True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books. (Herman Melville, Moby-Dick, 'The Blanket") At the end of her literary pilgrimage, Annie Dillard evokes "dancing" on the "fringes" of Shadow Creek as an act of "thanksgiving" to the mysterious, thorny beauty of creation (269). Now at the very onset of the book, the symbolic "waving" and "heaving" gestures of thanksgiving are more literally referred to as an awakening: REVUE FRANCHISE D'?TUDES AM?RICAINES 33</page><page sequence="2">Nathalie Cochoy These are [...] pictures you dream as the final wave heaves you up on the sand to the bright and drying air. You remember pressure [...] But the air hardens your skin; you [...] remembefr] nothing. (4) In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, awakening to the ambiguity of signs appears to be a prerequisite to the thankful celebration of the "palpable wonders of the world" (Melville1). As an attentive reader and writer, Annie Dillard is well aware of the limitations of language. Although she willingly asserts that words are necessary to the discovery of the real ("Seeing is of course very much a matter of verbalization. Unless I call my attention to what passes before my eyes, I simply won't see it" [33]), she also lucidly exposes the dilemma of nature writing: when naming the wild in order to reveal its fragile value, one also runs the risk of taming it into the "freeze frames" of knowledge. However, it is precisely by confessing the limitations of her art that the author succeeds in drawing an analogy between the exposure of discourse and the vulnerability of nature. In other words, it is by resorting to metatextuality that she makes the constant hesitations and emendations of her prose coincide with the permanent shedding and growing of the world. She thus invents a new form of poetic kinship between the scarred texture of writing and the wounded substance of the world. Like the "paw prints in blood" that the narrator's hunting cat leaves on her bare breast during the night (3), like the "trail of blood" that the narrator's grooved "arrow" forms on the pages of the "book" (15), Annie Dillard's discourse testifies to the immediate, reciprocal impression of the time marked surfaces of subject, landscape and text.2 In this respect, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is not so much an herb-book or a scrap-book as a skin-book, gathering on its iridescent surface the imprint of the fleeting contact between self, space and speech.3 In this book, indeed, the recurrent motif of the skin not only acts as a metaphor of Dillard's writing but also as a structural process revealing the engagement of the prose in the natural world. Turned inward and outward, the skin first appears as a poetic device simultaneously reflecting and incarnating the way in which the constant self-questioning of discourse does not so much estrange words from the world as it reveals their vibrant "inhabitation"4 of nature. Now, this direct involvement of language in the material world also mutely illustrates the author's ethical commitment to nature and to man. Annie Dillard first resorts to metatextuality in order to adjust her words to the fluctuations of nature. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, the narrator systematically explains what she sees or says. However, the rambling comments on the inadequacy of language, the roaming digressions on the limits of scientific or literary representations or the infinite display of the intertextual elaboration of discourse do not seclude the text from the world. On the contrary, they contribute 34 N? 106 D^CEMBRE 2005</page><page sequence="3">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek to the revelation of the pulsing substance of language and its immediate involvement in the natural realm. In this respect, the narrator's exposition of the shuttling movement of discourse between the delusions of rational explanations and the constraints of imaginative speculations does not so much expose the process of natural creation as it takes part in it. It performatively reveals that, in Dillard's writing, nature neither appears as an original fact, necessarily betrayed by the reflections of art, nor as a cultural construct, indifferent to the "rawness" of the world,5 but as the confluence between the constant transfiguration of discourse and the continuous metamorphosis of landscape.6 Annie Dillard thus refers to the laws of quantum mechanics in order to explain that all "scientific" attempts at realism are bound to remain deceptive. Repeating that she "do[es]n't know what's going on here" (10), she particularly dwells on the Principle of Indeterminacy that "saw the light" (205) at the very moment it discovered the opacity of all things. She logically concludes that since "we know for sure that there is no knowing," we "cannot study nature per se, but only our own investigation of nature" (205). However, this acknowledgement of the "unhandsome" quality of the world (Emerson) does not imply that nature is reducible to an intransitive, self-sufficient cultural construct: "how many times have I learned not to stare at the back of my hand when I could look out at the creek?" (271). In Dillard's writing, indeed, the twists and turns of logical explanations, the stuttering questionings of language and the intertextual, mnemonic or poetic digressions of discourse do not display the "not-there" of nature writing (Buell) but the rhythmic physicality of language itself. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in particular, Annie Dillard situates her writing of nature on the threshold where the meditative ramblings of the mind ephemerally crystallize into the ever-changing substance of nature?where the metatextual or metaphoric "waves" of discourse skillfully coincide with the "heaving" materiality of the world in order to weave the throbbing texture of the book. Now, this meticulous adjustment of the metatextual layers of discourse to the tangible surfaces of the world is also ethically oriented. Indeed, the skin like texture of the book is both openly receptive and silently, yet forcefully, committed to the natural world. Annie Dillard adopts no militant or moralizing stance. Eschewing the cliched rhetoric of moralizing discourses, she does not pass judgment on man's economic, ideological or artistic attempts to colonize the real. At the beginning of the book, the narrator refuses to interpret the bloody "stains" or "emblems" that she discovers on her skin: "I never knew as I washed [...] whether I'd purified myself or ruined the blood sign of the Passover" (4).7 However, the graceful adaptation of language to the constant regeneration of landscape appears as a grateful tribute to the precious value of nature. It performatively presents the author's thankful acknowledgment of the natural world. Indeed, like the mangroves8 of the Galapagos Islands, those "dancers" that "make their own soil [...] from scratch" (Teaching 147), the REVUE FRANCHISE D'tTUDES AMERICAINES 35</page><page sequence="4">Nathalie Cochoy choreographic exposure of discourse faithfully celebrates the lesson in survival that nature may give to man?"If survival is an art, then mangroves are artists of the beautiful" (Teaching 146). In this respect, the patient, exhaustive "interest" that the author develops in the renewal of nature is both revealing and rewarding.9 By making the malleable structures of discourse "dance" (277) with the metamorphic surfaces of the world, Annie Dillard intimates that man may learn from nature how to turn his haunting awareness of death into a process of creation. "Write as if you were dying," the author advises in The Writing Life (590).10 And in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, she demonstrates that a close attention to the alchemical powers of nature can help man transform his consciousness of loss into an act of creation?"And shadow itself may resolve into beauty" (71). Indeed, by recreating the flow from Shadow Creek to Tinker Creek, she suggests that a receptive yet respectful observation of nature might help man convert his awareness of death into an act of survival. In this connection, the narrative treatment of the motif of the fall is quite significant. Indeed, far from mourning the disappearance of the Edenic age of innocence when the world was still "unraveled from reason" (32), the author incorporates the motif of the fall into her depiction of nature. She first literally refers to the fall and rebirth of the leaves, the deer's hair or the snake's skin. But she also structurally recreates the destructive and regenerative processes of nature. Indeed, knowing that "[t]he texture of space is a condition of time" (141), Annie Dillard eludes the lures of static description in order to emulate the falling and rising of the world. In this respect, the recurrent evocation of the papery skin of a frog, eaten alive by a giant water bug, acts as a warning against the delusion of timeless mimicry. Compared to the "schematic diagram of an amphibian" (7), the seemingly unblemished skin of the frog exposes the way in which the shapely yet empty depictions of naturalism are bound to "swfc" in the narcissistic waters of oblivion (8). On the contrary, the collection of "half-eaten, rusted, blighted, blistered, mined, snipped, smutted, pitted, puffed, sawed, bored, and rucked" skins that pave the way of the narrative (230-231) heralds the creative potential of the palimpsest of references and reflections that constitutes the book. Indeed, the sloughed-off snakeskin, the scales of the copperhead, the wings of the monarch, "as transparent as the skin peeled from sunburn, and as tough as a parchment of flensed buffalo hide" (260), the new "pelage" of the deer, the dimples of the tulip-leaf, the wrinkles of the ice forming on water, or the "molting and shedding" of the year in autumn present the way in which the infinite interlacing of literal and literary elements not only expresses the ineffable changes of the outside world, but also experiences their reviving virtues. Like the falling mockingbird that gracefully unfurls his wings "just a breath before he would have dashed to the ground" (10),11 Annie Dillard's writing artfully 36 N? 106 DlrCEMBRE 2005</page><page sequence="5">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek imitates the changing forms of nature in order to illustrate the wonderful lesson in survival that nature may give to man?"nature is a fan dancer born with a fan" (206).12 I shall thus attempt to show that, far from alienating words from the world, Annie Dillard's metatextual exposure of discourse favours a poetic and ethical engagement of language in the natural realm. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, the "touch-and-go" (204) between language and landscape simultaneously appears as a faithful revelation and as a thankful celebration of the transfigurative gifts of nature?"I fall and I dance" (88). I shall first consider the "shreds of creation" (139)?the legends and leitmotivs, the learned quotations or anecdotal digressions?that the author interlaces in the narrative. As I shall try to show, the intricate, malleable texture of discourse partakes of the complexity of the world it aims to depict. This will lead me to dwell on the ever-changing scales of perception that Annie Dillard resorts to in order to catch a glimpse of the present. Indeed, if "the whole show has been on fire from the word go" (11), if "the whole world sparks and flames" (11), the textual lenses the author uses provide some relief for the eyes?they relay and allay vision by contributing to the "defin[ition] of the real" (63). I shall thus suggest that the author's self-reflexive comments on the art of seeing not only tactfully disclose the luminous shadows of the creek, but also forcefully magnify the rewarding effects of man's opening up to the infinite complexity of the world. This will lead me to evoke the way in which the coincidence of the metatextual layers of discourse with the metamorphic surfaces of nature gracefully embodies the lesson in survival that nature may give to man. In this respect, the oxymoronic skeins of lyricism and triviality filigreed in the narrative discreetly recall that it is only by respecting the essential difference of the natural that man will discover the precious nature of the commonplace. Indeed, like the arrows the author used to draw as a child in order to lead passers-by to the pennies she had previously hidden in the scenery (17), Annie Dillard's writing aims at guiding the reader towards some intimate discovery of the sacred, creative value of nature. Going about "soft-side out to the wind and thorns" (65), man will know how to "save his skin" (178) if he learns how to dance with the ceaseless transformations of the world.13 Shreds When considering the puzzling movement of migrating monarchs, Annie Dillard declares: "I don't know. I'd like to see it. Or I'd like to be it" (258). Similarly, when evoking the fleeting fullness of the present, her writing evolves from sceptical introspection to sensory perception and structural identification. In the chapter entitled "The Present," the narrator first speculates on the limits of language: she explains that even if "a certain REVUE FRANCHISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES 37</page><page sequence="6">Nathalie Cochoy amount of interior verbalization is helpful to enforce the memory of whatever it is that is taking place" (82), self-consciousness generally hinders the synaesthetic experience of the "now" (80). However, this metatextual statement strangely coincides with a moment of sensory delight as the narrator stares at the mountains while stroking the fur of a dog and sipping a cup of coffee. The scene, oddly situated at the gas station, illustrates the way in which the author's meditations on the limits of language can paradoxically favour a sensory appraisal of the present that permanently fuels man's desire to live. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Annie Dillard turns the metatextual ramblings of discourse into formal demonstrations of the sensitive physicality of language. As we shall see, the random, spinning movements of enunciation, the meticulous stitching of intertextual references and the gradual intertwining of leitmotivs14 endow the narrative with a flexible, tangible quality. They expose the direct participation of language in the "multiple, overlapping intricacies and forms" (139) that constitute the landscape. As Ruth Torrent explains: "[Annie Dillard s'interesse a] la structure-reelle ou potentielle-de toute chose, y compris la forme physique de l'univers, celles des cellules vivantes, ou les changements de la forme dus au milieu" (1990, 96). Now, by taking an active part in the constant transfiguration of landscape, the text also succeeds in revealing the essential value of the present. For if "it goes without saying" that the present is a "canvas" (84) or a "skin" (89) that is "constantly being ripped apart and washed downstream" (84), the mute, ever-changing texture of discourse immediately recalls that the "pressure" (88) of the present can also be life-giving. The transformation of the metatextual questionings of discourse into concrete manifestations of the engagement of language in the natural world first appears in the isotopy the narrator creates between the apparently spontaneous roaming of her mind and the whimsical rambling of her steps. Studded with references to the moment of enunciation ("now"), the narrator's discourse is both linear and circuitous. As the frequent juxtaposition of contradictory arguments demonstrates, the progression of discourse largely depends on the reversibility of all statements. The narrator thus elaborates on her literary oscillation between knowledge and mystery, between the illusive reliability of the library and the alienating reality of the wild (179-182). She also expatiates on her moral wavering between terror and fascination, between the frightening decay and the regenerative beauty of nature (245). However, this rigorous alternation of arguments does not simply evince the narrator's scrupulous quest for objectivity. It also underlines the involvement of language in the ebbing and flowing of the world. In accordance with Heraclitus's statement about the vagaries of the world ("It scatters and gathers [...] it comes and goes" [186]), the narrator 38 N? 106 DECEMBRE 2005</page><page sequence="7">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek exhibits the sudden halts ("All right then" [244]), alterations ("It calls to mind [...]" [43]) or accretions ("I remember something else I saw this week" [231]) of the text. She thus formally recreates her solitary wanderings through the landscape. Indeed, although the actual topography of Tinker Creek, "in a valley in Virginia's Blue Ridge" (11), remains rather vague, the looping movements of discourse around the same favorite spots endow the scenery with a familiar quality. The reader gradually becomes acquainted with the narrator's writing or walking places?the table with its lamp and goldfish bowl, the window facing the Osage orange and the hedge adorned with mantis cases, the deer pasture, the sycamore log bridge and the island shaped like a tear... By dint of repetitions, Annie Dillard's narrative does not so much depict nature as it actually inhabits it. Furthermore, the intertextual references that the author intertwines into the narrative contribute to the revelation of the infinite connections of the natural world?"We walk around; we see a shred of the infinite possible combinations of an infinite variety of forms" (147). Instead of seeing the world with a "naked eye," Annie Dillard perceives nature through the various layers of legends, literary quotations and scientific reports that have fallen into her "eye-pouch" (134). However, far from screening the world from view, this "expedition" of discourse into the cultural realm favours an "encounter" of the subject and the text with the boundless diversity of the world.15 Blurring the distinction between expression and experience, Annie Dillard's web of references first leads to the unveiling of the subject's vibrant adjustment to the endless complexity of the world. The narrator frequently alludes to her hesitation between reading and living. She explains that if she turns to books to check the truth of what she sees (the biting of a snake by a mosquito, for example [230]), she also turns to facts to test the reliability of what she reads (the killing of a bee by an echo, for example [266]). At the level of discourse, the assemblage of references and reflections also illustrates the subject's oscillation (rocking?) between evidence and invention. Indeed, exceeding their traditional documentary function, Annie Dillard's miscellaneous quotations open up to myths, rumours and recollections. Referring to religion, painting, literature, philosophy, biology, geology, entomology or astrophysics, they also include Indian legends, Eskimo tales, journalistic reports, anonymous anecdotes or childhood memories... Recalling that living is always by fiction, they discreetly suggest that the function of intertextuality is less to attest the objective veracity of the narrated events than to unveil the shaping influence of imagination on one's perception of the world. Indeed, the constant "tinkering"16 of discourse creates echoes and reflections that immediately deliver the most ineffable aspects of the world. Marc Chenetier explains: REVUE FRANCHISE d'eTUDES AMERICAINES 39</page><page sequence="8">Nathalie Cochoy Experience exceeds a language that can only stultify and reduce it. The extravagance of the world demands literary wanderings that may deliver, at some places of intersection, enough reverberation and echoes to cover what one's own words alone cannot. The parasitic feeding upon an intertext that itself tinkers with available materials that make vision possible is the key to an ever-expanding consciousness apt to render the wonders of the natural world and its messages to the cultured consciousness. /irk (1990, 172) In the chapter entitled "Seeing," for instance, the author quotes from Van Gogh's letters and Peter Freuchen's travel narratives before summarizing various accounts of Marius von Senden's "wonderful book," Space and Sight. By juxtaposing the painter's reflections and the explorer's reports on the blinding effects of darkness and light, she thus formally presents the reverberating site where the spatial intertwining of quotations immediately illuminates the unutterable wonders of the world. Indeed, when the narrator evokes von Senden's book, the various examples of cataract operations she lists in the narrative performatively enact the revelations they depict. Exposing the relativity of meaning, they establish a direct coincidence between the patchwork of quotations and the "color-patches" of the world (31).17 Just as the patients evolve from a tactile apprehension to a "pure" vision of the world, "unencumbered by meaning" (28), the author's interlacing of quotations favours an epiphanic coincidence between the motley texture of the book and the mysterious twinkle of nature: at the end of the chapter, the narrator suddenly sees her backyard cedar turn into a "tree with the lights in it." Like the surgeons' "oppressive" operations (30), Annie Dillard's impressive array of quotations gradually teaches the reader to see the world differently. By dint of digressions, the author succeeds in transmuting her polyphonic attempts at naming nature into an immediate initiation to its evanescent presence. But by dint of repetitions, she also deftly transfigures her doomed attempts at appropriating the "awesome wonders" (10) of the world into a direct approximation of their sacred value. Indeed, the stuttering repetitions, the endless quest for definition and the constant deferment of formulation that feature prominently in the narrative do not so much betray the author's distrust of the gifts of language as they corroborate her unflinching pilgrim's faith in its capacity for renewal. Evading the sterile malediction of circularity (the caterpillars' stubborn spinning around [67]),18 Annie Dillard's leitmotivs evolve as they recur. In their subtle variations, they gradually acquire the kaleidoscopic radiance of sacred emblems. Thus, the tree with the lights in it, the frog eaten alive by the giant water bug, the mockingbird's free fall, the Polyphemus moth crawling down the driveway or the sharks heaving and roiling in the waves of amber are repeatedly alluded to in the narrative. Migrating in space and time, they are constantly 40 n? 106 decembre 2005</page><page sequence="9">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek sifted by discourse until they suddenly precipitate into an iridescent aggregate of motifs (99-100, 147-48). Therefore, far from signifying the incommensurability between language and experience, Annie Dillard's periphrastic leitmotivs patiently, passionately and miraculously flesh out the creative promises of nature. Wanting and waiting for a definite form, they reveal the precious value of the present. The rambling movement of discourse, the open interlacing of quotations and the radiant recurrence of leitmotivs thus gradually bring into focus the tangible, endlessly renewed relief of the text. Indeed, by resorting to cataracts of repetitions, references and refractions, the author performatively unveils the reviving virtues of nature. Now, this life-giving influence of nature also appears in the scenes of intense stalking or sudden revelation. When the narrator sees the "tree with the lights in it," she is also born from it: "It was less like seeing than like being for the first time seen." (36) Scales "Rapt and enwrapped" (224) by nature and culture alike, the narrative voice totters on the flimsy border between "concentration" and "receptiveness" (83). Quite paradoxically, it is by focusing on her own process of vision that the narrator catches a glimpse of the most transient components of nature. Just as she only sees fish within her own blue shadow, from which they immediately flee (187), she only evokes the evanescence of nature through the self-reflexive shades of her own discourse. Now, by turning her comments on the art of seeing into instruments and objects of vision, she also intimates that a close yet careful observation of nature might help man transform his awareness of death into a means of revelation of the fleeting beauty of life. Knowing that the scalding flagrance of the world threatens to burn language into "flakes" (41) or "fakes" (42),19 Annie Dillard opts for an anamorphic description of nature. She first operates a displacement of the object seen to the process of seeing. Tinker Creek thus becomes the Mason jar where she first and foremost scrutinizes her own sight: "I [am] walking along the edge of the island to see what I [can] see in the water" (7). Constantly testing her visual capacities, the narrator methodically theorizes about her own sensorial experiments. For instance, she lengthily expounds her contradictory ways of looking at nature: the "Via positiva" which implies an active search, a dogged hunting and prying into the unfathomable mysteries of the world, and the "Via negativa," based on a silent, patient waiting, an empty readiness for the gifts of the real (186). However, the author also explains that the verbalization of experience is both necessary and damaging to the perception of the world. As a consequence, she REVUE FRANCHISE D'ETUDES AIv1?RICAINES 41</page><page sequence="10">Nathalie Cochoy attempts to turn the text's incessant chatter into a vibrant, sensitive membrane that is most likely to refract "the realm of the real where subjects and objects act and rest purely, without utterance" (35). Indeed, far from being informative, the author's developments on the art of seeing appear as lenses simultaneously preventing and provoking the discovery of the evanescent wonders of nature. Commenting on Teaching a Stone to Talk, Marc Chenetier evokes the overriding function of lenses in Dillard's writing: // n'est pas de realite brute dont la perception et Vanalyse se dispenseraient de lentilles. Parmi elles, des jumelles, des telescopes, des longues-vues, des microscopes : tout ce qui permet de dissimuler le flou comme de le crier, d'apercevoir le net au sein du nebuleux et d'installer la confusion dans un reel tenu trop facilement pour connu, d'annuler les distances qui fondent les usuels rapports, d'en creer d'autres, qui permettent de juger autrement les choses, de substituer une unique echelle a des objets de forme ou de taille dijferentes, defaire se cotoyer et Vintime et Vimmense et, partant, de les comparer, d'en contaminer mutuellement la presence [...]. (1011) In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Annie Dillard also resorts to literal and literary lenses in order to explore the invisible. Like the welder's goggles that people wear to see an eclipse,20 her remarks on the art of seeing simultaneously conceal and reveal the creative radiance of invisibility. But in doing so, they also intimate that nature may help man reconcile (weld?) himself to his own humanity. Indeed, by facing his own disappearance in the mirror of nature, man will also soothingly discover the transient value of his life. The rambling comments on the art of seeing first appear as protective devices allowing the subject to explore the abyssal depths of invisibility without succumbing to their captivating spells. Annie Dillard is fascinated by the creative powers of disappearance. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, the bilateral symmetry of the chapters entitled "Seeing" and "Northing" suggests that the expansion of vision is intimately yoked to an anticipation of its "reduction" (255). In "Seeing," the narrator depicts the pervading opacity of sunset and the gathering tatters of the fog. In "Winter," she anaphorically invokes the mesmerizing magic of the falling night and snow: "It was like dying, this watching the world recede into deeper and deeper blues while the snow piled [...] It was like dying, that growing dimmer and deeper and then going out." (45) But the author is also intimately acquainted with the blinding effects of fascination?"[d]arkness appalls and light dazzles" (25). Like the telescopes or the microscopes she uses to discover the infinitely large (the shooting stars [25]) and the infinitely small (the amoebae [26]), the self-reflexive observations of discourse save her from being "brutalized" (181).21 Like the mirrored image of her own face on the surface of the water, they remind her of her humanity and prevent her from 42 N? 106 DECEMBRE 2005</page><page sequence="11">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek yielding to the absorbing powers of nature?"I'm dizzy, I fall in. This looking business is risky" (25). Indeed, the author's endless developments on the art of seeing gradually reveal the evanescent wonders of disappearance. Oscillating on the border between intellectual verbalization and sensorial perception, they succeed in presenting what is "almost impossible to see" (187): the blooming of plankton, the greening of the grass, the surfacing of the muskrat or the "spontaneous generation" of the fish?"sleight of fish" (188). As the narrator's eye is constantly "caught" by what it was not intending to see, the author's writing engraves the most elusive spurts of natural beauty on the ever-renewed margins of self-commentary. Thus, like Moses' shining skin after his indirect encounter with the "back parts" of God (208), Annie Dillard's protective and prospective comments on the art of seeing directly reveal the chiaroscuro shades and shapes of the world. However, this coincidence between the abyssal layers of discourse and the ineffable wonders of the world also recalls that the terror of death is coeval with the beauty of life?"Terror and a beauty insoluble are a ribband of blue woven into the fringes of garments of things both great and small" (27). Indeed, if nature is a magician who keeps erasing and conjuring up new worlds (13), the author is also the illusionist who discovers the world by holding her own words up to view. And if nature is a juggler who turns falling balls into spurts of beauty (223), the author is also the artist who transmogrifies man's perception of invisibility into rewarding promises of poetry. Skeins In "Flood," Annie Dillard evokes the transmutation of the "mediating" creek into an overwhelming object of vision (154). Throughout the narrative, she also exposes the process by which discourse is transformed into a palpable object of perception. Continually shaping, stretching and sculpting language, she gradually invests the text with the plastic quality of a skin whose pulsating grain not only reflects the infinite complexity of the world but also suggests a way of living in it. Likened to a "taut skin" (219), a "pure slip of bone" (255) or a translucent "condensation of the air" (275), the neutral, strangely impersonal narrative voice records the shaping influence of nature on the subject's opening up to otherness.22 Indeed, the narrator elaborates on her susceptibility to the variations of landscape: she feels the "now" with her finger (99), tastes the weather with her tongue (42) and lets the moment's light print on her "silver gut" (33). But this impression of nature on the subject's body favours an immediate participation of the self in the mute, throbbing surfaces of the outside world: "I retreat?not inside myself, but REVUE FRANCAISE d'ETUDES AIVi?RICAINES 43</page><page sequence="12">Nathalie Cochoy outside myself, so that I am a tissue of senses. [...] I am the skin of water the wind plays over; I am petal, feather, stone." (203) Likewise, the adjustment of discourse to the constant metamorphosis of nature calls for an aesthetic, but also ethical, engagement of the text in the tangible world. Indeed, Annie Dillard's discourse is so intimately attuned to the transformations of the world that it gradually acquires the power of influencing them. The protean, plastic quality of the prose first evinces the susceptibility of discourse to the constant alterations of the world. Covering a wide range of tones and registers, the narrative voice is alternately confidential or didactic, softly melancholic or hilariously comic.23 It also indifferently assumes slangy airs ("Fish gotta swim and bird gotta fly" [64]) or Shakespearian manners ("To shelter, starlings and coot; bow to the wind" [54]). Besides, the lists of questions, statistics or nouns display the infinite malleability of the prose. Thus, the dynamic enumerations of verbs (77, 218) and the incantatory lists of insects (232), flowers (112), land dust (124), algae or larvae (120) endow the sentences with the musicality of a foreign language. However, by imitating the transformations of nature, the text also acquires the capacity of anticipating them. For instance, the alliterative echoes and handling of syntax not only foreground the resiliency of the verbal fabric but also foretell the fertile or fateful pressures that hover in the air. In "Nightwatch" and "Fecundity," the narrator's wrought language acts as a harbinger of change: it incorporates the wafting fragrance of the "flowers that flecked the bank" (217) or the dense stickiness of the "gluey gobs of bacteria that clog the lobes of lungs" (167). But in "Flood," the rhythmic, rolling stream of sound effects?"the rabbit [...] the rabies [...] the bees"? adumbrates the impending surge of water (150). By embracing the quivering surfaces of nature, the narrator's reversible discourse gradually acquires the oracular power to depict and predict the magic transfigurations of the world. Changing with the world, the text presents a way of changing the world. In this respect, its engagement is also ethical. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, indeed, Annie Dillard shows how rewarding a close yet considerate attention to otherness can be. By resorting to humour, she first dismisses the effusive flights of language in order to reveal the distance that is necessary to an intimate encounter with otherness. By sprinkling the text with cartoon like onomatopoeias (boom, whoop, puff, flash, chomp, ping, bingo or hurrah!), she educes her refusal of pathetic fallacy. And by staging her slapstick failure to conquer animals, she also blatantly derides all anthropomorphic attempts at eradicating the essential difference of the natural world. Indeed, like the ceaselessly whispering creek (60), the "stupid coot" (46) or the sleeping snake (226) remain unruffled by the narrator's burlesque strategies of visual or verbal approach. Humour thus allows the author to recall that it is only by respecting the distant strangeness of the 44 N? 106 DECEMBRE 2005</page><page sequence="13">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek natural world that man will discover its gratifying closeness. Noelle Batt underlines this magnified moment of presentation: [...] cette distanciation, ce detachement constituent la phase preliminaire de la rencontre et fonctionnent comme le signe de I'acceptation, de la reception bienveillante de I'autre. Le sujet-narrateur suspend son horizon d'attente. II n'anticipe pas. II ne s'empresse pas de se representer Vautre. II laisse a Vautre le temps de se presenter. II menage ainsi a son objet un espace de la presentation et un temps present magnifie. Now, by restraining the elevation of language towards some transcendent reality, the author also succeeds in unveiling the unforeseen beauty of the familiar. By dint of rhythmical associations or down-to-earth comparisons, she invents a new genre of surface lyricism recalling that transcendence may also be found in man's everyday life. In the descriptions, the contrastive tension of the text between the transcendent and the trite creates a rhythmic vibration of language that directly reveals the protracted magic of the present. In "Northing," for example, the lists of trees?"tulips and ashes, maples, sour wood, sassafras, locusts, catalpas, and oaks" (249)?feature as horizontal refractions of the picturesque falling of the leaves in autumn?"vertical trails of yellow color patches falling from nowhere to nowhere" (249). And more occasionally, the jarring comparisons between natural events and human habits do not so much contribute to the familiarization of the wild as they ingeniously highlight the magnificent strangeness of the commonplace. When the skin of the frog crumples like a kicked tent, when the abdomen of a moth swells like a smashed finger, when the clouds slide east like a tablecloth whipped off a table, when the tops of mountains shine like the blade of a kitchen knife, or when the moon, softly frayed like the heel of a sock, moves in the eastern sky like a smudge of chalk, the author makes manifest the precious refractions that the natural world unexpectedly casts on the dull and the trite. Like the velvet veneer of the monarch's wings, Annie Dillard's skin-like writing catches the radiance of the natural in order to educe the invisible grace of the ordinary?"the frailest depth of lapped scales" (250). Showing that the beauty of nature still "beats and shines" in spite of its imperfections (245), it suggests that nature may help man recover the precious value of his life. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Annie Dillard therefore resorts to metatextuality in order to transform her prose into a skin-like texture that gracefully adjusts itself to the ceaseless renewal of nature. Now, by making her words "dance" with the tangible world, she also generously illustrates the rewarding effects of man's "awakening" to the present. Indeed, by transforming the text into a gesture of expression and experience, she performatively recalls that a close observation of nature may help man to REVUE FRANCHISE D'ETUDES AMERICANS 45</page><page sequence="14">Nathalie Cochoy convert his awareness of death into an art of survival. In her analysis of Annie Dillard's "impressions" on Giacometti's Man Walking, Ruth Torrent establishes an analogy between the author's sculpted writing and the artist's "dancing" sculpture. She thus unveils Annie Dillard's Utopian wish to "draw" art and reality, but also death and life, intimately together in her "non-fiction" as well as in her "non-autobiography": We see from her earliest impressions that her idol is the image of movement captured in still form. [...] This is art at its purest: the form and the subject correspond so closely as to be almost, but never completely, indistinguishable. [...] "I drew Man Walking in his normal stalking pose and, later, dancing with his arms in the air"24 [...] Dance persists as one of Dillard's most successfully borrowed and adapted images of the intricate relationships between form and content in artistic expression. (2(m 3QQ_m)25 Knowing that you can bruise your heel when you bruise the head of a barnacle (168), Annie Dillard keeps dancing with the moving surfaces of nature. Slowly, sensuously, she adjusts the skin of her words to the "crawling, crawling" of the moth (100), the "taper, taper, taper" of the snake (228) or the "growing [...] growing [...] growing" of the world (114). And softly, secretly, she invites the reader to join her on the fringes of Shadow Creek?precisely because it is so windy tonight in the valley that when she lets him in, she will also teach him not to close the door (49).

Commenting on the skin of the white whale ("The Blanket"), Philippe Jaworski explains: "Au mystere des 'hieroglyphes' qui ne designent que ce mystere meme, s'ajoute l'effet paradoxal de la courtepointe de lard. D'une part, cette derniere rend l'epaisseur charnelle du Monstre deba table, decomposable - sans pour autant que cette entame permette de liberer le secret de cette pyramide de silence. II faut done [...] chercher ce secret dans 1'existence meme de signes, pas ailleurs. D'autre part, cette couverture, ce capitonnage de graisse permet au Monstre de faire 1'experience simultanee du Dedans et du Dehors: le repli confortable sur la chaleur interieure et l'ouverture a la froidure exterieure." (235) 2. "L'empreinte est a la fois la receptivite d'un support informe et l'activite d'une forme: sa force est la melee des deux" (Nancy 21). Annie Dillard acknowledges this "force": "What I aim to do is not so much learn the names of the shreds of creation that flourish in this valley, but to keep myself open to their meanings, which is to try to impress myself at all times with the fullest possible force of their very reality" (139). 3. In this sense, the skin could be compared to Michel Collot's "matiere-emotion": "L'emotion est done elle aussi liee a un horizon, qui deborde le sujet mais par lequel il s'ex prime. Elle est le versant affectif de cette relation au monde qui me semble constitutive de 1'ex perience poetique. Mais plus encore que l'horizon, elle echappe a la representation, et ne peut prendre forme qu'en investissant une matiere, qui est a la fois celle du corps, celle du monde et celle des mots" (2-3). 4. Jean-Claude Pinson explains: "[HJabiter (exister) n'est pas simplement vivre. II nous faut des livres et des lettres pour nous arracher a renfermement dans le cycle repetitif des processus vitaux, pour inscrire notre habitation dans un monde commun plus durable que la simple vie. Mais pas n'importe quels livres: des livres qui fassent signe a la vie et non des livres mort-nes" (16). REVUE FRANCHISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES 47</page><page sequence="16">Notes 5. In this respect, Annie Dillard's writing escapes all forms of categorization. Indeed, Lawrence Buell recalls that the representation of nature often rests on two opposed yet com plementary premises: "First, that such categories as 'Nature', 'Wilderness', and 'Environment' are clearly Active constructs. What they are taken to mean is always mediated by cultural convention and individual imagination; and their connotations vary greatly according to place, time, and rhetorical context. In the second place, however, no less important to cultural theory must be the principle that neither the biogeological world nor even the human-built environment are reducible to a cultural construct, however much these have been shaped by human action. Even as humankind reconstructs nature, environment continues to regulate the terms of human existence?long after the transformation of so-called first (or unmodified) nature by so-called second nature [...]" (2003, 43). For the debate between Leo Marx and Lawrence Buell, see Hans Bak and Walter W Holbling's "Nature's Nation" Revisited. 6. Bruno Latour explains: "II semble que la reference ne soit pas ce que Ton designe du doigt ou ce qui, de l'exterieur, garantirait la verite d'un enonce, mais plutot ce qui demeure constant a travers une serie de transformations. La connaissance ne parlerait pas d'un monde reel exterieur auquel elle ressemblerait mimetiquement, mais d'un monde reel interieur dont elle assurerait la coherence et la continuite." (204) 7. Annie Dillard draws a comparison between the paw prints on her breast and a bed of roses (3). Now, as she further demonstrates, the beauty of roses can also signify an untimely death: when Algonquin Indians died of hunger, the "rash of pellagra appeared like tattooed flowers on their emaciated bodies?the roses of starvation." (270) 8. Quite significantly, this word gracefully combines humanity {man) and nature (grove). 9. In Pilgrim at Tinker Creek as well as in Teaching a Stone to Talk, the author reiterates her "interest" in the world. In these works, the word acquires an economic meaning. 10. "It was like dying" is also the first sentence of Teaching a Stone to Talk. In this case, the gerund suggests that it is only by discovering the precious, protracted value of the present that man will learn how to turn his awareness of death into a creative gesture (a genesis?). Now, as the ambiguous title of The Writing Life intimates, this transformation concerns space, speech and self: the title alludes to the life the author spends writing, but also to the marks that living nature engraves on the page. 11. The mockingbird is well known for its capacity to repeat, reverberate and regenerate the songs of other birds: "The mockingbird's invention is limitless; he strews newness about as casually as a god" (106). 12. Another emblem of this "fall and rise" of nature could be the acorn "pressured, blown, driven down with force and up with furl, making at once a power dive to grit and grand jete en Pair". (362) Once again, the alliterative accumulation of verbs and the sudden, visible intrusion of a foreign language are intimately attuned to the movements of nature. 13. In Teaching a Stone to Talk, the author relates the story of a burnt man whose pic ture she has taped to her mirror. She thus suggests that a precise, self-reflexive "covering" of the story can be more soothing than all forms of sympathetic identification: "there is no skin to hold [him] in" (83). 14. Annie Dillard often evokes the art of sewing. For instance, she describes a spider spinning her web ("It was a sort of Tinker Creek to her, from which she bore lightly in every direction an invisible news"), the Eskimos' stitching bird-skin underclothes (185) or the meta phoric interweaving of time and space ("Time is the warp and matter the weft of the woven tex ture of beauty in space, and death is the hurtling shuttle" [141]). 15. I am here quoting the subtitle of Teaching a Stone to Talk: Expeditions and Encounters. As Christine Montalbetti explains: "A l'aphasie devant ce qui echappe a la fini tude du lexique comme aux structures de langage, et dont le desordre intrinseque apparait de toute facon comme incompatible avec les exigences du texte litteraire, succede ainsi une apha 48 N? 106 DlrCEMBRE 2005</page><page sequence="17">Notes sie d'un autre ordre, fondee non plus sur la perception d'une heterogeneite, qui rendrait l'acte de langage impossible, en tant que tout enonce, si on pouvait seulement le forger, serait necessaire ment inadequat au monde, mais sur la connaissance d'une somme d'enonces deja disponibles, qui contraint toute entreprise referentielle nouvelle a se construire dans le double emploi." (55) 16.1 am here referring to Marc Chenetier's essay on "meta-intertextuality" in Thoreau, Melville, and Annie Dillard?"The occurrence of "tinkering" [in Thoreau's book] provides a welcome opportunity to raise the question of whether both Walden and Pilgrim at Tinker Creek are not together attempts at literary collage and montage, at putting together a text the structure of which is justified by an identical gesture of bringing together disparate elements of culture and nature in order to propose some meaning in life." (1990, 163) 17. In the "Afterword," Annie Dillard refers to the "index-cards" she has "filed" into the chapters of the book (280). Associated with surgery in The Writing Life, this "fingering" of the book has a deictic, but also a creative function (fingere, fictum: shape, model). It thus embodies the pharmakon-like quality of Annie Dillard's writing: the meticulous dissection of discourse also acts as a soothing delivery of words into the world of man. 18. The narrator unties the knot of the snakeskin (73-75) and disturbs the seasonal cyclicity of the narrative (memories of summer erupt in the middle of winter). 19. The narrator relates her successive discoveries of a pile of burnt books on a hill and of a "neatly stacked quarter-cord of fireplace logs manufactured of rolled, pressed paper" (42). 20.1 am here referring to "Total Eclipse," the first essay of Teaching a Stone to Talk. More significantly than humorously, Annie Dillard compares the eclipse of the sun to a "Life Saver." 21. The narrator is constantly at grips with her own verbal instruments. She thus won ders about the beauty of the word "sycamore" (87) or the ugliness of the word "fecundity" (163). She compares the various names of the muskrat (192) or questions the literal meaning of the "neck" of a snake (229). 22. Jean-Paul Goux resorts to the metaphor of the skin in order to evoke the continuous flow of the voice between body and language: "Parmi les proprietes qu'a la voix de faire de cer tains effets, j'aimerais retenir celles-ci: celle qui fait de la voix une peau, c'est-a-dire tout a la fois une enveloppe et un intermediate entre le sujet et 1'autre (on pourrait dire une friction); celle qui fait de la voix, dans sa liaison avec la parole, une coulee et une continuite; celle qui en fait un medium entre le corps et le langage, et par la meme une energie. Telles seraient les proprietes qui, en s'exer?ant simultanement dans telle experience d'une voix reelle, constitue raient le corps du desir de la voix dans l'ecriture." (149) 23. By directly addressing the narratee, the narrator's voice expands from the micro cosm of the self to the macrocosm of otherness: "You are God [...] You are a man [...] You are a starling [...]" (130). 24. The quotation is taken from An American Childhood. 25.1 would like to thank one of the anonymous reviewers of the RFEA for referring me to Ruth Torrent's thesis. In this remarkable work, Ruth Torrent thoroughly and most delicately explores the relations between text and nature, the intertwined processes of metatextuality and intertextuality, and all the subtleties of Annie Dillard's crafted yet endlessly living prose.
