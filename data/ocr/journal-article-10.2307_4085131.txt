New York, Macmillan. xiv + 546 pp. $14.95.-New editions of these three widely used or- nithology textbooks are now available. This review attempts to compare their appropriateness and value for the classroom, as well as for practicing ornithologists and laymen. Each text is organized in a some- what different fashion, but Table 1 presents an approximate breakdown by major topics. Asterisks indi- cate which books, in my opinion, give better treatments to various subject areas. This approach may not be entirely fair in all cases, as the authors did not have identical goals. Van Tyne and Berger make it clear (p. viii) that their book is intended primarily for graduate courses and as a reference work. Wallace and Mahan and Welty have written books appropriate for beginning as well as for advanced classwork, and also for readers with less than a B. A. in zoology. In awarding an asterisk (Table 1), about equal weight was given to 1) clarity of writing and illustration, 2) completeness and accuracy of information, and 3) citation of useful references. Publication of the five-volume series "Avian biology," edited by D. S. Farner and J. R. King (New York, Academic Press, 1971-1975), should have facilitated the revision of these three textbooks. Unfortu- nately, in all cases either the authors or their editors were unable to wait. Publication dates notwithstand- ing, Wallace and Mahan make not a single reference to this monumental work. Van Tyne and Berger refer only to volume 1, while Welty appears to have consulted volumes 1 and 2 extensively. An aspiring writer should not be discouraged from working on an ornithology textbook that taps the Farner and King treasures more effectively. This service would be doubly valuable, as the price of a complete Farner and King series puts it nearly out of reach for the average graduate student. Van Tyne and Berger is the only one of the three books that treats the living orders and families in any detail, and devotes some 55 pages largely to discussing the sorts of characteristics by which ornithologists attempt to classify birds. The treatment is quite extensive and includes a long list of references. There follows a one-page description for each of the families of living birds. These consist of a pen-and-ink drawing by Sutton of a representative species, a physical description of members of the family, information on range, habits, food, etc., and a list of references. Berger writes in his preface that Van Tyne considered these pages the heart of their book, and, indeed, it represents a monumental effort. Sadly, a beginning student will get relatively little from it-especially in gaining any appreciation for the passerine birds. This undoubtedly is less a reflection of any failing on the part of the authors than it is of the questionable "reality" of so many songbird families. The student will read (p. 771) that the Fringillidae range in length from 95 to 273 mm, have "wings short and rounded to long and rather pointed, . . tail short to long," and vary in color "from brown and gray in cryptic patterns to combinations of yellow, TABLE 1 COMPARATIVE EMPHASES, BY PERCENT OF CONTENTS, OF THE THREE TEXTS Subject area Wallace and Mahan Van Tyne and Berger Welty Classification 3 23* 2 Taxonomic characters 1 7* 1 Paleontology 1 4* 2 Speciation 1 0 3* Ecology and biogeography 8 7 15* Behavior 7 6* 7* Vocalizations (included in behavior) 6 4* Migration and orientation 7 6 6 Life history 21 14 24* Locomotion 4 2 4* Foods and feeding 4 3 3 Plumage and molt 6 7* 5 Anatomy and physiology 12 13 18* Conservation and man 14* 0 4 History of ornithology 5* 0 0 * Asterisks indicate the book or books that I consider present superior treatment of a particular subject. 396</page><page sequence="2">April 1977] Reviews 397 red, purple, blue, green, black, white, in bold patterns." On p. 763 the Ploceidae are shown to range in length from 76 to 648 mm, to have "wings short and rounded to long and pointed; tail very short to extremely long," and to vary in color "from brown and gray in cryptic patterns to yellow, red, purple, blue, green, black in bold patterns." Will any grasp of passerine relationships emerge from these pages for the beginning student? For that matter, will the advanced student learn much more than he or she already knows? My concern with the family-by-family review in Van Tyne and Berger is that these 169 pages, in an already expensive book, might better have included an in-depth discussion about the actual relationships (phylogeny?) among bird families, with plenty of space left over for something as valuable as a thorough glossary of ornithological terms. A glossary appears in none of the three texts under consideration, and its inclusion would have made the purchase of any one of them worthwhile by itself. Van Tyne and Berger's writing style is crisp and direct, with plenty of in-text citations and illustrations, and an extensive list of references at the end of each chapter. This is a good format, and when it is working well this book is better than the other texts for bringing a reader quickly to the sides of an issue and to the pertinent literature. The chapter on paleontology is very good. In contrast to Wallace and Mahan and Welty, Van Tyne and Berger include a discussion of the possible origin of Archaeopteryx from theropod as well as thecodont reptiles, and give space to both the cursorial and arboreal theories on the origin of flight. A chapter on plumage and molt is lengthy and especially well-written and illustrated, leaving the reader with a solid grasp of feather structure, arrangement and growth, and patterns of molt. The behavior chapter is heavy, with much terminology dropped on the reader in short space, but most important concepts (e.g. innate releasing mechanisms, ritualization, imprinting) are covered accurately if briefly, with access to literature. One important concept not discussed is that of search-image formation. The chapter on migration and orientation illustrates one of the major problems of the Van Tyne and Berger text. The information content (except for lacking a discussion on eruptive species) is very good, but the quality of the presentation is weakened by a series of marginally useful illustrations. On page 351 a full-page map shows the migratory route of the House Swallow in southeast Asia. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 13 appear in various places on the map. Presumably these numbers had some significance in the original article from which the figure was taken, but here they are presented without comment. Figures 17 and 18 are taken from an article by Bellrose and appear to show the number of birds censused along a migratory pathway in the midwestern United States. Yet, when cited in the text, the authors are discussing the altitude at which birds are known to migrate. In fact, this sort of strange, almost unconsidered use of borrowed figures is widespread in Van Tyne and Berger and greatly weakens the whole book. For example, on p. 480 we read: "Two eggs form the clutch for many Central American tyrant flycatchers, troupials, tanagers, and fringillids, whereas members of these families breeding in the United States usually lay 4 to 6 eggs (Fig. 9)." Figure 9 proves to be a photograph of an Eastern Wood Pewee nest-containing 3 eggs. All three texts provide good descriptive accounts of the breeding cycles of birds. The reader of any will gain an understanding and appreciation of bird courtship, nest construction, eggs and nestlings, with numerous examples of different avian life histories. My comments and evaluation are directed toward the treatment of various aspects of life history strategy. Such fascinating and important topics as clutch size determination, mating systems, and brood parasitism do not receive equal treatment. Van Tyne and Berger begin with a chapter on courtship and nest building, which includes a discussion of territoriality. Presumed causes of the evolution of territoriality are not considered in sufficient detail. Polygamy is described, but factors leading to the evolution of different types of mating systems are not discussed. A second chapter on eggs and young does a good job with brood parasitism, but gives too brief an account of various theories on clutch-size determination. This book will be expensive for many readers. In the preface Berger notes that (p. viii) ". . . some important subjects had to be mentioned very briefly where pertinent in several chapters, and still other subjects . . . not at all," presumably to hold down the size of the book. Yet I count about 80 photographs of birds, taking from one-half to a full page each, that have no direct relevance to the text discussion. Some pictures are desirable, but this is excessive. Two of the subjects receiving very brief treatment are physiology and ecology. This is most unfortunate, as few topics are more interesting to students today or more at the forefront of ornithological research. Of 18 pages devoted to physiology, about 8 are wasted on photographs of birds and tables of breathing rates, heart rates, and body temperatures for various bird groups. There is no discussion of temperature- metabolism curves, thermal neutral point, energy dynamics, or metabolic rate in relation to body mass. Hibernation and torpor are mentioned but never defined. A chapter in Van Tyne and Berger on bird distribution includes a good if somewhat brief account of</page><page sequence="3">398 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 94 avian biogeography and ecology. Coverage of island biogeography, the niche concept, and diversity, is adequate and provides good access to the literature. One thing missing is the historic factor, with no discussion of evolution or examples of speciation in particular groups. In fact, the words evolution and speciation are not in the book's index. One would expect Van Tyne and Berger to give excellent treatment to structure and function in birds. Perhaps because of such high expectations, the book is a disappointment. The chapter on locomotion is very strange. It is well-written and illustrated on subjects such as wing slotting, wing shape, hummingbird flight, diving, and flightlessness, but disregards the actual mechanics of basic flapping flight by quoting Greenewalt to the effect that it is too complex to study. The chapter on general avian anatomy is of limited value. It presupposes a working knowledge of vertebrate anatomy. Terms literally are poured on the reader. Most disappointing are the illustrations, which range from fair to terrible. Most are gleaned from other sources and contain many terms never mentioned in the text. The chapter will be useful only to advanced students, and only then as a literature source. Even this function is crippled by absence of reference to the Farner and King volumes. "The life of birds" is written in eloquent, often rather flowery, prose. Welty warns us to expect anthropomorphism, and indeed we get it. "Like a man who claims he sings his best while taking a bath, most birds are definitely influenced in their song by environmental conditions" (p. 2 13). "At first glance, it seems unlikely that birds . . . could possibly have descended from the lethargic, cold-blooded, earth- grubbing reptiles" (p. 498). "Another substitution for the usual pattern of incubation, and one much lazier than that of incubator birds, is brood parasitism" (p. 323). The information content per page is much lower in Welty than it is in Van Tyne and Berger. At the same time, Welty is a gifted writer, and he has given his work a true style. It is by far the most enjoyable of the three books to sit down and read. Perhaps to improve the flow of the text, literature citations are often too few; bold-face type and italics are used only sparingly for the introduction of new terms. Tables and figures are placed in the text near discussions upon which they bear, but reference to those tables and figures rarely occurs in the text itself. These features may help the text to read smoothly, but they also make it more difficult to use as a reference work. The advanced student will find this especially frustrating. Welty's talent as a writer serves him best in describing the structure and function of birds. An exception is the section on plumage and molt; the text lacks a good illustration of external anatomy-both Van Tyne and Berger, and Wallace and Mahan are better on this subject. The chapter on flight is excellent. Welty is at his finest here, with careful and detailed descriptions of how birds fly-or how we think they fly. The behavior section is good. There is a highly readable introduction to the nature/nurture question, and a good account, with examples, of basic terminology. Displacement behaviors are not adequately defined, and ritualization deserves more emphasis than it gets. In a separate chapter on social behavior, imprinting receives exhaustive treatment. Unfortunately the subject of mixed species flocking-a fascinating one- receives only brief mention. In fairness, the other texts have the same failing. Welty devotes all or most of five chapters to avian internal anatomy and physiology. The material is presented carefully and will be understandable to a student with any sort of general biology background. The first chapter, "bones and muscles," is well-illustrated except for a much-needed drawing of a skull. As elsewhere, the advanced student will want more in-text literature citations. A chapter entitled "blood, air, and heat" is excellent, giving by far the best treatment of any of these works to subjects such as avian lung function, thermoregulation, hibernation and torpor, and diving physiology. Another solid chapter describes excretion, reproduction, and photoperiodism. Ultimate versus proximate factors that might determine the timing of breeding are clearly distinguished. Welty devotes much of his book to evolutionary ecology, with chapters on biogeography, ecology, population regulation, and evolution. An extensive treatment of life history strategies includes 6 chapters on the breeding cycle. Many good references are provided, and it appears that Welty has made a serious and often successful attempt to keep abreast of developments in these active areas of ornithological research. A major weakness-perhaps the major weakness in Welty-is the inclusion of statements likely to confuse the reader about the ways in which natural selection does and does not work. In many cases Welty seems to be invoking group selection as a major factor in evolution. Yet this term is never used, and one begins to suspect that instead these are instances of faulty evolutionary logic. In a discussion on the functions of territoriality we read that (p. 226) "territorial spread...works to create a standby population of birds ready to take over in times of emergency and to keep optimum habitats producing birds." A section on clutch size observes that (p. 304) "nature seems rarely to push a species' reproductive performance much beyond a comfortable 'live and let live' level." It is fortunate that Darwin read Malthus and not Welty on this subject.</page><page sequence="4">April 1977] Reviews 399 In terms of space, Welty's book contains by far the most pages on ecology and biogeography (Table 1). The first chapter on population regulation is highly readable, with numerous examples of the sorts of factors that can and evidently do regulate density, but the material is largely descriptive, and deals less with the theories of population dynamics (e.g. the role of territoriality, over-winter survival, density- dependent versus independent regulation, etc.). This is unfortunate, as ornithologists have figured heavily in these debates. The chapter on community ecology contains much solid descriptive information, includ- ing sections on environmental factors influencing avian community structure, the niche concept and competition, succession, and descriptions of major habitat types. Once again, many interesting but more theoretical aspects are not discussed-e.g. patterns of diversity, succession and diversity, species packing. Curiously, the competitive exclusion principle is well discussed, not here but in a later chapter on evolution and speciation. The chapter on the geography of birds includes careful descriptions of biogeographic realms. A good discussion of island biogeography is included, although the mathematical aspects of the MacArthur- Wilson model are missing. Welty minimizes the possible importance of continental drift more than he should. The chapter contains a number of platitudes such as (p. 433): "Races of birds living in cooler climates are more likely to be migratory than warm-climate relatives." These seem unnecessary even for an introductory text. Wallace and Mahan's "An introduction to ornithology," now in its third edition, is well written and contains much interesting descriptive material. It is the only book that covers the history of ornithology and the techniques for making a bird skin. The section on conservation is extensive and useful. Unfortu- nately this book falls short in most attempts at analysis and synthesis, and in leading the reader to the literature in areas of current research. One need not believe in the infallibility of the late R. H. MacArthur to be shocked that not a single one of his works is cited anywhere in this text. Hard-working researchers whose important studies are passed over will be chagrined to find that Wallace cites his own 1939 study on the Gray-cheeked Thrush at least 13 times. New chapters on behavior and ecology by the junior author contain no mention of such things as displacement behavior, redirection, vacuum activity, ritualization, species diversity, population regula- tion, or species packing. The chapter on biogeography contains good descriptions of faunal realms, life zones, and biotic provinces of North America. Neither island biogeography nor geographic pattern in species diversity is discussed. The following statement gives a very misleading impression of continental drift (p. 336): "One aspect of the theory is that a tropical or subtropical Antarctica (Gondwanaland) was the place of origin of animal life, which subsequently spread northward into South America, Australia, and Africa...." Like Welty, Wallace and Mahan use the group selection argument without letting the reader know it. Thus (p. 326) the "presumed function" of eruptive dispersal in Bobwhites "is periodic reduction . . . of rapidly breeding herbivorous forms that might otherwise devegetate their range." One function of territo- riality is (p. 232) "assuring an even distribution of birds over available habitats, so that their carrying capacity is not exceeded." The section on structure and function does a good job with basic avian anatomy, but the physiology section is weak. For example, the discussion of thermoregulation makes no reference to temperature- metabolism curves, thermal neutral point, or the countercurrent exchange principle. An account of torpidity fails to define the phenomenon in physiological terms, nor is its adaptive value made clear. A short section on vocalizations makes no reference to the study of song dialects, or to the question of learned versus innate song components. In this review I have attempted to point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of three new editions of popular ornithology textbooks. All will make good reading for anyone interested in learning about the natural history of birds. Welty appears to have produced the best volume for a beginning ornithology class and for the general-interest reader who is interested but not experienced in avian anatomy, physiology, ecology, etc. With more extensive coverage of the literature, critical and careful use of the language of natural selection, and more thorough analysis of mathematical/theoretical aspects of evolutionary ecology, this book would graduate from very good to excellent. Advanced students and other researchers will find some parts of Van Tyne and Berger extremely valuable. For those topics adequately covered, this book provides superior access to the literature. Certainly it is the only one of the texts suitable for a survey course on birds of the world. It is most unfortunate that revision of Van Tyne and Berger did not include a distillation of the volumes edited by Farner and King. Other flaws are an uncritical and over-use of illustrative material, and inadequate treatment of ecology, physiology, and evolution.-CARL E. BOCK</page></plain_text>
