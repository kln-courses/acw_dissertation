<plain_text><page sequence="1">80 THE INDENOONA CONTACT SITE : A PRELIMINARY REPORT OF AN ENGRAVING SITE IN THE PILBARA REGION OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA Robert Reynolds INTRODUCTION In 1901 John Withnell privately published a small book entitled the Customs and Traditions of the Aboriginal Natives of North Western Australia. He opens his chapter on rock carvings with a statement that Aborigines 'have very many rock carvings, every hill that has suitable hard stone will have some figure tattooed thereon' (Withnell 1901:29). This paper is a preliminary report on one of the many hundreds of such sites located in the Roebourne area. It is typical in many ways; it makes use of a granophyre knoll, it is located next to a permanent pool, and both the pecking technique and style of the engraving are typical of the area. The site's significance lies in the choice of the motifs and in the date of their creation, for the engravings at this site are predominantly of subjects related to European occupation of the area. They include men on horseback, guns, cattle, steam-assisted sailing ships and a woman in a long skirt. It was the ships which caught the eye of David Daniels who first recorded the site during one of his site inspection trips conducted as part of the West Pilbara site documentation project, which is a project run by the local Aboriginal people and funded by the Australian Heritage Commission through the Western Australian Museum. The site is located 32 km southeast of the town of Roeboume in the east Pilbara, 25 km from the coast. The engravings are located at the northeast end of the granophyre knoll that rises some 20 m above a permanent pool on the Jones River. The river is one of the smaller water courses that run north to the sea along this stretch of coast. The suitability of the rock, the water and associated plant and animal resources are obviously significant factors influencing the choice of the site which had been used for a considerable time prior to European occupation.</page><page sequence="2">81 Figure 1.

SITE DESCRIPTION In contrast to other Pilbara sites with contact period art, the Indenoona site has a large number of figures which are clearly post contact. Out of a total of 84 motifs, 37 or 44% are of historical content compared with only 21 or 25% which are clearly of traditional character. Of the remaining 26, which do not fit clearly into either category, at least half appear from their context and direct association with contact engravings to fit into the post contact category. While motifs of European association clearly indicate a post contact date for those specific engravings, the reverse is not necessarily true and it is quite possible that many of the engravings which are traditional in style are contemporaneous with the post contact motifs or even post date some of them. The traditional motifs are limited to human and anthropomorphic figures including male figures with headdresses, radiating designs, animals, a number of meandering lines and boomerang-like shapes (Fig. 1). The ubiquitous kangaroo and emu prints so common to most Pilbara engraving sites are represented by only a single kangaroo print. A large fish, which might generally be interpreted as a traditional motif, is unusual in a site so far from the sea. The small number of engravings showing superimposition make it difficult to assess a relative time sequence with any certainty although a more detailed examination of the few examples where it does occur may shed further light on temporal associations. There is however, one clear example of a contact motif overlying a weathered engraving typical of the traditional style. As is usual in the Pilbara the vast majority of motifs at this site are produced by pecking. One figure, a traditional copulating couple, is abraded, while three other engravings (all post contact subjects) suggest a dual technique with secondary abrading being used after the basic design had been prepared by pecking. All subjects are drawn in a simple figurative style with solid infilled motifs. The majority of the figures are small with only four of the figures exceeding 50 cm in their largest dimension. The most common of the post contact motifs are men on horseback, fourteen of which are engraved at the site. Several of these occur not as individuals but as part of a composition with two or more figures - one chasing a cow and another as part of a group of figures which may possibly be interpreted as a hunting party and includes the woman in a long skirt. Another figure incorporated in a scene with multiple motifs is the man shooting at a creature which is difficult to identify, but may be a bird or a sheep (Fig. 2). Among other notable engravings are the two vehicles drawn by animals. One is drawn by a single, and the other by a pair of animals which may be either bullocks or horses (Fig. 3).</page><page sequence="4">83 Figure 3. Animal drawn vehicle (54cm x 35cm) Figure 4. Steam assisted sailing ship (43cm x 43cm). Note pennants and smoke from funnel blowing forwards</page><page sequence="5">84 There are also engravings of five ships. One appears to be a square rigged sailing ship. The other four have two masts with funnels belching smoke. Three of these appear to be square-riggers (Fig. 4), but the fourth, which is the most detailed, has an anchor, rudder and crew member, but no spars. At the base of the granophyre knoll with the engravings are the well preserved remains of a dry stone walled stockyard which in places rises to a height of 2.5 m (Fig. 5). The construction, style and workmanship are very similar to the shearing shed at Cooyapooya Station which is located some 30 km to the southwest of Indenoona and is known to have been built in the 1880s. Figure 5. Stockyard: detail of dry stone wall showing knapping Around the stockyard are numerous artefacts from the contact period including considerable amounts of worked glass. Amongst the formal tool types noted there were two adzes made from the thick bases of black-green glass bottles. Also noted at the site were the remains of clay pipes which it may be possible to date and by this means obtain a more accurate date with which the engravings themselves can be associated. There are also numerous stone flakes, but few of these show any secondary working and many clearly derive from the shaping of the blocks for the stockyard and associated building. While one would like to think that this stone work was done by Aboriginal people utilizing their traditional skills, the information available for Cooyapooya indicates that it is European workmanship and we are therefore probably dealing with stone artefacts made by Europeans.</page><page sequence="6">85 There are however, a small number of artefacts made from quartz. A more detailed examination of these and their context may establish whether they pre-date or are contemporaneous with the contact material. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Although there had been sporadic earlier exploration, the first extensive European investigation of the land was carried out by FT. Gregory's party in 1 861 and, prompted by his enthusiastic reports of the country, the first settlers arrived in the area in 1863. Indenoona Station, which was located at the site described in this paper, was formally leased by Samual Viveash in 1865. The foundations of the old homestead and a number of other out buildings survive across the river from the engraving site. Although many settlers brought Aboriginal prisoners from Rottnest Island to provide labour, they also soon started making use of the local inhabitants. It is interesting to note that right from the earliest stages of pastoral settlement sheep were the dominant stock, whereas the identifiable animals in the engravings are all cattle. Census figures for the Roebourne area in 1870 indicate that while there were 51 ,640 sheep, there were only 530 cattle, and these would include the bullocks used as draught animals. Cyclones and drought made the economic viability of the early pastoral stations doubtful and the survival of many depended on additional income derived from pearling out of Cossack. This was the main port for the area and was originally called Tien Tsin. In the early years of settlement most of the station owners ran small scale operations during the pastoral off season, and employed the Aboriginal station hands as divers. By 1 875 there were 493 Aborigines employed in the pearling industry at Cossack and by the 1883-84 season this had risen to 556. A recent survey of Cossack conducted by Pat Vinnicombe has located what is probably the Aboriginal camping area for the township. Together with stone artefacts there are artefacts manufactured from black-green glass identical to that found at Indenoona. By the late 1880s casual seasonal involvement in the pearling industry was largely replaced by full time operators for whom 'black birding' for divers was a common practice. It is tempting to suggest that the engraving of the man on a horse with other figures, at least one of which appears to be in chains, may be related to this period of enforced labour. One of the single human figures at Indenoona also appears to be in chains. However, few of the ships directly involved in pearling were steam ships, and while a number of steam ships including the 'Xantho' called into Cossack, the first regular steam service did not begin until 1 881 . However, further investigation of documentary sources may establish that ships which can be more closely identified with those shown in engravings, were working in the area during a precisely dated time span.</page><page sequence="7">86 Considerable familiarity with ships seems to be indicated by the details in the engravings, particularly the variation which shows pennants and smoke flowing in some cases in the direction the ship is facing, and in others blowing in the opposite direction (Fig. 4). Other details such as the accuracy of the anchor also imply a detailed knowledge of ships and shipping. OTHER CONTACT ART Elsewhere in the Pilbara, art of the contact period, or at least art using post contact motifs, is rare and is usually limited to isolated motifs or at most very small groups. These include a man on horseback and a series of hoof prints and two engravings of horses at Woodstock. Of the two horses which occur on the one panel, only one is shown in Wright's book on Pilbara art published in 1968 and it would seem that the upper of these two figures may have been added since then. In that case it may well be of European origin. The clearly defined engraving of 'The Saint' at Turtle Pool near Tom Price almost certainly falls into this category, and is immediately termed graffiti. Engravings which seem more likely to be of Aboriginal origin occur on Pilga station, 130 km west of Indenoona. Here there is a horse's head and what appear to be wheels in an inverted drawing of the poppet-head of the nearby mine. Also relevant to this paper are the well known paintings of ships in other parts of Western Australia. However, the ship at Walga Rock near Cue 750 km south of the Indenoona site is again quite possibly not of Aboriginal origin. On Bigge Island in the Kimberleys paintings of a sailing ship and a rowing boat have been recorded. Crawford has suggested that these could relate to the visit of the Dutch navigator Tasman in 1644. Whether it was this or a later party of visiting Europeans that is recorded, the Aboriginal authorship of these paintings is not in doubt (Crawford 1968:76-80). ABORIGINAL ORIGIN If some of the recorded post contact art of the Pilbara is possibly not of Aboriginal origin, the authorship of the Indenoona site may also be questioned. Located near the top of the knoll are the engraved initials 'S.E.M.' which are patinated to a degree similar to much of the pictorial subject matter and it seems probable that the initials are European. Further documentary research may be able to establish a station owner or hand with these initials and this might also help in dating the site. In view of the initials, it is possible that some of the engravings may have been made by European stockmen, possibly even in association with Aboriginal people and certainly having followed their techniques. However, the existence of a number of traditional figures where patinatbn appears to indicate considerably greater age than the contact motifs, and the continuation of the use of traditional figures found in association with the contact motifs, would imply a continuing tradition of Aboriginal art.</page><page sequence="8">87 The traditional techniques used and style reflected in some of the contact motifs wou Id support this, and on the present evidence I believe there is little doubt that they are Aboriginal. One further piece of evidence to support Aboriginal authorship is the presence of the glass adzes which show traditional activities continuing among the Aboriginal population in the post contact times. CONCLUSION The Indenoona site is a fascinating and, as far as we know, the most extensive record of the early interaction of traditional Aboriginal people and the European settlers who occupied their land. As such it is also one of the few records of this interface between the two cultures to be presented by the Aboriginal people which is available to us today. I believe further investigation of the Indenoona site will be a rewarding study. REFERENCES Clark, J. 1978 Rock art conservation: a review of a research project, December 1973 to December 1978.
