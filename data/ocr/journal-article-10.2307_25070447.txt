<plain_text><page sequence="1">11 THE EXEGETICAL TRADITIONS OF PURITAN TYPOLOGY Only recently have students of New England Puritanism focused upon the Puritan's widespread interest in typology. When noticed at all, typology has been generally viewed as an aspect of the regrettable Puritan flirtation with allegory, and, as such, has been seen as a naive and inhibiting characteristic of an already rigidly limited aesthetic. Several recent studies, however, have called attention to the relationship of typology to the Puritan view of history, to the covenantal structure of the New England theocracy, and to the basically analogic character of the Puritan poetic, demonstrating that an understanding of typology is central to reading Puritan texts and to identifying the references of Puritan imagery.1 As recent studies have also indicated, the type-antitype construct is far more complex than at first appears, and that to be unaware of typological traditions is to distort basic Puritan beliefs. Several critics, for example, have suggested that the taint of unorthodoxy hovers about the "Meditations" of Edward Taylor, in part because the poems are "quite literally redolent of altar incense" and the images of the "altar censer, incense, and offerings" evoke a "curiously Catholic response." Such imagery is, of course, not at all "strange ... in a Puritan context," for the references are to the typological significance of Hebrew ceremonial ritual. Such imagery appears in discussions of typology from the Epistle to the Hebrews to John Calvin, and is standard fare in such typological studies as Thomas Taylor's Moses and Aaron, or the Types and Shadows and Samuel Mather's The Figures or Types. Nor is the Puritan preoccupation with typology simply a seventeenth-century phenomenon. The roots of the Puritan practice of typological exegesis are deep in the traditions of the Church Fathers. Neither were the "great Protestant Reformers . . . explicit in their condemnation; of the typological method."3 The Reformers were, in fact, among the most earnest practitioners of typology, and the Puritan practice is clearly based on Reformational precedent. Even though the "establishment of historical connexions between</page><page sequence="2">12 certain events, persons or things in the Old Testament [the type] and similar events, persons or things in the New Testament [the antitype]"^ may have lead to the regrettable excesses (from the Puritan point of view, at any rate) of Catholic exegetes, the Puritan experiment in New England and the most central points of its theology were based too fully on the Old Testament to discard a traditional method of exegesis which provided impeccable biblical authority for the New England Way. From John Cotton's slightly unwarranted application of typical symbolism to New England events to Jonathan Edwards' adaptation of the analogic character of typology to his imagistic views of nature, the structure of the type-antitype construct pervades nearly all aspects of Puritan thought. The purpose of this paper, then, is to trace tie development of fie principles,of typological exegesis from the New Testament through the early Greek and Latin Fathers to the works of Tyndale, Luther, and Calvin, indica ting the complexity of the exegetical traditions which inform Puritan typology. Typology proper begins with the work of the authors of the New Testament books. As with much of Christian thought, however, certain Jewish and Greek traditions contributed to the framework of the typological approach. Until the fourth century,there was no clearly established New Testament canon; "scripture" meant the Old Testament, particularly the Greek version, the Septuagint. The development of any typology meant, then, that the identification of the type depended upon Hebrew Scripture and the Messianic traditions of prophecy. One of the major characteristics of the numerous rabbinical commentaries was the futuristic character of Messianic prophecy. A new Messiah would come; there would be a new and eternal House of God, superior to Solomon's Temple; there would be a new Exodus, a new Jerusalem, a new and eternal covenant, and the final deliverance of God's people from their enemies. For the early Christian ministers and the authors of the New Testament, ready at hand lay a Jewish method of interpretation which implied that an historical event would find its fulfillment in the future, a "greater than David would come." Such visionary dreams of the glorious age of a New Israel were also a part of Jewish liturgical materials, in addition to the traditions of</page><page sequence="3">13 prophecy,further extending the habit of mind which saw history as a series of integrated steps culminating in a grand, triumphant design. In addition to the traditions of prophecy and liturgy, Jewish and Hellenistic allegorical habits also contributed to the development of typological exegesis. Homeric studies of pagan texts had introduced an allegorical method of reading certain passages in the epics which scholars felt were unworthy of Homer, or which required allegorical readings to discover their true meanings. Hermeneuticists are generally agreed that Alexandrian Jews adopted many of the pagan techniques in their exposition of unclear or immoral passages of the Hebrew Scriptures. The leading Jewish scholar whose allegorical interpretations most influenced the subsequent tradition of Christian exegesis was Philo of Alexandria (ca 20 B.C.-40 A.D.), who represents the culmination of these traditions in Jewish thought.^ Typology in the canonical authors of the New Testament is relatively limited in scope; Philo influenced none of the New Testament writers, except perhaps the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.* But through the influence which he had on Origen, and Origen's subsequent authority in medieval exegesis, PhiIonian allegory was extended throughout the Middle Ages. What had originally been a method of explaining unclear passages, justifying anthropomorphic descriptions of God, and relieving scripture of the charges of immorality in a relatively few places, Philo applies indiscriminately to all of scripture. He did not deny that scripture had a literal and historical meaning; occasionally his commentary on specific passages begins with an exposition of the literal meaning of the text, using a standard formula to indicate the movement to an allegorical reading: "This is the literal meaning. But as, for the deeper meaning. ..." The literal meaning is not unrelated to the allegorical meaning, but, as Philo commonly phrases it, only as the body is related to the soul, or the shadow of truth to the reality. But "Philo does not . . . wait for the text to present obstacles to literal interpretation, or suggestions at a hidden meaning before he allegorizes it."? Individuals in the Old Testa ment are taken as personifications of abstractions?Moses is</page><page sequence="4">14 intelligence, Aaron speech, Enoch repentance, Noah righteous ness, Abraham is virtue acquired by learning, and so on. Philo's discussion of the "deeper meaning" of the furniture of Solomon's Temple indicates his allegorical methods. The Temple Court,he notes, represents"the objects of sense. . . , the Sanctuary, the objects of thought. . . . The five pillars of the porch indicate the senses which have relations both outwards and inwards. The fourfold fabric of the veil [indicates] the four elements, and . . . the seven lamps of the Candlestick . . . the planets with the Sun in the midst."8 In essence, Philo's methods discard the historical context of the Scripture, focusing upon the "under-senses" of the text. Philo notes, for example, that there was "probably ... an actual man called Samuel; but we conceive of the Samuel of the scripture, not as a living compound . . . , but as a mind which rejoices in the service and worship of God and that only."9 As Beryl Smalley comments: "The abstraction which Samuel signifies is more real . . . than the historical Samuel"; in Philo's approach to scripture, "the distinction between reality and imagery is melted" (p. 3). Although many of Philo's allegorical interpretations are incorporated in the allegorical readings of the Church Fathers, he is not a typologist. Even the limited "typology" of the Jewish traditions of Messianic prophecy has only a minor place in Philo's approach to the Hebrew Scriptures. Moreover, his allegorical readings are "essentially distinct from Christian typology, which always implies that the two events, promise and fulfillment, have taken place in time as real, historical facts."10 Yet, Philo's "two-level" approach to scripture was adopted by the earliest Christian apolo gists; further, Philonic allegory, combined with Alexandrian principles of exegesis, dominated Patristic interpretations for over 1000 years. Although there were several Fathers (Diodorus, Theodore, Chrysostom, and others) who denounced the allegorical methods of Philo?and Origen?and insisted on a literal reading of scripture, by the end of the fifth cen tury, allegorical exegesis dominated Patristic hermeneutics. Philo's significance to the early development of typology, however, is best seen in relation to the typology of the New Testament authors. Typology occupies a relatively</page><page sequence="5">15 limited place in the New Testament because the primary con cern of the canonical authors is Christological: it is the acts and person of Christ which provide the substance of their message, and typology is only of secondary importance. Christ's own references to his typological significance are few and occur mostly in Matthew, the Gospel most clearly designed to appeal to Jewish readers. In Matthew 12: 40, for example, Christ says: "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." In the same context, he refers to Solomon, saying "a greater than Solomon is here." In addition to the specific parallels which Christ draws, Matthew characterizes Christ as fulfilling certain promises of the Old Testament; the infant Jesus, for example, is taken to Egypt so that the prophecy of Hosea,M0ut of Egypt I have called my son," might be fulfilled. Neither Mark nor Luke refers explicitly to Christ's fulfillment of Old Testa ment prophecies, and in John's Gospel, only one mention is made of Christ's typological significance: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up . . ." (3: 14). Although the term typos is not used, by associating the person and work of Jesus with events and persons in the Old Testament, Matthew and John represent an intermediate stage between the prophecies of the Old Testament and the fuller typological readings of St. Paul and the author of Hebrews. St. Paul uses various terms to describe the typological event: in Galatians 4: 22-24, for example, he interprets the fact that Abraham had two wives as an allegoroumena of the two covenants; in I Corinthians 10: 11, he refers to certain events in the Old Testament as skia or "shadows" of the reality that came in Christ. In the same context, however, Paul first uses the term which indicates an event which adumbrates another event?typos : ... I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And did all eat the same spiritual meat;</page><page sequence="6">16 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that follow ed them: and that Rock was Christ. . . . Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples [typoi]; and they are written for our admonition, . . . (1-4, 11) He also uses the same term in Romans 5: 14 with the same meaning: "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses . . . who is the figure [typos] of him that was to come." But the New Testament writer who assigns the most importance to typological interpretation is the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. In fact, the Epistle is founded upon typology, for the writer's purpose is to demonstrate to a Jewish audience that the men and institutions of the Old Covenant have been excelled and abolished by the New. The terminology is not consistent, using skia, hypodeigma (pattern),parabole, as well as typos to describe the historical event in the Old Testament, although, as the context makes clear, the various terms are synonymous. Although the references to typology in the gospels and epistles indicate that the terminology for describing the typical event has not been completely established, the basic concepts of typology are clearly illustrated. Writing before there is any New Testament canon, the authors view the Old Testament in the light of divine history. The Hebrew Scrip tures, they believe, are not simply the sacred books of the Jewish people, and, as such, to be read in reference to that faith alone; they are the records of God's dealings with his people, and in these relationships, the advent of his divine Son is foreshadowed. To the New Testament authors, typologi cal exegesis is a method of reading history; it is centrally rooted in history itself. Even in the limited typological exegesis of New Testament authors, however, are the seeds of a more individualistic approach to scripture; for, divorced from the literal sense and modified by the allegorical methods of Philo and hermeneutic principles of Origen, the typology of Old Testament history is transformed into the relatively subjective allegorical interpretations of Origen and the Alexandrian school of exegetes. ^~ The fact that "Origen divided the interpretation of</page><page sequence="7">17 Scripture into three senses is almost as well known as the fact that Caesar divided Gaul into three parts." 12 Origen does not deny that there is a literal sense of scripture;like Philo,however, Origen rarely comments upon the literal level. He asserts that there are three "graduated" (teleois) levels; of these the literal is the least important. In connection with his extensive production of Homilies, Origen develops a second, higher level of interpretation which he calls "moral" exegesis. And finally, for those who have been endowed by God with a special gift of grace, there is a "spiritual" or "mystical" level. Origen supports his threefold schema with citations from the New Testament. In II Corinthians 3: 6,for example, Paul writes that "the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life"; in Ephesians 5: 32, he speaks of Christ's relation to the church as a bridegroom's relation to his bride, and declares that this is a "great mystery." In addition, Origen frequently cites Proverbs 22: 20, where the mistranslated verse in the Septuagint, "Have I not written unto thee a triple way?", implies a threefold scriptural signification.13 In addition to adducing scripture to vali date his textual approach, Origen, directly influenced by Philo's tripartite division of man into body, soul,and spirit (which Philo acquired from the Neo-Platonism of the Alexan drian interpreters), accepts the Greek concept of the faculties as a testimony from the Hellenistic traditions to the legitimacy of a multi-level reading of scripture. In the Homily on Leviticus, for example, Origen comments: The words of Scripture should be printed in the soul in one of three ways. The uneducated should be edi fied by the letter itself, by what we call the obvious meaning. People at a higher level should find edifi cation for their souls. The perfect should be edified by the spiritual Law, as it contains the shadow of the blessings to come. Man is composed of body, soul and spirit, and the structure of Scripture has been plan ned by God for man's salvation in the same way.^ It would be incorrect to say that Origen completely abandons traditional Christian typology in developing the moral and spiritual levels of interpretation; remnants of the kind of typology practiced by the canonical authors are</page><page sequence="8">18 retained in numerous exegetical passages. But in his Commentary on John, and in other passages as well,Origen asserts that with the coming of Christ, types had been done away with; though they still might foster the faith of the beginning Christian, they had in fact lost their significance to the mature believer. Given this assumption, as Hansen notes, it is quite simple for Origen to ignore the "fairly broad and recognizable path of traditional Christian typology . . . [and] indulge in an allegory of a basically Philonic, Hellenistic" character (p. 253). Origen's threefold level of interpretation and his subordination of the typology of the New Testament to his bent for allegory can best be illustrated by one of the earliest baptismal type-antitype identifications. In I Peter 3: 20-21, Noah's sojourn in the ark is identified as a type of Christian baptism: "... God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein [a] few . . . were saved by water. . . . The like typos whereunto even baptism doth also now save us. . . ." Because the gnostics, partic ularly Khe disciples of Marcion,had questioned the credibility of the Noah account, Origen is forced to defend the histo ricity of the text more fully than he ordinarily does. The story of the ark is, Origen asserts, literally true; there was a real ark which did once float upon the waters. But he immediately adds that the "truer" meaning of the account lies in its spiritual import: ". . .we call upon him who alone can lift the veil in our reading of the Old Testament, [and] we will try to see what this building of the ark contains for our spiritual profit."15 Allegorically speaking, Origen notes, the Flood "is an image of the true and final end of this world"; as Noah was instructed to bring into the ark various animals, so the true Noah, "Our Lord Jesus Christ, is told by his Father ... to construct an ark of measure ment full of heavenly sacramentis" (pp. 105-106), and to people it with "those who are saved through the Church." Because the animals were divided among the various compart ments, thus signifying various degrees of perfection, "this shows that in the Church also, though all share the same faith and are washed by the same baptism, all do not equally advance and each one remains in his own class" (p. 107). In interpreting the extended description of the measurements of</page><page sequence="9">19 the ark, Origen moves beyond the relatively simple moral lessons which dominate the first part of his analysis. One example will suffice to indicate the tenor of this rather lengthy passage. The length of the ark was 300 cubits, unit ing, according to Origen, the mystical numbers of 100 and three. The number 100 indicates fullness and contains the mystery of the totality of the Spiritual creation, as we read in the Gospel, when it is said that a man have a hundred sheep and losing one of them left the ninety-nine others and went to seek the lost one. . . . [However,] this "hundredth," the fullness of Spiritual creation, does not subsist of itself, but proceeds from the Trinity and receives from the Father, through the Son and Holy Spirit, the length of life, that is the grace of immortality; it is because of this multiplied by three, so that having fallen from "hundred" through ignorance, it is restored in the three hundred by the knowledge of the Trinity (p. 109). Origen further interprets the remaining dimensions of the ark and labels his analysis a penetration of the "mystical" sense. "The ark," he asserts, "is the faithful soul. It should be coated with bitumen within and without, that is, perfect in knowledge and works." The "clean" animals are "memory, culture, understanding, reflexion and judgement upon what we read"; the "unclean" animals are "desire and anger" (p. 110). Further, the clean animals also signify the seven powers of the soul (the five senses, speech, and the generative faculty); the unclean animals are the ill uses that man can make of the powers of the soul. Even though a typological identification provides the point of departure for Origen's interpretation, this is not typology. "The type exists in history and is factual," as Perry Miller notes in another context. "By contrast, the allegory, the simile, the metaphor have been made according to the fancy of men, and they mean whatever the brain of the begetter is pleased they should mean."16 Or, as Samuel Mather puts it: "It is not safe for Men to form Allegories out of their own Fancies. . . ."17 Yet, in Origen's use of</page><page sequence="10">20 the typical event, the framework for future expositors is established; the "typology" of Origen is the typology of the Latin Fathers, with relatively few modifications, from Augustine to Aquinas: "to write a history of Origenist influence on the west," Miss Smalley notes, "would be tanta mount to writing a history of western exegesis" (p. 14). Types continue to appear, of course, in the works of succeed ing commentators, particularly in relation to the literal sense. In general, however, the typological reading is allotted only a minor role in such exegesis; further, when related to the "higher" senses of scripture, it is ordinarily subordinated to the "spiritual" interpretation or so completely absorbed in it, that, in fact, typology ceases to exist, in the historical New Testament pattern at any rate. In his interpretation of the Flood, Origen touches on one aspect ("an image of the . . . final end of this world") which, although not developed, anticipates the fourth level of interpretation which will be partially systematized 150 years later by St. Jerome and St. Augustine, and codified in the fifth century by John Cassian: "anagogical." Although not too systematic, Jerome generally adopts Origen's three fold division, citing the same texts which Origen uses to support the threefold approach. Yet Jerome makes two changes in Origen's system. First, Jerome introduces the term tropologiam which had been used by Origen about allegorical and typological interpretation in general; with Jerome it assumes the exclusive meaning of moral signification. More over, in the Second Commentary on Amos Jerome introduces an additional level of meaning which was to assume later the restricted meaning of anagogical: "We must interpret the sacred Scriptures first, according to the letter . . . , according to allegory . . . , [and] according to the bliss of things to come."IS The eschatological implications of the "bliss of things to come" anticipates, as does Origen's interpretation of the Flood as an image of the end of the world, the anagogical level of interpretation. Jerome's influence on typological exegesis was slight; for from Origen he inherited a fairly well established tradition which had already assigned typology to a minor role in scriptural interpretation. Further, as Wolfson makes clear, "Jerome believed that with the coming of Christ only the moral</page><page sequence="11">21 commands of the Old Testament . . . were still to be obeyed . . ." (p. 67). Hence, in many cases the type-antitype construct testified only to the predictive character of the Old Testament; it might also be related to the moral and allegorical senses, but only occasionally, and then peripher ally. Augustine was even less systematic in his exegesis than Jerome, although Augustine is often mistakenly identified as the exclusive author of the fourfold sense of interpre tation. Augustine "favours fourfold classifications of various kinds."^ In several instances, he speaks of a four fold method identical to the one Jerome presents in the Second Commentary on Amos; in De Utilitate Credendi, however, Augustine says that "all Scripture . . .is handed down fourfold . . . ,according to history, according to aetiology, according to analogy, [and] according to allegory."20 And in De Vera Religione, as Wolfson notes, Augustine enumerates, in addition to the literal sense, four kinds of allegory: the allegory of history(historiae),the allegory of facts (facti), the allegory of discourse (sermonis), and the allegory of rites (sacramenti) (p. 69). Erich Auerbach is misleading when he asserts that Augustine "emphatically rejected the purely allegorical interpretation of the Holy Scriptures and dismissed the notion that the Old Testament was a kind of hermetic book that became intelligible only if one discarded the literal historical meaning. . . ."21 Augustine did insist on the historicity of the literal text: Before all things, brethren, we admonish and command you in the name of the Lord, that when you hear an exposition of the mystery of the Scriptures telling of things that took place, you believe what is read to have actually taken place as the reading narrates; lest, undermining the foundation of actuality, you seek as it were to build in the air.22 Yet, Augustine's insistence, taken within the context of his debt to Origen and Jerome, and within the context of his own description of the differing allegorical senses, is not as emphatic as Auerbach implies. Moreover, Augustine's practice indicates that any passage which does not, from</page><page sequence="12">22 his point of view, measure up to the requirements of the Faith, can be interpreted according to a "deeper" meaning. In trying to explain the various immoral episodes in Samon's life, for example, Augustine, following Origen and Jerome, discards the literal meaning of the text. Samson lied to his friends;he also lay with a harlot. Such actions are hard to reconcile with Samson's role as a pr?figuration of Christ. Augustine notes, however, that "the justice of this man lies hidden in the depths." Since it is written that "he submitted to the charms of women and that he went to a harlot, his righteousness must indeed appear dubious to those who are onlY partially aware of the secrets of the truth."23Augustine then discards the literal sense, using a standard formula which he commonly applies in such cases: "We can say that in the Old Testament such things were neither criminal nor worthy of censure, for whatever was done or said was prophecy." Augustine's exegetical principles are directly traceable to Jerome as his are traceable to Origen. In the light of previous typological identifications, Augustine's Contra Faus turn and his various incidental typological interpretations are largely a summary of the statements of previous exegetes. Although the fourfold system generally governs Augustine's exegesis, the system which dominated the next 1000 years of biblical exegesis was not formalized by either Jerome or Augustine. John Cassian is apparently the first Patristic commentator to append to the work of Jerome and Augustine a complete terminology. The first sense he [Cassian] terms historia, employing an expression which had been used in reference to the literal sense ever since Origen. The second, the moral sense, which had already been discerned by Origen, Cassian calls tropolog?a, using a term that was given this signification by Jerome. The third sense ... is called allegoria by Cassian, who in this follows the example of Jerome. Finally, the fourth sense is that which refers to eternal things. It had first been discerned by Origen, and later by Jerome. Now Cassian gives it its own name, that of anagoge.24 In a climate such as this, the relatively limited use of the</page><page sequence="13">23 typology of the New Testament could not flourish as a distinct means of exegesis; types became so completely subordinated to the more spiritual levels of interpretation that the basic distinctions between typology and allegory were no longer observed. In its general framework, then, the principles of typological exegesis reflected in Augustine are those of the Middle Ages. It should be noted, however, that a number of early Church Fathers were quite displeased?as the Puritans were later to be?with the allegorical interpretations associated with Origen and the School of Alexandria. In the first decade of the fourth century, the "school" at Antioch was "founded ... in direct opposition to the excesses and fantasies of the allegorical method of Origen. . . ."25 st. Basil, called the "Father of Orthodoxy," was a member of the Council which condemned Origen as an heretic; he makes clear in his commentaries on Genesis, In Hexameron, that allegory has no place in scriptural interpretation: I know the laws of allegory, though not from my own works but the works of others. Some preachers do not concede the ordinary sense of the Scriptures. They will not call water water, but something else. They interpret a plant or fish as their fancy wishes. They change the nature of the reptiles and wild beasts to fit their allegories, like those who explain . . . dreams to suit their own ends. When I hear the word grass, I understand that grass is meant. ? Such Fathers as Basil, Cyril of Jerusalem, Eusebius, Chryso stom, and others insist upon the historicity of the Old Testament and the necessity of avoiding allegorical"fancies," focusing instead on the literal and typological meaning of the text. Chrysostorn, the last major exponent of the Antio chene principles, attempted to establish general principles of typological exegesis which would combat the extravagances of Alexandrian allegory. Because all commentators after Christ are dn possession of the "reality," Chrysostom insists that there is the temptation to read into the type the full details which can only be ascertained by a knowledge of the antitype. But the type, he asserts, does not possess "all</page><page sequence="14">24 the exactness of the reality";*' ignoring this principle, he argues, leads to the exegetical subjectivism of Alexandrian allegory. The conflict between the exegetical schools of Antioch and Alexandria was resolved in the fifth century, for the two schools could not long exist together. Although there was broad agreement on certain aspects of traditional exegesis, the proponents of the different schools were themselves con vinced of an irreconcilable contradiction in their approaches: At Antioch the object was to find in Holy Writ its most obvious meaning; at . . . Alexandria the search was for figures of Christ. The one side accused alle gory of destroying the value of the Bible. . . , of travestying it into mythological fable; the other dubbed "carnal" all who clung to the letter. . . . Origen discovers types not just in certain episodes, but in every detail of the inspired words. Each line is filled with mystery. On the other hand Antioch made it a fundamental principle to see figures of Christ just occasionally, not always, in the Old Tes tament. . . . Types were the exception, not the rule; the Incarnation was everywhere prepared, but not every where prefigured.?? The development of the fourfold levels of interpretation presupposed a much broader approach than the Antiochenes could accept. Further, allegory encouraged the tendency for exegesis to be used as a support for dogma. Church Tradition was gradually being formed in the third and fourth centuries, based in large part on the sacramenti of the Bible; and the rationalistic tendencies of the Antiochenes were directly opposed to its development. Two individuals ultimately contributed to the disrepute of the School of Antioch. One of the first pupils of Lucian, one of the founders of the school, was Arius. The rationalistic tendencies of the school, exaggerated in Arius' teaching, led to the disapproval of the Church councils, and, in the Council of Nicaea, to the designation of Arianism as heresy. The second person was Augustine.</page><page sequence="15">25 Augustine viewed himself as a reconciler between the two traditions; as a matter of fact, however, his exegetical principals predisposed him to the Origenistic approach and his actual practice demonstrates his commitment to it. In The City of God, Augustine appears to support a position which would encompass the principles of both schools: No one ought to suppose . . . that these things were written for no purpose, or that we should study only the historical truth, apart from any allegorical meanings; or, on the contrary, that there are only allegories, and that there were no such facts at all, or that, whether it be so or no, there is here no prophecy of the church. His next sentence, however, indicates that the real signifi cance of scripture lies beyond "bare historical facts": For what right-minded man will contend that books so religiously preserved during thousands of years, and transmitted by so orderly a succession, were written without an object, or that only the bare historical facts are to be considered when we read them.29 The purpose for which scripture was written, the object which underlies it, is the indication of the "prophecy of the church." In "On Christian Doctrine," Augustine again returns to the same point: When what is said figuratively is taken as if it were said literally, it is understood in a carnal manner. And nothing is more fittingly called the death of the soul than when that in it which raises it above the brutes, the intelligence, namely, is put in subjection to the flesh by a blind adherence to the letter.30 Such a principle is, as Chrysostom makes clear, inimical to typology, for the relatively disparaging attitude toward the literal sense provides less precise exegetes an open license for subjective interpretation. It is true that Augustine insisted that allegorical readings should be based on the</page><page sequence="16">26 literal sense; but when it "came to practical application, he was swayed by the thought of his times. ... He often went too far, almost to the point of panallegorism."31 in the process, as in Jerome and Origen's practice, typology is identified with a "blind adherence to the letter," and is subordinated to more "spiritual readings" so much as to become a very minor mode of exegesis. Auerbach is incorrect when he asserts that "the only reason [typos] fell behind figura is that it was a foreign word" (p. 48). Typos is the term invariably used in the interpretations of the school of Antioch, for its connotations were those of the koine Greek of the New Testament. Figura (the term which Augustine nor mally uses), as Auerbach correctly observes, "more or less consciously evoked all the notions involved in its [classical] history" (p. 48). One of the "notions" the term evokes is Greek allegorism, and subsequently the allegory of Philo, Origen, Jerome, and Augustine. Allegorical readings, based on Alexandrian precepts, dominate medieval exegesis. Ordinarily, the type provides only the original identification and has little relationship to the extensive allegorical interpretations; before Protestant typology could develop, therefore,it was necessary to re-establish the primacy of the literal sense, eliminating the accrued interpretations of Patristic allegory which had become a major part of Church Tradition. The rehabilitation of New Testament typology was, perhaps, only a by-product of the more central concerns of the Reformation. Yet, when the Reformers denied the validity of the Church and its Councils, when they insisted on a faith founded upon Scriptura sacra alone, and when the vernacular translations of the Bible which were deemed necessary to the Protestant cause led exegetes back to the original Greek and Hebrew texts, it was inevitable that typological exegesis would find its way into the Reformers' treatises. Moreover, once the distinction between typology and Alexandrian allegory had been re-estab lished, for a brief time typology became almost as important a method of biblical exegesis as medieval allegory had been to the Scholastics. In assessing the role which typology plays in the works of the Reformers, Perry Miller asserts that "the great</page><page sequence="17">27 Protestant reformers had been very explicit in the con demnation of the typological method along with every other variant of the allegorical." Moreover, he continues, "the English Reformers . . . were furiously hostile to all typological speculations." As an example of this "hostility," Miller cites Tyndalels statement in The Ob ?dieiice of a Chris tiaii Man : "Such allegory proveth nothing, it is a mere simile. God is a Spirit, and all His words are spiritual, and his literal sense is spiritual."32 Miller's statements are incorrect and his citation of what he takes to be Tyndale's exegetical principles is misleading; for unlike Miller, Tyndale clearly distinguishes between Patristic allegory and typology,accept ing the typology of the New Testament, and recognizing the use of allegory in the Scriptures themselves and in the interpretation of certain passages. Moreover, these distinc tions occur in the same context as Miller's citation, as well as in Tyndale's numerous prefaces to his translations and in other essays. By the fifteenth century, from Tyndale's point of view, the allegorizing of the Fathers as represented in the glosses had obscured and distorted the scriptural text: The greatest cause of . . . captivity and the decay of the faith, and this blindness wherein we now are, sprang first of allegories. Origen and the doctors of his time drew all the scripture unto allegories: whose ensample they that came after followed so long, till they at last forgot the order and process of the text, supposing that the scripture served but to feign allegories upon; insomuch that twenty doctors expound one text twenty ways. . . . Then came our sophisters with their anagogical and chopological sense, and with an antitheme of half an inch, out of which some of them draw a thread of nine days long (p. 343). In contrast to indiscriminate allegorizing, Tyndale insists that because "allegories prove nothing . . . they are to be used soberly and seldom, and only where the text offereth thee an allegory" (p. 343). As he make quite clear, allegories divorced from the literal sense do not prove any thing; when they are justified by the literal sense,however, when allegories alone are not presented as a sole basis for doctrinal proof, then "doth the literal sense prove the</page><page sequence="18">28 allegory, and bear it, as the foundation beareth a house" (p. 343). Therefore, all interpretations?including typological and allegorical?must arise from the literal sense and be proved by it. Tyndale does not attack allegory per se; he attacks the allegorizing of the Church Fathers which discards the literal sense in favor of a spiritual reading. Neither in The Obedience itself, from which Miller quotes, nor in any other work does Tyndale condemn allegory itself, but the use to which allegory had been put in the interpretations of the Church Fathers; moreover, his condemnations invariably appear in relation to the glossia in general or to some specific interpreter. 3 And it is in The Obedience that Tyndale makes clear that allegories and "similitudes" are to be used when "we preach, [or] when we expound the scripture." Only the literal text may be used as doctrinal proof, but figurative language leads to a clearer understanding of the literal sense: . . . similitudes prove nothing, but are made to express more plainly that which is contained in scripture, and to lead thee into the spiritual understanding of the text: as the similitude of matrimony is taken to express the marriage that is between Christ and our souls, and what exceeding mercy we have there, whereof all the scriptures make mention. . . . That preacher therefore, that bringeth a naked similitude to prove that which is contained in no text of scripture, nor followeth of a text, count a deceiver ... (p. 348). Yet Tyndale clearly distinguishes between the allegories of men and those contained in the Scripture; to understand scriptural allegories is to understand the literal sense even though it is phrased in figurative language: Though shalt understand . . . that the scripture hath but one sense, which is the literal. And that literal sense is the root and ground of all, and the anchor that never faileth, whereunto if thou cleave,</page><page sequence="19">29 thou canst never err or go out of the way. And if thou leave the literal sense, thou canst not but go out of the way. Neverthelater litalics added], the scripture useth proverbs, similitudes, riddles, or allegories, as all other speeches do; but that which the proverb, similitude, riddle, or allegory signifieth, is ever the literal sense, which thou must seek out diligently . . . (p. 340). Tyndale's position is generally the position of Luther and Calvin?and the Puritans: Alexandrian allegorical inter pretations are the "fancies" of men; some texts, however, necessitate an allegorical reading; although figurative, allegory elucidates the literal sense; moreover, scripture itself utilizes similitudes and allegories to clarify the literal sense. And in Tyndale's work,"types" are similitudes. Neither in his translations nor in the prefaces added later does Tyndale use the term typos nor any of its cognates; because of the excesses of medieval allegory it seems clear that Tyndale wished to avoid any of the medieval connotations associated with a theory of types. In contrasting the promises of the Old Law with its fulfillment in Christ, he uses the awkward term "fore-rehearsed" to express the typical relationship between the testaments.34 xn "a Pathway into the Holy Scripture" he also uses the phrase "promises rehearsed" in a typological sense: When Christ is thuswise preached, and the promises rehearsed, which are contained in the prophets, in the psalms, and in divers places of the five books of Moses . . . , then the hearts of them which are elect and chosen begin to wax soft and melt at the bounteous mercy of God ... (p. 15). In the "Prologue to the Book of Leviticus," however, Tyndale is more direct: he explains that the rites and ceremonies of the Hebrew faith are "shadows" of the promises fulfilled in Christ; moreover, he makes explicit that these promises are expressed in "allegories, similitudes, or examples": . . . though sacrifices and ceremonies can be no ground</page><page sequence="20">30 or foundation to build upon; that is, though we can prove nought with them, yet when once we have found out Christ and his mysteries, then we may borrow figures, that is to say allegories, similitudes, or examples, to open Christ, and the secrets of God hid in Christ. . . . For simili tudes have more virtue and power with them than bare words, and lead a man's wits farther into the pith and marrow and spiritual understanding of the thing, than all the words that can be imagined (p. 60). In relation to the pr?figurations of Christ in the Old Testament,Tyndale makes clear that "similitudes" or "examples" (the two terms he uses in his translations as a substitute for typos) lead one further into the "marrow of sacred divinity" than "bare words" alone. Although some types are unclear in their meaning and only "shadow forth" Christ, some are as clear as the "light of broad day": . . . all the ceremonies and sacrifices have, as it were, a star-light of Christ, yet some there be that have, as it were, the light of the broad day . . . and express him, and the virtue of his death so plainly, as if we should play his passion on a scaffold, or in a stage-play, openly before the eyes of the people; as the scape-goat, the brasen serpent, the ox burnt without the host, the passover lamb, &amp;c: insomuch that I am fully persuaded, and cannot but believe, that God had shewed Moses the secrets of Christ, and the very manner of his death beforehand. . . . And I believe also that the prophets, which followed Moses to confirm his prophecies, and to maintain his doctrine unto Christ's coming, were moved by such things to search farther of Christ's secrets . . . (p. 60). The scapegoat, brazen serpent, sacrificial ox and lamb are, of course, traditional typological identifications of the Passion; as such, they testify the typological unity of the two testaments,and to the necessity of setting the "promises rehearsed" before the eyes of the people. Such type-antitype identifications are not unusual in Tyndale's writing, par ticularly when one recognizes that he often uses the term "ensample" as a substitute for type.^5</page><page sequence="21">31 Luther's use of typology?and allegory?is far more extensive than Tyndale's,36 an?l bJLs discussion of his early predilection for allegorical readings indicates how deeply embedded in his thought typological exegesis is. In the "Lectures on Genesis" Luther comments on his earlier capti vation by allegorical renderings, and enunciates his "Protestant" hermeneutic principles. After presenting his interpretation of the first three chapters of Genesis, Luther asserts that he has treated all these facts in their historical meaning, which is their real and true one. In the interpretation of Holy Scripture the main task must be to derive from it some sure and plain meaning, especially because there is such a variety of interpreters?Latin, Greek, and Hebrew too. Almost all of these not only do not concern themselves with the story but bury it and confuse it with nonsensical allegories.37 Luther then identifies the original sources of "nonsensical allegories": Origen and Jerome. "Everywhere," he says, "they depart from the historical account, which they call the 'letter that kills' and 'the flesh'; and they bestow lofty praise on the 'spiritual meaning,' of which they have no actual knowledge. In fact, Jerome followed Origen as his teacher" (I, 232). As the context makes clear, Luther condemns "nonsensical allegories" which he expressly associates with the Alexandrian school of interpretation. In the same context, he characterizes Scholastic interpretations of his own time as the contemporary extension of Alexandrian allegory. He then comments upon his own earlier use of this mode: When I was a young man, my own attempts at allegory met with fair success. It was even permissible to come up with foolish ideas, since these great teachers of the churches, such as Jerome and Origen, had at times given wide range to their imagination. . . . Augustine, too, was led astray . . . , and, especially in the instance of the Psalms, he disregards the historical sense and has recourse to allegories. They were all</page><page sequence="22">32 convinced that, especially in the historical accounts of the Old Testament, the allegories represented the spiritual meaning; but the historical account itself, or the literal sense, represented the carnal meaning (I, 232). Luther asserts, again in relation to Alexandrian allegory, that such procedures are a "desecration of the sacred writings," and he recommends that beginning students of the Scriptures read the Church Fathers with discretion. As a young man,Luther continues, he lacked that discretion; hence, he was "led astray." He then begins to define his "mature exegetical" principles: Ever since I began to adhere to the historical meaning, I myself have always had a strong dislike for allegories and did not make use of them unless the text itself indicated them or the interpr?tations could be drawn from the New Testament [italics added] (I, 232-233). He then returns to his earlier captivity by the allegorical interpretations of the Origenistic mode: But it was very difficult for me to break away from my habitual zeal for allegory; and yet I was aware that allegories were empty speculations and froth, as it were, of the Holy Scriptures. It is the historical sense alone which supplies true and sound doctrine. After this has been treated and correctly understood, then one may also employ allegories as an adornment and flowers to embellish or illuminate the account. The bare allegories, which stand in no relation to the account and do not illuminate it, should simply be disapproved as empty dreams. This is the kind which Origen and those who followed him employ (I, 233). He then concludes: There is no need at all for dwelling at greater length on this matter of allegory. Let this reminder</page><page sequence="23">33 suffice: that those who wish to make use of allegories, make use of those which the apostles point out and which have a sure basis in the words themselves or in the historical account (I, 234). Luther does not condemn allegory per se,any more than Tyndale does. Luther does condemn Alexandrian allegory, yet he makes clear that allegorical interpretation is a part of the apostles''methods, that allegories are in the texts themselves, and that allegories are a part of the literal sense and his torical account. Such distinctions which Luther makes in the Commentary on Genesis are reiterated in nearly every major work. Unlike Tyndale, however, Luther does not insist that the literal sense is also the spiritual sense; on the contrary, Luther consistently interprets scripture according to a two fold sense: literal and spiritual. Because of its unique message, the Old Testament not only deals with the exper iences of the Hebrew people,but also looks forward to Christ; the Old Testament "law and way of life must therefore be seen in two ways."38 Luther consistently calls the two levels of scripture the literal and spiritual meanings. In the "Preface to the Old Testament," for example, Luther explains that as a history of the Hebrew people and an expression of their faith, the Old Testament Scriptures "are not to be despised, but diligently read" (XXXV, 236), for the Old Testament is the "ground and proof" of the New and is to be "highly regarded." On the other hand, however, beyond the literal meaning of Old Testament events and rites is a "spiritual meaning" (XXXV, 247), for Moses and the prophets "are nothing else than administrators . . . bringing every one to Christ through the law." To interpret the Old Testament "well and confidently," Luther asserts, one must "set Christ before you, for he is the man to whom it all applies, every bit of it" (XXXV, 247). Luther expressly distinguishes his "spiritual" reading from the allegorical interpretations of Origen and Jerome, and "many other distinguished people" (XXXV, 235), for such interpretations are not based upon the literal meaning of the text and by their very nature ignore the historicity of the Old Testament. In contrast to this approach, Luther argues that he respects</page><page sequence="24">34 the historical experiences of the Hebrew people because in Christ the history of the Old Testament actually reaches the goal which God had planned for it. As a result, "Luther can thus place the original literal meaning and the spiritual interpretation beside each other and bring them into a vital relationship to each other through his concept of 'sign1 or 'type.'"39 Luther's typological identifications are extensive; in numerous instances, the type-antitype construct is basic to his view of the sacraments, and typological analysis occupies a central part of his theology.^0 jn addition, throughout his writing types are referred to in the most casual manner, indicating the central place which typology occupies in his thought. In the early "Lectures on Genesis," Luther uses typos, schema, and figura as generally synonymous; in his later writings he ordinarily uses the terms figure and type, quite often together as if to restrict the meaning of the Latin term to its original significance in Greek. Yet Luther is not consistent, using picture, example, and image in the typical sense; because he clearly distinguishes between Alexandrian allegorizing and typology he apparently sees no need for a precise terminology. Moreover, typology is so much a part of his exegesis, that regardless of which term he uses the context makes clear that the various terms are used in a typological sense. And his assumption that "every bit" of the Old Testament applies to Christ leads inevitably to numerous typological identifications. David is a "type of Christ, as are Solomon, Aaron, and all the other figures of the Old Testament";41 twenty-seven psalms are interpreted in a typical sense;^ Melchizedek, the Red Sea, the crossing of the River Jordan, manna, water from Horeb's rock, the brazen serpent, and so on, all have typological significance. For all his use of typology, however, Luther is not simply a medieval allegorist in the robes of a Reformer. It is true that he does not escape making typical identifications closely associated with Alexandrian allegory, for Luther knew the commentaries too well to avoid being influenced by them. It is also true, however, that he recognized and condemned the interpretations of the Alexandrians, particularly as they</page><page sequence="25">35 found their way into the works of the Scholastics. Moreover, he repeatedly insists that biblical interpreters "should strive, so far as possible, to get one, simple, true, and grammatical meaning from the words of the text; and when we have it, then nothing prevents us from seeking figures and allegories in the text" (VIII, 146). Like the authors of the New Testament, Luther's theology is Christological; Christ is presented in the Gospel as the culmination of the pr?figurations of the Law; typology, in this sense, is the literal meaning of the Scriptures. Tyndale's use of typology is cautious and restrained; in Luther's writing typology is only one of numerous exegetical methods and it is ordinarily incidental to the main point at issue. Without typology, however,Calvin would not be Calvin; for typology occupies a central and significant role in his theology. More emphatically than either Tyndale or Luther, Calvin insists that many passages must be interpreted typolo gically: "the whole cultus of the law, taken literally and not as shadows and figures corresponding to the truth, will be utterly ridiculous."43 jn the Institutes, for example, Calvin argues that the infinite majesty of God makes direct communication with him impossible; the references in the Old Testament to individuals who beheld God "face to face" should not be taken to mean that they saw God as "i;e really is," but only "as far as e can be beheld by mortal man. "44 In order to reveal himself, then, it was necessary for God to "veil" his majesty in signs and symbols which man could comprehend. Hence, Revelation involves an original "veiling" and necessi tates a subsequent "unveiling." If God were only a single entity, he would forever remain hidden to the eyes of men; from the beginning,, however, God planned for a Mediator between himself and man in the Old Testament: the Word of God, the second Person of the Trinity. According to Calvin, the frequent appearance of the Angel of the Lord in the Old Testament is, in reality, the record of the veiled appearance of "God's only-begotten Son, who was afterwards manifested in the flesh. . . ." " In his appearance in the Old Testament, however, Christ was veiled in "shadows," for "until Christ was manifested in the flesh all signs shadowed Him. . . ." God's revelation, even through the office of the Mediator in</page><page sequence="26">36 the Old Testament, was, as Calvin notes in the Commentary on Hebrews,^ by the "circuitous course of types and figures" (p. 98). Hence, the Old Testament, far from being solely a history of the Hebrew people and a "book of law," is a "book of promises" which find their realization in Christ. Calvin insists, however, that there is a substantive difference between the "nature or quality of the promises" of the Old Testament and the promises of the New: "the gospel points out with the finger what the law foreshadowed under types" (Institutes, I, 426). Therefore, Calvin warns his readers "to remember to open up their way with [typology,] the key" to understanding the Old Testament and its relationship to the New.46 Calvin's extensive typological identifications are based upon his conviction that Christ is everywhere revealed in the Old Testament, not in his full glory, of course, but in"types and shadows" which are intimations of future fulfillment. According to Calvin, all of the Old Testament represents the "letter" of the Law; the New Testament presents the "spirit" of the New Law. Paul1s statement that the "letter killeth but the spirit giveth life" refers, in Calvin's view, to the essential differences between the shadowed revelations of the Old Testament and the typological reality of the New. But in order to make certain that those under the Law were continually aware of the future promises, God "foreshadowed spiritual happiness by . . . types and symbols," in"figures," and in the "image and shadow" of the future reality. These promises, Calvin asserts, are "mentioned almost wherever the New Testament is contrasted with the Old" (Institutes, I, 452-453). Hence, typology is the single most important method for interpreting the Old Testament, for types provide New Testament authors?and all Christians as well?with a "key" to understanding the promises of Christ in the Old Tes tament. Moreover, as types indicate, the children of Israel did not live under the irrevocable sentence of the Law, but in continual awareness of a greater life to come. For Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, and all of the prophets, repeatedly foreshadow the promises made manifest in the flesh: "it was always their custom to describe through the types of their own time the truth which has been revealed</page><page sequence="27">37 by the gospel" (Institutes, II, 1433). Typology, then, is the handwriting of God; in its "shadowy forms" it reveals the presence of God, as much as his presence can be revealed be fore the sum of all types "became flesh and dwelt among us." Calvin is less severe in his condemnation of allegory than are Tyndale and Luther. He invariably condemns the excesses of Origenistic allegory, yet he often accepts the allegorical readings of "les Docteurs anciens" if the text supports such readings. In discussing Paul's assertion that Abraham's wives are to be interpreted as an allegory of the two covenants, for example, Calvin clearly distinguishes be tween legitimate allegory and "subtle frenzies": He [Paul] says that what is here read, was written allegorically: not that he wishes all histories, indiscriminately, to be tortured to an allegorical sense, as Origen does; who,%by hunting every where for allegories, corrupts the whole Scripture; and others, too, eagerly emulating his example, have extracted smoke out of light. . . . The design of Paul was, to raise the minds of the pious to con sider the secret work of God, in this history; as if he had said, What Moses relates concerning the house of Abraham belongs to the spiritual kingdom of Christ; since, certainly, that house was a lively image of the Church.47 In this passage, and others as well, although Calvin condemns Alexandrian allegory, he accepts without question the restricted application of allegorical interpretation. Moreover, he asserts that what has been said of the house of Abraham (the Jewish nation) is a type ("lively image") of the church. On the other hand, in discussing the distinctions made in the ceremonial law between clean and unclean animals, Calvin accepts with little hesitation the allegorical inter pretations of "les Docteurs anciens" as found in the Glossa Ordinaria: Whilst I fear that but little confidence can be placed in allegories, in which many have taken delight; so I do not find fault with, nor even refuse that which</page><page sequence="28">38 has been handed down from "les Docteurs anciens," viz., that by the cleaving of the hoof is signified prudence in distinguishing the mysteries of Scrip ture, and by the chewing of the cud serious medita tion on its heavenly doctrines; although I cannot approve of the subtlety which they add, viz., that those "rightly divide the word" who have known how to elicit mystical senses from its letter; because hence it has come to pass that they have allowed themselves in all sorts of imaginations. I there fore embrace the more simple notion, that they who only have a taste for the carnal sense, do not divide the hoof. . . . The chewing of the cud ought to fol low, duly to prepare and digest the spiritual food: for many gulp down Scripture without profit. . . . It would be misleading to assert that this kind of interpre tation is common in Calvin; it is equally misleading to say that he condemns out of hand either allegorical or typologi cal readings.^ In discussing the idea of reform in the early church, Gerhart B. Ladner suggests that the greatest contribution, perhaps, of the Old Testa ment to Christian ideology of reform was through prophecy and "typology." The prophets not only fore told the coming of Christ, but they also are the great exemplars of all authentic reformers within the Church .... Furthermore, all through Christian history, typology, the sacramentum futuri, the mystery of the expectation and anticipation of Christ and the Church in the Old Testament, acted as a stimulus for further reform in the spirit of the Gospel: the sequence of creation, Incarnation and reform is a fundamental pattern in early Christian and mediaeval historical SO consciousness and theology of history. u One cannot say with certainty whether typology was an impetus to reform or simply a by-product of the larger concerns of the Reformation. It is certain, however, that typology, iso</page><page sequence="29">39 lated from Alexandrian allegory 'and divorced from the extrav agances of medieval Scholasticism, is a central part of the Reformers' approach to the Scriptures. This is not to say that Protestant typologists consistently avoid superimposing allegorical readings upon type-antitype identifications; it is to insist, however, that Protestant allegory is not simply a re-worked version of Origenistic practice. There are two significant differences. First, the allegory of Protestant typologists is in formed by a twofold sense of biblical hermeneutics; it does not attempt to determine tropological and anagogical readings beyond the literal and spiritual levels. Such readings occur, but they are viewed as part of, not in addition to, the spiritual or Gospel interpretation. The distinction, to the Puritans particularly, is not simply an artificial one; for from their point of view, any additional reading is twice re moved from the literal sense and is a distortion of it. All passages have a literal and spiritual meaning; the spiritual meaning may have, and often does have, moral and eschatologi cal implications, but in every case these arise from the literal level. Second, Protestant allegory, unlike Alexan drian allegory, is based upon an extensive analysis of the typical event. Alexandrian allegory essentially subordinates types, relegating them exclusively to the literal sense or discarding them entirely. In Protestant allegory, however, typology becomes of crucial significance; for types are one of the two central methods by which the Old and New Testaments are related. Hebrew prophecy is the second; and from the work of the earliest biblical authors, prophecy, after its fulfillment in Christ, becomes part of the typolo gical message. Prophecy implies future fulfillment; typology asserts that the consummation has occurred. Hence, Protestant allegory based on typical identifications, limits the vehicle of allegory to the Old Testament and its tenor to the New. Origen's allegorical interpretation which identifies the clean animals in the Ark with "memory, culture,understanding, reflection and judgement upon what we read" and the unclean animals with "desire and anger";or, the clean animals as also signifying the seven powers of the soul and the unclean</page><page sequence="30">40 animals representing the ill uses which man too often makes of the powers of the soul, is a clear extension beyond the confines of Scripture. To Samuel Mather, however, the clean and unclean beasts signify that in the Church there are both Saints and Hypocrites: 'Hypocrites are unclean Beasts. A Cham in the Ark; a Judas, a Devil in Christ's own Family. In the visible Church there be sometimes Wolves within, and Sheep without: Thof they are Wolves in Sheeps cloth ing; for prophane Persons may, and should be kept out; but close Hypocrites cannot. As in the Ark thof there were ravenous Beasts; yet their Natures were re strained; So in the Church, such as are Beasts by nature; yet the Corruption of their Natures is re strained, there is restraining Grace upon Hypocrites in the Church, as well as renewing Grace in the Saints (Figures or Types, p. 75). Both Origen and Mather interpret the Ark as a type of the church and the deluge as a type of baptism. Beyond this typological identification, however, Origen sees a "deeper mystery" which can only be understood by moving beyond the limits of the Bible to subjective allegorism. Mather also allegorizes the same passages; in each case, however, the type-antitype construct limits his allegory solely to the relationship between the two testaments. It would be mis leading to assert that the differences between the two approaches are always this explicit. Augustine also inter prets the clean and unclean beasts as a sign that "good and bad take part in the sacraments of the Church,"51 avoiding in this instance the allegorical abstractions of Origen; and at times Mather's allegorizing is hard to distinguish from Ori genTs practice. In most cases, however, the distinctions are clear, and it is the relative importance allotted to typology which marks the line between Patristic and Protestant allegory. The ultimate significance of typology lies beyond the theological idiom in which it is expressed. Regardless of how much theorists of typology might insist, as Samuel Mather</page><page sequence="31">41 does, that "... all this typical Dispensation is expired and abolished by the exhibition of Jesus Christ the Truth and Substance and Scope of all" (pp. 539-540), the peculiar cir cumstances of the New England experiment?the New Exodus, the journey through the Wilderness, the establishment of a New Israel, and so on?provided the Puritan with a continuous analogy to the great biblical dramas. At every point in his life, and in the life of the New England theocracy, his experiences reflected what must have seemed to be a divinely constituted series of parallels to the recorded acts of God's providence to the Hebrews. Thus an imagistic consciousness based upon typology pervaded Puritan thought. The cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night which had guided the Hebrew children through their wilderness wanderings prefigured Christ's guiding role to his church. And that church was part of the divine plan which New England ful filled in the history of Christianity. To someone like Edward Taylor, then, the parallels between his "wilderness wanderings" and the experiences of God's first Chosen People were irrefutable testimony that history-?and New England history in particular?was in fact the handmaiden of the Lord. Hence, such imagery made even more real the "shadow" of the living Messiah in the Westfield minister's study: Then lead me, Lord, through all this Wilderness By this Choice shining Pillar Cloud and Fire. By Day, and Night I shall not then digress. If thou wilt lead, I shall not lag nor tire But as to Cana'n I am journeying ,-? I shall thy praise under this Shadow sing. Thomas M.

Miller s citation from The Obedience is incorrect; the first sentence ("Such allegory proveth nothing, it is a mere simile") does not occur in the same context as the second, but two pages earlier in relation to a fictitious allegory which Tyndale presents as an example of the methods of Patristic allegorizing. See The Work of William Tyndale, ed. G.E. Duffield, The Courtenay Library of Reformation Classics (Appleford, Berkshire, 1964), I, 345. Subsequent citations refer to Vol. I of this edition.

See "A Pathway into the Holy Scripture," p. 15. 35 In discussing Tyndale's attitude toward typology I have limited my analysis to those works which deal specifically with principles of exegesis and translation, works published primarily before the development of Tyndale's theology of the "contract." In A briefe declaration of the sacraments (London, 1548), however, the dominant mode of exegesis is typological, and Tyndale presents an elaborate series of typological identifications. Of. One hesitates to belabor Miller's inaccuracies in relation to the Reformers' use of typology; yet his comments have been widely accepted and, hence, have led to a misunder standing of the nature of Puritan typology. According to Miller, after the disciples of Bonaventure had formulated an eightfold sense of scriptural interpretation, "Luther thought it time to call a halt and assert: 'The literal sense of Scripture alon?is the whole essence of faith and of Christian theology.'" Miller continues: "Each passage, Luther declared, has one clear, definite and true sense of its own; allegories are empty speculations, 'and as it were the scum of Holy Scripture'" (Roger Williams, p. 35). In several places Luther does insist that the literal sense contains the sum of faith; his exegetical principles, however, are not that simple. His comments in relation to New Testament typology are invariably favorable. Moreover, in the most obvious places Luther defends allegory, properly used, and practices</page><page sequence="37">47 typological exegesis (the Preface to the Old Testament, for example). There are numerous, and quite obvious, places in the Works where Luther practices allegorical and typological interpretation. It is difficult to reconcile Miller's statements with such extensive evidence to the contrary. 37 "Lectures on Genesis," Luther's Works, ed. Jaroslav Pelikan (St. Louis, 1958), I, 231. Unless otherwise noted, subsequent references to Lutherfe writing are to this edition. 38 Paul Althaus, The Theology of Martin_Luther (Philadelphia, 1966), p. 95. I am indebted to Althaus' discussion of Luther's hermeneutic principles. 39 Althaus, p. 97. 40 In the sacramental controversies of 1524-1527, for example, Luther carefully distinguishes among the different terms which are used to explain Christ's statement, "This is my body." Because of his developing theory of consubstantia tion, Luther insists that there is a literal equation of the bread and Christ's flesh. Several of his opponents had interpreted the text to read,"This is the figura of my body," using the term to mean the "real essence." Luther's answer to this point indicates in a specific and concrete way his knowledge of New Testament typology and his rejection of the Alexandrian connotations of figura: "... figura is an obscure and ambiguous word. Of course, he [Oecolampadius, Luther's opponent] would like to interpret it to mean parable, type, or interpretative sign, just as one describes the stories in the Old Testament as figures of the New, as Adam is called a figure or type of Christ, or as a bride is called a type or figure of the Church. But figura in the Latin language does not mean that kind of type; the word figura is misused in such an instance" (XXXVII, 109). 41 Luther: Early Theological Works, ed.

As my citations indicate, Calvin uses "image," "figure," "foreshadow," "shadow," and "promises" (in reference to the Old Testament) as synonymous with "type." In discussing the "Peculiarities in Calvin's Exegesis," H. Jackson Forstman calls attention to the typological meaning of these terms and notes that Calvin had a"weakness for typology"(Word and Spirit: Calvin's Doctrine of Biblical Authority, Stanford, 1962, p. 106). 44 Commentary on Ezekiel, cited in Ronald S. Wallace, Calvin's Doctrine of the Word and Sacrament (Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1957), p. 2. I am indebted to Wallace's excellent analysis of Calvin's doctrine of Revelation. 45 "Commentaries on the Four Last Books of Moses," Calvin's Commentaries (Grand Rapids,Michigan, 1956), I, 248. Unless otherwise noted, all citations to the commentaries refer to this edition. 46 Calvin's identification of typology as the "key" to "open up" the Old Testament is found in the Institutes, Book II, p. 447. My discussion is a brief summary of the principles which Calvin develops at length in Book II of the Institutes. 47 Commentary on Genesis, I, 545. 48 "Commentaries on the Four Last Books of Moses," II, 61-62. Calvin1s assumption that everything in the Old Testament foreshadows Christ occasionally leads to rather</page><page sequence="39">49 extravagant identifications. One should note, however, that unlike most of medieval allegory, Calvin's "excesses" arise from an attempt to make sense of the literal meaning of the Hebrew rites and ceremonies. Moreover, Calvin's predicament is based upon his conviction?shared by the Puritans?of the absolute authority of all Scripture; to admit that certain aspects of tie ceremonial regulations are only reflections of the peculiarities of Jewish worship in a specific historical period would open the door to human decisions concerning the validity of any portion of Scripture, Old or New Testaments, and effectively destroy the sole authority of the Bible. It is in this context that Calvin asserts (as Miller cites in Roger Williams, p. 35), that "it is better to con fess our ignorance than indulge in frivolous conjectures." The passage in which this citation occurs is Calvin's discus sion of the dimensions and ceremonial significance of the Tabernacle ("Commentaries on the Four Last Books of Moses," p. 174). The Tabernacle, Calvin notes, was not to be viewed as an end in itself, for "... the people should not rest their attention on tie visible tabernacle,but with the under standing of faith should penetrate to heaven, and direct their minds to the spiritual pattern, the shadows and types of which they behold" (p. 174). Calvin then proceeds to interpret the Tabernacle, its furniture, and the garments of the High Priest typologically.
