<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Opovo Project: a Study of Socioeconomic Change in the Balkan Neolithic Ruth Tringham University of California, Berkeley Bogdan Brukner Institute of History Novi Sad, Yugoslavia assisted by Barbara Voytek University of California, Berkeley with Contributions by Various Staff Members This report provides the preliminary results of an archaeological project cur- rently underway in the Vojvodina, Yugoslavia. The project focuses on the site of Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk, which lies in the lower valley of the Tamis' River, north of the Danube. Excavation of the site began in the summer of 1983. Materials so far uncovered indicate that the site represents a late neolithic/ early eneolithic settlement, belonging to the Vinca-Plocnik culture. The pro- ject is designed to investigate problems generated by earlier research efforts in the area of the late neolithic and early eneolithic of SE Europe. In addi- tion, it provides an opportunity to study variation within the Vinca culture, in terms of its regional setting and its economic activities. Introduction The summers of 1983 and 1984 witnessed the suc- cessful beginning of a research project that focuses on the site of Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk, Vojvodina, Yugoslavia.1 The combined efforts of the international team provided the data presented here which, although preliminary, demonstrate the potential of this project for the study of socioeconomic developments during the neolithic in SE Europe. Setting and Background The site lies in the lower valley of the Tami' River, 20 km from its confluence with the Danube. It is situated in the sw part of the Banat in the Autonomous Region of Vojvodina in the S.R. Serbia, Yugoslavia (FIG. 1). The modern village of Opovo lies ca. 20 km north of the city of Pan'evo to whose "opstina" (county) it be- longs. The site of Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk is located on a well drained hillock. It covers an area ca. 250 m x 200 m (ca. 5 ha) that is surrounded by seasonally waterlogged land (FIG. 2). The elevation represents a degraded loess terrace following an old meander path of the Tami' River ca. 78 m above sea level. Over most of this area, the cultural deposits are found at a depth of 1.6 m, but in certain places they reach a depth of 2.5 m below the surface. The deposits all belong to the period of the late Vin'a-Tordol/early Vin'a-Plo'nik culture dated by com- parative carbon-14 dates (uncalibrated) to 4300-3700 1. The project is funded by the Joint U.S.-Yugoslav Fund for Co- operative Scientific, Cultural and Technical Research and sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. Additional funding is provided by the University Research Expeditions Program (UREP), University of California. The joint American-Yugoslav team worked under the co-direction of Dr. Ruth Tringham of the Department of Anthropology, University of Califorriia, Berkeley, and Dr. Bogdan Brukner of the Institute of History, University of Novi Sad, in con- junction with the Narodni Muzej, Pan'evo. During the 1983 season, a number of student volunteers from England and Yugoslavia assisted with the excavation. During the 1984 season, eight volunteers from UREP participated. In addition, four students from the Department of Soil Science, Agricultural University, Wageningen, Holland, car- ried out a series of pedological sondages and auger borings under the supervision of Professor Pons and Professor Van der Plas. The project core team consisted of eight American and Yugoslav archaeologists: L. Bukvid, T. Kaiser, N. Russell, P. Stehli, M. Stevanovid, B. Voytek, and the two co-directors.

Surface collection as well as the results of the first excavation seasons indicated that the archaeological data consist of rich debris of well preserved wattle-and-daub structures, bone and stone tools, faunal remains, ceram- ics and figurines, and other artifacts of clay. The site at present is ca. 4 km from the banks of the Tami' River, but in prehistoric times the river, or at least one of its branches, lay very close to the site. In recent historical times, the Tami', like the Tisza to its west, has been straightened and drained. It has been suggested, however, that in the period of the Vinia culture, the river and its branches were much more liable to flooding and created numerous lakes, ponds, and marshes by its dead or inactive meanders. Moreover, the water table was higher and much of the land was seasonally, if not constantly, waterlogged.2 The soils formed on the loess are fertile chernozems which, it has been suggested, were developed under steppe vegetation,3 although forest-steppe has also been hypothesized.4 At present these soils are intensively used for grain cultivation and otherwise are covered by steppe grassland. As the loess degrades into brown earth, es- pecially towards the east of Opovo, the dominant veg- etation, where not under cultivation, becomes mixed oak forest with thick undergrowth. In the marshy depressions and the river flood plains there are ribbon forests of willow, poplar, and alder as well as water meadows.5 It is clear that the varied vegetation was likely to have supported a rich variety of fauna: birds, deer, pigs, fish and so on. The natural environmental conditions for early agriculturalists were favorable, especially if they were prepared to take advantage of the broad spectrum of natural food resources. The drainage pattern caused problems for cultivation and settlement, but also served to enrich the local biomass. In addition, the Banat is accessible from, and has access to, all parts of the Balkan peninsula and Central Europe by way of its central position in the middle part of the Danube Basin, near the confluences of a number of the latter's largest tributaries: the Drava and Sava from the west; the Tisza, Maros, and Tami' itself from the north and NE; and the Morava from the south (FIG. 1). The project at Opovo has been designed to investigate research problems that have been generated by the large corpus of excavated data on the late neolithic and early eneolithic cultures of SE Europe,6 and the Vinia culture of NE Yugoslavia in particular.'

The two projects comprised the excavation of Vin'a culture settlements at Selevac and Gomolava (FIG. 1).8 The research was designed for the study of many of the problems arising out of both these projects. Long-Term Objectives of the Project In view of the potential of the site of Opovo-Bajbuk and the results obtained to date, the objectives of the project have been decided as follows. 1. To investigate the process by which the culture and economy of the early agriculturalists north of the Danube first transformed their food production and resource ex- ploitation into a successful and productive system. The project at Opovo represents the first attempts to investigate the processes of socioeconomic change north of the Danube. The focus of this objective is the study of intensification of production following the reduction in residential mobility that characterized late neolithic society in Europe. One of the most significant research aims of the Opovo research is to provide data on the exploitation of food and non-food resources that will enable comparison of this same process with that studied south of the Danube in the lower Morava valley at Selevac, and with comparable data in the Danube valley itself, from Gomolava and Vin'a, for example, and fur- ther north in Hungary.9 2. To investigate the increasing permanence of settle- ment (degree of sedentismireduction of residential mo- bility) during the occupation of the site of Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk. Sedentism, although perhaps not the direct cause, appears to be a precondition of complex social organi- zation. It has been argued that, in response to the conditions imposed by the development of sedentary, permanent settlements, various changes occurred during the neolithic in Yugoslavia, reflecting processes of in- tensification, specialization, and diversification of pro- duction activities.10 The strategy to investigate increasing permanence of settlement lies in estimating the duration or period of occupation of houses, and examining the pattern of the replacement of houses and formation of the archaeological deposits, and estimating the invest- ment and commitment made by a society to its land by modifying the landscape. Thus an important part of the testing for increasing permanence of settlement lies in the examination of structural remains throughout the history of the settlement to reconstruct changes in the use of building materials and methods of construction. 3. To investigate the emergence of the household as the primary unit of social and economic organization during the occupation of Opovo. It has been hypothesized that during the emergence of the Domestic Mode of Production, the household be- comes the primary unit of social reproduction.1 In this model the household with its regular cycle of demo- graphic and economic growth and decline promotes long-term stability of social organization in which short- term inequalities rather than cumulative salient ranking are a characteristic feature.12 The aim at Opovo is to begin to test whether or not such a process is operating in the early agricultural societies of the Middle Danube Basin. The problem is how to test such a model of social transformation with the archaeological data available. Obviously, it is dangerous to assume that a "house" can be equated with a "household," without investigation of the architectural units and their associated finds. The Opovo project aims at such an investigation by combin- ing detailed analyses of production sequences and loci with systematic investigation of the houses themselves and associated finds. The project, therefore, involves large-scale exposure of a building area, as at Gomolava, but in contrast to the research design implemented at Selevac.

Mu'ijevi6 of the Geophysical Insti- tute (Geoinstitut), Beograd, of a 45 m x 200 m strip across the site, including the proposed area of the ex- cavation (FIG. 3). Eighteen major anomalies of high mag- netic intensity (degree of intensity varying from 20 to 100) were identified. An area of exceptional frequency of the anomalies was noted in the NW of the analyzed area and proposed as an area that would be suitable for excavation, in that the areas of magnetic anomalies would be likely to correspond to the mass of burned clay rubble that represents the burned and collapsed remains of neolithic houses. Archaeological Excavation The area chosen for the site of the excavation lies towards the northern edge of the prehistoric site (FIG. 4). In July, 1983, a 16 m x 20 m block was marked out for the archaeological excavation. The block is oriented lengthwise N-S, in line with the basic 10-m-square grid of the site. It was divided into 2-m quadrats, which form the main units of excavation and recording of the ar- chaeological materials. Two arbitrary levels (or "spits") were excavated in 1983 to an average depth of 0.44 m below the surface (level 1: 0.29 m; level 2: 0.45 m). During 1984 one artificial excavation layer was excavated (designated o.s. 3) entirely, except for the NE corner of the block where Feature 4 is situated. The maximum depth reached is ca. 0.65 m below the modem surface. The soil matrix is humic chernozem of a very dark brown color. The plough does not seem to have cut below the level of the first artificial spit in general. It appears to have spread and redeposited rubble from only the surface of the highest architectural features (i.e., Features 1 and 5 and the top of 2 and 4). A horizon of domestic features was clearly recogniz- able from the base of the first arbitrary level to the base of o.s. 3. The features comprise areas of concentrated burned clay (house rubble), distinctive in their com- pactness and bright orange color. The areas vary as to size and degree of compactness (FIG. 5). Some of them represent areas of primary deposition from the in situ burning and collapse of structures (probably dwellings- e.g., Features 2 and 4 and possibly the western part of Feature 1). Some represent the secondary deposition of primary materials from spreading, weathering, and ero- sion after the collapse and abandonment of the dwellings (e.g., Feature 5). The three areas of primary deposition of rubble (Fea- tures 2 and 4 and the western part of Feature 1) lie completely within the area of the excavated block so that their shape and dimensions may be defined (FIG. 5). As far as can be determined at the base of the third arbitrary level, these three areas are roughly square in plan and represent the foundations of structures (houses) oriented NE-SW, whose dimensions are 5-7 m x 5-8 m. The mass of burned clay rubble contains numbers of complete crushed ceramic vessels, clay weights, figu- rines, grindstones, polished and flaked stone edge tools, bone tools and broken pieces of bone from food debris, and many other remains of domestic activities. In addi- tion, in the burned clay, there are well preserved impres- sions of the wood and wattle frame of the structure.

Two large areas of secondary deposition of structural materials lie to the north of Feature 2 (Feature 5) and in the eastern part of Feature 1. Between July 7 and 22, 1983, these features were cleaned of the humic earth that covered them. The excavation season of July 5 to August 5, 1984, focused on the careful cleaning of the burned structural features, lifting up the rubble and mapping it layer by layer, and taking systematic samples for later analysis. Within excavation layer 3, two main levels of house rubble collapse were defined; the lower (second) level was more solid and was the basis of the mapping of the tree impressions in the clay rubble (FIGS. 5, 6). Recording was carried out according to cells (ea. 1 sq m) in and around the structural features. The remains of the wattle- and-daub houses were more carefully excavated and more systematically and fully mapped, recorded, and sampled than on any other neolithic sites yet excavated in SE Europe. This was because one of the main aims of the Opovo Archaeological Project was the detailed in- vestigation of the construction and use-lives of buildings in order to test hypotheses on resource utilization, du- ration of settlement, and differentiation in the architec- tural process with the change in the unit of economic and social cooperation of the early agricultural socie- ties.13 13.

There was some doubt, after excavation, that Feature 1 actually represents a primary deposition of occupation and structural debris. The interpretation will have to await confirmation from the presence of postholes and other substructural foun- dations in the 1985 season. In the clearly secondarily deposited material on the eastern side of Feature 1, were found two very small (but definite) fragments of copper. Feature 2 The best preserved parts of this structure are its west- ern and sw parts. The dimensions are ca. 5.5 m x 8.0 m and its orientation is NE-SW. The external walls are not preserved as upright, in situ foundations, but on the sw side the external wall can be clearly seen collapsed into the interior of the structure. A clear division between rubble concentration and the area outside the building is visible on all sides except the northern edge and possibly the NW edge. In other areas the surrounding soil matrix has virtually no house rubble. Internal divisions and furniture are most visible in the western half of the feature. One internal wall, whose base is still standing (ca. 25 cm high) partially defines a room in the NW part of the structure (FIG. 7). The room so defined contained the following. a) Oven: the collapsed but clear superstructure and floor of an oven is the main feature of the room. It has the usual character, shape, and size (ca. 70 cm D.) of Vinca ovens. The oven is abutted against the internal wall of the building, and apparently against its outside NW wall. This arrange- ment is also quite characteristic of Vinia-Plo'nik structures (FIG. 7, nos. 6, 9).14 14. B.

Feature 2 (1984). (Photo: M. Trninid) b) Storage pot: dug slightly below the "floor" of the building, with its walls made of very poorly fired clay (possibly made of the same clay as the house walls them- selves); it protrudes above the level of the building "floor" and is incorporated into the corner of the internal wall of the "room" (FIG. 7, no. 3). c) Clay "pedestal": a solid clay "pedestal," 40 cm high, 40 cm in diameter at its base, 30 cm at its top, lying on its side (FIG. 8). Originally it stood upright to the north of the oven. As it fell over, it crushed one or two pots. The "pedestal" is made of what appears to be the same clay as the building superstructure. It was fired reddish on the out- side and greyer on the inside. As it lay on its side, a slab 20 cm thick was sliced off its side by the plough. It is associated with a number of bowls and pots, crushed in the fire and building collapse, including one bowl with a spiral symbol impressed on its surface (FIG. 8). In the vicinity were a burned grindstone and a storage pot surrounded by building clay and incorporated into the floor of the building. The pedestal is also associated with a hollow clay "head" molded into a half-dome with two "ears," but otherwise without any surviving surface decoration (FIG. 8). It is sug- gested, because of its position, diameter of its base, and similarity of the base surface with that of the top of the "pedestal," that originally this "head" stood on top of the "pedestal." The "head" is made of the same coarse building clay (or so it seems at first glance) as the "pedestal." Similar heads and pedestals are known, for example, from the neo- lithic settlements of south Bulgaria, such as Stara Zagora Bolnica.15 In addition to the large number of crushed pots in this "room," especially in the area to the north of the oven, there was a group of 11 ceramic sherds, perforated at one end, and all trimmed to a uniform ovaloid shape, which it has been suggested were reused as weights or tallies. paper presented at the symposium "Palast und Hiitte" (1982); ex- amples found at the sites of Gomolava and Vinca. 15.

J*9~d Feature 5 This is a secondary deposition from Feature 2. It is rich in fragments of grindstones, clay figurines, faunal debris, and, in the NW comer of the feature, a number of fragments of burned human bone. The latter do not seem to come from any cremation burial nearby, but would seem more likely to represent the remains of an exposed corpse, which had been carried (by dogs, on the basis of gnaw-marks on some of the bones) into the settlement area and had burned in the house-fire. Fea- tures 9 and 10 are areas of relatively solid burned house rubble which adjoin Feature 2. Feature 4 The foundations of an external wall were visible on the NE edge of the feature, which measures ca. 6 m X 6 m and is oriented NE-SW. There are no clear outside walls on any other side, but there is a clear demarcation of the concentration of house rubble from the surround- ing soil matrix, in which there is virtually no house rubble. Internal features are hard to see as yet, since the excavation of Feature 4 is not yet complete. It seems, however, that there is no evidence for internal walls or an oven. In the NE comer of the building, a round gap in the house rubble concentration (ca. 1 m D.) has variously been interpreted as a tree hole, internal pit within the house, and later pit dug into the building from above. Its resolution must await further study. Feature 3 This feature lies to the north of Feature 4. At the end of the 1983 season it comprised a solid area of house rubble, but in fact was only one layer thick. It is thus an area of solid but nevertheless secondarily deposited house rubble. Our impression is, therefore, that this house rubble was probably moved from Feature 4 by ploughing, but not moved very far. It is most logical to conclude that it followed the same pattern of dispersal as that from Feature 2 to Feature 5, i.e., in a northward direction (following also the visible ploughmarks). The possibility remains, however, that we are mis- taken about the secondary nature of Feature 3 and that it is part of an in situ deposition of a structure. In the SE edge of the feature is a group of 7-8 grindstones and large fragments, which may originally have been depos- ited outside the northern edge of Feature 4. The same may be said for the remains of a large amphora on its sw edge. It is possible that the wall foundation in Feature 4 is an external one and that Feature 3 represents an extension of it. The final interpretation of the feature thus must await the completion of the excavation of Feature 4. The boundaries of Features 2 and 4, as defined at present, would lead us to suppose that they are both smaller and squarer than the Vin'a-Plo'nik houses known from the Morava and middle Danube valleys.16 16.

Detail of pedestal, clay "head" and ceramic vessel in situ. (Photo: M. Tminid) In both cases, however, there is some doubt as to whether or not we have the definite limits of the struc- ture. Feature 2 could expand westwards, but its width/ length of 8 m is definite; Feature 4 could expand north- wards, but its width/length of 6.6 m is definite. The definition of limits of the features by observations of subsurface foundations (postholes) will be one of the goals of future excavation. As to the interpretation of the structures, there is no doubt that Feature 2 is a domestic structure for residence. It has the internal features observed in many other resi- dential structures from this period in SE Europe: ovens, internal divisions, crushed pots, etc. Feature 4, on the other hand, so far has no oven or internal divisions, but has probably been less well preserved than Feature 2. At present it seems likely that it, too, represents a resi- dential structure. These two structures will be compared from the point of view of duration of occupation, period of use-life in which destruction occurred, methods and materials of construction, cause of destruction (all through observations of microstratigraphy), nature of associated artifacts and debris, and nature of the burned and collapsed clay rubble. The materials associated with the features can safely be dated by ceramic typological affinities to the late Vin'a culture (Vin'a-Plo'nik C2, possibly DI), which has been dated by comparative C-14 dates (uncalibrated) to 3850-3700 b.c. Pedological Sampling The aim of the pedological sampling (see note 1) was to get information on the agricultural and other resources of the micro-region (5 km radius) of the site during the period of the neolithic settlement, as well as on the nature and depth of the anthropogenic and natural soils across the site. These aims naturally include a study of the formation of the palaeosoils on the site and its im- mediate vicinity. Towards these aims in 1983 a N-S transect of 18 bore- holes was made across the site to a maximum depth of 3 m at intervals ca. 30 m on a line parallel to the grid of the site, and 2 m from the eastern edge of the exca- vated block (FIG. 4). In 1984 two additional transects of soil probes were made across the site. These probes were 50 m apart, except near the archaeological site where they were closer, and were to a depth of 2-4 m (FIG. 4). From the borings, the following measurements were de- termined (FIG. 9): (1) The depth of the decalcified chernozem, which in the southern part of the site is very close to the surface and in the northern part (i.e., near the excavated block) is ca. 50 cm below the present surface. (2) The Ah, AC, and C horizons. Below the black homogeneous humic chernozem (Ah zone) a mixed soil (AC zone) occurs in which black humic chernozem ma- terial is mixed with pure loess. This zone extends nor- mally from about 50 cm to 100 cm and shows the extensive biological activity in these soils.

At depths between 100 cm and 300 cm the C horizon lies under the AC. In the case of two borings immediately east of the excavated area, the lowest level of the cultural horizon actually lies on the boundary of the mixed soil and the loess (C zone) itself. (3) The levels of house rubble. The main level, rep- resented also by the burned house remains excavated during the 1983 and 1984 seasons, lies across the site at a depth of 50-80 cm. In one or two borings, just north of the excavated area, there occurs a later burned rubble horizon at a depth of 30 cm superimposed on the major horizon. Earlier burned rubble horizons at 1.60-2.99 m depth occur in most borings across the site. A very early horizon (that lying directly on the loess) lies at a depth of 3.00 m in two borings immediately east of the exca- vated area (Block I). To what extent these "burned rubble horizons" represent actual occupational horizons or re- deposited materials will be tested by subsequent borings, sondages, and excavations. The north and south boundaries of the neolithic site are clearly seen in the borings, and coincide well with (although they mark a smaller area than) those observed on the basis of surface collection of prehistoric materials. On this basis, the Vinca-Plo'nik occupation area is at least 280 m across, and the northern edge of the exca- vated block lies 60 m south of the northern edge of the site. The wider spread of cultural materials on the surface is to some extent the result of modem ploughing. In addition to the transects, a pedological sondage was dug, 1 m x 1 m, 60 m north of the excavated block, in order to investigate more carefully the soils at the edge of the site. Furthermore, in 1983 two more sondages (1 m x 1 m) and six borings were made on an E-W line north of the prehistoric site to study the formation of the chernozem zones and the salt- and sodium-rich soils, to take palynological samples, and to aid the reconstruction of the area of running and stagnant water in the vicinity of the site (see FIG. 2). A 1 m x 1 m test trench, Sonda I, was excavated in 1983 to a depth of 3 m, 1.5 m south of Block I at the sw corner (FIG. 4). The sondage shows that the humic chernozem extends from the surface to a depth of ca. 60 cm. The cultural layer extends from the surface down- wards to 1.65-1.85 m. Below this are pits dug at least 2.35 m deep into the loess subsoil. Immediately to the east of Sonda I, Sonda II was dug in 1984 to a depth of 3 m (FIG. 4). At the bottom, a probe was made to a depth of 5 m below the surface. Groundwater was met at 4.5 m below surface. The fol- lowing brief summary combines the observations of both sondages: Ah Horizon. A thick humic chernozem, surface to 170 cm, this horizon contains much evidence of human activity. To a depth of 80 cm, only few small artifacts are found. Thus, the archaeological horizon seen in 1983-84 was not clear in the SW of the block. A concentration of larger artifacts is present from 80 to 100 cm, which can be rec- ognized as an occupation level. This level, however, is older than the houses excavated in Block I in 1983-84; it contains large pieces of burned clay rubble (burned at different tem- peratures), faunal remains, lithic fragments, and numerous ceramic sherds. AC Horizon. This transition between the upper humus layer and the soil parent material (depth, 170-280 cm) is dominated by animal activity. This horizon contains many more or less vertical earthworm holes and large, filled holes formed by sisals. No artifacts were found in the matrix of this horizon. C Horizon. This horizon, (the raw soil material), starts at a depth of 280 cm; it contains much fewer earthworm holes with very few pieces of small burned rubble, which were brought down by the worms. The matrix comprises so-called lowland loess, which was deposited by riverlike currents. We may thus conclude that, at the point of the sondages, only one occupation level existed. Latex profile molds were taken of both Sonda I and II in order to study the structure of the soils on a micro- scopic scale and their chemistry at the laboratory in Wageningen. There is no doubt on the basis of the preliminary observations made in these soundings that the area around the site was marshy, with a great deal of water (either running or stagnant) and a high water table. It is supposed, on this basis, that the area actually available for cultivation would have been limited al- though highly fertile. It is also supposed (but by no means proven) that the area of wooded country around the site would have been limited and that the natural vegetation on the nonmarshy areas would have been steppe grassland. The loess subsoil, along with its chernozem product, is very clayey (30%) and rich in calcareous products (before decalcification). This means that, at least in its prehistoric state, the humic soils and immediate subsoils would both have been suitable as building materials and probably also for the manufacture of ceramics. Geomorphological Study During the 1984 season, a geomorphological map was constructed, based on a contour map. The landscape is considered to be a fluviatile "lowland loess" landscape, in which the sediments are modelled by riverlike cur- rents. The sediments are loessoid, rather heavy textured, containing some sand, and strongly calcareous. The following geomorphological divisions were de- termined.</page><page sequence="12">436 Opovo: the Balkan Neolithic/Tringham, Brukner, and Voytek 1. High natural river levees (max. ca. 78 m above sea level). 2. Lower natural river levees (76.5-75.5 m above sea level). 3. Flat areas (76-74.5 m above sea level) not affected by salinity with a normal crop. 4. Small gullies relatively high lying. 5. Broad gullies, low lying with solonetzic soils, partly filled-up old river beds with flat bottoms, covered by grass- land (74-74.5 m above sea level). 6. Closed depressions. 7. Archaeological tell-like area. Relatively high-lying area with archaeological remains (average 76 m, highest point is 77 m, above sea level). The results of the pedological investigations so far indicate that the site comprises a kind of "tell" ca. 2.5- 3 m high with a diameter of 200-250 m. The level of the "tell" is 75.5-77 m above sea level; it is located more or less in the middle of an island surrounded by the remains of a very broad (250 m) river course. Along this river course natural levees formed to a level of more than 78 m above sea level; i.e., more than 1 m higher than the highest point of the "tell" and up to 2 m higher than most of the area of the site. Thus, during the formation of the highest levees the tell-like area was covered by at least 2-3 m of water, so that any human activity would have been impossible at the site. The occupation of the site, therefore, must have occurred either before or after the formation of the high natural levees. The occupation before its formation seems more likely. Subsequently, the original landscape, in which the tell-like area was located and formed the highest point, would have been buried or eroded with time and transformed into the present landscape. Originally the "tell" would have been an irregular mound, surrounded by much lower land. The river was developing broad meanders with natural levees at a dis- tance from the tell. Before completing the formation of its levees and the filling up of its valleys, the river abandoned its course and began to form a new channel. The landscape shows a number of these abandoned, unfilled depressions, all bordered by unfinished natural levees, pointing to a rapid shift of the Tami' River to its present position. North and west of the tell-like area, the concentrations of artifacts dip deeply into the subsoil, and are covered by thick, very black and very heavy-textured clay layers, which originally were considered more recent colluvial layers. They contain small fragments of pottery and house rubble. Unfortunately, however, no clear buried Ah (humic) horizon of the original landscape has been found, either because of erosion of the original surface or the enormous biological activity that has disturbed all original structures. Also, on the "new" surface to the north of the tell-like area, any sign of the presence of artifacts from the Vin'a culture is lacking. The soils on this younger levee are much more shallowly developed and seem to be younger than those of the tell-like area. The overall conclusion is that the prehistoric inhabi- tants settled in a fluviatile landscape which was much different from the present one. After the settlement was abandoned, the landscape was totally changed by river activity. The foot of the tell-like area was covered by new river sediment while the river was rapidly shifting its bed into the present river valley. Analysis of Materials The materials recovered during the 1983 and 1984 excavations are categorized in Table 1. A system of recording artifact attributes by computer was used in 1983-84 based on that used at Selevac and Gomolava in Yugoslavia, and Aldenhovener Platte in Germany. Ceramics (Timothy Kaiser, Peter Stehli) The ceramic technological aspects of sherds (fabric, firing, etc.) are recorded separately from the typological aspects of "diagnostic" sherds. Of the total ceramic as- semblage, 19.4% (4,803 sherds) has been analyzed for its technological and typological aspects. Microscopic examination of the diagnostic sherd sam- ples showed relatively little variability in the clay matrix. Typically, the clay body contains very fine-grained, silt- sized quartz accessories as well as numerous flakes of mica, which are normally larger than the quartz. This composition is superficially similar to that of certain soil horizons at the site, where fluvial deposits have thor- oughly mixed loess, clay, and sand. The question of whether the loess or the clay-rich chernozems at the site were used by the Opovo potters is at present under investigation by means of neutron activation analysis at the University of Toronto (T. Kaiser). Four main fabric types were observed; the presence or absence of various inclusions was the basic classifi- catory criterion. The types are designated as Sherd Tem- per, No Temper, Multilithic Sand (MLS), Chaff Temper, and Crushed Rock. Most vessels were made of sherd- tempered clay (60%); the next largest fabric category is No Temper (33%), followed by Multilithic Sand and Crushed Rock (each category 3%) and Chaff (1%). There is a good correlation between fabric type and vessel shape at Opovo (FIG. 10). As is customary at late Vinia sites, sherd-tempered vessels at Opovo are usually thick-walled large vessels such as jars, necked jars, and</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 12, 1985 437 Table 1.

It may be inferred that the Opovo potters employed crushed sherds as temper in recognition of their highly advantageous properties with respect to ther- mal shock. There is also a trend, however, towards the use of smaller-sized sherd particles in the tempering of some of the thinner-walled bowls. This is a characteristic not regularly encountered at other Vin'a sites. Untempered vessels are almost exclusively thin- walled, with the exception of certain open bowls and necked jars; these latter forms are usually highly polished and this may have been a factor in the decision not to use a tempering agent. Sand temper is rare and may represent the importation of pottery or the use of a clay source as yet undiscovered by us. Finally, the number of chaff-tempered sherds is also very low. Chaff temper is exclusively associated with large jar forms-some possibly fixed in their original positions, others of which were not, to judge from the presence of handles. Only those sherds with distinctive features (rim, base, shoulder, handle, etc.) can be studied by typological analysis. A type-variety system was established on the basis of types of the Vin'a culture already known from such sites as Vin'a, Selevac, and Gomolava, with input 100 C D Sherd Temper S 50t No Temper _ Multilithic Sand Temper o- O Chaff Temper TOTALS 1263 204 709 68 18 1 55.8/. 9 0/. 31 3/ 3 0/. 0 8 / 0 4 *.

Fabric and vessel shape association. from the hierarchical type-variety system created for the analysis of neolithic sherds in the Rhine valley by Stehli.17 The sherds and reconstructed vessels from excavation layer 3 comprise for the most part bowls, especially sharply biconical bowls and straight-sided bowls; they are frequently decorated by fine channelling of the upper shoulder. The typological analysis confirms the 1983 conclusion, that the ceramics of this building horizon at Opovo belong to the Vinia-Ploinik C2 phase (possibly also DI) with a certain amount of regional variation. Most unburned pottery at Opovo is black or grey, usually the result of smudging. A significant number of sherds are, however, the products of true reduction fir- ing; their chemical and mineralogical composition is at present being compared to that of the smudged sherds. Preliminary analyses of firing temperatures subsequent to the field season have been conducted on 10 represen- tative samples by means of the Thermal Expansion Mea- surement (T. Kaiser). On the basis of these analyses, it appears that the Opovo pottery was fired at somewhat lower temperatures than pottery at Selevac and Gomo- lava."8 The average firing temperature is ca. 8600 C. Untempered vessels seem to have been fired in the 800- 8400 range, while sherd-tempered vessels were fired in the 900-950' range. These results are quite tentative and will certainly be modified as additional samples are an- alyzed and as other techniques for determining firing temperature are employed. Figurines and Other Clay Artifacts Nonceramic clay artifacts excavated during the 1984 field season totaled 126, of which the majority were conical in form (ca. 6-10 cm in length) and perforated (possible clay weights), along with their fragments, and clay spheres of various sizes. Eight anthropomorphic figurines were found, including the large hollow "head" found in Feature 2. The number is less than usual for sites of the Vinia culture in this region (such as Potpor- anj). Moreover, the figurines have very little surface ornamentation, such as eyes and clothing. They are standing figurines with heads with pinched-out noses and a "bear-like" form (FIG. 11). Thus they are not typical of the Vinia-Ploinik C2/D1 phase, to which the ceramics 17. P.

Flaked-Stone Industry (William McCormack) The preliminary examination of the flaked-stone as- semblage from the 1984 season at Opovo combined macroscopic and microscopic observations for the material technology and utilization. Detailed use-wear analysis was done on one-third of the assemblage. The remainder was examined simply for the presence/ab- sence of wear. Other aspects of the industry that were examined include: typological character, size, raw ma- terial, technology, evidence of thermal alteration, evi- dence of hafting, resharpening and reuse, and breakage patterns. The Opovo industry can be characterized as a small- blade industry, made on very high quality, sometimes thermally-altered material, usually chert, opal, and chal- cedony. Numerically, the assemblage is quite small; only 180 artifacts were found during the 1984 season. Ty- pologically, the assemblage is only moderately diverse; only 10 tool types are represented, though these consti- tute a sizable proportion of the total assemblage (33%; n = 59). Similarly, utilized pieces are also quite nu- merous, comprising some 48% of the total. The inci- dence of cortex-bearing stone is remarkably low (24 of 180), suggesting that raw materials may have been ar- riving at the site in some kind of trimmed state, perhaps as shaped cores or even as blades already detached from their cores. The absence of debitage concentrations in the excavated portion of the site adds to this impression. Blade and flake lengths show that the majority of the whole artifacts are small, generally less than 30 mm in length, although in some instances they reach 66-70 mIm. The analysis of raw materials has been done in some detail with the object of generating data that will be of eventual use in sourcing studies. Raw materials from the site are of six kinds: obsidian, opal, chert, chalcedony, rhyolite, and radiolarite, with subdivisions of these. To date, sourcing has not been done on these raw materials, though from a review of the geological literature, and from discussions with the project geologists, it is appar- ent that the Opovo raw materials are from sources out- side the immediate region. The Opovo area, because of its rich loess and chernozem deposits, lacks bedrock outcroppings, the nearest major outcrops being in the Belgrade region (30 km to the south) and Fru'ka Gora (45 km to the NE). Both regions have deposits of chert and chalcedony and both would have been readily ac- cessible during the Middle Holocene by river transport and/or exchange. The obsidian comes from an even greater distance away-possibly from SE Slovakia or Romania, ca. 150 km distant. The rhyolite, also being an igneous rock, may come from one of these regions as well. The radiolarite, being a form of chert, is prob- ably from the Fruska Gora or the Belgrade area. The typology used in classifying the Opovo flaked- stone industry involves two major divisions: retouched artifacts and unretouched/modified artifacts. These in turn are subdivided into various technological and mor- phological classes. The retouched pieces from Opovo, in nearly every instance, are made on small, parallel- sided blades. Typologically, they comprise only 10 types (TABLE 2). The picture that emerges thus far from the technolog- ical data on the Opovo flaked-stone industry concerns five aspects of the systems of raw material acquisition and tool production. 1) The process of procurement involved the exploi- tation of stone from sources apparently 45 km away or greater. 2) If we may judge from the high quality of the material, extraction was a discriminating process. 3) By the time the stone arrived at the site it may have already been trimmed, a circumstance that would explain</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 12, 1985 439 Table 2.

A corollary is that tool production at the site centered on the later stages of manufacture: retouch, resharpening, and hafting. 4) For reasons that may relate to the distance the stone travelled and to the mode of its importation, little ma- terial appears to have actually reached the site. Related to the low quantities is the fact that the flaked stone was used judiciously, as is evidenced by the high incidence of retouch and reuse. 5) Concerning the patterns of consumption, there is evidence for intensive utilization of the artifacts. De- tailed examination of a sample of the utilized pieces indicates that many of the tools were involved in the cutting and boring of wood, while others, specifically the sickles, were used in the cutting of silica-rich plants such as grasses (possibly cereals) and perhaps reeds. Many of the tools show signs of hafting, as expected, given the small sizes of these pieces. Ground-Edge Tools (Barbara Voytek) A total of 83 ground-edge tools were examined from the Opovo 1983-1984 excavations. The raw materials of these tools are presented in Table 3. All the adzes, chisels, and other ground-edge tools from 1983-84 had been flaked and then ground on pro- gressively finer sandstones. Perhaps the best example was an adze of actinolite schist which had been polished in manufacture and then itself used as a polisher (perhaps on pottery), during which use it was polished even more finely on one surface. This object was found within Feature 2. It was the only example of an actinolite adze. One of the most interesting aspects of the assemblage is the total lack of waste products. The lack of trimming flakes, preforms, or other debitage suggests that either the tools were being produced away from the settlement or else in a special area or areas that have not been Table 3.

On the whole, the ground-edge tools had been inten- sively used and frequently resharpened and reused. Ca. 38.5% of the assemblage had been reground, reflaked, and then reground again, or reused/recycled as pounders or hammers. The only pieces of debitage uncovered were resharpening flakes, suggesting that only resharpening activities were associated with the houses. The most common tool type was the polished stone adze, although some examples had been reworked into pounders, hammers, etc. The adzes made of opaline chert and chalcedony had been made on flakes, while the metamorphic types were more aligned with the bed- ding planes of the original sedimentary rocks and thus tended to be flatter and thinner. The two basalt axes had been perforated most likely by a bone drill using sand as an abrasive. The heavy reuse and recycling of the ground-edge tools suggests that raw material was relatively scarce and carefully curated. The lack of production debitage may also reflect the fact that semi-finished adzes had been brought to the site and had been intensively used. Grindstones (Barbara Voytek) During the 1983 excavations, 80 grindstones and frag- ments were recovered from the humus layer. During the 1984 excavations at Opovo, 218 grindstones and grind- stone fragments were uncovered, mainly from within the concentrations of house rubble, including eight in the SE corner of Feature 3. In the analysis conducted at Opovo, these materials were examined in terms of their raw materials and evidence for their usage. The most common stone used for grinding activities was sandstone (55% of all pieces of grinding materials). Three general types of sandstone were discerned. The balance of the raw materials comprised volcanic (two types of gabbro; one fragment of andesite; one fragment of granite; pyroxenite; and dacite) and sedimentary rocks (coarse-grained limestone; a breccia; and an unknown clastic rock which appears usually in burnt form). Some of these rocks could be from the Fru'ka Gora, including the andesite and the limestone. The gabbro, however, does not appear to have a Fruska Gora context and thus could be Carpathian in origin, from the Vr~ac area. The sandstones could be either from the Fruika Gora or Vriac. The use of these grinding rocks was determined by studying the area of wear relative to the entire rock and the nature of the wear as seen both micro- and macro- scopically in terms of the condition of individual mineral grains. Because of the heavy deposits of calcium car- bonate on all grinding surfaces, it was impossible to consider any type of pollen wash or other test for organic remains. No evidence of grinding in terms of scratches could be determined on the stones that were not whet- stones. The grindstones from Opovo show little evidence of having been used in grinding wheat or other grains. The sandstone grindstones appear to have been used for sharpening tools of stone or bone in that the area of usage is invariably small and concave, as though a rep- etitious rubbing were involved rather than the crushing and grinding of grain. One large, flat stone which may have served as a quern in processing grains was made of the fine, loose sandstone which would have certainly produced grit in the ground product. It is unlikely that such a rock would have been used in the processing of foodstuffs. The hard, compact sandstone, however, is suitable for grinding grain, and it is possible that those rocks were used for grain processing. The other rocks are also problematic at this point. The gabbros may have been used in grinding grains. Their surfaces are invariably pecked, and they definitely in- curred some type of pounding, which may have involved grains or perhaps some harder foodstuff (e.g., nuts) or other materials to be used, for example, in pottery man- ufacture. Unlike the sandstone examples, the gabbro stones were never worn through. A mica-schist grind- stone was another example of a very flat surface, with no hint of concavity, but with a number of holes that probably preclude the possibility that a powdered sub- stance was sought. Faunal Remains (Nerissa Russell) During the 1984 field season, 2,385 fragments of bone were analyzed (TABLE 4). Of these, 1,391 were excavated in 1983, completing the analysis of the 2,546 bone frag- ments recovered in the first season of excavation. The 994 fragments analyzed from the 1984 season represent ca. one-third of the total bone excavated during the season. Close to one-third (676) of the 2,385 fragments was identified at least to the family level, and in most cases to genus or species. This is a fairly high proportion of identifiable bones, attesting to the good bone preserva- tion at this site. A high proportion of wild species is seen in the fauna analyzed both in 1983 and 1984, (TABLES 4, 5); 19 at least 62% of the identified fauna is wild, and the actual proportion is probably much higher. Many of the cattle and most of the pigs were probably 19. S.

Another striking feature of the Opovo bones is the relatively large number of human remains. Almost 15% of the identified fauna is human. Not all of these are positive identifications, however, as most are shaft frag- ments. There are 12 definitely human, 14 probably hu- man, and 72 possibly human bone fragments, in addition to the two human bones analyzed last year. It should be stressed that these human remains do not represent bur- ials, but isolated bones scattered in the midden. They are concentrated most heavily in the NW comer of Fea- ture 5, not all of which has been analyzed as yet. Many of these bones are burnt, but so are the animal bones from this area, so they are probably not the remains of a cremation. Additionally, the find of a human ulna with clear traces of gnawing in the 1983 analysis was supple- mented by four more human bones with possible gnaw marks in 1984.

The purpose of this mapping is to enable reconstruction of the original construction of the building as well as the nature of its collapse. At the same time, samples of the rubble from these features have been taken systematically to analyze the clay and temper composition of the rubble in different parts of the building, and in the different buildings, and the temperature of firing, in order to reconstruct the path of the fires, and the production sequence in the construction of the building. Finally, all the rubble from all features was weighed (total: 5,835 kg) in order to construct density maps of the relative amounts of rubble across this building ho- rizon in Block I. Conclusions of the 1984 Field Season The results of the architectural investigation must ob- viously await the analyses currently underway of the excavated data. Our preliminary conclusions, however, formed from impressions after the 1983-84 excavations, indicate that there are some significant differences be- tween the buildings of Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk and those of other Vin'a-Plo'nik settlements to the south. The buildings seem smaller and squarer than the usual Vin'a-Plo'nik buildings, but the future investigation of the substructural foundations will determine whether this impression is correct, or whether the excavated buildings were in fact longer. Another difference observed was the virtual absence of a burned clay floor under the rubble at Opovo, in contrast to the solid clay floors noted at most other Vin'a-Plo'nik sites such as Gomolava, Vin'a, Divostin, and Selevac. That is, the floor was not constructed in the usual manner of a layer of clay over- lying a wooden substructure. It was either made of wood, which rotted or burned, or else comprised a sim- ple, unprepared beaten earth surface. In this case, the burned or rotten organic materials have been subse- quently removed or rendered completely unidentifiable by the natural processes of soil formation and animal activity. It seems likely then that the Opovo buildings were built with unusually flimsy or fragile floors, which might suggest that the buildings were not so long-lived as those further south. On the other hand, at least in one building (Feature 2), the complexity of internal furniture in the form of partitions, oven, and storage features is as great as the other Vinia-Ploinik and SE European late neolithiclearly eneolithic buildings. Thus, from the architectural point of view, our obser- vations of 1983-84 suggest that,' although the houses were smaller and perhaps less permanent than those further south, they responded to the same needs for fixed division and apportionment of space as seen in other Vin'a houses. The superstructure was made of similar materials (A-horizon soil deposits, plus chaff and other organic materials) which were locally available, using reeds, wooden planks, and whole and split logs as the framework of the outer walls. The houses were destroyed by fires which may have started as separate fires in each case, since each building had its concentration of vitri- fied clay, from which, it is presumed, the fire spread to the rest of the building. Observations of other materials excavated in 1983-84 confirm the fact that there is a combination of charac- teristics that are typical of the Vin'a culture and others having sharp differences from the Vin'a culture. For example, in terms of settlement location, the pedological survey confirmed that the site was located on a small island surrounded by waterlogged or marshland areas which were rich in wild game and plants, but whose area of nearby agricultural soils was limited. This loca- tion is unusual for a Vin'a culture settlement and needs to be explained. The analysis of faunal remains confirmed an unusually high percentage of wild animals (including fish and birds), especially deer and pig, among the faunal re- mains. The study of the parts of body and sex/age ratios suggests that this reflects a real emphasis on hunting activities in the procurement of food at Opovo. The analysis of the relatively large number of grind- stones at Opovo shows that very few of them were made in materials suitable for grinding grain, nor do they show the resulting contact traces of this task. The majority was made of sandstone and was used for grinding and sharpening bone and stone tools. The others have traces of pounding rather than grinding. As yet, the flotation samples have not been analyzed for macrofloral remains in any detail, but their prelimi- nary examination shows a complete absence of grains of cultivated wheat or barley. Our dominant impression remains, therefore, that the subsistence activities at Opovo differed from all other Vin'a-Plocnik sites in focusing on the exploitation of wild resources, both plants and animals. Whether or not this was a seasonal activity has yet to be investigated. We should note, however, that accommodation for storage in the form of storage pots, and for food preparation in the form of ovens in the buildings, is identical to that in other Vinda- Plocnik sites. Overall, there are relatively few flaked- and polished- stone tools, particularly the former, and their fragments 20. G. Shaffer, "Neolithic Building Technology in Calabria, Italy," unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, SUNY, Binghamton (1984).</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 12, 1985 443 at the site. In late neolithic sites in SE Europe most flaked-stone tools are used as "sickles;" this is not at all the case at Opovo, where distally retouched blades used for scraping soft materials are the most frequent. It should be noted that in the two excavation seasons, not a single core has been excavated, and only one core fragment. The ground-stone tools have a similar absence of flaking debitage, and a high frequency of resharpening and reusing of the tools, linked with the high frequency of sandstone grinders. These observations on raw-material utilization point to a pattern of raw-material acquisition at Opovo that does not fit the usual late Vinia culture pattern of rich and easy acquisition of a variety of raw materials for specific tools and tasks. The materials were acquired from possibly quite distant sources, 30-45 km or more for the majority of materials, and over 100 km for the obsidian. These are not, however, unusual distances in raw-material procurement for Vin'a-Plocnik sites, many of which must have sacrificed proximity to raw-material sources in order to gain proximity to agricultural soils. It is the fact that all the tools seem to have been brought to Opovo in already finished form, and that careful steps were taken to prolong their use-lives, that is the unusual phenomenon. The materials used, however, are not of poor quality; they show the same discrimination in using special materials for special tasks that has been seen at other Vin'a-Plo'nik sites. The relatively high frequency of obsidian among the flaked-stone tools which was noted at Opovo has been found at other Vin'a-Plo'nik sites north of the Danube (for example, Vr'ac-At2). It is, however, more characteristic of the earlier phase of the Vin'a culture (Vin'a-Tordo'), for example, found at Potporanj. This reflects the north and northeasterly di- rection of the raw-material acquisition at these sites, towards the Carpathians and Fru'ka Gora. The dominant ground-stone tools are adzes, without shaft-holes, al- though some of the latter do occur on axes. Their forms and dimensions do not differ from the majority of those of Vin'a-Plo'nik sites of the lower Morava and middle Danube basins. The bone tools, on the other hand, show little variation from the pattern of bone tool manufacture and utilization seen at other Vin'a-Plo'nik sites, apart from a slightly lower overall frequency, and a higher frequency of antler as their raw material. Likewise, in the utilization of clay resources, specif- ically in the manufacture of ceramics, there is little difference in the technological process or in the form and decoration of the product which would distinguish the ceramics at Opovo from those of any other late Vinia sites (Vinia C2/D 1). On the basis of a preliminary ex- amination of the ceramics, local clays were used, and a very high percentage of the sherds (more than half) were tempered by reused crushed ceramics, which is charac teristic of other Vin'a-Plo'nik sites in the middle Danube basin (e.g., Vin'a and Gomolava). Clay was also used in the manufacture of various clay weights and balls, all of which are also characteristic in form, dimensions, and frequency of other Vin'a-Plo'nik sites. Figurines, both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, on the other hand, which usually occur in large numbers on Vin'a-Plo'nik sites, are unusually scarce in and around the houses of the final building horizon at Opovo, and have an unusual scarcity of surface decoration and elaboration. Their forms are more reminiscent of figu- rines of the very late Vin'a culture of the Morava basin, but this has no chronological significance in the case of Opovo. The dating of this site is firmly established by the close links with well-dated ceramic sequences of nearby Vin'a and Gomolava. Finally, the discovery in the 1984 field season of two tiny fragments of copper oxide has firmly established the links to the Vin'a-Plo'nik sites of the middle Danube and lower Morava valleys, and the exploitation of the copper ores to the south and east in the mountains of Eastern Serbia. Our overall impression, therefore, is that Opovo is a late neolithic/early eneolithic site which differs from the general pattern of SE European late neolithic/early eneo- lithic sites, including most of the late Vin'a culture sites, in its topographic location and in its pattern of subsis- tence and lithic raw-material acquisition. For the most part, the tools and artifacts manufactured out of the raw materials (including those of local materials such as bone and clay) are identical in formal characteristics. The settlement itself appears to have many of the complexi- ties, from the point of view of use of building materials and organization of space, of the late Vinca sites further south. And yet one constantly has the impression (not yet demonstrated) that the settlement was not as per- manently occupied as those further south. The model established at the beginning of the project was that at Opovo we should expect to see a settlement of agriculturalists whose use of resources reflects a pro- cess of social and economic transformation similar to that of other Vin'a settlements. Because of its location, it would be distinguished by an emphasis on the use of marshland resources and by a direction of acquisition to the north rather than to the south. After the 1984 season, it was clear that our model would have to change, since the differences and similarities between Opovo, north of the Danube, and those settlements already researched south of the Danube, turned out to be much more com- plex than at first we had imagined. The alternative models which may be set out after the</page><page sequence="20">444 Opovo: the Balkan Neolithic/Tringham, Brukner, and Voytek 1984 field season, and the test propositions pertinent to them, are the following. 1. Opovo represents a late neolithic/early eneolithic adaptation in the Tami' valley which is different from the Vin'a culture to the south but similar to that which resulted in the Tisza culture further north in the lower Tisza valley. Because the inhabitants of Opovo adopted features of the strong Tisza and Vinia cultures, there is, for some archaeologists, an apparent "cultural mel1ange" represented in the marshlands of the Tami'. In this case we would expect to see a long transfor- mation of the early neolithic mixed agriculturalists/ hunter-gatherers (the K6ors culture in this region) into the "Opovo manifestation" of the late neolithic/early eneolithic; we should expect to see such a manifestation developing at Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk from its earliest pe- riod of occupation, which is likely to be the time of the early Vin'a culture, Vin'a B , or its chronological equivalent. 2. Opovo represents one of a series of sites whose settlers originally came into this area from the south, from the heartland of the Vin'a culture (i.e., the Morava- Sava-Danube confluence area). We hypothesize two pos- sible mechanisms (although there may be many more) by which the marshlands of the Tamis-Tisza valley would have been settled in this way. a) The inhabitants of Opovo represent a bud-off group fissioned from an overgrown center, such as Vin'a itself, who established a permanent settlement in the marginal areas of the Tami' marshlands for reasons of demo- graphic, social, and/or economic pressure. b) Opovo was inhabited each year for a relatively short period by a population who normally lived in a large permanent settlement like Vin'a itself. It is hypothesized that the settlement would have served certain specialized purposes, such as the seasonal exploitation of red deer and wild pig herds in the Tami' marshlands, and/or the acquisition of raw materials from the Fruska Gora and Carpathian Banat via other groups who procured these materials directly. Many other forms of exchange could also take place at such a time. It is unlikely that such a movement to marginal lands would have started before the late Vin'a (Vin'a C1) culture, when the demographic, social, and economic transformations leading to such a fissioning-for mech- anism (a)--or task/settlement specialization and division of labor-for mechanism (b)-were taking place. The second model might explain some of the close ties that Opovo shows with the Vinia culture sites to the south in combination with a strong adaptation to certain local resources. It would also help to explain the exclu- sive presence of finished artifacts of nonlocal materials, since these would have been acquired at the central site and maintained at the work site (Opovo). What is more, this model has important implications for the transfor- mation of the large neolithic settlements into the smaller Early Bronze Age sites on marginal lands, in that we might be seeing here the earliest manifestations of this process.21 These two models form the basis of our subsequent research at Opovo-Ugar Bajbuk. So far we have inves- tigated only the final phase of occupation at Opovo. It is necessary now to examine evidence of the earlier occupation of Opovo. The testing of the models requires evidence for changes in site duration (from permanent to seasonal or vice versa), for changes in relations with the Vin'a culture settlements to the south and the Tisza culture settlements to the north, and for changes in the economic and social organization at the Opovo settle- ment itself. 21.
