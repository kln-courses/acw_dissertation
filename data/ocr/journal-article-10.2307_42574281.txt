<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT IS A VIABLE SYSTEM Î* ANATOL RAPOPORT IF general I were system to name theory, the most I would important name concepts two: system underlying and general system theory, I would name two: system and isomorphism. Both of these stem from older concepts. The philosophical ancestor of the system is the organism; the epistemological antecedent of isomorphism is analogy. Both of these older concepts have suffered setbacks during the era of impetuous development of exact science. Or, perhaps, it would be more accurate to say that the ways of thinking which put organism and analogy at the focus of attention suffered setbacks. In physics, the pre-galilean organismic view, in which teleology (i.e., goal-determined causality) was accepted, gave way to the mechanistic view, in which this concept of causality was rejected. Likewise, argument by analogy, which had been a fundamental device in pre-scientific philosophical discourse, was rejected in scientific discourse as inconclusive and fre- quently misleading. General system theory has, in my opinion, restored the concept of the organism and deduction by analogy via the concepts of system and of isomorphism. The system concept is the organism concept in modern garb; that is, the concept of organism made rigorous by appropriate operational defini- tions. One of the tasks of general system theory is to derive behavioral and evolutionary aspects of generalized organisms from rigorously defined system properties. In particular, the so-called goal-directed activities of inanimate systems (e.g., technological devices) have been shown to be derivable from their structural and relational characteristics; and so teleology * Presidential address delivered to thè annual meeting of the So- ciety for General Systems Research, December 29, 1965, at Berkeley, California. 463</page><page sequence="2">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIII, NO. 4 has been stripped of mystical or anthropomorphic features, which had made it unacceptable to the scientist. Similarly, analogy has been made rigorous in the form of the mathemati- cal isomorphism. For example, two mathematical models iso- morphic to each other are structurally identical even though they may refer to phenomena of widely different contents. Therefore it is legitimate to transfer the mathematical conse- quences of one model to the other. Such analogy is not "mere" analogy, disdained by rigorous scientists. It is logically com- pelling analogy. In short, what has been achieved is that scientific respecta- bility has been infused into the old notions of organism and analogy. It goes without saying that a complete rigorization of these notions can be achieved only in special cases. However, success in special situations raises the hope of success in more general situations. Once the possibility of rigorous definition of organism and analogy has been demonstrated, one feels somewhat more at ease speculating and making conjecture on the basis of organismic and analogical reasoning. That is so, of course, provided one is constantly aware of the tentative nature of such speculations and conjectures. If one offers them as hypotheses or proto-hypotheses, as food for thought or as intellectural challenges, always as potential questions never as answers or conclusions, one may, I feel, safely indulge in the pastime of extending the notions of system and iso- morphism to situations not yet rigorously analyzed. Conjectures so inspired may one day be rigorously validated. Accordingly, I have little misgiving in sharing with you my thoughts on the viability of systems, where by "viability" I shall mean some- thing much more general that the preservation of life, as it is conventionally understood, and where by a system I shall mean a diffusely generalized concept of an organism. Organisms with which we are most familiar are also those most clearly defined, which, incidentally, is what makes them familiar. We have no trouble recognizing dogs, cats, mosqui- toes, or storks. Nor do we have difficulty in deciding whether an organism of this sort is alive or dead. If we look at a more general class of living systems, which may also deserve to be 464</page><page sequence="3">DECEMBER 1966 WHAT IS A VIABLE SYSTEM? called organisms (or "orgs," as R. W. Gerard calls them), the problem of recognition becomes more difficult as does also the problem of distinguishing life from death. Take a sponge or a Portuguese man-of-war. Are these organisms or collections of organisms? In a way, they are both. Take a flatworm and cut it in two. The two halves are clearly alive and can re- generate into complete flatworms. But what has happened to the original flatworm? Is it alive or dead? Or take me (including the time dimension). During the course of my life every molecule in my body has been replaced several times. Are the cells of which my body was composed several years ago still the same cells? If one argues on the basis of the molecular turn-over that they are not, what has happened to the old cells? Are they all dead? If they are, can I say that I too have "died" several times? I know that this conclusion cannot be taken seriously by anyone, least of all by me; for I know directly that I am I and have continued to live since my birth. How do I know this? The only source of my knowledge is my memories. But my memories do not stretch to my birth. What evidence, then, remains for my assertion that I am today the "same" organism that I was at birth or, to put it in another way, that the organ- ism born fifty-four years ago is still alive? There is no escape from the conclusion that this assertion can be justified only by convention. It is so, because everybody says it is. We could just as easily have become accustomed to the idea that a man lives on in his children. And, of course, there are or have been people who have maintained just this. Nor is this idea a mere figure of speech. As every biologist knows, there is protoplasmic continuity between generations, which is as real as the protoplasmic continuity of the individual organism. IT organism seems, then, (which, that upon the reflection, identity and turn the out viability to be the of same an organism (which, upon reflection, turn out to be the same thing) become diffuse concepts, even on the level of clearly identifiable organisms. It should not be surprising, then, that these concepts become even more diffuse when applied to 465</page><page sequence="4">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIII, NO. 4 generalized organisms, such as ant hills, flocks, herds, symbiotic and ecological systems, families, organizations, communities, nations, and species. In all these instances it is difficult to decide (except when the system becomes extinct) whether it is still " itself" or has changed into something else, and, if so, whether this means that the old system has died and has been replaced by a new one. When an evolutionary line be- comes extinct, it stays extinct. The last species of that line is no longer a living system. But species evolve by adaptive specialization from more generalized species. What has hap- pened to the ancestor species of a species now alive? Are they still living in the younger species, or are they extinct? Such questions may not seem important. They may sound like pseudo-questions of the sort semanticists warn against. We shall see in a moment, however, that in a certain context such questions assume enormous importance and may be for many of us questions of life or death. I remember a high school teacher of ancient history, who insisted that we ignore 476 A.D. as the date of the fall of Rome. "Rome never fell/' he used to say. "If you don't believe me, go there and see. It's still there." Some years later I went to see, and it was there. I was still a very young man and had never heard of general system theory, but I remember wondering about the meaning and the import of my old eccentric teacher's remark. Rome was there in a way that Pompeii was not. Rome was alive, but Pompeii was dead. There was some dead tissue in Rome: the Colosseum, the Forum, and such; but there is dead tissue (like scar tissue) in all of us living organisms. However, the Rome of Mus- solini was not the Rome of Trajan - or was it? The empire was no more, to be sure; but this does not dispose of the argu- ment that the city of Rome had never died, nor even that she had completely changed her identity. We have no difficulty identifying the London of Elizabeth II with the London of Elizabeth I. Yet an empire, far surpassing the Roman empire in extent and power, had in the meantime come into existence around London as a nucleus and fallen apart. 466</page><page sequence="5">DECEMBER 1966 WHAT IS A VIABLE SYSTEM? Some ticist, twenty I then shared years the ago sophomoric when I became contempt a general of the seman- early ticist, I then shared the sophomoric contempt of the early general semanticists for "abstractions without identifiable ref- erents." At that time I would have dismissed the question of whether Rome was or was not the "same" city it was two thousand years ago as a pseudo-question. "First you have to define 'same/ " I would have said. "Then we shall look at the facts. The extensional facts will provide the answer in terms of our definition of 'same city/ Ontological argument will get us nowhere." This stance is unassailable, provided we remain indifferent about which definition of "same" we adopt. But what if the definition we choose profoundly affects our at- titudes and behavior? Appealing to the events on the molecular level, a general semanticist is likely to maintain with some vigor that Mr. X today is not the same person as Mr. X five years ago. But if this general semanticist happens to be a member of a jury when Mr. X is being tried for murder committed five years ago, this insight concerning the non-identity of X1965 and X1960 is not likely to make a difference in the verdict. On the other hand, we must admit that Mr. Y, the son of Mr. X, is in a very real sense a biological continuation of Mr. X. We do not punish Mr. Y on that account for a crime committed by Mr. X ; but in some societies sons were punished for the sins of their fathers. Repugnant as this practice seems to us, it is neither more nor less "logical" than punishing a man for what he did when, according to what we now know of the material constituents of organisms, he was by no means identical with his present self. Here identity is clearly a matter of social convention. Paradoxes of this sort may seem bizarre when we speak of human beings. They may seem intriguing but unimportant with respect to other species (for example, does the caterpillar "die" when a butterfly is "born"?). ITiere is one area, how- ever, where questions of continuity and identity are of supreme importance, namely when a system is a nation, a culture, or a society. Are we the same nation today that we were ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred and fifty years ago? The question is not an 467</page><page sequence="6">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIII, NO. 4 idle one, because regardless of our philosophical convictions, we are compelled to act and to think on the premise that we are the "same" nation. A century ago a civil war was fought presumably to keep the nation the "same." We are all taught that the Union cause was won. However, aside from symbolic trappings, what was the system which was supposedly pre- served? Please note, I am not challenging the conventional view of history, which identifies systems by the way people refer to them. Rather I am merely raising the question of what it means to preserve a system when the distinction between continuity and discontinuity, between life and death of a sys- tem, if you will, is nowhere as clear as in the case of an individual living organism. This are constantly question made cannot on be us shrugged to act in off, accordance because demands with the are constantly made on us to act in accordance with the goals of preserving this or that nation, social system, culture, or, in the old days, a set of religious beliefs or, in not so old days, a supposed racial entity. Indeed, we are asked or commanded to destroy some systems, or to condone their destruction, supposedly to keep other systems viable. The ethical dilemmas posed by such demands are well known. Is killing in war compatible with the prohibitions against mur- der? Is it justifiable to break treaties freely entered into in order to serve the "national interest"? Is it permissible in all cases without exception to carry out the orders of a legal authority in violation of one's conscience? These are old ques- tions, and they are not central to my theme. The central issue is this: the ultimate ethical imperative of whatever content can always be reduced to the imperative of insuring either the viability of some system or of its destruction. Let us therefore look further into this matter. The clearest cases are those where the continuity of an individual life is involved, simply because, of all systems ex- isting in the natural state, the living individual organism is the most clearly identifiable, and the question of continunity is most easily decided with reference to the individual. We know, however, that neither the life of an individual nor, by exten- 468</page><page sequence="7">DECEMBER 1966 WHAT IS A VIABLE SYSTEM? sion, his well being are, as a rule, the over-riding factors in large scale ethical imperatives; that is, those involving collec- tive social action. Here the "viability" of other kinds of systems takes precedence in decisions, which become binding on all individuals subject to social constraints (and this means all of us) . The question I am raising is not, I repeat, the old ethical question of whether enhancing the viability of one system is preferable to enhancing the viability of another. Rather I am asking two other questions: (1) What is the system which in some particular instance we are urged to keep viable? (2) l Vili the acts which we are urged to perform actually contribute to the viability of the system in question? The answers given to such questions by the ruling elites (i.e., the guardians of large social systems) are typically re- iterations of platitudes and homilies. Those whose business it is to organize, manipulate, and direct mass behavior have learned well the cardinal principle of mass advertising and campaign politics: name recognition. "A recent Gallup Poll/' says the New York Herald Tribune (editorial, September 30, 1965), "brought out once again one of the more dismaying aspects of American political life; the extent to which the electorate does not know what it is voting for; and, as a corollary, the importance of mere recognition in a political campaign." The editorial goes on to quote an article in Fortune : ". . . most political experts believe that something they call 'name recognition' is the decisive factor in a great many elections. A significant number of voters apparently place their X beside the first name they recognize on the ballot." Helen Mears in a recent article in Liberation (December, 1965) goes on to draw conclusions which neither the Herald Tribune nor Fortune have dared to draw. If, in general, in domestic affairs we "do not know what we are voting for" (as the Gallup Poll indicated), it is certainly even more true that in supporting war in Viet- nam we do not know what we are voting for. The same Gallup Poll reported that not only are we ignorant of 469</page><page sequence="8">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIII, NO. 4 issues, but we are ignorant about who our political leaders are unless their names have been sold to us by massive propaganda. For instance the poll found that of the reg- istered Republicans examined, some twenty-one per cent did not know anything about Richard Nixon although he had been a Republican Vice-President for eight years, the party's Presidential nominee in I960, and a leading con- tender in 1964. Fifty-two per cent did not know anything about Governor Romney. What then would these same people be likely to know about Asian political leaders, their domestic policies, or their foreign-policy aims? We know only that their "name" is Communism - and Communism is "the enemy of everything we hold dear." What do most of us know about Communism as a way of organizing society? Only that it "enslaves" its people and "destroys human dignity." What do we know of Communist goals? Only that "Com- munism" intends "to conquer the world" and "enslave us all." This "freedom," is not to "civilization," say that abstractions "communism," like "national "national interest," libera- "freedom," "civilization," "communism," "national libera- tion ," and the like, are devoid of meaning. On the contrary, these rallying signals are fraught with meaning in the very real sense of serving as categorical and effective commands in the performance of vastly complex and superbly organized col- lective acts. Nevertheless, the exhortations built around these signals remain platitudes as long as the actual functional struc- ture of the systems to be preserved or destroyed are not re- vealed. For the most part, I suspect, the ruling elites them- selves are not aware of what it is that is to be preserved or destroyed, much less of whether the actions undertaken serye the supposed aims. As I said, years ago I was attracted to a point of view called general semantics in which the central epistemologica! tenet is stated so: "Structure is the only content of knowledge." This statement was meant as a warning. We tend to identify knowledge with the recognition of names . This is the episte- mology of magic. If we are somewhat more sophisticated, we 470</page><page sequence="9">DECEMBER 1966 WHAT IS A VIABLE SYSTEM? tend to identify knowledge with the recognition of classes de- fined by properties . This is the aristotelian epistemology. Al- fred Korzybski called general semantics a non-aristotelian sys- tem, because it amounted to a rejection of the classes-arid - properties epistemology in favor of a structural epistemology where not intrinsic properties of entities but relations among entities are at the center of interest. Korzybski emphasized the negation of aristotelian identity. To him, nothing was identical with anything, not even with itself, because reality is a process, not a collection of objects. But, of course, this rejection of identity is not sufficient for an epistemology. In fact, an epistemology is, in a sense, a definition of identity. Accordingly, the general system theorist defines identity by structural isomorphism, including the dyna- mic aspects of structure, i.e., the law of system behavior and of system evolution. Thus the invariants of system properties become the identifying characteristics of a system. Depending on the invariants which we happen to single out for attention, we decide the question of system identity, in particular of sys- tem continuity and, in the case of living systems, of system viability. Thus, my identity as a living organism is a fact because of the aspects of my behavior which remain invariant in spite of the changes constantly occurring in me, not because people continue to call me Rapoport. Similarly, the continuity of the United States is a fact to the extent that structural invariants residing in the United States as a system can be actually ex- hibited, not because of the way the flag looks. The same applies to all other "abstractions" which serve as rallying signals for collective action. To "survive" means to preserve some invariants of struc- ture and behavior. Meaning, therefore, can be assigned to the exhortations to kill and to destroy in the name of survival only if the invariants supposedly defended are described struc- turally and dynamically, not simply named. Moreover, the meaning of "survival" itself becomes highly ambivalent if structural analysis is pursued far enough, for the survival of a system is by no means always enhanced by the survival of 471</page><page sequence="10">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIII, NO. 4 its subsystems nor by the survival of the supra-system in which it is imbedded. Cells must die if the organism is to survive. Organisms must die if a species is to survive. This fact of life is always invoked as justification for sacrifice, most commonly in war. What is lost sight of in this argument is that systems in conflict are themselves imbedded in a supra-system without which they cannot survive. TO seems shift to be to admirably another context adapted for to a "survive" moment, in a competition cancer cell seems to be admirably adapted to "survive" in competition with the other cells of the body and, indeed, to insure the vigorous procreation of its kind. But cancer cells eventually kill the body in which they live and must then themselves die. What the cancer cell does not "know" is that the viability of a cell of a metazoon depends crucially on the viability of the supra-system in which it is imbedded. In destroying the supra- system, it destroys itself. The ruling elite of a militarily powerful state may decide that it is in the national interest to scrap its treaty obligations, and for a while may enjoy immunity by intimidating other states. But in doing so, the nation state is likely to destroy a supra-system of collective security (which may have depended on those very treaties) and so prepare its own eventual de- struction. Again, I insist, that with reference to a system like a nation state, it is not clear what is meant by its "survival." Names and slogans confuse the issue. Is the U.S.S.R. a con- tinuation of Russia, or has imperial Russia died? Is imperial Germany still alive in the divided Germany of today? After having effectively declared its treaty obligations to be scraps of paper (by deeds, not words), is the United States of 1965 the same nation which in pre-Cold War days was venerated by the common people of the whole world as a champion of peace and freedom? And if this question is dismissed as unim- portant on the grounds that we live in a world not of our making, and are threatened by evil powers, then let me put another question. In identifying our national interest with our ability to intimidate others, what are we doing to the supra- 472</page><page sequence="11">DECEMBER 1966 WHAT IS A VIABLE SYSTEM? system which we once helped to create in the pursuit of our national interest? The the United newly sparked Nations hope (largely that the our Clausewitzian creation) represented world of the newly sparked hope that the Clausewitzian world of Great Powers vying with each other for power was to be finally abolished. The United Nations was to perform an anti-carci- nogenic function in the community of nations, and to this function our ruling elite still pays lip service. What has been forgotten is that any nation can become a cancerous threat to the human race by taking the law into its own iron fists and by declaring itself to be the guardian of virtue. This has hap- pened time and again. Only the name of the virtue to be preserved kept changing (because the previous name invariably became associated wih carnage and hypocrisy). Genocide has been perpetrated in the name of the True Faith, the White Man's Burden, Kultur, Democracy, the World Working Class, the Purity of the Nordic Race. To me, it seems that it now has started in earnest in the name of the Great Society. I believe we have scrapped our obligations under the United Nations Charter, the solemn pledge to honor the Geneva Accord of 1954, and of the Organization of American States charter. I wonder whether we are not now in the position of all the other systems which go through a spurt of rapid expan- sion just before their demise - like populations of cancer cells ; like the terrible lizards of the mesozoic era, who got to be the biggest and the strongest just before they suddenly found them- selves extinct; like the obese who are well protected against starvation but who succumb to the fatty degeneration of the heart; like all the empires, which were destroyed by their own alienated masses. I wonder whether in our primitive conception of viability as competitive potential, we are ignoring the fact that, while the average life span of a mammalian species is about 20,000 years and that of a bird species about 40,000 years, the ants have been around for 40 million years, and the cockroaches still longer. The Jews have outlived most of their persecutors ; the Catholic Church has lived longer than any nation or empire 473</page><page sequence="12">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXUI, NO. 4 and is now probably preparing for its further survival by a stand against genocide on which the Great Powers are relying as an instrument of survival. From these examples we see, first, that survival potential has no discernible relation to what is conventionally seen as "strength0 or "security," and second, that survival potential has no necessary relation to the quality of existence. After all, who wants to be a cockroach? I am Pushkin's reminded short of novel, a story The which Captain's Pugachev Daughter tells Griniov Pugachev in Pushkin's short novel, The Captain's Daughter . Pugachev is a leader of a peasant-cossack uprising in 18th century Russia, and Griniov is a tsarist officer. Because of certain fortuitous circumstances, a warm, human relationship has been established between the two. "The Eagle asks the Raven," so goes the story, "why the Raven lives for three hundred years, while he, the Eagle, lives only thirty-three. 'This is because,' the Raven replies, you eat living flesh and I eat only carrion.' The Eagle decides to follow the Raven's example. They see a dead horse and fall to. 'No,' says the Eagle after a few pecks. 'I guess I would rather live thirty-three years on living flesh than three hundred years on this.' " This story is told by Pugachev in rebuttal to Gri- niov's warning that Pugachev's career will be a short one. However, Griniov's reply is equally thought-provoking: "A clever tale," he says to Pugachev. "But to my way of thinking, to live by murder and pillage is to live on carrion." From all this we ought to conclude that two questions are of the most vital practical and ethical significance: 1. What makes a system viable? 2. What systems deserve to be kept viable? Answers to these questions are neither obvious nor simple. 474</page></plain_text>
