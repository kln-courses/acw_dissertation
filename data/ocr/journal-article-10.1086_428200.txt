      <p>The author begins with a tale of an animal liberationist’s bomb, and sets out to sweep away what he sees as overly romantic ideas about animal minds. Among his targets for criticism are scientists Sue Savage‐Rumbaugh, Frans de Waal, and the late Donald Griffin, and nonscientists such as philosopher Peter Singer and lawyer Steven Wise. Wynne seeks to bring to a popular audience the message that the ways animals are not like us are far more significant than the ways in which they are like us.</p>
      <p>Wynne’s enthusiasm for animals is palpable when he describes the adaptations that underlie honeybee communication, bat echolocation, pigeon homing, and suitability of dolphins for marine life. He argues compellingly that these exquisite adaptations provide reasons to value and preserve animals for their own sake. He sees no point in getting entangled in questions about animal consciousness. The author admits to not understanding how philosophers think about these issues, but that does not stop him from having an opinion on what the philosophers should think. Wynne seems similarly out of his depth in the final chapter, which critiques efforts to extend legal rights and protections to animals and ends with another reference to bombs.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Do Animals Think?</italic> is written in a polemical tone. For example, Wynne accuses de Waal of having “badly misunderstood the methods of science” (p 167)—a serious charge to bring against another scientist. Unfortunately, his attack is based on a superficial and incorrect reading of de Waal’s volume, <italic>The Ape and the Sushi Master: Cultural Reflections by a Primatologist</italic> (2001. New York: Basic Books). Like most polemicists, Wynne lapses here and elsewhere into attacking straw men.</p>
      <p>Although it does contain some interesting information about animals, and raises some legitimate criticisms of those who wish to emphasize similarities more than differences, the book is too polemical for teaching purposes. Nevertheless, I suspect that it will make its way onto undergraduate syllabi among the considerable reservoir of psychologists who share Wynne’s disdain for the authors he targets. They will see the volume as a corrective for the excessive anthropomorphism that their students have absorbed from watching too many television specials about animal behavior. Perhaps students need the palliative, but we should prefer a more balanced approach to the debate about animal minds and our ethical responsibilities.</p>
