<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEFENCE OF POETRY Raoul Schrott Back to the Mediterranean. Ladies and gentlemen, honourable members of the jury: permit me to preface my plea with a review of the three-thousand-year history of the case hereunder submitted to the Court of Fourth Instance. My aim in so doing is to demonstrate with what malice the indictment is laid, and with what extreme measure of spite, prejudice and ignorance it is drafted. The court is invited to observe how the complaint has focused on varying aspects of the case with each successive appeal. I submit that such circumstance alone will indicate that my learned colleagues have been intent on abusing these proceedings for the purpose of what can only be termed a show-trial! Yes - you have understood me correctly! For literary criticism always begins with the desire to see poetry abolished, and with it my client - whom I consider it my great honour to represent before this court. The trial in the first instance was characterised by the attempt of Plato, recently called to the bar at that time, to gain in distinction by accusing my client of wilful fraud. According to Plato the meaning of life lay in searching for eternal truth, while my client's poetry offered but imitations of imitations. In his arraignment Plato submitted that poetry was a phantom art: while each thing - a tree, for instance - had an ideal form somewhere in heaven, which not even the best of gardeners could cultivate to perfection, the poet could proffer but a third-hand imitation - consisting of nothing but words. Instead of using words responsibly, however, he manipulated them for the attainment of mere effect. He was thus charged with interfering with the roots of language - by swapping letters: the rootless poet became quite footless mixing his 'g's and 't's, fancy free to traduce the ideal tree to a tree-tease in verse, a curse, and no treat for the reader either. This, according to my learned colleague, constituted reasonable evidence that a poet's lies were contagion to the life of the mind, at the very best turning men into children, at the worst, into women. Plato therefore sought the highest penalty, demanding that my client be prohibited from practising his profession and banished from the Republic, and that his works be publicly burned. The jury of the day acquitted the defendant in default of evidence - but 32</page><page sequence="2">IRISH PAGES the prosecution saw fit to lodge an appeal. My client, filing one motion after another, was nonetheless able to stand his ground, and, despite subjection to pressure for centuries and considerable loss of custom, was able to compose a number of startling works. He was not read by many even then, for the common reader was at that time not exactly common - and without the patronage of a Maecenas to fall back on, he was mostly down on his uppers. The difficulty of the situation was compounded by the perennial constraint of seeking some arrangement with the powers-that-be, effectively making him dependent on the political and religious authorities of his age. Take, for example, the republican propaganda he was obliged to disseminate in his Aeneid, or again, the virtuous lip-service he has paid to Christianity, whether in the Marian songs of his courtly love poetry, or the Divina commedia. But then came a change of venue: England, 1595; the next major trial was set to commence. The defendant was represented on this occasion by the senior partner of my firm, Sir Philip Sidney. The complaint that my client had done nothing but spread lies had been re-filed, but on this occasion prosecution had refrained from demanding he be banished from society for behaviour injurious to the interests of the state, on the grounds that his profession must be construed too ineffectual to constitute a cultural intervention of any kind, whether negative or positive. Prosecution counsel, a small-minded Puritan by the name of Gosson, noticed, albeit at the eleventh hour, that his argument must, nolens volens, lead to the suspension of proceedings. In desperation he chose to play his joker, claiming that my client was guilty in his poetry of the manufacture and distribution of pornography, and I quote: "infecting us with many pestilent desires ... training [men's wit] to wanton sinfulness and lustful love."The fact that this change of strategy, by attributing subversive force to the ineffectual, was in itself contradictory, was of secondary importance. Demanding a verdict was now the least of my learned colleague's concerns; his attentions were directed solely towards ridiculing the defendant in the eyes of society, discrediting him morally. It was, in brief, pure slander. We gave short shrift to the allegation of obscenity, arguing that it was not poetry which "abuseth man's wit," but that "man's wit abuseth Poetry" - by reading it for its erotic content only. As for that Sword of Damocles forever suspended over our heads in the shape of the count that poetry is without truth and useless, our defence at that time was built on the premise that poetry makes no claim to be factual; that the poet "nothing affirmes, and therefore never lyeth"; that the poet "is not labouring to tell you, what is or is not, but what should or should not be." Returning then to the metaphor of the tree: the poet should be thought of as a gardener sowing the seeds of the possible in the 33</page><page sequence="3">IRISH PAGES bed of reality, cultivating the image of goodness in the minds of his readers. In this way - and here we have little choice but to extend the analogy with the imaginative restraint imposed by prolonged practise at the bar - thinking about a tree may eventually lead us to define its radical index, which in turn could prompt extraction of both its square and its cubic roots, so that before we know it we may be accelerating through space on said tree-tease, branching into light solids, twigging nano-technological plant, spreading into orbital habitats. Gasps of surprise - followed by the slow crescendo of courtroom applause ... We managed to demonstrate at the time that under the didactic imperative comprehending all imagination the ancient Greek Eikastike - "figuring forth good things," according to contemporary etymologists - and the more dissolute Phantastike had, like oratio and ratio, language and reason, entered an alliance of their own. Thus the poem could become a "speaking picture," allowing us insights that were entirely novel, or unheard of - epiphanies, proverbial in their transfiguring power. For poetry's use value consisted in its being "the most efficient persuasive force available to human beings." Visible signs of assent on the part of the jury - diminishing now that new questions are mooted as to the actual purpose of poetry. The poet - we took time to explain - was the only mortal whose imagination allowed him access to the various ideals of society. He alone had the strength and the opportunity to portray these in an admirable light for the benefit of his fellow citizens - thereby bringing to the stage a figure who incorporated in his person the ideal intellectual, the ideal politician, the very genius of the age. Virtually speaking, all these qualities were combined in his work. By this time, we had the jury well on our side. Dame Fortune too, it seemed. For luckily there had been no need to go into my client's personal preferences - in the pursuit of such noble ends - for the manifold masks, disguises and artful gimmicks of coquetry, nor to admit that this meant he was not infrequently taken for some ham actor, dandy or pimp, rather than for the philosopher, soldier and lover he claimed to be. But take a look for yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury! Ecce homo: the defendant! Not much left of the grandeur of yesteryear, is there! Not a flicker of fashion about him: his stand-up collar and starched shirt-front look as out of place today as that waxed moustache, those sandals or tartan trousers, the tweed jacket, or the Borsalino under which he imagines he can conceal his thinning, sandy hair. I am perfectly aware, ladies and gentlemen, that he does not create an especially favourable impression, and that the expression of dyspeptic melancholy that has replaced his previously arrogant 34</page><page sequence="4">IRISH PAGES manner does not render him any the more sympathetic. This, however, can scarcely be attributed to the intervention of the public prosecutor - himself, incidentally, my client's former colleague - when my client was summonsed some thirty years ago to the Court of the Third Instance to attend the most recent trial to date. On that occasion my learned colleague referred to the defendant as a decadent petty-bourgeois, a purveyor of make-believe, with nothing to say for himself and no real interest in changing society. Suddenly a conversation about trees was almost a crime, and even a rhyme was reactionary. And poetry was to be agitprop or nothing! But the greater the enemy, the greater the honour! - as we have already noted. For we were able to dismiss these charges no less elegantly than the earlier actions brought against us, my client this time employing the ruse of simply falling in with them on all counts, penning the required left-wing verse under the pseudonym Pablo Neruda. Until the day came when people grew weary of its leftishness, and my client was once again permitted to display his real talents. 0, yes, my client is ever the opportunist! No harm in admitting that! If we still look somewhat perplexed, however, it is because having first been dubbed "Junge Wilde" and then "yesterday's people," after being vilified as anarchists, demagogues and pornographers, after being asked to prove the truth of our work and after being taken to task for its uselessness, after all that and all that - people now seem to think they can simply ignore us. They declare us mentally unfit. As evidence they point out that we have lost the majority of our audience and all of the social standing we once had; and that these days not even the most trivial broadsheet rag considers us worth the mention. And this, they submit, is our last ditch manoeuvre: instigating a trial in the hope of finding someone to listen to a defence speech. Admittedly, my client has not always been his own best friend in these matters. I volunteer to submit that we should not be standing here today had his vanity been marginally less, and his inclination to recognize the many illegitimate offspring he has fathered in the course of his chequered career had been marginally greater. Think whom we might summons to testify on his behalf - George Brassens and Jacques Brel, Fabrizio de Andrei and Ivano Fossati, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso, Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith and Bob Dylan ... indeed even the most commercial pop-singers, the chansonniers and hip-hop artistes - especially the latter, since their occupation is nothing but poetry in the classical Greek sense. Even bestseller authors and novelists, headliners and copywriters, all of them cashing in on the high art inherited by my client, treading it underfoot, twisting it this way and that, until it fits their own requirements. Which, on beginning his own career, was exactly what my 35</page><page sequence="5">IRISH PAGES client did. He is simply too vain to admit it. And it is here we draw close to the root of the problem, one which - I beg leave to submit - has been overlooked in all the course of our three thousand- year-old proceedings. For the divers complaints brought against my client have derived solely from the fact that he fell foul of a media revolution which drowned the Mediterranean poetic legacy in a whirlpool of oblivion, stranding my client as a living anachronism. The only question remaining is whether his work therewith forfeited its truth and use value. The German word Dichtung (poetry) derives from diktion, the diction that defines all poetry, its characteristic manner of verbal expression in creating "speaking pictures". However, the technical resources available to diction of this kind - figures of thought such as the metaphor and simile, as well as acoustic figures, like metre and rhyme - were developed to fulfil a single, distinctive purpose: to make information memorable; to pass on knowledge from one generation to the next; by using standardized musical forms in language to create the only existing mnemonic system (perhaps the respected members of the jury would oblige by attempting to speak the text of a song without humming the tune ...); by using set phrases and portmanteau expressions (Homer's "cunning Odysseus," for example, or our "dear God"); by lending trenchant characterisation to things by means of visually suggestive comparisons ("rosy-fingered Eos"); by then synchronising sound-track and visuals to produce a cinema of the mind, comprising newsreel as well as entertainment, sweeping historical romance and educational documentary, propaganda and moral edification; through which facts, circumstances and values could be passed down, making culture possible in the first place. It was for this purpose alone that poetry had been invented. To this end too had it generated the stock formulae that constituted a language transcending time. The traditions on which it was able to draw in so doing were far older than the few millennia in which it had assumed a literary form. But this was precisely the crux of our problem. For it was with the invention of the alphabet that poetry had suddenly lost its function and raison d'&amp;tre.The advent of script meant the formulaic language of poetry was no longer essential to the transmission of information, and that ideas and facts could be recorded in writing without prior transformation in the matrix of poetry. The advantage was that entire fields of knowledge, including the natural sciences, philosophy and the Law, became emancipated from the constraints of poetry, and established themselves as autonomous disciplines - for their material could now be directly set down in writing. New poetic genres were born of this development too, like drama, whose actors could now record everyday speech. 36</page><page sequence="6">IRISH PAGES The disadvantage was that the inventory of poetry suddenly seemed superfluous. Poetry has never wholly overcome the loss of its central function, which, incidentally, was also the beginning of all its trials, of all the proceedings brought against us. It was tantamount to our expulsion from Paradise. Plato had already indicated as much by giving to poets their new name. By nature inclined to nostalgic retrospection he had lamented the demise of the ancient Aoides - the singers, seers and prophets invested by the gods and history - whose tasks had given them a monopoly on the transmission of culture. Following the revolutionary introduction of writing, however, a reversal no less radical than that of the later computer age, the Aoides were transmogrified as "poets," godless "makers," puffed up artisans of the language, barking phrasemongers and two-bit verbicides. Who had forfeited all authority, all auctorial significance, and had mutated as mere "authors". Thereby losing their last vestige of authenticity. Having ascertained the state of the facts - revered members of the jury - we shall now proceed to our defence. In which we shall table evidence to the effect that the conduct of the defendant, notwithstanding circumstantial evidence to the contrary, has been without blemish - but that his profession, given the magnitude of the upheavals already referred to, must henceforth be judged in a different light. For what has remained intact of the original character of oral poetry, an art form that was probably many thousands of years old? Very little. What has survived is mainly the enjoyment we experience in listening to a poem, whether in the discretion of one's own language, the distinctness of a foreign language, or in sound poetry. It is something that inhabits the quality metrical language owes to music: a communal experience that seems to unite reciter and audience, their breathing and heart frequency synchronized by the regular pitch of the verses. An experience in which bookish words reclaim their archaic corporeality. Giving rise to a form of communication that once was peculiar to oral poetry, whose origins, we remember, lay in the service it once performed to religion. An experience, in other words, in which communication becomes communion. If the truth of this development largely escapes the scrutiny of reason, the same cannot be said for its methods. For therein survives its persuasive force, harnessed to this day by political demagogue and advertiser's copywriter alike, or by all who seek, through the insinuations of verbal euphony, to sell a message which they intend to remain sacrosanct. However, this does not explain why the propensity of such brainwashing to engender conflict should be a matter of concern in respect of religion, the 37</page><page sequence="7">IRISH PAGES economy or populist politics, but not of poetry. The reason is that poetic devices are plundered by the former to a clearly defined and commonly intelligible end, while poetry, on the other hand, seems to have become an end in itself. It is therefore essential, esteemed members of the jury, that we elucidate the matter of its authorization. Authority was once conferred upon oral poetry by the ruler who praised it, the gods it celebrated, the audience it sought to entertain, and the knowledge it transmitted - on the condition that it remained no less subordinate than Adam and Eve in the Garden of Paradise. With the advent of writing, however, which he soon adopted for his profession, my client bit into the bitter apple (as the Germans say) and ate (if I may be permitted to use this motif one last time) from the Tree of Knowledge, that is: self-knowledge. Henceforth he became his own legislator.The Muses no longer gave authority to his poems, as they always had done in the past, nor sanctioned his enthusiasm as "possessed by a god". Instead, he was henceforth forced to find his own justification for what he produced. With newly acquired literacy, however, poetry also forfeited its unequivocal status. Not only because, as Plato complained, writing was open to interpretation, consisting merely of words and lacking entirely in the facility to register intonation, facial expression, or gesture, which were what actually showed what people meant. No, for besides growing in ambiguity in this way poetry had also declined in universal comprehensibility and accessibility. Whereas the epic extemporizing of oral poetry, with its concise items of information, its generalized formulae and continuous repetition had taken the short attention spans of its listeners into consideration, poetry was now confronted with readers. For whom the poem was a visual as well as a limited entity. To be read as often as one wanted. This was the beginning of the "text" - whose ever denser weft and warp became transparent only on repeated reading. But it was here too that poetry took leave of its wider audience. For the members of the latter were generally more interested in the "cinema of the mind" - that is, in the film itself - than in the constitution of the screen. As you can see, we are apt to deal with the defendant a good deal more severely than any prosecuting counsel preceding us. And this, in order finally to foreground what makes poetry unique and inimitable. Thereby to prove the truth of its case at last. The more poetry was made for paper, pen and the discerning reader, the less important became all those redundant factors that were dependent on memory, recitation and listeners: instead verse became more concise, and more complex. But this had yet another effect: for having lost its function as the significant medium, poetry had no alternative but to make a subject of 38</page><page sequence="8">IRISH PAGES itself. It now began to focus its gaze on its own rules and resources. The most important of these is probably the metaphor. In the words of that most ancient of our colleagues, Aristotle, who defended poetry against Plato: "the greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor. This alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of genius, for to make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances." The value of poetry has come to lie in its ability to turn analogy into its central concern. While metaphor had previously been little more than a device to outline things in more trenchant terms, it now became a faculty of the understanding. With its own use value: for every invention or discovery can be traced to the aha-experience of Archimedes in his bathtub, to the insight that one thing is like another. It is this principle of resemblances that drives the think-tanks and creative studios, the leading edges of science and technology, even providing the basis of wine criticism (or have you ever read a gourmet columnist writing of wine that tastes of grapes?). But it goes further than that: in fact, this x=y mechanism is the only way we have of giving meaning to things. With its help we have named our world and rendered it comprehensible. Beginning with ourselves, from our awareness of our own bodies, we have used metaphor to appropriate the things that surround us - from the leg of the table to the foot of the mountain - because we are incapable of imagining anything that does not exist. For every new invention is evolved out of what went before, and every new discovery is only brought to light by comparison with phenomena we already know. And the discipline that considers such matters its foremost concern is poetry. With which we conclude our first argument. Second argument: whereas oral poetry was a feat of memory during t hich rhapsodist, poem and listeners merged to a moment of pure presence, the impact on poetry of writing has been to elicit its timelessness. The consciousness of pure presence is probably confined in our own day to the moment of poetic inspiration, which continues - as our client is fond of repeating - until the man of Porlock knocks at the door. What ensues is the elaboration of the idea, the construction of the poem according to the pretensions of its form - which in fact amounts to a re-construction of that special moment. At the same time, the subject of this work is self-referential: memory itself. Our memory is no video-recorder, taping and rewinding films to requirement. On the contrary: whenever we remember, we reconstruct the past anew, rearranging fragments differently each time to create a novel entity. If oral poetry was comparable to a film, lyric poetry has more in common with 39</page><page sequence="9">IRISH PAGES a photograph; where the former saw its remit in presenting a broad canvas whose validity was universal, the latter can claim to lay before us snapshots of reality - however local and subjective they may be - whose definition and exposure is expertly handled. And whereas poetry in its epic capacity passed on the world of the past for the benefit of the future - oral poetry being a trade that was dependent on time - today's poetry is more likely to see its own activity as detached from time, its lines suggesting moments that are suspended outwith that dimension. The reasons for this lie in the musical constraints of metrical language, in rhyme, and in the strophic form. These three have one characteristic in common whose significance, though practically negligible with regard to oral poetry, has come to the fore as poetry has become more self-referential: the retrospect occasioned by their essentially repetitive structure. Rhyme is but an echo of a pre-determinant word-sound; the refrain takes us back to the beginning; the euphony of the lines implies the monotony of the eternally recurrent. It is this that enables a poem to restrain time, or indeed to bring it to a standstill, making it the only form to give lasting quality to a subjective factor that neither celluloid nor digital plastic can render. However, its ability to transcend what is merely private or purely individual is due to a second factor which, like music, has managed to survive the revolutionary impact of writing intact: the figurative language of poetry (literature since has added nothing to its panoply of rhetorical skills). It is thanks to the objectifying consistency of its diction that the highly subjective bearing of most modern poetry attains supra-individual significance. It does so by rendering the personal as the exemplary, representative and universal; and this in poems that are "total" works of art, comprising image and sound, language and music, the intellect and the emotions. The totality of a moment reduced to its most human dimension. Only a poem can do this - for it is something which prose narrative cannot comprehend, and which drama cannot act out. But what of truth? A good poem is distinguished from a bad poem by the extent to which it meets its own formal requirements - whether these be semantic and logical, allegorical and metaphorical, visual (like the Alexandrian calligrammes in which writing was shaped as Eros' wings) or mathematical (like the formal rules of combination used by magical charms, the hypograms, whose existence Saussure proved in Martial's poems, songs by Guihelm and Villon based on the medieval practice of gematry, or the constraints developed by the Oulipians). In the case of sonnets that imitate the logical closure of a syllogism, or of an allegorical poem intent on exploring every aspect of its 40</page><page sequence="10">IRISH PAGES semantic frame, the criterion of truth is relatively unproblematic. But what kind of truth inhabits poems such as those by Inger Christensen, in which the world is arranged in Fibonacci-sequences? Or - viewed simply - in stanzas structured by the consonance of terminal sounds? It may seem too absurdly logical to be true, but even the ancient Sumerians were drawn to the conclusion that similarly sounding words were related in kind at a fundamental level. Startlingly, their belief has been confirmed by research in neurology: a person conditioned in a language laboratory with electric shocks whenever he or she hears the word "rhyme" will also flinch on hearing that someone has had a good "time," or committed a "crime". It is apparent that rhyme has a basis in biology, a reality with a claim to its own criteria of truthfulness. But what of poems that incorporate textual graphics, what of object poems? Here too we need a poetics that is up-to-date - and which has yet to be written. One thing that can be said, however, is that visual figures of this kind are also ultimately preoccupied with the figurative imitation of structures which occur in Nature, thereby giving substance to the ancient Greek notion of mimesis: understood as the interpretation and portrayal of the real. There is probably no other art form which can execute these in more concentrated a form than the poem. That would normally suffice to conclude our plea, but there is more that needs to be said. We submit once again that poetry foregrounds the rules of its own genre: the different systematic arrangements of language. Since language and thought influence each other, both automatically include reality; poetry of whatever make is true if only because it is rooted in words. In this sense the poem - to hazard a modern frame of analogy - can be seen as a kind of module, the stanzas as circuit boards, and the lines as circuits. Taking this IT-jargon a step further we can see that while the carefully encoded language of poetry acts as a conductor between reality and consciousness, the poem in toto defines the various modalities by which reality can be mapped, as well as the experimental set-up that permits access to it in the first place. The decisive factor here is the conductivity of the poetic chip. If we now go on to question the truthfulness of poetry in this context, we are in fact addressing the problem in relative terms, for here it is more appropriate to speak of "good" or "bad" than "true" or "false". The more stringent the formal principle ordering the language, and the more rigorous its execution, the more efficient the poem will be as a vehicle for investigation and discovery - for only the poem's intrinsic precision can minimize the babble of data in the module. No matter what programme it is intent on carrying out, it will always be able to tell us something about reality, and be all the more truthful in doing so, the more comprehensive, efficient and 41</page><page sequence="11">IRISH PAGES integrated the performance of its inner circuits. What these relay to the screen are diagrams - diagrams like world maps: some recording rainfall, sea currents or wind direction; some recording geological patterns, altitudes or temperatures, others still demographic concentration or other statistics. Ladies and gentlemen, the thrust of my argument will be apparent: for each of the many maps generated by this programme a specific aspect of reality is revealed. Permit me to submit this as my third argument. This covers only one characteristic of poetry, however. The poem defined as a module with its ins and outputs of subjectivity and the world constitutes anything but run-of-the-mill IT. Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury, when my client - looking too blase by half after all these technical metaphors - views his verses in more pragmatic terms, as a speech act, then he is fully aware that they deviate from the truth quite deliberately, in as far as truth represents some kind of secret convention between human beings. This is because, a) he is usually more interested in originality than truth, which he often finds banal; b) because language as a medium lacks precision; and c) because of all the different styles of poetic diction. But also d) because of the complexity of its literariness, and e) because several principles of organisation are quite likely to concur within a single poem, and are therefore also equally likely to compete with one another: grammar with the elliptic line, both with the demands of metre and the patterns of sound, all these together with the logic of their various tropes and picture planes. It would be like a crossword puzzle attempting to incorporate several languages into its chequered pattern at once - and still make sense. Which is one of the reasons why there are so few good poems. To persevere in one's attempt to encounter the one truth that would be valid at every level, that, in the classical Greek sense, is the Eros of poetry: the desire to reach out and touch what cannot be grasped or held. More important than the gesture itself, however, are the ambiguities generated by the method it stands for. The way polysemy is produced at the intersection of the different linguistic planes. And contradiction. The way one part of a metaphor can thoroughly convince us and, at the same time, point to a second dimension that is unfathomable and cannot be thought through, a dimension that is metaphysical. This is the true achievement of poetry: in trying to portray the world as it is, it reveals the seeds of paradox wherever two words clash. Its truth is to show where and in what manner the dimension of contradiction begins. With the Wittgensteinian clarity appropriate to its hermeneutics, a poem supplies the criteria by which it must be judged as well as foundations 42</page><page sequence="12">IRISH PAGES upon which such criteria are based. So that we can retrace the way one word joins another in making something that transcends every dictionary and every language. The true freedom from contradiction which belongs to poetic truth can be summarized thus: a poem reaches out to the utmost bounds of philosophical knowledge by asserting, via its contradictions, that all poems, like all Cretans, lie - in as far as they are also telling the truth. Submitted as argument No. 4, this might seem excessively philosophical to any jury that were really hostile to our plea. But the ambiguities set up by poetry also have a thoroughly practical effect: they lay claim on behalf of the imagination to a space that cannot be confined or controlled, to areas where thought is free to roam and play. That is the reason why my client has felt gratified, indeed honoured, by accusations of subversion, demagogy and pornography. Because these have only served to expose the totalitarian systems whose show trials were intended to force him to his knees. Which they had good reason to do. Because under such dictatorships poetry - the oldest trade in the world - once more remembers its ancient Mediterranean traditions and reverts to what it once was: a universal organ of speech, albeit in this case underground, in samizdat form, as the secret cant of prisoners. It is for this reason too that my client is not especially perturbed to learn that my honourable colleague, the public prosecutor, has tacitly decided to drop all charges brought against him, for that is a sign that times for poetry must at least be good enough. For better or for worse, poetry is taken so much for granted now that nobody notices just how ubiquitous it has become. Indeed possibly too omnipresent - on every TV- screen after all, and every hoarding, every radio programme and every printed page. Which has set my client wondering ... Jochberg, s May 2003 INVENTORY I At the edge of the track between Amguid and Tamanghasset in the Algerian desert a plaque marks the Tropique du Cancer. To reach it you have to skirt the foothills of Garet el Djenoun, passing through a region where, in the fifties, the French tested hydrogen bombs in underground shafts. In Libya the 23.50 north latitude marks the beginning of the Aozou strip, which extends as far as the Tibesti Mountains, site of the ancient Garamantian emerald mines. Today the most striking thing about the place is its clutter of burnt-out machines left over from the war against Chad. Where the same latitude meets the intermittently 43</page><page sequence="13">IRISH PAGES mined Egyptian-Libyan border a rocky massif rears up on the plain, its precipitous face decorated with Stone Age engravings and rock paintings recalling a time when this was a place of rivers and lakes. Further east lies Aswan, the ancient city of Syene. It was here that Eratosthenes computed the Earth's circumference by measuring the angle of the sun's inclination in a well. But the further south you travel from this parallel towards the Tropic of Capricorn the more the sun in its career appears to tilt away behind your head, until eventually its position at noon is north. Between the tropics lie regions whose aridity is broken only in the equatorial zone, where a shallow layer of parasitic vegetation continues to cling to the eroding continental crust. Beneath its canopy are rotting tree trunks and the high-pitched whine of the insects. Impressions of the kind Darwin recorded in the Voyage of the Beagle of a sublime, majestic jungle, its hostility and impenetrability placing it on a par with the desert, show Nature wholly engrossed in itself, seemingly intent on exposing how naked the Earth is, and how vulnerable the life that inhabits it. Here is evidence of yet another meridian, linking the poles of the organic and inorganic, its extremes culminating in the equator and the tropics framing it. To refer to a landscape as hostile or inaccessible is to think of it in human terms. Nature, however, is nothing if not indifferent. To express that indifference in language one would need somehow to get outside the categories of human thought. But since they are all we have, we can think of it only as difference - a paradox we try to grasp through the concept of sublimity. It is a conundrum that lies precisely in our inability to put it into words. What we can say is that the various definitions of the sublime - which have characteristically overlapped in the course of the centuries with notions of terror, beauty, the picturesque and the Romantic - suggest a constant: affective experience in the face of nature, and the position we adopt as subjects relative to that experience. Ultimately, the sublime is nothing but the expression of an existential attitude, which, defeated persistently by the intangibility of nature, nonetheless takes its bearings with regard to that insuperable breach. That is as succinct a definition as the terms will allow. It is in these terms too that we may approach a poem that sets out to map the topography of the sublime on the grid of its tropes. In respect of height or depth, distance or proximity, the north sought by a dipping needle is always the foreign, the Other. But when a compass takes its orientation from the sublime its cardinal points change their names, displaced to a transcendental plane: the majestic and the unfathomable, the immeasurable 44</page><page sequence="14">IRISH PAGES and the oppressive. Extending the metaphor we could say that the sublime is based on a projection, one whose contour lines give shape to its relief. To find the right scale and align the sublime with the coordinates of a certain place and a certain time one looks for natural landmarks, aware that whatever one sees will inevitably depend on one's own point of view. Representations of the sublime in language thus are subject to distortion, but it is this, too, that alerts us to its strangeness, its resemblance to allegory in the original sense: sublimity as an Otherness permitting different readings. The void that is manifest here also gapes elsewhere: in the face of the mountains or the sea. It is a gap to which the gaze repeatedly returns, as if to a vanishing point. But this only demonstrates the extent to which all such meridians and parallels rest on illusion, on bearings no less deceptive than the notion that the sun rises in a certain place and circles the earth, or culminates at some time in the day at a point where it casts no shadow. They are nothing but human perspectives, constructed to relate the history of light and its spaces, an optics invented to bring us closer to things, and to the elementary truths that hold them together. The sea in Homer is purple, white, or the colour of wine, and the sky bronze or iron - but never blue. A Babylonian clay tablet describes Sirius with a coppery gleam, but for Ptolemy it was a yellowish colour, while Seneca saw it shining red, and Manilius blue - to us it appears white. Views of the sublime are similarly heterogeneous: as a product of the imagination, argued Kant, it is nothing but pure form, without substance. To describe the indescribable one must therefore fictionalise it - to the effect that the interfaces between subject and world, chaos and order, assume an emblematic reality of their own. In this sense the paradox of sublimity is reflected in the nature of light: we see because of it, we see through it, but we don't see it. Optike in Greek meant to "see clearly," but the true nature of light was no clearer then than it is today. The Pythagoreans thought the eye emitted a ray, the atomists Leucippus and Democritus that fine films, simulacra, continually emanated from the surfaces of things, while the Platonist Academy attempted a synthesis of both approaches. The Arab philosopher Ibn al-Haytham (known to the West as "Alhazen") came up with the idea that the eye was simply a receptacle for rays of light which it resolved to a point in the cornea - a theory considered of minor importance in his own day, but which later led indirectly to the invention of perspective and its visual pyramids. It was this theory too which removed the beholder to a position outside the picture; from now on he 45</page><page sequence="15">IRISH PAGES stood back and viewed the interior of the picture as through a window. This emphasis on the subjectivity of the observer would find a later echo in the Cartesian rift between mind and matter, a gap sublimity was subsequently required to re-fill. In describing light phenomena geometric optics from Euclid to Newton had assumed that rays of light travelled in a straight line. The experiments of Thomas Young challenged this assumption, however, launching the idea that light was dispersed in waves - until Einstein declared both ideas to be complementary. Under the influence of quantum theory the science was renamed "physical optics". It was through quantum physics too that the (microscopic) world became ultimately imponderable, existing solely in the eye of the beholder, presenting wholly different aspects of itself from one instant to another - for depending on the nature of an experiment light can be measured in terms of particles, waves, or energy. Moreover, every observation is itself deemed an intervention, changing the properties of the object. As Niels Bohr put it: "It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature." It is this act of speech that by virtue of reaching out into the world keeps one at one's desk: therein lies the first draft of every poem. Rational thought has its own ways of establishing the rudiments of things. Here and there it retraces the lines, occasionally suggesting its own line of investigation, annotating the margins of the verses, reviewing the genealogy of an idea. "To maintain 'the sublime' in the old sense" would be "wrong from the start"; it would be no less wrong to see it as a monolith, a block of poems, a single voice. Instead it resides in cadences and subtle inflections, in fragments and folds, in the unexpected proximity of different strata. These may interlock, but we cannot finally unlock them - poetic memory conforms to words only to give them a second, tropical meaning: the gaze into the zones of geography, rendered in figures of speech. INVENTORY II Thought yields in the figurative language of the tropes to concepts and phrases that depart from their literal sense. Figures of speech can reverse cause and effect, substitute a part for the whole, refer to one thing in terms of another, or compare different things. Sometimes they are given to circumlocution, to insinuating the opposite, or negation, of what is actually said. Used in this way 46</page><page sequence="16">IRISH PAGES words switch their focus from the things they usually mean to vanishing points far beyond their horizon. The rhetorical trajectory of the tropes, like the curve of the sun between the tropics, turns through figures of speech to seek an equator of language and nature. In the critical treatise by Pseudo-Longinus - Peri hypsous - the "exalted" exists because nature "has implanted in our minds an eternal desire (Eros) for anything which is great or, equally, for what we consider demonic." What this sentence invokes is a two-fold discrepancy. On the one hand sublimity is conceived of as a surrogate for a notion of divinity that goes beyond the purely canonical to comprehend whatever is overwhelming or all-powerful from every sphere of existence - including the "profound". On the other hand the sentence also addresses the rupture between mortal and immortal - all the examples cited in the text itself refer to different forms of the struggle with death: war, mortal danger, torture and agony. Sublimity implies an approach to something that transcends the quotidian in human affairs in order to experience life's finitude. The insight gained would be inspired by the voices of greater and lesser divinities - however overwhelmed by terror, mankind still enjoyed the protection of the gods, and it was from these gods too that humans received an inkling of their own greatness and bestiality. But such voices have grown quiet. What remains is the terrifying, eternal silence of empty space, described by Pascal in his Pensees: "For, finally, what is man in nature? He is nothing in comparison with the infinite, and everything in comparison with nothingness, a middle term between all and nothing. He is infinitely severed from comprehending the extremes; ... he is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness from which he arises and the infinity into which he is engulfed." Attempting nonetheless to find words for the sublime one ends up with concepts whose meaning, through the necessary addition of "un-,""in-,""im- " or "over-," is erased in the same breath. One can no more limit the scope of the sublime than reduce it to a single formula. Certainly, it announces its presence by way of style: sublimity is an aesthetic category because it is through aesthetics that we defamiliarize the world, and because only the unfamiliar is capable of expressing the sublime. In the Longinian text the tropical figures are therefore examined at some length. The unaccustomed light thrown on the world by the tropes reveals analogies whose paradoxical quality is capable of adumbrating aspects of nature that could not otherwise be grasped. The most radical figure of thought in this respect is the hyperbole: "Man is a speck of dust next to the size and duration of the universe" 47</page><page sequence="17">IRISH PAGES The Augustan period in which Pern hypsous was written had a different term for the elevated, one whose context has since slipped into the background: the august. This was derived from augere, which originally meant "to grow, or multiply," but also "to honour, or exalt". The two were linked in the archaic role of the poet as the master of ceremonies at fertility rites and performer of paeans, themes treated in the surviving work of Hesiod, in Theogony and Works and Days. The verb augere relates to "augur," the official whose duty it was to divine portents and find words for their sublime truths. With the help of his crooked divining staff the augur marked out the boundaries of his templum, a rectangular observatory where he would carry out hepatoscopy and the auspices, interpreting bird flight and branches of lightening. The augur's gaze is implicit in the first syllable of the word, aug: Indo-European *oc, which, via oculus (Latin, eye), becomes the German Auge. The history of the traditional Latin word for the sublime - sublimitas - adds further layers of meaning. Limes was the marked border or march of a piece of land, limus the fertile mire of the field, sublimare the act of raising demons from this underworld to the upper world. Sublimiter meant hovering to avoid enervation by earthly contact, while subliminis pointed to the lofty realms of the sky and the flight of birds. The latter connotation returns us to the eye, limis aspicere meaning to "glance sidelong at the sky". We have come full circle to the tropical gaze: a gaze through a verbal lens to the figurative focal point. The sublime exists solely in the picture we are capable of making of it. In terms of this picture sublimltas, like the Necker cube, is a kind of reversible image. The sublimity it denotes lies literally "under a threshold," suggesting an alternating perspective: a looming eminence that is nonetheless below something else, a gaze whose sense of scale is indwelling, but which nonetheless looks down from a point that is far beyond its apparent boundaries. Is this meant to be Janus, the god of thresholds? Does the image relate to the sill below or the lintel above the doorway? Is its sense linked to the notion of transitions, of border-crossings, or does it refer to the architraves of the temple, whose dimensions were gauged an appropriate size for the gods? The paradoxical nature of the sublime encompasses changing proportions no less than alternating viewpoints that only a metaphor can bring into alignment. The sublime stands as a substitute for the gods and Man - and for consciousness of the rift between them. Its subject is nature in the raw, as well as its various geographical determinants. Aristotle's model of the cosmic order 48</page><page sequence="18">IRISH PAGES dominated thinking until well into the Middle Ages. Above the earth began the celestial sphere within which the planets moved; this was surrounded by the hollow ball of the fixed stars, whose initial motion was caused by a divine demiurge and trickled downwards, ending with the circling moon: the inner limit of the universe. The drama of the sublunary sphere, its perennial discovery of sublimity in the mountains, was its longing to overcome that limit: to pile mountain on top of mountain, Ossa on top of Olympus, and Pelion on top of them, in an attempt to catch sight of heaven. The German word for beauty (das Schine) was derived from looking (German, schauen) and appearance (German, Schein). This engendered a corollary in the mid-eighteenth century when two works appeared almost simultaneously: Burke's Philosophical Enquiry, which popularised the sublime, and a theoretical work by Baumgarten introducing the concept of "aesthetics". The term in its original Greek had meant nothing more than perception in the optical sense. Baumgarten made it the subject of a science, which - untrammelled by logic - he applied to the "lower cognitive abilities" which culminated in poetry via the "sensory memory". Burke's treatise on the sublime covered similar ground: both thinkers invented schemes for emotional response and sensory impressions, thereby giving shape to ideas of the beautiful and sublime. The criteria for so doing had changed fundamentally since Pseudo- Longinus, however. The Renaissance had come and gone, and its experience of beauty now seemed rigidly symmetrical, its notion of the divine frozen by convention. The new ideal championed intimations of the chaotic forces concealed beneath the mask of form, the delicious thrill aroused by the sensation of fear, responses to silence and empty space. As if such stillness could be described with audible force, or as if it were the attempt to hear absolutely nothing - absolute nothingness. What had brought nature back to the centre of attention was the discovery in it of structures that could be read as signs. A modern definition of sublimity would be aware of the anthropomorphism implicit in our temptation to see in apparent laws of nature the expressions of an intellect. Even the waves of the ocean never seem purely arbitrary: their dynamism suggests a moving body. As if nature had a script whose alphabet we could partly decipher, without being able to reconstruct the entire language. The influence of speculative ideas generated by the natural sciences of the day was as contagious as it was conspicuous. Metaphysics transformed itself into empiricism. The idea of the sacred gave way to a deism that still saw the world 49</page><page sequence="19">IRISH PAGES in the hands of Providence but had long been sceptical of revelation. A new ethics saw the rage of the Homeric hero displaced by the pathos of the petit- bourgeois Klemnbiirger and his voyeuristic awe of majesty. In Newton's mechanistic universe, soon to find its correlative in the mechanisms of industrialisation, sublimity was synonymous with violent emotion that conveyed on the subject a sense of his own superiority, its symbols attending the construction of sentiment appropriate to the dawning age of technology. A rudimentary form of perceptual psychology, no less influenced by the science of the day, provided a theoretical framework for explaining such processes. According to Hartley complex ideas depended on the action of the senses, for "when external objects are impressed on the Sensory Nerves, they excite Vibrations in the Aether residing in the Pores of these Nerves." And Burke wrote: "Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger ... is a source of the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling." A precipitous mountain, for example, gigantic enough to send forth individual rays of light from a vast number of points at once, all of which make an impression on the retina, causes a painful tension of the eye (while a hill gives rise only to a gentle fluctuation of light impulses). The pleasurable sensation of the sublime derives from the knowledge that the apparent threat it poses is unreal, that it exists only in a virtual sense, so to speak - and that nervous tension will soon abate. "It is a natural inclination that leads us to admire not the little streams ... but the Nile, the Danube, the Rhine, and above all the Ocean," as the Longinian text claims. "Nor do we feel so much awe before the little flame we kindle ... as before ... the craters of Etna, whose eruptions bring up rocks and whole hills out of the depths." The sublime amounts to an aesthetics of first occasions: familiarity breeds contempt, which is why the sources of sublimity can never be momentous or impressive enough, before they too lose their edge. The reaction against the cult of the great heights and of magnitude, whose initial setting, Haller's Alps, shifted during the age of Darwin to the Amazonian and African tropics, before ceding to the polar icecaps, was a return to the archaic notions of profundity: the mire, the demons of the underworld, the inward gaze. On the entrails of the earth geology had now gained its hold, and chemistry had discovered the sublimate as a transitional aggregate between two different states. Applied to the "hepatoscopy" of the soul, however, the true figures of the sublime were those made manifest by - sublimation. This was a kind of twilight phenomenon that entered the language via the tropes of irony, litotes or periphrasis. "Bold, overhanging, and, as it were, threatening rocks, thunderclouds 50</page><page sequence="20">IRISH PAGES piled up the vault of heaven, borne along with flashes and peals, volcanoes in all their violence of destruction, hurricanes leaving desolation in their track, the boundless ocean rising with rebellious force, the high waterfall of some mighty river, and the like." According to Kant, these were the paramount symbols of the sublime. But the heights of Mont Blanc are unlikely to inspire much awe today, and even the ascent of Parnassus can be undertaken by cable- car. However, the sublime can still be revisited in connection with vast or empty spaces, or in the fundamentals of our modern conception of the universe. The incommensurable has become that which cannot be measured, while unsoundable depths have simply become unsound. In its attempt to explain them the scientific imagination runs up against the conceptual boundaries of nature, embodied in the sublime. The word itself is the substantivization ("that which is sublime") of a certain adjectival quality that cannot stand by itself. Its subject is not nature, nor is it the human being, but their relationship to each other - in as far as they are able to shape each other. In attempting to define the sublime as an event in nature one turns again and again to the (lost) notions of the divine, the transcendental and the metaphysical that informed the pattern of its early interpretation. Behind every storm towered the spectre of a god hurling thunderbolts; receding from the picture plane the orthogonal lines of the sublime could be confident of a vanishing point in an almost tangible beyond. It is a view of the phenomenon which has no place in the modern definition. Linear perspective has gone; the projected lines run on in parallel and converge only because the eye and calculus see it that way. The blank spaces beyond have been shaded in by the sciences, which have engineered the collision of light beams to produce matter, predicted an endlessly expanding universe, and computed the probability of elementary particles generating in a void. The tropes we employ to make sense of these things have not changed, but they have assumed a different sort of reality. In Benjamin's words, writing of the historical turning point of the First World War, what they now project is something like "the open air, amid a landscape in which nothing [is] the same except the clouds and, at its centre, in a force field of destructive torrents and explosions, the tiny, fragile human body."
