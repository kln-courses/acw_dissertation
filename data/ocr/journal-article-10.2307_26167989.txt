<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> When the Whale Responds: Narrating  the Ethical Subject in Farley Mowat’s A  Whale for the Killing Cheryl Lousley Department of English and Film Studies, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo,  Ontario, N2L 3C5, Canada; clousley@wlu.ca The essay discusses the significance of narrative for environmental eth- ics by attending to the conventions of autobiography in Farley Mowat’s  anti-whaling text, A Whale for the Killing. A tension emerges in envi- ronmental nonfiction narrative between the desire to transcend the self  and its expression in autobiographical form, which necessarily places  the self at the centre of the narrative. I trace the construction of the  narrator’s and whale’s ethical personae to argue that even as Mowat’s  narration of a subject-to-subject encounter challenges the ontological  and ethical divide between “human” and “animal,” it nevertheless re- constructs a liberal-humanist notion of subjectivity. So long as I live I shall hear the echoes of that haunting cry. And they will  remind me that life itself—not human life—is the ultimate miracle upon this  earth. I will hear those echoes even if the day should come when none of her  nation is left alive in the desecrated seas, and the voices of the great whales  have been silenced forever. —Farley Mowat, A Whale for the Killing When bees appear to “respond” to a “message,” they do not respond but re- act; they merely obey a fixed program, whereas the human subject responds  to the other, to the question posed by the other� This discourse is quite liter- ally Cartesian� Later, as we shall see, Lacan expressly contrasts reaction with  response in conformity with his opposition between human and animal king- dom, and in the same way that he opposes nature and convention.  —Jacques Derrida, “And Say the Animal Responded?” Celebrated Canadian author Farley Mowat has long advocated for environ- mental conservation and animal welfare. Mowat published A Whale for the  Killing in 1972, at the height of the international campaigns against whaling�  The popular nonfiction text is an account of Mowat’s efforts to save a female  Fin whale trapped one spring in a small Newfoundland bay, and mercilessly  Environmental Philosophy 5 (2), 129–147.

In Mowat’s text, the story of this one  whale serves as a call to action against the human activities that endanger all  whales, and the book concludes with a list of international organizations and  government departments readers can contact to advocate for whale protection.  In the passage above, Mowat presents his concern for the whales within a cri- tique of anthropocentrism, or the valuing of only human life. Along the lines of  Anthony Weston’s argument in “Before Environmental Ethics,” I want to out- line how even the “best” nonanthropocentric narratives “are still profoundly  shaped by and indebted to the anthropocentrism that they officially oppose”  (Weston 223). Whereas Weston points to the cultural milieu in which philoso- phy takes place as a limit on our imaginations, I will point to the significance  of narrative form as the already normative ground through which new environ- mental narratives are imagined and circulate.  In his essay “And Say the Animal Responded?” Derrida shows that lan- guage and discourse are the domains where anthropocentrism is re-enacted and  subverted by deconstructing Lacan’s distinction between reaction (automatic  or machinic action following a stimulus) and response (an unfixed reply that  constitutes the subjectivity of both the called upon and the questioner). In place  of the tidy Cartesian dualism that Lacan’s distinction maintains, Derrida opens  up the undecidability of completely and properly differentiating between reac- tion and response, and of associating either one with generic categories such  as “animal” or “human,” by noting how Lacan’s psychoanalytic approach to  subjectivity relies on subjection to genre and convention, or in other words,  programmed responses. Derrida therefore does not turn to “subjectivity” as the  means of incorporating “animals” into ethics, but rather argues for a more in- tensive appreciation of difference (among life-forms and within sign systems),  for it is unknowability and irreducibility that make one’s responsibility uncer- tain (and which thus open a space for response, not just reaction). Whereas  Derrida takes Lacan to task for presuming that “what calls itself human has  the right to rigorously attribute to man � � � what he refuses the animal” (137), I  question the ease (that I will show is also hesitant and uneasy) with which Mo- wat presumes to understand and credit the whale’s response� The comparison  is not as unlikely as it seems, as Mowat quite explicitly writes in what Der- rida describes as the archaic discourse underlying Lacan’s dualism: the “old  (Adamic and Promethean) theme of the animal’s profound innocence,” which  is juxtaposed with the failed or lacking human (132). Following and departing from ecocritic Lawrence Buell, I note that a ten- sion emerges in the environmental nonfiction narrative between the desire to  transcend the self and its expression in autobiographical form, the conven- tions of which necessarily place the self at the centre of the narrative. I focus  on the construction of the narrator’s and whale’s personae in A Whale for the  Killing’s depiction of an intimate encounter between man and whale� As I out- line in detail below, Mowat builds empathy for the whale through a series  of subject-to-subject encounters that emphasize communication through voice  </page> <page sequence="3"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 131 and, at the narrative climax, eye contact. I explore how Mowat’s narration of  the subject-to-subject encounter challenges the ontological and ethical divide  between “human” and “animal,” but also relies on a liberal-humanist notion  of subjectivity. I describe how A Whale for the Killing attributes Mowat’s ca- pacity to recognize the subjectivity of the whale to his ability to step beyond  parochial or selfish interests and respond merely as one living being to another.  The narrator constructs himself as a credible and privileged witness to whale  subjectivity by exposing his own initial misconceptions. The process Mowat  follows to strip himself of inherited narratives serves to set him apart from  other people, yet simultaneously enables him to become a “universal subject”  who symbolizes the potential of humans in general (generically) to reconnect  with the other animals�  Narrative, Ethics, and Subjectivity Narrative seems to appear in the discourse of environmental ethics in two  key guises. In one version, environmental ethics is narrative. Ecofeminists  such as Ariel Salleh and Val Plumwood, environmental justice critics such as  Giovanna Di Chiro, and postmodernists such as Anthony Weston and Peter  Quigley suggest the truth and authority claims of ethical reasoning follow the  textual conventions and social assumptions of particular classes of people lo- cated in a particular time and place. In other words, environmental ethics are  not universal claims located outside the sociopolitical realm, but narratives  inevitably contaminated by it. In the other version, narrative is contrasted with  environmental ethics, or at least positioned as a corrective or antidote to its  rationalist excesses. In his classic article “Postmodern Environmental Eth- ics,” deep ecologist Jim Cheney argues that narrative serves as a more ethical  way of knowing. Cheney describes narrative, as does Christopher Preston, as  contextual, self-reflexive, and embodied, a form of “situated knowledge” such  as described by Donna Haraway, whose own analytical writings commonly  adopt and foreground narrative techniques. In this second version, narrative  is contrasted with philosophical or analytical discourse and found to be richer,  thicker in description, and grounded in materiality. Narrative is posed as a  bridge or solution to the Enlightenment’s epistemological and ethical divide  between human subjects and nonhuman matter� The two guises are complementary: in both versions, narrative serves as  the metaphorical muck that either contaminates (when unacknowledged) or  grounds (when explicit) abstract discourse. An opposition between narrative  and philosophy thereby remains entrenched, much like the nature-culture du- alism that continually resurfaces in each new effort to transcend or subvert  anthropocentrism� More disconcertingly, the desire expressed by Cheney and  Preston to locate in narrative a route out of the epistemological issues that dog  philosophical debate reconstructs a long-standing genre-based gender divide.  Fiction and narrative are female to the male analytical when literature is po- sitioned as more authentic and embodied in comparison to the philosophical  </page> <page sequence="4"> 132 cHeryl lousley abstract� Most importantly, as Lorraine Code shows in her critique of Preston’s  Grounding Knowledge, self-conscious incorporation of narrative techniques  into philosophical writing, such as first-person narration, does not free the  analysis from questions about its situatedness� Code describes how what is  “missing from Preston’s account is any recognition of the able bodied, gender,  race, class and other specificities that contribute to the aptness of his examples,  especially the first person examples, for illustrating the grounding he aims to  achieve” (355). Code demonstrates how the ethicist’s recourse to narrative is  no way out of the sociopolitical muck, but provides a different rhetorical basis  on which to authorize his claims: the objectivity of the disembodied voice is  replaced with the authenticity of the subjective voice. Mowat draws on both forms of authorization in A Whale for the Killing:  chapter by chapter, the text alternates between a first-person narrated, plot- driven narrative in which Mowat recounts his efforts to save the whale, and  an expository account of whale biology and history presented in an objective,  declarative voice. These multiple narrative approaches remind us how differ- ent modes of narration function differently to build or undermine narrative  credibility and to elicit affective responses in the reader. Narrative can be un- derstood as a technology of knowing and telling, which is ordered by a series  of events, told by a narrator (whether implicitly or explicitly), and addressed  to an audience (see Rimmon-Kenan, Genette). What environmental ethics may  stand to gain most in a turn to narrative is not some purer epistemological  standpoint, but a body of criticism well-attuned to the nuanced ways in which  subjectivity is constructed and contested through language and narrative. Be- cause environmental debates about ethics and epistemology are wrapped up in  notions of the subject (who counts for moral consideration? who decides who  counts? what/who is the agent that perceives the world? where is knowledge  located? who speaks in deliberative settings?), then literary texts can function  as a stage for testing and exploring different approaches to subjectivity.  To take the subject as the focus of my ethical inquiry would seem to place  me in what Holmes Rolston describes as the “No people, no ethics” camp,  whereby “Nature comes to have value only when humans take it up into their ex- perience” (166; 167)� This epistemological claim has been so strongly equated  with anthropocentrism that ecocriticism as a field initially defined itself in op- position to contemporary trends in literary criticism that focus on constructions  of human subjectivity. In The Environmental Imagination, Buell, for example,  defines ecocriticism in opposition to what he calls a “fictionalist” model that  “tends to presuppose that the persona is the main subject” (96)� Buell proposes,  by contrast, that a “nonfictionalist reading presupposes that the persona’s most  distinctive trait is environmental proficiency” (96). Buell claims that due to its  reliance on referential language, nonfiction has the potential to be oriented to  the nonhuman, and thereby forgo anthropocentrism for ecocentrism� Despite  this argument, Buell’s analysis of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden (the text he  considers the most accomplished example of an ecocentric narrative) actually  </page> <page sequence="5"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 133 hinges on a reading of persona� The centrality of persona to Buell’s argument  is revealing because it confirms how inextricable subjectivity is from narrative,  and narrative from subjects (a narrative implies and constructs, even when un- dermining, a teller: a subject who knows, orders, and speaks). Buell suggests that environmental nonfiction narratives articulate an eco- centric ethical standpoint through two, often parallel, narrative processes:  “ecocentric literary vision may express itself both as a critique of the centrality  and even the legitimacy of human assertion and as an ascription of something  like human subjectiveness to the non-human world” (143). I follow Buell in  identifying and discussing the presence of these narrative strategies in envi- ronmental nonfiction, but I want to first emphasize how both centre on the  place of the subject in the narrative. First, Buell’s test of ecocentrism rests  on the achieved de-centring of the human ego, which he distinguishes from  mere absence of the human in the narrative or as narrator. Where the human  subject might be said to be completely “displaced” in the objective voice of  the scientific or analytical text, environmental nonfiction makes the attempt  at displacement explicit, and thereby recognizes and reflects on the ethical  task of relinquishing anthropocentrism. Buell argues that Thoreau’s “approach  to subjectivity makes apparent that the ‘I’ has no greater claims to being the  main subject than the chickens, the chopped corn, the mice, the snakes, and the  phoebes—who are somehow also interwoven with me” (Buell 179). Buell’s  argument that environmental nonfiction de-centres the human in favour of the  ecological is directed in part against the seemingly obvious claim that, as first- person narrative, the human self is foregrounded in environmental nonfiction  and functions as the primary and explicit frame through which the world is  encountered. Buell describes ecocentrism as a narrative strategy of displace- ment from the initial ordering provided by the narrative “I:” “Environmental  non-fiction . . . often directly represents this displacement by making human  figures hover at the edges of the text, sometimes hazing them as well as mar- ginalizing them by showing them as doltish observers or ineffective predators”  (Buell 168)� The comic displacement of the human narrator is a common tactic  throughout Farley Mowat’s oeuvre. Mowat makes space within his narratives  for “voiceless” subjects by constructing himself as an “incompetent bumbler”  (MacLulich 228). The decentring of the human self is an active process within  his narratives, much as Buell describes of Walden�  Second, Buell argues that the nonhuman is given value in environmental  nonfiction by being presented not merely as an object of another’s discourse,  but as having subject-like presence within the narrative. The narrative displace- ment of the human subject and the personification of the nonhuman (Buell’s  examples do not only focus on animals) are closely linked, as indicated by  Buell’s suggestion that Walden introduces an equivalence of importance or  value between the narrator and “the mice, the snakes, and the phoebes” (179).  The anthropocentric hierarchy is levelled by debasing and decentring the hu- </page> <page sequence="6"> 134 cHeryl lousley man subject, on the one hand, and by subjectivizing the nonhuman, on the  other hand. One problem with anthropomorphism and the personification of  nature in nonfiction is that, although the mechanical view of nonhuman ani- mals as lacking the capacity to feel may be discredited, it remains impossible  to know what animals or other nonhuman entities feel, think, or know because  of the limits of language and communication (a dilemma for conceptions of  human subjectivity and communication as well, as Derrida argues through- out his work). Buell finds that forms of anthropomorphism and personifica- tion nevertheless pervade environmental nonfiction, which he attributes to the  importance of subjectivity for conceptions of ethics. Mowat’s texts, again, can  serve as the exemplary case. In a discussion of Never Cry Wolf, Marta Dvorak  argues that its ethical narrative is created not only through a naïve and bum- bling narrator but more profoundly by shifting from autobiography to wolf  biography. In her article “Of Mice and Wolves and Farley Mowat,” Dvorak  describes Mowat’s approach as a process of simultaneously subjectifying the  nonhuman and deconstructing the narrating subject. Autobiography gives way  to wolf biography by reversing the roles of subject and object: “the lupine ob- ject of study becomes subject” (232) while “our scientist has become spectacle,  even clown, and the ‘specimens’ under study are the real subjects of the gaze”  (233). Much as Buell describes, the shift allows the narrative to move from an  anthropocentric to ecocentric perspective: it “displaces man from the centre of  stage and replaces him with another of God’s creatures” (Dvorak 235).  Buell’s account of the shifting persona of the environmental nonfiction  narrator is useful, but nevertheless limited. Buell discounts the political ten- sion raised by the mediating role of the human subject when he affirms the  truth-value of mimetic representation (see Phillips for an extended critique).  In defining the ecocentric narrative as the relinquishment of human ego, Buell  does not discuss the grounds on which the narrating self of environmental non- fiction bases its claims of truth and ethics. Nor does he question the authority  on which the narrator speaks. Feminist ecocritic Gretchen Legler, in her article  “Body Politics in American Nature Writing,” argues that Buell’s notion that  the human subject disappears or is decentred in environmental nonfiction fails  to acknowledge that such a position is only available to the socially privileged  white male who can take his selfhood for granted. The experience is presented  as if universally accessible to any human because the privileges that enable it  are erased. A particular version of nature that coincides with white, middle- class values results, though rendered as if “nature itself.” Legler connects these  political omissions to the ethical stance of the persona, citing Peter Fritzell’s  description of the sense of “moral purity” constructed in nature writing:  [I]nstead of paying attention to the political specificity of their being in the  natural world, the vast majority of American nature writers “have tended  to generalize (and even abstract) the ‘personal’ and the ‘subjective’ in their  engagements with non-human nature, to render themselves and their envi- </page> <page sequence="7"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 135 ronments soundly customary, scientifically and aesthetically clean, and most  often morally pure�” (Legler 72) In sum, the radical relinquishment of individual autonomy that Buell extols in  environmental nonfiction simultaneously denies and relies on the narrator’s  social privileges to present an ethically pure human subject. Lewis Ulman argues that the subjectivity of the narrator is central to the  ethical orientation of environmental nonfiction precisely because of its nonhu- man focus. Ulman suggests the ethical sensibility developed in nature writing  (a subset of environmental nonfiction) depends on the self-representation of the  narrator as an ethical agent� In its combination of autobiography and natural  history observation, “nature writing entails a hybrid mode of interpretation— making available to other persons a symbolic model of cognitive, affective,  physical, ethical, and pragmatic relationships to the non-human world charac- teristic of an individual or collective human subject” (49, italics in original)� In  other words, the construction of the persona of the nature writer underlies the  persuasiveness of a text’s ethical stance. Sylvia Bowerbank presents a similar  argument in “Nature Writing as Self-Technology.” Bowerbank suggests that  nature writing presents a narrative that depicts a conversion in subjectivity (see  also Slovic):  Nature writing is a distinctive form of testimony in which the subject bears  witness to mutuality between the subject and self-willing nature� An intense  moment of ecstatic mutuality with wild otherness is structured as an epipha- ny, as a rhetorical and spiritual high point in the text� (173)  Bowerbank reframes Buell’s narratives of ego relinquishment and nature per- sonification into a single process that constitutes both the human subject and  the nonhuman as partners capable of ethical encounter� Drawing on Foucault’s  analysis of modern technologies of the self, Bowerbank suggests that “the sub- ject undertaking self-transformation in the name of nature is the same self- improving, driven and resourceful modern subject we know so well” (166).  The persona of the nature writer becomes worthy of the encounter with the  nonhuman through a process of being “disciplined by its own self-constituting  practices” (166)� Indeed nature writing can be seen as a form of “self-technol- ogy” that “deliberately cultivates a certain structure of feeling, a reciprocity  between the narrating subject and wild nature” (173)� Although this reciprocity  relies on the rhetoric of a self unencumbered by social and material constraints,  for Bowerbank, like Buell, this is an achievement of the narrator and the nar- rative; a “green subjectivity” is constructed through an active process of re- linquishment, which begins with and is enabled by distinctly modern material  networks and power formations (164). A Whale for the Killing is a useful text through which to approach the nar- rative construction of ethical subjectivity because the socio-historical context  is not elided but instead provides the dramatic tension against which Mowat  and the whale emerge as ethical actors. Indeed, the book, and subsequent film,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 136 cHeryl lousley was highly controversial for its depiction of Newfoundlanders as bloodthirsty  hooligans (see Overton; O’Flaherty). A series of conflicting representations of  Newfoundland outport people serves as the prelude to Mowat’s encounter with  the Fin whale. Through this backdrop, Mowat presents a narrative of his own  critical awakening: a once naïve Mowat learns to transcend inherited cultural  assumptions. This is the “self-work” involved in preparing the narrator for the  encounter with the animal, and which underlies the rhetorical appeal of the  text� Personal Encounters As noted above, A Whale for the Killing alternates between a first-person nar- rative and an expository account of whale biology and history. These alternat- ing points of view build toward the climax of a cross-species, personal encoun- ter between Mowat and the trapped whale� In the expository chapters, Mowat  adopts the objective voice of science to correct common misconceptions about  whales: “Most assuredly whales are not fish, although until a century ago most  people, including those who knew them best, their hunters, thought they were”  (44). But science is insufficient for Mowat to invoke empathy. With the satire  and hyperbole that Dvorak suggests defines Mowat’s style in Never Cry Wolf,  he builds up the lofty, altruistic aims of science in order to expose how bureau- cratic inertia and specialist arrogance undermine its potential� One institution  will not call its whale specialist back from a museum to see the living thing;  another claims that Fin whales do not eat herring, a fact easily contradicted by  the local fishermen. A third scientist sends Mowat a telegram instructing him  to record “how many excretions observed [in] twenty-four hours” (174). Mo- wat supplements science with anthropomorphism to make the vastly different  world of these eighty-ton water creatures understandable� Mowat presents Fin  whales as exemplary monogamous lovers with nuclear families and suggests  the males fulfill the “unto death do us part” wedding vow in a way that humans  rarely do: “Whalers have long been aware of this, and have bloodily profited  from the knowledge. They knew that if they could harpoon the female in a pod,  her mate would remain by her” (151). The species’ monogamous behaviour is  personalized when the trapped whale and her mate, who lingers outside the  pond until her death, are observed blowing in sync, even though out of sight  from one another. It is in the naïve voice of a local fisherman that Mowat  spells out the implications: “Maybe ‘tis foolish, but I believes they’s a pair and  they talks somehow. You say the one inside’s a she? Well, bye, I says the one  outside’s a he” (154, italics in original). With these allusions to conventional  middle-class heterosexual norms, Mowat lays the groundwork for the appear- ance of the whales as subjects�  Mowat foreshadows the moment of contact with brief encounters that em- phasize the whales’ rarity, mystery, and majesty. On the final leg of Mowat and  his wife Clare’s journey to the outport Burgeo, being ferried to their house by  a neighbour, they receive “a fine homecoming gift” in the “blurred, elusive  </page> <page sequence="9"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 137 glimpse” of a whale, addressed with religious awe as “one of the Great Ones  of the oceans” (30)� The whale sightings are not presented chronologically  but according to increasing proximity and view. A better view comes from the  window of an airplane where Mowat is able to observe how the whales use  their tails and flukes to propel themselves through the water. But even as his  knowledge grows, the experience only confirms the whales’ mystery when the  pod descends, “shimmering and diminishing in our view as if they were sliding  down a long, unseen chute leading to the privacy of the abyssal depths” (85).  The mystery heightens the preciousness of the whales, but empathy for their  fate requires that distance to be breached. Therefore, even as Mowat empha- sizes the unfamiliarity of the whales and the little that is known about them, he  simultaneously makes their behaviour and culture familiar through scientific  description and anthropomorphism. Mowat suggests that little is known about  whales because they have always been approached as prey and enemy. He  characterizes whaling as a form of colonial conquest, which will be re-enacted  in the violence of the sport hunters: “The meeting was not a peaceful one, in  mutual recognition of each other’s worth� As usual, it was man who set the  terms—and he chose battle” (47). Whaling, and even science, is based on a  subject-object relationship with whales; Mowat argues for the recognition of  the whales as subjects in their own right�  Descartes made self-consciousness the marker of subjectivity, a criteria  which, as the debates within animal ethics have shown, is epistemologically  challenging to establish with regard to other animals. But ever since Freud, self- consciousness is no longer taken as even the basis for human subjectivity. La- can’s psychoanalytic account suggests subjectivity is, in part, an illusory sense  of wholeness and autonomy constructed when seeing the image of “oneself”  reflected in a mirror or the eyes of others, combined with our subjection to the  symbolic order through language and speech� Indeed, moral consideration of  animals is often associated with recognition of subjectivity through voice and  eyes. Neil Evernden argues that humans readily recognize the expression of  pain in other people and animals through screams and cries (14–18)� He further  suggests that the stare or gaze poses a question of whether one is prey, a thing,  to a predator or “a centre of existence, a willful presence which asserts its  subjectivity” (92). John Berger similarly argues that animals have historically  played a significant role in human cultures and notions of selfhood because  they look back at us (cf. Derrida, “The Animal That Therefore I Am”). More  intimate and significant, then, than Mowat’s brief sightings of whales is his  experience of hearing the Fin whale voice on four occasions, each time only  accompanied by a local fisherman who is as awestruck as Mowat at the “other- worldly sound” (91). After hearing the voice, they wait in attentive silence for  a second round, which usually does not come� It is on the third occasion, after  the trapped whale has been tormented with bullets and speedboats, that they  achieve a poignant yet ecstatic connection that transcends the species barrier.  Awed observation gives way to a dialogical encounter between individuals as  </page> <page sequence="10"> 138 cHeryl lousley the whale makes eye contact with Mowat and his companion. In the epiphanic  moment when “she swung her head slightly so that one cyclopean orb looked  directly at us” (194), the whale is no longer a mere object, however admired,  of the human gaze, but an active, autonomous, sentient being. The encounter  reverses the conventional subject-object relationship of science and whaling.  The whale looks at the people, who sit still and merely receive her look. When  it is followed by another cry, they interpret the event in rapturous tones as a  response to their presence, and as a plea asking of them a response. It is in the naïve voice of the fisherman Onie that Mowat first makes the  dialogical encounter attributable to the intentions of the whale: “That whale... she spoke to we! I t’inks she spoke to we!” (195, ellipsis and italics in origi- nal). With the support of this eyewitness, Mowat can adopt the objective voice  to declare that which is scientifically non-verifiable: “I nodded in agreement,  for I will always believe she deliberately tried to span the chasm between our  species—between our distant worlds. She failed, yet it was not total failure.  So long as I live I shall hear the echoes of that haunting cry” (195). In this  climactic scene, the hubris of the human subject is humbled in recognition of  the larger community of subjects of which he is just one part� This ecologi- cal epiphany resembles the plot of “ego relinquishment” that Buell traces in  Walden and Bowerbank suggests defines nature writing. The first-person narra- tor strives to make space for the Other within the human frame of narrative by  emphasizing the agency of the nonhuman: the whale turns to look at Mowat;  the narrator becomes recipient of the look. He sits back and lets the Other speak  and act. Moreover, as the language of “worlds” implies, the moment of intense,  personal connection between individuals comes to stand for a planetary meet- ing between two species. The trapped Fin whale becomes a representative of  an endangered species, making a plea for the survival of her entire kind. Their  moment of connection is a “miracle” (195) because an engagement between  subjects across barriers greater than language and culture� There is, however, another “other” in the scene: the local fisherman, Onie.  Mowat’s reliance on naïve voices for his boldest claims about whale subjectiv- ity shows him reticent to step outside the authorizing discourse of science and  material observation, even as he exposes the limits of scientific knowledge and  representation. Nevertheless, the truth of this “miracle” of ecological oneness  must rest on the personal testimony of the narrator� The plausibility of Mowat’s  ecological epiphany relies on the narrator’s self-representation as a credible  narrator and an ethical actor, precisely because empirical knowledge and a ma- terialist “object”-world account of nature proves inadequate to describe his ex- periences or to show ethical recognition of the whale� Buell proposes that this  unavoidable paradox is mitigated by the efforts of the narrator to destabilize  the position of the perceiving self. But Mowat’s account of the gaze-reversal  implies that the narrator is a neutral reporter, relaying back to humanity the  ecstatic wonders of the Other�  </page> <page sequence="11"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 139 Narrating Credibility Mowat constructs himself as credible narrator and ethical agent through his  representation of rural Newfoundland. He shows himself to be an individual  particularly astute and sensitive toward the nonhuman, in part, by the unique  access he has to rural people and the sympathy he has for their lives and, si- multaneously, by the contrast he draws between himself and his parochial rural  neighbours. The counterpart to the narrative of ecological epiphany in A Whale  for the Killing is a narrative of rural disillusionment. Mowat constructs and  then dismantles an idealized view of rural life lived in tune with nature, which  functions as a narrative of his hard-won effort to transcend inherited cultural  assumptions. Mowat’s exposure of the fallacy of the rural idyll serves to es- tablish his credibility as a narrator, showing both his deep knowledge of the  rural and his maturity of understanding� But the process of self-examination  that the narrator undertakes as he questions his naïve beliefs also performs  a form of ethical self-reflexivity for the reader that suggests his personal en- counter with the whale is accessible to all who undertakes a similar process  of opening themselves up to truth and otherness. It is a liberal stance at odds  with the hatred and distrust of otherness that Mowat presents as the local com- munity’s response to the whale and himself� The narrator therefore emerges as  a “universal subject” not because the social context is excised from the scene,  as Legler would have it, but through his differentiation from the marked rural  subject� The epiphanic eye-to-eye encounter between Mowat and the whale  confirms not only the subjectivity of the whale, but also the ethical subjectivity  of the narrator� Mowat includes a cast of characters in A Whale for the Killing who speak  in a fractured dialect that marks them as local—as a people whose culture is  shaped by the isolation and environment of a place, not the generic require- ments of formal education� By prefacing or following many of his expository  sections with the voices of locals, Mowat evades the accusation that he is yet  another ivory-tower scientist or armchair romantic out of touch with reality.  For example, Mowat describes the policy of centralization that moved people  from outports to larger communities with moral outrage for the “forcibly up- rooted inhabitants” who are “victims of the cult of Progress” (12). A dragger  owner on the coastal boat, by contrast, is shown to put it in terms of local pride  and resistance: “Hah! By the Lard Jasus, they fellers in St. John’s is goin’ to  find they needs a full cargo o’ dynamite to shift Grey River. Aye, and I don’t  say as even that’ll shift they people” (14). The local perspective, given the ring  of authenticity with its representation as heavily accented speech, confirms  and backs up Mowat’s opinions. With the authority of “real life” behind him,  Mowat then elaborates on the historical and political story behind the central- ization policy� This pattern of dual reference is repeated throughout A Whale  for the Killing: Mowat’s observations are repeated in the colourful, concrete  language of the locals, then given more authoritative explanation by reference  to science or history� </page> <page sequence="12"> 140 cHeryl lousley Mowat takes the idealization of the rural and demonization of modernity  to rhetorical excess in order to build dramatic tension around the moral gap be- tween the ideal and the real� Mowat uses the image Leo Marx describes as the  “machine in the garden” to convey the magnitude and disruption of the loom- ing changes modernity threatens. Describing the modern fish plant established  at Burgeo, Mowat writes, “The roar of its diesel generators deafened us, and  the stench of the place was an abomination under God” (20). The overblown  rhetoric against the invasion by the machine is more subtly reinforced by Mo- wat’s characteristic tall-tale humour. “In 1962, the first two cars were unloaded  from the coastal boat,” Mowat relates with deadpan seriousness, “They met a  happy fate a few days later when they collided head-on and both were reduced  to junk” (31). The fish plant will not disappear so easily (nor, of course, do  the cars). The fish plant is a symbol of how the outport itself will change as  the line between rural and urban collapses under modernization and industri- alization. In an extended metaphor of disease, Mowat makes the fish plant the  incubator of a fever that “infect[s] the dispossessed outport people” with “the  universal sickness of modern society,” namely consumerism (30). The outport  people are repeatedly positioned as “victims” in this dichotomous geography  (12; 29), and change is presented as an intrusion from outside� The climax of  the plot comes when Mowat discovers the outport people are also perpetrators  of violence. Burgeo’s goodness is most fervently established by the acceptance and  appreciation its people seem to exhibit toward wild animals, especially the  whales:  The tranquil acceptance of the Fin Whales at Burgeo was in sharp contrast  to an incident I witnessed at about this time at St� Pierre � � � Most of the in- habitants there are fisherman too, but St. Pierre itself is full of shops, tourist  establishments, ship repair facilities, and people whose loyalties lie with the  modern industrial society� (63) The St. Pierre incident, which foreshadows the violence that Mowat witness- es in Burgeo, involves a group of 23 Pothead whales and calves that, having  sought refuge in a harbour, are harassed and killed by a group of men and boys  in motorboats. For Mowat, the men’s use of modern technologies to undertake  the slaughter both explains and epitomizes the moral vacuity of modernity. The  detachment from nature has freed these men from any respect for the whales  or fair game. The rifles and boats mean the whales are vastly out-armed, even  though they are powerful creatures adept at defending themselves. The inci- dent therefore serves both to illustrate the depths of depravity that modernity  can induce and to establish the whales as innocent creatures battling for their  lives under unfair rules of engagement. Since, for Mowat, Burgeo’s image as  rural idyll rests on its harmonious relationship with these innocent creatures,  the attack on the trapped, female Fin whale therefore represents the ultimate  betrayal of that chivalric ideal. </page> <page sequence="13"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 141 To heighten the irony of his misplaced idealism, Mowat recounts the sor- did events before placing himself and his wife in the scene. They blissfully  maintain their pastoral ignorance until it is too late. On the day the whale is first  attacked, the Mowats are on a hike observing bald eagles, which Mowat de- scribes as “yet another vanishing species” only seen in remote, non-industrial- ized areas such as Burgeo (108). As the Mowats are affirming their belief in the  wholesome nature of Burgeo, a shooting orgy is underway in Aldridges Pond�  Twenty-five gunners relentlessly fire on the whale, which became trapped after  entering the bay during a storm in high tide and eventually dies from infection  of her gunshot wounds. An “atmosphere of fiesta” is created among the towns- people who arrive to “watch the show” (110). The scene contradicts everything  Mowat has believed about the outport people: it shows contempt for nature  rather than awe, wastefulness rather than prudence, and hate toward otherness  rather than tolerance�  At first, to keep his image of the outport pure, Mowat associates all the  shooters with the outside and/or the fish plant, whether workers, managers,  owners, or business partners. The plant workers who start the shooting spree  are introduced as outsiders: “Although these men had all been born on the  Sou’west Coast, they had all spent some years away, either in Canada or the  United States” (105). Mowat reserves particular scorn for “the smart young  fellow who spent their springs, summers and autumns working the Great Lakes  freighters, and their winters at home in Burgeo drawing unemployment insur- ance” (108–9)� Their corruption by the outside and disconnection from na- ture is underscored by comparison with the progress-smitten fools who order  the first cars: they travel in “a big outboard speedboat, purchased through the  catalogue” (140)� The point is reinforced with subsequent references to the  “mail-order speedboat”—a sneering juxtaposition of dependence and power  that undercuts the masculine bravado with which the shooters terrorize the  whale and taunt Mowat (141)� The cruelty and ignorance of these “outsiders”  is contrasted with the kindness and appreciation for nature shown by the fish- ermen who befriend the Mowats and ferry them around the outport� These are  the men that alert Mowat to the situation at Aldridges Pond and help him try to  save the whale by fencing off the pond and bringing her fish.  But Mowat’s careful separation between the good, traditional Burgeo and  the contaminating, modern outsiders proves untenable. The moral equation of  nature and rural is ruptured when Mowat calls for the whale’s protection and  the majority side against him: some shifting their stance according to the fickle  winds of political and economic self-interest; others choosing loyalty to the  community over acceptance of the outsider, whether whale or human. Mowat’s  rural idyll thereby collapses in the face of historical circumstance� Adopting  the voice of hindsight, Mowat relates how he was so deceived by his desire for  </page> <page sequence="14"> 142 cHeryl lousley an idyllic refuge that he had not seen the place as it really is, a microcosm of  any human society, with both good and evil and a complex range of motiva- tions:  My journal notes, written late that night, reflect my bewilderment and my  sense of loss. “. . . they are essentially good people. I know that, but what  sickens me is their simple failure to resist the impulse of savagery...they  seem to be just as capable of being utterly loathsome as the bastards from the  cities with their high-powered rifles.” (146–7, ellipses in original)  Mowat belatedly recognizes the “savagery” underlying the rural life he roman- ticized as a middle-class outsider� Mowat’s disillusionment about outport life  functions to shift his pastoral ideal from a rural-urban axis to a nature-human- ity axis. Mowat sides with the whales, affirming their grandeur against flawed  “humanity,” now constructed as a universal identity that includes the savagery  of both the primitive and the modern individual. The initial construction of the  rural in idyllic terms serves to show Mowat as a naïve urbanite who learns by  experience that the rural does not necessarily lead to the natural or the moral�  A Universal Subject As Mowat dispels the myth that rural people are closer to nature, he him- self replaces the fishermen of rural Newfoundland as the representative of a  non-alienated relationship with nature, as demonstrated by his eye-to-eye,  subject-to-subject encounter with the whale� He does so by reference to the  Kantian terms of humanist enlightenment. He proves himself an ethical agent  by placing himself at a critical distance from exclusive or authoritative nar- ratives of nature, such as those provided by science, pastoral romanticism, or  rural authenticity. The narrative of A Whale for a Killing epiphany, based on  the successive debunking of misconceived prejudices, suggests Mowat’s ethi- cal authority is based on nothing but critical thinking and open-mindedness.  His self-criticism and experiential learning is presented as a method of ethical  engagement available to anyone willing to examine one’s own biases. Mowat  uses the blind spots of the pastoral to justify an appeal to the compassionate,  tolerant individual free from the prejudices of culture. The insular nature of the local confers legitimacy on Mowat’s rural nar- rative through the guise of authenticity: local people have ecological knowl- edge gained through hard work and experience. But whereas Wordsworth’s  Michael remains a silent archetype, Mowat is acutely aware that rural people  don’t always behave appropriately, and even talk back. The dictates of geog- raphy do not make them model ecological subjects. Searching for a more solid  epistemological ground on which to base advocacy for nature, Mowat turns  inwards, stripping away the cultural narratives that have distorted his percep- tion. Similarly, the violence and exploitation to which the animal is subjected  is attributed to the narrowness of the human imagination when confronted by  difference: the anthropocentrism of modern society is enacted through the  </page> <page sequence="15"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 143 intolerance of individuals. The authentic rural becomes the parochial rural,  which represents the narrow-minded instrumentalism of human institutions  and practices generally� It is in the autonomous subject’s ability to transcend  the particular demands of self-interest and the boundaries of place, relying  merely on his innate compassion and reason, that an ethical relationship with  the Other is made possible�  Indeed, from the outset, Mowat puts the predicament of the whale in glob- al, not local, terms. Before he even sees the trapped Fin whale, Mowat declares  that “If that whale lives, Burgeo’ll be famous all over the world” (124). Mowat  turns to extra-local institutions to help save the whale, just as he turns to the  findings of science to elaborate on the experiential knowledge of the locals.  The parochial vision of the scientists, more comfortable with data and dead  skeletons than living animals, is the mirror image of the parochialism of the  locals; Mowat alone proves himself to have global interests at heart. Just as  the epiphanic moment of encounter requires Mowat to step beyond his own  interests and biases, the recognition of the whale’s importance requires aware- ness of how one’s own place and knowledge is part of a larger world. It is this  cosmopolitan outlook that differentiates Mowat’s approach to ethics from the  approach of his neighbours, not the recognition of the whale’s subjectivity per  se. Mowat shows he is not the only person on the local scene to find fault with  the men who shoot at the whale, nor the only one to feel awe at the sight of the  whale, nor the only one to hope she regains her freedom� But he alone sees the  situation in global or universal terms.  The trapped Fin whale is not just a single whale for Mowat, but a represen- tative of an endangered species, and a symbol for the many other species and  habitats that are endangered and degraded� Burgeo, in turn, carries the symbol- ic weight of the relationship between human culture and the natural world� Mo- wat’s loyalties rest not with the particular community but with the integrity of  that larger, ecological world� By going public, Mowat exposes moral failings  within a community where “criticism was seldom openly expressed” (111)�  One of the fishermen displeased with the shooting makes this clear to Mowat:  “Rotten bastards they is, but I’ll not tell their names” (112). It is the violation of  this communal value system that sets Mowat apart from his neighbours:  I had shamed them, as a group, as a community, as a people � � � and had done  so publicly. The stranger in their midst had spoken his heart and displayed his  rage and scorn. We could no longer pretend we understood each other. We  had become strangers, one to the other� (146, italics and ellipsis in original) Although the narrative concludes with Mowat making peace with some of his  neighbours, the publication of the book and the release of a film adaptation  repeat this public shaming, as the vitriolic responses from literary critics and  the general Newfoundland public shows (see Overton for a discussion). It is a  betrayal that is made possible by Mowat’s privileged outsider status and which  </page> <page sequence="16"> 144 cHeryl lousley Mowat implicitly justifies on account of the greater good that will come from  broad public awareness of the plight of whales� The validity of Mowat’s cosmopolitan stance is seemingly confirmed  within the text by the overwhelming response his campaign to save the whale  receives from “average people” from across North America once he gets the  word out to the Canadian media (through his contacts as a national author)�  Just before the whale’s health makes a turn for the worse—the moment when  there is still hope—Mowat describes the letters that arrive from “schoolchil- dren, the manager of a Chicago automotive works, a stockman from Calgary, a  radio disk jockey from New York and a housewife from Labrador City” (182).  The range of places, professions, ages, and genders gives the impression that  people from any walk of life can step past their immediate confines (such as  nation or class) and care for another, just as Mowat has� His actions are con- firmed as reasonable, admirable, and ethical—the “right thing to do”—when it  appears that the average person would do the same. Moreover, as readers, we,  too, are affirmed because our sympathies for Mowat and the whale confirm us  to be tolerant, caring individuals. The story of Mowat and the whale emerges  as a universal narrative that anyone/everyone could relate to because it is pre- mised on the common-sense morality of liberal pluralism� The text therefore  relies on the same liberal-humanist conception of ethics and subjectivity that  ecocentrism seemingly calls into question� Mowat assumes a post-hoc posi- tion beyond the particularities of place: the narrator stands above the heated  fray in which he was a central political actor to make a universalized appeal  to compassion and reason� It is no contradiction that the implied audience for  A Whale for the Killing is both the presumed average North American and  the urban centre of media, science, politics, and educated public opinion that  can change global whaling policy. In Mowat’s text, the rural is marked as the  particular: the quaint margins from which the follies of modernity can be il- lustrated and the constrained circumstances that must be transcended in order  for an individual to become a full-fledged ethical subject. Conclusions Mowat’s personal narrative of a subject-to-subject encounter with the whale  undermines the anthropocentric divide between “human” and “animal.” The  first-person narrator makes space for the Other within the human frame of nar- rative by reversing the roles of narrating (human) subject and observed (ani- mal) object: the whale turns to look at and speak to Mowat. Although but mo- mentary, these reversals of subject position expose the limitations of humanist  language and narrative, and challenge the equation of subjectivity—and there- fore ethical recognition and political voice—with the human. But Mowat’s  narrative nevertheless relies on a liberal-humanist notion of subjectivity. The  whale gains ethical recognition the more she is described as similar to hu- mans: the bodily similarity of face is highlighted, while differences in size are  </page> <page sequence="17"> WHen tHe WHale resPonds 145 minimized; interpersonal communication is highlighted, while differences in  frequency, acoustic range, scale, and signifying system are minimized. Taking  the human to be the standard is a useful rhetorical device in an anthropocentric  culture, as Buell notes. But Mowat’s narrative strategy additionally constructs  subjectivity as a universal trait free from culture and history. Both Mowat and  the whale are stripped of history and culture at the moment of their encounter�  Burgeo represents the narrow, self-interested human world that Mowat—him- self unmarked by geography or class—rises above to reach out to the whale  (and to the reader, who is also implicitly positioned as more open, worldly, and  tolerant than the inhabitants of Burgeo)� The trapped Fin whale becomes a rep- resentative of her biological order, making a plea for the survival of the whales  and endangered species everywhere. Even though her suffering and death are  not directly related to the whaling industry that threatens whale populations,  her isolation as an individual allows her to be a personalized representative or  voice for whales, and for the natural world as a whole. The moment of intense,  personal connection between individuals comes to stand for a planetary meet- ing between humans and nature�  In Mowat’s replacement of the pastoral’s urban/rural dichotomy with  a human/nonhuman dichotomy, the animal takes the place of the ultimately  misunderstood other. Unlike the fractious dialogues Mowat has with his rural  neighbours, his fleeting encounters with the whales remain pure because so  terribly incomplete� At the height of the narrator’s epiphany, the whale, assum- ing almost human subjectivity, appears to speak—but this nonhuman voice  remains incomprehensible, at least without translation from the narrator� A  Whale for the Killing draws on history to reject rural essentialism, but recre- ates an essentialist configuration of the animal, which assumes the revered yet  silent position once held by the rural ecological subject� To return to Derrida,  Mowat recognizes the whale as subject by reducing her to the same: his inter- pretation of her cry within the conventions of an ecocentric narrative functions  to disavow her particularity and difference, and thus the possibility of her re- sponse, thereby foreclosing ethical responsibility at the moment he seems to  present it�  References Berger, John. 1980. “Why Look at Animals?” In About Looking, 1–26.
