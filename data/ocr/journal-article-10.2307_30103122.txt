<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEVANTINE ELEMENTS IN THE SACRED ARCHITECTURE OF THE AEGEAN AT THE CLOSE OF THE BRONZE AGE THE spatial planning of Mycenaean citadels is better understood now, due to recent discoveries of cult structures in the Unterburg of Tiryns and the western slope of the citadel of Mycenae. In both these sites the palace complex occupies the summit of the acropolis and therefore has a clear topographical superiority to that of the cult area. A sanctuary excavated lately at Phylakopi on Melos is also situated on a lower ground than the administrative building of the megaron, and as at Tiryns it lies right against the fortification wall, at the edge of the settlement.' The new archaeological data from Tiryns, Mycenae and Phylakopi has far reaching implications on the status of religious hierarchy in the Aegean during the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. A social classification of cult location recently presented by Renfrew is still far from being decisive, since he has to admit that 'the official cult place may often be within the palace, as most writers envisaged for the Cretan palaces, and some have suggested for the Mycenaean megaron. Or it can lie outside the palace, as most writers agree for the cult centre of Mycenae, and as may have been the case for the Phylakopi sanctuary... .' It has also been claimed by Renfrew that at Phylakopi (and presumably also at Tiryns) . . . 'what was, during the period of central administration, an- official cult place may continue subsequently as a popular shrine'.2 The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the status of the Phylakopi sanctuary and two cult structures from Mycenae, as attested by their location, setting and size, corresponds to several foreign elements in their architecture. As such they might be assigned to a distinctive category of 'popular' places of worship. I. Location of Cult Places as an Indicator of Status: A. TIRYNS (FIG. I): The complex of LH IIIB2 buildings discovered by Kilian in the western sector of the Lower Citadel of Tiryns does not enable us to estimate the exact nature of cult practised in * This article is a revised and extended version of a paper submitted to the Sixth International Congress of Aegean Prehistory held at Athens, 30 August-5 September, 1987. I would like to thank Prof. Elizabeth French for her most stimulating remarks while discussing various details con- cerning the cult centre of Mycenae during the congress. Abbreviations: Cult: C.

Yet, there are indications that a complete change took place in the Lower Citadel at the beginning of the Iron Age. During that period (LH IIIC), these successive shrines (R.I 17, R.IIo, R.I ioa) were built against the fortification wall (FIG. I).3 The most distinctive features of these shrines is their rear bench on which female figures with upraised arms had been installed.4 Relying on their architectural and contextual affinities to small cult edifices from post-palatial Crete, it has already been suggested by Renfrew that the Tiryns shrines are to be classified as 'popular' places of worship. The location of these shrines and the date of their construction seem to support this suggestion, since it is presumed that the palace on the Upper Citadel had already ceased to function as an administrative centre at that period.5 B. MYCENAE (FIG. 2): Elizabeth French has rightly claimed that the layout of the LH IIIB cult centre established on the western slope of the citadel of Mycenae must be studied in relation to the topography of the site.6 Reevaluation of the old data in light of new discoveries at the cult centre reveals, according to her view, that two complexes of cult structures had existed in this area at the closing phase of the Bronze Age.7 The first complex (FIG. 2: I-2) consists of the Megaron and Tsountas' House Shrine located on the upper terrace. The second complex (FIG. 2: 3-4) includes the Temple (also designated Room with the Platforms) and the House of Frescoes (to be designated as such after its Room with the Fresco), discovered by Lord William Taylour on the lower terrace. It has been assumed that a processional way connected the palace on the acropolis with the cult structures of the upper complex.8 The course of this way, which had presumably followed the contours of the slope, is unknown. Yet, its last section (FIG. 2: 5), recently excavated by Mylonas, leads to a spacious enclosure (FIG. 2: 6) that gives access to the Megaron (FIG. 2: I) and terminates in front of Tountas' House Shrine (FIG. 2: 2). The lower complex of cult structures (FIG. 2: 3-4) could be reached by a steep path (FIG. 2:7), furnished with a monumental staircase (only part of which seems to have been preserved), that departs from the processional way (FIG. 2:5) and descends along the rear wall of Tsountas House (FIG. 2: 8). Relying on the topographical superiority of the upper complex and on the impressive processional way leading to it, it is tempting to suggest that the Megaron and Tsountas' House Shrine possessed a higher religious status than that of the Temple and of the House of Frescoes located in the lowermost terrace of the citadel. Other factors, such as size, layout and architectural affinities, seem to support this suggestion (see below II:A, and III:A). C. PHYLAKOPI (FIGS. 3-4): The sanctuary excavated by Renfrew at Phylakopi is a composite structure (FIG. 3), consisting of a major temple (the West Shrine) and a subsidiary shrine (the East Shrine). 3 This figure shows the architectural remains of the last phase of LH IIIC, see also K. Kilian, 'Zeugnisse mykenischer Kultaiisubung in Tiryns', Sanctuaries 53 abb. 2 (LHIIIB2) and abb. 8 (second phase of LH IIIC). 4 For the plan of these shrines and their contents, see ibid. 53-7 abb. 4-7, 9. 5 Cult 401-2, 405-6. 6 E.

Sketch plan of the Sanctuary of Phylakopi (after C. Renfrew, 'The Sanctuary at Phylakopi' in Sanctuaries fig. I). Three main phases of construction, ranging from the mid-I14th to the late 12th centuries BC, have been distinguished in the stratigraphical sequence of this sanctuary (FIG. 4).9 During LH IIIA2-LH IIIBI it comprised only of the West Shrine (Phases Ib-ic). The East Shrine had been attached to the major temple in LH IIIB2 (Phase 2a), and both shrines continued to be used till the middle of LH IIIC (Phase 3c). There are indications, however, that drastic changes took place in the layout of the West Shrine at the beginning of the third phase (Phase 3a), after a severe collapse that occurred at the close of the second phase (Phase 2b). The southern half of the West Shrine had to be sealed off after the collapse, and as a result it roughly corresponded, in its reduced size, to that of the East Shrine. Renfrew has demonstrated that proper interpretation of the nature of cult practised at the sanctuary during the last phase of its existence depends on the history of the Mycenaean megaron at Phylakopi. The erection of the megaron took place shortly before that of the sanctuary, but concrete evidence for the date in which the megaron went out of use is unfortunately lacking. Renfrew tends to suggest that this date corresponds to that of the collapse at the sanctuary, and thus to link the definite decline of the latter 'with the destruction of the palace and the ending of a strongly centralised rule on the island'.'o If this suggestion is accepted, the sanctuary of Phylakopi in the post-palatial period can be regarded as a 'popular' cult place, and as such its status might accord well with that of the LH IIIC shrines at Tiryns (see above A). The status of the sanctuary before the collapse is enigmatic too. Renfrew states further that 'To the best of our present understanding it was the only complex of buildings in the town dedicated to the practice of cult at this time... . The existence of this special complex must clearly indicate a definite decision during the Late Helladic IIIA period, 9 Cult 71-87, 365-85 tables 3.1, 3.3- 'o Ibid. 391.</page><page sequence="6">344 ORA NEGBI lb lc E B C A F 0 'a (G H7- 2a/2b 3b 3c 'J ,,.. ~6"' L FIG. 4.

Yet 'its scale is modest . . .' and 'the position of the sanctuary on the site is as unassuming as is its scale'." Additional data, including spatial and architectural characteristics suggest, according to my view, that the status of the Phylakopi sanctuary in the first and second phases of its construction, corresponds to that of the lower complex of structures in the cult centre at Mycenae (see below II: B).

The validity of this assumption shall be tested now in light of the spatial relation between the pair of structures assigned to each of these complexes. a. The Megaron and Tsountas' House Shrine: The pairing of these structures (FIG. 2: I-2) is supported by the fact that both of them share the same enclosure in which the processional way came to an end (FIG. 2: 5-6). The spatial relation between the Megaron and Tsountas' House Shrine indicates, however, that besides being the larger among the two, the architectural quality of the former building surpasses that of the latter building. It has already been shown by French that the ground plan and the masonry style of the Megaron recall Mycenaean palatial buildings.12 However, the function of this building is difficult to ascertain, since no finds have been recorded from it. On the other hand evidence for elaborate religious ceremonies is attested by the monumental altars (including the LH IIIBI bolster altar and the LH IIIB2 remains of a square altar) discovered in Tsountas' House Shrine."' Relying on the architectural affinities of this shrine to Mycenean royal chapels, such as the one situated north-east of the Palace of Pylos,'4 it can safely be assumed that Tsountas' House Shrine possessed an official status. 12 French, op.cit.

The Temple and the House of Frescoes: Taylour has claimed recently that the sacred areas of the two adjacent cult buildings on the lower terrace (FIG. 2: 3-4) 'are contiguous but there was no direct communication between them. ... .'. South-west of the Temple (FIG. 2:3) there is large courtyard (FIG. 2:9), where Mylonas has uncovered sacrificial remains, including a circular altar covered with ashes. The House of Frescoes (FIG. 2:4) could be approached from a small area north of it, which lies close to the fortification wall (FIG. 2:Io, designated as Anteroom in FIG. 5). The irregular setting of the two structures and the storing area which separates them (designated as Workshop? on FIG. 5), might add more credence to the assumption that in spite of their topographical relationship, there is no spatial justification to pair the Temple with the House of Frescoes.'6 However, Taylour's suggestion that the more important of the two appears to have been the Temple, can be questioned, since their size is approximately the same (FIG. 5).17 Taylour has noted further that the layout of the House of Frescoes bears little resemblance to that of the adjacent Temple. Yet, both structures share several architectural affinities that justify, according to my view, their classification in the same category of 'popular' cult places (see below, III:A). B. PHYLAKOPI (FIGS. 3-4): The stratigraphical sequence of the Phylakopi sanctuary (FIG. 3), indicates that during the second and third phases of its construction it consisted of a pair of attached structures that shared a common courtyard (FIG. 4: Phases 2a-3c). Relying on spatial considerations it is quite apparent that the status of the West Shrine, the first to be built on the site (FIG. 4: Phases Ib-Ic), was higher than that of the East Shrine, at least till the collapse. After the collapse, however, the West Shrine seems to have lost its original status as the major temple and it is highly probable that at the last phase of the sanctuary's lifespan (FIG. 4: Phases 3b-3c) both shrines possessed an approximately equal degree of importance (see above, I:C). The location and size of the sanctuary makes it likely, however, that the single shrine of the first phase, like the double shrines of the second and third phases, should be classified as 'popular', rather than as 'official' places of worship (see above, I:C). If this suggestion is correct, it implies that the status of the Phylakopi sanctuary during the entire lifespan of its existence (mid 14th-late 12th centuries BC), corresponds to that of the Temple and the House of Frescoes at Mycenae in the I3th century BC, as well as to that of the Tiryns shrines in the I2th century BC (see above, I:A-B, and II: A, b). It must be emphasized, however, that unlike the Tiryns shrines, or the Megaron and Tsountas' House Shrine from Mycenae (see above, I:C, and II:A, a), the Phylakopi sanctuary has no counterparts in the Aegean. Yet van Leuven and Renfrew have shown that the spatial setting of the sanctuary of the second phase (LH IIIB and early LH IIIC) has close affinities to that of Temples 1-2 at Kition on Cyprus, dating to the Early Iron Age (FIG. 15 Mycenaeans 49; The pairing of Tsountas' House Shrine with Lord William Taylour's Temple, as suggested by van Leuven, Mainland 141 fig. 2:2, has neither topographical nor spatial justifications. 16 See Mycenaeans 49, 55, 6i; French, op. cit. (see n. 6 above) 45, 48-9 fig. i. 17 Mycenaeans 49, 55; Prof. French has told me that she feels as if the more important of the two appears to have been the House of Frescoes. It seems likely that both struc- tures had the same degree of importance, but the cult practised in them was different, see below, IV:A.</page><page sequence="9">LEVANTINE ELEMENTS IN THE SACRED ARCHITECTURE OF THE AEGEAN 347 7).18 Mazar has demonstrated further that the double sanctuaries of Phylakopi and Kition recall two successive pairs of Philistine temples discovered by him at Tell Qasile on the central coast of Israel (FIG. 8).19 As at Phylakopi, the complexes at Kition and Qasile consist also of major and minor buildings attached to one another. Yet there is a spatial difference between the double complexes of Kition and Qasile. Temples 1-2 at Kition (FIG. 7) share a common courtyard (Temenos B). At tell Qasile each building has a separate courtyard (FIG. 8). In this respect the sanctuary of Phylakopi (FIG. 3) is closer to Kition than to Qasile. Chronological data from the three sites indicate that the double sanctuary of Phylakopi founded in the I3th century Bc (Phase 2a, see above I:C) preceded those of Kition and Qasile. Temples 1-2 from Kition were combined into a composite Sanctuary in the I2th century BC (Floor III), and the two successive pairs of temples from Qasile (Strata XI-X) date to the I Ith century Bc.20 The fact that the Qasile temples are the latest in the series has been taken as one of the substantive clues for the assumption that the model of a double sanctuary was introduced by the Philistines to Tell Qasile from the Aegean via Cyprus (see below, III:B). Van Leuven's suggestion that sanctuaries, consisting of a major temple and a subsidiary shrine, have a long history in the sacred architecture of the Greek mainland, is invalid for Phylakopi, Kition and Qasile, since most of his supposed pairs consist of detached rather than of attached structures.21 On the other hand, pairs of attached and detached structures, occasionally sharing the same temenos, appear in the Near East from the late 4th millennium Bc onwards. Suffice to mention here are Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age temples from Megiddo in Israel;22 Middle and Late Bronze Age temples from Ras Shamra-Ugarit and Emar-Meskene in Syria,23 as well as temples 4-5 from Kition on Cyprus dating to the Early Iron Age (FIG. 7).24 It is noteworthy, however, that the examples listed here are twin-temples where deities of equal status seem to have been worshipped. In this respect they differ from the major and minor components of the double sanctuaries at Phylakopi, Kition (Temples 1-2) and Qasile (FIGS. 3, 7-8), that were presumably reserved to deities of major and minor status (see below, IV:C).25 '8 Mainland 141, 144-5; Cult 407-9, 412; Cyprus 94-8 (floor III) 19 Qasile 21-4, 66-8 figs. 6-11 (Strata XI-X). 20 See n. i8-i9 above. It is noteworthy that Temple 2 from Kition originally belonged to a pair of detached temples (Temples 2-3), dating to LCII C (Floor IV), see Cyprus 94-8 fig. 72; At the first period of its construction Temple 2 was the major building, but during the following periods of its use it became the minor building of a new complex (Temples 1-2).

The pairing of the major and minor megara of Tiryns has been challenged by Kilian, contra van Leuven, op. cit. 24:# 52; 26. The assumption that royal cult was practised in the palace complex of Pylos is also controversial, see G.

Architectural Features of Diagnostic Religious Function: Relying on spatial considerations it has been assumed that the Temple and the House of Frescoes from Mycenae are to be regarded as two separated cult complexes. Comparative study of their architecture indicates, however, that each of them bears close affinities to one of the shrines of the Phylakopi sanctuary. A. PHYLAKOPI AND MYCENAE (FIGS. 3-6): a. The West Shrine at Phylakopi and the Temple of Mycenae: Renfrew has already pointed out that the West Shrine of Phylakopi and the Temple discovered by Lord William Taylour at Mycenae share several distinctive features.26 Unlike other axial cult structures of the same size, such as Tsountas' House Shrine (see above II:A, a), their adyton is not located at the farmost part of the building, but rather along the rear wall of the cella. In addition to the storerooms installed at the farmost part of the Phylakopi shrine (FIG. 3:A-B) and the Mycenae Temple (FIG. 5: Room with the Idols), there are other elements in their cellae that have no parallels elsewhere in the Aegean. FIG. 6. Isometric reconstruction of the Temple of Mycenae (after Mycenaeans fig. 26). 26 Cult 407-9.</page><page sequence="11">LEVANTINE ELEMENTS IN THE SACRED ARCHITECTURE OF THE AEGEAN 349 The layout of the Phylakopi shrine is basically symmetrical (FIG. 3), yet careful examination of its plan reveals that the original building (FIG. 4: Phase I b) had two doors, one at the east, opposite the pair of platforms that flank the entrance to the storerooms, the other door at the south, subsequently blocked as a part of an overhaul that took place in the adjacent fortifications with the erection of the extension wall (FIG. 4: Phase I c). The symmetry of the shrine (FIG. 4: Phases Ic-2a- 2b) was severely irrupted after the collapse, when its southern half had to be sealed off. At that date a new platform was erected in the north-east corner, presumably in order to replace the one in the south-west corner (FIG. 4: Phase 3b).27 The main room of the Temple at Mycenae (FIG. 5: Room with the Platforms, FIG. 6), as vividly described by Taylour, has 'many unusual architectural features ... Across the far end of the room is a line of narrow platforms that differ in height and dimensions. They adjoin one another but without recognizable symmetry of plan. One platform in the north-west corner is higher than the others and on different axis ... On the highest platform to the east stood a large female idol modelled in clay, about 6o cm. high. She faces the west towards the highest platform in the opposite corner of the room. . ... Anyone standing in the entrance would not see her as she was obscured from view by a tall, wooden column, one of three in line that supported the roof. These columns were not placed, as one would expect, on the long axis of the room but over to the east side of it'.28 The Temple of Mycenae has thus yielded several architectural features that do not appear in the West Shrine at Phylakopi. It seems likely, however, that unusual features, such as the location of the columns and the steps that lead up to a little storeroom in which many clay idols were found (FIG. 5: Room of the Idols, FIG. 6) are due to topographical factors rather than to the original plan of the building.29 b. The East Shrine of Phylakopi and the House of Frescoes at Mycenae: The East Shrine of Phylakopi (FIG. 3) is a small, rectangular room that was added to the sanctuary at the second phase of its construction (FIG. 4: Phases 2a/2b). By contrast to the symmetrical layout of Aegean bench-shrines, such as those of Tiryns (see above I:A), the Phylakopi shrine has two assymmetrical features: a corner, 'bent-axis' approach and a small platform installed in the farmost corner (FIG. 4: Phases 2a/2b- 3b).3o The main room of the House of Frescoes (FIG. 5: Room with the Fresco) at Mycenae is distinguished by the very same architectural features: a 'bent-axis' access from the north-west and a platform at the south-east corner, on which remains of a fresco have been found (see below, IV:A). Unlike the East Shrine, however, this house has two additional rooms (FIG. 5: designated as Shrine and Storeroom?) that were probably used for storing cult objects.31 27 On the architectural sequence of this shrine, see Ibid. 73-89; and n. 5 above. 28 Mycenaeans 49-50 fig. 24. 29 The exposed rock of the Alcove was concealed by a wall, but since the Room with the Idols was built on a higher terrain than the Room with the Platforms, there was no other way but to build the stairs that led to the former room at the farmost corner of the latter room, see ibid. 50, 52, and French, op. cit. (n. 6 above) 45. Prof. French has told me that the need to lay the row of columns in alignment with the steps was probably due to statical reasons, since the eastern wall of the Temple that abutted the terrace was not strong enough, in her opinion, in order to support the roof. 30 A new platform was installed off the corner in the last phase of its existence (fig. 4: Phase 3c). On the architectu- ral sequence of this shrine, see Cult, 72-7 and n.9 above. 31 Mycenaeans 55, 58-9 PLATE 32; On the function of the eastern room designated as Shrine, see French, op. cit. (see n. 6 above) 45; Cult 408. I was told by Prof. French that a bench, which according to Lord William Taylour was attached to the southern wall of the Room with the Fresco and terminated at the platform, is not actually a bench, but a later architectural element that did not belong to the original layout of the room.</page><page sequence="12">350 ORA NEGBI B. ARCHITECTURAL PARALLELS OVERSEAS (FIGS. 7-IO): Mazar has already noticed that some of the unusual features attested in cult structures of Mycenae and Phylakopi appear also in the Philistine sanctuary of Tell Qasile (see above, II:B). a. The Philistine affinities: The major temple of the latest Philistine sanctuary (FIG. 8), which extended from two earlier structures,32 has an ante room, a main hall and a store room. In this respect its layout is closer to that of the Mycenae Temple (FIG. 5) than to that of the West Shrine of Phylakopi (FIG. 3). The similarity between the temples of Mycenae and Qasile becomes quite apparent when their isometric reconstructions are compared (FIGS. 6, 9). As at Mycenae (and the Phylakopi West Shrine) the storeroom of Qasile is also located at the rear. Both structures have a row of columns and a series of platforms in the main hall, but the inner arrangement of the hall at Qasile is more or less symmetrical (see above A, a).

The resemblance of the subsidiary shrine of Qasile (FIG. 8) to the East Shrine of Phylakopi (FIGS. 3-4) is even more striking.33 Both shrines consist of a single room which has a 'bent-axis' approach and a small, corner platform. As demonstrated above these two features are diagnostic to the House of Frescoes at Mycenae (FIG. 5). The importance of the corner platforms has also been attested in the adjacent Temple at Mycenae and the West Shrine of Phylakopi (see above A, b).34 A 'bent-axis' approach that characterizes both shrines of the Qasile sanctuary (FIGS. 8-9), is recorded in two temples (Temples 3, 5) at Kition as well.35 It is noteworthy that in both sites the subsidiary shrines do not belong to the original phase of construction.

Mazar was well aware of the fact that the Qasile sanctuary is of a later date than its Aegean and Cypriot counterparts. Yet, relying on exhaustive comparative data, he has assumed that the layout of this sanctuary evolved from local, Canaanite forerunners and was not introduced by the Philistines from overseas (see above, II:B).36 b. The Canaanite Foreruuners: It has been demonstrated by Mazar that diagnostic features, such as platforms, benches, columns, storerooms and indirect approach to the holy-of-holies characterize a distinctive type of small and medium-size temples with 'irregular plan' that have a long history in the Near East.37 Middle Bronze Age representatives of this type include single room buildings with 'bent-axis' entrances, such as the temples of Tell Chuera in the north Syrian desert and Nahariya on the northern coast of Israel. Another temple, recently excavated by Stern at Tel Mevorakh, on the coastal plain of Israel, south of Haifa, can be added to this type.38 The original building of Tel Mevorakh, which dates to the initial phase of the Late 36 See Qasile 62-68; and J.D.

At a later phase of this period a storeroom was built behind its rear wall. The entrance has not been found, but there are indications that it was located near the south-east corner, presumably on the southern wall.39 Yet, the author believes that the most distinctive feature of the Tel Mevorakh temple lies in the location of its holy-of-holies. The tradition of placing a cult image of the deity or its emblem on a platform or a bench at the centre of the rear wall, opposite the entrance, is the very essential feature of symmetrical temples in the Aegean and the East.40 It is noteworthy, however, that many Near Eastern cult structures with 'irregular plan', such as the Early and Middle Bronze Age temples or Tell Asmar and Tell Chuera, or the Late Bronze Age Fosse Temple from Lachish, have also their platform located in the same place.41 Unlike these temples, however, the stepped platform of Tel Mevorakh is located in the farmost corner of the room, which was apparently visible from the entrance at the opposite corner (FIG. IO). In this respect the Tell Mevorakh Temple can be regarded as the closest forerunner of the Temple and the House of Frescoes from Mycenae (FIGS. 5-6) and of the subsidiary shrines of Phylakopi and Tell Qasile (FIGS. 3-4, 8). Relying on its location, layout and size the Tel Mevorakh temple has been classified by Stern in a distinctive category of 'Sanctuaries located beside roads and highways . . . 'that '... seem to have been intended for use by travellers who probably visited them while passing by . .'42 Since most of the temples of this category are recorded from coastal sites, such as Tell Abu Hawam, Tel Mevorakh and Jaffa, their architectural influence on Cypriote and Aegean cult edifices can easily be explained.43 IV. The Nature of Cult Practised at Mycenae and Phylakopi: The assumption that Canaanite elements of focal religious significance, such as the holy-of-holies, have certain impact on the sacred architecture of the Aegean at the closing phase of the Bronze Age, does not necessarily imply that the function of the platforms at Mycenae and Phylakopi corresponds to that of their forerunners in the Levant. A. THE HOUSE OF FRESCOES AT MYCENAE: The corner platform installed in the main room of this building (FIG. 5: Room with the Fresco) has been identified by Lord William Taylour as an altar. Two fresco fragments, the first painted on the north face of the platform and the second - on the wall facing it, seem to support his suggestion.44 Of the first fragment three pairs of 'horns of consecration' surmounting a row of discs have survived. Depicted on the second fragment is a woman 39 Ibid. 28-30 figs. 23-5. 40 On the raised platform in Bronze Age temples from the Near East, see for example P.

The composition of the two fragments recalls one of the scenes portrayed on the Ayia Triadha sarcophagus, which shows a woman, presumably a priestess, engaged in a certain ritual of libation and/or offering performed on a low podium, in front of a shrine.45 The horns of consecration and a series of discs (presumably signifying wooden beams) depicted on this shrine closely resemble those painted on the face of the platform at Mycenae. However, since the height of the platform corresponds to that of the podium on the sarcophagus, it is logical to regard it as an altar or an offering table. Small depressions with ashes recorded from the top of the platform,46 might hint to the possibility that it served as an incense altar as well. Substantial evidence for burning is attested by the elliptical hearth installed in the centre of the room (FIG. 5), but it seems unlikely that it was used for sacrificial purposes. On the other hand, it is quite probable that the clay larnax and several pottery vessels found at the other end of the room, near the entrance, were connected with purification, or 'bath ritual', as suggested by Taylour.47 Furthermore, comparison of the small finds from the House of Frescoes to those of the adjacent Temple, fully supports his assumption that '. both the conception of the buildings and the nature of cult practised in each were entirely different' (see above, II:A, b).48 B. THE TEMPLE AT MYCENAE AND THE WEST SHRINE OF PHYLAKOPI: Unlike the corner altar in the House of Frescoes, the platforms of the Temple at Mycenae and of the West Shrine at Phylakopi apparently served as a dais for placing clay figures of distinctive Aegean types.49 In this respect both structures bear closer affinities to the 45 C.R.

The bulk of cult paraphernalia recorded from the Temple and the West Shrine was discovered in the storerooms.50 Yet, three female figures were found in-situ on the platforms: two were placed on the south-west platform of the West Shrine (FIG. 4), and one - on the north-east platform adjacent to the staircase in the Mycenae temple (FIG. 6).51 It seems likely, however, that the pair of corner platforms used at the West Shrine at Phylakopi prior to the collapse (FIG. 4: Phase 2b), and the series of platforms installed along the rear wall of the Temple of Mycenae (FIGS. 5-6), did not have exactly the same function. The platforms of the former building are of the same height, while those of the latter are of varying heights. Assuming that the human figures placed on them are cult statues, which is of course a matter of controversy (see below, C), it has been legitimate for Taylour to suggest that the stepped platforms of the Temple '... perhaps indicate the status of the deities in the hierarchy?'.52 However, since only one of the figures from the temple was found in position, such a suggestion remains in the realm of speculation. In this respect, the picture that emerges from the West Shrine seems more decisive. The assemblages of terracottas that can be safely assigned to the two platforms which were in use till the collapse (FIG. 4: Phases 2a/2b, A-B), are of different composition. Unlike the south-west platform that yielded only female figures, the repertory of artefacts that were spread around the foot of north-west platform (and that are presumed to have fallen down when the collapse took place), consists of male figures, chariots and animal figures.53 Relying on the contextual date, it seems likely that each platform was reserved for figures of deities and/or human votaries of different sexes (see below). C. THE WEST AND EAST SHRINES OF THE PHYLAKOPI SANCTUARY: The nature of cult practised at the Phylakopi sanctuary is still an enigma. Van Leuven's suggestion that 'The very pairing of shrines in a double sanctuary could show that they shared a specific cult, and indeed that the divinity involved was thought to alternate between them, most formally moving from the shrine which held its primary worship to visit the shrine which did not',54 does not correspond to the paraphernalia of the Phylakopi shrines. Contextual comparison between the two shrines at the end of the second phase of their existence (FIG. 4: Phase 2b) shows that unlike the case of the West Shrine (see above, B) the platform area of the East Shrine yielded ' . . . no substantial human figures or figurines ... There are several substantial fragments of a chariot group . .. and an almost complete driven ox ... as well as numerous animal figurines'.55 50 For the contents of the Room with the Idols of the Temple and rooms A-B of the West Shrine, see Mycenaeans 50-1; Cult 112-7; The only clay figure recorded from the House of Frescoes was found in the corner of the Shrine, which presumably served as a storeroom, see n,. 31, 48 above. 5' On the repertory of these platforms, see Cult 109-io: Assemblage B (Phase 2b), Mycenaeans 50. 52 Mycenaeans 53. 53 On the figures found on the former platform, see n. 51 above; on those assigned to the latter platform, see Cult o05-7: Assemblage A. It is noteworthy, however, that there is no decisive difference in the context of platforms used in the shrine after the collapse (fig. 4: Phases 3b-3c). Male, female and animal figures seem to have been placed on the north-west platform, while female and animal figures are recorded from the north-east platform, see ibid. 131-3, 135-8: Assemblages G, J, K.. 54 Mainland 145. 55 Cult 117, 119: Assemblage D. However, here as in the West Shrine, the context became mixed after the collapse (fig. 4: Phases 3b-3c), when human figures are also recorded from the East Shrine, see ibid. I29-34.</page><page sequence="18">356 ORA NEGBI Of special interest is Macfarlane's report on an analysis of join linkages of terracottas from the sanctuary, which shows that '. . . there are no direct figurine joins between the East and West Shrines. . .' On the other hand, 'The joins from both shrines into the street and courtyard ... are the main key to correlating the sequences of use proposed for each shrine... ' Furthermore, the open areas around the shrines appear to 'have been used as dump during the clearing out operations from both shrines'.56 Relying on this analysis it seems likely that the complete lack of human terracottas from the East Shrine is not accidental. Taking into account the context of metal objects from the sanctuary, I tend to accept Renfrew's suggestion that a head of sheet gold recorded from Phase 3c context in the East Shrine was originally attached to a bronze figurine of a Smiting God discovered on the extension wall.57 A second bronze figurine of a Smiting God assigned to Phase 2b that was found in a well stratified position east of the East Shrine,"5 may support the assumption that the two figurines originated in the East Shrine, where they were presumably used before the collapse. The context of anthropomorphic effigies from both shrines might give us a clue to the 'nationality' of the deities worshipped in each of them. The status of the terracotta male figures in the Aegean is still a matter of speculation,59 yet Renfrew's suggestion ' . . . that all the large female figures in the Aegean originally served as cult figures in shrines',60 seems fairly logical. If this suggestion is correct, it implies that the distinctive Aegean goddess with upraised arms was worshipped in the West Shrine, while the cult of a foreign, Semitic god in smiting pose, took place in the subsidiary East Shrine of the same sanctuary.61 V. Summary and Conclusions: The aim of this paper was to demonstrate that a distinctive type of Canaanite temples, recently classified as 'road' temples, had certain impact on the architecture of three 'popular' cult places from the Aegean. The Canaanite temples dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, that prevailed in maritime trading posts and harbour sites, are small and medium-size buildings with 'irregular plan'. By contrast to the symmetrical layout of monumental city temples of the same periods, in which official cult was practised, the most diagnostic feature of the 'road' temples is the indirect access ('bent-axis' approach) to the holy-of-holies (a platform installed at the centre, or in the corner of the rear wall). The sanctuary discovered by Renfrew at Phylakopi on Melos and two adjacent structures excavated by Lord William Taylour on the lowest terrace of the Citadel of Mycenae, are of modest dimensions. Like other cult places of the same category, such as the bench-shrines of Tiryns, they too are located on low terrain at the edge of the city. Yet, 56" C.

The Canaanite elements attested in the cult structures of Phylakopi and Mycenae, seem to correspond to the influx of Canaanite bronze figurines in the East Mediterranean during the 14-I3th centuries BC. At that period contacts between the Aegean, Cyprus and the Levant had reached their peak. It is, therefore, quite possible that Canaanite traders are to be held responsible for the introduction of architectural models and cult effigies to harbour towns on Cyprus (Kition and Enkomi) and the Cyclades (Phylakopi) as well as to major citadels in the Greek mainland (Mycenae). There are indications, however, that Canaanite temples and deities were not deliber- ately accepted in the Aegean at the closing phase of the Bronze Age. The corner platform that served as an altar in the House of Frescoes at Mycenae, like the terracotta figures placed on the stepped and corner platforms of the adjacent Temple at Mycenae and the major shrine (West Shrine) of the Phylakopi sanctuary, are distinctively Aegean. Yet, the minor shrine (East Shrine) attached to the major shrine of the Phylakopi sanctuary, is a single room chapel that has to be classified in a special category of 'popular' cult places. Relying on its layout and size this chapel can be looked upon as a miniature version of Canaanite 'road' temples like the one found recently at the coastal trading post of Tel Mevorakh. Since the only cult effigies recorded from this chapel are two bronze figurines of a distinctive Levantine type, it is tempting to suggest that the minor shrine of Phylakopi was reserved for foreign cult that was presumably practised by Canaanite seafarers engaged in East Mediterranean trade.
