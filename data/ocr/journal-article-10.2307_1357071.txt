Box 2470, Jebel Amman Amman, Jordan INTRODUCTION In 1974 highway construction near the north- eastern outskirts of Amman cut through the eastern fringes of a major Neolithic settle- ment that had lain undisturbed for some 9,000 years. In subsequent years rapid economic devel- opment continued to eat away at the edges of the site, and by late 1981 ten percent or more of the southern, northern, and eastern periphery had been thoroughly destroyed. In the autumn of that year, alerted to the devastation of a major prehis- toric resource, the Department of Antiquities of Jordan invoked legal means to halt further dam- age and arranged to conduct emergency rescue operations to salvage information from areas re- cently exposed by commercial activity. Because of the dangers posed in the imminent rainy season, it was necessary to assemble an archaeological staff quickly; and fortunately a small but experienced international cadre was resident in Amman at the time.' Excavations were conducted for four weeks in January and five weeks in March and April of 1982. THE SITE The Early Neolithic community of 'Ain Ghazal ("Spring of the Gazelle") is located on the west bank of the Wadi Zarqa, the longest drainage sys- tem in highland Jordan. The Zarqa River is a permanent stream fed by springs in the Amman area and farther downstream. 'Ain Ghazal is one of these permanent freshwater sources, situated near the confluence of the Zarqa River with two major tributary wadis. For much of its upper reaches, the Wadi Zarqa is a relatively steep- sided, canyon-like feature; but at CAin Ghazal a small and shallow basin opens on the western side of the drainage, and it is in this "microembay- ment" that the ancient village was established. Topographically and geographically, the site of 'Ain Ghazal sits at a nexus of a heavily dissected range of jebels (low mountains, in this case) to the north, west, and south and more open rolling hills and plains to the northeast and east. The tops of the jebels are broad and gently sloping, capable of supporting rainfall agriculture today. The undu- lating countryside to the east is near the limits of dry farming, consisting generally of open dry grassland at present except for garden patches in small wadis. SITE SURVEY While excavations proceeded in the heavily dis- turbed areas on the eastern fringes of the village, a small team conducted a survey of the site to determine the extent of cultural evidence in the immediate vicinity. Exposures of architectural features in roadcuts and sections left from com- mercial activity revealed that houses extended across a distance of 600 m north to south, and concentrated distributions of flint artifacts on the ground surface reached from the highway near the wadi bottom 200 m up the hill to the west (fig. 1). In June 1982 an electronic subsurface survey, us- ing an EM-31 resistivity/conductivity monitor,2 3</page><page sequence="2">C) \ z to Sports City .7- C) 0 0 m CA 0 Ain Ghazal Topographic Survey, Jan. 1982 LEGEND C] 8nt excvation squares - 41 exposed structures iron fence woter pipe ........ field woll - - site boundary ,--~ ,- embankment r rock escorpment o oolive grove - _ _ earth channel contour intervol 2m.

The settlement, then, covers some 12 hec- tares (30 acres), roughly three times the size of contemporary Jericho. During the survey of the exposed structures in the bulldozer cuts, more than 50 buildings and 70 plaster floors were located along the N-S axis (Rollefson and Suleiman 1983). These structures appear to be clustered, with a South Cluster com- prising 25 buildings, a Central Cluster of 24 struc- tures, and a poorly defined North Cluster of six dwellings. (Much of the North Cluster area was severely damaged by road construction). The three visible clusters are separated by architectural hia- tuses of some 60-70 m, with heavy ash and rubble accumulations in these lacunae. At present there is insufficient evidence to explain this arrangement. While most of the exposed structures appear to be single or multiroomed houses ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 m in length, one building is remarkably large. Composed of four rooms of unequal size, this building extends for 15 m in the north-south direction, and it is one of the largest structures ever reported from an Early Neolithic context. Eroded artifacts from this construction are too few to provide sound indications of its function, but its size alone suggests some public rather than domestic role in the community. The western wall of the southernmost room of this building was exposed by erosion early in the rainy season of 1982-1983, indicating that the bulldozers had de- stroyed most of the structure. The wall plaster in this room is unusually thick and appears to be completely covered with red ochre. EXCAVATIONS The threat of the loss of information at many areas of the site along the roadcuts governed the selection of specific excavation units. In addition to a number of visible burial pits (below) that were rescued with small soundings, seven major excavation trenches were probed to varying areal and vertical extents, depending on the underlying sterile Pleistocene deposits and the relationships of the selected areas with the arbitrary grid im- posed on the site. Square 3067, near the southern end of the Cen- tral Cluster, contained three superimposed floors that promised uncontaminated artifactual, pollen, 5 palaeobotanical, and faunal samples. Interior architectural features, including repaired plaster floors and sunken plastered hearths, suggested the potential retrieval of preserved domestic arrange- ments. On the last day of the season a well- preserved burial pit was found beneath the lowest floor; since the pit was well protected at this depth, it was decided to excavate the burial in the 1983 season. Excavations began late in the season in Square 3068, adjacent to the north, in an at- tempt to locate the northern wall of the most re- cent floor in Square 3067 which could not be seen in the roadcut. As it turned out, the northern sec- tion of the most recent occupation had been re- moved by erosion in antiquity. The deposits in Square 3073 were among the thickest in the threatened areas of the site, provid- ing the most complete stratigraphic sequence available under the rescue nature of the 1982 sea- son. This square was selected as the Step Trench, which revealed by the end of the season a se- quence of four major occupational phases through more than 3 m of sediments. In addition, two more occupational episodes are discernible in the bulldozer cut (more than 2 m high) to the west and immediately uphill of the Step Trench, al- though the upslope location of this section makes it very difficult to make correlations with the strata of Square 3073. An exposed subfloor burial pit in Square 3079 required excavation in this area, and subsequent work eventually revealed four superimposed floors (and sunken hearths) within less than a meter of deposits. Correlated with each of the four hearths were four subfloor burial pits, revealing a cultural/ ritual relationship not reported from other con- temporary sites in the Levant. The fourth intra- mural pit was discovered on the final day of the season, but its location was well protected and could be held for excavation in the 1983 season. The burial pit in Square 3082 was among the first to be salvaged during the 1982 season, and as the season progressed it became apparent as the sediments dried out that the building in this square was contemporaneous with the one in adjacent Square 3083 (which had been selected previously for large scale exposure). The northern wall of Square 3082 is less than 60 cm from the southern wall in Square 3083; evidently these two struc- tures are elements of a tightly compacted residen- tial cluster. The building in Square 3083 is approximately 1984</page><page sequence="4">G. 0. ROLLEFSON 5 m long in the north-south dimension, but the east-west measurement is impossible to determine due to severe damage by bulldozers. This house comprises at least two rooms, adjacent east and west. The eastern room is evidently the main liv- ing quarters, with a highly burnished plaster floor mostly devoid of red ocher decoration except for several "polka dots" over the subfloor burial pit. A sunken plastered hearth is located near the cen- ter of the north-south axis, and this feature was filled with a deposit of fine gray-white ash. An alcove in the northwest corner of the room may have served as a cupboard. A 1-m doorway in the center of the common wall connects this room with the western part of the house. The floor of the western room, which has not been completely excavated, consists of a poorer quality plaster, possibly because the eastern floor was replastered after the burial. A curved bench in the western room faces the doorway, and between these two features a number of grinding stones and pounders was found on the floor. The bench may have served as a "kitchen counter," on which the residents placed containers and utensils involved with food processing. One small storage bin occurred in the northeast corner of this room, and a possible larger stone-lined storage feature may have existed to the northwest of the apsoidal bench.3 A small pit that had been dug into sterile Pleis- tocene clay was visible in the bulldozer section near the southwest corner of the car park in Square 4048 (fig. 1). Excavations here revealed that the contents of the pit consisted of fine white powder and many small blocks of burned lime- stone. Large amounts of ash extended away from the pit. The interior surfaces of the pit were dark red, and the clay had been converted to a hard, bricklike texture, attesting to relatively hot tem- peratures. It appears that this feature may have been involved with the production of lime plaster. Artifacts Tables 1-4 tabulate the artifacts retrieved from the 1982 season. For the chipped stone material, projectile points (fig. 2:b-g) comprise only 5.3 percent of the total, which is quite low in com- parison to the 24 percent figure for Beidha (Mor- tensen 1970), the only other contemporary site that has been adequately published.

Another major dif- ference between Beidha and 'Ain Ghazal is seen in the relative abundance of burins (fig. 2:i-j): 42 percent for 'Ain Ghazal, against only 4 percent for Beidha. The assumption that burins represent tools used for carving bone is contrasted by the fact that only 20 bone tools (versus 724 burins) were found at 'Ain Ghazal, even though bone preservation at the site was excellent. The use of burins for fashioning wooden implements, uten- sils, and containers may have been underestimated greatly in the past.

A cache of 84 flint blades was found beneath the floor of a house in Squares 2871/3071. None of the blades had been retouched to form a tool, nor did any show evidence of simple utilization. All of them were aligned in a north-south direc- tion and evidently had originally been wrapped with a binding of leather or some other perishable material. The cache had been buried intentionally beneath the floor, but since bulldozers removed so much of the dwelling and subfloor deposits, it cannot be determined if the cache was an individ- ual deposit or was intended as a grave offering with a subfloor human burial. The analysis of a sample of blades and flakes from 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson and Abu Ghuneima in press) shows marked typological and techno- logical differences with specialized activity sites in today's eastern deserts of Jordan (Rollefson and Frohlich 1982; Rollefson and Muheisen n.d.), which also appear to date from the PPNB period (cf. Betts 1982). These differences in technique and form imply ethnic distinctions between the settled farmers at 'Ain Ghazal and transhumant populations in the contemporary dry areas to the east. Among the ground stone objects (Table 3), most are related to the processing of plant food. While the majority of querns, mortars, and stone bowls were made of local limestone and/or sand- stone, handheld grinders were generally made of basalt, a raw material that probably came from the Mafraq area 50 km to the northeast of CAin Ghazal. Several mortar fragments indicate their use for grinding red ochre into a powder, and some of the discoidal basalt grinders also bear dis- tinct traces of this mineral. Stone bowls, contrary to their name, seem to have been used more as "widemouth mortars" than as simple containers. Two curving and tapering pieces of pecked lime- stone may have been the horns of an animal sculpture. A concentration of polished limestone bracelet or circular pendant fragments (fig. 3:j-k) came from a disturbed context in the vicinity of Square 4048, and this possibly reflects a special- ized manufacturing locus analogous to the "shops" in Level II/III at Beidha (Kirkbride 1966). Several of the objects listed in Table 4 indicate long-distance trade contacts. A broken obsidian knife (fig. 2:h) must trace its ultimate origins back to Anatolia or Iran. Three greenstone beads (fig. 3:c-d) appear to be of a copper ore, possibly from the Wad? Dana region of southern Jordan. 1984 9</page><page sequence="8">G. 0. ROLLEFSON TABLE 4.

A carnelian bead (fig. 3:b), as well as a small piece of unworked carnelian, come from an uncertain area, perhaps from Nubian sandstone outcrops in the southern part of Jordan or from the Negev region of Palestine. Cockle shells and sweet clams originated on the Mediterranean coast; each of these shells had a single perforation at the hinge end and they may have been worn as pendants, although the perforations probably resulted from natural abrasion on the shore. Finally, three stones are stained with what appears to be bitumen, obtainable from the Dead Sea shore. Some of the most important finds of the season included fragments of plaster bowls, palettes, plat- ters, and troughs. Such "white-ware" is common in Syrian and Lebanese sites of the Early Neo- lithic, but it is absent in Palestine and southern Jordan. This places 'Ain Ghazal near the interface of two possible major culture areas in the Levant. Thirteen clay figurines of stylized animals came to light during the season. Nine were not fired and were in a crumbly state of preservation, although sufficient features remained intact to reveal their representative nature. One of these bore traces of red ochre on the rump. Four of the figurines had been baked, perhaps accidentally, and therefore were well preserved. Two of these seem to repre- sent wild cattle, the third is a juvenile animal (fig. 4:a), and the fourth could be one of several different species. Two small, delicate animal horns of fired clay were also discovered, but what ani- mals they represent is impossible to determine. One small fragment of baked clay may be part of a human figurine, but there is too little of the original piece left to be certain. A small plaster human statuette, approximately 6 cm high, was found in the disturbed area near the lime-burning pit in Square 4048 (fig. 4:b). A relative abundance of geometric objects made of clay, fired and unfired, also came from 'Ain Ghazal. Discs, cones, cylinders, and balls have been mentioned as possible early forms of record- keeping (Schmandt-Besserat 1982), and in view of the size of 'Ain Ghazal's population and area, coupled with the 15-m "public building," this aspect deserves more research. One piece is par- ticularly odd: a flat slab of clay was evidently 0 3cm. 0 3 cm. I Fig. 4. Figurines from CAin Ghazal: (a) Fired clay animal figurines; (b) back (right) and front views of plaster human statuette. (Photos by B. Byrd) pressed over the thumb pad to form a small dish- shaped object, after which the outer surface was repeatedly rocker-stamped with a fine-toothed tool or a serrated-edged shell before firing (fig. 3:h). Its function is not known at this time. Human Burials Fifteen burial pits were located during the 1982 season at 'Ain Ghazal, three of them on the last day of field work; these, as well as another sub- floor burial beneath more than 3 m of deposits, could not be excavated until the 1983 season. Eleven burials, containing a total of thirteen indi- viduals, were excavated. The "population" con- sisted of three adult males (aged late 20s to early 50s at death), four adult females (middle teens to early 40s), two children, and four infants. One burial included a woman in her late teens, who had suffered from a congenital hip defect, and a newborn infant: evidently both had died in child- birth. With one exception, the burials were tightly 11 1984</page><page sequence="10">G. 0. ROLLEFSON flexed and lying on the side, buried beneath housefloors. The exception was a young woman who had been thrown headlong, apparently, into a hole dug in a trash pit outside the 15-m building. This case involving a singular lack of respect after death suggests the possibility that two classes of people may have lived at CAin Ghazal. The woman may have been a slave or a person who had no house of her own. On the other hand, it is pos- sible that the circumstances of her interment cor- respond to some judgment passed on a violation of cultural norms in the community. An important cultural rule concerning burials became apparent early in the season. Whenever enough of the floor remained after bulldozer damage, the subfloor burial was located within 1.5 m to the south of the sunken plastered hearth. This was confirmed in Square 3079, where four superimposed sunken hearths were found just to the north of four burial pits. This aspect seems to have been followed from the earliest occupational phases at 'Ain Ghazal, and the predictability of this rule will greatly aid future excavations of undisturbed dwellings. Domestic Economy sion in the 'Ain Ghazal deposits, although ac- cumulated garbage probably explains the relative abundance of rodent bones. The kinds of small carnivores represent mutually antagonistic envi- ronments and emphasize the ecotonal nature of 'Ain Ghazal's location. In terms of plant foods, only a small number of flotation samples have been analyzed; and in view of the probable sampling error little attention should be paid to the relative abundance of identi- fied charred remains. These include in decreasing order of recognized quantity: domestic(?) peas and lentils, domestic(?) barley, possible wheat (domestic?), and possible chickpea. The sediments at the site are particularly rich in charred plant remains, and future analysis should provide a comprehensive picture of this facet of the diet of the people of 'Ain Ghazal. If the hierarchy of plant remains follows the order described above, it would point to major differences in farming practices within the Levant. Environmental and ecological differences, especially in the wet and fertile banks of the permanent river at CAin Ghazal, might explain such major variations. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS The deposits at CAin Ghazal are rich in pre- served animal remains. Dr. Ilse K6hler, the staff zooarchaeologist, notes that more than 4,000 bones were identifiable from the small-scale efforts of 1982. This contrasts with a total of 700 from contemporary Jericho and approximately 7,000 identifiable bones from all of the seasons at Beidha. 'Ain Ghazal promises to be an excellent source of information for documenting the in- creasing cultural control exercised by Early Neo- lithic peoples over domesticable animals. The majority of animal bones from the site are from goats, although the degree of domestication remains to be resolved. Sheep are minimally pres- ent, and the degree of cultural control over this species also remains to be determined by future research. Hunting wild animals still played an important role in the diet of CAin Ghazal inhabit- ants; gazelle, especially, constituted the second most abundant resource. Wild cattle, equids, and pigs were in a distinct minority. Small carnivore bones were relatively numerous, especially fox. Charred fox bones, some with butchering marks, indicate a human dietary reason for their inclu- The emergency salvage nature of the 1982 sea- son at 'Ain Ghazal restricted the excavations to a series of isolated trenches and probes that remain stratigraphically uncorrelated due to the complex natural and cultural deposition at this huge site. Many features at 'Ain Ghazal echo Early Neo- lithic development throughout the Levant, espe- cially in terms of architectural features, chipped stone tool styles, and general economy. In other aspects, CAin Ghazal shows cultural affinities with the northern part of the Levant, especially in the use of plaster for containers and utensils. Although intramural burials are common throughout the Levant during the Early Neolithic, the association of subfloor burials with sunken plastered hearths seems to be an independent cultural norm estab- lished at CAin Ghazal. On the basis of projectile point styles, including Jericho, CAmuq, and Byblos types, the time depth at 'Ain Ghazal appears to span most of the 7th millennium (cf. Bar-Yosef 1981). The "white-ware" vessels indicate late 7th millennium and early 6th millennium dates (de Contenson and Courtois 1979). Although a large number of radiocarbon 12 BASOR 255</page><page sequence="11">'AIN GHAZAL: EARLY NEOLITHIC COMMUNITY samples was collected during the 1982 season, it has not yet been possible to arrange for C-14 analysis. The areal extent of CAin Ghazal is noteworthy, since Abu Hureyra in northern Syria is the only other site in the Levant of comparable size (Moore, Hillmann, and Legge 1975). Whether such large communities should be considered "villages" or "towns" is not resolvable on the basis of the pres- ent evidence, nor can reliable estimates of popula- tion size be made. If all of the residential clusters at 'Ain Ghazal were occupied simultaneously, it is probable that there was considerable social com- plexity, as is already suggested by human burials, the 15-m building, and possible recording systems. Larger-scale efforts are planned for several more seasons at 'Ain Ghazal. Expanded intensive inves- tigations at the site and in the immediate vicinity will greatly enhance our understanding of a cru- cial period of human cultural, social, and eco- nomic development, a period that established the foundations for the later emergence of "civilized" complex societies.4 NOTES 'The excavations were conducted while I was Annual Professor at the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman. I would like to express my appreciation to the appropriate committees and officers of ASOR and ACOR for making my residence period in Jordan possible. Dr. Adnan Hadidi, Director-General of the Depart- ment of Antiquities of Jordan, was instrumental in halt- ing further damage to the site. In addition, Dr. Hadidi arranged for the bulk of financial support, through the Department of Antiquities, for the dig season. His enthusiastic interest in the project is warmly acknowl- edged. I would also like to thank, for gracious financial support for the project, a donor from the United States who wishes to remain anonymous. Dr. David McCreely, Director of ACOR, kindly extended the ACOR facili- ties for processing and analysis and provided much encouragement during and after the season, for which I would like to thank him. Mrs. Crystal Bennett, Direc- tor of the British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History, supplied the project with essential field equipment, and her contributions and keen interest are heartily appreciated. The staff for the 1982 season was composed of the following: Co-Director in January: Dr. Albert Leonard, Jr.; Zooarchaeologist: Dr. Ilse Kohler; Human Osteol- ogist: Scott Rolston; Palaeoethnobotanist: Dr. David McCreery; Surveyor/Topographer: S.
