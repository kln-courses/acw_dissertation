<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution of Ganesa by Y. Krishan Hierarchically Ganesa is a relatively minor god of the Hindu pantheon. Essentially he is a parsva devat?, a subordinate deity. But in practical terms, he is one of the most important gods. He is both Vighnakartd 'creator of obstacles' and Vighnahartd 'remover of obstacles'. That is why he is Vighnesvara 'lord of obstacles'. He is invoked for averting evil and removing obstacles in any activity or performance, religious or secular and for success and prosperity. No work or enterprise can be started without offering him worship and invoking his blessings, be it the performance of domestic rites of birth, name giving, commencement of education, house warming, marriage, etc. All business activity, construction work, such as house building, launching of any new project, is preceded by the worship of Ganesa. For this reason the study of his origin is of great importance. Modern scholars are generally agreed that Ganesa is a non-Vedic god But how a non-Vedic and therianthropic god came to be admitted to the Hindu pantheon and its dualistic character received widespread acceptance, has not been adequately explained by the various scholarly studies of Ganesa (2). The peculiar and characteristic features of the classical Vin?yaka or Ganesa or Ganapati are five: i) Conceptually Vin?yaka is Vighnesvara 'lord of obstacles', vighnakartd 'creator of obstacles'; later he becomes vighnahartd 'remover of obstacles' and buddhid?t? 'bestower of knowledge', siddhid?t? 'bestower of success', and vrddhid?t? 'bestower of prosperity'; ii) Vin?yaka or Ganesa is generally associated with the m?trs or m?trk?s, usually seven in number; iii) physiognomically he has an elephant's head over a human trunk and limbs, that is, the head of an elephant with trunk, the lower portion being the body of a man; iv) Vin?yaka or Ganesa is also associated with the navagrahas, the nine planets of the Hindu astronomy.

Two other features of the classical Ganesa's, viz. that he is one-tusked {ekadantin) and has rat as his vdhana (mount), are not relevant in studying the evolution and functional significance of Ganesa and, therefore, have not been covered in this study as their examination, it was felt, will make this study discursive. It has been confined to the study of the core features of the cult of Ganesa. I. Ganesa as Vighnesa The Origin of Vighnakartd, 'Creator of Evil, of Impediments" and Evolution of Ganesa The Atharvaveda (3) traces the evil features of life ? disease, suffering and death ? to various factors: earthquakes, atmospheric disturbances, adverse astral movements, meteors (ulka), natural calamities (utpdta), naksatras (stars in the path of the moon) benign and malevolent, displeasure of divine beings and the mischief of evil spirits {A V 19.9.6-10). In particular the A V traces disease ? physical and mental of unknown etiology ? to certain supernatural factors ? demons or malevolent spirits ? pis?cas and atrins (who devour flesh of their victims), kanvas (who prey upon the embryos), epilepsy {apasm?ra) {AV 2.2.5, 4.37, 19.36.6), r?ksas (who deprive a person of the power of discrimination) {AV 6.111.2), gr?bt 'fit' or seizure (AV 2.9.1, 2.10.6, 3.11.1, 6.112.1, 8.2.12, 12.3.18), jambha 'convulsion' [AV 2.4.2). In fact, the AV calls the diseases themselves as demons. In particular Nirrti is the goddess of evil, of death; of evil omen 'of perdition and misfortune'. 'She is invoked and offerings are made to her to keep her away from the sacrifice and is prayed to remove any impediments or obstacles in the performance of a sacrifice' (4). In the epic period, she is replaced by Jyesth? Alaksmi, the antithesis of Laksmi, good fortune and wealth. Jyesth? Alaksmi is also called Hastimukh? and Vighnap?rasad? in the Baudh?yanagrhyas?tra. The Baudh?yanagrhya parisista III 10.1 f f. records a ritual text dedicated to the goddess Jyesth? Alaksmi who is called Hastimukh?. The evil spirits are exorcized by purification through water and by recitation of mantras, sacred hymns. In fact the AV (5) contains a number of c?tan?ni hymns which are used as 'expellers', that is, for exorcizing evil influences on beings, in witchcraft rites (abhic?rika). It is these evil spirits of the AV which come to be identified as Vighnakartd in subsequent literature. (3) See Encyclopaedia of Religion &amp; Ethics, Vol. IV, s.v. 'Disease &amp; Medicine. Vedic and Hindu'. (4) S.K. Lai, 'Female Divinities vis-a-vis Srauta Rites', The Haryana Sahitya Akademi Journal of Indological Studies, II 1-2, Spring 1987, p. 73. (5) W.D. Whitney, transl., Atharvaveda, Delhi 1962. Examples of C?tan?nihymns are AVI 1, II 14, II 18, II 25, V 29, etc. 294 [2]</page><page sequence="3">The earliest reference to Vighnakart? or evil producing being is to Vin?yaka in the M?navagrhyas?tra (7th-5th century B.C.). This s?tra speaks of four (6) Vin?yakas who are vighnas, impediments in the achievement of the goals of the people in various walks of life. They also take the form of mental disorders, obsessive and depressive states in their victims. In the Epics, Vin?yaka appears late inasmuch as the verses containing reference to Vin?yaka are interpolations. Again the essential nature of Vin?yaka is evil who needs to be appeased. Thus the R?m?yana (7) VI 128.113 speaks of pacification (samayanti) of Vin?yakas who haunt a house. In the S?ntiparva (8) of the Mbh, the interpolated reference, Vin?yaka is associated with demons and ghosts, r?ksasas, pis?cas and bh?tas and they are the source of vighnas, obstacles. An interpolated verse in the Anus?sanaparva (9) identifies Vin?yakas as the lord of ganas, and as the gods of the people in general. That the Vin?yaka in the epics had an evil nature is corroborated by the fact that in the epic mythology Rudra, who is the lord of the malevolent rudraganas, also becomes bh?t?dhipati and pramathan?tha (10). Kautilya in his Arthasastra (300 B.C. to 200 A.D.) enumerates 'evil spirits' under the name r?ksasa as one of the eight calamities {mah?bhay?ni). The Y?jnavalkyasmrti (lst-3rd century A.D.) marks the next stage in the evolution of Vighnakart? as Ganesa. In this smrti the four Vin?yakas of the M?navagrhyas?tra are amalgamated into one Vin?yaka who is an embodiment of evil. Whereas in the M?navagrhyas?tra Vin?yakas are impediments per se, in the Y?jnavalkyasmrti, the Vin?yaka becomes a single source of evil, of obstacles. Vin?yaka also acquires the capacity to render ineffective the performance of religious rites. He acquires a new designation ? gan?dhipati, later also called ganapati, mah? ganapati, the lord or leader of ganas, the word gana meaning a multitude, or hosts (n). Vin?yaka also becomes the son of Ambik? who, in the epic period, is deemed to be P?rvati, the spouse of Siva. Thus Vin?yaka comes to be associated with Siva as his son. Vin?yaka is also admitted into the Br?hmanical pantheon inasmuch as he (6) One of the four Vin?yakas is named in the M?navagrhyas?tra as K?sm?ndar?japutra. The other three Vin?yakas were: S?lakatahkata, Usmita and Devayajana. In Ayurveda K?sm?ndagraha is a psychic disease of the children involving personality disorder. See V.R. Athavale, B?laveda: Pediatrics and Ayurveda, Bombay 1977, p. 148. (7) Vin?yaksca samyanti grhatisthati yasya vai. See fn. 703 of the Yuddhak?nda of the Ram (er. ed.). This verse occurs in the Granth? edition. (8) Mbh (er. ed.), Vol. 16, Appendix I, No. 28, v. 420. (9) Mbh (er. ed.), Vol. 17, Pt. II, Appendix I, No. 18, v. 55. (10) Pramathan?tha is the title of Siva who is another variant of Rudra. (n) The word gana in the smrtis only means (i) an association of merchants, (ii) a guild of horse traders, (iii) an association of men living in a village, (iv) an association of warriors, etc. who pursue the same vocation. See S.C. Banerji, A Glossary of Smrti Literature, Calcutta 1963. [3] 295</page><page sequence="4">is appointed as the leader of ganas (ganapati) by Brahma and Rudra (12) and recitation of Vedic svasti and ball mantras is prescribed for the performance of Vin?yaka s?nti pacificatory rites. Conclusive evidence of the brahmanization of Vin?yaka is to be found in the fact that the Vin?yakas of the M?navagrhyas?tra are offered wine and flesh whereas the later Vin?yaka-Ganesa is vegetarian enjoying modaka (sweet balls) (13). Further, worship of Vin?yaka alongwith grahas ensures that all actions bear fruit (Yaj I 293). Thus Vin?yaka now also becomes siddhid?t?, bestower of fortune. V?yupur?na (300-600 A.D.) I 30.309 emphasizes that the house in which Siva is worshipped is free, inter alia, from malevolent Vin?yakas: na ca yaksah pis?c? v? na n?ga na Vin?yak?h kuryurvighnam grhe tasya yatna sanst?yate bhavah. The V?yupur?na II 30 narrates how Ganesa as Nikumbha or Ksemaka was commissioned by Siva to deceive the pious king Divod?sa of V?r?nasi; he granted boons to everyone else but withheld them from Divod?sa and his queen mischievously and provoked him into destroying Ganesa's shrine in anger on the ground that this Ganesa was wicked (dur?tma) (V?yu II 30.50). This provides corroborative evidence that in the first phase of his evolution Ganesa or Vin?yaka was only an evil being, vighnakart?. In the Brahm?ndapur?na 2.3.7.161 Vin?yaka is loka vin?yaka ? a folk evil spirit. In the Bh?gavatapur?na 1.1.39 (6th century A.D.) Vin?yaka is described as vighnar?ja (lord of obstacles), gan?dhipa (lord of ganas). Though in Bh?gavata XII 27.20-23 Vin?yakas become companions of the god Bh?gavata, their evil nature is clearly established by their association with r?ksasas, pisacas, bh?tas, pretas [Bh?gavata II 10.35-40; VI 8.19-24; X 6.19-29) with K?sam?nda grahas (VI 8.19-24 and X 6.19-29), with D?kinis, Jat?dh?rin M?trs (X 6.19-29). The Baudh?yanadharmas?tra (BaudhDS) 2.5.9.7 is a rite of tarpana, offering of water and food to refresh or satiate Vighna (obstacles), Vin?yaka (leader of obstacles), Ganapati (lord of ganas). Likewise BaudhDS 3.6.13 advises that a person undergoing pr?yascitta (expiation) should have darsana (reverential view) of ganas and of the lord of ganas [gan?n?ma pasyati gan?dhipatim pasyati) (14). B?nabhatta (7th century A.D.) in Harsacarita III calls Vin?yaka as Vighna Vin?yaka, emphasizing his evil or obstacle producing nature: in Harsacarita VIII he calls Vin?yaka as asiva sahacara ? an (12) In the Var?hapur?na 23.25 Brahma tells Rudra that Ganapati, who was born from his laughter (that is from his mouth) be the chief of the Vin?yakas. (13) As has been stated by V. Ramasubramaniam, 'The Ganapati-Vin?yaka-Gaj?nana Worship. Analysis of an Integrated Cult', Bulletin of the Institute of Traditional Cultures, Madras, 1971, p. 138: '[...] the demoniac Vin?yakas and Vighnesas, who were delighting in fish, meat, and wine, being elevated to the caste of the vegetarian, modaka-\ov'm% "twice born (dvija) Br?lirnin''', now the offering is of coconut. (14) B?hler has pointed out that 'several adhy?yas of Prsna III seem to have been borrowed from other works or to be abstracts from them [...] the sixth [chapter] bears a very close and suspicious resemblance to Visnu XLVIII. In fact, according to Jolly, the passage in Baudh?yana "which inculcates the worship of Ganesa or Siva or both would be quite sufficient in itself to cast a doubt on the genuineness and originality of his versions'" (G. B?hler, transl., The Sacred Laws of the ?ryas (SBE), Delhi 1965, Introduction, p. xxxiv; J. Jolly, transl., Institutes of Visnu (SBE, VII), Delhi 1965, Introduction, p. xix. 296 [4]</page><page sequence="5">inauspicious, or more precisely an evil companion. Likewise, in the XJttarabh?ga of K?dambart, Bh?sana refers to asiva m?rtyo mah?vin?yaka, Vin?yaka as the embodiment of inauspiciousness or evil. Mit?ksar? {Mit), 10th century commentary on Y?jnavalkyasmrti I 271 calls Vin?yaka lord of evils or impediments, Vighnesvara. He is also appointed as such by Visnu, besides Rudra and Brahm?. As he is now an appointee of all the three great gods of Hinduism, Brahm?, Siva (Rudra) and Visnu, he ceases to be a sectarian god; he becomes non-sectarian. Perhaps that is why Mit I 292 says that Vin?yaka should be substituted by the word Bhagav?na, Lord of Destiny. The Bhavisyapur?na 1.23 {vighnakarnainiryukto api vin?yakah) and the Devipur?na 61 {vin?yakah karmavighna siddhyartham viniyojitah) declare that Vin?yaka was appointed to create obstacles in all works or enterprises. The Nepalese Buddhist legend in the Svayambhupur?na (15) provides independent corroborative evidence that, in its original nature, Ganesa was a vighna, an obstacle, hence evil. He was admitted into the Buddhist pantheon on being chastened by Vighn?ntaka. Odiy?c?rya was harassed by Ganesa for his failure to invite him to a function where other gods had been invited to instal his idol in a temple; Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha created Vighn?ntaka to protect Odiy?c?rya. Eventually, Ganesa surrendered to Vighn?ntaka but on the condition that he (Ganesa) should be worshipped at the commencement of all works or ceremonies. Skanda, Another Vighnakart? Besides Vin?yaka, Skanda was also originally said to cause disease, suffering and thus create obstacles. In fact, Skanda was once the embodiment of evil par excellence (16). In the 'original' Mah?bh?rata as reconstituted, it is Skanda who is considered as Vighnakart? 'creator of obstacles'. The ?ranyaparva of the Mbh 3.215 describes the birth of Skanda, Kum?ra, Guha, from the intercourse of Fire with Sv?h?, daughter of Daksa. Sv?h? deposits the seed (semen of Agni) on a peak of white mountain guarded by poisonous snakes, and abounding in r?ksasas, pis?cas and other terrible spirits and animals. In other words the environment in which Skanda was born only generated (15) A. Mitra, op. cit., pp. 41-42. (16) F.W. Hopkins, Epic Mythology, New Delhi 1974 (repr.), p. 229, states that 'as son of Agni, Skanda was identified with all burnings (fevers) and other afflictions. The god who represented fire and affliction was naturally associated with the troops of afflicting beings grouped about Siva and so became a "son of Siva" '. Edgerton, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary, observes that Skandha is the name of an evil being, a demon that causes drought. Again Skandha often occurs as a wrong reading of Skanda. It is the name of evil powers. Edgerton adds: Tt is possible but far from certain that this is to be identified with the Skt Skanda who is said to cause diseases among children'. [51 297</page><page sequence="6">and strengthened his evil disposition. The birth of Skanda was accompanied by terrifying portents (mah?ghor?n utp?t?n: Mbh 3.215.1) and the sages perform pacificatory rites (s?nti). Initially the birth of Skanda is described as a great calamity (anartha mah?n: Mbh 3.215.2-3). He was nursed by dohit?yanivAio as a blood-sucker and an embodiment of krodha (karodhasamudabhava) 'anger' and of kr?ra 'cruel', a being who lived on blood (kr?ra lohitabhojana: Mbh 3.226-27). Skanda is said to rob children, both newly born and in womb (Mbh 3.217.1). Seven mothers, K?ki, Halim?, M?lini, Brmh?t?, Ary?, Pal?lk?, and Vaimitr?, are made the mothers of the world and are both propitious (siva) and unpropitious (asiva) (Mbh 3.217.8). Skanda confers on mothers the capacity to devour children (m?trn?m praj? bhoktum: Mbh 3.219.19). In addition, eighteen grahas emerge from Skanda who are fond of flesh and liquor and who afflict young children till they attain the age of 16 (Mbh 3.219.19), who devour the offsprings of mortals and destroy the foetuses (Mbh 3.219.25-40). This band of seven mothers (m?taras) and the male grahas are called Skanda-grahas (Mbh 3.219.42). If Skanda and Skanda-grahas and the M?taras are properly propitiated, they bestow well being, long life and virility. The grahas which afflict after the age of 16 cause madness in their victims: these grahas are devagraha, pitrgraha, siddhagraha, r?ksasagraha, yaksagraha, pis'?cagraha, gandharvagraha (Mbh 3.219.44-52). It is also significant that the various companions of Skanda, viz. M?trs and grahas are called ganas whose worship helps to obtain wealth and avert diseases (Mbh 3.220.12). TheBrahm?ndapur?na 2-3.10.51-53 says that Skanda was surrounded by pramathas, m?trs and vin?yakas, and this is indicative of the close connection between them. That the true original nature of Skanda was evil is also borne out by the beings who attended his coronation (abhiseka) when he becomes Commander-in-Chief (mah?sen?pati) of the forces of the devas (devasen?pati) in their fight against the asuras; yaksas and r?ksasas join the investiture ceremony (Mbh 9.44.22); Yama provides Skanda with two attendants Unmatha and Pramatha (Mbh 9.44.27). Some of the companions of Skanda had faces of animals, tortoise, cock, dog, wolf, owl, ass, etc.; some had hideous features, large necks, nose, teeth, etc.; some had their mouths on their stomachs, on their backs, etc., later identified as classical ganas. M?trs also became his companions. In the Mrcchakatik? 3.12 thieves are said to be the disciples of Skanda, caur?n?m Skandaputr?n?m. In the Susruta samhit? VI 27.3-5 nine diseases (grahas) of children are enumerated. Of these the first two are the Skandagraha and Skand?pasm?ra. Another disease afflicting children is called Naigamesa of B?lagraha. The ram-headed Naigamesa is also related to Skanda because he was produced from Siva. In this Samhit? Skanda is called grah?dhipati, lord of planets. The Ast?ngahrdaya VI 3.1-2 (17) also describes Skanda as a spirit causing diseases among children. The K?syapasamhit? V 11.21, inter-alia, speaks of Skandagraha. (17) It classifies five grahas as male (Skanda, Vis?kha, Mesa, Sva, Pitr) and seven as female grahas: (Sakuni, P?tan?, Sitap?tan?, Adrsti-p?tan?, Mukhamanditik?, Revati and Suska Revati). 298 [6]</page><page sequence="7">In Somadeva's Kath?sarits?gara VIII.7.181-183 Skanda is said to be surrounded by dusta graha sisugraha, inauspicious planets and planets unfavourable to children. Supplement No. 20 to the Atharvaveda parisista is an apocryphal and late text named Dh?rta Kalpa (18) which contains details about the worship of Skanda: the ritual of Skanda is called Dh?rtay?ga ? worship paid to Dh?rta ? rogue in case of illness. The other names of Dh?rta are Skanda, Vis?kha, S?lakatankata. S?lakatankata is one of the four Vin?yakas in the M?navagrhyas?tra. He is accompanied by m?trk?s. It appears that the Atharvaveda Parisista preserves the memory of the evil-causing being of a much earlier period. It also appears that in the Buddhist literature also Skanda was considered an evil being. Thus, in the Mbh Skanda is the embodiment of evil forces which torment man with death and disease, physical and mental, and thus plays the same role as the Vin?yaka of the M?navagrhyas?tra and of the Y?jnavalkyasmrti. But Skanda is also appointed to the office of Devasen?pati, the Commander of the forces of the gods in their fight against demons. Skanda becomes a Vedic, more precisely, an epic deity and is accepted by Indra as the leader of the army of gods and the husband of Devasen? (19). There is now an apparent conflict between the role of Skanda as vighnakart? and as the leader of the divine hosts. No wonder Skanda could no longer continue to be the source of evil; the office of Devasen?pati made it imperative for Skanda to let his evil-causative traits wither away (20) and to let Vin?yaka retain that exclusive privilege to himself, and he became Vighna v?rana, 'Warderer' of obstacles (Sivapur?na 2 IV 6.18-19) (21). It is significant that in the Ganesapur?na (22) May?resvara, the second incarnation of Ganesa, transfers his v?hana, may?ra 'peacock', to Sad?nana or Skanda. In short, Skanda undergoes a transformation: he ceases to be a pis?ca and becomes a god. His functions as pis?ca are appropriated by Vin?yaka or Ganesa. Now Ganesa becomes the great gr?madevat? mah?gr?mani of Bharatamuni's N?tyas?stra 3.9 who is identified by Abhinavagupta with Mah?ganapati. It follows from the above that the classical Ganesa as Vighnakart?, creator of obstacles, had not emerged in the Hindu pantheon of the Mah?bh?rata and the god of evil had not acquired a definitive name: he was called Vin?yaka {M?navagrhyas?tra) and Skanda {Mbh), and r?ksasa in the Arthas?stra of Kautilya. It is only in the (18) V.S. Agrawala, Ancient Indian Folk Cults, Varanasi 1970, p. 69. See also P.K. Agrawala, Skanda-K?rttikeya, Varanasi 1967, pp. 18-20 and Appendix II, pp. 104-10. (19) Agrawala, ibid., p. 71. As Agrawala puts it, ibid., p. 72, '[...] a fold deity of terrible form with bloody red eyes and projecting fangs like those of Yaksas and Cannibal goblins (pisacas) was being converted into a beautiful high born deity having a lofty rank'. (20) Kaly?na: Ganesa Anka (Hindi), Gorakhpur 1974, p. 319. (21) In Manj?srtm?lakalpa, ed. T. Ganapati Sastri, Trivandrum 1920, chap. II, p. 29, Manjusri is described as a mah?krodhar?ja having the name Sanamukha 'six-faced', paramaguhya 'most mysterious' and vighnavin?sakah 'destroyer of impediments'. (22) Kaly?na, cit., p. 319. [7] 299</page><page sequence="8">Y?jnavalkyasmrti that Vin?yaka becomes a single entity causing evil; he also becomes the principal source of obstacles, as distinguished from Skanda who now undergoes a beneficial tranformation. As a natural consequence, the practice of ritual s?nti or pacificatory rite, is no longer limited to the appeasement of Vedic gods. This is now extended to include the appeasement of Vin?yaka. IL Vin?yaka and the Saptam?trk?s The m?trs do not figure in the grhyas?tras (23). The m?trs were originally non Vedic (24), non-Aryan, Dravidian folk deities, gr?madevat?s. This is borne out by the names of the m?trs in Mbh 3.224.10-16, 225.22-25, 229.14-15, which mention seven sisu m?trk?s-. K?ki, Halim?, M?lini, Brmh?t?, Ary?, Pal?l?, and Vaimitr?. In fact Mbh 3.217.7-13 classifies the m?trs into two broad groups: siv?h (propitious) and asiv?h (evil). The latter cause abortion, afflict children, feast on children's flesh and cause abnormalities in the birth of children {Mbh 3.219.27.36): they are malign for children upto the age of sixteen {Mbh 3.219.41). They also personified various scourges which afflict mankind: small-pox (M?t?, Sital?, Jyesth? Poleram?), typhoid (Mutteyalamm?), cholera (Ankamm?), jaundice, hysteria, or deadly serpents (Manas?), and cattle diseases. In the Salyaparva of the Mah?bh?rata {25) about 185 m?trs are named and it is added that there are many other Mothers numbering thousands and of diverse forms. They were conceived as fierce, hideous, ravenous, emaciated, baleful or malefic beings; in short they were similar to witches and were to be propitiated by bloody sacrifices of goats, pigs, hens, buffaloes, etc. In fact, the Aranyaparva of the Mbh 3.217.8-9 distinguishes the female followers of Skanda as s'iv?, auspicious benign spirits, and asiv?, inauspicious evil spirits (26). The asiv? are the evil-causing m?trk?s. The character of the m?trs referred to in the Kath?sarits?gara can be appreciated from their (23) P.V. Kane, History, of the Dharmasastras, Vol. II, Pt. 1, Poona 1974, pp. 217-18. (24) R.N. Dandekar, Insights into Hinduism, Delhi 1979, p. 133, observes: '[...] in the hieratic Vedic religion, not much importance is attached to female divinities: Aditi can hardly be equated with Mother goddess; Us?s, Prthivi are little more than naturalistic. [...] the other female divinities in the Veda are either mere colourless female counterparts or wives of male gods, or otherwise they represent the later deification of some abstract concepts'. Dandekar goes on to suggest that Nirrti, Siniv?li, Kuh? and Gung? are presumably the Vedic reflections of some such female divinities'. (25) Mbh 9.45.3-29. (26) That these m?trs were originally of evil disposition receives confirmation from the fact that the daughters of Hut?san?, a m?tr, request Skanda to bless them to become 'the best mothers of the world' (sarva lokasya... m?tara uttam?h, Mbh 3.217.7). Skandapur?na 7.2.29.174-75 speaks of sisum?tarah, who lift away new-born children. Their names are similar to those found in Mbh 3.22.10-16, viz. K?ki, Hilim?, Rudr?, Vrsabh?, ?y?, Pal?l?, and Mitr?. These are later-day d?kinis and yoginis. 300 [8]</page><page sequence="9">association with yaksas (Kath? 17(AAA)), bh?tas (spirits of the dead) and yoginis (witches). Thus these m?trs were essentially negative divinities (27). The Harivamsapur?na II 109.54 &amp; 60-62 speaks of male and female grahas and m?taras with animal and bird heads including elephant (hasti)-faced. Again in the Harivamsa Ganesvara (28) is the name of a demon causing diseases and is to be depicted in the company of m?trs. Likewise the V?yupur?na II 39.259-62 speaks of various animal-headed female ganas including gajavaktr? and gaj?nan?. The Skandapur?na 6.81.17 refers to gajasy? (elephantine), 6.85.3&amp;9 to Gajavaktr? (29), and 6.87.23 to Gajamukhi. There is archaeological evidence that disease- and evil-causing m?trk?s were represented as having animal and bird faces. The following elephant-faced figures of m?trk?s before the emergence of the classical Ganesa or Vin?yaka in the 6th century A.D. suggest that it is Jyesth? Alaksmi, as hastimukh?, which is the prototype of the classical Gaj?nan? Vighnakart?. 1.

In its present damaged state, it is not possible to determine whether these elephant heads (30) are the heads of male or female elephants and whether the trunk was human, male of female. There is, however, no doubt that the relief, including the elephant heads, was decorative, and not votive or dedicatory. 3. A panel from Mathur? of the 2nd century A.D. depicting M?trk?s. One of the m?trk?s is elephant-headed. 4. A fragmentary S?tav?hana sculpture of the 2nd century A.D. from Amar?vati, depicting a garland-bearing dwarf couple with the heads and ears of an elephant but without its distinctive trunk. This couple, in our opinion, depicts Kumbhi (31) which is another name of Jyesth? Alaksmi in the Baudh?yanagrhyas?tra. (27) The phrase 'negative' is of Dandekar. He observes, They [the m?trk?s] are regarded specifically as negative divinities in the sense that they are prayed to not so much that they may bestow any positive good on the worshipper as that they may forestall the evils which are likely to befall them' (op. cit., p. 132). In our opinion, however, they are essentially evil-causing beings and not merely those which avert evil. See also R.N. Dandekar, 'God in Hindu Thought', Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1968, p. 454. (28) M. Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, s.v. (29) S.A. Dange, Paur?nic Myth and Culture, Delhi 1987, p. 25, observes: 'The combination of the beast and human in one body is often the characteristic of demons and spirits'. (30) There is no authority for describing these elephant heads as elephant Yaksas as done by A.K. Coomaraswamy, Yaksas, Pt. I, Washington 1928, p. 23. (31) According to Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Kumbha means a jar, pitcher. It also means 'The frontal lobe or prominence on the upper part of an elephant' and Kumbhin means ' "having on his forehead the prominence called kumbha", an elephant'. [9] 301</page><page sequence="10">5. A m?trk? of the Gupta period, 4th century A.D., from Mathur?, which is usually called 'Vain?yaki' (32). These m?trk?s, including Gajaslrs? or elephant-headed female figures are gr?ma devat?s or folk deities. In the Skandapur?na VI 81.12-17 a Br?hmana father curses LaksmI to become elephant-faced (gaj?sy? bhav?) in retaliation to the curse pronounced by her on his daughter asvamukht bhava (be horse-faced) as LaksmI was angry at her spouse Visnu becoming infatuated with the feminine beauty of that marriageable girl. The elephant-faced m?trk?s are to be identified with Jyesth? Alaksmi, Gajamu kh?, as distinguished from the later-day Vain?yaki, Gaj?nan? of the classical Brahmanical pantheon, and the Vain?yaki of the Caunsatha Yogini temples at Rampur Jharial in Bolangir, Orissa, Hirapur near Bhubanesvara, Orissa and Bheraghat, Jubbalpore, M.P. The m?trk?s of the Kushan and Gupta periods are quite different from the later m?trk?s of the Brahmanical pantheon. They are human-faced, animal-faced and bird faced (33). They are emaciated, misshapen, and hungry-looking, embodiment of evil as compared to the generally charming and benign Brahmanical m?trk?s who generally have saumya, placid, gentle, mild appearance. Their number varies from two, three to seven. However, two panels from the early Kushan period (34) show sapta m?trk?s as human females in ordinary dress without any weapons or symbols and without any v?hanas. In fact they all seem to be identical or indistinguishable from one another. It would appear that the Pur?nic texts cited subsequently enjoin the classical form of the seven or eight m?trs and the Mathur? sculptures of human-faced m?trk?s mark an earlier stage in the evolution of m?trk? iconography, especially the transition from animal- and bird-faced m?trk?s, lokam?t?s to human m?trk?s, devam?t?s, as saktis of different Brahmanical gods (35). In the Pur?nic period we have the development of benign m?trk?s, devam?t?s. To distinguish them from laukika or gr?madevat? m?trk?s, lokam?t?s, they may appropriately be described as Brahmanical or alaukika m?trk?s. They are spouses of Brahmanical gods, saktis or divine female energies of Vedic or Brahmanical gods. Generally these were seven in number but sometimes eight are also named. Their names clearly indicate their affiliation and role: Br?hmi or Br?hmani (sakti of Brahm?), M?hesvari (sakti of Mahesvara or Siva), Kaum?ri (sakti of Kum?ra or Skanda) Vaisnavi (sakti of Visnu), V?r?hi (sakti of Var?ha), Indr?ni, or Aindri or (32) In our opinion, it is more appropriate to describe it as a statue of a m?trk? as the concept of classical Vin?yaka and consequently of Vain?yaki had not emerged by this period.

(35) Tiwari, ibid., p. 105 says that the m?trs from Mathur? exhibit an 'emergent iconography which had not yet been standardised'. 302 [10]</page><page sequence="11">M?hendri {sakti of Indra), C?mund?, {sakti of Yama) (36). C?mund? is a fierce, cruel goddess, essentially similar to the kr?ra m?trk?s. It appears that C?mund? (37) in the Brahmanical saptam?trk?s represents the entire group of the terrible m?trk?s (38). The origin of the Brahmanical m?trk?s lies in the fact that the divine Brahmanical mothers are the embodiment of the cosmic creative power whereas their male spouses or counterparts are the supreme transcendental spirit which remains eternally in a state of bliss and inactivity. In other words the divine Brahmanical or deva-m?trs come to represent the creative-dynamic aspect of the ultimate reality, the supreme spirit which is conceived to be essentially inactive, passive. (36) See Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary. He cites a variant list in which Raudri Carmamund? and Kala Samkarsini are mentioned. Another list of 16 m?trs gives their names as Gauri, Padm?, Saci, Midh?, S?vitri, Vijay?, Gay?, Devasen?, Svadh?, Sv?h?, S?nti, Pusti, Dhrtti, Tusti, Atma devat?, and Kuladevat?. Amarakosa 1.1.35-37 enumerates seventeen m?tar?h or Mother Goddesses. (37) N.P. Joshi, M?trk?s, Mothers in Kus?na Art, New Delhi 1986, p. 35. He adds that in the Gupta period we have new m?trk?s, Aindri, Kaum?ri, V?r?hi but not the Kushan m?trk?s. 'This lacuna was bridged by introducing C?mund?, who headed all the ferocious and cruel m?trk?s, and whose worship, according to the Agni Pur?na, warded off all the evils caused by those m?trk?s* (ibid., p. 82). According to the Skandapur?na V 3.14.53-61, 58.7-88, C?mund? headed all the M?trganas and Vin?yakaganas who caused havoc. According to the Padmapur?na 31.61.141, the ferociuos group of m?trs had their origin in C?mund? or Sivaduti. (38) Tiwari, op. cit., p. 94, observes that the concept of the Supreme Goddess arose in the Gupta period. 'As a direct result of the evolution of the Supreme Goddess, the idea became popular that each God has his sakti. The gods in themselves are powerless and their energies are centred in their female counterparts'. Thus the cult of the m?trs as saktis of various gods is a phenomenon of the Gupta or post-Gupta period. Correlating the sculptural and literary data, Joshi, op. cit., observes that 'the Kus?na m?trk?s came to be substituted by the Sapta-m?trk?s in early Gupta age', (p. x) and 'the concept of Sapta-m?trk?s is post-Kus?na in date' (p. 39), 'the m?trk?s of the Kus?na period [...] have gradually been replaced by the Sapta-m?trk?s of the classical age' (p. 89). He adds (p. 81): 'With the end of the Kus?na rule sculptural representation of the m?trk?s undergoes significant change. The "mother and child" type with human, bird or animal faces gradually disappeared and was replaced by panels showing the seven Divine Mothers namely Br?hmi, M?hesvari, Vaisnavi, etc.'. H. Krishna Sastri, South Indian Images of Gods and Goddesses, Madras 1916, pp. 190, 224-26, 229 classifies the m?trk?s in two groups (a) Saivite and (b) gr?madevat? or village deities. The Saivite group of sakti deities are usually seven in number and called Saptam?trk?s: Br?hmi, M?hesvari, Vaisnavi, Kaum?ri, V?r?hi, M?hendri and C?mund?. With the addition of Mah?laksmi they become a group of eight mothers, (b) The shrines of gr?madevat?s are generally the haunts of malevolent demons who are appeased by the slaughter of fowls, sheep, goats and buffaloes. Their popular names are Kanniyam?r, who are seven in number (seven sisters), Bhadrak?li, K?liyamm?, Mariyamm?, etc. Mariyamm?, Kolumamm?, Silliyamm?, Poleramm? are goddesses of smallpox and infections and correspond to Sital?. The Kanniyam?r are to be appeased for any unforeseen and sudden illness. Their worship is performed generally by non-Br?hmanas. Var?hamihira in Brhatsamhit? 57-56 is quite specific: 'the Mothers should be made with the forms and the cognisance of the individual God whom they are named after'. The Matsyapur?na 261.24 lays down that the distinguishing features of the m?trs should be the same as of their respective lord: m?trin?m laksanam vaksye yath?vadanup?rvasah. The M?rkandeyapur?na [11] 303</page><page sequence="12">The Sivapur?na I.15.49-64 &amp; 16-1-12 embodies this idea in a myth in which Brahma creates five mental sons for undertaking the task of creation. But they fail as they were averse to worldly attachment. Eventually, Brahma, by seeing the ardhan?risvara form of Siva realized that the female was essential if the work of creation was to be undertaken. Another noteworthy factor in the growth of the cult of Brahmanical m?trs was that these divine mothers performed the task of subduing or destroying the demons. According to the Matsyapur?na 179 (39), the M?taras or M?trk?s were created by Mah?deva to fight the Andhakas created from the spilled blood of Andhaka after he was wounded by Rudra with his P?supata. These Mothers drank up the blood of Andhakas ? they were of horrible appearance. The Matsyapur?na enumerates their names: M?hesvari, Br?hmi, Kaum?ri, M?lini and hundreds more. Likewise, in the Devtmah?tmya Section of the M?rkandeyapur?na the Energies (saktayah) emerge from the bodies of various Brahmanical gods like Brahma, Siva, Visnu, etc. to fight (40). Thus, in the case of the Brahmanical m?trs, their names and numbers are varying 7, 9, 16, over a hundred (Matsyapur?na). They are saktis of Brahmanical gods. The Matsyapur?na 179.82-83 contains direct evidence regarding tranformation in the nature of M?trs from terrible beings, ghouls, to benign goddesses. It is stated in Matsya 179 that the m?trs created by Siva to fight Andhakas were of terrible looks and blood-thirsty. They were subdued by the m?trs created by Visnu. Devtmah?tmya 88.11-13 also states that the m?trk?s as saktis of various gods assume the same form tadr?paih, ornaments and have the same v?hana as the corresponding devat?s; ibid., 88.14-20 the various m?trs emerge from different Brahmanical gods like Brahma, Siva, Visnu, etc. In other words, the alaukika or Brahmanical m?trs are to be made in the image of the Brahmanical gods. David Kinsley in his Hindu Goddesses, University of California Press, 1986, pp. 151-60 gives a brief but self-contained account of the cult of the m?trk?s. His conclusions are summarized below: The early references to the m?trk?s go back to about the 1st century A.D. Their number is not specified and they are thought to belong to and act as a group. They are of inauspicious nature, of violent temperament, cause diseases especially among children to whom they are particularly inimical. They appear to be non-Aryan, more probably non-Brahmanical village goddesses. They speak a variety of languages, are of dark complexion and live in mountains and caves. In the mediaeval period they undergo a process of Brahmanization and domestication. They come to be regarded as energies of male Hindu gods, take on their names and characteristics and are generally seven in number and come to play a protective and benign role. (39) C. Dimmit &amp; J.A.B, van Buitenen, Classical Hindu Mythology, New York 1978, pp. 324-45, 364. The Var?hapur?na 17.43 describes the m?tn as a group of passions (in man's body) and ibid. 27.35.37 identifies them with eight evil mental qualities such as Yogesvari as k?ma 'desire', M?hesvari as krodha 'anger', Vaisnavi as lobha 'greed', Br?hmani as mada 'pride', Kaum?ri as moha 'attachment', Indr?ni as m?tsarya 'fault finding', and V?r?hi as as?ya 'envy'. It appears that the Var?hapur?na perhaps represents an intermediate stage in the transformation of the m?trs from evil, external spirits affecting human beings to personified divine energies who promote good and destroy evil. (40) The V?manapur?na 30.3-9, however, states that the m?trs come from the various parts of the body of the Goddess (Candi) herself. 304 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Visnu directs the m?trs 'you should also foster and guide the universe with my command as men and animals look after their offsprings and as the devas protect the creation, so do ye also and work in everyway like the devas' (41). In other words the m?trs undergo a transformation (42). Now the m?trs are of benign nature, creative and possessing generally pleasing appearances, the exceptions being Kali and C?mund?. They assumed fierce and hideous forms such as C?mund? (43) to destroy demons. A few represented the cosmic process of decay, K?? representing Time as destroyer of all things, widespread destruction (samh?ra) in the form of Bhairavi, representing Bhairava, destruction. In other words, the Brahmanical m?trs did not cause evil as such as the non-Brahmanical laukika or gr?madevat? m?trs (44), apart from the inherent cosmic decay and destruction. That there were two classes of m?trk?s would be clear from the Skandapur?na which draws a clear distinction between them: preta m?trk?s or bh?tam?trk?s who abide with the bh?taganas {bh?tam?t?sarvabh?ta-ganairvrta) and are to be seen in villages and towns [Skanda VII 1.167.1-3 and 119: bh?tam?teti samtdrst? gr?me gr?me pure pure), and the devam?taras {Skanda VII 1.185.1-6). But the Brahmanical or alaukika m?trs are rather a late development in the Hindu pantheon. In the Bihar Stone pillar inscription of Skandagupta (45), only the name Bhadr? the Mother Goddess, is decipherable and that the Mother goddesses were the followers of Skanda. The Gandhar inscription of A.D. 423-24 of Visvavarman of the time of Kum?ragupta I (46), speaks of the creation of 'the terrible abode [vis?matyugram) of the M?trs in which D?kinis (female ghouls) who stir up oceans with the mighty wind rising from the magic rites of their religion'. The Deogarh Rock inscription of Sv?mibhata dated to the end of the 6th century A.D. (47) records, above a niche, the construction of an abode for a panel of seven (41) H.H. Wilson, transl., The Matsyapur?na, repr., Delhi 1979, Vol. II. (42) Tiwari, op. cit., p. 119, observes that the m?trs in the Mah?bh?rata 'were a group of popular divinities influential but yet outside the pale of brahmanical society [...]'. Further, ibid., p. 110, 'The traditional origin of the M?trs as reflected in the Pur?nic myths outlined above [Devimah?tmya of M?rkandeyapur?na, V?manapur?na and Var?hapur?na] is clearly an attempt to incorporate the deities (M?trs) into the brahmanical pantheon'. (43) Krishna Sastri, op. cit., p. 229, states that the Saptam?trk?s of the Tantras are also counted among village deities. (44) South Indian icons of C?mund? are benign in expression and portray the deity with a well proportioned body: K.K. Dasgupta.

The inscriptions of early K?dambas (48) speak of m?trganas; but their numbers are not specified. In the inscriptions of the C?lukya Kings (49), the number of Mothers is given as seven (H?riti-putr?n?m sapta-M?trbhiabhivardhit?n?m) but the names of the mothers are not given. Var?hamihira is also silent about the number and names of Mother goddesses: the Brhatsamhit? (58.56) (50) only enjoins that the cognizances of the Mothers are the same as those of the gods with corresponding names. The p?wabh?ga 48 of K?dambart refers to m?trmandala but the number and names of m?trs is not specified. The Kath?sarits?gara (51) refers to an unspecified group of M?trs, m?tr-cakra, m?tr-mandala, m?tr-gana; once it names N?r?yani as their leader. It is only Utpala (9th century A.D.) (52) in his commentary (57.56) who cites the names of eight M?trs: Br?hmi, Vaisnavi, Raudri, Kaum?ri, Aindri, Yami, V?runi and Kauberi. Later in the same comments he adds that there are other M?trs like Narasirhhi, V?r?hi and Vain?yaki. It would be evident from the above that the cult of the Brahmanical m?trs is a o late, perhaps post-Gupta development. Individual Brahmanical m?trs were conceived earlier but they had hardly any significant role to play. The early-group m?trs are generally more or less identical without any significant difference to distinguish one from the other (53). In the post-Gupta early medieval period the concept of Brahmanical m?trs appears to have been an attempt at brahmanization of the concept of m?trs. It is the gr?madevat? or laukika m?trs, non-Aryan, non-Vedic, indigenous mother goddesses, which are important in the pre-Gupta period. These m?trs or m?trk?s are essentially asiv?, malefic in nature. They cause evil and suffering to their victims and hence were sought to be propitiated for averting their baleful influence. When the term m?trs came to be appropriated to Brahmanical or alaukika m?trs, it appears that the gr?madevat? or laukika m?trs came to be described in the Gandhar inscription as d?kinis, ghouls, a term which truly reflects their nature. It would also be clear from the above that the pre-Gupta m?trs {d?kinis) were first associated with Skanda in his pre-Devasen?pati phase and thereafter with Vin?yaka (48) Fleet, CII, Vol. Ill, p. 48.

In literature and art, Ganesa or Vin?yaka is found associated closely with the Saptam?trk?s. According to Y?jn?v?lkya 290 (54) Vin?yaka is the son of Ambik? to whom the worshipper of Vin?yaka should offer obeisance. The Gobhilasmrti prescribes that at the beginning of all rites m?trs together with Ganesa have to be worshipped. The K?tay?yamsmrti (56) also associates Ganesa with m?trs. The Apar?jitaprcch? (57) prescribes that the m?trk?s should be placed in between Ganan?tha (Ganesa) and Bhairava. The Padmapur?na 1.66 (58) in an invocation to Ganapati refers to his being surrounded by Mothers {m?trk? parivestitam). According to the tantras (59), Ganesa, navagrahas and m?trk?s are worshipped at the commencement of all auspicious functions or rites. In iconography, the saptam?trk?s are usually, though not invariably, shown with Virabhadra at one end and Ganesa at the other. The Mayamata (6th to 10th century) and the R?pamandana (15th century) (60) lay down that Virabhadra should be depicted before the Mothers and Ganesa at the end. Temple decorations (61) provide extensive evidence in support of this prescription in the silpasastras. III. Physiognomic Characteristics of Ganesa: an Elephant's Head and Trunk with a Human Torso Vin?yaka is also called Vakratunda, that is, having a twisted trunk and also called Danti, possessing tusks. Y?jnavalkyasmrti states that Vin?yaka has the features of an elephant's head ? vakratunda and danti. In the Baudh?yanadharmas?tra 2.5.9.7, tarpana rite is performed in honour of Ganapati who is also described, inter alia, as hastimukha (54) Gharapure, transl., Y?jnavalkyasmrti with Mit?ksar? and VIramitrodaya, Bombay 1936-40.

The V?yupur?na II 44.57 states that Vin?yaka had the form of an elephant {gajar?pi Vin?yakah). The V?yu II 46.68 describes Vighnesa as having the form of an elephant: gaja r?pena vighneso. Mastyapur?na 260.52 describes Vin?yaka as gajavaktram 'elephant faced'. In the Visnudharmottarapur?na III 71.13-16 (5th century A.D.) Vin?yaka is described as gajavaktra 'elephant faced'. In the Bh?gavatapur?na 1.1-39 (6th century A.D.) Vin?yaka is described, inter alia, as ekadanta 'one-tusked' (a feature of the classical Ganesa having one of his tusks broken), Gaj?nana 'elephant-faced'. It has been shown above that gr?madevat? saptam?trk?s or d?kinis, were closely associated with Vin?yaka as they shared with him his functional role as Vighnakart? 'causer of obstacles' and inflicting suffering on their victims. It appears that Vin?yaka appropriated to himself the elephantine features of Vain?yaki, Gajamukh?, Hastimukh?, Gaj?nan?. This made Vin?yaka truly representative of evil spirits: Skanda, M?trs especially Jyesth? and Alaksmi (and later also of navagrahas, nine planets). 22, Nilakantha (8th century A.D.); No. 16, Kailash (750-850 A.D.), depicts astamatrkas with Ganesa.

This is also borne out by the sculptural representation of the early gr?madevat? phase of Vin?yaka ? he is represented as having disproportionate body, short stumpy legs with a developed trunk. The elephant face emphasized the non-Vedic and non-Brahmanical character of Vin?yaka. In fact, it would have been anomalous to fashion it in the image of the Brahmanical gods. It is true that the saptam?trk?s were conceived as possessing heads of various birds and animals; but elephant is the most powerful, intelligent and useful of animals, hence the selection of the elephant's head for fashioning Vin?yaka was natural. It found confirmation in the Indo-Greeks endowing Demetrios (2nd century B.C.) in his coins with an elephant scalp above his helm. Foreign influences also appear to have played a part in the evolution of an elephant headed deity in the Indian pantheon. In Indian iconography the theriomorphic beings like Kinnaras, N?gas, Vidy?dharas have usually been represented with a human head on an animal body. The only exceptions are certain avat?ras of Visnu, where the god is either an animal ? Matsya (fish), K?rma (tortoise) or Var?ha (boar) ? or is shown with an animal head over a human body such as Narasimha (man-lion), Hayagrtva (horse-headed Visnu). Sometimes Var?ha is depicted as having a human trunk with a boar's head. Demons (asuras) can be depicted as animal-headed such as mahis?sura (buffalo-headed monster) or gaj?sura (elephant-headed monster). Ganesa with his animal head over a human body is also an exception to the Indian iconographical practice of essentially depicting gods with anthropomorphic features. There is no avat?ra doctrine to explain this apparent iconographic 'aberration'. It may be that the animal (elephant) head is indicative of its demonical origins. Again its animal head as also the Puranic tales that P?rvati made Ganesa from the impurities (maid) of her body distinguished an originally folk deity from Vedic deities. But, there are also reasons to suggest that the concept of an elephant-headed god was an importation from Egypt via the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Middle East and the Indo-Greeks of northwestern India (62). According to ancient Egyptian zoolatry, the divine can manifest itself in animals and birds (63). In Egypt the earliest divinities were frequently represented in animal forms: Khanum, god of fecundity, as a ram: Anubis, god of the dead, as a jackal; Thoth, god of learning, as an ibis or baboon; Sobek, god of waterways, as a crocodile; Bastet, goddess of joy and love, as a cat; Apis as the sacred bull.

[17] 309</page><page sequence="18">concept of divinities in human form, these beings came to be conceived in therio anthropomorphic guise, with animal or bird heads and human bodies. So Ra, the sun, could be animal- or bird- or reptile-headed; Seth had the head of a donkey; Thoth that of an ibis or baboon; Sobek that of a crocodile; Sekhmet, the war goddess, that of a lioness; Thoueris, the goddess protecting women in child-birth, that of a female hippopotamus. It seems that the motif of an animal head was borrowed by the Hellenistic Greeks from Egypt, to emphasize that the king was a manifestation of divine power. The Seleucid monarchs, whose political and cultural power at its height extended from the Phoenician coast to the Hindu Kush, attributed an important symbolic role to the elephant head. The Bactrian general Demetrios, whose army won c. 180 B.C. a more lasting foothold in the Northwest than had Alexander's, had himself portrayed in profile on his coins with a kind of 'elephant scalp' at reduced scale above his helm (64). On some of Demetrios' coins which call him 'Supreme Being' (datable 190-171 B.C.), the figure of an elephant appears on the obverse with a caduceus on the reverse. In Indo-Greek coinage the obverse is usually reserved for a representation of the king who issued the coin, or the king whose memory it commemorates (65). Thus the elephant on the obverse can be identified symbolically with the 'Supreme Being' Demetrios. The caduceus was the Greek symbol of power that, inter alia, produced wealth and prosperity, the special features of Ganesa in Indian religious beliefs. IV. Vin?yaka or Ganesa and the Navagrahas Grabas are planets which are both malefic and beneficent in their influence on human beings. In Indian astronomy and astrology, the number of grahas is nine; the sun and the moon, the five recognized planets ? Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and the two mythical plantes, R?hu and Ketu, which cause eclipses. The word graha means 'seizing, laying hold of, 'a planet (as seizing or influencing the destinies of men in a supernatural manner)' (66). The Y?jnavalkyasmrti I 294-308, the Vaikh?nasasm?rtas?tra IV 13-14; the Baudh?yanagrhyasesas?tra, the Matsyapur?na 93.1-105, the Visnudharmottara I 93-105 and other pur?nas (67), etc. enjoin the performance of grahas?nti homa for obtaining prosperity or removing evil or calamities.

(65) The exceptions are the coins of Apollodotos I, Antimachos II, Telephus, and some of Menander I and Hermaeus. (66) Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, s.v. It is also the name of particular evil demons or spirits who seize or exercise a bad influence on the body and mind of man (causing insanity etc.). (67) See P.V. Kane, History of Dharmasastras, Vol. V, Pt. II, Poona 1977, p. 749. 310 [18]</page><page sequence="19">There is some evidence that the Ganesa cult is associated with the cult of the navagrahas 'nine planets' (68), which is late in date, i.e. c. 5th century A.D. and clearly of foreign origin. (i) Y?jnavalkyasmrti 271 (69) says that Vin?yaka, for the purpose of causing obstacles in the performance has been appointed at the headship of gams by Rudra and Brahma. The word gana also means a series or group of asterisms or lunar mansions classified under three heads (that of gods, that of men and that of r?ksasas or demons) (70). Again, Viramitrodaya a commentary on Y?jnavalkyasmrti, always associates the worhip of Vin?yaka with that of the grahas (71). (ii) According to the legends in the Brahmavaivartapur?na, Ganapati lost his human head due to the gaze of Sard or Saturn. (iii) According to the Garudapur?na (800-1000 A.D.) (72) at the close of the worship of Vin?yaka, inter alia, the tutelary deities of the planets should also be propitiated with worship. The sculptural evidence of the association of Ganapati with grahas is, however, limited and late. The temples at Bhubanesvara, Konarak and the Khandagiri caves (73), the wheel from Khiching (74) and the temple of Brhadisvara at Tanjavur (75) depict eight or nine grahas but no Ganesa. Ganesa in association with grahas is found on a fragment (late Gupta) from Sarnath (astagrahas) (76) depicting the mah?parinirv?na of the Buddha, an architectural fragment (11th century A.D.) from N?land? (77) and in a slab from Kankandighi in West Bangal (78). (68) According to C. Sivaramamurti, Art of India, New York 1977, p. 84, the navagrahas, eight in number, until the end of the Gupta period when Ketu was added, appear on the lintels of almost all northern shrines.

It is possible that the (b?la) graha adhipati of Susruta was confused with (jyotisa) graha adhipati lord of planets. In other words Skanda was deemed to be graha adhipati both of b?la and jyotisa grahas. When the evil traits of Skanda were shed and assimilated by Ganesa, Ganapati also acquired lordship of jyotisa grahas planets. (iv) Serpent (n?ga or sarpa) is an ornament of Vin?yaka or Ganesa. Serpent is an omen of evil. Hence its association with Vin?yaka was natural. In sculptures Ganesa is shown as having a sacred thread (yajnopavtta), girdle (katibandha), and stomach belt (udarabandha) of a n?ga. It is relevant that the sacred thread in the form of a snake is called vy?layajnopavita. The term vy?la means 'snake' as also 'mischievous', 'wicked', 'vicious'. So snake as an ornament of Ganesa is a badge of Vin?yaka being an imp, Vighnakart?. In the course of his evolution Ganesa was transformed from being Vighnakart? only to Vighnakart? also. Thus Ganesa had come to acquire a double personality, a being who causes impediments as well as removes impediments. Iconography reflects this transformation very clearly (79): early dvihhuja, two armed Ganesa, more precisely Vin?yaka, is an imp; the later caturbhuja, four armed, is a god. The G?napatyas were perhaps aware of this anomaly. They considered Ganapati as the Supreme spirit, higher than Siva, Visnu and Brahm?: the latter could not succeed in their enterprises if they ignored to worship Ganesa beforehand. This metamorphosis in the nature and character of Ganesa as a god is recorded graphically in a legend in the Skandapur?na and the Mudgalapur?na 4.50 &amp; 51. It tells us of the subduing of Vighn?sura by Gaj?nana. King Abhinandana performed a sacrifice at which he did not reserve a share of the offerings for Indra. This angered Indra who ordered K?la to destroy the sacrifice. K?la assumed the form of a demon called Vighn?sura. He started hampering the religious rites. The ascetics sought the help of Brahman who advised propitiation of Ganesa. So the texts record 'from that time, it was arranged that Vighna would make his appearance at any pious ceremony where Ganesa etc. are not worshipped or invoked. Having made this stipulation Ganesa put this Vighna nearby his own self (80). (79) A. Sundara, 'Early Sculptural forms of Ganesa in North Karnataka', Kusum?njali: C. Sivaramamurti Commemoration Volume, ed. M.S. Nagaraja Rao, Delhi 1987, p. 261, observes: 'The distinction between Ganesa as godhead (caturbhuja) and Vin?yaka and other ganas (dvibhuja) was clearly understood by Chalukyan artists'. (80) H.D. Mitra, op. cit., pp. 39-40. Mudgalapur?na, Bombay 1976: Mudgalapur?na 4.50 &amp; 51. The Vin?yakapur?na (Tamil) 71.18-118 contains the same myth: 'A king was performing a sacrifice to deprive Indra of his throne. Indra sent Vighna "obstacle" to put obstacles in the path of the king, but when Vighna ruined all sacrifices, the sages sought the help of Siva, who sent Ganesa to earth to help them. Ganesa fought against Vighna who worshipped Ganesa and was made one of his attendants, with an order to trouble all those who failed to worship Ganesa Lord of Obstacles' (cited in W. Doniger OTlaherty, 312 [20]</page><page sequence="21">The Padmapur?na Srstikhanda 40.458 narrates that Brahma assigned the overlordship of the Vin?yakas to Ganesa. This also indicates the disassociation of the two mutually opposing traits of Ganesa. It is evident that Ganesa had found the two roles, Vighnakart? and Vighnahartd as inconsistent. It shed the former to Vighn?sura and became Vighnahartd simpliciter from a malevolent deity as Vin?yka. Ganesa had now become a deity of auspiciousness, success and prosperity. Summary The line of development of the cult of Vin?yaka or Ganesa can now be summarized. 1.1. In the M?navagrhyas?tra, evil forces causing obstacles come to be called Vin?yakas, those which misguide and cause confusion, afflict their victims with diseases and cause impediments in the fulfilment of human efforts to achieve his objectives. In other words, the Vin?yakas are Vighnakart?. 1.2. In the Y?jnavalkyasmrti, the four Vin?yakas of the M?navagrhyas?tra are amalgamated into one Vin?yaka. He is now bh?taganapati, the leader (pati) of the troops or multitude {ganas) of bh?tas, evil beings, mah?ganapati. Since the term gana becomes quite common and easily well understood, that is, a generic term, bh?taganapati becomes mere ganapati or Ganesa. In other words, Ganapati really speaking, is bh?taganapati. 2. Skanda originally was a laukika or gr?madevat?, village or folk deity; and a b?lagraha who caused disease, suffering and evil. He, however, became the commander of the forces of the gods, devasen?pati and, in consequence, was admitted into the Brahmanic pantheon. The transformation of Skanda from a laukika or gr?madevat? into an alaukika devat?, Brahmanical god, was an important stage in the development of the cult of Vin?yaka inasmuch as he absorbs the evil-causing potentiality of Skanda. 3.1. Vin?yaka is closely associated with the saptam?trk?s. The pre-Gupta saptam?trk?s are personifications of disease, hunger and evil. These are non-Vedic folk deities; they are represented with animal or bird heads, as distinct from Vedic deities, who, as a rule, are benign and endowed with well-formed and pleasing human shapes. There is functional identity between Vin?yaka and the Saptam?trk?s. 3.2. One of the Saptam?trk?s is Gajamukh?, Hastimukh?, Gaj?nan?, being a form of the Vedic Jyesth? Alaksmi. 3.3. Vin?yaka as Vighnakart? and as a non-Vedic laukika or gr?madevat? appropriates to himself the elephantine features of another laukika or gr?madevat?, viz. the Gaj?nan? saptam?trk? inasmuch as they have functional identity. The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology, repr., Delhi 1988, p. 255. Devipur?na 115 also records the killing of Vighn?sura by Vin?yaka. It says that Vighn?sura was persecuting the devas. Vin?yaka taking a weapon from Sarhkara pierced Vighna and bound the Vighnas with his noose {Vighn?p?sena rodhitva). [21] 313</page><page sequence="22">3.4. The process of adoption of an elephant-headed god in the Indian pantheon appears to have been aided by certain foreign influences: ancient Egyptian gods were therianthropic ? animal or bird heads on human bodies; the use of 'elephant scalp' as the crown in the coins of Demetrios when the dominion of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Middle East and the Indo-Greek kingdoms of Northwestern India facilitated the penetration of Egyptian religious influences. 4.1. Navagrahas were believed to be responsible for ill-luck and suffering that might befall people. Their position in the horoscope or birth-chart was believed to affect a person's future. Both because of functional identity of causing evil and also as a successor to Skanda as b?la graha adhipati, lord of children's grahas, Ganesa or Vin?yaka came to be associated with (Jyotisa) (navd)grahas. Thus Vin?yaka or Ganesa is originally a laukika or gr?madevat?, par excellence, a mah?gr?mani. He is not only vighnakart? but also vighnesvara inasmuch as he combines in himself the evil-making and impediment-creating capacity of Skanda, the m?trk?s and the grahas. 4.2. The serpent (n?ga or sarpa) ornament also proclaims Ganesa's evil character. 5. Ganapati as a leader of the ganas causing evil, could also remove evil if propitiated, appeased and pleased. In fact, this is inherent in Vighnesvara, lord of evils. Hence he could also play the role of Vighnakart?. As P?rnasarasvati, a 15th century commentator explained, 'Vin?yaka is Ganapati so called because He puts down obstacles' (81). There was patent anomaly in this dual character of Ganesa. So eventually Vighnakart? was deemed to be a separate entity, Vighn?sura, but under the control of Ganesa. 6. As Vin?yaka was a gr?madevat? and also of evil-influence, those who performed ganay?gas, sacrifices in honour of ganas, were excluded by Manu 3.64 from participating in sr?ddha ceremonies. Govindar?ja in his commentary is unambiguous on this point; he says: Vin?yak?di-ganay?gakrta-varjyah, those who perform sacrifice ganay?ga in honour of Vin?yaka etc., are to be excluded from the sr?ddha feast. No wonder, there is a popular belief that Ganesa was the god of s?dras. A popular saying attributed to Manu, though not found in Manusmrti brings out vividly the comparatively low position of Vin?yaka or Ganapati in the hierarchy of gods: The god of Br?hmanas is Sambhu (Siva), of the Ksatriyas is M?dhava (Visnu), of the Vaisyas is Brahma, and of the S?dras is Ganan?yaka.
