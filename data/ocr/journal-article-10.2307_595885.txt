Nor can we expect to find such realistic details in this schematized art that we can speak confidently about cultic practices. We do not know whether masks were or were not used. There are important principles which must be followed in a study of prehistoric art: 1. The greatest circumspection must be used in drawing inferences about early periods from knowledge about later periods. 2. Perspective should be gained about the rela- tive popularity of particular forms of art in each period. 3. Interrelationships of forms must be observed. No design can be understood in isolation. These are not the only principles which are im- portant. Inasfar as they go, however, I believe them to be valid; and they are those most impor- tant for the particular details I have been dis- cussing in connection with Barnett's very fine book. WHO WERE THE MAGARIYA? NORMAN GOLB HEBREW UNION COLLEGE I. AMONG THE SECTS of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages described in Jewish and Islamic sources, there is one which, as a result of the manuscript discoveries at Khirbet Qumran in 1947 and the years following, has gained special promi- nence. We refer to the Magariya-a quasi-Jewish sect known only from some brief and enigmatic allusions in the medieval heresiographic literature. A tenth-century Qaraite writer, Ya'quib al-Qirqi- sani, states that the Magariya were called by that name only because books of theirs were found in a cave (Arabic magar); the Qumran manuscripts were also found in caves, and for this and a few other reasons which we shall presently examine, many writers believe that the Magariya were in reality the sect whose writings were discovered at Qumran-namely, the Essenes or at least an off- shoot of that sectarian group.1 Of the three major accounts concerning these so-called Magariya,2 that of Qirqisani is the earli- 1 Cf. especially de Vaux, in RB, LVII (1950), 421 ff.; Kahle, in Vetus Testamentum, I (1951), 44 ff.; idem, ThLZ, LXXVII (1952), cols. 401 ff.; idem, The Cairo Genizah (2nd ed., Oxford, 1959), pp. 24 ff.

Qirqisani writes, im- mediately after describing the doctrines of the Sadfiqiya (or Sadducees), that "the opinion of a sect called the Magarlya then manifested itself; they were called thus because their books were obtained in a cave. One of them is the Alex- wa'l-mardqib, ed. L. Nemoy (New Haven, 1939-43), pp. 11 f., 42, 59, 796 f.; (b) Abfi'l-Rayhan al-Birfni (973- 1048), Kitab al-dthdr al-bdqiya, ed.

It should be noticed that only the Qirqisani MSS preserve the reading Magariya. The Birfuni MSS used by Sachau have either Maqdriba (so MS Rawlinson), or Magdriba, while the Urfmi MS, according to informa- tion kindly supplied to me by Prof. Franz Rosenthal, apparently has al-Odriya; (N? 4667, fol. 313, line 11); the Shahrastani MSS have Maqdriba or Maqdriya (for the latter reading cf. de Sacy Chrest. Arabe I, Trad. [Paris, 1826], p. 362). In the 10th Century Kitab al-bida' wa'l-ta'rih of Mutahhar b. Tahir al-Maqdisi, ed. Huart, IV (Paris, 1907), 34 and 35, the sect of the Maqdriba is twice mentioned; however, since the author does not describe any of the outstanding doctrines of the Magariya, but instead states only that "the Maqariba allow travelling on the Sabbath and the cooking of food 347</page><page sequence="2">GOLB: Who were the Magdriya? andrian (al-isskandardni) whose book is famous and well-known; it is the finest book of the cave (or "the Magar[iya] "?) After it (i.e., in interest or importance) is a small booklet called the yp'l '1D; and it is also a fine book. As for the rest of their books, there is not one among them which makes sense-rather, most of them are mere tales resembling nonsense (wa-innama aktaruha ahbdrun sabihun bi 'I-hurafdti)." Qirqisani later describes the doctrines of the Magariya: They ob- served the new months when the moon becomes full (ida abdara 'l-hildl); a group of them did not allow laughter; they had strange, far-fetched in- terpretations of Biblical verses; they referred all anthropomorphic passages in the Bible to an angel rather than to God himself, and claimed that it was this angel who created the world.4 Still later Qirqisani says that the Magariya, along with the Saduiqiya, are extinct.5 Finally, he describes in some detail their " full-moon " doctrine: They contend that all things must have been created complete and perfect; so also when the heavenly bodies were created, they must have been complete and perfect. Therefore, since the first month of creation began with a full moon, all subsequent on that day," it is evident that he did not have in mind the same sect as that of the above-mentioned heresi- ographers. The same sect as that described by Qirqisani is men- tioned by the twelfth-century Byzantine Qaraite Judah Hadassi in his Eshkol ha-kofer (Eupatoria, 1836), pars. 97, 98. These passages represent a brief recapitulation of some of the doctrines of the Magariya as described by Qirqisani. There are several MSS extant of this work (cf. the list in Bammel, " Hohlenmenschen," ZNW, XLIX [1858], 82), each with numerous misspellings and textual variations, which are best explained as repre- senting the difficulties of later scribes in recording the name and doctrines of this obscure sect-of which they had no knowledge whatsoever, except for the informa- tion contained in Hadassi's book. It is hardly likely that the variations in the Hadassi MSS with regard to the spelling of the name of the sect and the (somewhat garbled) description of the doctrines indicate that there were two branches of the sect, or that Hadassi used other sources besides Qirqisani, as Bammel (ibid., pp. 81 ff.) urges. 8Qirqisani, op. cit., pp. 11f.; comp.

RB, ibid., p. 422. The text reads in part: za'amiQ anna 'lldh . . . balaqa kulla sayin mina 'l-ajsdmi ft awa'ili 'l-6baliqa kdmilan tamman wa-ddlika mitlu dddm wa-hawwd wa-gairihimd mina 'I-hayawdni . . . wa-kaddlika al-nabdta . . . wa- kaddlika balaqa jirma kulli wahidin mina 'l-niraini 'lladaini humd 'l-samsu wa-'l-qamru ma'a sd'iri 'l-kawd- kibi 'ald gdyati ma yakfnu mina 'I-kamdl . . . wa-kdna dalika yauma 'l-arbi'd'i wa-ld hilfa anna dalika kdna yauma ra'si 'l-sahr etc. In this passage Qirqisani states that the Magariya contended that God created all things complete and perfect during the first days of creation, a statement which apparently contradicts his earlier one (ibid., p. 42) to the effect that they contended that an angel had created the (material) world. Now the doc- trine of the demiurge is clearly a basic tenet among the beliefs of the sect; at the same time, it is difficult to view the above statement of Qirqisani as being merely a lapsus calami. The reason for Qirqisani's using the phraseology za'amui anna 'lldh etc. instead of za'ami anna 'l-malak become evident when we consider that, had he used the latter, he would then have given the appearance of admitting the truth of their demiurge doctrine in the process of refuting their calendrical views. 7 So we interpret the phrase (Kitdb al-anwdr, p. 42, lines 5 f.), wa-hakd 'ani 'l-magariya dudda ddlika, which immediately follows Qirqisani's statement to the effect that "Da'ud ibn Marwan, in one of his books, has written of the $aduikiya that they ascribed bodily at- tributes to the Creator . . . holding to the external sense of those attributes described by Scripture which neces- sarily imply corporeality." Nemoy vocalizes the follow- ing verb as a passive, wa-hukiya (i.e., "the opposite is written of the Magariya etc."), but I believe the con- text favors the former interpretation. Poznanski goes somewhat further in saying (REJ, L [1905], 15), ".. quoique cette derniere particularite soit seule in- diquee au nom de David b. Merwan . . ., on peut tenir pour certain que c'est a cet auteur que sont empruntAs tous les reseignements relatifs aux Maghariya et i leurs ecrits, comme c'est chez lui que Kirkisani a puise tout ce qu'il rapporte sur les plus anciennes sectes."

In the account of al-Biruni,9 however, there is a certain difficulty. The fact that the BirIni manuscripts have other spellings than al-Magariya10 is not an insur- mountable difficulty, for the copyists may have read their own manuscripts incorrectly; but this author, who claims to have drawn his information from the Kitdb al-maqaldt of Abfu 'Isa al-Warraq (d. 909) goes on to say that the sect "contends that the feasts are not legal unless the moon rises full after sunset of the night of Wednesday, i.e., the night following the day of Tuesday; and that it should be in Palestine (!). For them this marks the beginning of the New Year; from this point the days and months are counted, and the rotation of the festivals begins. Their reason for this is that God created the two great lights on Wednesday. Likewise, they disallow the Passover except if it falls upon a Wednesday, and do not make obligatory its rules and ritual regulations upon anyone except those who live in Palestine. . . . 11 According to Birfini, it is apparent, the sect would only celebrate the New Year when, and if, the full moon of the new month rose on a Wednesday; this is unlike the formulation in Qirqisani, where only the first month of creation had to begin on Wednesday.12 There is little doubt that either Birfini or al-Warraq at this point failed to understand his source-for it is obvious that the full moon appears on a Wednesday only once every several years. The former writer apparently con- fused available statements about the plenilunar observance of the Magariya or Ashab al-badr13 with those containing a description of an Ananitic sect that always observed the Sabbath on a Wed- nesday, perhaps such as the one described by Bar- hebraeus in his Ecclesiastical Chronicle."

Poznanski in REJ, L (1905), 17 f., for a discussion of this passage and for the possible connection of these sectarians with ing to Qirqisani, the Magariya believed that only the New Month of Creation had had to begin on a Wednesday (but that all other new months began on any day of the week, depending only upon the moon's fullness). Al-Warraq or Birfini seems to have associated this idea with that of the regular observance of the Sabbath on a Wednesday, such as was practised by the group mentioned by Barhe- braeus. We may, furthermore, give no credence to Birfini's statement that the observance of Passover, in the view of the Magariya, was incumbent only upon those living in Palestine. This is so similar to the view of certain Qaraites, especially the followers of the early schismatic Yudgan, or "Judah the Persian," who claimed that the festivals were not incumbent upon the Jews during the period of Exile, that we must have before us a confusion with sectarians of this latter type.15 Like Bir,ni, Shahrastani16 knows of no '1D y1T1 or Book of the Alexandrian; furthermore, he is altogether silent about the calendar of the sect. (The names "Maqdriba" and "Maqdriya" may merely represent scribal errors, as with the Birfini manuscripts.) But Shahrastani does discuss at some length their cardinal doctrine of the angel: it was this angel who addressed the Prophets, and all anthropomorphisms in the Bible are to be ascribed to him. These Magariya, says Shahra- stani, flourished four-hundred years before Arius, and " they are men of piety and self-mortification." Shahrastani fails to mention that the Magariya also believed that this angel was the creator of the world; and he is obviously in error when stating that it was Benjamin of Nihawand who taught them their doctrines,17 since this latter figure was the followers of a certain al-Matari. Cf. further Har- kavy in Graetz, Dibre yeme yisrd'el III, 419 f. 16 On the Yudganiya, cf. Qirqisani, Kitab al-anwdr, pp. 13, 52 f. (= HUCA, VII [1930], 328, 383).

(dealing primarily with those who deny the validity of Pentecost in exile). Birfini must have had a source similar to Shahrastani's at this point, since the latter places the "Maqariba" among the "Yud'aniya" (!) and the " Mukaniya" (!) 10 Cf. above, note 2.

Here again Qirqisani has the more correct information that Benjamin had a belief similar to that of the earlier Magariya, namely that which involved the angel-creator.18 II. It is evident that the only source which can be relied upon with confidence for the description of the doctrines of the Magarlya is Qirqisani. What we may doubt in Qirqisani is the explanation of their name: he says, on his own authority appar- ently, that they were only called by that name because their books were found in a cave. But, as we have noticed above,19 the other Arabic sources all have different spellings of the sect's name, while there is an eleventh-century reference to a sect known as the Badriya-that is, those adhering to the plenilunar doctrine.20 The name Magariya, therefore, may in itself be erroneous. This latter fact alone is sufficient to cast some suspicion on the popular theory that the so-called Magariya were the Qumran covenanters whose writings were discovered in some caves. But even if we do accept the spelling of the name and the explanation offered by Qirqisani, the fact remains that there is nothing unique about the story of the discovery of Hebrew manuscripts in a cave. There were at least five similar traditions extant in medieval times. (a) The earliest is that related by Timotheus I of Seleucia (726-819) who toward the end of his life wrote in a letter to Sergius Metropolitan of Elam to the effect that he had learned from some Jewish converts that Hebrew books, some of them containing "more than 200 Psalms of David," had been found in a "rock-dwelling near Jericho" approximately ten years before the composition of the letter (i.e., circa 800). Some writers be- lieve that Timotheus was alluding to the Qumran qarrara lahum hdda 'l-madhab wa-a'lamahum anna 'l-aydta 'l-mutasdbiha fi 'I-tawriya kulluha mu'awwala. 18 Qirqisani, op. cit., p. 42, line 8; p. 55, line 23 f.

Shaprut (915-990),22 there was an old tradition circulating among the Spanish Jews of that period to the effect that in former generations certain of the Jews,-i. e., those who eventually migrated to Khazaria-being faithless, were punished by an " army of the Chal- daeans" which "rose up in wrath against them. The people hid the books of the Torah and the (other) holy Scriptures in a cave; and for this reason would they pray in (by?) the cave. Because of the books, they taught their sons to pray in (by?) the cave both morning and evening.... In the course of time they forgot the reason for cus- tomarily praying within (by?) it. ... Finally a Jew arose and, seeking to know the reason there- for, came into the cave and found it filled with books. He brought them out, and from that time forth did they (the Khazar Jews) set out to study the Torah." According to the letter, these rebel- lious Jews were originally located on "Mt. Seir," but it is uncertain whether the place meant is an area near the Dead Sea in Palestine, or in the Caucasus; some writers favor the former location, but it will be observed that the above story is a kind of response to, or amplification of, the question asked by Hasdai, " How did it befall that Israelites 21 The Timotheus letter was first made known by Braun, Oriens Christianus I (1901), 138-152; Eissfeldt, ThLZ, LXXIV (1949), cols. 597 f., was the first to sug- gest the possibility of a connection between the events described by Timotheus and the Qumran discoveries. Among those who believe there is a direct relationship are de Vaux, RB, LVII (1950), 417 ff.; Kahle, VT, I (1951), 41 ff.; Driver, The Hebrew Scrolls (London, 1951), pp. 25 ff.; Lieberman, PAAJR, XX (1951), 402; Teicher, JJS, II (1951), 89 f.; Schonfield, Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls (London, 1956), p. 48. 22 The text of this letter is contained in an Oxford MS (Christ Church College MS 193); it was published first by Isaac b.

"-that is to say, the land of the Khazars. The sentence quoted above, to the effect that the Jew who discovered the manuscripts in the cave brought them out, "and from that time forth did they set out to study the Torah" is Hasdai's tentative answer to his own question, "How did it befall that Israelites are in that place ? " It is surely difficult to link up this story with the Qumran discoveries in Palestine, although this attempt has indeed been made; 23 and a con- nection with the Magariya or the Essenes is cer- tainly out of the question, if for no other reason then that the Khazars were by no means thought to be sectarian Jews. (c) In the Cambridge Document describing the conversion of the Khazars to Judaism, the Khazar princes say to the Jewish sages: 24 "Behold, there is a cave in the Valley of Tizul; bring forth for us the books which are there and explain them to us"; The sages go to the cave and find therein "three books of the Law of Moses" which they duly explain to the Princes; thereafter "Israel, together with the men of Khazaria" make a com- plete repentance. Where the Valley of Tizul lies is unknown,25 but it is at all events difficult to see how this site can be identified with Wadi Qumran in Palestine; and there is surely nothing here to identify Tizul cave manuscripts-whatever they are-with books of the Magariya.

Dunlop adds: "Confirmation seems to be available in the other form of the conversion story, for according to the Kuzari the scene of the conversion was partly in a cave where certain Jews kept the Sabbath in the moun- tains of Warsan. This should be the same locality, at the east end of the Caucasus." According to Judah Halevi's Kit&amp;b al-khazdri, ed.

David and his cohorts would record (i. e., in book form) heretical statements and lies and would bury them in the ground; thereafter they would take them out and say 'Thus and so have we found (written) in the ancient books.'" 26 Here it is claimed that such an accusation could not simply have been invented by the Rabbanites, but that it had to be based on some reliable and authentic tradition; 27 now this is surely questionable, but at all events has nothing to do with Qumran or the Magariya, whose writ- ings were never even claimed by the Qaraites to have had some relationship with their own. (e) According to a Jewish tradition, Simeon b. Yohai and his son El'azar composed the Zohar during their thirteen years of hiding in a cave; their students thereafter found portions of that work and bound them together, the result being the Zohar in its present form.28 Apparently no one has as yet introduced this tale into the Qumran discussion, but its very presence illustrates the 26 Cf. Blumenfeld, Osar nehmdd, III (Vienna, 1860), 62. This information is supplied by Lieberman, PAAJR, XX (1951), 402, who states that "Prof. Paul Kahle's theory about the discovery of the cave in the eighth century and the sale of part of its contents to the Jews is very credible" and that in the light of this fact the passage by R. Moses of Tachau "assumes special im- portance." 27 Cf. Lieberman, ibid., p. 403, who states that it is "quite evident that this claim of the Karaites could not possibly be invented by the Rabbis; they had abso- lutely no reason for crediting the Karaites with the contention that they found their doctrines in previously hidden books." Lieberman goes on to say that the Rabbis "had a good tradition to this effect, and they charged that Anan and his friends themselves wrote the books which the Karaites subsequently unearthed." Ac- cording to R. Moses of Tachau, what the Rabbis contended was that the early Qaraites claimed to have found their doctrines in ancient books, not in hidden books, while the Rabbis accused the Qaraites of hiding their sectarian books in the ground, digging them up, and thereafter claiming that they were ancient. Evidently, the only "good tradition" we may observe here is that dealing with the Qaraites' claim that they possessed ancient books. The accusation that they hid books and dug them up and then claimed that they were ancient is highly polemical, and is surely to be doubted; nor does it do much good to claim that the passage really indicates the Qaraites did indeed find ancient MSS "hidden in the ground." 28 Cf.

The explana- tion of the name "Magariya" represents such a tradition, and it is evident that no special connec- tion with the Qumran discoveries can legitimately be read into it. III. But certain other evidence in support of the Qumran/Essene-Magarlya hypothesis has been adduced. It is known that Philo evinced a most sympathetic attitude toward the Essenes, and some writers have in the past claimed that the "Alex- andrian" mentioned by Qirqisani was certainly Philo (see below, section IV); so that it has been suggested that "it was most natural, therefore, for a library of the Essenes to contain copies of Philo's books."29 Now it is hardly likely that this is what happened-the fact that Philo knew about the Palestinian Essenes does not at all imply that those Essenes knew about Philo, and that they had copies of his (Greek!) writings. It is possible that the Egyptian Therapeutae30 possessed Phi- lonic treatises; but these "lovers of the contempla- tive life" were not by any means the same sect as the Essenes,31 nor would the medieval heresiogra- phers have been likely to make the inference that they were the same-if, to be sure, they even knew of them. The identification of the Magariya with either the Qumran sect or the Essenes in general is made difficult by still other considerations-the main doctrines of the Magariya do not conform to those of the Covenanters or of the Essenes as described by Josephus or Philo.

Cf. further There is no doctrine of an angel-creator-or de- miurge-either in the sectarian Qumran writings or in the Greek literature describing the Essenes; nor did these sectarians refer anthropomorphic passages in the Bible to an angel rather than to God himself.33 It is doubtful whether an author of the ninth or tenth century would speak of the type of exegesis prevalent in such writings as the Habakkuk Commentary as hurafdt-foolish, won- sensical statements; on the contrary, it was con- siderably akin to the type of allegorical prognosti- cation in use among certain of the Qaraites of the ninth and tenth centuries.34 Assuming that Qirqisani meant Philo in referring to the "Alex- andrian," there is no mention of Philo-or even Alexandria or an Alexandrian-anywhere in the Qumran literature, and, what is more, there is nothing there remotely approaching Philo's philo- sophical or exegetical system. It seems that no complete certainty exists at the present time with regard to the calendar of the QumrSn sect. The most commonly held view is that the sect followed the calendar of Jubilees, a work which is even referred to in the zadokite Fragments (XVI: 3-4).35 A few writers have urged with considerable cogency that the author of Jubilees, and therefore the Qumran writers, Barth6lemy and Milik, Discoveries in the Judaean Desert I (Oxford, 1955), 109; the editors prefer the IQSa read- ing hhgy to hhgw, remarking (op. cit., p. 113) that the former spelling "est un substantif caractAristique de l'arameen palestinien" and that "le scribe post6rieur de CD aura confondu yod et waw en ce mot qui ne lui etait plus familier." These, however, do not constitute compelling reasons for preferring the one form to the other. 83 For the elucidation of the angel-doctrines in the Qumran texts, cf. especially Otzen, "Die neugefundenen hebriischen Sektenschriften und die Testamente der zwolf Patriarchen," ST, VII (1954), 125-57; Yadin, Megillat milhemet b'ne 6r bib'ne hoshekh (Mosad Bialik, Jerusalem, 1956), pp. 209-221; Licht, Megillat ha- hodayot (Jerusalem, 1957), pp. 49 f.; Strugnell, "The Angelic Liturgy at Qumran," VT Supplements, VII (1960), 318-345.

All that is held in common between the author of Jubilees (if the interpretation of the data there is as given by the authors cited above) and Biriini's Maqariba is the fascination with Wednesday-but it is this very detail which appears in the medieval description of a Jewish sect other than the Magariya (cf. above, note 14). QirqisanI's Magariya, and evidently the Badriya or Ashab al-Badr of other writers (cf. above, note 20), did not observe the New Month only on a Wednesday, but on whatever day in the week the full moon happened to appear; for according to them, only the first month of creation had had to begin on a Wednesday, on which day the luminaries were created "complete and perfect." Amidst all this, it is claimed by still another writer on the basis of some fragments from Qumran Cave IV that the sectarians attempted to synchronize their "religious calendar," supposedly the same as that espoused in the book of Jubilees, with a lunisolar calendar of "twelve months with alternatively twenty-nine and thirty days and a month intercalated every three years."37 Later on the same writer claims that "further study of the Mismarot from Cave IV, not yet finished, seems to favor the assumption that the Essenes computed the beginning of their lunar month from the full moon, not the new moon...." 3 Whether this was indeed the case remains to be seen on the basis of the future publication of the pertinent fragments from Cave IV; since, however, writers on the subject (including the one in question) are in agreement that the religious calendar of the sect was that of the Book of Jubilees,-namely, a solar 36 Cf. Jaubert, ibid., pp. 251 ff.; Talmon, ibid., pp. 177ff. 37 Milik, Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judaea (Naperville, 1959), p. 108. Cf. also idem, VT Supplements, IV (1957), 24 f. 8 Idem, Ten Years of Discovery, p. 152; cf. also the discussion in Burrows, More Light on the Dead Sea Scrolls (New York, 1958), pp. 373 ff. calendar- and since both Qirqisani and Birfini agree that the Magariya's religious calendar was strictly lunar in nature, there is nothing whatever in the evidence that has been adduced to bring the basic religious calendar of the Qumran sect into consonance with that of the Magariya. If it emerges that the Qumran sect did know of a pleni- lunar calendar as well, it will still be evident that they did not observe their Sabbaths and festivals according to it. Such evidence would only indi- cate that a calendar of this kind was actually in use in late Hellenistic times, and that the Qumran sect had occasion to refer to it. But this would hardly be sufficient to account for Qirqisani's de- scription or even for those of the other writers. Only on one point of doctrine do these Magariya seem to agree with the Qumrin Covenanters. According to the Manual of Discipline (VII. 4), anyone who "laughs in foolishness (be-siklat), making his voice audible (le-hasmi'a qolo), is to be punished for thirty days." Of the Magariya, Qirqisani states that "it is related of them that there was a group of them who did not allow laughter" (Kitdb al-anwar, p. 42, lines 2f.). Qirqisani states that some of the Magariya pro- hibited laughter outright, whereas the formulation in the Manual is somewhat different: mirth as such is not disallowed, but only loud, foolish laughter -for this reason the author adds the phrases be-sikclut and le-hasmra qolo. In a similar vein, Clement of Alexandria, in his espousal of restraint in the Paedagogus, states: "The proper relaxation of the features within due limits ... is called a smile (IeLSt'a/a) . . . ; it is the good humor of the self-contained. But the sudden loss of control over one's composure, in the case of women, is called a giggle (KLXXLArto) . . .and in the case of men, a guffaw (KayXaaouo') ... offensive to the ear. 'A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter,' Scripture says, 'but a cunning man will scarce laugh low to himself' (Ecclesiasticus 21: 23)."39 Among the Therapeutae, restraint was a virtue to be assidu- ously cultivated;40 and we may say, indeed, that 9 Cf.

The Qumran-Magariya hypothesis is not, we submit, really convincing; but neither is that theory which places the Magariya among the medieval Qaraite sects.42 According to this view, the available evidence will allow us to infer that these sectarians existed and perhaps originated in Islamic times, and further, that Qumran manu- scripts discovered at the beginning of the ninth century mainly influenced these medieval Maga- riya, and only indirectly other groups.43 Now the Magariya doctrines known to us are not, in the 41 For this same prohibition among a few of the more ascetically-inclined rabbis, cf.

On the Bene- dictine practice, cf. the dictum of St. Benedict: "Deci- mus humilitatis gradus est, si non sit facilis ac promptus in risu, quia scriptum est: Stultus in risu exaltat vocem suam." Cf. Delatte, The Rule of St. Benedict, 3rd ed.

Bammel, ibid., p. 81: " (Kirkisani) will nur die Lehre der Sekte als in vorchristlicher Zeit aufgekommen angesehen. Das macht es wahrscheinlich, dass er die Entstehung der Sekte selbst mit dem Fund in Verbin- dung bringt." Ibid., p. 86: "... znviel spricht dafiir, dass die Sekte in spaterer Zeit exitiert und, verstehen wir Kirkisani recht, da erst ihren Anfang genommen hat." Ibid., p. 87 f.: "Dieser Tatbestand erklirt sich am ehesten, wenn man annimmt, dass sich die Wirkung der Hohlenschriften besonders auf einen engeren Kreis, von den Gegnern Maghariten genannt, erstreckte. Einige, sich bald entzweiende Gruppen in der durch Anan angefachten Bewegung, einige fliichtige Kristal- lisierungen in dem turbulenten neunten Jahrhundert, das ist es, was sich aus den Hohlenfunden zuniichst ergeben hat. Indirekte Wirkungen sind damit nicht ausgeschlossen." Cf. also above, note 2, end. main, identical with the earlier Qumran doctrines; so that even assuming the fact that the Magariya originated in the Middle Ages and that they were called by this name because their doctrines were taken over from older sectarians whose books had been found by them in a cave (so Qirqisani's state- ment, Kitdb al-anwdr, p. 11 bottom, wa-zahara qawlun li-qawmin yuqalu lahumu 'l-magdfrya wa- innama usmiyii bi-hdda li-anna kutubahum usibat fi magdrin, is ingeniously interpreted in the essay under discussion),44 there would still be nothing here to indicate the influence of Qumran docu- ments upon the Magariya. One must, however, also have reservations about the interpretation of the Qirqisani passage just quoted. If Qirqisani had wished to indicate that the Magariya were the ones who found the earlier sectarian writings in a cave, he would surely have said that they were called by that name because they had obtained their ancient writings in a cave, viz. li-anna asdbu kutubahum fi magdrin, and not li-anna Icutubahum usi.bat fi magdrin (= since their writings were obtained [i. e., by others] in a cave). Furthermore, if the sect had had its origin in the Middle Ages, we would expect Qirqisini to know considerably more about it than he indicates. The fact that he had to use al-Muqammas for at least part of his (scanty!) information makes it evident that the writings of the Magarlya were no longer accessible to him-unlike those of Anan ben David, Daniel al-Qumisl, Benjamin al-Nihawandi and other early medieval sectarians whose views and writings were well known to Qirqisani. Indeed, Qirqisani explicitly states that the Magariya and Saduqiya-and he places these two sects together- are among those sects which are entirely extinct; so that we may say, in conclusion, that as far as Qirqisani is concerned, this sect was an ancient rather than a medieval one. Evidence in the other heresiographic literature for the proposal that the Magiarya were a medieval sect is entirely lacking. IV. In summarizing the foregoing discussion, it may be stated that no present theory adequately explains who the Magariya were. Is there, then, any possibility of identifying them at all? The evidence that may be considered reliable is as fol- lows: a) The Magariya believed that a demiurge rather than God created the world; b) they pos- sessed books containing "fantastic and far- " Bammel, ibid., pp. 80 f., 86 f. 354</page><page sequence="9">GOLB: Who were the Magdriya? fetched" ideas; c) they had ascetic tendencies; d) they believed that during the week of creation all things had been created "full and perfect"; e) they celebrated the new month when the moon was full; f) they flourished considerably before the inception of the Middle Ages; g) two of the books ascribed to them in the Middle Ages were the Y'11T IDD and the book of the Alexandrian. By previous writers the "Alexandrian " has been identified with Philo.45 Indeed, it is evident that some Philonic ideas were known in the tenth cen- tury, and that they were in at least a few cases correctly ascribed to Philo. In a manuscript frag- ment of the Kitdb al-tamyiz of Saadia Gaon, for example, it is apparently Philo who is called "Judah the Alexandrian," although the doctrine ascribed to him in that fragment is unknown from the extant works of Philo.46 A fifteenth-century Qaraite writer, Samuel b. Moses al-Magribi, states that ". . . al-Qirqisani and other scholars have mentioned ten 'useful principles' quoted from (the writings of) the Alexandrian."47 Further- more, another manuscript fragment, which is evi- dently from Part VI of the Kitdb al-anwdr, men- tions the "Prolegomena of the Alexandrian," (muqaddimat al-iskandardni), and the quotation which follows from that work is almost identical with a passage from Philo's De decalogo in which Philo discourses on the reasons for God's having chosen to reveal the Law in the desert rather than in a city.48 In view of this last passage especially, it seems clear that in the tenth century it was indeed Philo who was called the "Alexandrian," 45 Cf. Harkavy, Zapiski Vostochnago Otdyeleniya Im- peratorskago Russkago Arkheologicheskago Obshchestva (Transactions of the Oriental Division of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society), VIII (Leningrad, 1894), 256 if.; idem, in Heb. Graetz, III, 498; Poznanski, REJ, L (1905), 10 ff. B. Revel, The Karaite Halakah (Philadelphia, 1913), pp. 86 f., goes too far, however, in inferring that the works of Philo were read in the middle ages especially by Qaraitic codifiers who there- upon assimilated Philonian legal views into their own halakhic systems. 4' Cf. Hirschfeld, JQR, XVI (1904), 103; Poznanski, REJ, L (1905), 26 f. "7 Poznanski, ibid., p. 23. 48 Poznanski, ibid., pp. 24 f. It will be observed that this passage is not in the published text of the Kitdb al-anwdr; it seems to me that it preceded Part VI, Ch. 3 (ed. Nemoy, p. 568). Cf. Philo, De decalogo, 2 f., = ed. t trans. Colson (Loeb Classical Library: Philo, VII [London, 1937]), pp. 6 ff. and that Qirqisanl's references to the "Alex- andrian" are really to Philo himself. There may be little doubt that Qirqisani and his predecessor Da'fid ibn Marwan al-Muqammas be- lieved that the Alexandrian, or Philo, was a mem- ber of the Magarian sect. It is another matter, however, whether this was actually the case. Only by an extreme distortion of the Philonic viewpoint about God and the Logos 49 could later writers have concluded that the Magarian view about the angel-creator was identical with that of Philo. The full-moon doctrine is nowhere discernible in the Philonic treatises.50 Philo allegorized Scrip- ture symbolically; but of the Magariya Qirqisani explicitly reports the following: (Kitdb al-anwdr, p. 42): "Da'uid ibn Marwan, in one of his books, has written of the Sadfqiya that they ascribed bodily attributes to the Creator . . . holding to the external sense of those attributes described by Scripture which necessarily imply corporeality. Of the Magariya he has written 51 the opposite of this, namely, that they would not speak of the cor- poreality of God-not that they would extricate those qualifying attributes from their external ,9 Cf. especially the discussion in Wolfson, Philo, I (Cambridge, Mass. 1947), 229 if.; on the nature of God's creation of the world, idem, pp. 295 if. 0 That Philo believed the first month of creation began with the new moon is quite evident from De opificio mundi 101 = ed. &amp; trans. Colson (Loeb Classical Library, Philo, I [London, 1949]), 80 f.: " (Seven) is a perfect number and equal to the sum of its own fac- tors. And the number produced is the number which brings the moon back to her original form, as she retraces her course by lessening till she reaches the shape from which she began to make perceptible in- crease; for she increases from her first shining as a crescent till she becomes a half moon in seven days, then in as many more she becomes full-moon, and again returns the same way like a runner in the double race- course, from the full to the half-moon in seven days as before, then from the half to the crescent in an equal number of days: these four sets of days complete the aforesaid number." That the calendar to which he adhered had thirty days per month is clear from De opificio mundi, 60 (ed. Colson, pp. 46 f.): "... out of one day came " one," out of two " two," out of three " three," out of a month "thirty," out of a year the number equivalent to the days made up of twelve months . . ." The last clause is apparently a circumlocution to avoid recording any particular number; the years were evi- dently intercalated, as Philo himself indicates when saying (ibid.) : "it is by regular revolutions of sun, moon, and the other bodies that days and months and years were constituted." 61 Cf. note 7 above. 355</page><page sequence="10">GOLB: Who were the Magariya? sense, but rather they would contend that these were descriptions of one of the angels, namely, the one who created the world." According to Da'ud ibn Marwan, the Magariya did not allegorize Scrip- ture, but rather took all anthropomorphic passages in their literal sense, ascribing such passages to an angel rather than to God.52 This is distinctly un- like the exegetical method of Philo. Philo never mentions Jewish sectarian associa- tions in his extant writings; it is, to be sure, ex- tremely doubtful whether he was ever a member of any sect. However, it is known that during his lifetime he was a man of eminence; his writings and views must have had considerable popularity, especially among the members of the Alexandrian community.53 And indeed, we may discern the presence of a Philonic idea in the beliefs of the Magarlya themselves. In the De opificio mundi,54 Philo states: " (God) next begins to put the earth in order; for he bids it bear grass and corn, and send forth herbs of all kinds, and rich pastures. . . . Besides these, he caused all kinds of trees to grow, leaving out no tree at all.... And, after a fashion quite contrary to the present order of Nature, all were laden with fruit as soon as ever they came into existence. For now the processes take place in turn, one at one time, one at another, not all of them simul- taneously at one season. For everyone knows that sowing and planting come first, the growth of the things sown and planted second .... After this come sproutings and puttings forth of leaves, and then to crown all, bearing of fruit. . . . Now in the original creation of all things, as I have said already, God caused all shrubs and plants to spring out of the earth perfect (TeXelav) having fruits not unripe but at their prime, to be perfectly ready for the immediate use and enjoyment of the animals that were forthwith to come into being...." This view, which also appears later in the rab- binic literature,55 is clearly reflected in the beliefs 52 Cf. also the statement in Shahrastani, op. cit., pp. 169 f.: wa-za'amat firqa min al-maqdriba (sic!) anna 'llCh ...

Colson, pp. 30 ff. 55 Cf. e. g. Gen. Rabba X. 4, ve-oto ha-y6m 'asu perOt of the Magariya, who, according to Qirqisani, con- tended that all things were created " complete and perfect" (kamilan tamman) at the beginning of Creation.56 The Magariya, however, go beyond Philo-for they contend that not only the things of this earth, but also the heavenly bodies, were created full and perfect; and this leads them to the view that the months must of necessity begin when the moon is full. Now the radicalization of this concept prominently associated with Philo is fully understandable in the Magarlya, who con- tended that God himself did not actually create the material world, and, furthermore, that not God but only the angel-creator ever spoke with man.57 According to Philo, communication between God and man was not effected only by means of an angel, but was at times brought about through God's " divine spirit" and at times directly by God ben ymdan, from which it is evident that the authority to whom this passage is ascribed considered that the fruits sprang forth immediately (cf. also Sifra on Lev. XXVI. 4, ed. Weiss, 110b). A few other passages in Gen. Rabba (XII. 6, XIV. 7, comp. B. Rosh Hashana lla, Hullin 60a) speak of the earth or the objects thereof being created 'al mele'dtdn; but it is evident from the context of all these passages that what is here meant is that all the things of the world were originally created with greater height and fullness than they now possess; the moon, for example, was originally as powerful as the sun, but because of man's sin there occurred a weakening of its power (cf. especially Gen. Rabba XII. 6). In the Seder olam, ch. 4, the following state- ment is ascribed to R. El'azar: "From the beginning of the creation of the days of the world, the days of the sun exceed the days of the moon by 11 days, as they were created full, 15 days (fifteen days old?)." Of this passage, however, Marx (Seder Olam, Berlin, 1903, p. 18) remarks: " Der Schluss des Kapitels von R. El'azar an fehlt in mehreren guten Handschriften, sodass seine Echtheit sehr zweifelhaft ist." It is difficult to see how Ginzberg (Legends of the Jews, V [Philadelphia, 1925], 36), on the basis of this passage alone, can come to the conclusion that, according to the rabbis, "like all first things created, the moon was created in a fully developed form, so that there was full moon on the fourth day of creation." But however these passages be interpreted, it it evident that the Magarian view derives from the Alexandrian environment, and not from the Rabbis of Palestine and Babylonia in the second and third cen- turies.

A further consideration of the other known facts pertaining to the Magariya enables us to clarify to some extent the nature and significance of the relationship between the "Alexandrian" and the Magariya, and even to approach the identification of this sect. The Magariyan Sefer yddo'a (this vocalization seems preferable to Sefer yaddi'a which can only mean "The Book of a man named Yaddf'a" or Sefer yddu'a, which must mean a 58 Cf. especially the discussion in Wolfson, Philo, II (Cambridge, Mass., 1947), 23 ff. 69 This latter interpretation is rightly objected to by Poznanski, REJ, L (1905), 14, n. 1, who says "I1 est impossible d'en expliquer le titre par . . . 'Livre connu,' car, dans ces temps anciens, on ne donnait guere aux ouvrages des titres de cette sorte." But Poznanski's hypothesis (cf. also Harkavy in Graetz, Dibre yeme yisrd'el, III, 498), that the book was written by a man named Yaddu'a (cf. Neh. X. 22 sqq.; Josephus Ant. XI. viii. 3; EJ VIII, p. 751) is not much better. For this interpretation we would expect some phrase such as minhum al-iskandaranz wa-kitdbuhu mashur ma'ruf . . . wa-lahum aidan kutayyib fagir li-rajulin yuqdlu lahu yaddu'a. Far more in consonance with the formulation in Qirqisani is the explanation of the word ydw' as an infinitive absolute, and it is in this way that I have interpreted it above. 6O Cf. especially the discussion in Mead, Pistis Sophia (London, 1896) pp. xxxiii f. (This work was composed probably in Alexandria during the second century). It should be observed that the so-called " First Book of Iao (Jeu) " opens with the words " This is the Book of Knowledge of the Invisible God"; cf. Schmidt, Koptisch-Gnostische Schriften, I (GCS, Leipzig, 1905), 257. 61 In De vita contemplativa, 28 (ed. Colson, pp. 128 ff.) Loeb Classical Series, Philo, IX [London, 1954], 128 f.) it is said that the Therapeutae "read the Holy Scrip- tures and seek wisdom from their ancestral philosophy by taking it as an allegory, since they think that the words of the literal text are symbols of something whose hidden nature is revealed by studying the underlying meaning" (cf. Colson's note ibid. Conybeare translates the last phrase as "literal meaning"). It is evident that in their allegorical method they stood close to Philo, who enthusiastically endorses their manner of studying and elucidating scripture. The allegorical, symbolic method of scriptural interpretation at once sets the Therapeutae apart from the Magariya. Both of these groups had ascetic tendencies, but the parallel ceases there: for, in addition to having a different method of Scriptural interpretation, the Therapeutae did not believe in a demiurge, nor did they hold that the month began when the moon was full. Furthermore, the nonsensical "known book" 59) is a book of "know- ing," that is, of gnosis; with such a book-title in antiquity we may compare the Qumran Sefer he-hdgo, or the Valentinian Pistis Sophia.60 Qir- qisani, apparently drawing on an older authority, says of the Magariya that most of their books "are mere tales resembling nonsense," and that "they have far-fetched interpretations of certain Biblical passages, (interpretations) which resemble non- sense." What is evidently being alluded to here is not the allegorical method characteristic of Philo or the Therapeutae 61 but the mythological fantasies characteristic activities and beliefs of the Therapeutae are nowhere alluded to in the medieval notices about the Magariya. It was Harkavy's view (Graetz, Dibr? yeme yisrd'el, III, 497) that "when we investigate the par- ticulars mentioned about this sect (i.e. the Makarlya) it appears that it was no other than the sect of the Essenes and the Therapeutae" (my translation and italics). He therefore endeavors to prove this supposi- tion by combining the facts known about the Essenes with those known about the Therapeutae. The parallels with Essenism are certainly insufficient to prove any relationship (cf. sections II and III above), while those with the Therapeutae are few indeed; and at all events the Therapeutae may not be spoken of as a branch of Essenism. It was a different kind of sect, although sharing a few of the peculiarities of Essenism. Cf. the references in note 31, above. Qirqisani (Kitdb al-anwdr, pp. 12, 47), speaks of another Egyptian Jewish sect called the Qara'iya. He states (ibid., p. 12) that "it is said that on the Nile River, more than twenty parasangs from FustAf, is a group called the Qara'iya; they are called the Qara'iya only because they use vessels of gourds to the exclusion of any other kind of material; one of the Mutakallimin has written of them that they contend that they are descendants of Johanan ben Kareah." Later on (p. 47) Qirqisani conjectures that their custom of using gourd- vessels is connected with the statement of a writer (name unknown) to the effect that the Qara'iya stand close to the ~adfiqiya with regard to the laws of purity. (The complete text is translated by Nemoy, HUCA, VII [1930], 376 f.) Indeed, "one of the Mutakallimun" says of them that they "never put an outsider in charge of anything pertaining to (their own) sowing or har- vesting . . . It is also written of them that they observe Sunday along with Saturday." For his informa- tion about the Qara'iya, Qirqisani utilized several sources (as he himself tells us, ibid., p. 47)-namely the Kitdb al-dara'a of Da'id ibn Marwan al-Muqammas, an unnamed book on sects and heresies by a Mutakallim, name unknown, and still other writings which Qirqisani only alludes to, never by name. It seems, therefore, that the information he possessed about the Qara'iya was reliable. Now it is impossible to detect in the actual doctrines of the Qara'iya similarities with the Magiriya, or with the Essenes; while the only possible connection 357</page><page sequence="12">GOLB: Who were the Magdriya? of the gnostic writings,62 the meaning of which the Jewish heresiographers of the Middle Ages no longer comprehended. An important feature in gnostic mythological speculation, a characteristic, indeed, of gnosticism itself, is its preoccupation with the role of the archons and the demiurge,63 which latter among the medieval writers became the " angel who created the world." The radical- ized gnostic antagonism between the Supreme God and the demiurge, between spirit and matter, in- evitably led the gnostics to one of two alternatives -to the complete abandonment of morality and the indulgence in lust (e.g., Ophites, especially Cainites) or, on the other hand, to the utter rejec- tion of bodily pleasure and the most rigid asceti- cism (Saturnilus, Marcion, Tatian).64 The Magariya represent the ascetic type of gnostic sect. between the Qara'iya and the Therapeutae is on the basis that both of these sects were of Egyptian pro- venience; I do not, therefore, perceive what validity Harkavy's conjecture, to the effect that the Magariya and the Qara'iya were in reality branches of the same sect (cf. idem, Graetz, Dibre yeme yisrd'el, III, 497, 501), possesses-other than that the two had similar- sounding names. 62 Cf. especially the discussion in Jonas, Gnosis und spdtantiker Geist, I (Gottingen, 1934), 92ff.; II (GSt- tingen 1954), 122 ff.; idem, The Gnostic Religion (New York, 1958), pp. 49 ff.

Mansel, The Gnostic Heresies (London, 1874) pp. 134f., who quotes the observation of Neander (Church History, vol. II, p. 26) that " among the nobler and more sensible classes (this principle) . . . took the form of an extreme and rigid asceticism, of an anxious abhorrence of all contact with the world. . . . But the same eccentric hatred of the world, when coupled with pride and arrogance, might also lead to wild fanaticism and a bold contempt of all moral obligations. When the Gnostics had once started upon the principle that the whole of this world is the work of a finite, ungodlike spirit, and is not susceptible of any revelation of the Divine . . . they easily came to the conclusion that everything external is a matter of perfect indifference to the inner man. .. ." Cf. also Harnack, Dogmenge- schichte (3rd ed.), I (Freiburg and Leipzig 1894), 251 f.; Jonas, Gnosis und spdtantiker Geist, I, 233 ff.; cf. especially ibid., p. 236: " Marcion freilich wahlt nicht die libertinistische, sondern die entgegengesetzte, aske- tische Form der Absage an diesen Bereich weltnatiir- licher Bindungen: aber ob die Verachtung des Stoffes in Libertinismus oder Ertitung desselben in Askese-immer Alexandria, as we know, was during the second century, a prominent home of the gnostic specu- lators;65 and Philonic ideas were widely utilized by them.66 Indeed, if we combine all the evidence available to us-the reference to the "Alexan- drian," the traces of a Philonic concept among the doctrines of the sect, the presence of a Sefer ydd6'a and of strange and fantastic ideas in their writ- ings, the belief in a demiurge and the consequent asceticism-we are quite inevitably drawn to the conclusion that the Magarlya were Jewish gnostics of an ascetic character who flourished in Egypt during the first few centuries of the present era, and who had access to Philonic writings or ideas; it seems clear, furthermore, that a few of the writings of these Magariya did survive, perhaps in Syriac translation,67 until the ninth century, at ist die streitbare Verweigerung eines Weltanspruches, also Revolution gegen den gittlichen Autor desselben, der Sinn der Entscheidung."

Of Syriac gnostic writings, only those of a Christian nature have survived to the present day. One of them is known as the Me'dreth Gazze, or "Cave of Treasures " (cf. Bezold, Die Schatzh6hle [Leipzig, 1883]; Budge, The Book of the Cave of Treasures [London, 1927]). It is barely possible that a similar title was applied to one of the writings of the Magariya, and that this sect-name-if authentic-derives from an original confusion of the title of the book with the name of the sect. (For another possible interpretation of the name "Magariya," cf. above, note 20.) At the present time it is not possible to ascertain how Philo came to be considered a member of the sect. The Magariya perhaps claimed that Philo was a " true" gnostic, and thus really a member, or forerunner, of their sect; or perhaps later heresiologists understood references or allusions to Philonic writings or ideas in the books of the Magariya as implying that Philo had been one of their adherents. On the other hand, some Philonic writings may have been bound together with books of the Magariya, and, when discovered or trans- lated, may have been assumed to be Magariyan writings. 358</page><page sequence="13">GOLB: Who were the Magariya? which time the early Jewish and Islamic heresi- ographers utilized them as best they could. On this view, then, the Magariya were neither the Essenes,68 nor the Therapeutae, nor even the I believe that the interpretation best supported by the wording in Qirqisani is the last. 68 Cf. above, sections II and III. 8 On the difficulties in the way of identifying the Magariya with either the Therapeutae or the Qara'iya, cf. above, note 61. 70 As the "full-moon" doctrine associated with the Magariya is never alluded to, so far as I am aware, in the early literature describing the gnostic sects, a more precise identification of this group is virtually impossi- ble at the present time. But attention should be called to the fact that speculation concerning the significance of the plenilunium was widespread in early Christian times. To many of the Fathers, the moon symbolized the Church, the full moon the final Resurrection; while the appearance of the plenilunium of the Easter season was fraught with special meaning. Cf. especially H. Rahner, " Mysterium Lunae," Zeitschrift fiir katholische Theologie, LXIII (1939), 311-349, 428-442; LXIV (1940), 61-80, 121-131; idem, Eranos Jahrbuch, X (1943), 387 f., 395 ff. Mani contended that the moon was replenished by the luminous souls of mankind, which were deposited there after being purified by the sun's rays; the fullness of the moon indicated a pleni- tude of souls, and it was at its fullness that the moon commenced to carry these souls toward the east and to deposit them there among the Aeons of Light. Cf. Epiphanius, Panarion, Haeres. LXVI, xxi (Migne, PG, Vol. LXII, p. 74); Fliigel, Mani (Leipzig, 1862), pp. 8 f.; King, The Gnostics and their Remains (New York and London, 1887), pp. 48 f. (for the difference between the Christian and Mohammedan accounts, cf. Legge, Forerunners and Rivals of Christianity, II [Cambridge, 1915], 296 f.) This fascination with the full-moon took a different form among the Magariya, who believed that its appearance was the occasion for celebrating the new Egyptian Qara'iya 69-they were a unique Jewish sect known from no other sources 70 except those we have examined above.7' month. According to Qirqisani, the Magariya based their view on Biblical verses, such as Gen. I. 16 and Ps. LXXXIX. 38 (cf. above, note 6); however, the under- lying motivation for it may have had its roots in astral speculation. It is hardly surprising that in late-Hel- lenistic Alexandria, among whose religious circles astrally-oriented theological speculation was so infec- tiously popular (cf., e.g., Goodenough's masterly work, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period, VIII, ii [New York, 1958], 167-218), there should be found a Jewish sect which placed special emphasis on the sig- nificance of the plenilunium; and it is cause for some frustration that we only possess such late-and such meager-descriptions of this remarkable sectarian group. 71 The proposal that the Magariya were an Egyptian- Jewish gnostic sect was first made by the writer during the course of a lecture on the Qumran-Qaraite problem (on this problem cf. now Golb, "The Qumran Covenant- ers and the Later Jewish Sects," Journal of Religion, XLI, No. 1 [Jan., 1961]) delivered at the ninety-fourth meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis in New York City, December 30th, 1958; and the more fully-developed treatment of the subject was presented in approximately the same form as it is printed here (but somewhat condensed) at the one hundred and seventieth meeting of the American Oriental Society in New Haven, March 29th, 1960. At the conclusion of this meeting I was pleased to learn from Prof. Harry Wolfson that he had independently arrived at a conclusion closely similar to mine concern- ing the identity of the Magariya. The interested reader would do well to consult Prof. Wolfson's forthcoming essay on the subject, a comparison of which with my own will indicate in which areas we agree, and in which we diverge, with regard to the identity of this sect. I wish to thank my colleagues Profs. S. H. Blank and E. Epstein for their useful suggestions with regarding the style of this essay. 359</page></plain_text>
