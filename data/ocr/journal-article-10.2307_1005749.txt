In charge of the group was Dr. Daniel F. Rubin de la Borbolla, who, in addition to looking after his three stu- dent workers, endeared himself to the Chupicuareinos by innumerable favors and kindnesses. The Government of the State of Guanajuato as- sisted in many ways. I wish to express appreciation to Sefior Armando Olivares Carillo, Rector of the Uni- versity of Guanajuato, for his interest and support. I also wish to thank Lic. Antonio Arriaga, director of the regional museum in Morelia, Michoacan, and Dr. Camarino Espino of Ac'ambaro, Guanajuato, for their invaluable assistance in helping us initiate the field program. The Comision Nacional de Irrigacion loaned us the services of twenty local workmen, employed by the Solis Dam Project. We are grateful to Sefior Benja- min Navarro for his consistent cooperation. The work- men were Chupicuaro men and boys whose only previ- ous experience with pick and shovel had been in road construction. They proved to be unusually quick to learn, eager, interested, extremely alert and very co- operative. Indeed, we found all Chupicuarefios sincere, honest, and dependable. Sefior Carlos Mora was ap- pointed guardian of the archaeological zone and Sefior don Aurelio Lopez took charge of the workmen. Doina Julia Mora served us well as housekeeper and cook, besides washing many vessels from the dig. One of our outstanding workmen, Jesus Trujillo, "Chucho," later followed us to Mexico City where he worked at Tlatilco and has remained in the service of the Instituto Na- cional de Antropologia e Historia. To Drs. A. V. Kidder of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Gordon F. Ekholm of the American Museum of Natural History, and Isabel T. Kelly of the Institute of Interamerican Affairs, I am indebted for their interest in the Chupicuaro work and encourage- ment to make this study. Financial assistance, afforded by generous grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research and the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, made it possible for me to spend fifteen months in Mexico preparing the report. To these in- stitutions I am deeply grateful. The Museo Nacional de Arqueologia in Mexico City, under directorship first of Dr. Rubin de la Borbolla, and then of Dr. Eusebio Davalos, gave me every pos- sible assistance during my stay in Mexico. A labora- tory was renovated on the museum roof where I con- centrated all the Chupicuaro material. Srta. Elma Estrada Balmori and Sefnor Roman Pifia Chan have given their unfailing support and I wish to thank them for their cooperation both in the field and throughout subsequent years. From July to December, 1951, I was assisted in the Chupicuaro Laboratory by Sefior Armando Aguirre Torres, a student from Quito, Ecuador. Aguirre, hard working and interested in the project, helped me cata- log, label, and sketch some 3,000 objects. The photographs, although taken by myself, were made under the able direction of Sefior Arturo Romano P. who very graciously loaned me equipment and granted me access to the excellent photographic labora- tory of the Museo Nacional. To Sefiora Johanna Faulhaber and Srta. Adela Ra- mon, both of the Museo Nacional, and to Dr. Manuel Maldonado-Koerdell of the Instituto de Geologia, I am indebted for information and discussions on other sites in Mexico. Sefior Nicolas Ojeda restored many of the specimens. I especially thank Dr. Howel Williams of the De- partment of Geological Sciences of the University of California who has devoted long hours to a petrographic study of Chupicuaro sherd material and whose very pertinent comments are included at the end of this report. The fossils were graciously identified by Dr. Donald E. Savage of the Department of Paleontology of the University of California and Dr. Leo 0. Hertlein of the California Academy of Sciences kindly told me what he could about the badly rotted Chupicuaro shells. Recognition of many other kindnesses will be ex- pressed in the text, but to all those who have made this work possible and helped to make it so pleasant a task, I am deeply grateful. M. N. P.

INTRODUCTION In recent years our knowledge of pre-Columbian America has increased so greatly that the general out- lines of cultural development are now understandable. We know that there were two centers of high achieve- ment, the Andean region of South America and that known as Mesoamerica, which consists largely of Mexico and Guatemala, in North America. As more is known of these cultures and their neighbors, our in- terest and curiosity are not only increasingly stimulated, but also greatly widened. No longer is the student con- tent to work merely in terms of a local culture or of one particular area. He strives to interpret his data in the light of their relationship to American culture growth as a whole. How and why did these cultures develop their specific patterns? In what way are they similar to or dissimilar from Old World cultures? Can there be any connec- tion between the two hemispheres or are the similarities due to something inherent in culture growth? The stu- dent wants to know the determining factors that make a culture assume its particular pattern. What is origi- nal, how much is borrowed and from where? The answers to these questions will help us understand not only growth of New World civilizations but will have a bearing on the greater problem of cultural develop- ment and change. Here we shall be concerned with Mesoamerican civilization, the most complex of pre-Columbian North America. Upon their arrival in the sixteenth century, the Spaniards found a culture in Mexico which was at the same time highly religious and barbarous. The Mayan civilization led intellectually with its intricate calendar, based upon an astonishing knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, involving the invention and application of the zero. In central Mexico, the Aztecs' bloody cult of human sacrifice attracted far more attention at first than their highly developed social system, law, government, commerce, education, crafts, and building programs. The all-important factor was religion, permeating every aspect of Aztec life, which eventually led to a military theocracy. Undoubtedly more is known about the Aztec of cen- tral Mexico and the Maya of Yucat'an than other groups because of direct contact with the Spaniards, but archaeology has revealed that the whole of Mesoamerica shared certain features such as maize agriculture, grind- ing of corn mixed, with ash or lime, a market system, stepped pyramids, ball courts, a fifty-two-year calendric cycle, human sacrifice, high value of jade, use of ear and lip plugs, polished obsidian and pyrite mirrors, to name only a few of the most outstanding elements. As research progressed, backwards in time, a series of earlier cultures was found to underlie the more recent ones and it is now apparent that the basic Mesoamerican pattern was already firmly established by the year A.D. 300 or perhaps even earlier. The very beginnings are as yet unknown. The first clearly defined period is known as the Formative, antedating A.D. 300. By that time people practiced agriculture and lived a sedentary life, made pottery, and understood weaving. Already many features characteristic of Mesoamerica were pres- ent, and remained unchanged through subsequent pe- riods. An interesting clue to the understanding of New World developments is the now recognized fact that the older the cultures under consideration, the more similar they seem to have been. This is certainly true in Meso- america. There, during the Formative, life was simpler and more generalized than in subsequent periods, when regionalism and specialization set in. Thereafter each area developed its own local pattern and never again are the likenesses so great. One might argue that this is illogical, that as commerce, transportation, and special- ization of crafts increase, together with conquest and more complex governments, frequent contacts between peoples would tend to break down regional differences and unite cultures more closely than ever before. This was not the case in Mesoamerica. It is now generally believed that one widespread Formative culture ex- tended from Mesoamerica to the Andean region, in- cluding the intervening areas. The role of this Forma- tive period is all important for an understanding of later cultural developments. In the present paper we shall be dealing with a manifestation of the Formative of west Mexico. This region never assumed the lead in Mesoamerica, but neither did it lag far behind. It shares the basic features of contemporary Mesoamerican life, with dis- tinctive local developments. Archaeologically the area is best known through the work of Isabel T. Kelly and Gordon F. Ekholm. Most known data correspond to Toltec and Aztec horizons in central Mexico, but it must be emphasized that to date only scattered sites have been excavated and the region is very imperfectly understood. Until the work at Chupicuaro was done, little informa- tion was available on the west Mexican Formative period. Although considered a west Mexican site, the prox- imity of Chupicuaro to the Valley of Mexico should be kept in mind. Probably not the place of origin of Formative culture, still the Valley was admittedly an important center at this time, and the general sequence of events there is one of the best known archaeologically, which makes it of considerable value in making com- parisons. Important too is the location of Chupicuaro on the Lerma River, one of the major waterways of the country. It is an area almost destined to have had con- siderable influence on east-west movement of culture. The pages that follow tell of archaeological investiga- tions at this site. Digging was concentrated on a par-</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] INTRODUCTION 519 ticular hill which yielded a wealth of graves, most richly stocked with pottery vessels, figurines, and jewelry destined for use in the after-life by the dead. Through study of the burial customs and mortuary offerings, an attempt at the reconstruction of Chupi- cuarefio history and life can now be made. The contribution of Chupicuaro to the history of the area is really twofold. First of all, it has yielded an enormous amount of material, largely from graves. Secondly, Chupicuaro reveals evidence of the transition from the Formative to the Classic period, a change dur- ing which the fundamental pattern of Mesoamerica be- came firmly entrenched. The chronology of Chupicuaro is greatly clarified, and no longer will it drift about as something vaguely Formative or sometimes "Tarascan." Just as Chupicuaro can now be understood in terms of its relationship to the Valley of Mexico sequence, so it is hoped that it may in turn aid in throwing light on the chronological problems of its neighbors. There is much pick and shovel work to be done in west Mexico before the sequence of events can be clearly defined, but each site investigated closes one more gap in our knowledge of Mesoamerican culture history. The Lerma River is one of the great drainage sys- tems of Mexico, rising in the southern part of the Toluca Valley in the State of Mexico at an altitude of 8,761 feet, whence it flows westward 452 kilometers to Lake Chapala in Jalisco and from there continues as the Santiago River to empty into the Pacific Ocean near San Blas. The river winds out of the Valley of Toluca at the northwest corner, then turns southwestward to form the boundary between the States of Queretaro and Michoac'an. Thence it enters the State of Guana- juato near the town of Tarandacuao and winds crook- edly across the Valley of Acambaro until it reaches the town of that name. Above the town, the river is joined by a small tributary, the Rio Tigre or Coroneo; pre- cisely at the confluence lay the former village of Chupicuaro. See maps 1, 2, and 3. A new Chupicuaro was built in 1949, only four kil- ometers from Ac'ambaro, because of completion of the Solis Dam, seven kilometers above Acambaro on the Lerma River. The artificial lake created by the dam is flooding the abandoned village now known as Chupi- cuaro Viejo. This submerging area was the site of our archaeological excavations and is the Chupicuaro to which I will hereafter refer. The Ac'ambaro Valley begins approximately at Ta- randacuao and extends westward beyond Ac'ambaro. It has a very irregular surface. Acambaro is situated in one noteworthy depression on the skirts of the Cerro del Toro and at the base of the Cerro de la Campana.

Chupicuaro and environs. Shaded areas show geographical extension of Chupicuaro complex. Numerous small ranches are located in other low parts of the Valley such as Puriantzicuaro, La Estanzuelita, El Tejocote, Paso de Ovejas, El Tornero, San Juan, and San Jose. Haciendas include San Jose, Santa Ines, La Encarnacion, and San Miguel. The only villages of relative importance are Puroagua, Jerecuaro, and Chupicuaro. Elevations rise abruptly from the valley floor such as the hills of Iracuao, San Cayetano, Agua Caliente, and the Cerro de la Campana near Acambaro. CLIMATE The altitude of Chupicuaro is approximately that of the Solis Dam, six thousand feet above sea level. The climate is temperate except in higher points of the drain- age basin where it can become very cold. Jerecuaro, the most important town near Acambaro, a few kilo- meters east of Chupicuaro, registers a mean annual temperature of sixty-four degrees, maximum of eighty- nine degrees and a minimum of thirty-three degrees. Chupicuaro is arid with low scrub growth along the rivers. The days are hot; nights are always cool, and at times very cold. Rains usually start in June and last until September, but not infrequently begin in April or continue until October. The average annual precipitation at Ac'am- baro has been recorded as 936.3 mm. GEOLOGY In its long course, the Lerma River crosses a series of wide valleys, some of which may have been former drainage basins cut off by the accumulation of sedi- ments, volcanic sands and ashes carriedi in by wind and water. Not all the valleys were cut-off drainage basins, but some may appear so because of obstacles and bar- riers laid across the river's natural path, perhaps by volcanic action. This, in the opinion of Sefior Alvarez Carvajal, is probably what occurred in the Chupi- cuaro Valley (Alvarez Carvajal, 1943: 12). Rocks of the area consist largely of andesite, rhyolite and basalt. A long east-west hill of rhyolite runs along the west side of the Rio Tigre or Coroneo, just opposite the village of Chupicuaro. The surface of the ground shows many outcroppings of a soft, whitish colored volcanic ash containing abun- dant diatomite. The geological report on the Upper Lerma River submitted to the Comision Nacional de Irrigacion by Se-nor Alvarez Carvajal, stresses the irregular layers</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] INTRODUCTION 521 of the valley floor, showing the interruption of strata by underground displacements. In the study of the Valley of Toxi, also traversed by the Lerma River, Enrique Diaz Lozano notes layers containing fossil re- mains, besides the volcanic ash and sand, pumice and diatomite deposits. This is of interest because of fossils found underlying the burials at Chupicuaro. HISTORY The Chupicuaro region has never been historically significant in the past, nor is it an area of great im- portance today. In pre-Columbian times it was located on the fringes of the Tarascan Empire, whose focal point lay around Lake P'atzcuaro. West (1948) does not include Chupicuaro in the area of Tarascan speech and Stanislawski (1944: 6) traces the Tarascan frontier through Ac'ambaro to the shores of Lake Cuitzeo. Brand (1943: 47), however, says that there is strong archaeological, linguistic and traditional evidence for a Tarascan conquest and colonization in the southern Pame region, that is, from Acambaro and Jerecuaro to Amealco and Apaseo. Although at one time this area may have been conquered by the Tarascans, it was probably not long held and can best be considered an Otomi wedge between the Tarascans on the west and the Mexicans on the east. Fray Alonso Ponce reports (1873: 1: 517) that Ac'ambaro was settled by Otomis near the end of the sixteenth century and says it was part Tarascan and part Otomi. The Relacion de don Nicol'as Montafies de San Luis (Jimenez Moreno, 1944: 9) says that Acambaro was founded between 1526 and 1528 by Otomis from Jilotepec who had been fighting with Guamare Indians. This settlement may have had some connection with those Cortes referred to in his letter in 1526 in which he describes the Chichimec people as barbarous and ignorant. Actually the Tarascans showed little interest in their northern frontier, for that was the region of the Gran Chichimeca and there is no record of conflict between the two groups. During the sixteenth century, the vast area north of the Tarascans was used for cattle-raising (Stanislawski, 1944: 61). The encomenderos took up land and estab- lished large cattle ranches including a few sheep. At first there was no opposition to the Spanish expansion, but in the last half of the sixteenth century, the Chichi- mecs protested against pressure on their hunting and farming lands by sporadic raids. Finally the Spaniards arrived at an agreement with the Chichimecs, feeding and clothing them in return for aid against further re- bellions (Basalenque, 1886, 1: 420). Towards the end of the sixteenth century, cattle-rais- ing was replaced by food production, chiefly of cereals, corn, wheat, and beans. This was especially true of the area around Salamanca, known as the Baj io, which was extremely fertile and productive during the Colonial Period. It lies west of Chupicuaro and Ac'ambaro, and had formerly been occupied by the Guamares, another Otomi group. During the great mining booms in Guanajuato and Zacatecas this area continued to flourish. Today, Chupicuaro and surrounding area are thor- oughly mestizo, Spanish is spoken exclusively, and only European clothes are worn. Acambaro is the larg- est town and serves as a main railroad communication center linking Mexico City with Guadalajara, Morelia, P'atzcuaro, and Uruapan. Ac'ambaro can also be reached today by car from Morelia over an unpaved country road. A local bus runs once a day from Acambaro to Jerecuaro, passing through new Chupi- cuaro. The abandoned island town can be seen best from Munguia, a rancheria on the northern bank of the Lerma River. Chupicuaro Viejo belonged to the Mu- nicipality of Jerecuaro and according to the 1940 census had 1,004 inhabitants. The 1950 census, taken in the new Chupicuaro, recorded a population of 1,189. To- day people subsist on their small portions of land where they raise corn and wheat and obtain occasional sea- sonal work on roads or government projects. There is no craft or industry in the town. Several young men have traveled to the United States as braseros (sea- sonal workmen). ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Chupicuaro first appears as an archaeological site on the Mapa Arqueologica de la Repu'blica for 1926. This recognition resulted from frequent discoveries of small clay artifacts by local inhabitants. In February, 1926, Enrique Juan Palacios was sent out by the Direccion de Arqueologia to visit the area. He reported ancient remains on the hills east and south of Chupicuaro and noted tepetate,1 sand and chalky ash deposits. His conclusion was that the cultural remains were Tarascan (Mena and Aguirre, 1927: 55). Ramon Mena and Porfirio Aguirre were then sent out by the same institution to conduct a small explora- tion. They reported in 1927 that the area was formerly a necropolis. They uncovered three stone-bordered burials, of which two were extended and one was in a broken olla. A building to the east of town was de- scribed as having convex walls faced with river stones, resembling a conical mound of the Cuicuilco type. They collected pottery and figurines and diagnosed the site as Tarascan (Mena and Aguirre, 1927: 59). For the next eighteen years archaeologists devoted their interests to other parts of Mexico and Chupicuaro attracted only local attention. But plowing and fresh rains constantly exposed new surfaces, clay figurine fragments, brightly colored vessels and at times whole burials. These aroused the enthusiasm of Sefior don Camarino Espino, a well-known doctor of Acambaro, and he encouraged his neighbors to bring their dis- 1 Tepetate is a volcanic formation of compact, yellowish sub- stance.</page><page sequence="9">522 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. coveries to him for purchase, thus starting one of the most extensive collections of Chupicuaro material. Dr. Espino began to devote his free time to roaming over the surrounding region, asking questions and gathering data on local finds. His collection rapidly increased to several thousand specimens. News of this archaeological wealth reached Dr. Rubin de la Borbolla, who at that moment was devoting con- siderable time to Tarascan archaeology around Lake P'atzcuaro. In June of 1945, Dr. Borbolla, Srta. Elma Estrada Balmori, Sr. Jorge Obregon de la Parra, and the author spent a few weeks in Acambaro, becoming familiar with the enormous collection of Dr. Espino and benefiting greatly from lengthy conversations with him. For several weeks we stayed in Ac'ambaro and drove every day to Chupicuaro. We dug eleven pits, uncovering three burials and a representative lot of sherds. The results of our work have been reported (Estrada and Porter, 1945) as the first season of field work at Chupicuaro. No outstanding conclusions, were reached but the following facts were made clear: (1) there were no large structures, nor did we find evidence of any pyramidal monument such as that of Cuicuilco; (2) all indications suggested that the plain black-brown wares occurred together with the two-color and painted polychromes; (3) the material could all be classed as Preclassic or Formative with the notable exception of two handled incense burners, typical of the Mixteca Culture (Estrada and Porter, 1945: fig. 19). These pieces were found at the shallow depth of .50 meter and undoubtedly were intrusive specimens imported at a much later date and therefore bear no direct relationship to the local Chupicuaro material. In 1945 the Solis Dam project was already well under way and as we passed the dam site every day we were constantly reminded of the urgent necessity for large scale excavation at Chupicuaro. Dr. Borbolla wasted no time in making the necessary arrangements. The following year a group of three, Srta. Estrada, Sr. Rom'an Pifia Chan, and the author, then students at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, began the second field season of work under the direction of Dr. Rubin de la Borbolla and the auspices of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. The project, financed by the Direcci6n de Arqueologia of the Insti- tuto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, also bene- fited materially from the invaluable cooperation of the Comision Nacional de Irrigacion which provided twenty local workmen from the Solis Dam Project. The In- stituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia rented a house in Chupicuaro to serve as living quarters and office. The group remained in the village from March, 1946 until the work terminated in January, 1947. Srta. Estrada was placed in charge, since increasing demands in Mexico made it impossible for Dr. Borbolla to be with us constantly. I remained in Chupicuaro only the first six months. Later in the year, Srta. Estrada returned to Mexico City and during the re- maining six weeks Pifia Ch'an carried on alone. In 1947 I made two trips from Morelia to Chupicuaro, moving all the crated material to the regional museum in Morelia, where it was stored until 1950 when every- thing was taken to Mexico City. During these three years each member of the party had become engrossed in other affairs so that prospects of studying the Chupi- cuaro material looked dim. I was hesitant about pre- paring the manuscript alone, since I had been present only during the first half of the excavations and already considerable time had elapsed. I undertook the job, however, because the material itself merited attention and because of the obvious disadvantages and dangers of continued postponement of the study. Dr. Borbolla graciously put all the material at my disposal and my colleagues provided me with their notes and other data. The excavations, be it emphasized, were a group project; the following presentation and interpretation of facts are wholly mine. In the removal of material from Chupicuaro to Morelia and thence to Mexico City, the case containing the stone metates, manos, and stone balls mysteriously disappeared. With this exception, the collection is re- ported in full. All the Chupicuaro vessels and artifacts here dis- cussed are in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia in Mexico City with the exception of several outstanding pieces on loan. THE PROBLEM The enormous private collection of Dr. Espino, an almost equally large collection of purchased and donated Chupicuaro specimens in the Museo Nacional in Mexico City and in the regional museum in Morelia, together with numerous pieces known to exist in museums in the United States, indicated that the remains found near Chupicuaro were not a thin veneer or the acci- dental caches of a migratory people, but represented a well-developed local culture. West Mexico is known archaeologically only in patches. Greatest credit for what is on record un- disputedly goes to Isabel Kelly who has examined more of the region than any other archaeologist, conducted numerous excavations, made surface collections and, for a period of about fifteen years, devoted almost all her time to West Mexican archaeology. Scattered sites through Jalisco, Culiacan, and Sinaloa have been ably studied by Kelly and G. F. Ekholm. In addition, a full report by Kelly is available on Apatzingan in the hot country of Michoaclan. A few articles have been pub- lished covering excavations at Tzintzuntzan on Lake PTatzcuaro (Caso, Acosta, and Rubin de la Borbolla), although considerable later work remains unreported. Dr. Noguera (1943) worked around Zamora and Jiquil- pan and Moedano (1946) published a preliminary note on the pottery of Zinapecuaro, Michoac'an. Practically nothing is yet known archaeologically concerning the</page><page sequence="10">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] EXCAVATIONS 523 region east and north of Chupicuaro in the State of Guanajuato. Fortunately, new impetus was given to West Mexican archaeology in 1946, when a Round Table Discussion focussed attention on its problems. Excavations were then under way in Chupicuaro and a small exhibition of recent finds was presented. Much attention was drawn to the potential significance of the Chupicuaro site, but it was still too early to arrive at definite con- clusions. Three papers were presented (Rubin de la Borbolla, 1948; Estrada Balmori and Pifia Ch'an, 1948; and Porter, 1948a); subsequently Srta. Estrada pub- lished another article (Estrada Balmori, 1949). As a result of the discussion at the Round Table, I became impressed by the apparent isolation of Chupi- cuaro in relation to other archaeological sites in West Mexico. Kelly has tried wherever possible to suggest links and cross-ties between areas known archaeo- logically, but Chupicuaro is too old and too distant to have any direct connection with her sites. Far too often the excavations of Kelly and Ekholm in Culiacan and Sinaloa are accepted as representing "the situation" in West Mexico, even though both have been careful to point out that their sites could not be used to charac- terize so vast a region. This was made clear at the Round Table meeting in 1946, when all the known facts of West Mexican archaeology were brought to- gether and the serious gaps in our knowledge of many areas became apparent. The summary of the Round Table meeting presented by Armillas (1948) shows fourteen archaeological prov- inces in West Mexico, of which Number 9, called Lerma Medio, includes Chupicuaro. Its closest neighbors are the provinces of Tzintzuntzan and Zamora. These may now be considered. It was generally agreed that the term Tarascan, formerly applied loosely to almost all archaeological finds from West Mexico, should henceforth refer only to that late complex from the Lake Patzcuaro area represented by the Tzintzuntzan material. Briefly, it is characterized by the following elements: copper bells, tweezers, axes, chisels and ornaments, a small amount of gold work; ceramic features: elaborate negative painting, stirrup handles, spouts, tripods, abundant miniature vessels, short and long-stemmed pipes with or without two supports. Clearly these criteria ruled out Chupicuaro as a Tarascan site, for it presents none of them, but belongs to the Preclassic or Formative cultural epoch. In brief, the two complexes are sepa- rated by almost a thousand years. So Chupicuaro, although adjacent to the Tarascan area, is far removed in time. The Zamora province is less well known but has produced a variety of remains. El Opefio, reported by Noguera in 1943, yielded tombs containing objects pre- sumably older than any yet uncovered in West Mexico: an "Olmec" style green stone figure, two jade earplugs, notched obsidian points and a few vessels, one of which is negative painted (Noguera, 1943: fig. 7a). In spite of the last of these finds, El Opefio is considered equivalent to the Zacatenco horizon (Noguera, 1949: 38 and Armillas, 1948: 76). Other excavations in Los Gatos in the Valley of Zamora by Plancarte yielded considerably younger material classed by Noguera as belonging to the Toltec Horizon (Noguera, 1948: 38). Numerous isolated and sporadic finds, together with purchased specimens from this general area, are in the Museo Nacional in Mexico City. I recently re-ex- amined all the material available from West Mexico, including the El Opefio specimens, for any evidence of contact with the Chupicuaro area, but could find none. In general, Chupicuaro seems to have been com- pletely isolated from its neighboring archaeological provinces; when distance does not account for this, time does. At the outset, I suspected that Chupicuaro might represent another regional development with few af- filiations with its western neighbors, but many questions and problems arose. If Chupicuaro was not Tarascan, what was it? Could cultural connections be found with the nearby area of Zinapecuaro, Michoacan? Was all the Chupicuaro material contemporaneous or was any time depth apparent? What of earlier or later cultures in the same region; what happened before and after the flourishing of the culture we call Chupicuaro? How closely can Chupicuaro be tied with the Valley of Mexico sequence and where does Chupicuaro stand in relation to the broader aspects of Mesoamerican culture history? The pages that follow do not answer all these questions; indeed, not only do many problems remain unsolved but new ones have been raised. The overall pattern in this region still remains dim, but gradually regional developments and a chronological framework are beginning to emerge. Here then is a report on an archaeological site in an area whose cultural past has been hitherto almost un- known, a site strategically located on the Lerma River linking central highland Mexico with the west. II. EXCAVATIONS The village of Chupicuaro Viejo stretched along the crest of a hill precisely at the confluence of the Lerma and Tigre or Coroneo Rivers (map 3). This hill was one of many small rolling elevations in the long valley leading to Acambaro, Guanajuato. The 1945 excavations centered in the plaza of the village, which occupied the highest point of the hill. Other pits were dug on various slopes east of town across the Rio Tigre. These served to acquaint us with the area and prepare for more extensive work. The second field season opened at the end of March, 1946, with twenty local workmen employed by the Solis Dam Project. The first few days were spent in recon- naissance of the region on foot and horseback, observing</page><page sequence="11">524 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the distribution of remains and collecting surface sherds. It soon became apparent that hilltops had served as living sites. Almost without exception the crests of the rolling hills were littered with sherds, fragments of ob- sidian and bone artifacts. The valleys and lower slopes were almost devoid of archaeological remains and the small amount of material found there had probably washed down from above. Sherds on the slopes were badly weathered, but presented the same waresi as those found on the hilltops. The previous excavations had uncovered both black and painted pottery. The black ware types shared cer- tain forms with Preclassic pottery in the Valley of Mexico, but the painted types were quite distinctive. We hoped to locate a site yielding either black or painted sherds exclusively, thereby providing a lead as to possible archaeological time-depth in the region. In the immediate Chupicuaro area we found that both types occurred together and seemed to be in almost equal proportions. If, as is often the case, painted wares are ceremonial and plain undecorated pottery utilitarian, one may expect a greater percentage of the latter. Since this was not so, we suspected that the Chupicuaro potters had not worked with this specializa- tion in mind. Geographically the Chupicuaro complex extends over a considerable area of the southern part of the State of Guanajuato. The southern and western limits are fairly well defined. The typical pottery has been found all along the boundary of the States of Guanajuato and Michoacan, dipping into Michoacan as far as the south- ern shore of Lake Cuitzeo. The abundant archaeologi- cal remains of Zinapecuaro, Michoacan, however, are of more recent date and cannot be related at the present time to Chupicuaro. This latter pottery has been found as far southeast as Maravatio, and northwest to Salva- tierra (map 2). We know less of the northern and eastern limits of the complex, but it does extend beyond Jerecuaro. The greatest concentration of remains seems to be along the Lerma River around Chupicuaro, but by no means are all vestiges of the culture obliterated by the newly created lake.

The location of the following sites is shown on map 3. EL PANTEON The first series of tests was made in a cornfield known as El Panteon, south of the Chupicuaro plaza, behind the church. Eight pits, averaging 2 by 3 meters, were dug to a depth of .75 or .80 meter, where sterile tepetate was reached. No graves were found, nor were sherds abundant at any point. 7W @ E |LA JOYITA z Thirteen more pits were made at three different levels in a terrain known as La Joyita. This lay approxi- z &lt; mately two kilometers southeast of the village across 0 the Rio Tigre or Coroneo (map 3). Nine pits were dug on the hillside and four on the river banks. Our &gt; wn attempts to find a stratigraphic sequence were in vain although the sterile tepetate was not reached for 2 meters. Sherds were few and occurred only in the top layers. Two dog skeletons were found at a depth ccil of 1.40 meters in Pit 25. Remains of carbon and a few unworked stones lay nearby, but it could not be deter- mined whether or not the dogs were interred by man. EL RAYO Wl Southeast of Chupicuaro and just southwest of La Joyita, is a long, irregular hill limited on the west by W31:I1l1 + t the Coroneo River and on the south and east by the Lerma.

The area of greatest concentration of remains is shown on map 3 as El Rayo proper (central circle). Adjacent terrain to the south, Potrero Trujillo, yielded sixty-five graves; north of El Rayo only eight were found. MUNGUIA This is a small rancheria north of Chupicuaro on the road to Jerecuaro (map 2). On the outskirts of the settlement a trench was dug 12 meters long by 1.50 meters wide. Sterile soil was reached at a depth of 2 meters. Only an urn burial and three isolated or float- ing vessels were found. EL INFIERNITO Southeast of Chupicuaro on the opposite side of the Lerma River, nine test pits were dug on a hilltop facing El Rayo (map 3). This land was known as El In- fiernito. The hilltop was littered with sherds, but the pits yielded only one burial. METHOD OF EXCAVATION Pits were dug to obtain material which we hoped would yield a satisfactory stratigraphic sequence, as stratigraphy has proved itself to be one of the best archaeological methods for observing changes in culture history. Unfortunately, by no means does the archae- ologist often find his material neatly arranged in con- veniently stratified middens. In the Chupicuaro area sherds were abundant on the surface but we found no accumulation of rubbish. Nevertheless, except where a pit was being widened, layers were always carefully stripped off in thicknesses of twenty-five or forty centi- meters, depending on the abundance of material. Dig- ging was not easy because the hard terrain made prog- ress slow. Screening was ineffective because of the hard clods of earth and adobe-like texture of the soil. All material had to be carefully picked over by hand at the side of each pit. After sterile soil was reached, each was refilled. Considerable obsidian, bone, sherds, figurine frag- ments and fire-hardened bits of clay floors were col- lected and labeled according to depth. As graves in- creased in number it became evident that the crest of the El Rayo hill had been a cemetery. Burials were scattered throughout the terrain, singly or in groups usually without stone markers or grave limitations of any kind. The fact, however, that burials were found at different levels, frequently directly over one another, indicated that the area must have been used for inter- ments over considerable length of time. The excavation of each pit was continued until sterile soil was reached, usually at a depth of approximately two meters. Arrival at either tepetate or gravel an- nounced the end of cultural remains. In several cases, we dug through the gravel to the tepetate, finding fossil remains of Pleistocene animals. Pits were begun in 2 by 3 meter dimensions, but often were enlarged as burials appeared. The largest and most rewarding excavation was that of Pit 33, which yielded forty-seven graves. This was started as a 2 by 3 meter pit and later extended to 13 meters in length by 9 meters at one end and 8 at the other. Begun at the north, this pit was dug to a depth of about 1.70 meters. The immediate appearance of six burials indicated a great concentration of graves. The excavation was then greatly enlarged and systematically stripped to a depth of 2.42 meters, at which point gravel appeared. Digging continued through the gravel in a 2-meter strip at the southern end but yielded no cultural or fossil remains. As the gravel disappeared at the depth of 2.83 meters, tepetate took its place. Excava- tions continued for .65 meter before the pit was filled in. Next in importance were Pits 41 and 81 (plan 1). III. STONE ALIGNMENTS No true structures were found, but lines of rows of stones were not infrequent. Some of these are seen in the plans of Pits 33 and 40 (plans 3 and 4). The stones in Pit 33 were at a depth of 1.70 meters, but seem to have had no relation to the burials. Grave 34 was limited by stones along the right side, but this was a unique case. The most complex stone alignment was that of Pit 40 (plan 3). The excavation of this pit was extended to form two trenches approximately 12 and 9 meters long in order to follow the stones, which appeared at a depth of 1.50 meters and extended in roughly parallel rows about 30 to 45 cm. apart. These were not walls, but single orderly rows of round stones (fig. 1, d, f). The plan does not suggest any practical purpose such as marking off rooms or living quarters. However, these stones are evidence of some kind of planning. Three scattered burials were found in this pit. Two were below the stones and one above. The clay hearth or tlecuil No. 20 lay .60 meter below the stones and only .50 meter from a grave. The two may have been contemporaneous. We cannot place these burials chron- ologically as they presented no diagnostic traits. The skeletons were of children, each accompanied by one vessel as an offering. Pit 59, located roughly midway between Pits 33 and 40, contained a row of irregular stones running from north to south. Although the four burials in this pit were not directly associated with the stones, all but one disturbed grave were located west of them. Grave 102, of indeterminate date, was found at the very shallow depth of .25 meter. The rest are Early. Below Burial 102 was Cache 4, pertaining to the Late Phase. The neatest example of construction work was in Pits 112, 113, and 114 (plan 1).

These sealed a hollow trench, probably a kind of drain, which sloped off the hill. It was .24 meter deep, limited by two rounded stones on either side. The top was covered with two rows of neatly fitted slabs of rock, DRAIN Pit aia 1313, TOP VIW PROFIL CROSS SECTION making a horizontal lid. The top averaged about .60 meter in width. This drain continued for a distance of 8.50 meters, at which point it stopped abruptly. Burials were found either at the same depth as the drain or below it. One grave belongs to the Early Phase. In Pit 114 no burials were found, but the presence of four isolated vessels may mean that the area was disturbed. Any attempt to date the alignments would be purely speculative. However, if the drain was interrupted to bury the dead, it must have been constructed during or prior to the Early Phase. IV. TLECUILES Forty-four clay receptacles, known as tiecuiles, were found.2 These are depressions in the earth lined with packed clay where fires were built. Most tlecuiles were rectangular or square, but six were basin-shaped. All were broader at the rim than base, varying from .25 to .60 meter square by about .30 meter in depth. They always contained fine ash and cinders. Preservation was impossible as the tlecuil promptly crumbled as soon as the surrounding earth was disturbed (fig. 1, g). These curious receptacles must have had some func- tion relating to the disposal of the dead. Distribution does not follow any consistent pattern. Tlecuiles oc- curred individually or in groups of two or three. Al- though some were quite isolated from graves, frequently these seem to encircle a tlecuil. Burials were not neatly arranged, but as can be observed in the plan of Pit 33, plan 4, the tlecuil seems to form a focal point around which graves were scattered. Since the tlecuil was often situated above the grave, it must have been made after the dead had been interred. As it is unlikely that large groups of burials were made simultaneously, a tlecuil could have been used repeatedly. This would 2 The word for tlecuil probably comes from tlecuilli, a Nahuatl word for hearth. (Maria Teresa Fernandez de Miranda, verbal information.)</page><page sequence="15">528 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. have been feasible in those instances where the tlecuil was at a considerably higher elevation, thus serving as a central marker for placing graves. Since, all were filled with fine ash and cinders, it is tempting to suggest that a ceremonial fire formed part of the funeral services. This seems to be the most likely explanation for their presence. In most cases it is impossible to determine the chron- ological phase in which the tlecuiles were built. Ap- parently interments were made on this hilltop over a considerable period of time and since the majority of tlecuiles lay above the burials, it is very difficult to as- sign these to phases. However, where a tlecuil or group of these was surrounded by graves of a particular phase, it is reasonable to assume that the tlecuil was made at the same time. In this way, seven were probably Early and eight may be considered Late. The remainder were either completely isolated or in pits containing graves of both phases. Of the oval tlecuiles, two are Late, four of indeterminate date. It is evident from the above that tlecuiles were used during the time these graves were made. In cases where a tlecuil lay directly over a grave, the grave proved to be Late. This custom, together with oc- currence of oval-shaped tlecuiles in such positions, may be a hint that there was a change in burial practices during the Late Phase. A detailed description of the tlecuiles, their exact location, pit, depth, and relation to burials, is on file and may be consulted in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia in Mexico City. V. BURIALS The field season yielded a total of 390 burials, 46 dog skeletons and a group of a few charred remains re- ferred to as the ossuary. These together with the abundant associated artifacts constitute the bulk of the material presented in this report.

In order to present these data in a way most ad- vantageous to the reader, they have been arranged ac- cording to type of artifact. Thus, all the pottery is described and discussed as a lot regardless of whether it was found in a grave, a cache, or as a floating object. The same is true of figurines, obsidian, shell and bone and stone artifacts. Therefore, this chapter will be limited to the presentation of data concerning burial customs, types, distribution, and chronology. The lat- ter is based largely on the type of associated artifact and will be treated more fully in chapters to follow. The skeletal material has not yet been studied. Prob- ably few skeletons are well enough preserved for ade- quate study. On the whole the condition of the bones was poor. Many skeletons had badly disintegrated, as can be seen in the photographs (figs. 2 and 3). The soil was hard and lumpy, making excavation very dif- ficult. Once removed from the ground, the bones were brushed clean and packed at the field house. At present they are still packed, but time and travel have un- doubtedly not bettered the condition of specimens poorly preserved at the start. THE OSSUARY Charred remains of human and animal bones found in Pit 37 were the only evidence of cremation at Chupi- cuaro. Pit 37 was located east of the main center of burials (plan 1). The charred bits of bone began to appear at a depth of .25 meter and continued to .75 meter. This stratum was full of unworked pieces of obsidian with great quantities of ash and human bones in fragments not exceeding 5 centimeters in length. All the bones were completely burned. The obsidian gradu- ally diminished in quantity and disappeared about .80</page><page sequence="17">530 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. meter from the surface. The deposit contained no potsherds. At a depth of .80 meter the pit w4s enlarged and digging was continued to 2.50 meters, but no further traces of the ossuary were found. Two dogs lay im- mediately beneath the cremated bones at .80 meter. Three bone rasps were recovered .20 meter below the dogs. These were made from human femurs having a round perforation at one end (fig. 22, z'). The pit was filled in at 2.50 meters where the sterile soil gave way to tepetate. This small area of charred bones is unique at Chupi- cuaro, but the quantity of ash shows intentional crema- tion. Absence of sherds makes it impossible to relate these remains to those of other pits. Cremation was certainly not the customary method for disposal of the dead. LOCATION OF BURIALS All but 2 of the 390 burials were found along the crest of the hill southeast of town, in the land known as El Rayo. Of the 109 pits and 8 trenches dug there, 46 pits and 5 trenches yielded little material and no graves. In the others, burials were found singly, in small groups or large concentrations. In some areas the graves were so close together as well as superim- posed, that it was not always easy to judge which bodies had been interred together and which were buried at a later date. Interments were made from .25 meter to 2.50 meters in depth. The tepetate or gravel often determined the maximum depth. Our observations in the field show that the burials included those of men, women, and children. Many of the complete skulls were artificially deformed fronto- occipitally. This can only be reported as a field ob- servation. A glance at the plan of Pit 33 gives a good idea of the burial pattern (plan 4). Interments often encircled a tlecuil, which as a rule was located at a higher level. Little attention was paid to orientation or posture, al- 165 161 __ -178 0 &gt; ~~~~~~~~~i~60 TLICUIL 22 159 171 PLAN 6 PIT 82 SO</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] BURIALS 531 215 =X) 213 A4 : &lt; ? atd ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~207 214 2 210 220 ccl ~~219 - 21 B 7 Q 205S~lD l o (R) eTLECUIL 37 143 O LCUIL 35 204 20620 TLtCUIL 56 PLAN 7 PIT 87 though the burial was carefully made, often with con- siderable goods. Stones were seldom used as markers. This distribution of burials around tlecuiles applies to the great concentrations of graves. Those in smaller groups or individual graves follow no particular pattern of interment. Two graves were found at other sites. Grave 388 was in Trench 7, at Munguia, a small rancheria north of Chupicuaro. The other site, El Infiernito, was lo- cated southeast of town across the Lerma River (map 3). Of the nine pits dug there, one yielded Burial 87. BURIAL TYPES Five types of burials were found at Chupicuaro. They are as follows: TABLE 1 Direct primary burials 283 Fragmentary or disturbed burials 51 Secondary burials 4 Urn burials 2 Skull burials 50 Total 390 Each will briefly be considered. DIRECT PRIMARY BURIALS This is simple interment, the most common method comprising 73 per cent of all graves. The location of skeletons does not suggest any con- sistent pattern of orientation but the extended position was preferred. The variety and frequency of positions are as follows: TABLE 2 Extended 261 on back 245 on right side 3 on left side 1 on face side 12 261 Flexed 22 on back 14 on right side 2 on left side 6 22 Total 283 FRAGMENTARY OR DISTURBED GRAVES This group, numbering fifty-one in all, consists of burials which may have been made as direct primary interments, but which were found in such poor preserva- tion, or were so incomplete, that a more exact classifica- tion is impossible. It has already been observed that the general condition of the skeletons at Chupicuaro was poor. Sometimes only traces of bones were found. In other instances, the condition of the skeleton sug-</page><page sequence="19">532 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

Since the general area must have been used as a cemetery for a considerable period, it is likely that burials were often disturbed to make room for others. Although it is impossible to be entirely accurate about this group, I believe thirty-seven to be fragmentary and fourteen disturbed. SECONDARY BURIALS Four have been considered secondary, that is, the body had been left to decompose in the air, and later the bones were gathered and interred. It is not always easy to distinguish a secondary burial from a frag- mentary one. Only those have been considered sec- ondary whose bones were in a position virtually im- possible for an articulated skeleton. In these four the bones seem to have been heaped in a pile, including the skull. One consisted only of fragments of long bones, ribs, and pieces of the skull. These were painted red. The painting of bones after desiccation of the body was a common custom in Mesoamerica (Hrdlika, 1901: 721) but this is the only instance found at Chuplcuaro. The three accompanying vessels are pots common in the area and there is no basis for considering the grave intrusive. Since this is a unique case, one wonders if perhaps the bones were colored accidentally by the disintegration of a textile in which they had been wrapped. The other secondary graves present no unusual features. URN BURIAL Two infants were found in large ollas.3 These were the only urn burials and must be considered atypical, since 131 other children were buried in the same manner as adults. Both urns were badly broken. The ollas were plain black ware and neither these nor other as- sociated vessels presented any unusual feature. One was found in Pit 90, in the main group of El Rayo pits (plan 1), the other at Munguia (map 3). SKULL BURIAL A curious custom among the Chupicuarefios, and by no means a rare one, was the interment of the skull alone. Fifty burials of this type were found. These included skulls of both sexes, adults and children. 3 The term olla as used in this paper refers to a globular jar with a restricted opening and slightly flaring neck.</page><page sequence="20">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] BURIALS 533 One might wonder whether these skulls could repre- sent further evidence of disturbed graves, or since bones were generally so poorly preserved, whether the rest of the skeleton had not disintegrated. Both suggestions could be valid in some cases; the latter is an especially tempting hypothesis since many of the skulls were of children. However, even if preservation is very poor, one nearly always finds some trace of bones. The most durable parts of the human skeleton are the long bones, and the absence of any trace of the body in fifty cases dispels any doubt concerning the existence of skull burial. The fact that many of these skulls were found at the deepest level argues against subsequent dis- turbance. Skull burials have been reported from numerous parts of Mesoamerica. It is interesting to note whether these burials include mandible, atlas, and axis, or consist exclusively of the skull proper. In the first case, the presence of the mandible, atlas, and axis indicates de- capitation. The latter suggests a type of secondary burial, the skull having been cleaned and later interred. At Chupicuaro, both customs existed. The field notes record skull burials both with and without the lower jaw. Decapitated skulls predominate. Of skull burials, eighteen were adult, thirty-one were children and one grave yielded two skulls, those of an adult and child. Some children's graves included several skulls: three were with Burial 93, six with Burial 114, two with Burial 176, four with Burial 186 and two with Burial 265. That the skull was held in special esteem is borne out by other data. The skull of Burial 275, an ex- tended skeleton, had been neatly severed just above the ears. Noteworthy too were seventeen skeletons which N ~~~~~~PLAN9 PIT 112 CACHE 11 271 IDOG 42 (A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A= I"* 268 \I</page><page sequence="21">534 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. lacked a skull, but were otherwise intact. In several such cases the bones were in excellent preservation. Three most unusual graves had the lower jaw, but lacked the skull. All were extended on the back, but one had the lower legs flexed to the pelvis. These graves were direct primary interments and the skull must have been removed subsequent to burial. It may be significant that none were found with offerings ex- cept Burial 89, which had a shell tucked under the chin. Burial 89 might have been disturbed to inter Burial 88. The knees of the latter were located close to the jaw bone of Burial 89 and only .12 meter deeper. Neither grave can be dated. In the case of Burial 31, the nearest interment lies .50 meter from where the skull should have been and is slightly deeper. It is not impossible that the skull was removed when Burial 30 was in- terred, but the distance involved makes this less proba- ble than in the former case. Again, neither can be dated. The third skeleton was situated at a greater depth than any of its neighbors, and no plausible explanation presents itself for the missing skull. Trophy skulls were also placed as offerings with the dead. Both whole skulls and neatly cut brain cases were found. These are discussed here to complete the data on skull treatment. Seven whole skulls accompanied six graves. They were usually well preserved and placed on or near the knees of the skeleton. Only one was that of a child. Two of the graves were Early, the rest Late. Eight other skulls had been horizontally severed and only the brain case used. Three of these are so frag- mented that restoration was impossible. The others were examined by Sra. Johanna Faulhaber of the De- partment of Physical Anthropology of the Museo Na- cional de Arqueologia of Mexico. Her observations show that probably every skull had artificial occipital deformation. Four cut skulls were stacked on the knees of the skeleton of Burial 25. One, slightly deformed, is of a woman fifty-five to sixty years of age. It had been painted red. Lateral perforations probably existed near the rim but these portions were missing. Another deformed cut skull was that of a woman aged forty to forty-five. One right parietal had a round hole near the rim, drilled from the exterior. The other specimens were similarly cut, and one of an adolescent showed lateral rim holes. The fourth belonged to an adult aged forty to forty-five. It was poorly preserved (fig. 26-j, k). Burial 212 yielded a single cut skull, deformed, painted red, with lateral perforations near the parietal rims. This was of a man about thirty to thirty-five. Skull burials have been frequently reported in the literature, from Zacapu (Lumholtz and Hrdlicka, 1898: 63) and Tzintzuntzan (Rubin de la Borbolla, 1939: 108-109) in the Tarascan area and from Guasave, Sinaloa (Ekholm, 1942: 43). Elsewhere in Meso- america, finds include Teotihuacan II and Mazapan Phase of Teotihuacan (Armillas, 1950: 45 and 59), the Matlatzinca Culture (Garcia Payon, 1941: 65), the Mixteca (Caso, 1938: 42), Xoxo, Oaxaca (Saville, 1899: 358, 361), Upper Tres Zapotes (Drucker, 1943: 110, 148), and the Maya area (Kidder, 1947: 57). Cut skulls are less common, occurring at Uaxactu'n (Kidder, 1947: 57) and Cerro de las Mesas (Drucker, 1943a: 77), where the facial portions only were pre- served, presumably to serve as backing for a human face in the first instance. The only direct references to skulls cut horizontally as at Chupicuaro are from Teotihuac'an. Thirty-five skulls and one cut brain case placed on top of a skull were found in a cave 300 meters west of a new fork in the highway to Otumba (Armillas, 1950: 59). Associated pottery was of Teotihuacan II date. Armillas also told me he recalls finding such cut skulls in refuse deposits at Teotihuacan although these cannot be placed chronologically. Hrdlicka (1903: 433) reports a piece of human skull with artificial perfora- tions from Juchipila, Zacatecas. Kidder (Kidder, Jenn- ings and Shook, 1946: 154) shows how preoccupation with death and the skull as an art motif permeate Mesoamerican culture in many phases. Chupicuaro people concentrated heavily on trimming skulls and decapitating victims, at least more so than any other contemporaneous central Mexican people. In this regard, Chupicuaro shows a closer relationship to Teotihuac'an than to Ticom'an sites, where skulls were not tampered with. Since there is no evidence of large-scale warfare in Mesoamerica until post-Classic times, and there is nothing in Chupicuaro culture suggestive of a bellicose people, one wonders whether these practices did not deal with some religious concept, rather than treatment of an enemy. In any event, the head played a significant role in the death cult of the Chupicuarefios. OFFERINGS The majority of burials were accompanied by some article, most frequently pottery. Of the 390 graves, only 71 were unaccompanied by some artifact. In every type burial, graves with offerings exceeded those without. Thirty burials had offerings of ten objects or more.

SOC. eight, the largest offering uncovered. This was a multiple skull grave. It is curious that skull graves were often the most richly stocked. Of the eight richest graves, all were skull burials except two in which the dead had been extended. This suggests that decapita- tion was not dishonorable. Besides pottery, off erings included trophy skulls, obsidian points, manos and metates, figurines, earplugs, shell ornaments, beads and necklaces, bone tools, ocari- nas, rattles and whistles. As might be expected, the adults received most of the earplugs, metates, and manos. Children were given nearly all the necklaces and beads as well as all the musical instruments. Figurines were equally distributed among adults and children. A single figurine might be found near any part of the skeleton, but groups were placed in a vessel. The only large hollow figurine was held in a child's left arm (fig. 19, r-t). Figurine burial is in itself an interesting custom. In Central Mexico, figurines accompanied Tlatilco, Xalostoc, and Gualupita graves, but Vaillant did not find them in Zacatenco and El Arbolillo. The three former sites seem to represent a cultural tradition other than that represented at Zacatenco and Ticomtan (Porter, 1953). In order to study the placement of offerings at Chupicuaro, only undisturbed and relatively intact bur- ials are considered. This eliminates fragmentary, sec- ondary, disturbed, skull graves, and urn burials. Of the 232 remaining graves, offerings were placed at the head in 52, in 57 at the feet, in 39 at both head and feet and in 84 cases the offerings were scattered about the body, often near the chest or along the trunk. This does not indicate a consistent pattern. Chronologically there is little difference in location of offerings. The following table records the distribu- tion of offerings with extended and flexed burials. Offerings seem to have been more evenly distributed in the Early Phase than in the Late, although many graves cannot be placed chronologically.

In the field we believed that the graves belonged to one chronological period. We observed differences in figurine types and were aware of certain new forms in pottery, but could not discern any marked differences between the burials. In general these field observations have proved valid. However, on studying the material in the laboratory, the distribution and association of some types of pottery and figurines do indicate a change and I believe this of sufficient importance to warrant a division of the great period of Chupicuaro into three phases: Early, Transitional, and Late. There are several ways of detecting chronological change in a series of burials: there may be a shift in the type or postures of interment; the terrain may show a climatic change sealing off older graves from more recent ones; or the associated objects may indicate significant differences in cultural tastes. We found no stratigraphic evidence in burial arrangement. At Chupicuaro there is little difference in positions and type of burial, although the extended, ventral inter- ment occurs more frequently in the Late Phase. This would not have been apparent, however, from a study of postures alone. The terrain itself offered no clue, as the same area was used as a cemetery during the entire period. Fortunately the abundantly stocked graves furnished a wealth of material, the study of which made clear some interesting and unsuspected cultural differences. First, it was noted that the two major figurine types were not found together in graves. Then it was ob- served that the slant-eye figurine accompanied black polychrome or black-and-red pottery, while choker figurines occurred almost exclusively with brown poly- chrome and brown-on-red pottery. This furnished the basis for a segregation of material into two lots. The former group was considered Early and the latter, Late. The reasons for this will be made clearer in the discus- sion of figurine types. Graves that yielded elements of both were considered Transitional. Next, the plan of each pit was studied in the light of these groupings. A burial adjacent to or touching an Early Phase grave at the same depth was undoubtedly made contemporaneously, so it could be added to the Early group. In this way it was possible to place still more graves chronologically. Unfortunately all graves could not be allotted to one of these groups as the criterion for classification was not always present. I speak of Early, Transitional, and Late Phases, but it should be kept in mind that this is a relatively minor breakdown of a long single period. Many types and forms of pottery remain virtually unchanged through all three and were it not for the substitution of brown paint for black and the radical change in figurines, these phases could perhaps not have been distinguished. Of the 390 graves, 227 have been assigned to a phase: 143 being Early, 11 Transitional, and 73 Late. The remaining 163 present no diagnostic chronological fea- tures. Two of these were urn burials.</page><page sequence="24">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] ISOLATED OR FLOATING VESSELS 537 TABLE 5 CHRONOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE OF BURIAL TYPE Early Trans.

Late graves were very scarce here but increased in the surrounding area, especially towards the south, where the hill tapers down to a point around which bends the Lerma River. Burial customs underwent no great change. The same variety of types and postures are found through- out with minor differences. Detailed information on each burial is available at the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Mexico, D.F. DOG BURIALS Skeletal remains believed to belong to forty-nine dogs were found scattered through the El Rayo cemetery site. These were probably independent interments, although in a few cases a dog may have been asso- ciated with a human grave. Six skeletons were ac- companied by offerings showing that dogs were some- times interred with special attention. Dogs were found in twenty-five pits, all but one in the El Rayo cemetery. The exception was Pit 25, on the bank of El Tigre River at the site known as La Joyita. The forty-seven dogs from El Rayo were found in pits mixed with human burials. Most of the dogs cannot be allotted to one of the three chronological phases but two were definitely Early and two Late in date. Offerings with dogs included obsidian, figurines, pottery vessels, worked sherds and part of a human femur, cut and perforated (fig. 12-k; 21-i', n', o'; 23-j, 1, u, v; 26-g). Handsome pottery dogs from Colima are so out- standing that one often associates the dog with West Mexican archaeology. Historical records tell of the common belief that dogs assisted the deceased in the afterworld in overcoming the necessary trials in a kind of purgatory (Torquemada, 1723: 2: 522). Three pottery dogs were found as isolated or floating objects but none with Chupicuaro graves. The distribution of aboriginal dog burials in Meso- america is very inadequately known. Little or no at- tention has been devoted to this subject, and a dog skeleton may be easily confused with that of a coyote. Dogs were buried carefully at Zinapecuaro where two were found covered by a pottery vessel (Moedano, 1946: 43). More than twenty skeletons believed to be of dogs were found at Tlatilco. The Vaillants un- covered a vessel at Azcapotzalco containing a dog with- out the skull. This was probably a Teotihuacan II date (Armillas, 1950: 61). I am indebted to Javier Romero for the information that dog skeletons have been found at Monte Alban, in the late remains at Cho- lula, near the cathedral of Mexico City, and possibly at Tula, Hidalgo. Charnay (1887: 148) tells of vessels containing dogs in Teotihuacan tombs. Bunches of animal bones of small carnivorous animals were asso- ciated with Burial 2 at Tenayuca (Noguera, 1935a; 164, 170). Kidder (Kidder, Jennings and Shook, 1946:155) discusses finds of dog teeth, skeletons and a jaw ramus, the latter from Uaxactumn. As the outstanding domesticated animal in pre- Hispanic Mesoamerica, it is to be expected that the dog would be highly esteemed. Probably the custom of interring dogs was much more widespread than the above listing indicates. The earliest record of this custom to date is that at Tlatilco, from which time the practice seems to have persisted up to the Conquest. VI. CACHES Groups of vessels, figurines, or other objects found together as though intentionally buried, but not asso- ciated with skeletal remains, have been classified as caches. Fourteen such finds were made. Of these, ten were located in the central part of El Rayo hill and four were slightly to the south. Two were associated with deer or bird bones and three may have accompanied burials which were sub- sequently disturbed. The remaining ones, however, were too isolated to have formed part of any grave offering. It is not known why these caches were made. The objects found in caches are discussed in the larger sections dealing with pottery, bone, shell, and stone, and many have been illustrated. A detailed description of each cache can be found in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Mexico City. Of the fourteen caches, eight belong to the Early Phase, three are Late, and three cannot be placed. The objects themselves do not differ essentially from those associated with the graves. VII. ISOLATED OR FLOATING VESSELS Isolated or floating vessels totaled 158. These were scattered at random in the pits on El Rayo hill. Most were entire, and, although some may have belonged to offerings from disturbed graves, this does not seem a likely explanation for so many. Table 6 shows the type wares represented in this lot.</page><page sequence="25">538 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.

Most of these vessels have the same form and decoration as those from graves. Six unusual speci- mens merit special attention. Three effigy vessels represent dogs. Two are nearly identical. One illustrated (fig. 7, a-b) has hollow body, only vent is slot mouth, head simply modeled, erect ears, bowed legs, stubby feet, toes indicated by incisions, back supports large funnel-shaped receptacle. Phase indeterminate in both cases. The reclining dog (fig. 9, t) is kidney-shaped, protrusions simulate legs; head rises above rim, beautifully modeled face. Vessel is orange in color. Modeling shows unusual degree of realism as compared with conventionalized forms char- acteristic of Chupicuaro ceramics. Possibly trade ware. Phase uncertain. Ring-shaped human effigy vessel (fig. 12, m-o) unique in shape and decoration. Body thick and tire- shaped; cylindrical spout forms mouth; broad face unlike figurines or other effigy vessels. Decoration by both incising and painting. Probably import. Late Phase. Elongated effigy tripod vessel terminating in two rim heads (fig. 7, k) is unique in shape but entirely within Chupicuaro ceramic tradition. Early or Transi- tional. A tall cylindrical red-on-buff jar has no parallel in collection (fig. 10, i). Walls slope gently outward, neck narrow, vertical appliqued strips decorate walls, painted with cross motif occurring only in Late Phase. VIII. POTTERY Chupicuaro pottery is abundantly represented in col- lections of the Museo Nacional of Mexico, regional museums in Morelia and Guanajuato, besides many pieces known to exist in private hands. This paper is based only on specimens obtained in the 1946 explora- tions because these excavations provided a large sample of material for which there is a detailed record of provenience. The following pottery analysis is based on 1,305 com- plete or nearly complete specimens, of which 1,080 were associated with graves, 67 in caches or with dogs, and 158 isolated or floating. The study was greatly facilitated by being able to work with complete specimens rather than fragments. Forms and decorations could be studied and compari- sons made without running the inevitable risks involved when dealing with sherds. Another factor simplifying classification was the standardization of Chupicuaro ceramics. Unusual sherds attracted attention and were saved, but by the end of the season nearly all could be TABLE 7 POTTERY CLASSIFICATION Total Burials Caches Isolated BLACK WARE (1) Rim Shoulder (a) Cylinders plain 18 14 2 2 rimless 8 5 2 1 ovals 4 4 1 0 others 2 2 0 0 (b) Bowls 21 19 0 2 (2) Body Shoulder (a) Jars 69 53 5 11 (b) Ovals 5 4 0 1 (c) Tall necks 6 6 0 0 (d) Tripods 11 9 1 1 (3) Basal Shoulder (a) Bowls and jars 23 22 1 0 (b) Tripods flared rim and basal angle 72 55 2 15 concave wall 28 21 1 6 (4) Bowls with short flaring necks (a) Plain bowls 37 31 2 4 (b) Tripods 14 13 0 1 (5) Tecomates4 (a) Bowls 19 16 2 1 (b) Tripods 11 9 0 2 (6) Plain open bowls 14 13 0 1 (7) Ollas 92 75 3 14 (8) Miscellaneous tripods (a) Spider-legs 8 7 0 1 (b) Open bowls with mammiform feet 4 3 0 1 (c) Others 7 5 1 1 (9) Ring Stand 12 9 3 0 (10) Pedestal Base 3 3 0 0 (11) Shoe-Shapes 5 4 0 1 (12) Effigy Vessels 28 21 1 6 Total 521 422 27 72 4 The term tecomate as used in this paper refers to a spherical vessel with restricted opening, incurved rim, no collar.</page><page sequence="26">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 19561 POTTERY 539 TABLE 7-Continued Total Burials Caches Isloated PAINTED WARES 784 Red-Rimmed (1) Ollas 4 3 0 1 (2) Tecomates 27 23 3 1 (3) Bowls 7 5 1 1 (4) Shoe-Shapes 5 3 2 0 (5) Pedestal Base 1 1 0 0 Total 44 35 6 3 Red Ware (1) Ollas 6 5 1 0 (2) Tecomates 21 19 1 1 (3) Bowls (a) Plain open 12 8 1 3 (b) Ovals and heart- shapes 13 10 0 3 (4) Tripods (a) Spider-legs 34 24 1 9 (b) Others 14 11 1 2 (5) Pedestal Bases 2 1 0 1 (6) Effigy Vessels 12 9 0 3 Total 114 87 5 22 Black and Red (1) Ollas 1 1 0 0 (2) Cylinders 5 4 1 0 (3) Tecomates 2 2 0 0 (4) Tripods 7 7 0 0 (5) Pedestal Bases 1 1 0 0 (6) Effigy Vessels 1 1 0 0 Total 17 16 1 0 Brown-on-Red (1) Tecomates 2 2 0 0 Total 2 2 Red-on-Buff (1) Ollas 34 31 1 2 (2) Open Bowls 63 53 1 9 (3) Rimmed Bowls 14 11 0 3 (4) Ovals and Canoes 26 23 0 3 (5) Ring Vessel 1 1 0 0 (6) Tecomates 18 16 1 1 (7) Tripods (a) Spider-legs 140 122 2 16 (b) Others 34 23 5 6 (8) Pedestal Bases 4 3 0 1 (9) Effigy Vessels 14 11 2 1 Total 348 294 12 42 Black Polychrome (1) Ollas 6 3 3 0 (2) Bowls (a) Plain open 54 48 2 4 (b) Tecomates 12 12 0 0 (c) Deep bowls 7 6 0 1 (d) Rimmed bowls 6 3 0 3 (e) Bowls with basal shoulder 10 9 0 1 (f) Ovals and kidney shapes 13 13 0 0 TABLE 7-Continued Total Burials Caches Isolated Black Polychrome-Continued (3) Tripods (a) Spider-legs 8 8 0 0 (b) Straight or concave sided 6 4 1 1 (c) Globular tripod 28 23 4 1 (d) Oval and kidney shaped tripods 4 3 1 dog 0 (e) Unusual support 4 4 0 0 (4) Tetrapods 4 3 0 1 (5) Pedestal Bases 17 14 3 0 (6) Shoe-Shapes 1 1 0 0 (7) Effigy Vessels 29 27 1 1 Total 209 181 15 13 Brown Polychrome (1) Ollas 3 1 1 1 (2) Rimmed Jars 6 5 0 1 (3) Open Bowls 19 17 0 1 (4) Tecomates 6 6 0 0 (5) Oval Bowls 5 4 0 0 (6) Tripods 6 5 0 1 (7) Effigy Vessels 5 5 0 0 Total 50 43 1 6 identified with specimens found with burials. The few aberrant types are illustrated (fig. 22, a-k). Chupicuaro pottery is heavy, thick-walled, and very durable, a fact borne out by the large number of com- plete specimens recovered. It is handmade. Paste is uniform, brown in color, and extremely coarse. Pottery was fired at a very moderate temperature. The tempering of Chupicuaro sherds has been ana- lyzed by Dr. Howel Williams, who found that this too was uniform, consisting of rhyolitic or dactic volcanic ash. Basaltic or andesitic ash is absent, a surprising fact in view of the abundance of such ejecta in the region. There is apparently no correlation between the coarseness and composition of the tempers on one hand and the thickness and designs of the sherds on the other. The important point is that all the Chupi- cuaro pottery is quite homogeneous as to clay ingredient and the same mixture of clay and tempering materials was used for both black and painted pottery. Just as one type clay was used throughout, so stand- ardization is evident in other aspects. Design is wholly geometric, whether incised or painted, and the same motifs are repeated in a variety of combinations. Ves- sel shapes are also highly standardized. Pottery falls into two main categories: black and painted. These will be described according to the classification given in table 7. BLACK WARE Under black ware, I have included all pottery devoid of paint, thus comprising 521 specimens. Of these, 422 were found in graves. Fifty-eight burials were ac-</page><page sequence="27">540 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. companied by black ware exclusively, whereas in 153 others, black pottery was mixed with painted wares. Twenty-seven black vessels were in caches and 72 isolated or floating. Black and painted wares are both heavy. Many un- painted specimens are so elegant and decorative in form that I have purposely avoided using the term utilitarian to describe this group. Indeed one cannot be at all sure that at this time in Mesoamerica, people had reached the sophisticated level of distinguishing everyday from ceremonial ware. Approximately two-thirds of the black ware speci- mens have no secondary decoration. Once the vessel was modeled, no adornments were added. The re- maining third show additional decoration, either by incising, engraving, or filleting. Design is always geometric and motifs very simple. Because secondary decoration is of minor importance, classification of this group is based almost exclusively on form. With few exceptions to be noted below, all speci- mens are unslipped. Usually black ware specimens have been smoothed and have a dull polish. Long strokes of the polishing tool are often evident. On very few specimens a high polish has been achieved, but the lustrous finish of the painted ware is never found. In color, most specimens vary from brown to black. Some were intentionally fired a buff color and others a deep black. Few vessels are uniform in color, firing clouds being common. Shape, size, and decoration will be described under each type. Distribution of each type as found in burials, caches or as isolated specimens is listed in table 7: only the total is repeated here. Measurements of il- lustrated vessels are found in figure explanations. (1) Rim Shoulder (a) Cylinders Plain (fig. 4, a, c): 18.

Discussion Black ware constitutes slightly less than half the pottery in the Chupicuaro series. This lot came from burials, caches, and isolated finds. In many ways, black ware forms a very homogeneous lot. Color may vary from buff to black, but few vessels are evenly fired and most present a mottled appear- ance. The smooth dull polish is quite uniform. Deco- ration consists of very simple geometric designs usually con-fined to a shoulder or rim. In black ware, form is more important than decoration. Relying on beauty of shape for aesthetic appeal, the potter experimented with several types of vessels to which she could add sup- ports, or a flaring rim for variation. The olla, a form common to nearly every Mexican culture, is not particularly outstanding at Chupicuaro. Handles have been added in many cases and the body was sometimes elaborated by modeling the wall in a series of terraces or steps. Plain open bowls and tecomates are basic forms. The body of many vessels was broken by a sharp angle or shoulder near the rim, toward the center or at the base. The sharp shoulder is outstandingly charac- teristic of black ware both in cylindrical and globular shapes. Nearly every vessel form has an oval or elon- gated variant, besides occurring with or without tripod supports. Some of the oval shapes are especially at- tractive. Ring-stands and pedestal bases have pleasing propor- tions and certain specimens such as the vessel from Burial 166 (fig. 6-1) are unusually handsome. In effigy vessels the potter abandoned some of the standardized forms to portray animals and birds. Ani- mals were represented by appending tabs to one of the common forms, an exception being the dog effigies, which show an unusual attempt to model the body. These are curious but crude specimens. On the whole, standardization of form and decoration was rigidly adhered to and deviations from the basic pattern occurred but rarely. Most black ware forms were retained throughout the entire Chupicuaro period. A study of black ware alone would not have led to discernment of three chronological phases. But once these were distinguished on the basis of figurines and painted ware types, then it was pos- sible to sort out black ware forms as given in table 8. Even though Early burials far outnumber Late ones, this table indicates that black ware was much more popular in the Early Phase. Tripod vessels tend to decline in importance in Late times; pedestal bases and TABLE 8 CHRONOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK WARE TYPES Early Transi- Late (1) Rim Shoulders (a) Cylinders Plain 11 0 1 Rimless 4 1 0 Ovals 2 1 1 Others 2 0 0 (b) Bowls 8 2 1 (2) Body Shoulders (a) Jars 37 3 5 (b) Ovals 2 0 0 (c) Tall necks 4 0 0 (d) Tripods 6 1 2 (3) Basal Shoulders (a) Bowls and jars 12 1 1 (b) Tripods Flared rim and basal angle 34 1 2 Concave wall 12 0 1 (4) Bowls with Short, Flaring Necks (a) Plain bowls 8 3 8 (b) Tripods 7 0 1 (5) Tecomates (a) Bowls 10 1 0 (b) Tripods 3 1 2 (6) Plain Open Bowls 2 0 3 (7) Ollas 27 5 23 (8) Miscellaneous Tripods (a) Spider-legs 3 0 3 (b) Open bowls with mammi- form feet 3 0 0 (c) Others 4 0 1 (9) Ring-Stands 6 0 0 (10) Pedestal Base 2 0 0 (11) Shoe-Shapes 1 0 1 (12) Effigy Vessels 8 0 2 Total 218 20 58</page><page sequence="31">544 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. ring-stands may have disappeared. Ollas continued in an even proportion. Decoration of black ware is limited to simple geo- metric incised designs which show no relationship to other contemporaneous Mesoamerican pottery. The banded and panel-incised decorations in the Valley of Mexico are not similar to Chupicuaro motifs. Some Chupicuaro black ware forms are comparable to those of Valley of Mexico vessels of the periods Middle Zacatenco to Teotihuacan II. The basal- shouldered tripods in particular are similar to forms of Late Ticoman: both share a low angular shoulder and short, conical supports. Similar forms have been re- ported from the Pyramid of the Sun (Noguera, 1935: 64) and from El Tepalcate (Noguera, 1943: 43). But the fancy long leg Ticoman supports have no parallel at Chupicuaro in black ware. Some of the olla forms are generally similar to those of the Valley of Mexico but these are not distinctive enough to be of comparative value. One specimen from Burial 41 is almost indistinguishable from the typical Tlatilco olla with converging incised strokes for decora- tion. This vessel, comparable in size, color, and decora- tion, is the only one of this type found at Chupicuaro. It was associated with an Early Phase burial. The hand-handles of Zacatenco and Ticoman (Vaillant, 1930: pl. I-e; V-b, c; 1931: pl. LXIX-x, z, a', b', d') are unknown at Chupicuaro. Although considered rare, oval-shaped bowls are found in the Valley of Mexico during the Middle Zacatenco Period (Vaillant, 1930: 86). Since these were uncovered at Copilco, this form, along with the pedestal- base and basket handles, belongs more properly to a Late Middle Zacatenco horizon. These simple bowls are not as elaborate as Chupicuaro ovate vessels with rim points terminating in conventionalized heads. Both pedestal bases and ring-stands are found in the Middle Zacatenco Period at Zacatenco and Copilco (Vaillant, 1930: 86-87), although in detail these do not specifically resemble Chupicuaro specimens. Chupi- cuaro pedestal bases are more elaborate, the one from Burial 166 being exceptionally elegant. Vaillant says this form is of little chronological value since it occurs in all periods at Ticoman, Cuicuilco, and is also found at Copilco and Middle Zacatenco (Vaillant, 1931: 384). The ring-stands at Chupicuaro occur only in black ware and present a great variety. In Middle Zacatenco the ring-stand occurs only in decorated wares and on an open bowl form which is unknown in the Chupicuaro collection. The black ring-stand vessel with flaring neck (fig. 6, h) recalls the florero appearing on the Teotihuactan II horizon (Armillas, 1944: 302), al- though the latter does not rest on a stand. Two speci- mens nearly identical to those of Chupicuaro are in the storeroom of the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia in Mexico. One is attributed to Totolapan, Morelos: the other is of unknown provenience. Kidder (Kidder, Jennings and Shook, 1946: 177) discusses these two forms, the pedestal base and ring- stand, and wonders if each one may not have had its own significant cultural development and distribution. The evidence from Central America suggests this. Kidder notes the wide distribution of the ring-stand in Mesoamerica, most examples being from Central Mexico south to Guatemala and in time dating largely from the Classic Period. The earliest occurrence is that already noted in Middle Zacatenco where it was admittedly rare. It then reappears in Teotihuacan II (Armillas, 1944: 302). It is of interest that at Chupicuaro both the ring- stand and pedestal base occur in the Early Phase, roughly equivalent to Ticoman III and Teotihuacan I. Even the datable painted ware specimens are confined to this phase. The continuance of these forms at Chupi- cuaro is doubtful. At least in this area the two forms are not mutually exclusive. Black ware shoe-shapes number only five. This form does not seem to exist elsewhere in Central Mexico at this time. There is little to add on effigy vessels. These were probably locally inspired and largely consist of adding tabs to one of the other forms to portray a bird or animal. The bird forms are not unlike Tlatilco speci- mens from the Valley of Mexico. The most distinctive effigy vessels are the two dogs with a receptacle on the back. Pottery dogs are well known from Colima, but these are probably of more recent origin and certainly show a finer quality of workmanship. In most in- stances the hollow body of West Mexican dogs serves as the receptacle, but this is not true at Chupicuaro. The only comparable specimen reported in the literature is a dog from Colima (Cossio, 1940: 187) which sup- ports a similar funnel-shaped receptacle on his back. PAINTED WARE This group, comprising all specimens which have some painted decoration, numbers 784. Like black ware, these were found with graves, caches and isolated. The paint used was black, brown and red. A thin yellowish slip was usually applied first. Rarely the slip was whitish. Classification has been based on the color combinations, leading to the seven types given in table 9. This method of typology seemed most logical since form, which proved to be the most satisfactory criterion for classifying unpainted wares, is of secondary impor- tance in this group. Shapes are repeated in all painted ware types and a classification based on form would have little value. By segregating pottery according to paint or color combination chronological differences be- came apparent. Use of black paint proved to be diag- nostic of the Early Phase, brown of the Late Phase. In this way the black polychrome and black-and-red specimens are Early while brown polychrome and brown-on-red belong to the Late Phase.

In some cases a high glossy polish was achieved. Burnish- ing strokes are much less apparent than on unpainted specimens. The majority of vessels are slipped with the exception of the red-rimmed type. RED-RIM MED This group contains forty-four vessels decorated with red paint on rims, handles, tabs, and appendages. Color varies. The vessel may be fired a light flesh color or nearly black. Most specimens show considerable wear. Forms include ollas, tecomates, bowls, and shoe-shapes. One vessel with pedestal base was found with Burial 131. No tripods belong to this group. With the pos- sible exception of two or three vessels, this type is un- slipped. Painted areas may be polished to a lustrous red. (1) Ollas (fig. 8, a): 4 Shape globular with convex base, short flaring neck with thickened lip. Two specimens have pair of serv- iceable rim handles.

Carelessly made red cross decorates top of another. (5) Pedestal base (fig. 8, f): 1 Specimen fragmented, base probably conical, recep- tacle with flaring walls, rounded rim. Size: ht. of re- ceptacle 7 cm., diam. orif. 20 cm. Decoration: interior painted red extending out over rim; four pairs rim tabs. Discussion Red-rimmed ware is one of the less significant groups. In form and decoration it is, very simple. The light col- ored vessels are distinctive because of the plain, un- decorated surfaces. The red rims, handles and tabs afford a marked contrast with the smooth, cream- colored background. The only decorative motif is the red hand. Nearly half the specimens are tecomates with very restricted neck and two or more handles. With one exception (fig. 14, n) the shoe-shapes are the only painted ware examples of this form.

Decoration limited to red paint and modeling. Dog effigy is orange with black eyes. Discussion The 114 specimens of red ware show considerable variety of form, including the most common Chupicuaro types. Paint often covers the entire or greater portion of exterior surface. As a rule this is highly polished. The color may vary from a light orange to a rich deep red. There are only five orange-colored specimens. Paint, on the whole, is quite uniform. Since decoration consists of solid red fields, elabora- tion is limited to slight variations in form, the addition of bosses, rim points and filleting. The high polish in many cases is striking. Some of the most handsome pieces belong to this group in which simplicity of line is emphasized by a lustrous finsh, rarely marred by uneven firing. Red ware seems to have occurred throughout the various Chupicuaro phases with some chronological changes noted in form and color. Most orange speci- mens are from Late Phase burials. Sixty-two speci- mens can be chronologically placed on the basis of asso- ciated material.

The red ware tripod from Burial 275 (fig. 9, 1) is unique and may be intrusive. The light red or orange color resembles that of other specimens occurring only in the Late Phase. The supports are unlike others at Chupicuaro. Although this may be a stranger on the Lerma River, it does not recall ceramics of any other region. The two tripod bowls with fluted trim (fig. 9, i) are unusual. The color tends to orange. These pots may have a western origin, as comparable specimens in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Mexico, are attributed to Jacona and Purepero, Michoacan. Similarity is especially close in color and finish as well as in the peculiar fluted trim. Some of the Michoacan vessels have round loop feet. Unfortunately the specimens in the storeroom cannot be accurately placed chronologi- cally, nor can we be entirely certain of provenience. BLACK-AND-RED Black-and-red pottery is not very significant typologi- cally but since black paint is an Early Phase marker, this small lot of seventeen vessels is of substantial in- terest. With one exception all were found with graves. Forms are as in the polychrome types and decoration is very simple. The technique employed in decorating these speci- mens is complex. The vessel was first slipped in a cream-colored wash. Next red paint was applied cov- ering the entire pot except the design area. After the red paint had dried, the design area was painted black. The impression is that black was used as over-paint on red, but actually both colors have been painted on the cream-colored slip. This laborious method is clearly observed by a close examination of several specimens. Where the black paint has disappeared, a cream-colored slip is revealed. Motifs are simple, frequently consisting of banded tri- angles encircling the vessel. The finish is never lus- trous. (1) Ollas (fig. 10, a): 1.

Discussion There are only seventeen vessels in this group and these may well be simple variations of black polychrome since the technique of decoration is the same. Form is not outstanding. Decoration is relatively simple, con- sisting of plain bands of black paint or triangular motifs. Black paint was confined almost entirely to the Early Phase. Only one tripod vessel is considered to be of Transitional date, since the grave also yielded a choker figurine. All specimens were probably made locally. BROWN-ON-RED Only two vessels were found of this type and these are identical tecomates (fig. 10, g). Here the technique used was over-paint. These were painted red and when dry, a stepped motif was applied on the red. The brown paint is not fugitive and is well preserved. The lines of brown paint feel raised to the touch, something not true of black-and-red vessels where a different tech- nique was involved. The brown-on-red specimens were associated with Burials 191 and 262 and are considered Late because of the use of brown paint. The identical tecomates have very restricted orifices, are slightly depressed. The de- sign is a simple stepped or angular pattern of thin brown lines covering the exterior surface. The vessels were polished before the brown paint had completely dried, thus slightly smearing the lines. Size: B.191: ht. 11 cm., max. diam. 22 cm., diam. orif. 10.5 cm.; B.262: ht. 6.5 cm., max. diam. 14.5 cm., diam. orif. 6.5 cm.; thickness wall .6 cm. Little can be added regarding these specimens. Prob- ably the most noteworthy feature is the simplification of decorative technique occurring during the Late Phase. RED-ON-BUFF Red-on-buff is the most numerous of the painted pot- tery groups, comprising 348 specimens decorated with red paint, either a red motif or a buff design set off by a red background. Slip was often applied prior to painting and varies from cream to yellow. Many decorative motifs are shared with polychrome wares. Red-on-buff patterns are simple. Forms include ollas, open bowls with or without rims, canoe and oval shapes, tecomates, tripods, pedestal bases, and effigy vessels. The spider-leg tripod out- numbers all other red-on-buff forms, attracting atten- tion by its standardization in form and decoration. No tetrapods or ring-stands belong to this group. (1) Ollas (fig. 10, h-o): 34 Shape: twenty vessels, round with restricted necks, rim handles, bases convex, necks short, flaring.

Sup- ports spread more than in other types, sharply pointed. Type D (fig. 11, s): B type with deep square receptacle, supports short, spreading, pointed. One specimen has pointed loop-type support where vents have almost con- verted support into strap. Another has four rounded rim lobes, others are straight or dip between corners.

Ring-shaped vessel has unique decoration of two parallel zig-zag incised lines running from center of tube to base, fields between zig- zags alternate red and buff. Only example of incision and painted decoration combined. Discussion A high polish is still preserved on many specimens in this group. Some show heavy wear, including the spider-leg specimens. Motifs are repeated with slight variation. Many will be found in the section to follow on black polychrome where a thin black line has been added to the red-on- buff type. This modification occurs mostly in the open bowl designs. Standardization of both form and deco- ration is striking. Red-on-buff pottery was common in all phases. However, considering the abundance of Early burials as compared to Late, the following chart might be in- terpreted as suggesting an increase in red-on-buff dur- ing the Late Phase. Certain changes in form are ap- parent during the Late Phase. Red-on-buff pottery is common in Mexico from Tia- tilco times through the Mazapan Horizon' and relation- ships can be made only on the basis of detailed compari- sons of finish, color, motif, and form. So, although this general sort of painted ware has a wide distribution in time and space, the only strictly analogous material I TABLE 12 CHRONOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE OF RED-ON-BUFF WARE Early Transitional Late Ollas 9 3 16 Open bowls 25 7 10 Rimmed bowls 0 2 7 Ovals and canoes 4 0 14 Ring vessel 0 0 0 Tecomates 2 4 7 Tripods (a) Spider-legs A type 33 2 6 B type 20 9 11 C type 5 2 5 D type 0 1 2 (b) Others 14 1 8 Pedestal base 0 0 0 Effigy vessels 7 1 4 Total 119 32 90 have seen is from the Cerro del Tepalcate.5 There I was able to identify sherds of rims and supports of these same types. They are indistinguishable from our com- plete specimens. I believe Chupicuaro products were actually transported to the Valley of Mexico in this case. Chupicuaro types at this site never occurred with burials. Other red-on-buff body sherds show Chupi- cuaro affiliations, but the forms could not always be ascertained. At least two or three Chupicuaro vessels appear in the literature from other areas. Linne illustrates a red- on-buff specimen purchased at Teotihuacan (Linne, 1942: 178, fig. 319). It is a globular tecomate with very restricted neck and short, vertical rim. The geo- metric design is characteristic of Chupicuaro and this piece was probably imported. Batres (1903: pl. 26), illustrates two vessels from La Quemada that also look like Chupicuaro products. The tripod vessel is the typical spider-leg B type in tecomate form (compare with fig. 11, p, q, t). A similar spider-leg form was found at Ticom'an in red ware (Vaillant, 1931: 390- 391) but the tall tripod support is not common in the Valley of Mexico. A curious form is the ring vessel, of which two were found. The smaller was probably made locally, but the large effigy vessel (fig. 12, m, n, o), a floating ob- ject, reflects none of the Chupicuaro characteristics. The human face is unlike that of any other effigy and we have no other example of painted decoration com- bined with incision. The technique is known in Early Ticom'an (Vaillant, 1935: 299) but no comparable forms are reported from that site. 5 Cerro del Tepalcate, also called Loma del Tepalcate, should not be confused with another archaeological site known simply as El Tepalcate. The former is a recently excavated hilltop site west of Tlatilco (see Pifia Chan, Romano P. and Pareyon M., 1952). The latter is a site on the east side of the lake near Texcoco.</page><page sequence="38">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] POTTERY 551 Ring-shaped vessels are rare in Mexico. An effigy ring vessel is illustrated by Lumholtz (1902: 2: 333) from Zapotillic, Jalisco. Another one was purchased by Juan Valenzuela at Buena Vista in the Municipality of Paso de Ovejas, about fifty kilometers from Vera- cruz, and is now in Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Mexico. This is a simple ring with two round rimmed orifices. The body is slipped red. Purchased in the same lot were basal angled bowls with concave sides and two spouted effigy vessels resembling Monte Alb'an I types. The entire lot of material is probably of For- mative date. It is said to have been found at the base of a local archaeological structure at a depth of twelve meters. BLACK POLYCHROME This group includes 209 specimens of which 181 were with graves, 1 with a dog burial, 14 in offerings and 13 isolated or floating. Any specimen that combined red and black paint with the buff base color to make the design, has been included in this group. Sometimes the use of black paint is limited to a simple circumferential line or two. Although there appears to be considerable variety of form, in reality there are only a few basic types to which may be added a short rim, tripod supports or a modeled face. The plain bowls show remarkable stand- ardization and are the most numerous shape. Ring- stands do not occur, but there is a surprising number of pedestal bases. Several of these are effigy vessels. The four Chupicuaro tetrapods belong to this group. Decoration shows a complexity of design requiring careful planning of space and proportions, together with a facility for combining the same motifs in a variety of ways. A simple motif may be repeated on different forms, and used in new combinations of patterns. The plain open bowls resemble red-on-buff ware in design and shape, but on pedestal bases, spider-legs, tripods with concave or straight walls, and bowls with basal shoulder, a very special polychrome decoration is found. Almost the entire vessel is painted red as background for the design. Only very small portions of the buff base are exposed and these are carefully outlined in black, making a strikingly handsome decoration. This is the special red variant. Motifs are diamonds, stepped and zig-zag patterns, cross-hatching, bands and outlining. A few vessels show simple curvilinear designs, but these are rare. Owing to the number of illustrations included and standardization of designs, I shall not attempt to de- scribe decorations in detail. I will call attention to outstanding or unique motifs only. Two vessels not discussed below, and the only speci- mens illustrated not found in our excavations, belong to the collection of the regional museum in Morelia, Mi- choacan. These have been illustrated because of their unique forms (fig. 12, s and fig. 14, a). Unquestion- ably from the Chupicuaro region, both are black poly- chrome. The stirrup-spout is not common in Meso- america but has been found in the Valley of Mexico at Tlatilco and Late Zacatenco, from Vera Cruz and Playa de los Muertos, Honduras (Porter, 1953: 27, 40, 49, 62, 66), sites antedating Chupicuaro. At a much later date, it occurs frequently at Tzintzuntzan on Lake Patz- cuaro (Rubin de la Borbolla, 1948a: 29). I know of no other vessel similar to the tripod specimen.

Decoration: representative group illustrated. Mo- tifs same as in above types, only unusual feature is addi- tion of head or face, features modeled, gouged or painted. Discussion Numerically, black polychrome second only to red- on-buff among painted types. This group has great- est variety of form and decoration of painted wares and includes the only tetrapods. There are several different styles of decoration. Many plain bowls share motifs with red-on-buff types, only distinction being addition of black lines. An en- tirely different style presented by special red variant. Solid red paint covers vessel with exception of small stepped motifs in buff outlined in black. This unique style easily recognized (fig. 13, e, g, n, o; fig. 14, d, g, h, o, p). These fifty-three vessels form a homogeneous group. Another style, represented by ten vessels, con- sists of red striped motifs outlined in black (fig. 12, r, x). Seven others share a decoration of cross-hatch- ing in panels (fig. 13, m; fig. 14, n). The black-winged motif occurs on eleven vessels (fig. 13, s, t, x; fig. 14, 1). A nearly unique running diamond design is found on six others (fig. 14, i, k, i). Fifteen polychrome vessels are decorated in panels and may have small scroll designs (fig. 13, p, q). Many remaining speci- mens resemble red-on-buff pottery in design and war- rant no special comment. Use of black paint is diagnostic of the Early Phase. Only twenty vessels of black polychrome occurred in Transitional burials. The various polychrome styles or motifs noted above may prove to have chronological implications, but these are not yet discernible on the basis of present data. Sherds of the red polychrome variant have been found at Cerro del Tepalcate in the Valley of Mexico, a Late Ticoman site (Pifia Chan, Romano and Pareyon, 1952: 12-13).6 The other polychrome decorations are quite unique in Mesoamerica. This polychrome style, being easily recognized and distinguished from other Mesoamerican painted ware groups, may prove useful in tracing exterior relation- ships. At present, however, with the exception of the Cerro del Tepalcate, it is limited to the Chupicuaro re- gion, suggesting local development. BROWN POLYCHROME This group of fifty vessels is considered a poly- chrome because the base color, buff, is always used as a design element in combination with red and brown paint, giving the effect of three-color decoration. Forty- three vessels were in graves, one in a cache and six were isolated. Red paint dominates, and brown is used for outlin- ing, filling in by cross-hatching or making stripes. The dark chocolate brown in a few cases is replaced by a very dark red. Vessels were first slipped in a yellow- ish wash, then decorated with red and finally brown paint. In form, bowls with restricted mouth predominate; those with very small orifice were classified as teco- 6 Actual specimens examined in Museo Nacional de Arqueo- logia, M&amp;xico, D.F.</page><page sequence="41">554 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. mates, the others as open bowls. Other forms include ollas, spider-leg tripods and effigy vessels. Design, always geometric, includes diamonds, stepped designs, zig-zags, and stripes. This group is small, but is very significant chrono- logically. Brown polychrome is more recent than black and occurs simultaneously with choker figurines and trade specimens of the Late Phase.

Decoration: same as above, only unusual feature is modeling or painting head or face. Discussion The fifty-vessel sample of brown polychrome is small compared to some of the other types, yet large enough to give a fair range of form and decoration. Forms are not unusual, but include no pedestal bases or tetrapods. Tripods are outnumbered by bowls. Some motifs of black polychrome vessels are repeated, but in general decoration is more simple. The field of red is greatly reduced as compared to black polychrome, exposing more of the buff base color. Brown was the last color added. One can often see where it runs over the red at the beginning of a stroke. The larger buff area made it easier to add brown motifs which were made with thicker lines than when black was used. Brown polychrome was not carelessly made, but these motifs required less patience and precision than the former type. Designs are bolder, less intricate, and could have been made with considerable rapidity. Brown polychrome is a Late Phase marker. Thir- teen specimens were associated with Transitional bur- ials. Vaillant illustrates a trade sherd at Ticom'an with red and chocolate brown decoration on buff. But on another page he says it is red and black on buff (Vail- lant, 1931: 290, 387). The motif is the common stepped pattern found on Chupicuaro red-on-buff and both polychromes. However, the sherd resembles the brown type with bold strokes rather than the finer lined black polychrome. Brown polychrome sherds indistinguishable from Chupicuaro ones have been found at the Cerro del Tepalcate in the Valley of Mexico. The Chupicuaro-</page><page sequence="42">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] POTTERY 555 like sherds were in debris not with graves. To date this pottery has not been reported elsewhere. DISCUSSION OF POTTERY TYPES One of the striking features of Chupicuaro pottery is the dichotomy of painted and black ware types. What comparisons can be made between these groups? Are certain forms limited to one type, or are particular dec- orations confined to certain painted wares? What mo- tifs are most common and do any carry through all painted types? And how do all these factors reflect the chronological change so emphasized in figurine types? Of the 1,305 vessels, 521 are black ware, 784 painted. It is interesting that painted vessels outnumber the black in graves, caches, and isolated -finds, as well as in sherd collections. In form, black and painted wares share the olla, tecomate, plain bowl, shoe-shape, pedestal base, and effigy vessels. Black ware forms are dominated by a sharp angular shoulder located either at the rim, in the body, or at the base. In addition to shoulders and exaggerated rim points, some vessels had horizontal channelling. Others are ornamented by incising, fillet- ing or fluting. Incised designs are always very simple geometric motifs such as groups of short, parallel lines. The most common is a wide V closed by a row of tiny incisions. Filleting was less popular but was sometimes used for decorating rims with groups of small flat pellets. The shoulder was usually the design area. In- cised motifs were located near the rim. The shoulder is virtually absent in painted ware with the exception of sixteen black polychrome vessels. The ring-stand is an exclusive feature of black ware. Painted vessels have curved bodies; globular shapes which replace the sharp angles of black ware. There is less variety of shape. This is understandable since ornamentation is based on painted motifs rather than form. Only two shapes are confined to painted wares. One is the tetrapod, which occurs in black polychrome of which there are four. The other is the spider-leg tripod, a highly characteristic painted ware shape. It occurs mostly in red-on-buff but variations are found in the polychromes. There are 150 spider-leg vessels. A few black ware specimens are of the same form but with short, stubby supports. Form is the decorative feature of black ware, whereas it is of minor importance to painted ware. The excep- tion to this is the red-on-buff spider-leg tripod, banded in red, the extremely tall supports making the form strikingly handsome. Painted wares provide a greater variety of decoration, but all geometric. On red wares and red-rimmed speci- mens, paint may partially or entirely cover vessel; tabs and appendages often adorn rims and bodies. More complicated designs are found on red-and-buff, black and red, brown-on-red, and the polychromes. Chupicuaro polychromes use the base as a third color. This technique has been described elsewhere as pseudo- trichrome (Wauchope, 1950: 234) and trichromatic (Vaillant, 1931: 281). Black and red vessels have simple banded or interlocking teeth motifs. One is decorated with small curved hooks. All these designs are repeated in the black polychrome series. The two brown-on-red vessels are decorated with a thin-line stepped design. This is unique. Somewhat similar angular patterns do occur on a few red-on-buff speci- mens, but in these cases, the whole design is more complex. Motifs are often repeated and vary only slightly. The most common ones are listed in table 13, with their chronological range noted. TABLE 13 CHRONOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE OF DESIGN ELEMENTS Early Late Zig-zags X 1 pot Scroll X 0 Diamond chain X 1 pot Checkerboard X X Interlocking teeth X X Diagonal lines bordered by steps X X Cross-hatching X X Dot-filled diamond X X Single diamond X X Stepped triangles 0 X Cross 0 X Vertical stripes 0 X These designs are only the more common ones. Nearly all brown polychrome motifs fall into one of these cate- gories. Red-on-buff includes all listed motifs. Some aberrant ones occur which are usually simplified varia- tions of these common designs. The greatest variety of decoration is found in the black polychrome group. Aside from the Early Phase motifs listed above, several unique patterns are found. Most outstanding is the special red variant. Motifs are usually tiny stepped designs combined to form diamonds, triangles or zig- zags. Unique patterns include the black-winged motif and arrangements of scrolls and loops. Design motifs are not presented separately because so many complete vessels are illustrated. These give a good idea of the distribution of design on the specimens and since motifs are repeated continuously around the vessel, photographs are of more value than detailed descriptions or drawings. Many motifs were used during all phases. This is especially true of red-on-buff patterns. The polychrome designs are more distinctive. Those shared by both brown and black polychromes are common red-on-buff designs with the addition of black or brown paint. Early Phase designs are very carefully executed and must have required considerable time and precision. Lines are often thin; motifs intricate and complicated. The special red polychrome variant was made only after carefully working out the entire decoration.</page><page sequence="43">556 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Late Phase pottery carried on many of the simple banded motifs, especially those of plain bowls. De- signs tend to be greatly simplified. The common stepped diagonal has often been transformed into a wide diagonal stripe. Diamonds are not linked together in a chain, but occur singly as separate motifs. Designs are less complicated and bolder, made by a broader stroke in a wider field of operation. There is nothing comparable to the special red polychrome variant. Brown paint was applied after the red, but space was never so restricted as in black polychrome. Pottery could have been more swiftly decorated although no specimen shows carelessness or sloppy execution. Both techniques and decorative motifs suggest a trend to- wards greater simplification in the Late Phase. IX. HUMAN FIGURINES Clay figurines were abundant in graves as well as in general digging and on the surface. All are hand-mod- eled, the features and ornamentation executed by fillet- ing or applique with the exception of the large hollow types. Although several well-defined types will be dis- cussed, all share certain general features such as deco- rating the front only, leaving the back plain and as a rule quite flat. As is typical of hand-modeled figurines in other parts of Mesoamerica, attention was centered on modeling and decorating the head. Bodies are small in proportion to the head and poorly formed; a few gouges sufficed to indicate hands and feet.

Clothes are limited to a loin cloth on some male specimens. Jewelry such as necklaces, earplugs, bracelets, and leg bands are common. Men, women, and children are represented. The majority of figurines are modeled in standing position. When seated, the legs are short flat stubs. Arms are also short and stubby unless resting on the chest or abdomen. Headdresses are elaborate and great attention was given to hair style and ornamentation. Hair was commonly parted in the middle; bobs and bangs were popular. For classification the following procedure was used. Complete specimens and heads were combined, whether found in burials, general digging, or on the surface. These were then sorted according to general appearance and technique of manufacture. Once the main types were recognized, body fragments in many cases could be classified. Certain variations recognized within the larger groups were set up as subtypes. Each will be described and discussed according to the classification in table 14. 1. SLANT-EYE FIGURINES This figurine is not only the most abundant of the collection, making up 52.51 per cent of the total num- ber found, but is already rather well known in Mexico as Vaillant's H4 type (Vaillant, 1931: 263). It is eas- ily recognized by an extremely flat body, large head with slant eyes, and a nose that extends down to the chin, giving the face a mouse-like expression. The head may measure half the total height of the figure. Char- acteristic is a pronounced backward curvature of the head when viewed in profile. Features and ornaments are indicated by appliqued fillets. (a) Thin (fig. 16, a-o) The thin slant-eye type is the typical figure described above. These vary from 7.5 cm. to 13 cm. in height, are light buff in color with no slip or polish. The body is flat, thin, with little attempt made to portray the hu- man form; heart-shaped head set directly on shoulders, no neck. Shoulders are broad, terminating in extremely short stubby arms. Hair represented by filleting; ladies parted hair in center and drew it straight back to either side, bobbed short over ears, ends turning out, bangs popular. Hair often painted red and decorated with white ornaments and bands. Men did not part hair; used rosette-like ornaments, hair painted white. Eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows all made by filleting. Cloth- ing limited to loin cloth worn by some male figurines. Majority wear earplugs, either of cylindrical napkin- ring variety or solid disc-shaped type. Wide bracelets commonly worn on left or both arms. Necklace of beads or pendants was standard equipment. Leg bands, foot gear and special coiffures were limited to men. Women are distinguished by central part of hair (fig. 16, a-h). Men's hair was painted white; women's red.</page><page sequence="44">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] HUMAN FIGURINES 557 Earplugs, necklaces, and bracelets worn as much by men as by women (fig. 16, n, o). I wish to call atten- tion to body paint consisting of black horizontal lines with others extending up to waist and down the legs (fig. 16, f, g). (b) Fat (fig. 16, p-y) This figurine varies from that just described only in having a fat head, plump body, and pronounced but- tocks. Included in this group are those with cusp feet and pregnant women. Size slightly smaller, 4.5 cm. to 8 cm. in height. Eight have cusp feet, enabling figurine to stand erect (fig. 16, w, x). Seven specimens repre- sent women; the eighth a man. He wears a loin cloth and ornaments on his feet (fig. 16, y). Four specimens represent pregnant women (fig. 16, p, q). An unusual specimen, probably male, wears a leg band and rectan- gular piece of cloth on head which hangs down to center back. He also wears two sets of earplugs (fig. 16, r, s). Leg bands are also worn on the left leg by figurines in figures 16, j, k, m, and like r, j and k have wrist bands. One wonders whether these figurines may not represent ball players. (c) Long-nose (fig. 17, a-g) The separation of these figurines from the thin slant- eye may be of no real significance. They differ only slightly by having a more horizontal eye, long beak-like nose, face more rounded at bottom, and head less heart- shaped. Twenty figurines have a distinctive way of indicating the texture of hair by V-shaped incisions on either side of the part (fig. 17, d). Earplugs and banded hair ornaments are common. Since so many specimens in this group consist of fragments, other dis- tinctive features may have been missed. Size: 6.5 cm. to 10 cm. in height. (d) Squint-eye (fig. 17, h-k) These are unusually large and flat, and the eyes, placed almost horizontally, are made by two fillets of clay placed close together, producing a narrow squint- ing eye. Nostrils are indicated by two small holes. Heads are flat and less concave than in smaller figurines. Complete specimens are illustrated. Note body paint on fig. 17, j. (e) Button-eye (fig. 17, 1-r) Instead of making two long gouges, the filleted eye of this subtype has been modified by two circular punches. No effort was made to blend edges of fillet into the face. None was found in graves or caches, and the type is known only through surface finds or from gen- eral digging. No complete specimens. (f) Diamond-eye (fig. 17, n-q) The distinguishing feature of this group is a filleted eye decorated with four incisions forming a diamond. The specimens do not form a homogeneous group. The complete figurine (fig. 17, n-o) possibly shows transi- tion to choker type. It was made by using a back- board; color and finish are typical of Late Phase fig- urines. The diamond-shaped eye is the only Early fea- ture. Burial 114, which yielded this specimen, was accompanied by objects of both chronological phases and is therefore considered Transitional. (g) Unclassified Besides the figurines mentioned above, forty-four fragments were found in the general digging which be- long to the slant-eye general type and yet are not com- plete enough to permit subtype classification. Discussion Sixty-one slant-eye figurines were found in seven- teen burials and three caches. With the one exception mentioned above, they occur independently of other types. The general type is easily recognized and dis- tinguished by the abundant filleting, thin bodies with long slant eyes and concave head. Their abundance and the fact that they were found with graves make them outstandingly characteristic of Chupicuaro culture. Chronologically they are an Early Phase marker. Therefore distribution and comparative data are espe- cially interesting. The same type with fat and button- eye variants has been reported by Vaillant from the Valley of Mexico (Vaillant, 1930: 136; 1931: 363; Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 40). The thin figurine with slant eyes including the button-eye variant is clas- sified by Vaillant as type H4 (Vaillant, 1931: 363). Elsewhere he has published two fat types (Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: fig. 11-8, 12, 13), one of which is a male. These were found in the Late Period at Ticomtan (Vaillant, 1931: 363) and are well represented at Gua- lupita, Period II (Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 40). The present known distribution of the type includes Ticom'an, Cuicuilco, Azcapotzalco, Coatepec, Tetelpan, and Contreras in the Valley of Mexico, the State of Morelos, and as far north as San Juan del Rio, Quere- taro (Vaillant, 1930: 136). These finds by Vaillant were recovered during his general digging or were pur- chased. However, nowhere do they appear in such pro- fusion as at Chupicuaro and to date it is the only region which has yielded complete specimens with graves. 2. CHOKER FIGURINES This figurine, second in abundance, is, curiously enough, represented to a greater extent in burials than the slant-eye type. These two groups share the tech- nique of filleting and applique but a marked change is apparent in the method of manufacture. Choker fig- urines were made by pressing the soft clay against a flat surface with the fingers, making it triangular in cross section, with a perfectly flat back. The general appearance of choker figurines is messy, rather sloppy, the features being ill defined and run together. Size</page><page sequence="45">558 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUP!CUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. varies from 6.5 cm. to 8 cm. in height; 2.5 cm. wide. The type is very standardized. Color: light buff, un- less overfired. No slip. (a) Common (fig. 17, r-z; fig. 18, a) Bodies are long and narrow, a feature emphasized by high hair styles. Neck is replaced by a wide choker necklace. Figurines were probably modeled by pinch- ing head to make a nose and lower legs to make knees. No chin. Earplugs and bracelets are common, worn both by men and women. No loin-cloths, footgear or leg bands. Seven may represent children, since bodies are smooth and undeveloped (fig. 18, h, i). (b) Fine ivory (fig. 18, I-o) By present day standards, these are the prettiest found at Chupicuaro. Delicately modeled, the bodies are shapely with graceful arms and legs. General pro- portions are much closer to those of the human body. Posture shows shoulders thrown back. They have a fine ivory-like finish. No trace of paint. All are fe- male with one exception (fig. 18, m). He wears crescent-shaped ornaments on his feet. (c) Variants (fig. 18, d-e) Burial 266 yielded nine figurines which vary from the general type by being slightly smaller (4 to 6 cm. in height) and plumper. Legs are slightly flexed, bod- ies have traces of black paint. Women have long flow- ing hair. The group includes one male figurine. Speci- mens from Burial 276 and Cache 4 (fig. 18, b, c) vary slightly from common type. Discussion The choker figurine shares filleting with the slant-eye type but was probably modeled against a perfectly flat surface. In some cases, rough edges can be seen near the shoulders where the excess soft clay oozed out against something flat. These are still hand-modeled figurines, but the use of a back support introduces a new element which would restrict the free hand of the potter. These figurines were associated with ten graves and three caches. Unlike the slant-eye type, choker fig- urines were occasionally found with other types yet to be mentioned. Because of the late implications of some of the minor types, the choker figurines are considered Late. I know of no similar figurines from other parts of Mesoamerica. 3. CRUDE FIGURINES Five of these were found in the same burial and un- doubtedly represent the work of one craftsman (fig. 18, u-w). The group is not homogeneous. Figurines are poorly made, ill-proportioned and little care was taken in modeling head or body. Hands and feet are simple protuberances from the long trunk. Sex is seldom in- dicated. Facial features, necklaces, earplugs and head ornaments are made by filleting. Those from burials show the best workmanship and retain traces of white and red paint. One specimen had black body paint. The only male figurine is shown playing a flute (fig. 18, w). 4. PROGNATHIC FIGURINES Although not abundant, this type is very distinctive (fig. 18, y-z'). The clay is slightly reddish as con- trasted to the buff of figurines described so far. In size they are comparable, varying from 8 to 10 cm. in height. The body is broad shouldered with narrow rounded hips; small high waistline; short arms curve sharply and end in points. Back is flat except for sharply protruding buttocks. Head large and rectan- gular, set squarely on shoulders with aid of short choker necklace. Lower part of face shows marked prog- nathism in profile. Nose and mouth indicated by sharp horizontal cut. Ornamentation limited to napkin-ring type earplugs and occasional bracelet. These figurines differ in being of a ruddy colored paste and by using incisions in making the nose and mouth. Nevertheless, the filleted headdresses, rela- tively flat backs and wide choker necklaces suggest local manufacture. The marked prognathism calls to mind Vaillant's type E2 figurine of the Valley of Mexico. As illus- trated by him (1931: plate LVI), it has a similar head, pinched forward, flat in back. The features are made by incisions. Bodies are also similar to this Chupi- cuaro type. Although E types were found in greatest number in the Early Period of Ticoman, they appear throughout the Ticoman horizon (Vaillant, 1931: ta- ble 1). E2 figurines are widely distributed through- out the Valley of Mexico and are noteworthy because of connection with an early type from Teotihuactan (Vaillant, 1931: 347). There seems to be no com- parable figurine from other parts of West Mexico. 5. TRADE FIGURINES The four figurines found with Burial 221 (fig. 19, f-m) appear to be intrusive. They represent two couples, one pair standing and one seated. They are of ruddy granular paste, slipped in white; headdresses and hair painted red; bodies broad shouldered with tiny waist; legs spread apart in the two erect speci- mens. Facial features are indicated by light pre-slip incisions. The nose is modeled from the face and marked off by light incisions. Filleting was used only for headdress. The women's hair is simply indicated by a groove encircling the face; men wear elaborate stepped headdress. These figurines were found in a grave with fine ivory variants of the choker type. A fifth specimen was recovered in Pit 53. The four are especially significant since they are comparable to Vail- lant's H5 type in the Valley of Mexico. The typical H5 figurine is larger than these, but is slipped in white</page><page sequence="46">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] HUMAN FIGURINES 559 and has pre-slip incised eyes. The type was rare in the Late Period at Ticoman and is extremely scarce in the Valley. Two specimens were found at Azca- potzalco (Vaillant, 1931: 263). Although the Chupicuaro specimens resemble this H5 type, the stepped headdresses of the men are quite unlike anything reported by Vaillant. Instead, they are similar to Teotihuac'an jadeite figurines found with the Quetzalcoatl Temple offering (Rubin de la Bor- bolla, 1947). The clay specimens are not as refined, but the form of the headdress is the same. Its appear- ance at Chupicuaro comes as no small surprise. The style and workmanship of the four is contrary to the Chupicuaro tradition of filleting, absence of slip, legs held close together, and general flatness. The Teo- tihuacan type headdress does not appear prior to Pe- riod II at that great site and is most characteristic of Period III. Another trade specimen may be one from Burial 276 (fig. 19, a, b). Two others resemble it, but reflect more of the Chupicuaro style. These may be local products showing outside influence. A unique seated figurine found with Cache 4 may also be a trade piece (fig. 19, c). This specimen, hand- modeled, with rectangular head and appliqued features, is different from any other at Chupicuaro. The clay is yellow-orange in color and the figure was painted red. The bracelets worn on the upper arm and decorated with small incised circles are a feature not previously found. The hair is quite plain showing no part and is unlike any other hair style. 6. LARGE FIGURINES One large hollow figurine was found with Burial 218 (fig. 19, r-t) and four fragments of similar specimens were recovered. The regional museum in Morelia has three such figurines attributed to Chupicuaro, two of which are illustrated (fig. 19, n-q). These are painted in black polychrome style; the one from Burial 218 is simply decorated with red paint on buff colered base. These figures are hand-modeled, smooth, painted, and polished. Designs are purely geometric, repeti- tions of vessel motifs. Eyes are diamond-shaped, made by incising. The following similarities with the small figurines can be observed: the central part of the hair is indicated either by a vertical groove or a broad band of paint; two examples are thin and flat with concave heads in profile; body paint of horizontal black bands just below the waistline from which lines radiate in either direction. 7. UNCLASSIFIED FIGURINES There are 160 miscellaneous figurine fragments that have not been included in the types discussed above. For the most part these are so incomplete that they can- not be accurately classified. Others may be aberrant types (fig. 19, d, e, u-w; fig. 20, a-e, g-j). One type consists of a head with a characteristic flat headdress. There are four such fragments nearly iden- tical (fig. 20, g-i). A Teotihuacan I-like head was found in Pit 33 at a shallow depth and a flat moldmade figurine head re- sembling the Mazapan type was picked up on the sur- face (fig. 20, a). Another large solid head resembles a C type of the Valley of Mexico (fig. 19, w). Other miscellaneous fragments are probably variants of the main types described above. DISCUSSION OF FIGURINE TYPES The two outstanding Chupicuaro figurine types, the slant-eye and choker, share certain basic features such as flatness and filleting. On closer examination, how- ever, they are quite different. The slant-eye type is characterized by a heart-shaped face, clear-cut features with very oblique eyes and a peculiar backward curva- ture to the head. Choker figurines were probably mod- eled by pinching the soft clay against a flat surface. These long, narrow figurines are rigid in appearance and characterized by a wide, choker necklace. Numeri- cally the slant-eye figurine more than doubles the choker types (see table 14). A study of the occurrence of the two types shows that only in two burials were they found together. This immediately suggested a possible chronological differ- ence. An examination of the minor types found at Chupicuaro shows that these occur either alone, or in association with choker, but never with slant-eye. The slant-eye, named by Vaillant H4, was found to be con- temporaneous with the upper, or most recent phase of the Ticom'an Culture (Vaillant, 1931: 363). Four H5 type figurines occurred at Chupicuaro as trade pieces, found in Burial 221 in association with choker types. A comparison between the jadeite figurines found with the Quetzalcoatl offering in the Citadel, Teotihuacan (Rubin de la Borbolla, 1947: fig. 1 and 18), and the two male H5 figurines from Burial 221 (fig. 18, v, x) shows remarkable correspondence in headdress despite the difference in material. Armillas, who kindly ex- amined the Chupicuaro specimens, concurs. The Teo- tihuac'an figurines have not been accurately placed chronologically, but most people agree on either a Teo- tihuacan II or III date. According to Armillas, this particular Teotihuacran style headdress is typical of Pe- riod III, but may have appeared as early as II. The imported Burial 221 specimens could be either Teoti- huacan II or III, but owing to the lack of other ele- ments at Chupicuaro of the great classic period of Teotihuacan and because the other cross-ties with the Valley of Mexico are predominantly of the late Tico- man Period, they probably should not be dated later than Teotihuacan II. The white slip, incised features and general aspect of these figurines are completely for- eign to Chupicuaro tradition, so I see no grounds for postulating a western origin for them with eastward moving influence in this particular case.</page><page sequence="47">560 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The dating of these four figurines is very significant since it necessarily follows that the choker type, asso- ciated with them, is contemporaneous. There are other indications that the choker figurine is more recent than the slant-eye. The method of man- ufacture begins to show a trend towards or an attempt at a mechanical process to speed up production. In Mesoamerica, moldmade figurines do not appear prior to the Classic Period. This Chupicuaro type is not moldmade, but the use of a backboard suggests an ini- tial step towards standardization by the mold. Slant-eye figurines are far more numerous in gen- eral digging than in burials, something not true of choker figurines. This is understandable when one remembers that many Early graves were disturbed in making subsequent burials. Slant-eye figurines, then, were made in the Chupi- cuaro Early Phase. This was probably a long period and the figurines were produced in abundance. Al- though handmade, the types are very standardized. Figurines were buried with the dead, although in smaller numbers than in the Late Phase. No strong outside influence is apparent in these figurines although very similar types have been found in the Valley of Mexico and Morelos (Vaillant, 1931: 363; Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 40; Vaillant, 1930: 136). No- where are the slant-eye figurines so abundant as at Chupicuaro which may well have been the center of development. Only two figurines were found with burials classed as Transitional, a phase which may have been short, or may be hard to distinguish on the basis of the diag- nostic features recognizable at the present time. No figurine types are restricted to this phase. The choker figurines, diagnostic of the Late Phase, were still produced in abundance, with a greater variety of types. This seems to have been a period of increased contact with other cultures. The Chupicuaro prog- nathic type, or Vaillant's E2, is easily recognized as a distinct Late style. Also belonging to this phase are the crude and miscellaneous trade figurines. Influence may have been received from various centers; one of these was probably Teotihuacan. X. CLAY ARTIFACTS MINIATURE VESSELS Pottery vessels, too small to be practical, were prob- ably used as toys. There are seventeen, twelve of black ware and five painted (fig. 21, x-h'). Eleven are illus- trated showing variety in form and decoration. They are similar to the larger vessels already described. BEADS Two necklaces of clay beads were found with Caches 12 and 14 (fig. 25, c). They are almost identical, con- sisting of tiny tubular beads either painted red or left the natural buff color. Irregular in length, they vary from .3 to .12 cm. in length; diameter .2 cm. A pot- tery bead found in the digging is round with central perforation (fig. 21, o). It is black, incised with spiral design and preserves red paint in the incisions. Unique specimen. PENDANTS Three pendants were with Cache 4. Two represent seated human figures in the choker figurine style with suspension hole in the head. The third is an animal or conventionalized human figure (fig. 20, y-z'). EARPLUGS Fifty-six earplugs were found. (1) Tubular, open at both ends (fig. 21, k-i) Three found with graves. (2) Napkin-ring (fig. 21, a-e, h, i) Twenty-five; thirteen with graves. Uniform lot. Circular, flaring at both ends, usually more in front than in back; finely smoothed and polished. Black predominates but four are brown, one light buff. Dec- oration by notching rims or perforating wall (fig. 21, a, d, e). Traces of hematite paint. Size varies from 1.50 cm. by 2.60 cm. to 2.75 cm. by 2.75 cm. (3) Solid discs with concave sides (fig. 21, m, n) Fourteen; none with graves. Flat ends, concave walls. Smooth, polished, unslipped. Color brown to black. Decoration rare, simple incision. Size varies from 1.50 cm. diam. front and 1.25 cm. diam. back to 3.75 cm. diam. front and 3.50 cm. diam. back. Width 1 cm. The smaller specimens could conceivably be labrets. They resemble some of these objects illustrated by Vaillant (1930: 153). No figurine is represented wearing a labret, however, whereas earplugs are worn by all. (4) Napkin-ring closed at one end (fig. 21, f, g, j) Two specimens were found with graves, twelve in general digging. In shape they resemble solid discs with concave sides, but open at back. Polished, brown or black, two painted red. Closed end decorated by incising. Smallest B.187: Early Phase, diam. 2.80 cm.; largest: Pit 41, diam. 4 cm. Width varies from 1 to 1.50 cm. No clay earplugs were found in Late Phase burials. All figurines have earplugs and their absence in Late Phase burials could be caused by the relatively small sample. But it could mean that clay earplugs were either not actually worn in the Late Phase or were fashioned from some perishable material. The napkin-ring earplug appears first in Middle Zacatenco in the Valley of Mexico. Apparently the tubular type is slightly earlier, dating from El Arbolillo (Vaillant, 1935: 237). The solid disc-shaped type does</page><page sequence="48">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] CLAY ARTIFACTS 561 TABLE 15 CHRONOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE OF EARPLUGS Early Transitional L ate (1) Tubular 2 0 0 (2) Napkin-ring 8 1 0 (3) Solid disc 0 0 0 (4) Napkin ring 2 0 0 Total 12 1 0 not appear earlier than Ticom'an (Vaillant, 1931: 296). The earlier forms continued at Ticoman, but in the Late Period, the ornate type, closed and carved at one end, is also found (Vaillant, 1931: 399). The latter has been reported by Tozzer (1921: 46) from San- tiago Ahuizotla, from Tehuacan (Noguera, 1940: 314) and by Ekholm, mostly in his upper level (1 to 6) probably of classic Teotihuacan date, at Acapulco, Guerrero (Ekholm, 1948: 101). Levels 5 and 6 were probably Late Formative. This evolution of earplugs seems to hold good for most of Mesoamerica, but the last type is very rare. A good summary of the distri- bution of earplugs is given by Kidder (Kidder, Jen- nings and Shook, 1946: 215). According to these data, Chupicuaro earplugs bear out a Ticom'an III dating for the Early Phase. STAMPS Of three objects doubtfully classified as stamps, one, a surface find, somewhat resembles cylindrical stamps found elsewhere in Mexico, but the others have un- usual shapes. All are illustrated (fig. 21, p-r). Stamps first appear in the Valley of Mexico sequence at Tlatilco, where a great variety was found (Porter, 1953: 41). They continue in Ticom'an periods and are known from Gualupita in Morelos (Vaillant, 1931: 400; Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 98). Stamps are common at Teotihuacan and in subsequent periods in Mesoamerica. A great variety of geometric and nat- uralistic stamp designs has been presented by Enciso (1948). WORKED SHERDS Fragments of pottery that have been reworked are not uncommon in Mesoamerica. Thirty-two were found at Chupicuaro (fig. 21, i'-o'). With the excep- tion of two unusually large ones, all are notched on opposite sides. Notches are worn smooth as if a cord had passed around each sherd. It has been suggested that worked sherds were used in games as counters, or, if perforated, as spindle whorls. None of the Chupi- cuaro sherds are perforated. The notch on either side suggests that they were some kind of instrument, per- haps net sinkers. A tripod vessel, offering with dog burial 23, contained 16 worked sherds. Rectangular, triangular, and round worked sherds have been reported by Kelly from all phases of Apatzin- gan (Kelly, 1947: 98), and by Vaillant from Zacatenco and Early Ticoman (Vaillant, 1930: 155), becoming rare in Late Ticom'an (Vaillant, 1931: 297). Notched specimens from Mesoamerica reported in the literature are from Quintana Roo (Noguera, 1940a: 13) and La Venta (Drucker, 1952: 144 and pl. 45), assumed to have been used as weights. CLAY BALLS No clay balls were with graves, but nine were found in the course of general digging (fig. 21, t-w). A few have simple punched decorations; none is painted. In size these vary from 2.25 cm. to 3.50 cm. Use un- known. These objects are not uncommon in the Valley of Mexico Formative (Vaillant, 1930: 156; 1931: 396). RIM HEADS Eight clay heads from general digging had probably been used as vessel rim ornaments (fig. 20, w, x). Three of these are round heads with filleted eyes, nose, and mouth. There is no uniformity among the others but all represent human heads. ANIMAL FIGURES Twenty-three fragments were found in general dig- ging, one in a grave. Monkeys, dogs, deer, and birds can be identified. Others are too conventionalized for recognition. Some are well modeled. These figurines seem to have served no practical purpose (fig. 20, k, p-v). MISCELLANEOUS Clay foot A solid clay foot showing five toes with nails was found in Pit 78 (fig. 20, 1). This does not correspond to any known Chupicuaro figurine foot. Spider-shaped objects Three spider-like clay objects were found during the general digging (fig. 20, n, o), broken but having a broad curved body with appendages extending from sides and back. One shows traces of red paint. No specimen is complete enough to permit reconstruction. Hatchet-shaped objects A hatchet-shaped object of clay was recovered from the surface. This resembles an arm fragment of a fig- urine, although none was found of this type (fig. 20, in). Pipe stem A fragment of a long pipe stem was found during the excavation of the Solis Dam. It is slipped in orange and decorated with a wavy fillet of clay running the length of the top. This is characteristic of the Tula, Hidalgo style, undoubtedly belonging to the Mazapan Horizon, much later than Chupicuaro (fig. 21, s).</page><page sequence="49">562 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Unusual vessel supports Three hollow vessel supports were found on the sur- face. These are unlike any on the vessels with the graves (fig. 21, p'-s'). Spindle whorls Two solid spindle whorls were found; one on the surface at Chupicuaro and one at the Solis Dam. No whorls were found with burials and these specimens probably belong to a later period. XI. MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS Musical instruments include rattles, ocarinas, bone rasps, a flute, whistle and a turtle shell. All are of clay except the rasps and the turtle shell. RATTLES Eight (burials 6; caches 2). Plain ball rattles (fig. 22, s) or with handle (fig. 22, w). Human effigy rat- tles represent seated female figure (fig. 22, r), decorated in slant-eye figurine, style. Bird effigies (fig. 22, 1, m) are light buff with red and white paint. OCARINAS Ten (burials 6; general digging 4). Round or rec- tangular bodies, flattened on top with five stops and mouthpiece protruding from one side. All have two small supports, perforated probably for suspension. These ocarinas may represent turtles, but form is very conventionalized. Four painted red; others vary from brown to black. Decorated by rim notches or incised diamonds on upper surface. Largest B.85: ht. 3 cm., length 5 cm.; smallest B.139: ht. 2 cm., length 4 cm. (fig. 22, n-q). WHISTLE Sole whistle is effigy specimen from Burial 115 (fig. 22, u), representing seated individual with prognathic face, hands on knees. The fragmented head forms mouthpiece and large navel opens into a round hollow body. Gray, unpainted. FLUTES The slug-shaped flute, Burial 203, is unique (fig. 22, t). Open at both ends, it has five small stops down the top of the body with a large orifice near mouthpiece. Black, lightly polished. Two small fragments of simi- lar flutes were found on the surface, but were straight instead of curved. BONE RASPS Six (burials 2; digging 4). This musical instrument, made from a hollow bone, has a series of notches along one side. Sounds were produced by rubbing another bone or conch shell across notches. Four fragmented specimens were made from human femurs with a per- foration for suspension at one end (fig. 22, y-z'). Oth- ers are made from a bird bone and a deer metapodial. TURTLE SHELL A turtle shell was found at the feet of a child's skele- ton. The entire shell, carapace and plastron, was in good condition. According to Dr. Manuel Maldonado Koerdell of the Instituto de Geologia, Mexico, it is of the genus Kinosternon, common throughout highland Mexico. The shell had not been worked or painted (fig. 22, x). Kidder (Kidder, Jennings and Shook, 1946: 156) calls attention to the use of these objects as rattles or drums. Since no pellets were found, the Chupicuaro specimen may have served the latter purpose. DISCUSSION Musical instruments include rattles, ocarinas, bone rasps, flutes, turtle shell drum and a whistle which rep- resent considerable variety considering the limitations imposed by lack of metals. However, little can be in- ferred regarding music among the Chupicuarenos. It may have had a special significance for children, since nearly all musical instruments were in children's graves. Only one ocarina and bone rasp were with adult skele- tons. Two musicians are represented in the figurines (fig. 18, c and w), both male. Since female figurines far outnumber male, it would seem that this art was restricted to men.

Some kind of musical instrument is present in nearly every phase of the Valley of Mexico sequence, but specimens do not closely resemble the Chupicuaro ones. El Arbolillo, Zacatenco, and Ticom'an have rattles and whistles in all levels, although in the former relatively rarely. Two whistles and two rattles were recovered at Gualupita, probably of Gualupita II date (Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 98). At Ticom'an, whistles are more prevalent in the Early Period, but are of the bird form common at Tlatilco. Whistles have a much wider distribution than ocarinas. These usually represent ,birds (Vaillant, 1930: 155 and plate 38; Ekholm, 1944: 459), in a style entirely absent from Chupicuaro. No</page><page sequence="50">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] OBSIDIAN 563 elaborate rattles with handles or human effigy rattles such as those reported here have been found elsewhere. Ocarinas are not common outside the Chupicuaro re- gion. Flutes are reported from Ticom'an (Vaillant, 1931: 395), Teotihuacan (Linne, 1934: 128) in Upper Tres Zapotes (Drucker, 1943: 116), possibly at Kaminaljuyui made of a human femur (Kidder, Jennings and Shook, 1946: 153) and from West Mexico in Colima, Tuxca- cuesco area of Jalisco and Chametla, Sinaloa (Kelly, 1947: 95; 1949: 109; 1938: 51). None were recov- ered at Apatzing'an. Most of these are of later date than those from Chupicuaro. In no area do they seem particularly abundant. Bone rasps have been amply discussed in the litera- ture. The most comprehensive treatment is by Linne (1934: 128). Distribution is widespread in Meso- america, particularly on later horizons. Early finds are reported by Vaillant from Late El Arbolillo I (Vaillant, 1935: 246) and by Noguera from the Pyra- mid of the Sun (Noguera, 1935: pl. 13, fig. 13). Per- haps the most spectacular find was a later one by Garcia Payon in the Valley of Toluca where 361 notched bones were found (Garcia Payon, 1941: 73). He doubts, however, that these were musical instruments. Turtle shells have been reported from the Esperanza Phase of Kaminaljuyu' (Kidder, Jennings and Shook, 1946: 156), from Cerro de las Mesas (Stirling, 1941: 286) and Uaxactu'n (Kidder, 1947: 59). Torquemada describes the use of turtle shells as a drum in a Tarascan funeral procession (Torquemada, 1723: 2: 525) and Lumholtz illustrates a clay figurine from Nayarit beat- ing on a turtle shell (Lumholtz, 1902: 2: pl. 1, a-c). XII. OBSIDIAN In spite of abundant obsidian fragments on the sur- face at Chupicuaro, very few worked implements ac- companied the burials. The obsidian is gray with the exception of a large finely chipped red knife (obsidian) (fig. 23, e). One flint artifact is included here, a tiny grey tanged point (fig. 23, k). KNIVES Seven (burials 3; general digging 4). Three speci- mens are large flakes with inner side smooth, notable percussion bulb at one end. Longest, B.159: 19.5 cm. in length (fig. 23, h). An attempt was made to re- touch one edge of the inner side by striking off very fine chips; outer surface convex with a central longi- tudinal ridge; one edge crudely retouched. The other two specimens, surface finds, are similar but measure only 13.5 cm. in length (fig. 23, i). The red obsidian knife is of the finest workmanship (fig. 23, e). The blade is straight with convex sides converging at either end. Both surfaces have been re- touched, chipping the knife to an oval cross-section. In color it is mottled reddish brown. There are three smaller specimens. A fine laurel leaf knife from Burial 316 (fig. 23, f) carefully chipped on both surfaces. Another is relatively crude and was simply flaked off a core. No retouching (fig. 23, g). FINE LONG BLADES Two (iburial 1; surface 1). Specimen from Burial 266 is almost complete, lacking only a fragment of the stem (fig. 23, a). The other, a surface find, lacks tlhe point. Probably these were very similar to each other. The blade is long, tapering, oval in section; stem is broad. Both specimens have been neatly and evenly retouched on all surfaces. SCRAPERS Six (burials 3; general digging 3). Round scrapers were formed by broad thin flakes (fig. 23, w, x). One still shows flat base of the core and has been only slightly retouched along the opposite edge on humped side which still retains some of outer core's original scars. Inner surface is unaltered and is almost flat except for slight percussion bulb. The other is oval flake knocked off a core at an angle; quite flat except for a broad percussion bulge. No retouching. The other scrapers are long flakes, broad at one end, tapering at the other; convex. The finest specimen is smooth and unaltered on inner surface; edges on humped side retouched, center smooth and flat (fig. 23, c). A small, curved scraper found near Burial 51 was probably not associated with it. The remaining scrapers are roughly similar in form but are crude, unaltered flakes. Representative group illustrated; provenience and range of sizes given in figure explana- tion. POINTS Twenty-three (burials 10; dog burials 4; general dig- ging 9). The three largest are illustrated (fig. 23, b, Mi, n). All are retouched. There is considerable vari- ety of shape among the small points, varying from al- most triangular to long, sharply tapering (fig. 23, I-v). DISCUSSION Although several specimens show skilled workman- ship, the obsidian tools are not on the same level as other aspects of the culture. Twenty-eight specimens, including eleven surface finds, form a very small sample in an area yielding nearly four hundred graves. This is puzzling in view of the abundant supply of obsidian close at hand. Probably many surface fragments were used as cutting tools without alteration. It is curious that no long thin prism flaked blades were found, as these are so typical of all horizons in Mesoamerica. Chronological distribution is shown in table 17. In the Valley of Mexico tanged points appear in Ticom'an periods and continue thereafter. Untanged points are the common types of Early and Middle Zacatenco Periods. Points that most resemble those</page><page sequence="51">564 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.

Round scrap- ers were also found at Ticoman. A long convex scraper much like the specimen from Burial 333 from Chupi- cuaro, is illustrated by De Terra from Teotihuacan (De Terra, 1949: plate 19, g). The latter is attributed to an "archaic" burial (De Terra, 1949: 159). A similar scraper is illustrated by Vaillant from Gualupita from mixed debris (Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: fig. 32-7). XIII. SHELL For the most part, the work on shell has so altered the original specimen that identification is impossible. A few of the unworked shells were kindly examined and classified by Dr. Leo G. Hertlein of the California Acad- emy of Sciences in San Francisco. UNWORKED SHELL Shells of eight fresh water land snails, Bulimulus, were found with graves (fig. 25, n). Several have a small perforation, and one retains traces of red paint. A badly weathered marine shell has been identified as Fasciolaria sp., found both on the east and west coasts of Mexico (fig. 25, n top right). Three small weath- ered shells, Cypraea arabicula Lam., were with Burial 356. These are found only on the west coast of Mexico. Twenty-four fresh-water clam shells were identified as Anodonta aff. A. chalcoensis C. and F., restricted to Lake Chalco in the Valley of Mexico. Ten were found with graves, the rest in general digging. CRESCENT-SHAPED ORNAMENTS Two crescent-shaped objects, perforated at either end, may be nose ornaments (fig. 25, d, e). Two similarly shaped specimens are of stone (fig. 27, w, z). BEADS Nineteen necklaces were mostly of shell beads. In one case the shells have simply been perforated and strung. This is a long necklace of small Marginella marine shells, occasionally broken by Oliva tinklers and irregular green stone beads (fig. 25, a). The shells uti- lized for other beads cannot be identified. Beads vary in color from white to different shades of pink. There is a great variety of form. All are illustrated. Pro- venience and sizes are given in figure explanations (fig. 24 and 25a). PENDANTS Shell tinklers made by cutting off the closed end of Oliva shells are the most common pendants (fig. 25, f). These have been perforated for suspension by a trans- verse saw cut or by drilling. Tinklers are also strung in bead necklaces. Shell pendants were found with six burials and one cache. A flat fragment of shell with suspension hole was found with Burial 83. Length 4.30 cm. Not illus- trated. Two other shell pendants were associated with Burial 392. One is elongated with rounded edges and the second is smaller, rectangular and shaped like an incisor. Both have suspension holes at one end. Size: 4.20 cm. in length. Not illustrated. A curious winged pendant of shell was found in the general digging (fig. 25, i). MISCELLANEOUS Shell earplugs Burial 108 yielded a tiny white funnel-shaped ring which may have served as an earplug (fig. 25, k). A lightly incised line encircles the opening of the flared end. Curved shell fragment A lunar-shaped shell fragment was found with Burial 284 (fig. 25, in). Breaks have exposed a bright coral color on interior. Two unsuccessful attempts have been made to perforate it. Shell figurine Burial 346 yielded a rather crude human figure of shell (fig. 25, 1). It is slightly convex. Traces of red paint are preserved on one arm. A nearly identical specimen of pumice was found at Tlatilco in the gen- eral digging. It measures 4.75 cm. in length by 2.25 cm. in width. Col. Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Mexico. Sequins Three flat shell beads resembling sequins were found with Burial 107 (fig: 25, h). DISCUSSION Only a few shell specimens could be identified. Most had been worked beyond recognition or were badly weathered. Shells common to both east and west coasts were found, along with some restricted either to the west coast or the Valley of Mexico. Therefore trade with the latter regions is substantiated. There is no conclusive evidence of trade farther east. The workmanship on shell is neither unusual nor outstanding for Mesoamerica. Beads, pendants, tin- klers, a few ornaments, an earplug, and a crude human</page><page sequence="52">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] BONE AND ANTLER 565 figurine represent the variety of artifacts at Chupicuaro. Beads are the most common shell object. These range from simple perforated shells to carefully carved beads. The finest specimen is the necklace from Burial 111, comprised of uniformly cut triangular beads decorated with tiny notches or incisions (fig. 24, j). Of the twenty-seven graves yielding shell artifacts, nineteen were of children and ten adults. It is pos- sible that these objects had some significance as charms or amulets to be worn until the individual was of age, or perhaps they were simply a token of affection given to children. Chronologically shell objects were evenly distributed between Early and Late Phases (table 18).

The unworked shells testify to trade relations with the west coast of Mexico in all phases. The Chalcoensis shells, however, were found with a Late Phase burial, proving contact, direct or indirect, with the Valley of Mexico at that time. The crescent-shaped shell ornaments which may have been used as nose plugs have been found in many re- gions. They have been reported from west Mexico at Apatzing'an (Kelly, 1947: 119) Delicias and Chila phases, also from the Tuxcacuesco-Zapotitlan zone of Jalisco (Kelly, 1949: 132) and from the Tepalcatepec Basin (Goggin, 1943: 55). Distribution in other areas includes the Huasteca Period V (Ekholm, 1944: fig. 52, z, 482), Aljojuca, Puebla (Linne, 1942: fig. 18) and Uaxactu'n in the Peten region of Guatemala (Kid- der, 1947: 66). Kelly says (1949: 132) that this form of adornment apparently is widespread in West Mexico but does not extend as far north as Sinaloa. Hrdlicka (1903: pl. 41, figs. 1, 3, 4, 6) figures several such speci- mens from Totoate, Zacatecas as well as more elab- orate but basically similar forms (Hrdlicka, 1903: pl. 41, figs. 2, 5). No shell artifacts of this kind have been found at the Tarascan site of Tzintzuntzan, Mi- choac'an, nor does Vaillant report them from the Val- ley of Mexico. XIV. BONE AND ANTLER Workmanship on bone and antler is not outstanding. Only two antler punches were found, and thirty-eight artifacts of bone. Deer bone was used throughout ex- cept for a small bird bone and a human femur. The bone rasps have been included under musical instru- ments. ANTLER Two badly weathered deer horn instruments were sharpened to points and used as tools (fig. 26, b). BONE AWLS Dagger-like instruments made from metapodial deer bones were probably used as awls. This group of nine- teen tools is very uniform (fig. 25, o, fig. 26, a left). Part of the flat side of the shaft was cut away exposing the interior. The bone was worked to a sharp point for boring, punching or prying. PUNCHES Eleven sharp deer bone tools are too thin for any use other than boring small holes. All but one are illustrated (fig. 26, a). NEEDLES Only two were found, one of which is broken at the eye. Both are illustrated (fig. 26, a, extreme right). PENDANTS Four curious objects nearly identical were found in pairs in two burials (fig. 26, e, f). These were prob- ably ornaments since edges are not sharp enough for cutting. Finish is smooth and one pair is excellently polished. Another pendant consists of a small rectan- gular piece of bone with two perforations which pene- trate only to hollow core; smooth but unpolished. Use unknown (fig. 26, c). BIRD BONE A fragment of bird bone had been sharply cut at either end but in other respects was unworked. Hol- low core retains traces of hematite paint (fig. 26, d). WORKED HUMAN FEMUR The head end of a human femur was neatly severed 5 cm. from tip. A hole was drilled near the cut. Use unknown (fig. 26, g). DISCUSSION Bone and antler artifacts were neither numerous nor outstanding. Instruments include awls, punches, and needles. The other specimens were probably ornaments. Most bone objects were associated with graves, but the human femur fragment was found with a dog burial,</page><page sequence="53">566 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.

Workmanship on bone and antler is confined to drilling holes or shaping a point. There is no carving or dec- oration. Instruments were strictly utilitarian and the few ornaments are very simple. Not all artifacts can be placed chronologically but distribution seems even. The apparent increase in the Late Phase may be misleading owing to the small sam- ple (table 19). Awls, punches, and needles have a wide distribution in Mesoamerica. Since the knowledge of metal-working had not yet reached this area, inhabitants relied mostly on bone and stone implements. Use dictated form, and cultural changes are not apparent in bone work. XV. STONE As has been mentioned, a crate containing most of the stone artifacts has been lost and therefore those articles cannot be reported in full. The smaller pieces, few in number, were packed among other objects and arrived safely in Mexico City. The missing crate con- tained manos, metates, and round stone balls. Infor- mation on these is necessarily limited to our field notes. METATES Ten metates or fragments were found with graves. Both plain and legged types were found. Two zoo- morphic metates had four square straight legs, repre- senting an animal with head and tail protruding from the squared ends. This type metate is illustrated by an example from the Morelia museum, probably from Chupicuaro (fig. 27, a, d). Metates were found with three Early and two Late graves. MANOS Manos were found accompanying the metates and independently. Zoomorphic metates have small manos that fit inside the vertical walls. Those of the basin- shaped metates are longer. Three were in Early graves and one in a Transitional grave. STONE BALLS Numerous stone balls were found with the burials but more often as isolated objects (fig. 27, h, i, j). Sometimes these were lined up in neat rows or stacked in piles. Use unknown. They vary in size from 11 to 14 cm. diameter. Always well rounded, they were never smooth or polished. Eight balls were found in burials and at least seventy- five more appeared in the course of the general digging. These were usually in groups of five or more. Linne (1934: 135) suggests that stone balls in later periods at Teotihuacan were used in plastering angles. At Chupicuaro we found no buildings or rooms intact, and the balls were extremely numerous for a mason's tool. Such stone balls were also found at Zacatenco and Ticom'an (Vaillant, 1930: 156; 1931: 412), some of which were polished. MOLCAJETE A round stone molcajete (Burial 154, Late Phase) was a unique piece. Basin-shaped with three straight round supports, it resembled the stone molcajetes sold in modern Mexican markets. No grinding stone was with it. POLISHING STONES Only four specimens of various shapes were found. All are illustrated. Both Early and Late Phase occur- rence (fig. 27, e, f, k, q). BEADS No necklaces were made of stone beads exclusively, but green stone beads were commonly included with shell. These are usually flat, disc-shaped beads with a suspension hole in the center or near one edge. Tubular stone beads are less frequent. CRESCENT-SHAPED ORNAMENTS Two of these objects (fig. 27, w, z) resemble simi- larly shaped shell specimens (fig. 25, d, e). One is of talc and very white in color. The other is gray stone, lacking perforations, and is decorated with five incised lines running lengthwise. A similar stone ornament is reported by Goggin (1943: 55) from the Rio Tepal- catepec Basin. EARPLUGS Only one stone earplug of napkin-ring shape was found (fig. 27, p). It is probably of talc. Color is light mottled green. PENDANTS Two specimens not illustrated are rough stones, un- polished and slightly larger than beads. They are ir- regular with an off-center perforation. A small white bird, probably of talc, has conventionalized head, wings, and tail. The body is perforated transversely by drill- ing from both sides (fig. 27, y'). A rectangular pen- dant, pinkish in color, is of porphyritic igneous rock with white feldspar phenocrysts. Both sides are deco- rated with crudely scratched lines (fig. 27, t).</page><page sequence="54">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] PLEISTOCENE FOSSILS 567 PLUMB-BOBS One and possibly two specimens may be plumb-bobs (fig. 27, r, s). Stone is well polished, black. One is perforated from the top and the flattened side, so that a string can pass directly out of the top. Plumb-bobs have been reported from Teotihuactan (Gamio, 1922: 1: 216, pl. 120, c) and Xolapan (Linne, 1934: 134 and fig. 276). Linne is not certain of the use of the latter specimen since the fine finish suggests it may have been an ornament. In both instances, a string passed from the side out through the center top. These probably post-date the Chupicuaro plumb-bobs. MISCELLANEOUS A curious boot-shaped object of unknown use is made of a calcareous concretion (fig. 27, u). It is rough and unpolished; white. A diatomite ball broken in half was with Burial 93 (fig. 27, v). It is white and chalky, very light. Use unknown. Seven elongated stones are slightly crescent-shaped (fig. 26, s). A similarly shaped stone is illustrated by Vaillant from Middle Zacatenco (Vaillant, 1930: 161, pl. XLI) and described as a polishing tool or amulet. Small obj ects of clay of the same shape are known in the Huasteca (Ekholm, 1944: fig. 48, o, p). A curious worked stone is about the size of an egg and so shaped. A groove was cut around the diameter, interrupted by a deep gash running from end to end, removing approximately one eighth of the stone (fig. 27, n). Such objects have been found at La Venta (Drucker, 1952: 142, pl. 42, left, h-k) and at Tres Zapotes (Weiant, 1943: pl. 65) where they were pos- sibly used as weights. A small stone sculpture of porous lava represents a seated figure holding a child (fig. 27, z'). The work- manship is simple and rather crude. Twenty-six very small stone balls were found in the general digging (fig. 27, g). The larger ones already mentioned were much more common. DISCUSSION Chupicuaro stone work is not outstanding in crafts- manship or originality. The zoomorphic metates were carefully made, although the carving is rather crude. Perhaps the finest work is in the plumb-bobs, which are beautifully cut and polished. Pendants, beads, and pol- ishing stones are not particularly noteworthy. It is interesting to find the crescent-shaped ornament made both of shell and stone. XVI. PAINTED HEADDRESS Preservation at Chupicuaro was so poor that there was no trace of textiles, basketry, or wood. The only perishable material was a painted decoration preserved in the soil directly above the head of a skeleton, Burial 28. Presumably this decoration had been painted on a headdress, but all had disappeared save a portion of the painted design. The background was dark red, with a yellow and robin's egg blue twined motif. The painting was removed intact to the field head- quarters but the colors soon faded and the soil crumbled. The sketch is from a water color made by Rom'an Pifia Chan when the painting was first exposed. The burial belongs to the Early Phase. XVII. PLEISTOCENE FOSSILS While excavating the El Rayo hill, several pits yielded gravel instead of the sterile tepetate below burial deposits. The gravel extended across the central part of the hill but did not continue as far east as Pit 40 and appeared only in the southern part of Pit 33. In sev- eral pits, we dug through the gravel to the underlying tepetate. Pits 39 and 42 yielded fragments of fossils in the gravel, which began to appear at a 2.00-meter depth and continued to 4.35 meters. The gravel consisted of yellowish colored smooth round stones. These were tightly packed and mixed with sand, making digging a slow, difficult process. Fossil fragments were scattered through the gravel. Although most were found in Pit 42, a few appeared in Pit 39. Only 22 were large enough to permit identi- fication. These have been examined by Dr. Donald E. Savage of the University of California Department of Paleontology and by Dr. Manuel Maldonado Koerdell of the Geologic Institute in Mexico City who kindly furnished the following information. Equus, the American horse, was represented by nine teeth including molars, incisors and median phalanx (fig. 26, n-p). There are a proximal phalanx, probably antilocapra (fig. 26, r), and fragments of a radius, prox- imal phalanx and molars of a slender Camelid, cf. Tanupolama or Camelops (fig. 26, m, q). There are other long bone fragments of medium-sized carnivorous animals, possibly coyotes. Seven specimens are illus- trated (fig. 26, l-r). All fossils have been turned over to the Instituto de Prehistoria of the Instituto Nacional</page><page sequence="55">568 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. de Antropologia e Historia, Mexico, with details on exact provenience. All specimens found in the gravel are presumably Pleistocene. No human remains or artifacts were asso- ciated with them. XVIII. SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION Archaeology never supplies the whole record of a culture, because the material with which it deals has been highly selected. Time has destroyed all but the most durable objects such as stone, bone, pottery, metal, and some shell, and even many of these are so poorly preserved that scientific identification is impossible. But how much of the culture of a people do these re- mains tell? What about food, shelter, religion, beliefs and custom, superstition, social relationships, language? Without some form of writing and its preservation, nearly all these perishables or intangibles lie beyond the reach of the archaeologist. Compensation lies only in the great temporal scope of this discipline for through archaeology this fragmentary history may be followed as far into the past as there is any evidence of human culture. What has been offered here then can only be a mere fragment of Chupicuaro culture. And since the knowl- edge of metal-working had not yet reached Mesoamer- ica, the materials preserved are confined to stone, bone, shell, and pottery. Moreover, the stone, bone, and shell artifacts are so few and so unimaginative that informa- tion is almost restricted to that afforded by pottery. To undertake discussion of an ancient culture based only on its ceramic achievements is ambitious, but un- fortunately this is often the archaeologist's plight. He must present what facts there are and make the most of them. From the study of Chupicuaro remains, although lim- ited almost entirely to burials and pottery, it is possible to glean considerable information about the early in- habitants of this river region. Fortunately, because they buried instead of cremating their dead, and be- cause they equipped them with provisions for the here- after in baked clay vessels of wide variety, we are pro- vided with an unusual wealth of material. Let me now begin with the earliest signs of activity in the region and try to tell the story of Chupicuaro as each fragment of history falls into place. Far back in that prehistoric period known as the Pleistocene, probably during the Wisconsin Glacia- tion, small horses, camels, a kind of antelope, and vari- ous carnivorous animals roamed and grazed in central highland Mexico. Some of them perished in the Chupi- cuaro region, and their bones were washed into a two- meter gravel deposit on the El Rayo hill. These are the most ancient remains uncovered and were not ac- companied by any trace of human culture. There is good reason to believe, however, that Man did occupy central Mexico as long ago as the late Wisconsin Glaci- ation, and that he lived partly by hunting great Pleisto- cene animals, as shown by the discovery in March, 1952, of six artifacts in primary association with a mammoth at Santa Isabel Ixtapan (Early Man, 1952: 90). This period, the end of the last ice age, is followed by a tremendous gap in the record, not only in Chupi- cuaro, but in the whole of Mesoamerica. Recently more attention has been devoted to this span of time. There are only scant traces of the existence of pre-agricultural man. Finds include the Tepexpan skeleton (De Terra, Romero and Stewart, 1949) and chipped lithic remains of the Chalco culture identified by de Terra from vari- ous sites in the Valley of Mexico and Chupicuaro (De Terra, Romero and Stewart, 1949: 65-67). In 1946 Dr. de Terra spent two days at Chupicuaro where he found basalt end scrapers, choppers, knives, and two projectile points on surface outcrops, supposedly be- tween the gravel deposits and the burials (de Terra, verbal information). Our burials, however, lay in soil directly over the gravel. In the next chapter of man's history he gave up his nomadic life as hunter and gatherer, preferring to settle down with his family and become a farmer. The story of how this radical change came about would indeed be fascinating. Unfortunately very little is known of this transitional period of incipient agriculture in Meso- america (Strong, 1951: 275). Beginnings of settled communities did not necessarily take place in the high- lands, however, and a good case has been made favoring a lowland origin (Shook, 1951: 99). In order to understand what happened at Chupicuaro, it is necessary to keep in mind the sequence of events in the Valley of Mexico, since this is the nearest cen- ter of Formative activity best known to us at the present time. The archaeological record shows that by 1350 B.C. (Carbon 14 date for Zacatenco I horizon, Johnson, 1951: 7), man had already acquired much of the basic pattern of later Mesoamerican civilization. He was no longer a nomad but a farmer. He now planted corn, and probably squash and beans. The rudimentary be- ginnings of a theocratic society with the formation of religious concepts, the exchange of goods with other communities, and some type of construction are fea- tures already present in the record of Formative cul- tures in the Valley of Mexico. The oldest cultural phase there has been called Early El Arbolillo I which is believed to antedate slightly but merges into Early Zacatenco (Vaillant, 1935: 251). These two phases reveal a culture with permanent vil- lages and an economy based on the cultivation of corn. Stone implements were of a type that changed little for several centuries. Quantities of elaborate figurines were produced and pottery was incised or painted with white lines on a red background. The next phase was one of major importance, that of Middle Zacatenco, which can be more readily under-</page><page sequence="56">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION 569 stood in terms of Early and Late subdivisions. The Early phase merely continued the Early Zacatenco cul- ture with minor changes and innovations in painted wares and artifacts. The Late Middle Zacatenco phase is marked by richer cultural manifestations together with intrusion of elements foreign to highland Mexico but quite at home on the Gulf Coast. This new com- plex of traits, shared by Gualupita I and II in Morelos, is best represented in the Valley of Mexico at Tlatilco, but traces of it are present in the Xalostoc material from the northern shore of Lake Texcoco. This com- plex, a predominantly coastal pattern marked by scar- city of painted wares and almost complete lack of tripod supports, apparently introduced clay stamps, masks, stirrup-spouts, al fresco paint, and so-called Olmec in- fluence in figurines, design, and style. Tlatilco mate- rial, although showing enough affinities with the latter part of Middle Zacatenco to be partly contemporaneous, is in part peculiarly unique and therefore probably con- tinued for a time unrivaled in the Valley of Mexico, thus bridging a gap recognized by Vaillant as breaking the continuity between Middle and Late Zacatenco (Vaillant, 1941: 38). The remains of the Late Zacatenco or Early Ticomtan people constitute the first phase of what is commonly referred to as the Cuicuilco-Ticom'an Period of the Late Archaic or Formative Horizon. This in turn presents three developmental stages, the last of which provides a thread of culture history that ties to Chupicuaro. Early Ticom'an finds bear little resemblance to their Tlatilco predecessors and although the Ticomanos car- ried on the manufacture of clay stamps, and some Olmec influence is shown by their 13 figurine type (Vail- lant, 1931: 259; Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 50; Porter, 1953: 32), the ceramic tradition reverted to the tripod support and painted decoration of the Zacatenco-El Arbolillo Periods. Although no Ticomtan pottery con- temporaneous with that of Tlatilco has been found in the Valley of Mexico, both appear simultaneously in the State of Morelos. Early Ticom'an is characterized by El, E2, E3, and 13 figurines (Vaillant, 1931: 330). White ware was common, red-on-buff incised pottery and ollas were plentiful. Solid disc-shaped earplugs were an innovation, replacing the napkin-ring type. Obsidian points were more elaborate, made with a simple tang. Objects of jade and shell were more plentiful, the latter mostly from the east coast. Intermediate Ticom'an yielded figurines of types Gi and G2, I1 and I2 and L. Rare types were E4, J, M, and N (Vaillant, 1931: 330-331). Of particular in- terest as regards Chupicuaro was the introduction of polychrome ware. The red-on-buff wares became poly- chrome by outlining the red areas by white lines (Vail- lant, 1931: 333). This is essentially the way the red variant of black polychrome was executed at Chupi- cuaro, except that black paint was used instead of white. The resemblances stop there, however, and do not carry through to design or style. This Ticom'an phase yielded swollen and bulbous vessel supports and the use of sup- ports became increasingly popular. Late Ticom'an produced the H figurine types (Vail- lant, 1931: 331), of which H4 is the most common fig- urine of Chupicuaro. This has been discussed as the slant-eye type in an attempt to replace letters and nu- merals by a descriptive term. The type is the same. Vessel supports were numerous at Ticom'an and pre- sented swollen, elongated, or zoomorphic forms. Ear- plugs were of a new design. One end of a napkin-ring plug was closed and carved. Obsidian points were carefully tanged by making side notches and negative painting appeared as a new decorative technique. It is now time to return to Chupicuaro. The earli- est phase there can be correlated precisely with Late Ticom'an of the Valley of Mexico. Not only is evi- dence of the initial stage of agriculture lacking at Chupicuaro, but what is indeed strange is the lack of earlier remains of the long Formative Horizon. There is no question of this being true in the immediate vicin- ity of Chupicuaro, as excavations and surface surveys have amply shown. It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that the area was not populated in early Formative times for traces of that period may yet be unearthed. THE CHUPICUARO EARLY PHASE At least two if not three phases are apparent in the Chupicuaro material. These permit some segregation of the vast amount of ceramic finds and so aid in defi- nition of certain cultural changes. It should be stressed again that the whole Chupicuaro occupation shows no drastic or sudden changes, but constitutes one long pe- riod with minor variations of painted pottery decoration, style and color. BUILDINGS The Early Phase is known through 141 burials, 8 caches, and 13 isolated or floating vessels. Little can be said concerning constructions during this phase although the beginning of ceremonial structures might be expected. The pyramid of Cuicuilco in the Valley of Mexico dates from this time and it is probable that some type of simple building was done by the Chupi- cuarefios. To date, however, no formal structures have been uncovered. Many finds of burned adobe frag- ments suggest floors or walls and one of these (fig. 27, y) shows a simple decorative grooving. The stone alignments of Pit 40 show definite planning although no suggestion can be offered as to their purpose and there is no way of telling to which chronological phase they belong. The drain which ran through Pits 112, 113, and 114 was the best example of stone masonry found. Since Early Phase graves were found in those pits, the drain must have been made either prior to or during this time. No traces were found of living quarters or refuse</page><page sequence="57">570 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. deposits, but people probably lived in simple huts, per- haps in good-sized communities judging by the large cemetery with abundant standardized ceramic remains. Standardization itself suggests mass production de- signed to meet a large demand in minimum time. BURIALS Dead were simply interred in the ground without any pretense of lining the pit with stones or marking the grave. The preferred burial ground in the vicinity was along the top of El Rayo hill, where graves of men, women, and children were found in addition to those of dogs. The burial pattern seems to have remained the same throughout all phases. The dead were placed at a depth varying from .50 to 2.50 meters and many were scattered around a fire pit known as a tlecuil. This was a rectangular receptacle with sides of packed clay, and, as a rule, it was made above the level of a group of burials, although some were entirely isolated. The exact purpose of the tlecuiles is not known, but, since all contained fine ash and bits of charcoal, some type of ceremonial fire probably formed part of the funeral services. Artificial head deformation was practiced by occipital flattening. Burials of severed skulls were common. Evidently decapitation was not considered degrading since many of these skulls were accompanied by abun- dant pottery. Only two trophy skulls were found in Early Phase graves. Unusual was Burial 275, which yielded a skeleton whose skull had been horizontally severed above the ears, only the lower part of the cranium remaining intact. Fragments of a cut skull were found as part of the offering, but these were too poorly preserved to ascertain whether they had be- longed to the same skeleton. Four cut skulls were stacked on the knees of a skeleton (Burial 25, Early Phase). Horizontally severed brain cases usually had two lateral perforations near the rim, probably for sus- pension. Many were painted red. This suggests that they served some useful purpose, perhaps as containers. Preoccupation with skulls and death is typically Meso- american. The body in this Early Phase was usually extended on the back. Liberal offerings were placed with the dead, either at the head or feet, or if abundant scattered around the deceased. Children were given most of the jewelry and musical instruments. Figurines were equally distributed among adults and children. It is doubtful, therefore, that these objects were used as toys. Stone implements were found with adults. POTTERY Pottery in both Early and Late Phases included black ware and painted types. Black ware is at least three times as plentiful in the Early as in the Late Phase. The forms show considerable standardization. These are characterized by a sharp shoulder near the rim, on the body, or at the base of the vessel. A simple incised design often decorates the horizontal shoulder, but in- cising is of secondary importance to form. Variations of these shouldered vessels result from an elongation of the receptacle or addition of tripod support. Other forms include tecomates, ollas, plain bowls, a few un- usual tripod vessels, ring stand, pedestal base, shoe- shapes, and effigy vessels, the last representing dogs, birds, a turtle, and conventionalized forms. The most common method of depicting animals on bowls was by rim tabs. Standardization is apparent also in decoration. Aside from effigy vessels, few forms are unique. Incising, fil- leting, and fluting are reduced to a minimum. Incising never consists of more than a few simply arranged par- allel lines or notches. Considering next the painted wares: in the Early Phase these consist of red-rimmed, red ware, red-on- buff, black and red, and black polychrome. Of these, only red ware and red-on-buff types continue into the Late Phase. Red-rimmed ware is represented by a small lot, form being restricted to ollas, tecomates, bowls, shoe-shapes, and pedestal base. Red paint decorates rims, handles, and tab appendages. Some specimens are fired as dark as black ware; others are a uniform cream color set off by polished red decoration. The only noteworthy dec- orative motif is that of red hands. Although many specimens cannot be chronologically placed, this decora- tion appears to be restricted to the Early Phase, and therefore may be valuable as a local time-marker. Red ware is also a subordinate painted ware type but is quite evenly distributed in both Early and Late Phases. Most or all of the vessel was slipped in red. Forms consist of ollas, tecomates, bowls, pedestal bases, spider-leg and other tripod supports and effigy vessels. Red paint is the most decorative feature, being polished to a rich luster. Additional ornamentation consists of bosses, rim points, and occasional fluting. The only possible trade vessel of Early date is the light colored red tripod from Burial 275 (fig. 9, 1). Red-on-buff is the most abundant painted ware, about equally distributed between Early and Late Phases. A wide variety of forms include ollas, open and rimmed bowls, oval and canoe shapes, tecomates, spider-leg and other tripods, pedestal base and effigy vessels. Of these, the spider-leg and open bowls are particularly abundant in the Early Phase. Red may form either the design or the background for a buff motif. Spider-leg tripods are especially numerous, making up about half of all red-on-buff Early specimens. Black-and-red pottery is represented by only seven- teen vessels and is an Early Phase marker. Consider- ing the number of samples, the variety of form is con- siderable, including ollas, cylinders, tecomates, tripods, pedestal base and effigy vessels. However, tripods and cylinders are the most numerous. Decoration is of ne- cessity simple since the technique is rather laborious.</page><page sequence="58">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION 571 The vessel was decorated as red-on-buff, exposing a small buff-colored motif later filled with black paint. The effect is that of a black-on-red vessel since none of the buff-colored base is exposed. The abundant black polychrome pottery is one of the best Early Phase markers. Numerically it is sec- ond only to red-on-buff. There is great variety of form, especially among the bowls and tripods. Other shapes include ollas, tetrapods, pedestal bases, shoe- shape and effigy vessels. These tetrapods were the only four-legged vessels found at Chupicuaro. Red-on-buff patterns were copied but, in addition, several distinct styles can be recognized. A special red variant consists of small buff-colored motifs outlined by black lines; others include a wide red band outlined in black, and black-on-buff winged motifs. FIGURINES Figurines were abundant in Early Phase material, occurring in burials, caches, and as sporadic fragments in the vicinity. The slant-eye type and its variations were the only figurines. Most characteristic is the flat, thin body with a large heart-shaped head which curves backwards. Filleted features show a characteristic slanted eye and a long nose reaching down to the chin. Elaborate hair styles, necklaces, and bracelets adorn the figurine. Clothing is scarce. Men are shown wearing a loin-cloth, foot gear, and a leg ornament, and the hair is not parted in the middle as it is in female figurines. The best preserved specimens are still sparsely painted red, white, and black. Special figurines of this type may be fat, have cusp feet or rep- resent pregnant women. Variant figurine styles which I believe to be closely related to this major group are squint-eye and button-eye types. The first is large; the other type, of which no complete specimen was found, is small and not represented in burials or caches. Similar slant-eye figurines were found by Vaillant in the Valley of Mexico and constituted his H4 type, pertaining to the Late Ticom'an Period (Vaillant, 1935: 300). He was quick to recognize their Chupicuaro affiliations. They are not common in central Mexico, but a few were found at Ticom'an, San Angel (Boas, 1921: pl. 52, 53), Cuicuilco and as far north as San Juan del Rio, Queretaro (Vaillant, 1935: 363). On exhibit at Acolm'an are twelve figurines reportedly found at nearby Cuanal'an with typical Ticom'an III pottery. These slant-eye figurines serve as excellent diagnostics for the Chupicuaro Early Phase, relating it to the Late Ticom'an Period of the Valley of Mexico. MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS Few other objects have chronological significance. In many instances, paucity of samples makes it haz- ardous to estimate their distribution in time. Proceed- ing with caution, however, we can be sure that certain of these artifacts were used during the Early Phase. Ocarinas, a few rattles, the only flute, all datable bone rasps, and crescent-shaped shell ornaments, can be as- signed to the Early Phase. Distribution of obsidian, shell, and bone is quite uniform throughout. These objects were utilitarian and therefore would be less likely to reflect minor changes in artistic styles. The plumb-bobs appeared in burials of Early and Transi- tional date. SUM MARY The Early Phase at Chupicuaro shows such Meso- american Formative features as tripod vessels, painted wares, hand-modeled figurines, and some type of clay surfaced structures and stone alignments. Diagnostic Early features include: use of black paint on pottery (either black and red or black polychrome), the slant- eye figurine with several variations, clay earplugs, espe- cially a napkin-ring form closed at one end, and carved, red-rimmed pottery. Other elements possibly restricted to this phase include flutes, bone rasps, crescent-shaped shell ornaments and stone plumb-bobs. Burials were usually extended on the back. Conspicuously absent are jade, al fresco decoration, negative painting, white ware, and spouted vessels (with exception of stirrup-spout illustrated, fig. 12, s). EXTERIOR RELATIONSHIPS Direct or indirect contact with the Valley of Mexico was sufficiently close to make possible correlation of Early Chupicuaro with Ticoman III, Cerro del Tepal- cate, Cuicuilco, and Teotihuacan I. The probable over- lap of Ticom'an III and Teotihuacan I has been pointed out by Noguera (1943: 43) and Vaillant (1938: 541). The presence of painted sherds from Cerro del Tepal- cate which are indistinguishable from Chupicuaro types, makes some connection between the two areas undeni- able. Rim sherds of the red-on-buff spider-leg type A at Cerro del Tepalcate attest to the presence of this un- usual form in the Valley of Mexico. Black polychrome sherds further reinforce the relationship. Black ware forms resemble Ticom'an III types in having composite silhouettes and conical tripod supports. The general appearance of this pottery greatly resembles Valley of Mexico unpainted wares. Early black-ware vessels are indistinguishable from Late ones at Chupicuaro, so that this pottery does not aid in discerning phase differences. Perhaps the most obvious link lies in the H4 or slant- eye figurine type, dominant at Chupicuaro and known from various sites in the Valley of Mexico and State of Morelos. Noguera (1935) has pointed out west Mexican in- fluence in Teotihuacan I, but Vaillant was more cau- tious as to how these resemblances may have come about. He believed that the evidence supported some relationship between the two areas, but suggested that west Mexico could have been influenced by an earlier Cuicuilco-Ticom'an effusion. The presence in Teoti- huacan I deposits of Pacific Coast shells, negative paint-</page><page sequence="59">572 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. ing, and figurine types was considered at that time to indicate west Mexican origin. Noguera seems to at- tribute much, though not all, of this foreign influence to Chupicuaro (Noguera, 1935: 62-64). If the west Mexican influence at Teotihuacan stemmed from Chupicuaro it cannot have involved the introduction of negative painting, because although this technique was employed at both Ticom'an and Teotihuac'an (Noguera, 1935: 7), it is completely lack- ing among sherds or vessels from Chupicuaro. This strongly suggests a one-way influence, from west to east; otherwise negative painting would almost surely have taken hold at Chupicuaro. This, of course, is a common dilemma, for it is difficult to judge just why some elements diffuse to a culture and others are re- jected. Perhaps the Chupicuarefios did not care for the artistic effect of negative painting and preferred their well-defined lines in bold colors; in any event, their reserved-space technique was closely related to negative painting. The lack of al fresco decoration at Chupicuaro also suggests that Teotihuacan culture was not spreading westward at this time. Sherds of this type were found in the Pyramid of the Sun (Noguera, 1935: 17). On the other hand, sherds indistinguishable from Chupi- cuaro types have been recovered at Cerro del Tepalcate, whereas no pottery at Chupicuaro can definitely be at- tributed to a source in the Valley of Mexico. These facts, together with the notable absence at Chupicuaro of negative and al fresco painting, strongly suggest that at least during the Early Phase of Chupicuaro, the re- semblances between the two regions resulted from a west-to-east movement. It will be recalled that although Chupicuaro is included with west Mexico, it is rela- tively close to Tula, Hidalgo, and the distance to the Valley of Mexico is not great. Certainly Chupicuaro influence was not of lasting ef- fect in the Valley of Mexico for none of the subsequent polychrome or painted styles found there show any re- semblance to the elaborate local types so popular on the Lerma River. The same fate befell the Chupicuaro fig- urines. But it must be remembered that Teotihuacan was soon to become the all-important Mesoamerican ceremonial center of Classic times, and in these early periods it must have been rapidly developing and in all likelihood, west Mexican influence was only one of many to which the Teotihuacanos found themselves exposed. Carbon 14 analysis has provided several dates for this Late Preclassic or Formative Horizon, all of which are in rather close agreement.7 The Cuicuilco date is 470 B.C. + 250 as compared to 613 B.C. + 200 for the Cerro del Tepalcate and 482 B.C. for the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan (Johnson, 1951: 8). Actually 7Only one date from the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan is cited here. Actually two are reported (Johnson, 1951: 8), the other A.D. 434. The above date of 482 B.C. is compatible with archaeological guess dates. these three dates agree remarkably well with archaeo- logical estimates. Hence, the Early Phase of Chupi- cuaro can probably be dated somewhere between 500 B.C. and A.D. 300, since the end of the Formative Pe- riod in Mesoamerica is usually judged to have taken place about that time (Armillas, 1948a: 116; Bernal, 1950: 55 if). Eight hundred years may be too long for the production of the Early Phase material pre- sented here, but does not seem excessive if time is al- lowed for the development of this complex. THE CHUPICUARO TRANSITIONAL PHASE This is a poorly represented phase during which some features of the Early Phase vanished from Chupicuaro and new elements of the Late Phase began to appear. This Transitional Phase is represented by fifteen burials presenting features of both the preceding and following phases. Burial customs and many pottery forms and decorations continued without a break. We know little of this phase other than the fact that it represents an overlapping of Early and Late material. There are no elements restricted to these few burials. The phase is so meagerly represented that nothing can be said re- garding its duration or exterior relationships. THE CHUPICUARO LATE PHASE Late Phase material consists of seventy-two burials, three caches and six isolated vessels. In many respects there is no apparent change from the Early Phase and without a doubt the Chupicuarefios lived much as they had before and continued to bury their dead in the same manner with many vessels of similar types and decora- tion. The Late material from Chupicuaro shows that some former styles and techniques had completely dis- appeared and were replaced by new ones. BUILDINGS AND BURIALS Regarding adobe or stone construction, nothing more can be added. Since the same area was used for a burial ground, fragments of burned adobe floors or walls were mixed throughout the soil and could not be segregated by phase. Burials appear to have been more dispersed at this time and were located slightly to the north and south of the earlier main center which was still employed to some extent, although it may have become overcrowded, forcing the use of adjacent plots. The burial pattern was essentially the same. Tle- cuiles were just as frequent and many of them marked the center of a group of graves. Both rectangular and round tlecuiles were made. In two instances, a Late grave was found directly below a tlecuil so that asso- ciation cannot be questioned. Trophy skulls, decapi- tation skulls, and cut brain cases were also found, al- though in reduced numbers. The custom of extending the dead was less rigidly adhered to and positions were more varied. The number of ventral extended skele- tons increased. Most offerings were concentrated at the feet or scattered about the body.</page><page sequence="60">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION 573 POTTERY Black ware occurs in Late Phase burials but seems to have suffered a sharp decline in quantity. In the Early Phase there were 325 painted vessels compared with 218 black ware specimens; in the Late Phase the ratio was 141 to 58, showing a sharp decrease in un- painted types. Form and decoration remained un- changed with the exception of the pedestal base and ring-stand which disappeared. Painted ware groups include red-on-buff, red ware, brown-on-red, and brown polychrome. Apparently red- on-buff and red ware changed little and such modifica- tions as there were involved only minor features such as slight change in color or design. These may appear to be very fine points but they are differences I believe to be indicative of chronological change. Generally, design motifs are larger, with a more even balance of design in proportion to background area. Lines are often thicker and bolder in execution. The simple cross motif is strictly a Late design. The most notable change in vessel form is the marked rise in elliptical or oval- shape and canoes. This holds true for all painted ware groups in the Late Phase. Oval-shaped vessels are usually painted with broad stripes which converge at the sides or ends, suggesting a fruit or vegetable form. Tripods and open bowls decreased in number, while ollas and tecomates increased. No ring-stand or ped- estal base can be allocated to the Late Phase although only a few black ware specimens could be dated. It seems best, therefore, to consider the presence of these forms doubtful during this period. The red-on-buff ring-shaped vessel belongs to this phase. The isolated effigy specimen, painted and incised, may be a trade piece (fig. 12, m). I note too that in the case of red ware the paint tends to be yellower, verging on orange. Some of the vessels of this type may be imports. One of the main diagnostic changes was the replace- ment of black paint by brown or dark red. The brown- on-red vessels, although numbering only two, show that the technique of painting had been greatly simplified. Instead of filling a reserved-space pattern with black, brown was easily and quickly applied over a red slip. The result was almost the same, but the brown paint feels raised to the touch, unlike the paint on black-and- red specimens. Here is an important new feature of Late Phase ceramics, the tendency to speed up produc- tion by turning out a more easily made article. Stand- ardization was noted in the Early Phase as indeed it is characteristic of all Chupicuaro culture, but certainly this was more commonly practiced in the Late Phase. Brown polychrome is essentially the same type dec- oration found on the earlier black, but there is nothing comparable to the special red variant. There is less variety and motifs are simple, made in plenty of space and often with a thick stroke. Speed was not gained at the cost of neatness or precision, but by using less complicated designs. FIGURINES Perhaps the most startling change is revealed by com- parison of figurine types. Diagnostic of the Late Phase is the choker figurine. Marked differences from the earlier slant-eye type include: a long and narrow fig- urine with flat back and rounded front surface, no curvature to the head, less clean-cut and sometimes blurred features. Slant-eye figurines were modeled free-hand, whereas the choker types were manufactured by pressing them against a back-board as support. Characteristic is the wide choker necklace which joins head to body. Groups of tiny clay pellets often adorn the shoulder, a decoration unparalleled in slant-eye fig- urines. The fine ivory variant, the finest of Late Phase figurines, having a smooth finish and high polish, was probably hand-modeled without using a back-board. Men, women, and children are represented in the choker figurines. Curious too are the beds containing a pros- trate figure which may be accompanied by a person or bird. Those figurines classed as crude type are also of Late date. These may be related to the choker figurine. The prognathic figurines, although not abundant, clearly form a distinctive group. They are reddish in color, show less filleting and use incision for indicating features. The wide choker necklaces indicate local manufacture, but the three-faceted face with marked prognathism shows undeniable affinities to Vaillant's E2 figurine and they also bear a notable resemblance, except for the absence in E2 of a choker, to illustrated specimens (Noguera, 1935: 31; Vaillant, 1930: 131 and 1931: 347). This E2 figurine has a wide distribution in the Valley of Mexico and shows connections with types from Jalapazco, Puebla, and Teotihuac'an (Vail- lant, 1931: 347). Indeed, Vaillant lists it as one evi- dence of the overlap of Cuicuilco-Ticoman and Teoti- huacan cultures (Vaillant, 1935: 302). Careful com- parison between Valley of Mexico and Chupicuaro types shows that the latter are more fully developed and have greater elaboration. Bodies are plumper and more carefully modeled. Resemblances lie largely in the pe- culiarly shaped head, incised nose and mouth, details of headdress, and body shape in general. To my knowl- edge these figurines are not found in the Valley of Mexico in horizons later than Teotihuacan I. The four figurines found in Burial 221 (fig. 19, f-n) I consider foreign products because they are of reddish clay with a white slip, the body and head are quite un- like anything else uncovered at Chupicuaro. These fig- urines, representing two couples, have characteristics of Vaillant's H5 type, but the men wear a curious head- dress found on Teotihuac'an jadeite figurines from the offering of Quetzalcoatl. The H5 figurine is reported by Vaillant as being rare at Ticoman and known also from Azcapotzalco. It is one of the most reliable Late Ticom'an markers (Vaillant, 1931: 364). For the</page><page sequence="61">574 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Quetzalcoatl offering, Armillas suggests a Teotihuacan II-III date (Armillas, 1950: 51). Here indeed is a quandary: an object of Teotihuacfan I date wearing a Teotihuacan II-III headdress! Of course the latter date must be accepted. It would be interesting to lo- cate the home of these figurines. It was not necessarily Teotihuacan but probably lay somewhere in the Valley of Mexico. Certainly, nothing suggests Chupicuaro as their place of origin. So, we may think that Mexican figurines have been greatly over-emphasized in the lit- erature, but Vaillant's minute classification of types, some of which are narrowly restricted in time, has al- ready proved a great value in establishing cross-ties in central Mexico, and certainly does so again in the case of Chupicuaro. Burial of figurines with the dead increases during the Late Phase. This custom is rare in Mesoamerica. It appears first during Tlatilco times in the Valley of Mexico, in the Gualupita I and II phases of the Valley of Morelos, and the remote area of Playa de los Muer- tos, Honduras (Porter, 1953: 66). These sites are believed to be roughly contemporaneous with each other and pre-Chupicuaro in date. I know of no figurine burial in west Mexico other than at El Opefio, Michoa- can (Noguera, 1943: 483). MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS The Late Phase compares favorably with the Early as regards clay artifacts, obsidian, shell, stone, and bone. Clay rattles seem to have increased and the handsome bird effigy specimens are Late. Shell artifacts were nearly equally distributed between the two phases. The presence of Chalcoensis shells in a Late grave assuredly indicates trade relations with the Valley of Mexico dur- ing this period, for these fresh-water clams are known only from Lake Chalco. Shell, bone, and stone imple- ments apparently remained unchanged. SUM MARY The Late Phase at Chupicuaro was probably a con- tinuation of the Early Phase with few or no changes in the basic pattern of living; it was, however, marked by increased exterior relationships. The local culture was characterized by brown paint on pottery (either brown-on-red or brown polychrome) and a general tendency to simplify decorative techniques. Tripods and open bowls decrease in number, while ring- stands and pedestal bases are only doubtfully present. Ollas and tecomates are more numerous and special in- terest was devoted to canoe and oval-shaped vessels. The cross motif is strictly a Late design. Figurines show a marked change. Diagnostics in- clude the choker, crude prognathic and trade types. A new method of manufacturing figurines by use of a back-board reflects the trend seen in pottery towards speed and mass production. EXTERIOR RELATIONSHIPS Increased exterior relationships are suggested by sev- eral traded vessels, possibly from farther west. Simi- lar vessels are known from Jacona and Purepero but unfortunately these cannot be dated. My own opinion is that more Chupicuaro-like material will be forthcom- ing from north-central Mexico. Little has been done in this vast region and Margain (1944: 146) and No- guera (1930: 71) have only pointed out the presence of red-on-buff pottery and "Tarascan" affiliations. Red- on-buff pottery runs through Mesoamerican cultures from Zacatenco to the Mazap'an horizon and only very specific resemblances in wares, finish, and decoration would make comparisons possible. Chupicuaro pottery was long considered to be "Tarascan" but from No- guera and Margain's papers, such Tarascan affinities as appear in north-central Mexico seem to be with the much later true Tarascan material found at Tzintzunt- zan. Nevertheless, the two specimens attributed to La Quemada and illustrated by Batres (1903: pl. 27) are without question of Chupicuaro origin. The prove- nience of these may be questioned, since Armillas has informed me that he saw none of this type ware during his visit to La Quemada in 1952. Important affiliations are seen with the Valley of Mexico figurine types. There is no way of knowing at what time the red-on-buff tecomate from Chupicuaro, illustrated by Linne (1942: 178, fig. 319), found its way to Teotihuac'an, but it could have taken place dur- ing either phase. Brown polychrome sherds have also been retrieved at Cerro del Tepalcate, although few in number and never with graves. Vaillant (1931: 290, 387, and Vaillant and Vaillant, 1934: 83) reports Chu- picuaro trade sherds at Gualupita and Ticoman, but it is not always clear whether these are of brown or black polychrome. Chronologically the Late Phase of Chuplcuaro prob- ably correlates roughly with Teotihuacan II. Although the E2 or prognathic figurine is of Teotihuacan I date in the Valley of Mexico, the Chupicuaro type is more developed and was restricted to the Late Phase. The four H5 trade figurines further support a date later than Teotihuacan I because of their Classic style head- dress. The local sequence at Chupicuaro equates the Early Phase with Ticom'an III-Teotihuacan I and the Late material is clearly of more recent origin. I can see no basis for postulating earlier correlations. EPILOGUE Teotihuacan II was probably a period of relatively short duration, lasting roughly from A.D. 300 to 400 or 500 (Bernal, 1950: 52 ff; Armillas, 1948: 116), thus falling into the Classic or Florescent Period. So far, no evidence of a great Classic Period as such (Armillas, 1948: 106-108) is recognizable in the Chupicuaro area. More likely Chupicuaro lagged behind with its very spe-</page><page sequence="62">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION 575 cialized pattern of pottery vessels and figurines, and, although roughly contemporaneous with the great con- structions in the Valley of Mexico, it never achieved such heights itself. Indeed about the time one might expect to find manifestations of a truly Classic Period on the Lerma River, the story breaks off completely. What happened at Chupicuaro during this great cul- tural flowering in Mesoamerica is not known. Perhaps the Chupicuarefios moved away; certainly they were not overrun by newcomers for there are no remains of Classic occupation. Still later, however, this Lerma River region was re-occupied, at least sporadically, dur- ing the Mazapan or Toltec Period. The handled in- cense burner with two rattle supports reported by us (Estrada and Porter, 1945: 7, fig. 19) undoubtedly belongs to this period. Although fragments of similar specimens were found at Xolalpan (Linne, 1934: 111), most are later. They are known from Las Flores in the Huasteca (Period V, Ekholm, 1944: 402, fig. 25, g), from the Mixteca and Cerro Montoso (Linne, 1934: 11). Caso (1938: fig. 49) illustrates a similar vessel from Monte Alban, Mixteca Period. The pipe stem (fig. 21, s) found during the excavation of the Solis Dam is typical of pipes from Tula, Hidalgo. These ob- jects are unknown prior to this period in Mesoamerica (Porter, 1948: 217). The Mazapan head (fig. 20, a) was picked up on the surface of the ground at Chupi- cuaro by one of our workmen. In addition, several red- on-buff tripod vessels were uncovered during the exca- vations for the Solis Dam. These were unlike Chupi- cuaro specimens, being thin walled with short teat-like supports. Although no copper has been reported in the immediate vicinity of Chupicuaro, various groups of copper bells in the museum of Morelia are attributed to the Ac'ambaro area. These, of course, may also be of still later date. The finds show, however, that the area was occupied by people with Toltec Culture. It is pri- marily their remains that were found with the burials of El Bartolillo at nearby Zinapecuaro, Michoacan (Moedano, 1946). This concludes the fragmentary culture history of Chupicuaro. The culture did not bloom suddenly, nor was its end abrupt. Correlations with the Valley of Mexico provide only a general framework, an anchor in time. Periods and phases serve only to facilitate handling of material. Our excavations have yielded much information about the Chupicuaro people; they have shown that they lived during Late Formative and Early Classic times but they have failed to tell where they came from or what led to their elaborate poly- chrome art. Fortunately the archaeologist is never satisfied. Al- ways he hopes for new finds which will shed additional light on the problems of culture history. There is ur- gent need for further excavations on all sides of Chupi- cuaro and in particular in the region separating it from the Valley of Mexico, as well as in the relatively un- explored country to the north.</page><page sequence="63">APPENDIX PETROGRAPHIC NOTES ON TEMPERS OF POTTERY FROM CHUPICUARO, CERRO DEL TEPALCATE AND TICOMAN, MEXICO HOWEL WILLIAMS In her account of pottery from Kaminaljuyiu, Guate- mala, Dr. Anna 0. Shepard distinguished between tem- pers composed of "ash" and those composed of "volcanic sand." The term "ash" was used for material consisting chiefly of irregular fragments of volcanic glass, with only a slight admixture of crystals. "Volcanic sand," on the other hand, was used to designate tempers made of unweathered and unabraded mineral grains of volcanic origin, mixed with a lesser amount of glassy debris. In the notes that follow, the classification of pyro- clastic rocks suggested by Wentworth and Williams is employed. According to this scheme, all the tempers to be described are volcanic ashes, because the fragment size is less than 4 mm. If 75 per cent or more of the particles consist of volcanic glass of juvenile origin, the ash is said to be vitric. If the content of such particles is between 50 and 75 per cent of the volume, and the remainder is composed of crystals, the ash is called vitric-crystal; if 25 to 50 per cent is glass and the rest crystals, the ash is crystal-vitric; and if less than 25 per cent is glass and the remainder crystals, the ash is called crystal ash. Finally, if material is dominantly composed of stony detritus, that is to say of volcanic fragments that were already solid prior to eruption, the ash is best called lithic. According to this scheme, the "volcanic sand" tem- pers of Dr. Shepard are crystal ashes, and her "ash" tempers belong to our category of vitric ashes. On the same basis, all the tempers about to be described are either crystal ashes or crystal-lithic ashes, for in none does the content of vitric fragments exceed 25 per cent of the total volume. Neither in the tempers described by Dr. Shepard nor in those presently to be discussed do any of the constituents exhibit signs of abrasion by running water. Presumably all of the materials were derived from deposits of ash laid down directly from the air by volcanic showers, or, if any were subsequently rearranged by running water, the distance of transport must have been small. It is not merely conceivable, but not at all unlikely, that all of the tempering materials from Chupicuaro, Ticom'an, and El Tepalcate were derived from the prod- ucts of either a single volcanic eruption or a quick suc- cession of eruptions of rhyolitic or dacitic character. Admittedly, some tempers are much richer than others in bits of pumice and chips of obsidian, and in a few tempers crystals and lithic fragments are present to the exclusion of pumice. But all are characterized by plen- tiful quartz, by plagioclase of almost uniform composi- tion, and by sanidine, while among the dark minerals hornblende and biotite invariably predominate, augite and hypersthene being quite subordinate. Olivine is completely absent. In addition, although the texture of the pumice fragments varies a little, their refractive indices are so nearly alike as to indicate derivation from magma of essentially the same composition. The same uniformity typifies the lithic fragments, whether of ob- sidian, spherulitic rhyolite, or andesite. Besides, almost all of the pumiceous and glassy shards are perfectly fresh, and there is no hint of incipient alteration of any of the crystals. Consequently, all of the ash must be of geologically Recent origin. Variations in content of glassy, stony, and crystal fragments are only to be expected among volcanic ejecta. Obeying the dictates of gravity, the heavier and larger fragments fall first and closest to the source. Hence, both lateral and vertical variations are typical of ash-deposits, and in the course of a short-lived vol- canic episode, repeated eruptions may lead to repeti- tion of gravity-sorted layers. And, once laid down, ejecta may be reassorted by winds and streams. These features, obvious as they are, merit attention in the present connection, for they may well account for the differences in the relative amounts of pumice, crystals, and lithic chips observed in the tempers, even though all may have been derived from the products of a single eruptive cycle. Careful field work in the Valley of Mexico and ad- jacent areas is needed to discover the source and dis- tribution of the ash in question. Tentatively, we may suggest, simply on the basis of microscopic studies, that the ash is so fresh as to imply a surficial or near- surface blanket laid down probably in postglacial times. But the precise volcano from which the ash was ex- pelled cannot be told without more knowledge of the petrographic characters of the young volcanic rocks of the region. Recent eruptions of rhyolitic and dacitic ash have certainly been few; hence, it should not be difficult to trace the ash blanket to its source. Perhaps search should be directed first toward the volcano of Nevado de Toluca. If, as we think, the consanguinity of the ashes denotes that the tempering materials came from a single blanket of ejecta, then the people who made the pottery in ques- tion could have secured their needs in many places within a very wide area. Possibly all of them found what they wanted close at hand. Certainly the nature of the tempers neither proves nor disproves interchange of wares. The absence of any tempers composed of either ba- saltic or andesitic ash is surprising in view of the abun- dance of such ejecta in and near the Valley of Mexico. Finally, it should be noted that none of the tempers 576</page><page sequence="64">VOL. 46, PT. 5, 1956] PETROGRAPHIC NOTES ON TEMPERS OF POTTERY 577 to be described below contains calcite, though, as Dr. Shepard has shown, some shards from Teotihuacan are characterized by "lumps of crypto-crystalline calcite" mixed with volcanic ash. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEMPERS 1. CHUPICUARO No. 1 (Thin black). Crystal-lithic ash Mainly composed of crystals, measuring up to 1 mm. long. Dominant among thesie, by far, are angular chips of quartz and plagioclase, which are present in approx- imately equal amounts. The plagioclase ranges in com- position from basic oligoclase to acid andesine, and much of it shows strong oscillatory zoning. Sanidine is rare. Among the dark minerals, none of which ex- ceeds 0.1 mm. in length, and together total only 2 per cent by volume, hornblende is the chief. Some crystals are greenish; others are reddish brown oxyhornblendes with extinction angles of less than 10?. Whether these oxyhornblendes are original constituents of the ash or were produced by artificial heating of the green horn- blende is uncertain. The few flakes of biotite accom- panying the hornblende also exhibit reddening. Minor constituents are pale green to colorless diopsidic augite and specks of magnetite. The temper is rich in lithic chips, some of them 2 mm. across. Most of these are banded obsidians, in part still glassy and in part devitrified to dense cryptofelsite. In a few there are fans of tridymite. Other lithic chips are composed of beautifully spherulitic rhyolite and of pilotaxitic pyroxene andesites. One chip is wholly com- posed of banded opal, 0.5 mm. across. Pumiceous glass fragments and arcuate splinters of volcanic glass, common in many other tempers, are lack- ing. Essentially, therefore, the temper is a hornblende rhyolite or dacite crystal-lithic ash. No. 2 (Thin, buff). Crystal ash This is a finer grained temper. Few crystals exceed 0.5 mm. in length, and most measure less than 0.25 mm. The temper is further distinguished from the preceding one in containing much more biotite and a little hypers- thene. Moreover, it lacks chips of obsidian, and carries a few splinters and cellular bits of clear glass. In order of abundance, the constituent minerals are as follows: zoned, acid plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, hornblende, biotite, hypersthene, augite, and magnetite. Some of the hornblendes and biotites have been red- dened, perhaps by firing of the temper. The glass shards and pumiceous chips are perfectly fresh, and their refractive indices signify a rhyolitic or dacitic com- position. A few minute fragments of andesite and dacite are the only lithic elements. No. 4 (Thick, plain red). Crystal ash Characterized by abundant quartz crystals, up to 1 mm. long, by less plagioclase than in the preceding wares, and by rare sanidines. Ferromagnesian minerals are restricted to a very few minute crystals of biotite, hornblende, and pyroxene, together making up only about 2 per cent of the whole. Quartz, on the contrary, makes up fully half the volume, and feldspars about 35 per cent. Lithic chips of fresh, banded, rhyolitic ob- sidian, and of devitrified rhyolite total 8 per cent of the bulk; crescentic shards of clear glass and occasional bits of cellular and shredded pumice constitute about 5 per cent. No. 5 (Thick, red-and-black on buff). Crystal ash Medium-grained temper; few fragments more than 0.25 mm. in maximum dimension, but one lithic chip and one hornblende crystal reach a length of 1 mm. Essentially like temper No. 2, but with slightly more ferromagnesian minerals. In order of abundance, these are biotite, hornblende, hypersthene, and augite. Among the colorless minerals, the order is acid plagioclase, quartz, and rare sanidine. Minute lithic chips of pyrox- ene andesite and rhyolitic obsidian make up a few per cent of the total; one chip consists wholly of tridymite fans. Arcuate splinters of rhyolitic glass and fewer of cellular pumice together comprise approximately 3 per cent. No. 6 (Red-on-buff). Crystal ash Virtually identical with No. 5, both in coarseness and composition. Clear chips of obsidian, wisps of glass, and fragments of pumice, some with spherical and oth- ers with tubular vesicles, total about 5 per cent of the whole. Much of the biotite is distinctly reddened, per- haps by firing. No. 7 (Thick, brown polychrome). Crystal ash Fragments up to 0.75 mm. Quartz is far more plen- tiful than plagioclase, and sanidine, as usual, is quite rare. Dark minerals are confined to a few small horn- blendes, biotites, and magnetites. Bits of clear obsidian, devitrified and spherulitic rhyolites, and occasional pieces of andesite are the lithic constituents. Cellular pumice is fairly abundant, but arcuate shards of glass are exceptional. No. 9 (Thick, black polychrome). Coarse crystal ash Both the lithic and crystal chips attain a maximum length of 1.5 mm. The approximate content is as fol- lows: quartz, 45 per cent; plagioclase, 20; sanidine, 5; ferromagnesian minerals, 3; obsidian chips, 10; ande- sitic chips, 2; cellular pumice, 15. No. 11 (Thick, black polychrome). Coarse crystal ash Hardly to be distingished from No. 9. Quartz is by far the main constituent; plagioclase is slightly more common and sanidine less so than in No. 9. The larg- est fragments measure 1 mm. Obsidian chips and bits of pumice with spherical vesicles are of the same size</page><page sequence="65">578 PORTER: EXCAVATIONS AT CHUPICUARO [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. and abundance as in No. 9; hornblende and biotite are equally scarce. No. 12 (Thin, black polychrome). Coarse crystal ash Except for the paucity of pumice fragments, this temper differs only in minor features from the tempers of Nos. 4, 7, 9, and 11. Quartz is the chief constituent, making up approximately 40 per cent of the whole. Plagioclase is next in abundance, and sanidine is only a minor accessory. Hornblende and biotite are some- what more plentiful, but still make up only a few per cent. Spherulitic rhyolite and clear obsidian chips are sporadic, one of them measuring 2.5 mm. across. Few of the other fragments attain 1 mm. in length. No. 13. Crystal-lithic ash This temper is characterized especially by abundance of quartz grains, up to 1 mm. across, most of which are intensely fractured. Together these constitute about 40 per cent of the whole. Next in abundance among the crystals are sanidine (15 per cent) and zoned, acid plagioclase (8 per cent). Ferromagnesian minerals are rare and small (2 per cent), consisting of a few oxy- hornblendes and hypersthenes; granules of iron ore ap- proximate 5 per cent of the bulk. Chips of lithic debris, up to 1 mm. across, make up about 25 per cent of the temper. Most of them are pyroxene andesites, but there are bits of clear obsidian and a few of spherulitic, devitrified rhyolite. Tiny, arcuate shards of colorless glass (3 per cent) and di- atoms (2 per cent) comprise the remainder. The ash is presumably rhyolitic or dacitic, in com- mon with most of the Chupicuaro tempers. 2. TICOMAN No. 18 (Medium, black). Almost pure crystal ash Differs from all of the Chupicuaro tempers in the almost complete absence of pumiceous fragments and chips of obsidian, and, more particularly, in the abun- dance of the ferromagnesian minerals, especially of hornblende, many prisms of which reach a length of 1 mm. Biotite is relatively rare, but both augite and hypersthene are common. Among the colorless min- erals, quartz is again plentiful, but it is subordinate in amount to zoned, basic oligoclase-acid andesine. Sani- dine is a minor accessory. Lithic chips are confined to a few minute fragments of pyroxene andesite. No. 19 (Thick, black). Almost pure crystal ash Essentially like No. 18. Although the proportions of the various minerals differ from those of the Chupicuaro tempers, and al- though pumice is extremely scant, the nature of both the pumice and the minerals is the same. We suggest, therefore, that the Ticom'an shards were made either from an original, gravity-sorted, crystal-rich layer of ash or from a layer in which the light constituents were mainly removed after initial deposition, perhaps by running water. If the latter interpretation be the cor- rect one, then the water transport must have been brief, for none of the fragments shows signs of abrasion. 3. CERRO DEL TEPALCATE No. 14 (Thin, black). Crystal ash with accessory lithic chips No pumice fragments were observed in thin-section, but bits of clear volcanic glass were detected in crushed samples. The temper is most like those from Ticom'an. Oscillatory zoned crystals of acid plagioclase are much in excess of quartz and sanidine combined. Hornblende is both large and plentiful, and biotite is also abundant. Augite and hypersthene, on the other hand, are scarce. A few lithic chips of andesite are present, but none of obsidian. No. 17 (Thick, black polychrome). Coarse crystal- lithic ash with abundant vitric shards Approximate composition as follows: quartz, 30 per cent; acid plagioclase, 15; sanidine, 5; ferromagnesian minerals, 1; lithic chips, 30; pumice fragments and shards of volcanic glass, 19. The crystals and pumice fragments attain maximum lengths of about 1 mm., while some of the lithic chips reach a length of 3 mm. Among the latter, the commonest type is clear obsidian exhibiting beautiful perlitic fractures; next in abundance are chips of "cryptofelsite," probably devitrified obsid- ians; then, bits of spherulitic rhyolite; and, lastly, mi- nute pieces of pyroxene andesite. Many pumice frag- ments are marked by spherical vesicles, and the juvenile glass shards show the characteristic arcuate outlines consequent upon the bursting of bubbles. The few dark minerals are, as usual, hornblende and biotite. No. 20 (Thick, black). Coarse crystal ash Typified by an abundance of crystals, several up to 2 mm. long, and paucity of pumice. The temper is also unusually rich in ferromagnesians. A rough estimate of the volume of percentages is as follows: crystals, 85; lithic fragments, 13; pumice and arcuate shards of glass, 2. Among the crystals, acid plagioclase totals 60 per cent, quartz only 5, sanidine 5, hornblende 11, augite and hypersthene 3, and biotite 1. The lithic chips are composed of devitrified obsidians and a few of pyroxene andesite. No. 22 (Very thick, red-on-buff). Medium-grained crystal ash Poor in ferromagnesian minerals and unusually rich in quartz. Maximum size of fragments, 0.8 mm. The approximate composition is as follows: quartz, 55 per cent; sanidine, 10; acid plagioclase, 4; green horn- blende, 2; biotite, less than 1; lithic chips, mostly of fresh obsidian, 10; ovoid and angular chips of pale buff glass, partly altered to an unidentified, weakly birefrin-</page><page sequence="66">A C Chupicuaro tempers A-Sherd No. 1 (Thin; black).

Coarse crystal-lithic ash Most closely resemlbles the Ticoman wares, and No. 14 from Chupicuaro. Characterized especially by an abundance of oscillatory zoned acid plagioclase and by much green and red hornblende; also by the absence of vitric fragments and of pumice. Some lithic chips at- tain a maximum length of 2 mm.; but none of the crys- tals exceeds 1 mm. The approximate content is as fol- lows: plagioclase, 55 per cent; sanidine, 5; quartz, 5; hornblende, 6; hypersthene, 2.5; augite, 0.5; biotite, less than 1; lithic fragments, mostly of pyroxene an- desite but including some devitrified rhyolites, 25. No. 27 (Red-on-buff). Medium-grained lithic-crystal ash with vitric admixture This is a unique temper. Most impressive is the abundance of ovoid and angular chips of clear, colorless obsidian, many of them showing beautiful perlitic frac- tures. Precisely similar bits of obsidians are present in much smaller amount in several other tempers, as for example in Nos. 17 and 22. With th-ie clear obsid- ians are other chips showing devitrification to "crypto- felsite," and a few marked by spherulitic textures. To- gether these lithic fragments constitute approximately half the total temper. About 4 per cent is made up of pale buff rhyolitic glass chips, like those in No. 22, and about 5 per cent consists of arcuate glass shards formed by disruption of cellular pumice. Quartz predominates by far over all the other minerals, totalling 25 per cent of the whole. Acid plagioclase makes up 10 per cent, sanidine about 5, while hornblende and biotite together comprise no more than 1 per cent of the bulk. All of the above constituents, both lithic and crystal fragments, measure less than 1 mm. across. No. 29 (Thick, blacke polychrome). Mediutm-grained crystal ash with vitric admixture Most nearly resembles Nos. 4 and 7 from Chupicuaro. Marked chiefly by abundance of quartz and scarcity of ferromagnesian minerals. The approximate percentage composition is as follows: quartz, 65; acid plagioclase, 7; sanidine, 8; hypersthene, hornblende, biotite, and augite combined, 2; granules of magnetite, 3; ovoid bits of clear, fresh obsidian, 5; cellular pumice and arcuate splinters of glass, 10. The maximum size of the frag- ments is 1 mm. SUMMARY All of the tempers may have been derived from a single layer or perhaps from a series of layers of rhyo- litic or dacitic ash deposited at or about the same time. The mineralogical constitution denotes derivation from magma of essentially uniform composition. Variations in the proportions of the crystal, vitric and lithic frag- ments are attributed to original differences resulting from the gravity sorting of falling ejecta, and to sub- sequent erosion and redeposition of some of the ash. The tempers most nearly alike are as follows: Group 1: Nos. 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 17, 20, 22, and 29. Group 2: Nos. 14, 18, 19, and 25. Group 3: Nos. 2, 5, and 6. Samples Nos. 1 and 27 are rather more distinctive, but probably of the same parentage. In addition to the 18 shards studied in thin-section under the microscope, 11 others (Nos. 3, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 28) were briefly examined in crushed samples. All appear to be essentially like those described above. There is no apparent correlation between the coarse- ness and composition of the tempers on the one hand and the thickness and designs of the shards on the other.</page><page sequence="68">REFERENCES ALVAREZ CARVAJAL, M. 1943.
