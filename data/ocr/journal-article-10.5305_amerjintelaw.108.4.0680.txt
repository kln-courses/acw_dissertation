<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> AGORA: REFLECTIONSONANTHONYD’AMATO’S “GROUNDWORK FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW” SEND BACK THE LIFEBOATS: CONFRONTING THE PROJECT OF SAVING INTERNATIONAL LAW By Jean d’Aspremont* The idea that international law is in crisis1—needing the inspired thinking and skilled prac- tice of many kinds of international lawyers to save it—has a rich history in those countries where the enterprise of international law has been most deeply established and embraced.2 Unsurprisingly, saving international law remains a project shared by many twenty-first-cen- tury international lawyers.3 Such a commitment is certainly not confined to legal academics. Even some legal advisers, counsel, judges, and activists think of themselves as having a role to play in rescuing international law. Being a disengaged bystander while grave hazards suppos- edly threaten international law has not seemed to be a proper option for many of these pro- fessionalswho share a calling for heroic self-sacrifice to salvage the ostensibly endangered entity of international law.4 Against this backdrop, Anthony D’Amato’s concept of self-preserving international law5 comes across as original and appealing. Indeed, if international law constitutes a self-preserving system as D’Amato claims, it is misguided to think that it needs saving. This response argues that the greatest merit of D’Amato’s audacious construction is that it challenges the heroic mind-set of many twenty-first-century international lawyers. Parts I and II of this piece sketch the various facets and implications of D’Amato’s self-pre- serving international law as well as highlight its originality in Anglo-American scholarship.

Part IVmakes the argument that if some self-preserving aspects exist, they are the product of the collective attitudes of the professional groups organized around inter- national law but are not intrinsic to international law itself. Because I posit that we cannot pos- siblyhave anymeta-standpoint to (in)validate and rankconceptionsof international law, I con- clude in part V with some critical reflections on what D’Amato’s concept means for those twenty-first-century international lawyers who feel that international law needs to be saved. I. THE ARGUMENT: D’AMATO’S SELF-PRESERVING INTERNATIONAL LAW According to D’Amato, international law constitutes a self-preserving, self-sustaining, and self-salvaging system.More specifically, he contends that international law is engaged in aDar- winian struggle to survive. In this struggle, coherence, equality, and the pursuit of peaceful dis- pute resolution ensure that the international legal system is able topreserve itself. Because inter- national law is a self-preserving living system, it exists independently of state consent and operates to safeguard its own survival.6 Inmaking such a claim, D’Amato builds on his earlier work exploring the autopoietic char- acter of the international legal system.7 Autopoiesis teaches that international law’s territorial and state-based configuration does not sufficiently account for how it works.8 Legal systems interact on a functional basis beyond territorial units and nation states and achieve stability through the generation of their own parameters of validation (self-referentiality).9 This auto- poietic understanding of legal systems leaves little room for human agency.10 While such features of autopoietic systems theory were already present inD’Amato’s earlier work, he now refines his understanding of international law by borrowing frombiological the- ories of the self-reproducing nature of living systems.His emphasis is on those aspects of living bodies that permit themtomaintain their essential formwhile perpetuating themselves accord- ing to their distinctive internal organization. D’Amato gives his autopoietic concept of inter- national law an anthropomorphic spin by envisaging it as a living body intent on survival and capable of self-perpetuation. While anthropomorphic concepts are common in international legal scholarship,11 the anthropomorphic turn embraced by D’Amato comes to qualify the systemic nature of auto- poietic theory.12 In D’Amato’s anthropomorphic understanding, the system of international 6 Id. at 652.

U. L. REV. 136, 139 (1989). 10 In this respect, it has been claimed that autopoiesis “has dethroned the ‘subject’ in its claim to be unique in its self-referentiality.” Id. at 137. 11 E.g., Jean d’Aspremont, The International Law of Recognition: A Reply to Emmanuelle Tourme-Jouannet, 24 EUR.

D’Amato’s concept of self-preserving international law rests on a view in which interna- tional relations constitutes the environment of international law, so that the two are related but formally autonomous from one another. This view is consistent with the standard autopoietic premise that the system is highly dependent on its environment but autonomous at the level of its own operation.13 While these aspects of D’Amato’s concepts of self-preserving international law are clearly and explicitly articulated in his famous enchanting style, some other aspects of his concept of international law are either undefined or ambiguous. For instance, D’Amato does not address the immense challenge of incommensurability underlyinghis enterprise:Why andhowexactly can we extrapolate from the experiences of living things to those of a legal system? D’Amato’s readers are also entitled to some explanation of whether his concept of a self-pre- serving system is intended to be a descriptive or a normative account of law. It is unclear whether D’Amato is only trying to describe matters as they are or constructing a normative theory that seeks to revolutionize the way that we think about international law with a view to simultaneously “help[ing] litigators and negotiators make their international-law arguments sounder and more persuasive.”14 This ambiguity is exacerbated by D’Amato’s recourse to axi- omatic reasoning, an approach that appears slightly suspicious of false objectivism.This equiv- ocality is further aggravated by constant oscillations betweendeductive and inductivemoves.15 Such methodological hybridity, however common that it may be in international legal schol- arship, obfuscates the nature of D’Amato’s concept of self-preserving international law. II. THE CONTEXT: SELF-PRESERVING INTERNATIONAL LAW IN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP D’Amato’s concept of self-preserving international law constitutes a serious rupture with mainstreamapproaches to international lawcurrently found in theUnitedStates.This concept is where the originality of his construction lies. Although dominant in Europe, systemic con- ceptions of international law are often contested in the American tradition of international 13 Luhmann, supra note 9, at 148. 14 D’Amato, supra note 5, at 650. 15 All four of D’Amato’s axioms are presented as describing basic requirements of the international legal system as well as components of the theories of the self-preserving international legal system, while the propositions are meant to illustrate the sorting process that the system imposes on all potential legal rules that strive to become part of the system. This intricate construction is both deductive and inductive as both the axioms and the propositions seem postulated and inferred from another postulate. Such oscillations between deductive and inductive moves are certainly not unprecedented in the categories and constructs of international legal scholarship. International law is replete with doctrines that blend deduction and induction. A good example of this phenomenon is the account of how customary international law arises.

D’Amato’s most significant estrangement from the mainstream American legal scholarship lies elsewhere, however. Clearly, much has changed since the time when the American Journal of International Lawwas founded to produce orderly knowledge of international law based on analysis of cases and specific texts.21 Anyone seeking to navigate American international legal scholarshipmust nowbemethodologicallymultilingual.22 Eachof the different streams of that scholarship is constituted by and constitutive of methodological choices that may be difficult to decipher. Some are regulatory in nature, while others are meant to be more predictive or explanatory. After the turn to instrumentalism by the New Haven School in the 1950s and 1960s—ofwhichD’Amato has always been very critical23—there was a subsequent turn to liberal individualism through global institutionalism advocated by the Manhattan School in the 1970s and 1980s.24 These later developments had in common a move away from formalism25 and 16 Eyal Benvenisti, Comments on the Systemic Vision of National Courts as Part of an International Rule of Law, JERUSALEM REV.

The turn to legitimacy and compliance in the 1990s was followed, albeit not overwritten, by a turn to empiricism in the 2000s. The turn to legitimacy, spearheaded by Thomas Franck,27 has generated deep structural consequences in Anglo-American scholarship and practice. Its impact was so great because an interest in legitimacy allowed empirical inquiries (e.g., why do states comply with international law?) to conveniently converge with definitional inquiries (e.g., what is international law?).28 The search for legitimacy, by virtue of a rash presumption that international law can be witnessed and analyzed from an Archimedean vantage point, has simultaneously brought about a move away from a conceptual investigation of international law’s self-validating nature.29 The quest for legitimacy, authority, and effectiveness (and, relat- edly, the study of the dynamics that buttress each of these concepts) has ever since ranked high on the agenda of U.S. international lawyers, and especially its legal academics. As is well- known,more recently, this legitimacy school has gradually cededpride of place to the empirical school of international law that, evenwithout a detour through legitimacy, prioritizes the study of the conditions under which international law is formed and produces effects.30 The abovementioned turns to legitimacy and empiricism certainly differ in various respects, not least because of the discrepancies between the predictive methods of the former and the explanatory methods of the latter.31 At the same time, they share a common openness to mul- tidisciplinarymethods.32This connection iswhereD’Amato’s concept of self-preserving inter- national lawmakes its singular contribution. First, his concept of self-preserving international law relegates the pursuit of compliance and, to a lesser extent, those of authority and legitimacy (which become determined within the system and by the system) to second place.33 His self- preserving international law ensures that rules are patterned after state behavior or, at least, let themselves be informed by state behavior.34 As a result, measuring compliance will generate very limited insights, apart from allowing us to measure the transformation of international law. Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, D’Amato departs from the interdisciplinary mind-set that dominates contemporary American legal scholarship, for autopoietic theory allows one to look at the system exclusively from the inside (that is according to an internal perspective) without the need to resort to the tools or frameworks of other social sciences.

THENUANCE: SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PROCESSES OF A SELF-PRESERVING SYSTEM D’Amato ignores whatmight be called the “self-destructive” contradictionswithin his “self- preserving” system. He argues that self-preserving systems survive because of their capacity to generate crisis, contradictions, and destructions,36 which, in turn, bring about self-regenera- tion.37 Yet he seems to overlook the constitutive role that self-destructionmay play in self-pres- ervation.38 Consider, for instance, the implications of a more traditional rule-based approach to inter- national law infused with Kelsenian positivism—an approach that is not necessarily incom- patible with autopoiesis theory. From a rule-based Kelsenian perspective,39 every act of law application becomes an act of lawmaking; in the case of international law, law application gen- erates a single command by virtue of the auctoritatis interpositio (intervening authority) “that determines what the rule should mean in a particular case and whether, all things considered, applying the rule might be better than resorting to the exception.”40 In this conception, once this individual command is created and applied to the facts and actors involved, it exhausts itself and disappears simultaneously. Although the original norm from which it is derived remains untouched and unchanged by its application, applying the law generates a rule for the case at hand that is automatically destroyed in the course of its application. Such a rule-based Kelsenian approach to international law would provide nuance to D’Amato’s self-preserving international law by buttressing the idea that the operation of international law is necessarily accompanied by a process of self-destruction of commands.41 If, instead, law is understood as a form of discourse or argumentative practice42 geared towards persuading target audiences,43 a self-destructive dimension is inherent: legal argu- ments or opinions given in a particular case, once they are formulated and presented, exhaust 35 Klabbers, supra note 26; Martti Koskenniemi, Constitutionalism as Mindset: Reflections on Kantian Themes About International Law and Globalization, 8 THEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 9, 14 (2007); see alsoMartti Kosken- niemi,TheMystery of Legal Obligation, 3 INT’L THEORY 319 (2011). This aspect of D’Amato’s construction could be construed as resisting postmodernist scholarship. On the idea that autopoiesis constitutes a response to post- modernism, see ROGER COTTERRELL, THE POLITICS OF JURISPRUDENCE: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION TO LEGAL PHILOSOPHY 249 (2d ed. 2009). 36 Luhmann, supra note 9, at 148. 37 This dimension has been thoroughly explored in Marxist economic theory whereby overaccumulation leads to crisis, which is amoment of destruction, allowing the system to find alternative avenues for the overaccumulated capital. 38 Garcı ́a-Salmones Rovira, supra note 20, at 698. 39 On the relevance of Kelsenian positivism today, see Jörg Kammerhofer,Hans Kelsen in Today’s International Legal Scholarship, in INTERNATIONAL LEGAL POSITIVISM IN A POST-MODERN WORLD, supra note 18, at 81. 40 Koskenniemi, Constitutionalism as Mindset, supra note 35, at 10; Sahib Singh, The Potential of International Law: Fragmentation and Ethics, 24 LEIDEN J.

THE CHALLENGE: A SELF-PRESERVINGCOMMUNITY OF INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS? Is D’Amato’s concept of self-preserving international law valid in the first place? This ques- tion has, of course, no clear answer. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that there cannot be a meta-standpoint from which concepts or theories of law can be (in)validated and ranked except in terms of the context and social acceptance of the recipients.46 Designing any concept of international law, even a purely descriptive one,47 always presupposes subjective and nor- mative considerations that we expect commentators to divulge or acknowledge.48 It is now widely accepted that theories of international lawdonot result fromunprejudicedobservations made under a veil of ignorance49 and that almost any theory can be repudiated merely by changing descriptive, analytical, or conceptual frameworks. For these reasons, my intention here is not to argue for a better idea of international law than D’Amato’s offering. Instead, I merely suggest that a different image of international law can be defended on equally convinc- ing grounds. Consider just three alternative frameworks. First, one could abandon the idea that international law constitutes a system—or adjust the nature of the system so radically—to cast aside any occurrence of self-preservation. This step does not seem to be a difficult move tomake.50 Although there are obvious advantages to con- struing international law as a system,51 systemic thinking about international law is no longer reified in present international legal scholarship, especiallywithinAmerican international legal 44 I prefer the notion of intellectual universe rather than that of normative universe developed by Robert M. Cover, The Supreme Court 1982 Term—Foreword:Nomos and Narrative, 97 HARV. L. REV. 4, 4–5 (1983) (“We inhabit a nomos—a normative universe. We constantly create and maintain a world of right and wrong, of lawful and unlawful, of valid and void. . . . Once understood in the context of the narratives that give it meaning, law becomes not merely a system of rules to be observed, but a world in which we live.”). For a similar use of the idea of “intellectual universe,” see MARIO PROST, THE CONCEPT OF UNITY IN PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW 134 (2012). 45 PIERRE BOURDIEU, THE FIELD OF CULTURAL PRODUCTION 115–16, 158 (1993). 46 Martti Koskenniemi, Letter to the Editors of the Symposium, 93 AJIL 351, 352, 356 (1999); see also Kosken- niemi, supra note 43. 47 Mark Greenberg, How Facts Make Law, 10 LEGAL THEORY 157, 160 (2004). 48 Benedict Kingsbury &amp; Megan Donaldson, From Bilateralism to Publicness in International Law, in FROM BILATERALISMTOCOMMUNITY INTEREST: ESSAYS INHONOUROF JUDGEBRUNOSIMMA79, 86 (Ulrich Fas- tenrath et al. eds., 2011). 49 No preconceptual or even pretheoretical data exist outside any conceptual and descriptive framework.

Can an auto- poietic system ever be self-preserving? The internal coherence—that D’Amato uses inter- changeably with consistency—of the international legal system may be in contradiction with the main paradigms of systems theories according to which legal systems create the conflicts that they need for their own evolution and sophistication.55 Third, D’Amato’s axiomatic construction could be contradicted from an epistemological perspective by arguing that it is the community (or communities) of international lawyers, rather than international law, that is riven by self-preserving dynamics. On this view, which is not without constructivist overtones,56 international law is a battlegroundwhere profession- als of international law advocate for a certain vision of the law and, correspondingly, a certain way to make sense of the world. Against the backdrop of this argumentative battleground, international lawyers, like craftsmen, naturally coalesce into groups based on expertise, skills, political projects, or certain visions of the law. In this context, international lawyers come to share an inclination to federate into groups designed alongprofessional activities, paradigmatic and methodological lines, political aspirations, or, more simply, attitudes and mind-sets.57 To capture these federating processes, one could speak of guilds,58 community of practice,59 or epistemic community.60 The terminology does not really matter here. More important is the fact that the binding agent amongmembers of these various guilds of international lawpro- fessionals is not necessarily faith or belief in a given paradigm or methodology, shared doubts or contestation, but a calling for self-preservation. As Re ́gisDebray has demonstrated, all com- munities of professionals deploy strategies of self-preservation.61 International lawyers are no different. The need to preserve both the profession and their role drives international lawyers 52 Since David Hume, it has been accepted that the inductive constructions upon which systems are articulated are highly contested from a methodological point of view.

This consideration possibly points to the greatest weakness of D’Amato’s axiomatic construction: like autopoietic system theories in general,63 his self-preserving system constitutes an overly radical break from the agents that operate the system.64 Yet, if there is anything self-preserving in international law, it seems to lie with the attitudes of the commu- nity (and communities) organized around it. V. THE LESSONS: LET INTERNATIONAL LAW SAVE ITSELF In the context of American international legal scholarship, D’Amato stands as an inspiring knight confronting the dominant pragmatism of the legitimacy and empirical schools of inter- national law and their interdisciplinary and antisystemic moves. Approaching international law from the perspective of his concept of self-preserving international law is thus novel and will undoubtedly be conducive to gaining new insights in international legal thinking. Whether D’Amato’s theory will accede to the pantheon of the classical American schools of international law is not a question that can possibly be answered here, even if the discussion here is a step in that direction. Ultimately, the success of a theory hinges on its persuasiveness and social validation. In the case of D’Amato’s subtle constructions, none of them can be pre- judged at this stage. It seemsmore relevant to return to the introductory question raised above: Does international law need to be saved? As the foregoing has shown, the implications of D’Amato’s concept of self-preserving inter- national law reveal the futility of international lawyers’ attempts to save international law. If D’Amato is right and international law is indeed a self-preserving system, it takes care of itself, and international lawyers should accordingly devote their energy to less heroic tasks. If D’Amato is wrong and international law is not a self-preserving system, however, should inter- national lawyers renew the project of rescuing international law? David Bederman raised doubts about the project of “saving” international law more than a decade ago,65 but the topic has not attracted much discussion since that time. Instead, inter- national lawyers, for themost part, continue to believe in the necessity of shielding or rescuing international law from a variety of perceived imminent perils. More orthodox legal academics are usually concerned with what they see as the lethal rise of radical skepticism, indeterminacy, fragmentation, or simply what they call the “political.” More critical academics are wary of the resilience of deceitful objectivism in international legal studies or seek to resist techniques that create the illusion of a stable meaning or that obfuscate 62 AkbarRasulov,NewApproaches to International Law: Images of aGenealogy, inNEWAPPROACHESTO INTER- NATIONALLAW151 ( Jose ́1Marı ́a Beneyto&amp;DavidKennedy eds., 2012) (applyingDebray’s insights to the critical legal studies movement). 63 Luhmann, supra note 9, at 137. 64 See Garcı ́a-Salmones Rovira, supra note 20, at 693. 65 David J.

Legal advisers or activists, for their part, see great hazards in international law’s inability to maintain order or to contain violence, whether the challenge is Crimea and Ukraine, Syria and Iraq, Gaza and Israel, the Central African Republic and Cam- eroon, or somewhere else. As for judges, they see hazards for international law in the contem- porary dejudicialization of international relations or in the opposite phenomenon of its over- judicialization. International lawyers, while united in seeking its rescue, thus diverge as towhat allegedly threatens international law. Those disparate perceptions are the predictable result of the great variety of projects pursued by the professional lawyers involved. Those multiple perceptions can also be traced back to international lawyers’ inclination to see international law as an explanatory project geared towards a decomplexification of the world.66 It is argued here, however, that some of themore heroic international lawyers may not fully see that their own efforts to develop international law in evermore sophisticated categories exacerbate the complexity of the world and engender many of those perils from which they want to save international law.67 The self-preserving communities of professionals discussed above are thus a source of the perceived hazards threat- ening international law as well as the bearers of the shared feeling of the necessity to save inter- national law. Evenmore than his subtle and audacious theoretical construction, it is in posing a stark challenge to international lawyers’ quest to save international law thatD’Amato’s article might most durably change international legal thinking. WHO IS THE SYSTEM? ONCOMMITMENT, BIOLOGY, ANDHUMAN BEINGS IN THE POLITICS OF “GROUNDWORK FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW” ByMo ́nica Garcı ́a-Salmones Rovira* Professor Anthony D’Amato’s “Groundwork for International Law” (Groundwork) is an extremely pedagogical project. Despite its apparent simplicity, each rereading reveals a new layer of complexity, reflecting the depth of his lifelong engagement in the scholarship of inter- national law. Moreover, from a certain perspective, his reexamination of the foundations of international law expresses a radicalism that reaches beyond the analysis of legal forms to pro- voke reflection on the nature and purpose of the international legal system.1 66 See generally Anne Peters, Realizing Utopia as a Scholarly Endeavor, 24 EUR.
