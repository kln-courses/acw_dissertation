<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA: AN INTERIM REPORT ON THE BRITISH PROJECT AT VETREN1 (PLATES 21-30) Mieczystaw Marian Domaradzki, in memoriam INTRODUCTION UNTIL the discovery of an urban type of site at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa near Vetren, central Bulgaria, in 1988, scholars had assumed that cities were a post-Macedonian phenomenon in inland Thrace, a Mediterranean form of socio-economic organization grafted onto a native, ' Archaeological investigations at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa, Vetren, have been conducted under the auspices of an international agreement between the Institute of Archaeology and Museums of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and the School of Archaeology, Classics and Oriental Studies, University of Liverpool (1996-2000, extended in 2001 for a further five-year period). The agreement is bilateral, but a similar agreement has been drawn up with Charles University, Prague, and the implications of joint activity are envisaged in the text of both agreements. The joint international team publishes a monograph series, Pistiros, Excavations and Studies (Charles University, Prague). The work described in this paper was generously funded by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Board (1999-2000). We should like to thank, at the Liverpool end, ProfessorsJohn Kenyon Davies and Elizabeth Slater, current and former Heads of School, for their active support, advice and patience; and at the Bulgarian end, Professor Dr. Yordanka Yourukova, Director of the Institute of Archaeology and acting Director of the field project at Vetren (following the tragic death of M. Domaradzki in June 1998); Valentina Taneva, Director of the Archaeological Museum, Septemvri, Lydia Domaradzka (epigrapher), Emiliya Petrova Ivanova (Museum Conservationist and Designer), other members of staff in Septemvri Museum, the 20 pensioners from Septemvri and Vetren who represent the resident field team, and successive mayors of the municipality and other officials who cannot all be named individually, who have provided assistance, accommodation and transport, and helped to make our visits comfortable and enjoyable. Our thanks are also extended to our Bulgarian (Gavrail Lazov and Daniela Katin'arova) and Czech colleagues (ProfessorJan Bouzek,Jifi Musil, Lada Bohai) in the Pistiros team, whose warm collaboration is much appreciated. Finally, special thanks are due to all those academic colleagues who have supported this project in one way or another throughout its course, especially to Professor SirJohn Boardman. Fieldwork was conducted over a total period of four and a half months in July and August i999, May and July 2000, with a supplementary field trip in May 2oo.001 Dr Z. Archibald was responsible for the overall co-ordination of the project. Dr Archibald and Dr Mark Adams (National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside = NMGM) acted as field supervisors for the two excavated sectors; Dr. Adams was responsible for the collection and processing of electronic field data (EDM survey and contour survey) and acts as advisor for the identification and conservation of metallurgical remains. The field team included Clare Ahmad (responsible for finds processing and storage, and for the finds database), Rebecca Bridgeman, Liz Callander (NMGM), Cosima Doerfel, Dave Hammond, Rose Hazleton, Donna Henshaw, William Moore, Alan Moss (graduates and undergraduates of the University of Liverpool); James Goad; and Jeff Speakman (NMGM, advisor on data base management and strategy for finds). Sue Stallibrass (University of Liverpool and English Heritage) was responsible for the assessment of faunal data. The geophysics team (GSB Prospection, Bradford) was led by Sue Ovenden, assisted by Fiona Robertson and Louis Harvey.

Various coastal communities along the Aegean and Black Sea shores of Thrace are documented in a wide body of ancient sources.2 These have commonly been regarded as distinct from settlements in the interior, in terms both of 'ethnic' origin and formal (institutional and cultural) structures. The site at Vetren therefore presents a considerable challenge to the traditional picture, lying several hundred kilometres from the nearest, Aegean, coast, and separated from it by the Rhodope mountains (FIG. I; PLATE 21 a). One of the aims of the current investigative programme is to try and determine whether this site is in some way exceptional, or whether inland settlement patterns have hitherto been misconceived. A further complication is presented by an inscription (SEG 43. 486; 46. 872*; 47. 1101), dated c. 350 BC, carved in Greek letters, and found approximately 2 km north-east of the excavated site, reused at a Roman mansio. The text refers to qMtopaTcL (and therefore, it is assumed, an emporion) at Pistiros, evidently subject to the authority of a local Thracian ruler. The very different interpretations of this text drawn up by the contributors to a recent dossier in BCH 123 (1999), 247-71, reflect the variety of assumptions which scholars have made about the nature of settlements in this inland region.3 The implications of the inscribed text go beyond issues of urbanization, since they have a political dimension too. The people of Pistiros were granted a considerable degree of autonomy. If Pistiros were to be equated with Pistyros, the Thasian settlement on the north Aegean coast referred to briefly by Herodotus (Hdt. vii. 109), then the power of Odrysian rulers to intervene in the affairs of settlements in the peraia was much more far reaching than has been considered likely.4 It seems implausible that Odrysian princes should exercise statutory authority over a community previously considered a dependent territory of Thasos, particularly when Thasians are among the named beneficiaries of the guarantees bestowed by the decree. Conflation of the Thasian Pistyros with the site referred to in the inscription presents other difficulties. The limited archaeological investigations at Pontolivadon, the likeliest location of Herodotus' town, do not suggest a major international centre of exchange, which is what the text implies.5 Moreover, the prominence of Maronitans (who seem to be given preferential treatment above visitors from Thasos and Apollonia) makes the connection historically even harder to sustain. If we are dealing with two sites sharing a similar name (which is etymologically of local, that is, east Balkan origin),6 then Pistiros in Thrace Pistiros I = J. Bouzek, M. Domaradzki, and Z. H. Archibald (eds), Pistiros I: Excavations and Studies (Charles University, Prague, 1996). Pistiros 2 = J. Bouzek, L. Domaradzka, and Z. H. Archibald (eds), Pistiros 2: Excavations and Studies (Charles University, Prague, 2002). 2 B. Isaac, The Greek Settlements in Thrace until the Roman Conquest (Leiden, 1986). 3 Fr. Salviat argues that the findspot of the inscription requires us to locate the Pistyros referred to by Herodotos (vii. o109) in central Thrace, rather than along the north Aegean coastal strip (BCH 123. 270), and even attributes membership of the Delian League to the same community by identifying it with the 'Kystirioi' of the Tribute Lists. B. Bravo and A. Chankowski, on the other hand, affirm that the epigraphically attested Pistiros is a polis, but deny that it has anything to do with the archaeological remains at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa (ibid., 275-317). The other contributors to the volume, V Chankowski and L. Domaradzka (247-58), K. Bolnakov (319-29), O. Picard (331-46), L. Domaradzka (347-58), and L. Loukopoulou (359-71), accept the identification of the latter with the epigraphic Pistiros. Salviat was not aware of some more recent investigations of Persian movements in Thrace when he compiled his article (see further Odrysian Kingdom, 79-90). 4 Notwithstanding the comments made by Demosthenes concerning the propensity of Kotys I to 'seize' Greek cities (23.

ARCHIBALD might be located anywhere in the east Balkans, including Adzhiyska Vodenitsa. There are strong arguments in favour of the identification of Pistiros with the latter.7 The study of settlement patterns in the east Balkans, which correspond roughly with ancient Thrace, has lagged behind similar studies in neighbouring parts of the Aegean. The east Balkan landmass is divided politically between three modern states, Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. Research priorities for the period of antiquity in 'Thrace' (corresponding with the administrative districts of Xanthi, Rhodope and Evros in north Aegean Greece, Turkey-in- Europe, and the whole of Bulgaria), have, in all three countries, and notwithstanding certain exceptions, focussed on projects in a restricted number of coastal settlements, particularly those that are better known from ancient Greek textual sources. There has been little incentive, and few opportunities, to initiate systematic field exploration of a more wide- ranging type. This explains why the site near Vetren is hard to put into context, be it historical or archaeological. The range of articles published in the dossier already referred to take, as their starting point, the narrative history of the sixth and fifth centuries BC in the north Aegean. In this study we present a selective analysis of the archaeological data from the site of Adzhiyska Vodenitsa itself, based on work carried out by the British team in 1995 and 1999-2001. Our aims are to explain the programme of research, describe what our current investigations have revealed, and to outline the issues such evidence presents us with. We are convinced that this programme will contribute significantly to the current debate about sites designated poleis and emporia.8 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROJECT Before the discoveries near Vetren, very little was known about Late Iron Age settlements in Bulgaria.9 Excepting Seuthopolis, in the Valley of the Roses;I' the 'Krakra' hillfort at Pernik, 7 I have set out the archaeological arguments in support of the identification in a forthcoming paper: 'The Odrysian river port near Vetren, Bulgaria, and the Pistiros inscription', Talanta, 32/3 (2001), 253-75. 8 These issues have been the subject of debate in successive conferences and volumes published by the Copenhagen Polis Centre; I select here those papers which are of particular relevance for the analysis of Adzhiyska Vodenitsa: M. H. Hansen, 'Introduction: the polis as a citizen-state', in The Ancient Greek City State (Symposium on the Occasion of the 25oth Anniversary of the Royal Danish academy of Sciences and Letters, July 1-4 1992): Papers from the Copenhagen Polis Centre, I (Royal Danish Academy of Letters and Sciences, Historisk-filosofiske Meddelelser, 67; Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1993), 7-29; M.

Rouillard (eds), L'Emporion (Paris, 1993), 163-226. 9 The Late Iron Age corresponds broadly with the second half of the first millennium BC in Thrace. The academic discourse on archaeological chronologies of the first millennium BC is surveyed in Odrysian Kingdom, 26-47. Since the inception of fieldwork at Vetren, Late Iron Age activity has been registered at a large number of sites following the systematization and computerization of a Bulgarian monuments record (AKB = Arkheologicheska Karta na Bfilgariya, 1992-4). Further investigations have been seriously hampered by funding constraints and delays in publication. A small number of relevant monographs deserve mention: A.

ARCHIBALD in the upper Strymon valley," and Malkoto kale, Ravadino, near Apollonia Pontike (modern Sozopol) on the Black Sea,2 no inland site from the second half of the first millennium BC had been systematically investigated (although Late Iron Age material had been documented at a large number of locations). All the above-named sites provided evidence of architectural plans with some pretensions, dating to the period after Thrace had been captured by Philip II of Macedon in a prolonged series of campaigns between 342 and 340 BC.'3 Most of what was known in the I98os about the region's earlier history was derived from funerary evidence, particularly tumulus burials. The Central or 'Thracian' Plain of Bulgaria, and the adjacent valleys south of the Balkan range, are particularly rich in funerary material datable to the fifth to third centuries BC,'4 and some inferences could be drawn on this basis about thriving local communities. But until actual settlements were investigated, little progress could be made towards characterizing the societies that raised these monuments. About Ioo km west of Plovdiv, north of the municipality of Septemvri, and c. I km north of the current bed of the River Maritsa (ancient Hebros), on the first terrace above the flood plain, and close to a modern pumping station (successor to Hadji's watermill, Adzhiyska Vodenitsa), are substantial traces of habitation, including masonry and brick structures with tiled roofs, stone lined drains, and a masonry fortification wall (FIG. 2; PLATES 21 b, 22 a, 24 a). The terrace consists of a bank, 12-14 m in height, extending from north-west to south-east, composed of Quaternary sediments laid down by the River Maritsa as it cut a channel through the gneiss and marble deposits of the Momina Klisura gorge near Belovo.'5 Finds from the first two seasons included silver coins from Thasos and their imitations, coins of Odrysian fifth- and fourth-century BC rulers,16 imported Attic figured and plain black glazed vessels dating from the final third of the fifth to the mid-fourth century BC, as well as a wide range of locally produced ceramic fabrics. Ivan Venedikov had published a brief notice of a masonry tomb inside a nearby tumulus, which is situated some 500 m north of the excavated remains, while a second, partially excavated, unpublished, tumulus is situated closer to the site, c. 200 m north.'7 Mieczyslaw Domaradzki, Senior Field Officer at the Institute of Archaeology, Sofia, who had previously excavated at Kabyle, and whose principal research interest was the Celtic presence in "J.

The distribution of Hellenistic coin hoards appeared to relate to settlement configurations, but further investigation was required in order to find out whether hoard burial was in any way related to intrusive Celtic movements, or to other socio-economic phenomena. A substantial number of early Hellenistic hoards has been documented in Thrace, particularly in the Central Plain. These were preceded by concentrations exhibiting a different, but equally distinctive, spatial organization.'9 The earliest hoards seem to concentrate in particular areas of the Central Plain. One of these concentrations focused on Vetren and its environs. A preliminary resistivity survey on the terrace, carried out by Ilian Katevski in 1988, produced a number of very strong anomalies. One of these corresponded to a substantial fortification wall, running from north-west to south-east. Between 1988 and 1992, Domaradzki developed a programme of systematic excavation on the terrace, in the vicinity of the fortification wall, combined with field survey in the fields around the terrace. There was no available infrastructure, in this largely rural municipality, to support the investigation of what was to become an internationally significant site. A plan had to be conceived and developed, on very limited funding, to find suitable storage accommodation, create facilities for conservation, and train local pensioner volunteers-to wield not just the mattock, but the trowel and brush. Unlike colleagues working with prehistoric or Roman material, he could expect only a handful of specialists to provide assistance with finds. Much of what was being discovered was previously unknown or had few local analogies. This could partly be accounted for by the paucity of excavated settlement evidence. But many discoveries clearly pointed to long distance connections too-the masonry style of the fortification wall;20 the notable quantities of imported ceramics, particularly transport amphorae and fine tableware; the exceptionally large numbers of coins, some issued by local Thracian dynasts, but many emanating from Aegean coastal centres. The high proportion of copper alloy coins, including some of the earliest such emissions in the Aegean, seemed to confirm that this was a site with a significant commercial dimension, a characteristic enhanced by the presence of purpose- built storage facilities and a wide range of on-site metallurgical activities.2' Adzhiyska Vodenitsa seemed an ideal candidate for international collaboration. An initial agreement between the Institute of Archaeology in Sofia and the University of Bradford (1992-5), with Tim Taylor and myself as leaders of the British team, was warmly supported by Professor Velizar Velkov, the then Director of the Institute and of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. The Bulgarian team was expanded to include Gavrail Lazov (Curator of Antiquities, National Historical Museum, Sofia), and Daniela Katiniarova (National Regional Museum, Pazardzhik). In 1993 we were joined by ProfessorJan Bouzek and graduate students of Charles University, Prague. The period 1992-5 was a transitional phase in the site's excavation history-from a small scale project, run by one archaeologist, at his own pace and within the parameters set by local institutions; to a complex team venture, which had no close precedent and wide ambitions.

ARCHIBALD From the start, the international team's aim was to develop a joint field strategy and a common recording system to set up unified procedures for the processing and selection of finds, and to collaborate in the preparation of joint reports and monographs. The development of an appropriate local infrastructure for excavation and research was a time consuming process. Following various temporary solutions to the problem of finds storage, the archive and documentation system in Septemvri Museum was put in place during 1995. Joint organization was laborious and communication difficult before the arrival of the Internet and email at the Museum (sadly, in this case, after Domaradzki's death). Notwithstanding the warm support of many members of the Institute of Archaeology in Sofia, and above all Professor Velizar Velkov, and latterly, Professor Yordanka Yourukova, resources on all sides were extremely slim. The national and international members of the team contributed to the year-by-year maintenance of the project and provided technical equipment and other resources. The incorporation of the local collections as the Archaeological Museum of Septemvri, the provision of conservation equipment and materials, a personal computer, software, a flotation tank for organic residues, excavation tools, and essential library and training resources, are all the result of close and effective collaboration among the team members." The first fruits of our collaboration were published in 1996, in the primary volume of the monograph series, Pistiros: Excavations and Studies. To an international audience, it is hard to convey the significance of its success. The contributors all spoke different languages; the manuscripts were, for the most part, typed on ancient Cyrillic machines and manually corrected. Translations were written, rewritten and improved on by different individuals in different countries. Communication was by mail and took weeks. The book was the making of the Pistiros team. Individual contributions give hints of the difficulties we faced in grappling with such heavily fragmented variety. This first volume reflects the massive contribution made by Domaradzki to the shape and direction of the whole project, and the specialist studies are entirely based on his own excavations. The second volume (Pistiros 2) consolidates these achievements, with reports on the earliest work of the British, Czech, and Franco-Bulgarian teams. It was clear, from the earliest excavation seasons, that the site at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa had direct connections with the Odrysian rulers who governed Thrace before Philip II's conquest (and subsequently). This was apparent in the circulation of princely coin issues, some of the finest commissioned for the Odrysian dynasty, and in the high quality of masonry techniques, which are best matched in the built funerary monuments of the native dlite.23 The discovery of a princely decree, carved onto a giant granite block, found at Asar dere, just 2 km north-east, in December 1990, has been interpreted by Velkov and Domaradzka,24 and by the Director himself,25 as emanating originally from Adzhiyska Vodenitsa. There is no evidence that the stone, reused in a Roman road station, came from an older structure in the immediate vicinity of the mansio. Since other fourth-century BC inscriptions, albeit private ones, have been 22 The single largest donation, for the purchase of a site vehicle, we owe to the generosity of Mr Richard Vaughan- Davies, of Mold and Chester, whose name and connections are emblazoned, together with the project's logo, on the sides of a now much used dark blue Moskvich. 23J.

Whether it is or not, there are strong grounds for considering this site to have been an emporion, a designated and regulated place of international exchange under Odrysian patronage.27 A joint Franco-Bulgarian survey of a 2o km area around the site aims to clarify the nature of ancient settlement patterns in the vicinity of Adzhiyska Vodenitsa, and to discover a hierarchy, if such should exist, as well as possible procurement zones for raw materials.28 JOINT EXCAVATION METHODS The excavations at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa have been conducted according to guidelines laid down by the Institute of Archaeology, Sofia. The terrace was originally divided into grid squares labelled with a letter and a number in relation to a fixed trigonometric point on the southern side of the terrace. Trenches are dug in plana or spits, in open plan within the grid squares, and finds (coins, complete ceramic vessels, metal objects, graffiti, ornaments, tools) are registered in site-wide finds notebooks, and located by co-ordinates within each io m grid square. All ceramic material and bones are collected in batches, which are given a ceramic ('K') number, sorted by type after washing (eg. bone, tile, chimney pot, fired clay, baked brick, storage jar or pithos, transport amphora, portable brazier, crucible, coarse cooking pot, fine ware local and imported), and gross numbers of bone and sherds (further subdivided into rims, handles, bases, etc.) are recorded in the ceramic notebooks. Soil samples can be selected for flotation on site. (Pressurized water is provided by the nearby pumping station, which replaced the eponymous water mill.) In any given area, selection strategies for flotation, and the drawing of sections and plans, is the responsibility of individual archaeologists. In practice comparatively few plans are drawn, and there is a tendency to favour plans of stone structures and of unusual clay constructions, rather than to make routine plans of all features at a particular level within a quadrat or trench. The weakness of this system is that multiple or complex features, of organic rather than inorganic origin, may be hard to identify, notwithstanding photographic documentation. A great deal of contextual information is contained in the archive notebooks collected for each grid square and deposited in the archives of the Septemvri Archaeological Museum. In 1992, a new four-digit numerical grid was introduced in preparation for the geophysical survey within and beyond the terrace. The old system is still used in the excavated sectors of the terrace for convenience. All non-ceramic finds are registered and conveyed to the Archaeological Museum Septemvri for conservation and study. An on-site selection is made of ceramic finds, once gross numbers have been recorded. The large quantities of bulk finds accumulated at Vetren mean that only a small proportion is retained for the Museum. (A substantial archive of diagnostic 26 L.

Each project group (Bulgarian, Czech, British, French) has its own inventory books and archives, in addition to the site-wide folders. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE JOINT EXCAVATION AND FIELDWORK PROGRAMME Investigation of areas west and east of the fortification wall by Domaradzki in 1988-92 posed a number of questions for subsequent research. The principal issues addressed by the international team may be summarized as follows: In historical terms i. What kind of site has been discovered? 2. Who were the occupants? 3. How should we envisage mechanisms of exchange (cultural and technical, as well as commercial), as reflected in long-range imports? In archaeological terms 4. How large is the site? 5. What natural/cultural changes took place during its existence? 6. Can zones or functional areas be distinguished? Domaradzki's investigations revealed that the circuit wall was built to high specifications in terms of the standards of craftsmanship available in the eastern Mediterranean during the final third of the fifth century BC.29 He showed that the area within it was planned on a scale appropriate for a sizeable urban centre, with a street grid based on the main east-west road, and terminating at the eastern gateway. He demonstrated the range of finds, pointing to industrial, commercial, and religious activity, and outlined the three principal phases of the site's history: Period i: second half of the fifth to early fourth century BC: initial occupation, contemporary with the construction of the fortification wall. Period 2: 380s/370s-c. 300 BC, reorganization of the eastern gateway, and construction of an exterior tower; construction of various buildings within and outside the circuit (e.g. in the area defined as 'Pistiros III', identified by geophysics); residential activity at 'Pistiros II' (excavated by the Czech mission, 1994-7).30 Period 3: c. 300 BC, extensive destruction on many parts of the site, including the eastern gateway, followed by very different reconstruction of this exit, with a new cobbled, not paved road surface. The discovery of large numbers of coins on and in the vicinity of the east-west road has provided unusually precise dating for the transition from period 2 to period 3.3' No traces have 29 V.

Our first task was to classify such finds. Much earlier material found its way into these levels, either as residual debris, or as the contents of periodic dumping.34 During the first years of collaboration, it became increasingly clear that the site's taphonomy was particularly complex, and would require a more exacting method of documentation in order to distinguish different kinds of successive behaviour. Large quantities of industrial waste were dumped in and around the complex of rooms known as 'Building no. i' (see FIG. 2, quadrats Ao9, Aio, AI4, and PLATE 21 b), the first major structure west of the gateway, on the northern side of the main road, presumably after it went out of use. In view of the widespread evidence of metallurgical activity, in the form of moulds, crucibles and hearth bottoms, as well as finished products in a variety of styles and materials,35 further strategies were required for the identification and location of production sites. Between 1992 and 1995, collective endeavours concentrated on identifying the spatial character of the settlement. Domaradzki continued to investigate the quadrats south of the fortification wall, opened up in 1991-3 (FIG. 2, quadrats BI2, B17, B22, B'2), Gavrail Lazov took over the exploration of further rooms belonging to Building no. I, and began to investigate the area west of this building, where a series of clay altars was discovered.36 The Czech mission opened up a trench at the far western edge of the terrace in the hope of discovering the westward course of the fortification wall, while the British team opened two Io m trenches, on the northern and southern sectors of the terrace respectively (1994-5; FIG. 3), and completed the first stage of a geophysical programme to examine the nature of ancient activities beyond the confines of the terrace (1992-4; see Ovenden below). From 1996 onwards, the Bulgarian and Czech teams concentrated on the main east-west road and adjacent structures. Building no. I was found to have a portico facing the road, while a similar arrangement seemed to be emerging on the opposite side of the street, where the Czech mission discovered a shop or warehouse with storage vessels in situ. The same set of rooms concealed, in a wall niche, a pot hoard of 552 Macedonian coins, buried in the 280s BC.37 Detailed investigation of the street, and structures opening onto it, confirmed a network of 32 The succession of road pavings is being studied by D. Katincarova, to whom I am indebted for information from her unpublished work; her investigations in 2000 showed that the first road surface was narrower than its successors (or positioned slightly further south, albeit on the same overall alignment as the later pavings). The size and finishing of the slabs corresponds to those found in the first pavement of the eastern gateway. This was succeeded by at least two further paved surfaces, including the latest, cobbled surface. 33 J. Bouzek, 'Addenda to Pistiros I', in Pistiros 2; cf.

RESEARCH AIMS OF THE BRITISH PROJECT, 1999-2001 Fieldwork by the British team resumed in 1999 with three principal aims; to continue the programme of remote sensing, so as to clarify such archaeology as might have survived in the flood terrace, and in the ploughed fields to the north, west and east of the excavated sectors; to excavate the two trenches already designated, generating an electronic record; and to initiate a study of faunal remains. The surveys conducted in 1992-4, using gradiometry, complemented by magnetic susceptibility sampling, revealed a pattern of anomalies north and east of the terrace, implying a range of intra-and extra-mural activities. A third-century-BC kiln, used for making storage vessels and tableware in the local buff-coloured fabric, was subsequently identified at the north-eastern periphery of the terrace, in line with one such anomaly.39 The two British trenches selected for excavation were intended to complement the more intensively built up areas either side of the east-west street. The more northerly trench (quadrats DI9 and D24), coincided in part with the sector most severely damaged by agricultural machinery during the Ig80s (DI9), but was extended to include undamaged strata at the westernmost periphery of the terrace (D24). The damaged sector was known to contain a large number of pits, closely spaced, perhaps in a planned configuration. A preliminary study (in 1995) of surviving deposits at the northern margin of quadrat D24, adjacent to DI9 on its southern side, had shown that the pits continued in this direction, but cut into earlier levels. The aim here was first, to clarify the function of the pits, and of this sector as a whole; and second, to find the stratigraphic relationship of surviving deposits to the known sequences in other sectors. DI9 is separated from the ritual altars and the offerings associated with them (esp. quadrat A6, investigated by Lazov) by no more than 25 m. The southern trench, in quadrat B2I, is set back some 15 m from the east-west road. It was selected in order to find out whether built structures, of the kind found either side of the main road, extended southwards to form insulae, or some other pattern pertained. An area free of major structures would provide an opportunity to investigate a complete chronological sequence. The adjacent square eastwards (B22), excavated by Domaradzki, along with two quadrats south-east of it (B'2, B'7), and BI7, to the north east, contained storage pithoi, offering places in the form of ash deposits and clay altars (of the same kind as those investigated by Lazov), fired hearths, traces of metallurgical debris and wells, but no built architecture. It was unclear whether this zone represented an open avenue adjacent to the circuit wall, or whether a precinct, reserved specifically for cult, may have extended into B2I as well. Bearing in mind what was said earlier about the complex history and reuse of different areas already observed elsewhere on site, the northern and southern trenches were excavated stratigraphically, using a sequence of numbered contexts, and documented using a modified version of data sheets developed by the Department of Urban Archaeology, Museum of London. We hoped that the matrix or matrices to emerge from the context sequences in both 38 M. Domaradzki, 'Interim 2', 14-16. 39 The kiln, whose excavation was supervised by M. Domaradzki and V. Taneva, is referred to by Domaradzki, 'Interim 2', 13, but no details have yet been published.</page><page sequence="14">322 ZOFIA H. ARCHIBALD trenches would enable us to propose a more nuanced history of the site, particularly with regard to its earlier and later phases. All contexts were planned prior to excavation, and all cut features were planned after removal of the fills. Plans were drawn at a scale of I : 20 (or I : Io) and sections I : Io. Selected deposits were photographed prior to excavation. Negative features were half sectioned, and the sections drawn and photographed prior to removal of the remaining fill or fills. The fast evaporation rate in the summer months made it difficult to detect ephemeral features satisfactorily. In consequence, May was found to be the optimal time for excavating. All ceramic finds are classified following the site-wide system already referred to, and subsequently weighed according to fabric type. An electronic database of all finds, including discarded material, as well as objects selected for museum storage, contains numbers and weights for all data sets by context. This makes it easier to compare relative quantities of different object categories, and will be convertible, at a later stage, to minimum numbers of vessels, containers or roof areas.40 At Vetren the state of preservation of faunal material is good, and the quantities collected to date from all excavated trenches provide a statistically valid sample (approximately one tonne, Ioo kg, of bone is available for study, although the bulk of it was recovered by hand). In 2000, approximately one-third of the total material excavated over the previous ten years in all sectors was assessed with regard to the physical condition of the bones, their containers and their labels. In nearly all cases, the bones are well preserved and are still associated with detailed and clearly legible labels. Such integrity enabled us to assess the potential of this material to address archaeological questions, such as those listed above. The main limitations of the faunal remains derive from the stratigraphic control of the excavations: in places, material was excavated and recorded spatially and with regard to horizontal level rather than by individual context. Although this sometimes limits the possibilities of comparing material from specific contexts or context types, spatial information is always available, and the faunal remains are always firmly associated with other material (such as ceramics and metalwork) recovered from the same excavated sediment. In addition to the broad aims of the project, the faunal analysis seeks to investigate the nature of the food and subsistence base. To what extent were wild resources utilized? How and where were the domestic livestock husbanded? Was the settlement self- sufficient and did livestock and/or their products form part of a trading system? Within the settlement, did people have differential access to various types of animal resource? Are there cultural practices with regard to how animals were treated, either dead or alive, and were some of these traits associated with religious activities? How do the results of all of these analyses compare with those from other sites in the region, and do they demonstrate or suggest cultural differences or temporal changes? EXCAVATIONS IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR, TRENCH D19/D24 Following the excavation of one deep pit (DI9/o9) in 1993-4,4' quadrat Dig was reinvestigated in 1999-200oo1. A larger area had been cleaned in 1992, corresponding to a block of four Io m squares (DI4, 15, I9, and D2o). Some thirteen features, resembling more or less regular pit 40 The site documentation is being converted systematically to electronic form, so that it can be deposited with the Archaeology Data Service in York, and thus be widely accessible via the ADS website http: //ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/. 41 Archibald, 'Underground deposits'.</page><page sequence="15">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA 323 fills, had earlier been identified.42 These fills were clearly visible as patches of pale grey, flecked with charcoal, and interspersed with traces of brick, tile and pot, against the distinctive rust- red natural soil of the terrace. The upper layers of these pits were destroyed by machinery, and fragments of pot and tile from their fills were still scattered on the surface. Closer observation of surviving features indicated that there was a higher concentration of such pit-fills than previously identified, and that these were by no means uniform in character. Restricted access to the complete area previously cleared in 1992 made it practicable to re-explore only one of these, DI9. A total of twenty pits was identified in this square alone, leaving aside two large pits which straddle squares DI9 and D24 (FIG. 4). Of the twenty-two pit circles thus identified, fourteen have a similar surface appearance, although the colour and contents of the fills differ. They are circular or slightly sub-circular in form, with dimensions varying between I.o and 1.7 m in diameter, and are closely, but irregularly, distributed over the io m square (PLATE 23 a). It is likely that all the pits were originally dug into a habitation deposit, although this had been stripped mechanically in all but the final metre on the southern boundary, adjacent to D24 (PLATE 23 b; FIG. 4). Comparison with surviving deposits in D24 suggests that machine stripping was easier through the softer archaeological deposits, and ceased on reaching sterile soil, into which the lower halves of the pits were dug. The missing stratigraphy from DI9 can partly be reconstructed from surviving deposits on the northern boundary of D24, where similar pits were also found (PLATE 23 b). Most of quadrat D24 is largely uncontaminated, and will provide more detailed information in future years. The remaining seven pits are much smaller than those already described, and seem to represent a different process altogether. The fourteen larger units, when excavated, were found to constitute two separate categories. Lined pits Six of the larger pits contained a lining, c. 5-1o cm thick, made of sterile clay. The deepest of these (19/o9, maximum surviving depth 2.40 m, 1.15-1.24 m wide) was of cylindrical form, and contained a fill of thin, grey, friable, sandy loam, mixed with ash and charcoal, and occasional admixtures of gravel and schist. This is one of the most characteristic types of pit fill noted elsewhere on site.43 Most of the pit fills described here were of similar composition, although in some cases distinct lenses of greenish-yellow sand, gravel and charcoal could be distinguished. Frequently such lenses merged quickly, as in this case, with ashy sand and brownish loam to become virtually invisible in section. Pit 19/22 context [Ioo5], on the boundary of DI9 and D24, also cylindrical in shape (maximum width I.o7 m, maximum surviving depth 1.13 m) contained a very similar fill, but with visibly more sand and gravel (PLATE 23 b; FIG. 4). The adjacent pit 19/21 context [Ioo3], which 19/22 cuts on its south- eastern perimeter, contained the same type of grey soil [Iooo], but was heavily contaminated with a big layer of sand and gravel [1002], that seeped into it from the south-south-eastern side, and spread, almost filling the lower half of the pit. Its shape is more visibly vascular (maximum diameter 1.69 m, base diameter 1.62-1.63 m, maximum surviving depth 1.65 m). This pit must have been only partially filled when one of the periodic inundations of the River Maritsa enveloped the site. The surviving stratigraphic section just south of these features in D24 shows a number of gravel deposits in the latter part of the site's history (FIG. 5). Since the pit was cut into a layer overlying two major earlier 42 Domaradzki, 'Interim', 15. 43 Archibald, 'Underground deposits'; cf. the description of a pit in D7, excavated in 1990 (Domaradzki, 'Interim', 29). Only the grey soil, which constituted most of the latter's fill, contained finds. The brown soil at the base formed a distinct layer and contained no inorganic finds. On-site flotation of soil samples, and the examination of organic material derived from them, began in 1994, after excavation of pit i9/o9 was completed. Sampling of deposits from more recent fills may well cast light on such distinctions (see further discussion and n. 47).</page><page sequence="16">324 ZOFIA H.

A worked astragalus of a sheep or goat was also recovered from the pit (cf. PLATE 27 b). 46 e.g. G.

ARCHIBALD Two further pits, 19/o2 contexts [o1021, 1022] and 19/03 contexts [o123, 1o24] were somewhat shallower (surviving depth 0.94 m, &gt;o.6o m respectively), but presented clearer evidence of stratification of the fills. A dark, moist, ashy deposit full of charcoal lay at the base of each of the lined pits, and probably represents burnt organic matter.47 This was covered with silty sand, or sand and gravel, succeeded by a smaller charcoal and ash layer, then more sandy loam. Pit 19/o6 contexts [1029, 1030] (1.80-2.15 m in diameter, 1.30 m deep), contained a similar stratification of ash and charcoal succeeded by silty sand and gravel between layers of brown loam. All the six big pits contained large quantities of finds, for the most part heavily fragmented, including coarse and fine (local wheelmade grey and buff fabrics) wares, Aegean transport amphora, local pithos, and portable brazier sherds, bone, river stones and occasionally metal objects or other materials. I9/09 contained a heavily corroded iron sword, broken into three parts (PLATE 25 a), and a complete lamp with two nozzles, made in the local grey fabric (PLATE 30 b). 19/02 yielded an almost complete amphoroid vessel of unique form (PLATE 24 b), the rim and shoulders of a grey wheelmade amphora (PLATE 25 b), and a grey wheelmade decorated krater (PLATE 25 c). 19/21 produced a crucible base, broken in half (PLATE 28 b), and 19/22 a wall sherd belonging to an Attic Panathenaic amphora, inscribed Athenagoras, payment for a day' ('A6lvpay6prYg r.tp'Lpg LoFOO6v) (PLATE 26 a). Such unusual items are worth contemplating. It would be easy to dismiss the fills of such pits as evidence of rubbish disposal, and the ephemeral layering of ash and charcoal, sand and clay, as nonchalant dumping (19/o9 in particular was filled very quickly; the relative dates of these fills might prompt association with wider events on site).48 But these particular objects suggest something more complex. The disposal of all materials is subject to social rules. I have suggested elsewhere that the burial of sundry items in 19/09 was conducted according to some rule of procedure which involved the inclusion of symbolic items, in this case the sword.49 Perhaps the most compelling evidence is another sherd from a Panathenaic amphora, found in pit 19/04 [1025] and inscribed 'EcKaactLog A' (Hekataios [offers this] to Zeus) (PLATE 26 b).50 Each deposit was preceded by the disposal of a burnt offering. Pit 19/09 produced animal remains that included scarce species, i.e. hare and at least two species of bird, one probably domestic fowl, the other probably goose (either domestic or wild), reminiscent of what has already been described for pit 19/21. Pit 19/22 yielded worked astragali (one pig, one cattle), together with some extremely young bones: this time from at least one newborn piglet and one newborn lamb or kid. Some of the domestic fowl bones were also from a young individual. Pit 19/02 context [1021] produced the articulating remains of partial carcasses of cattle and sheep, apparently mixed in with food refuse. The remains include a complete adult sheep's head, which may have been fully fleshed when it was deposited in the pit. The mature sheep limb bones, however, had been butchered and probably defleshed. In contrast, the skull of an immature sheep had been butchered whilst its limb bones were intact (which is unusual for this site). There were also some articulating foot bones from quite a large dog, a piece of worked red deer antler, and occasional bones of hare and domestic fowl. When all the bones 47 Samples of these putative organic deposits are undergoing analysis in the University of Liverpool. 48 It might be tempting to link the date of all three fills, c. 300 BC, with cleaning up operations following the extensive destruction of various parts of the site at the end of period 2.

The most interesting faunal discovery from this pit concerns the scorched and articulating remains of cattle jaws and lower limbs, possibly all from a single beast. The remains do not represent a complete carcass: the torso (comprising the vertebrae and ribs) is missing. Both jaws are present, and both have been scorched and broken through the diastema. Similarly, three legs are represented by the lower elements: the radius and ulna of a forelimb and the tibia from both hind limbs. These have all been chopped through just above the wrist or ankle joint. All the elements from here down to the hooves are present and can be rearticulated, even though all three metapodials have been scorched and broken through midshaft (PLATE 27 a). Fine knife marks indicate that the skin was removed from the lower limb bones (which bear extremely little meat), presumably before the metapodials were charred and broken. The pieces were obviously gathered up with care and all placed in the pit together, but they were not found in anatomical position. Upper limb bones from cattle in this pit (possibly the same animal, although this cannot be assumed nor demonstrated), have been butchered in the usual way for this site and may represent food refuse. The scorching and breakage of cattle lower limb bones and mandibles has been observed by the author at other sites (including Roman military sites in northern England that were manned by auxiliary troops originating from central and eastern Europe). It has also been recorded by other authors, at sites ranging from Roman to medieval in date, and has usually been interpreted as a practical way of extracting the marrow from the bones. The manner of deposition in pit 19/02 suggests that, in this case, the purpose was more ritualistic than utilitarian. Although it may be a culturally related practice, it is certainly not the normal treatment of cattle lower-limb bones, even at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa, and the distribution of this pattern of treatment requires further investigation, both at the site and within the wider region. Unlined pits These circular or subcircular pits (19/oi, 19/04, 19/05, i9/o7, 19/O8, I9/10, 19/II, 19/17, 19/18) which form cylindrical cuts with flat bottoms, are similar in many ways to the lined versions (0.93-1-70 m in diameter, defined as ashy grey circles filled with fired clay and charcoal), but are shallower (maximum depth 0.14-0.60 m) and generally contained fewer finds. The most remarkable was I9/oI [Io68, o10851], which contained virtually no finds other than a complete iron sword at the centre of the base (PLATE 28 a). A sizeable heap of hot charcoal and ash seems to have been shovelled into pit I9/I8 [Io5I, 1052] (PLATE 29 a). The one exception to the above is a very deep pit [Io67, io88], filled with a soft, grey crumbly loam, of which 2.60 m were cleared. It may be a well head.5' Small pits A sequence of seven small pits (19/12 [1017, 1018], 19/13 [1041, 1042], 19/14 [1043, 10441, 19/15 [1045, 1046], 19/16 [Io471, 19/19 [I053], and 19/20 [io55, 1056]) was found in the north-west corner of the grid square, surrounding two larger ones (I9/1o [1037] and 19/11[1039]). These small pits varied in size from 0.24 X 0.27 m (19/13) to i m (19/15), and in section from a cleft o.o8 m deep (19/I3), to a semi- circular bowl, 0.71 m deep (19/20). Notwithstanding the variety of forms, they all contained a similar type of fill, a crumbly, grey loam, with virtually no finds, which makes them hard to date. The absence of finds suggests that they were deliberately back filled with soil, rather than becoming filled with occupation debris. One (19/13), possibly more, could have been postholes.

They were quite distinct from the larger pits in colour (paler) as well as size and shape. STRATIGRAPHY AND CHRONOLOGY The surviving section at the northern end of quadrat D24 provides important data about the overall history of the site in this area (PLATE 22 b; FIG. 5). The spatial characteristics of the levels identified here will be explored in future years. Below the topsoil, archaeological deposits appear to narrow from the ground upwards. Close inspection confirms that adjacent strata have been removed artificially. The erosion of strata on the western slope is probably due to long term river damage.52 At the eastern end, ancient levels accumulate in this direction, but have been cut away by modern machine disturbance. The earliest stratum overlying sterile soil in quadrats DI9 and D24 is a thick, heavily compacted, pale greyish brown deposit, context [oo004], up to 0o.43 m deep, containing sand, crumbly silts, and ashy loam. It corresponds to the lowest layer identified by M. Domaradzki in quadrats EI9, E25, A5 and BI, on the western (inner) side of the fortification wall, in its excavated northern section as far as the eastern gateway.53 In D24, this layer does not, as yet, contain any built structures, although building debris, including burnt bricks, as well as tiles, have been found. A curious concave feature (contexts [io6i, io66, 1069]), resembling a near horizontal flue of fired clay, was found to be rather ephemeral, although its ashy contents, mixed liberally with charcoal, did extend into a keyhole-shaped, ashy layer, filled with pot. Pits 19/21 and 19/22 damaged the northern extremities of this feature, but there is no evidence of heavy firing, as would be expected in the vicinity of a kiln. At present this must be interpreted as a dump of very hot ash and pot, although the slump of deposits which accumulated on top of it ([Io82, Io83, 1084]), may point to the collapse of organic material above the pot dump. The range of imported shapes and local fabrics represented by this dump is 52 A geological fault, perhaps of recent origin, was detected at the bottom of pit i9/o0 during excavation. It emphasizes the comparative instability of the western terrace edge, and makes it even more likely that sections have fallen away in the past (see the geophysical report below). 53 Domaradzki, 'Interim', 17-i9, and figs. I. 5, 1. 7 (sections); the greyish brown deposit or 'grey layer' in these quadrats contained material corresponding to phases I and 2, i.e. second half of the 5th to second half of the 4th c. BC. He does not discuss the cut for the wall as such. The deposit he refers to is deeper close to the gateway, but falls away in a northerly direction. In EI9, west of the wall, it is c. 0o.3-0o.4 m thick, and thus has a depth similar to what survives in D24, 40 m further west.</page><page sequence="21">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA 329 noticeably earlier than ceramics from the pit fills already described, and confirms Domaradzki's analysis of this stratum as belonging to phases I and 2 (or parts thereof). In the north eastern sector of the site, the first hundred years seem, on present evidence, to have been an uninterrupted period of building and other less easily specified activities. Stratigraphy above the thick greyish brown layer is much more highly differentiated than is the case adjacent to the fortification wall. Some o.7o-o.80 m of deposits overlie this initial layer, of varying depth, none more than o.i m (apart from the dark brown fill, context [Io76], up to 0.46 m). A pattern of periodic inundations is represented by clear layers of yellow or greenish sand and gravel. A series of these, apparently in close succession, occurs half way up (contexts [1014, 1057, 1058]), followed by substantial reoccupation [Io70], further inundation, and successive reoccupation [1072, 1073, 1074]. This suggests a more complex history during the site's third phase, which has hitherto been regarded as far less dramatic than the first two. Pit I9/09 was filled no later than 300 BC; 19/21 and 19/22 contained fills which are broadly contemporary. These pits were cut into deposits between major inundations, either slightly before or slightly after the major silt and sand layer, context [o104], which has a highly distinctive, bright yellow tone. The most significant alluvial deposits occurred during the third century BC. More precise dating will emerge, once local ceramic sequences are better understood. But these floods were succeeded by active reorganization and reconstruction. Although architecturally less ambitious, the third phase may nevertheless have been both productive and highly active.54 Investigations in the southern sector tend to confirm this impression. EXCAVATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN SECTOR, TRENCH B21 The deposits excavated to date comprise a series of isolated pits and dumped deposits associated with phase 3 on the settlement (after 30oo BC). Traces of a lightly constructed building were present, probably made of clay and timber with clay floors. Dumps of domestic rubbish were cut through by a group of large pits, at least one of which may be a well. The excavated deposits are described in stratigraphic sequence starting with the oldest. The division of the stratigraphy into phases is provisional and may be subject to revision once a more detailed analysis has been conducted of the finds evidence. PHASE I The earliest deposits exposed so far are lenses of sandy material in the north-west and south- east corners of the trench (contexts [61] and [65]; FIG. 6).55 These have an as yet undetermined relationship with an extensive deposit of greyish brown sandy loam that covers much of the trench. This deposit is visible in the sides of excavated cut features and is up to 0.5 m thick. Context [61] was cut by an oval pit [5], o.65 m deep, cut for the insertion of a pithos, context [31. The pithos had collapsed in on itself as a result of pressure from surrounding deposits. The fill [2] consisted of a mid-brown sandy loam, very similar to the surrounding deposits. The contents are summarized in TABLE I. Several very large pithos sherds, including substantial fragments of rim, were found lying further east, and may have belonged to the same vessel, dispersed as a result of ploughing.56 54 See Domaradzki (n. 35), on part-manufactured 'Celtic' type fibulae. 55 These have not yet been excavated, and may turn out to be a single deposit, perhaps related to similar features noted in the SW corner of the trench. 56 The exact mechanism for the insertion of the pithos is not clear. The upper portion of the cut was obscured, partly by root and animal disturbance, and partly by the collapse of the vessel itself.</page><page sequence="22">330 ZOFIA H.

Context 61 was sealed by contexts [48], [491, [51], and [58], constituting a single deposit, c. 0.2 m thick, composed of mid-greyish brown sandy loam, and containing frequent small rounded pebbles and charcoal flecks. The finds from these contexts are summarised in TABLE 2. Most of the ceramic material was present as large sherds with fresh, unabraded breaks. Several were near complete vessels and in a few cases joining sherds were found close together. This suggests that these deposits accumulated quickly and were not subjected to a prolonged period of weathering or trampling by animals or humans. The finds suggest that most of this material was domestic debris from occupation. Two pits were cut into deposit [48]. Context [59] was located in the centre of the trench and was excavated following the removal of layer [48]. However, a persistent dark stain with very poorly defined edges had been noted in this area earlier in the excavation; it is likely that this feature was in fact cut from higher in the stratigraphy. The cut was subcircular in plan, and had an asymmetric profile with a steep, near vertical northern edge; the southern edge sloped at c. 30o and was slightly convex. The base was flattish. The fill was a mid- brown sandy silt containing occasional charcoal flecks and small cobbles up to 40 mm across. It was filled with similar material to the surrounding deposits. The presence of several large fragments of pithos and roof tile up to 0.4 m across suggests that this feature had been back filled deliberately rather than allowed to gradually silt up. A second, circular(?) pit [52], was located against the southern edge of the excavation and was c.

PHASE II Cut [38] (FIG. 7) was aligned west-north-west to east-south-east, and could be stratigraphically contemporary with [54], [22], and [25]. However, it was cut by the well, so it is likely to be earlier. The cut was c. 2.2 m long, 1.15 m wide, and 0.45 m deep. It was filled with dumped domestic material (context 30), containing large (up to 0.3 m) fragments of freshly broken, unabraded pottery, tile, and bone (TABLE 3). Nearly all the larger fragments were laid flat against the sides of the cut. In some places this was the main means by which the sides of the cut could be identified. Several large (up to o.3m) rounded cobbles were also present, in the bottom of a hollow, in the base of the cut, which was c. 0.25 m across. These may have served as packing for a timber post. The exact interpretation of this feature is not clear. The black sandy loam, pottery and tile probably represent dumping of domestic occupation debris. The relatively clear edges to the</page><page sequence="25">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA 333 cut suggest that this feature had not been open very long before being filled. It may have originated from the robbing of building stone for use elsewhere. Alternatively it may be associated with the north-south-aligned ditch in squares BI7 and B22.57 TABLE 3.

These were cut by [54], a linear feature extending for 4.00 m from the west facing section and 0.2-0o.5 m wide, 0.1-0.2 m deep. This represents the only well-defined structural feature within the trench, probably the wall of a building with the interior to the south. The cut was filled by context [45], a pale brown gritty sandy loam, distinguished from the surrounding deposits by the presence of several large stone blocks which seemed to have been deposited within the fill.

However, a 0.2 m thick layer of clayey, silty sand (context [32]) to the south of [54], is interpreted as make-up for a floor which would make this area the interior of the building. There was no convincing evidence that cut [38] was of structural origin. A small section of clay hearth (context [65]) at the south end of cut [54] was probably part of this structure. The surviving section measured 0.5 X 0.3 m and was IO-20 mm thick. It was constructed upon a base of crushed amphora sherds (context [66]) from a single vessel. Cut [84] was located c. 2.5 m to the north of cut [54] and was subcircular in plan, 2-2.1 m in diameter and at least 2.o m deep. Excavation of this feature, which contains a complex sequence of fills is not yet complete; it is possible that it is a back-filled well. Almost parallel with the eastern section of the trench, contexts 22 and 25 may well have been a single feature, separated by an intrusive cut (context [6]). These deposits were composed of large quantities of fired clay set in a matrix of dark, reddish brown, sandy loam.

However no trace of a cut could be found, and the fired clay, which largely defined these contexts, merged gradually with the deposits to the east. Several hearth fragments were noted in this general area during the excavation of the underlying deposits and it is possible that this feature was not fully excavated. A clay zoomorphic figurine was embedded among the hearth fragments of [22] (PLATES 29 b- 30 a). PHASE IV Sealing these deposits was a c. o.I-0.2 m thick layer of dark, greyish brown, loamy sand (context [14]; FIG. 9). Although colour changes could be seen within this deposit, none were sufficiently well defined in plan to enable them to be excavated with any degree of confidence, and it is likely that this deposit was very heavily disturbed by animal activity. Some of the features discussed above could actually have been cut through these deposits, but not recognized because of the dry conditions.</page><page sequence="28">336 ZOFIA H. ARCHIBALD Context [i7] in the north-west of the trench contained large quantities of broken roof tile. It was very similar in colour to context [30o], and may actually have been the upper fill of that feature, disturbed by a combination of ploughing, animal activity, and root disturbance. All these contexts contained large fragments of pottery. Some of this material occurred in tight clusters, which could be reconstructed to form parts of whole vessels. This suggests that the post-depositional disturbance discussed above was not significant. It also indicates that this area of the site was not subject to significant trampling during the accumulation of these deposits. Some of the vessels occurred as small stacks of sherds, up to three deep. This would seem to suggest that these pieces were carefully placed rather than being dumped as part of the process of rubbish disposal. These deposits were cut by a group of four pits (contexts [7], [13], [16], and [35]), C. 1.5 m in diameter, and I-2.o m deep. All these features had steep, near vertical sides, and flat bases. They were filled with black, humic, silty sand, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding deposits in their upper half. There is no clear pattern to the layout of these features, though this may be because only a limited area was available for excavation; long alignments would not be identifiable in such a small area. The fills of some of these features were slightly less compacted that the surrounding deposits, which might indicate that they are significantly later than the other contexts excavated in this trench. This, together with the difficulty encountered in identifying the edges of cuts, hints that they are connected with modern agricultural activity, such as the planting of vines. This conclusion is supported by the presence of several thick roots in fill [41]. The pits were sealed by a o.I-o.2 m thick layer of loose, humic silty sand which was dark greyish brown in colour, and contained a wide range of pottery, tile, metal finds, rounded cobbles of schist and granite up to Ioo mm across. This deposit probably represents ploughsoil or its local equivalent. CONCLUSIONS In trench B21, during phase 3 at Vetren, occupation debris was successively dumped in this sector, followed by an ultimate sequence of insubstantial timber buildings, albeit hard to identify and interpret. The walls of these buildings were aligned north-west to south-east, i.e. following a different orientation from that of stone structures excavated further north, either side of the east-west road. The only exception to this is the possible structure represented by the accumulations of hearth material. The concentration of roof tiles in the north-west corner of the trench may represent the collapsed roof from one of these structures, though the highly fragmentary state of this material rather suggests that tiles were reused to make up a floor. The substantial accumulations of debris represented by contexts [27], [48], [58] etc. may have been deposited relatively quickly. Much of the pottery consists of large, unabraded fragments and joining sherds, that were frequently found very close together, occasionally as small stacks. This suggests that the deposits were not subject to trampling by animals or exposed to weathering for prolonged periods.58 The assemblage seems to be dominated by domestic coarse wares, amphorae, and orangewares. Therefore these deposits seem to have originated from the disposal of domestic debris, a conclusion supported by the presence of domestic artefacts such as loomweights, spindle whorls, knife blades and needles. Very little industrial waste was present in comparison with other areas of the site during the same phase, 58 There appears to have been a substantial degree of post- depositional mixing, caused by animal burrows and plant roots, several large voids (some up to 0.20o m across) were noted, and areas of mottling are likely to have resulted from the silting up of similar features.</page><page sequence="29">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA 337 which suggests that these deposits had different sources. Very little of the pottery retains traces of burning, so domestic refuse does not seem to have been burnt prior to disposal. The wattle impressions on the fired clay objects provide little information with regard to the nature of the structure or structures, but do suggest management, perhaps even coppicing of local woodland, to provide a suitable supply of timber. Distinctive layers of silty sand and gravel have been noted at various locations on site, vestigially in E25,59 just below the ploughsoil, in the vicinity of the fortification wall (c. o.I-0.12 m in depth); much more noticeably on the western periphery of the terrace, in D24 and the quadrats immediately south of it, AIA and A5A, where several distinct flood horizons occurred, well below the modern topsoil.6o In trench B21, similar deposits have only just begun to emerge, and at much lower depth. This suggests that the area behind the suite of shops or warehouses lining the main road was used far less intensively until the end of the fourth century BC. The domestic character of this sector contrasts with the cultic imprint apparent north-west of the main road, in the vicinity of the decorated altars/hearths (quadrats A5A, A6), including quadrats DI9, D24, as well as south of the road (especially quadrats B'2, B'7). FINDS The greatest concentration of roof tiles in trench B21 was in the north-west corner. All the identifiable fragments were pan tiles of Corinthian type, the kalypteroi of Laconian type, and very heavily broken. Although distinct concentrations were noted, the heavily fragmented nature of the tiles suggests that these deposits do not represent the collapsed roofs of timber structures.6' It is more likely that, in this trench at least, there is some kind of secondary use, possibly make-up for truncated floor levels. The comparative range and quantity of finds in the two excavated areas reinforces the contrast between them. In B2I architectural ceramics (170.2 kg) and tile (367 kg), together with storage pithoi (303.6 kg), exceed the same categories from the excavated parts of DI9 and D24 (43.32 kg, 40.7 kg, 47-78 kg respectively) by several factors, whereas the quantity of bone in DI9, D24 (15.8 kg) exceeds that in B21 (15.4 kg).62 Further analysis of the quantitative data will help to clarify these differences. Both areas were rich in metal finds, including iron blades (PLATES 25 a, 28 b), nails, copper alloy pins, fibulae (PLATE 28 d), wire, small sheets or strips, and coins. The commonest finds were ceramic. The proportion of what are most likely to be considered local products (judging by the distinctive quartz and iron inclusions in the clay), greatly exceed imported items, including imported amphorae, in all contexts. This pattern seems to prevail in contexts belonging to periods 2 and 3; contexts belonging exclusively to period I are not yet available for study. Residual fifth-century-BC Attic imports are easy to pick out. Contemporary local wares are much harder to identify at present. The commonest finds other than vessel fragments are loomweights. Pyramidal and fiddle- or purse-shaped weights are found in broadly equal numbers in B21, and the same proportions are reflected more widely at Vetren.63 The pyramidal form is the commonest shape in the Classical Aegean, 59 Domaradzki, 'Interim', 17; id., 'Interim 2' for further discussion. 6o Quadrats AIA and A5A are currently being excavated under the direction of G. Lazov. Gravel and sand deposits have been documented between successive stone pavings of the east-west road (D. Katin'arova's excavations). 61 As argued byJ.

ARCHIBALD while the fiddle-shaped weights have a northern distribution in Thrace, Thasos and Macedonia. The third variety is lenticular, with two holes and a biconical profile. Rare fragments of moulded clay, including the eye and cheek of a woman's head (a gorgon? PLATE 28 c), show that more ambitious artistic pieces should be expected, alongside simpler architectural ornaments, gaming counters, and miniature loaves, or other food items. Fired clay 'hearths' Among items made from fired clay, fragments of low altars or hearths form a special category of their own. Numerous fragments of hearths and associated items were present in most contexts. All were re-deposited fragments, no in situ hearths were excavated. The vast majority of such fragments were found in trench B21. Context [25] contained twenty-four pieces, probably from the same hearth; all are composed of the same fabric (a coarse, medium red, well fired clay with c. 2.5% angular inclusions of a hard, white mineral, probably quartz), and are of similar thickness (PLATE 29 b). The total weight was o.86 kg. The fabric retained very frequent impressions from a coarse grass or straw temper. One surface was slightly grayer and more worn. This was probably the upper surface, as it was slightly smoother than the other, and occasional pieces retained traces of decoration in the form of a single, straight incised line c. I-2 mm across. In addition to the hearth fragments, context [25] contained two monolithic blocks of fired clay which join to form a single object 367 mm long, c. 105 mm at its widest and weighing 1.94 kg. The fabric was very similar to that of the hearths. The object had a roughly triangular profile, though one face was deeply concave on a radius of c. 6o-8o mm. This face was rough and unfinished, retaining traces of straw or grass temper. It appears to have been formed by pressing the wet clay against a rounded timber. The other two faces are flat and lie at an angle of c. 8o0 to each other. Where the join between them survives it is crisp and neatly finished. One surface is slightly greyer and more worn looking than the other, which suggests that this may have been more exposed during the object's use. The grey discoloration is similar to that seen on the upper surface of the hearth. The redder face retains a 65 mm length of its junction with the rear, concave face. The junction has been neatly finished by rounding it off on a radius of c. 5 mm. Although both faces have been finished by smoothing, they retain frequent traces of the grass/straw temper. The exact function of this object is not clear. It may have been part of the hearth excavated, perhaps even forming part of a deeper rim around its edge. Context [22] contained a total of 27 fragments of fired clay (4.02 kg) in a fabric almost identical with that of the hearth fragments described above. However, these fragments were clearly from a much more substantial structure, the thickest pieces being up to 6o mm deep. The largest pieces measured c. 120 X 120 mm, the smallest 25 X 25 X 20 mm. All of them had a fresh, unabraded appearance, and had been deposited shortly after demolition. They may have constituted a vertical wall to the hearth in [251.64 Context [48] contained several fragments of fired clay, mostly small, non-diagnostic abraded sections in a fabric similar to the hearth. The largest fragment was the terminal section of a hearth kerb excavated immediately to the east (within 0.25 m) of context [2] and may have been displaced from the pithos fill by ploughing. It is in four joining pieces, the breaks are fresh and consistent with excavation damage. The overall shape is subrectangular, the joined pieces measure 2Io X 16o X 72 mm and it is clear that these represent a fragment of a larger object, broken off along one of the longer narrow faces. The vertical sides are all 64 Cf. E.

The join with the hearth is represented by a rough, broken area c. 30 mm wide which extends around the base of the object. The sides are roughly smoothed, faint traces of finger impressions are visible and impressions of the organic temper are also present. The upper surface has been similarly finished. The internal fabric is very similar to that of the hearth fragments described above, though no trace of the grey reduced fabric was present. Context [48] also contained a fragment from a monolithic block and other fragments which may be from the same kerb as the terminal section; they were in a similar fabric and of a similar thickness. Numerous other small fragments were present, many with wattle impressions, similar to those discussed above. Clay statuette (PLATES 29 b, 30 a) This object was found deposited with the hearth material in context [25]. It is 198 mm long and a maximum of 86 mm wide, narrowing to 27 mm at the front of the upper end. It is 160 mm in height and its longitudinal profile is raised and prow-like with a c. 90 mm long 'tail' at the rear. The rear end was broken before burial, though otherwise it has a remarkably fresh, unworn appearance. The break also has a fresh appearance suggesting that the object was broken shortly before deposition. It appears to have been carefully smoothed by wiping with a cloth or fine brush prior to firing. Traces of very fine striations can be seen on limited areas of some surfaces. The base is generally flat but has been hollowed out prior to firing. The hollow starts c. 28 mm from the front and is 40-5 mm wide, increasing in width towards the broken end. It is c. 8-io mm deep and is rounded in plan at the front end. The sides of the depression are gently concave and slope at c. 45 1 to give a gentle, dish-shaped profile. This surface has several deep irregular cracks, which are probably the result of drying prior to firing. The sides are parallel at the broken, rear end, the profile in plan narrows gradually towards the front of the object where it is 76 mm wide. The vertical profiles of the sides are slightly convex. The front has a similar profile in both planes. The upper surface is decorated with two deeply incised lines with 4-2 mm deep, semi- circular profiles, which become shallower towards the front and top of the object. On the object's front they have a slightly steeper profile. Although generally parallel, one of the grooves exhibits a slight wiggle. It is possible that both were incised using a finger whilst the clay was still moist. The head is pierced by a hole with a minimum diameter of 26 mm, flaring out on both sides to c. 40 mm. The fabric is very similar to that seen in the hearth fragments from this context, though it appears to be slightly better fired and lacking in the organic temper seen in the hearth. It is mid- reddish brown in colour though small patches on all surfaces are slightly blackened. It is not clear if this was caused during firing, use or as a result of post-depositional alteration. The clay contains numerous (5-io%) small, white inclusions 1-2 mm across. It is likely that these are of quartz. A single larger (5 mm) inclusion seen on the upper surface appears to be burnt quartz. Very occasional (&lt;i%) inclusions of a cherry red mineral, possibly haematite, can also be seen. GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTION (1992-4, 1999-2001) THE AIMS OF THE GEOPHYSICAL WORK AND THE TECHNIQUES USED An initial pilot survey was undertaken in 1992 and set the aims for the fieldwork undertaken during the following two seasons, 1993 and 1994, which in turn guided the work undertaken in 1999 and 2001.

The second aim was to look at the broader landscape in an attempt to identify the extent of settlement area(s) and investigate land-use patterns beyond. For the preliminary investigations two techniques were employed: magnetic susceptibility (MS) sampling and fluxgate gradiometry. Both techniques were successful, and in May 2ool further gradiometer data were collected, and MS undertaken over the lower terrace to the north of the canal. The 1999 season had the primary aim of attempting to establish the southern and south- western limits of the site on the lower terrace. We attempted to achieve this by using electrical imaging and detailed gradiometry. While this area is known to have significant alluvial deposits, it is uncertain whether these overlie archaeological remains, or whether subsequent river action has destroyed this section of the site. This part of the research had three aims: to assess the depth and extent of alluvial deposits, identify any river channels, and to locate any anomalies of possible archaeological interest. Due to the nature of the data collected over the years, the results will be discussed by technique rather than by season. FIG. IO shows the location of all the geophysical investigations undertaken. MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY (1992, 1993 AND 2001) The basis of magnetic susceptibility is the presence in soils of naturally occurring iron oxide. When an external magnetic field is applied to the soil, a reaction occurs at the atomic level within the iron oxide and the sample displays a temporary induced magnetism whose strength can be measured. Magnetic susceptibility is expressed as a ratio of the strengths of the induced and applied magnetic fields. Measurement of magnetic susceptibility can be carried out in two ways. Firstly, a field coil allows rapid measurement of large areas. One disadvantage of this method is the poor penetration (c. Io cm) of the signal; moreover, it gives a bulk, i.e. volume, measurement of soil, stones, air and water. The second technique is the laboratory determination of the susceptibility for a standard volume or mass. The latter gives a truer measurement of soil susceptibility, as the samples are dried, and the coarse fraction (all materials, such as stones and foreign bodies, over 2 mm in diameter) is excluded by sieving. Both methods were used on this site, although the majority were obtained using a Bartington field coil. The results show all the measurements, after conversion to enable comparison of the volume and mass susceptibility measurements. MS sampling was initially undertaken over a broad area to assess its suitability and followed up by more detailed survey. The final data set covers an area of approximately 20o ha, and is displayed in FIG. ii. The results from the MS survey indicate a coherent data set with a generally high level of background response, which has been attributed a natural origin, on the upper terrace. The values are considerably lower on the lower terrace, which is not surprising given the greater depth of alluvium. The majority of readings on the upper terrace fall in the range of 8o to 1Io SI. These are taken to indicate the background susceptibility at the site, and the small variations within this range are attributed natural origins. The background values are high; it is thought that igneous components within the alluvial deposits, as well as more recent agricultural practices, have contributed to the observed levels. However, without data from other sites in Bulgaria, and more precise information on the soil history of the site, it is not possible to assess whether the readings obtained represent a 'normal' background for the region. However, two concentrations of high susceptibility values (over 200oo SI) are apparent in the data. The first lies within the 100oo m grid square 3700, 1400 and the</page><page sequence="34">342 ZOFIA H.

These are discrete areas suggesting they may be archaeologically significant. It should be stressed that the results do not necessarily indicate the absolute limits of the site, although they may define core areas of human habitation and activity.65 GRADIOMETRY (1992, 1999 AND 2001) The basis for magnetic prospecting is the presence of magnetized iron oxides in the soil. Depending on the state of iron oxides, the material will exhibit either a weak or a strong magnetization. Two phenomena are relevant in the production of magnetic anomalies: thermo-remanence and magnetic susceptibility. Thermo-remanence describes weakly magnetic materials that have been heated, and thus acquired a permanent magnetization, associated with the direction of the magnetic field within which they cooled. Archaeological features that have been through this mechanism include baked clay hearths and kilns. However, there is a complication on this site, as this same property renders igneous material magnetic, and can confuse interpretation of data. However, any buried walls or foundations constructed of igneous material should produce a strong, coherent, magnetic signal. Similarly palaeochannels usually produce a characteristic magnetic response due to the magnetic gravels within such deposits. Anthropogenic activity generally increases susceptibility, and 65 M.

Results of the gradiometer survey. even in the absence of a heating mechanism of enhancement, detectable features can be produced, for example, by the infilling of a ditch with relatively enhanced topsoil materials. Anomalies that are of interest are the product of the relative contrasts between the subsoil and the magnetically enhanced topsoil. Investigations on this site were conducted using a Geoscan FM36 Fluxgate Gradiometer. This instrument comprises two fluxgates mounted vertically apart, at a distance of 500 mm. The gradiometer is carried by hand, with the bottom sensor approximately 1oo-3oo mm from the ground surface. At each survey station, the difference in the magnetic field between the two fluxgates is measured in nanoTesla (nT). The fluxgate gradiometer suppresses any diurnal or regional effects. Generally, features up to I m deep may be detected using this method. While archaeological remains are known to be at some depth below the alluvium on the lower terrace, it was hoped that substantially enhanced features, such as walls constructed from igneous material, or hearths, might be detectable at such depths. Readings were logged at 0.5 m intervals along traverses I.o m apart. Between 1992 and 2001, gradiometer data covering c. 11 ha have been collected and are displayed in FIG. 12, with an accompanying interpretation diagram in FIG. 13. The magnetic results are generally noisy and have been divided into three broad categories: ?archaeological, ?natural, and modern. Numbers have been used to highlight specific anomalies. In 1992 an area adjacent to the then main excavation was investigated, Area I, with the aim of establishing the extent of the fortification wall and any associated archaeological features. The strongest magnetic anomalies are associated with the fortification wall (I), which has been partially excavated and is constructed of igneous material. The southern limit of the wall is</page><page sequence="36">344 ZOFIA H. ARCHIBALD ,-Als 2 Area 4 0 80 _77, Azq.3--~ca ?Arcbielogy MNatu Modemn  5 Area 6 3800 1000 FIG. 13. Interpretation of the gradiometer survey. clearly shown on the interpretation. There are no indications of the wall extending beyond the modern trackway. In 2001 further survey was undertaken to confirm this (see Area 2). Owing to the magnetic nature of the igneous material on site, it is relatively easy to identify 'stray' boulders and building stones, although it is impossible to differentiate between the two, unless the latter form a recognizable pattern. As a result, all isolated responses are noted as possibly natural on the interpretation plan. Excavation of one of the anomalies found the presence of a large boulder, thus confirming such an interpretation. Elsewhere in the survey area, there are several linear magnetic anomalies, which are difficult to interpret. The responses would appear to suggest the existence of silted ditches, but given the highly magnetic soil, natural bands of more magnetic material could be responsible for some of the observed anomalies. Trial excavation over one of the linears confirmed the presence of a ditch-type feature, whereas elsewhere excavation only found natural variations in the subsoil. The differentiation on the interpretation plan between ?natural and ?archaeological for such anomalies is tentative and based on strength, form and alignment. Area 2 was investigated immediately to the north-west of Area i, with the aim of examining the continuation of the fortification wall, visible in gradiometer data collected to the south-east. The data are dominated by parallel linear trends, aligned NW-SE, and are consistent with modern ploughing. Several irregular, broadly positive anomalies are visible in the north of the survey area, and are almost certainly of natural origin. These are typical of responses from concentrations of gravel associated with palaeochannels, although they may be due to extensive landscaping, involving redistribution of material in recent</page><page sequence="37">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA 345 times."66 In the southern half of this survey area there are relatively discrete areas of strong response, which suggest a concentration of igneous material. Although there are no recognizable patterns within the data, and in particular no suggestion of the fortification wall, they may indicate masonry remains or debris, possibly plough damaged archaeological remains. Their form certainly differs from the responses in the north, and as a result they are noted as potentially archaeologically significant. Area 3 covers an area of general interest to the east of the existing excavations. The data can be broadly divided into quieter responses to the south of the road, and much higher levels of magnetic enhancement to the north. Some weak responses are visible in the south of the survey area, but these appear to reflect natural variations, and possibly modern irrigation channels. Strong linear anomalies (2) have been identified to the north of the modern road. These broadly coincide with areas of enhanced magnetic susceptibility recorded in 1992 and 1993, The form of these anomalies suggests an archaeological origin. However, the increased magnetic response between them is more consistent with a natural or modern origin. While a few discrete responses have been noted within this area, there is no real coherent form to the responses, which supports a natural origin, such as a palaeochannel. It is difficult to place this anomaly in a topographic context, as substantial earth movement and landscaping has taken place over the years. It seems likely that the recorded responses may be due to material imported to infill an old river valley.67 A strong pit-type response (3) is visible in the north of the survey area immediately outside the presumed palaeochannel. The response is characteristic of a pit filled with very enhanced magnetic material, or possibly a burnt or fired feature. However, as noted above, a natural origin, such as an igneous boulder cannot be dismissed. Several linear trends are also apparent in the data including a series aligned SW-NE and NW-SE. Although an archaeological origin cannot be discounted, it seems likely that they relate to agricultural activity, as they are consistent with the ploughing trends visible in Area 2. Area 4, which lies just to north of Area 3, covers an area of increased magnetic susceptibility readings. It was hoped that the gradiometer survey would establish whether the increased magnetic susceptibility is associated with cultural material. There is a 'core' of magnetic anomalies, which, at the time of survey in 1992, appeared archaeological in nature. Nevertheless, given the results from Area 3, collected in 2001, a natural or modern origin seems more plausible. However, the possibility that the anomalies indicate plough-damaged archaeological deposits cannot be ruled out. In the east there are linear responses, which form a boundary to this group of responses, while the western limits are not so well defined. These trends are on a comparable alignment to those seen in the east of Areas 2 and 3, which point to an agricultural origin. The whole of the lower terrace to the north of the canal, Area 5, was investigated by gradiometry. The results indicate a generally quiet level of background response, compared to Areas 1-4. Numerous diffuse magnetic anomalies, typical of those generated by natural features, such as palaeochannels, are visible in the west. Most striking is a pair of curving natural responses (4) toward the centre of the survey area, which appear to continue south of the canal. This suggests a meandering river channel with the meander being some 12o m across and the channel itself being of the order of 20 m wide. It seems likely that all the anomalies within the survey area are associated with pedological variations or modern irrigation features. However, there is a suggestion of a rectilinear anomaly (5) approximately 66 D. Weston, 'Alluvium and geophysical prospection: a brief research note' (in press). 67 Cf.

An archaeological interpretation is extremely cautious given the expected depth of archaeological deposits on the lower terrace. It may be a coincidental arrangement of modern and/or natural features. However, a substantial structure, at depth, comprising igneous material could, theoretically, produce such a weak and diffuse anomaly. The data collected to the south of the canal, Area 6, are dominated by pipes; several areas could not be investigated because of structures associated with the pumping station. In the west of the survey, many possibly archaeologically significant anomalies have been located. These include several linear responses (6) which may relate to buried archaeological features such as a ditch or wall containing igneous or fired material. However, a modern origin such as cultivation cannot be excluded. The continuation of the possible palaeochannel (4) is also apparent. One clearly defined linear anomaly (7), aligned NE-SW, in the east of the survey area has been identified. Ordinarily such a response would be considered potentially archaeologically significant, either indicating a ditch or possibly a wall comprising igneous material. There are, however, three points of concern. (I) The north-easterly continuation of this anomaly coincides with the canal, (2) The anomaly crosses an area of stones and overgrown vegetation in the south of the survey area; while this may be coincidental, it could indicate an inspection point or similar, (3) Although the response does not indicate a metal or plastic pipe, the anomaly could be produced by a concrete pipe containing igneous material. Parts of pipes of this type are visible on the surface, although it is of interest that no comparable anomalies have been noted elsewhere. ELECTRICAL IMAGING (1999) This technique aims to build up a picture of electrical current along different paths by measuring associated voltages. Across a homogeneous medium, a uniform resistivity would be recorded. Buried features, such as an infilled channel, or archaeological features, will distort the electric field and alter the current paths within the ground. As a result, anomalous areas of high and low resistance can be measured over buried features, providing there is sufficient electrical contrast between the target and the material in which it is buried. The survey was carried out using a Campus Tigre Imaging System. Data are collected by inserting metal probes a short distance into the ground, at equal distances along a straight line, referred to as a traverse. These are then connected to a switching box and resistance meter, which is controlled by a laptop computer. 68 The results from each traverse are displayed as a vertical section. Successive traverses are collected to build up an image of the subsurface. One concern with the electrical imaging technique is the loss of lateral resolution at depth. As a result, a compromise between depth of investigation and lateral resolution has to be reached. Initially, three traverses, at 5 m intervals, were undertaken, followed by traverses with electrodes, at 2 m intervals. As expected, the 5 m traverse provide useful general information, but the lateral resolution was insufficient for the aims of this project. Whilst a 2 m electrode spacing only gathers data to approximately 6 m, this was considered sufficient given the known alluvial cover of c. 3-6 m, and provided sufficient lateral resolution for the primary aims of this project.

Interpretation of the electrical imaging traverses. three lines of electrical imaging were undertaken. Results from three selected traverses are shown in FIG. 14, while an interpretation based on all the data is displayed in FIG. 15. Certain general conclusions can be drawn regarding the variations in resistivity across this lower terrace. The background readings suggest a general decrease in resistivity to the north, with a slight increase being apparent to the south and west. There is a noticeable decrease in resistivity in the east of the study area. However, absolute resistivity values are not especially significant, rather the relative values are of interest. Within the data there is evidence for possible sand and gravel deposits. For example, Line 7, FIG. 14. However, it is apparent that the high resistivity zone is unlikely to be the palaeochannel of interest, given its shallow depth and lack of vertical extent. Borehole evidence suggests alluvial cover of 2-6 m. It is possible that the high resistivity zones reflect better drainage in the soils overlying the sand and gravel channel. The lack of a response from the palaeochannel at depth may be due to the high watertable: there may be insufficient contrast in the deposits below the water table. Line 18, FIG. 14, shows the uniform response expected from the alluvial floodplain. It is suggested that the alluvium in this area is 2-3m thick, and there is no evidence of a channel this far north. The zones of high resistance are displayed in plan in FIG. 15. The results show a discrete band of high readings suggestive of a channel. There is some correlation with the gradiometer data, although analysis of the resistivity data suggests that the eastern arm of the meander has not been defined by the electrical imaging technique. Line 19 (FIG. 14) was undertaken with the aim of defining the probable extension of the road excavated on the upper terrace to the north-east. While a high resistivity response has been noted, interpretation is cautious, given the shallow nature of the response, and the limited amount of data collected. To the east, the</page><page sequence="41">A RIVER PORT AND EMPORION IN CENTRAL BULGARIA 349 electrical imaging results provide no evidence for a putative palaeochannel, although this may be due to changes in the levels of groundwater during the survey. It is possible that the magnetic anomalies in the east may be associated with flooding, or terraces, rather than the actual channel. CONCLUSIONS While the magnetic susceptibility and gradiometer surveys has been successful in identifying anomalies of possible archaeological interest, neither have been successful in clearly defining the limits of the site. There are several reasons for this. The data are confused by natural responses, and it has proved difficult to differentiate between potentially archaeologically significant anomalies and responses of a natural origin. More deeply buried igneous debris or pockets of magnetic gravels can produce anomalies comparable to those generated by archaeological features. By the same measure, it is also possible that some of the responses attributed a natural origin may be archaeologically significant. In addition, many structures will comprise naturally magnetic igneous material and as a result it is only from the form of anomalies that one can attempt to distinguish between stray or naturally occurring magnetic material and manmade structures. Substantial walls, floors, roads, etc. should be easily detected by gradiometry on the upper terrace, but few such responses are visible in the data. It is possible that either the site does not extend much further north than the excavations, or alternatively what did exist has been destroyed by subsequent redistribution of soil and material in recent times. On the lower terrace the location of archaeological type anomalies was always going to be difficult given the extent of alluviation, and so in this case it may simply be that the techniques are not capable of resolving archaeological features at the burial depth. However, it is unknown whether buried deposits survive below the alluvium or whether subsequent river action has obliterated this portion of the site. Attempting to map possible palaeochannels on the lower terrace has produced some interesting results. High resistivity responses, and positive magnetic anomalies, indicative of a possible palaeochannel, have been identified and broadly coincide. Viewing both data sets together gives the impression of a migrating palaeochannel, which one would expect. However, their interpretation is confused by the magnetic anomalies to the south and east. To the south there is no corroborative evidence from a second technique, although further analysis of the borehole data may limit the ambiguity of the gradiometry data. To the east, the electrical imaging results provide no evidence for a putative palaeochannel, although this may be due to changes in the levels of groundwater during the survey. It is possible that the magnetic anomalies in the east may be associated with flooding or terraces rather than the actual channel. Unfortunately it is not clear which elements relate to the palaeochannel contemporaneous with the site. Given the uncertainty of the extent and date of the possible different channels, it is unclear whether the supposed archaeological responses in the south of the area are to the east or west of the former river channel. The form of the present floodplain, with its braided channels and the dominance of coarser materials in its deposits, suggest the river channel to be unstable. This is supported by the geophysical data. Under such conditions, it is likely that, under periods of high flow, the river channel(s) would quickly change and rework former deposits. This would concur with the complexity of the results, and might explain the difficulty in identifying an unambiguous palaeochannel feature. Given the characteristics of this hydro-geomorphic system, it is more likely that there are many small fragments of several lesser palaeochannels.</page><page sequence="42">350 ZOFIA H. ARCHIBALD The use of a suite of geophysical techniques on such a site is mutually beneficial. Clearly they can help to plan/target the excavation and provide a far wider context, which may assist with the interpretation and understanding of the site. However to have geophysical investigation followed by excavation and be able to re-evaluate the geophysical data is a relatively rare and beneficial position for geophysicists to be in. RESULTS OF THE BRITISH PROJECT, 1999-2001 The renewal of geophysical prospection coincided with a Franco-Bulgarian study of the geomorphological profile of the flood terrace. Core samples taken by members of the Franco-Bulgarian team revealed the presence of archaeological deposits dating from antiquity below c. 3-6 m of alluvial burden. 69The palaeo-channel revealed by electrical resistance measurements (FIG. 15) shows that the bed of the River Maritsa was much closer to the excavated terrace, in remote times, than had previously been suspected. The channel or channels detected by this method could have been formed either in antiquity or in the medieval period,70 two phases when significant fluvial activity has been documented here and elsewhere in the region around Vetren. But preliminary study of the cores suggests that the channels were already formed when the site was in its heyday. At the present stage of investigations, it is not possible to distinguish how much erosion occurred across the site as a whole in the second to first centuries BC, when habitation effectively ceased, and what further damage was caused to the remains by renewed fluvial activity in the Medieval period. The implications are nevertheless similar; archaeological remains in the lower, flood terrace have been heavily disturbed across an unknown area, perhaps over most of the enclosed settlement. Although the southern limits of the ancient site continue to elude us, the evidence of surface finds, and of buried material, together with information provided by remote sensing, confirms that activity did extend well beyond the surviving terrace in that direction.7' Excavations in the northern and southern sectors are beginning to reveal the scope and variety of activities beyond structures either side of the main east-west road. Further statistical work on data sets, together with analysis of individual finds, will clarify activities within the subphases identified. Graffiti from the terrace as a whole reflect a close intermingling of Greek and native names.72 Similarly, the evidence from these two sectors suggests close interaction between incomers from the north Aegean coast, or elsewhere in the Aegean, and native settlers. Indeed, there is no apparent way of distinguishing different communities within this physical space. Native and imported features and objects occur side by side in all locations.

Fouache (Ecole frantaise d'Athenes) are in progress. 70 Alluvial deposits dating to the late medieval period were found above the water table, at c. i m depth under the plough soil, in a trench excavated by D. Katintarova at the foot of the excavated terrace in 1993 (see Domaradzki, 'Interim', 13 and id., 'Interim 2', for further details). Unstratified ancient material was found below this, though flooding prevented continued investigation. Pottery dated to the 2nd and Ist cc. BC was found in a deep trench in the mechanical works, on the northern boundary of the town of Septemvri, below 4 m of overburden. Earlier material lay lower still. 71 See the map in Domaradzki (n. 21), 39 fig. 3. 72 L.

With respect to the faunal remains, it is clear that the hand-recovered material from Adzhiyska Vodenitsa is almost entirely composed of the remains of domestic mammals such as sheep (Ovis), goats (Capra), cattle (Bos), and pig (Sus), with a few bones from domestic fowl (colloquially known as chicken: Gallus), dogs (Canis) and horses (Equus). In 2001, the faunal investigation began the detailed recording of material from the British excavations of I999 onwards. Since this date, some contexts have been wet-sieved through 0.5 mm mesh to enhance the recovery of small items such as charred plant remains; bones of fish, birds and small or immature mammals; and small artefacts. There is very little evidence for the exploitation of any wild species of mammal, bird or fish. Notable exceptions include two bear bones (Ursus sp.): an upper jaw in quadrat A6 and a toe bone from quadrat AI. These remains relate to a variety of past activities, not all of them concerned with diet, husbandry or economy. The remains of scarcer species such as domestic fowl, hare (Lepus) and deer (Cervus, Capreolus, and ?Dama) do not appear to be randomly distributed. Such items need to be considered in conjunction with the associated stratigraphic and artefactual evidence. Many of the astragali (a bone in the ankle) of sheep, goats, cattle and pigs have been modified, either deliberately or through use. It is possible that these were used in divination, as has been suggested for some Greek sites such as the Artemision at Ephesos.73 This is but one of many observations which indicate traditions and practices that the inhabitants of Adzhiyska Vodenitsa shared with communities of the Aegean. Some cult similarities may be the result of close interaction between Aegean Greeks and inland Thracians. But the possibility also needs to be considered that the north Aegean Greek communities may not have differed as much, in their habits and expectations, from their inland neighbours as the linguistic divide might suggest. This is an issue that needs to be investigated in a different manner from the analysis of known classes of long distance commodities, or the infrastructure of commodity transactions. Further work over the next four years will aim to resolve, or clarify, such contrasting issues. University of Liverpool ZOFIA H.
