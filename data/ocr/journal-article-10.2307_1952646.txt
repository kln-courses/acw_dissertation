<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COSMOLOGY OF ARTHUR F. BENTLEY* MYRON Q. HALE The Ohio State University "Realism" in systematic political science in this country began to emerge, in a reaction against the inadequacies of legal and institu- tional description, early in this century. David Easton,' remarking the change, cites in evi- dence Arthur F. Bentley's attempt "to fashion a tool." By midcentury, it may be said, Bentleyism is tooling the fashion. A recent commentator, deploring the current emphasis on methods and measurements, declares the new orthodoxy has left its mark on the profes- sion no less than on the world and is partially responsible for our failure to identify and solve social problems.2 Yet, for all the talk about Bentley's influence, and despite the social sig- nificance of his ideas, there has been too little study of his theory of politics.3 I propose to examine his writings as those of a "realist" and to show how his search for both "realism" and a "science of politics" may lead to a surrepti- tious sanctification of the actual. In short, in this paper I shall argue that the implications of Bentley's cosmology are conservative. Bentley's political work had an ulterior end; it was not pure curiosity. "My interest in politics," he said, "is not primary, but derived from my interest in the economic life, and ... I hope from this point of approach ultimately to gain a better understanding of the economic life than I have succeeded in gaining hither- to."4 The terms of his solution, expressed first in The Process of Government, reflected his understanding of the early twentieth-century Midwestern social and economic structure. Influenced by social Darwinism and sociological realism, and rejecting legal and judicial formal- ism, Bentley advanced what could be called * A revision of a paper presented at the Mid- west Conference of Political Scientists, April 28- 29, 1960. 1 The Political System (New York, 1953). 2 Arnold A. Rogow, "Comment on Smith and Apter, or Whatever Happened to the Great Issues," this REvIEw, Vol. 51 (September, 1957), p. 771. 3 The writer's perspective derived from a re- cently completed study, "American Conserva- tism: Conventionalism, Historicism, Functiona- lism" (Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, 1958.) 4 The Process of Government, a Study of Social Pressures (Chicago, 1908), p. 210. a "functional" theory, based upon what he later called the "transactional approach." His friend John Dewey remarked upon the profound intellectual revolution that Darwin introduced. Before Darwin, Dewey explained, species had been Aristotelian forms: "Only changes which lead to some definite or fixed outcome of form are of any account and can have any account-any logos or reason-made of them."' Darwin destroyed the rigidity and the permanence of species: "And change rather than fixity is now a measure of 'reality' or energy of being; change is omnipresent."' The philosophy of pragmatism grounded itself on mutability rather than the immutable. Horace Kallen expressed this by saying that attention shifted from the noun to the verb.7 Darwin rested his thesis on the evidence of nature. But Durkheim later argued that ideas about nature are projections of social ideas upon the outer world,8 and Ashley-Montagu has since written that Darwinism was a trans- fer of the savagely competitive economy of Victorian England to biology.9 Pragmatism has not escaped a similar attribution. Jerome Frank pointed to the early interest of another pragmatist, Charles Peirce, in legal subjects, and suggested that his attitude toward nature was an expression of his social views.'" In Arthur Bentley, a Darwinian of sorts with close intellectual ties to pragmatism, we have a striking example of the projection of a social outlook onto the cosmos, so that J. R. Kantor quite accurately characterized his system as a "socio-cosmological dialectic."" 5 John Dewey, Reconstruction in Philosophy (New York, 1950), p. 64. 6 Ibid., p. 67. 7 See his article on "Functionalism," Encyclo- paedia of the Social Sciences (Edwin R.

Perhaps Bentley's cosmology was temperamentally un- suited to the man. Sharing with conservatives their distrust of reforms,'2 he was nevertheless a reformer if not a radical. He produced an un- published manuscript on the domination of the United States by business, called "Makers, Users, and Masters in America,"''3 and in 1924 he was chairman of the Indiana state commit- tee of the LaFollette party. He was sympa- thetic to the farmers and desired their organi- zation as an interest group. Nevertheless the implications of Bentley's cosmology are con- servative. It is this underlying character, I think, rather than the persuasiveness of the system as such, that accounts for his widespread popularity in the period after World War II. The past fifteen years have seen a revival and prolifera- tion of many varieties of conservative thought. Some have subscribed to the "New Conserva- tism." Others have embraced a theology. Still others, whose commitments to science will not permit them that relief, have found that they can avoid the larger issues of our day by re- nouncing problems of substance and giving their attention solely to methods. Hence per- haps some of the vogue of statistics and game theory, a retreat from politics which has been called "the New Scholasticism.''14 Even more satisfactory for such a purpose is Bentley's cosmology. Systematized godlessness will do as well as God to justify the social order, and godlessness enjoys the prestige of science. There is, of course, one drawback: cosmologies are inherently unscientific. The operational logic to which Bentley subscribed is usually con- sidered by its sponsors, such as Percy Bridg- man'5 and John Dewey,'6 to be a tool which by its very nature excludes finalities. The philo- sophical achievement of Bentley might there- fore very accurately be said to consist of placing the fluid and provisional logic of Dewey in an absolute and closed cosmos. 12 The Process of Government, pp. 1-18. It could be argued that Bentley belonged among the anti- formalists whose influence for decades was not conservative. 13 See Ratner, in Taylor, op. cit., p. 35. 14 See Barrington Moore, Jr., Political Power and Social Theory (Cambridge, 1958), pp. 90-110. 15 The Nature of Physical Theory (New York, 1936). 16 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (New York, 1938). Bentley himself admitted that his preoc- cupation was social. He began as an economist, and indeed he considered himself an economist for most of his career. But he soon discovered that economic problems were political, and this led to The Process of Government. It is all the more interesting to speculate, therefore, on why he apparently gave so little attention to institutional economics, for this discipline also assumes that economic factors seek politi- cal expression. It may be that the implicit ac- ceptance of the inevitability of change in insti- tutional economics was what repelled him, for from the beginning he sought a closed and definitive system.'7 And it is perplexing, for instance, that he gave no attention to the equilibrium theory of Leon Walras, for Bent- ley's social philosophy was also an equilibrium theory-although he never gave it that name- and his epistemology reduced all philosphy to social philosophy. Bentley's method of analysis was influenced by sociological and anthropological writers, primarily Marx, Simmel, Durkheim, and Brooks Adams, and the result was a kind of economic and sociological realism that he called "a statement of what is." But The Process of Government can hardly be called an empirical work. Although Bentley turned to the random, everyday contemporary milieu in its socio- logical context to discover the materials of politics, in The Process of Government he only cited observed raw data suitable to his system and then announced an exclusive formula- much as Marx adduced the economic data of the hungry '40s to support a philosophy which in fact rested upon assumptions independent of the data. There are, of course, two major dif- ferences. Whereas the philosophy of Marx was historically oriented and rested on the assump- tion of change, Bentley's was ahistorical and changeless. And whereas Marx turned away from philosophy-indeed he never clearly formulated his purely philosophical views'8- and gave himself up to close empirical studies, Bentley abandoned merely factual disciplines for the study of meaning and knowledge. In his first work Bentley claimed that local data have an independent existence apart from 17 See The Process of Government, pp. 208, 465- 482 for his statements on socialism, Marx, and a class analysis of society. Bentley claims that Marx's analysis lacked validity because the class did not possess unity as the group did. 18 Engels in his Anti-Diihring undertook this task; see Frederick Engels, Herr Eugen Dihring's Revolution in Science (New York, 1939).</page><page sequence="3">THE COSMOLOGY OF ARTHUR F. BENTLEY 957 the general environment.'9 But in The Process of Government he attempted to see all social facts and values in operation, and to discover social laws. He based his analysis on "func- tional observation of full system," and con- cluded that a science of politics is possible. In 1926 appeared Relativity in Man and Society; in it he denies that local data have independent existence: their meaning always derives from their setting in an environment.20 His next two books were in the field of logic, and led to his collaboration with John Dewey in writing Knowing and the Known, which was published in 1949.21 Like Bentley's last book, Inquiry into Inquiries,22 published in 1954, it empha- sized the character of knowledge as an experi- ence which involves not only the knower but the whole context of the event. Knowledge does not occur inside the skin of the observer: it is a "transaction" between him and the outside world, or, more accurately, it is a total event which is mangled if one breaks it into parts, observer and observed. Dewey and Bentley described successive formulations of the process of knowledge: "Self-action: where things are viewed as acting under their own powers. Inter-action: where thing is balanced against thing in causal inter-connec- tion. Trans-action: where systems of description and naming are employed to deal with aspects and phases of action, without final attribution to 'elements' or other presumptively detachable or independent 'entities,' 'essences,' or 'realities,' and without isolation of presumptively detach- able 'relations' from such detachable 'ele- ments.'

On pp. 72- 74, they defined the transactional approach as "functional observation of the full system, actively necessary to inquiry at some stages, held in re- serve at other stages, frequently requiring the breaking down of older verbal impactions of naming.... Interaction is presentation of par- ticles or other objects organized as operating upon one another. Self-action is pre-scientific presenta- tion in terms of presumptively independent ac- Apparently this three-stage understanding of cognition was intended to mirror the history of science. The first view, that of innate powers of action, is attributed to the Greeks.24 The second, mechanical causation, was displayed in Newtonian physics. The third, said Bentley, is modern scientific theory, and he asserted that the transactional method was the method of Einstein. But the third method is vaguely phrased. One may conjecture that it meant something more to Bentley than to Dewey. Dewey was preoccupied with the problem-solving process, and one can say with confidence that for him the transactional approach was significant be- cause it took account of the interdependence of organism and environment-the local, recip- rocating process by which the environment presents a problem to the organism and the organism successfully modifies the environ- ment. Dewey's point of departure is the need of the organism, the incompleteness of the situ- ation in which the organism finds itself. Bent- ley's conception is the completeness of the sys- tem which fulfills itself by imposing conduct upon the organism. The system functions: whatever occurs is functional. Nothing is or can be dysfunctional for Bentley.25 In an early essay he called for a cosmology, a theory "that shows knowledge as a function not merely of symbioplasm, but of the cosmos in its aspects of the greatest symbiotic phenomena."2 That tors, souls, minds, selves, power, or forces, taken as activating events.... If we confine ourselves to the problem of the balls on a billiard table they can be profitably presented and studied interactionally. But a cultural account of the game in its full spread of social growth and hu- man adaptation is already transactional." 24 Francis Cornford, The Laws of Motion in Ancient Thought (Cambridge, 1931). 25 "Knowledge and Society," in Inquiry into Inquiries, pp. 12-24. On page 20: "Our task now is to take the Dewey theory of knowledge as arising at crises of action and broaden it out, so that it will be explicitly stated in terms of more than individual lives." Bentley does this by re- ducing the individual to a segment of "taxio- plasm," an inseparable part of a society which can be properly comprehended only within a system which embraces also the physical environment. On page 18: "The wolf fighting with the pack over the too-limited quarry is as much symbio- tactic as when previously it was running down the prey." Synbiotaxis is the total process or func- tion; it follows that the prey is symbiotactic too. 26 Ibid., p. 25.</page><page sequence="4">958 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW theory proved to be the transactional approach, and Bently called it a "floating cosmology."27 The point of Bentley's agreement with Dewey is limited to the notion of the interde- pendence of phenomena, and this Percy Bridg- man would not object to. Bridgman, however, rejected as anthropomorphic "any attempt to set up any theory applicable to the entire uni- verse,"28 and perhaps it was Bentley's meta- physical bias that prompted him later to an attack on Bridgman, whom he had once so much admired. At any rate, we have the extraor- dinary spectacle of Bentley's applauding Bridg- man for his operational logic, and attacking him for making epistemological inquiry into the foundation of that logic.29 For Bridgman, knowledge is relative to the knower. For Bent- ley, it was relative to the cosmos. At the level of social theory, the difference between Bentley and Dewey is this. Dewey kept the universe open toward the future; he believed that new goals could be set and achieved by human effort.30 For Dewey mean- ing was human aspiration. For Bentley the universe was the contemporaneous struggle which was the boiling equilibrium of a closed total social system. Meaning then, was merely a social event within this struggle. The transac- tional approach yields this cosmic view. This involves an extreme form of what has come to be called the sociology of knowledge, a view which reduces ideas to factual responses of in- terests to the environment. Bentley embraced the sociology of knowledge in The Process of Government. He said: When a man writes a book to advance some particular theory about society, he reflects in it a certain phase of the social process.... The re- flection of a phase of the social process is the same thing as the reflection of some group interest or set of group interests. His "theory" is such a reflection.3' We may ask what group interest these words reflect, and the rest of the book tells us. Society is always in a state of balance-it would be more convenient to say equilibrium- in which certain groups occupy a position of dominance.32 Now, the sociology of knowledge 27 Arthur F. Bentley, Behavior, Knowledge, Fact (Bloomington, 1935), p. 183. 28 Bridgman, The Nature of Physical Theory (Princeton, 1936), p. 183. 29 Inquiry into Inquiries, pp. 113-140. 30Dewey, Reconstruction in Philosophy. 31 P. 429. 32 Ibid., p. 215. equally disarms the critics and the defenders of the status quo, intellectually. It transforms the issue between them into a practical contest of power, and so amounts to an endorsement of the position of the present possessors of power. To be sure, it is impartial, and will accept as willingly any new regime. It renders allegiance to any de facto power. Indeed, Bent- ley's ethical neutrality was evident when he suggested that no interest was more justified in dominating than any other. This attitude, though implicit in Bentley, may be called "cynical conservatism."33 Bentley's theory of knowledge is a faithful reflection of the theory of society described in The Process of Government. The subsurface layers, "the process of social life" and "political facts," can be seen in motion, through social activity and political action, and can be dealt with as social fact. Ideas have reference to nothing other than social life; they are observ- able as social fact. Ideas are surface, not sub- surface, forms. The sole question is, what interests or factors of social life express them- selves through the ideas? Answering this ques- tion forces one to break away from the indi- vidual as the unit of explanation of thought or of society, and to point instead to the more substantial social element, the group. Thus, says Bentley, the units of society are not indi- viduals but groups. But the group, too, is not a solid unit. Bentley makes it clear that what he calls groups are processes rather than collec- tions of persons. They are ongoing activities which swirl in the social cauldron. Since activ- ities are interlaced in a moving process and one has significance in terms of others, all phases of all activities are related. A group is a cross- section of such an activity. Like any cross- section of a process, it omits motion, and thereby introduces a falsification of the data. But the process itself is not properly an isolable phenomenon. It is an activity within a con- text which produces it and gives meaning to it. The real transaction, the proper study of political science, therefore, is the entire sys- tem, according to Bentley. We may observe that it is precisely at this point that the analogy to equilibrium theory in economics, with its account of balance and redress through the whole system, leaps out. 33 I am indebted to Professor Arthur W. Mac- mahon for this epithet. He suggested that Amer- ican political scientists who since 1946 have be- come interested in responsible party government and the issues of politics should have discredited, not resuscitated, Bentley.</page><page sequence="5">THE COSMOLOGY OF ARTHUR F. BENTLEY 959 It is too much to ask us to entertain a pic- ture of all of society as a single transaction, and Bentley accordingly supplies us with tools of understanding which presumably point toward the complete picture. For purposes of description he reifies groups. He gives us the conflict groups of Simmel and Gumplowicz, but not the classes of Marx. But what under- lies the groups is, as with Marx, economic interest, rather than race as with Gumplowicz. Economic interests, the "lower-lying" activ- ity and the raw material of politics, are the substructure upon which groups are erected. Not government, but the "group adjustment process" behind the government should be the object of examination. If adjustment in society is carried on by groups beneath the political level, economic groups are the keys to the system. Economic factors are not only the determinants of political events but the cre- ators and controllers of ideas. Ideologies-but he does not use the word-are mere rational- izations of the interests of the group.34 All social behavior, indeed, is conflict behavior, meaningful only as a function of underlying economic interest. But, as Socrates demonstrated to Thrasy- machus, interest is an ambiguous term. May not a man or a group mistake its interest? An affirmative answer would destroy the cosmology: it would admit the existence of a standard of judgment outside the universe of overt behavior. Accordingly, Bentley embraces the negative. The interest of a group is its course of behavior: the activity is the group and the interest simultaneously.35 This de- prives the word interest of any explanatory value, and banishes the economic substructure from the system. We are left with the picture of 34 The Process of Government, page 241: "Each group . . . will bolster up its claim on an elab- orate structure of reasoning and assertions.... When we go down to the group statement we get down below mere reasoning to the very basis of reasons." 35 Bentley put no limitations on the validity of the transactional approach and group theory as a methodology to understand politics, since he had to his own satisfaction reduced political phe- nomena to processes in a system and groups. See The Process of Government, pp. 208-209: "When groups are adequately stated, everything is stated. When I say everything I mean every- thing. The complete description will mean the complete science, in the study of social phe- nomena, as in any other field. There will be no more room for animistic 'causes' here than there." multifold processes which can be described only in terms of the contemporaneous system of which they are a part.36 Viewed one by one, Bentley says, groups are in conflict, and some dominate others. But in terms of the whole system dominance and subordination are misleading terms. These are merely ongoing activities of groups comparable to other ongoing activities of other groups. Slaves also are a group, and carry on an ac- tivity; and this activity is their interest and in their interest.37 Indeed, the "functional obser- vation" of the "full system" comprises all the "facts" and "activities" and their development within the system. Everything is functionally related in the system. In cross-section each group occupies its natural-i.e., inevitable- position, and society is a natural-i.e., in- evitable-order, dominated by a natural-i.e,. inevitable-aristocracy.38 On this teaching, all must be for the best in this best of all possible worlds. If interest has no subjective content and can be defined only as overt behavior, it follows that "need" also is a description of what exists rather than a report of a disparity between what exists and some independent standard of reference. In his first work, a study of The Condition of the Western Farmer, Bentley suggested that the debtor needs the creditor; farmers need the bankers.39 In The Process of Government he universalizes this conception. Need is not an emptiness but an activity. The activity may include a clamor, but this clamor is merely a part of the ongoing activities which make a balanced system. It orchestrates with all the other clamors into the music of the spheres.40 It seems that Bentley is willing to pay a high price for the satisfaction of a closed system. Institutions of government, Bentley tells us, are ongoing activities which express the domi- 36 It is just at this point that many behaviora- lists begin their analysis. 37 Bentley, The Process of Government, p. 271. "No slaves, not the worst abused of all, but help to form the government. They are an interest group within it." This is hard to reconcile with his refusal to admit Marx's classes as groups. 38 Ibid., pp. 219-254. 39 Op. cit., p. 46. 40 See The Process of Government, p. 443: "All of the groups ... have value in terms of each other, just as have the colors in a painting, or sounds in music.... There is not a bit of the process that does not have its meaning in terms of other parts."</page><page sequence="6">960 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW nance of groups. But the equilibrium of the system will prevent the domination of a single group through government, he says, for the group process in government is balanced by the group process outside of government. But if interests are manifested solely through groups, and there are no interests which are not so manifested, there is no essential difference be- tween what Bentley calls the "representative- ness" of interest groups and the structural organization of government. All social phe- nomena have pressures connected with govern- ment, and government is nothing more than an organization of interests combined into a single system. Indeed, the essence of his functional theory of the state is that all inter- ests and all potential interests are a part of the governing process, since each interest is represented in proportion to its pressure.4' It follows that government also is open to no reproach for maladjustment, inefficiency, or frustration of interests. Complaints against government mean nothing more than that other groups besides the dominant ones engage in activity. Bentley also describes this phe- nomenon. Government generates opposition,42 an activity which may institutionalize itself formally. The study of government is the study of the groups pressing on one another and new groups pushing old from the various agen- cies. And Bentley undertakes to classify gov- ernmental forms in terms of the group struc- ture of society. Differences in government are not differences of principle, but rather of "techniques for the functioning of interests."43 By watching the groups that secure organized methods of access to political power and com- paring group processes, we can classify forms of government. But regardless of the form the process is always the same, for the existing political structure can only reflect groups which 41 See Relativity in Man and Society, pp. 119- 120: "The term state indicates a great complex of closely coinciding activities, which hold together, and get enough representative process for stabil- ity. The state is fundamental not as a mystic being but only in the sense of this stability, this durational extent, this relative permanence." 42 See The Process of Government, pp. 234-38. Bentley contends that a group representing sub- groups and reflecting a common economic in- terest transforms itself into a hierarchically organized aristocratic machine of government, and the group struggle follows: a natural aris- tocracy opposed by a natural demogogy. A na- tural aristocracy generates a natural demagogic group movement. 43 Ibid., p. 443. are "freely combining, dissolving, and recom- bining in accordance with their interest lines."" It is perplexing that at one point Bentley sug- gested that contemporaneously American gov- ernment was "out of adjustment," out of bal- ance with its group base.45 On his principles this is impossible. One of the most striking things about this system, as we have seen, is its contemporaneity. It does not aim at the future, it does not express the past. Of course, Bentley takes account of the past. He mentions "habit-background" and "custom," but these are assimilated to the system.46 They enter into the substantive content of present interests. Since the idea of interest has no content save activity, no mean- ing except occurrence,47 it is hospitable to anything that can be said to enter into occur- rence. But this does not give him a time-orien- ted system. The real is always here and now. All of the system lies before the observer and can be understood fully in terms of immediate contemporary observation. Time, for Bentley, is a dimension of the present.48 The relation between Bentley's theory and his method should now be apparent. Through his transactional approach, the observation of the full functioning of the system, he asserted that it was possible to grasp the inner aims and purposes of any system characterized by stability. He conceived the particular (inter- est) as an integrated and reciprocating part of this "dynamically" changing system. His methodology was based, therefore, upon the concept of equilibrium or balance. It made possible a science of politics. He concluded: 44 Ibid., p. 358. 45 Ibid., pp. 301, 358-59, 449-58. Not only did he feel that government or the American Re- public was "out of adjustment," but that we had not modeled a system of government to meet our needs, and that democracy or representative democracy was a "structural arrangement" which would prevent groups from obtaining a "dispro- portionate power of functioning through govern- ment." 46 See Inquiry into Inquiries, p. 344: "Be- havioral pasts and futures-histories and goals, habits and purposings-are before us descrip- tively in behavioral presents." 47 See The Process of Government, pp. 192-3, where Bentley said that if a comparison of group activity were made, "we shall have the human na- ture and the environment comprised in our very statement of the activities themselves-the actual happenings." 48 See Relativity in Man and Society, pp. 139, 205-6; also Inquiry into Inquiries, p. 24.</page><page sequence="7">THE COSMOLOGY OF ARTHUR F. BENTLEY 961 One might work out a picture of the adjust- ment, "normal" for the given society ... in terms of the adjustment of the actual strengths ... a process that every interest forcing itself beyond the point of endurableness to the re- mainder of the interests would be checked before its excess has provoked violent reaction.49 So Bentley's science of politics ended in a science of control within a closed system. We may suppose that a political scientist who announced, without more, that political science could dispense with history and psy- chology would win few followers. But appar- ently it is possible to contrive a system which attributes no significance to psychology and history and win converts to the system. This has only recently been true. The first edition of The Process of Government, in 1908, was rather uncharitably received and had limited influ- ence. The second, in 1935, was published by friends at a small press as a kind of reflex of interest in his more important work in logic. But in 1949 it had a third edition, and in 1955 a fourth; in 1957 a Festschrift was presented to Bentley. Formal studies have acknowledged indebtedness and sometimes professed adher- ence to his principles.50 What is the explanation of this recent popularity? 49 The Process of Government, p. 458. Paul A. Baran, a Marxist economist, attri- butes the vogue of equilibrium theory in eco- nomics to the current failure of capitalism to solve the problem of growths' equilibrium theory studies transactions in a closed system and until lately it implicitly denied the goal of growth. But the economic problem of most of the world is growth. Equilibrium theory in politics also studies transactions in a closed sytem and still assumes the sempiternity of the system. It is ironical that the current fashion should insist upon the perpetuity of group struggle and group con- flict, while the socialist sector of the world makes the point that cooperation rather than conflict may be the basis of social life, and many of the uncommitted countries seek such a solution. In a rapidly changing world, I sub- mit that the teachings of cynical conservatism are inadequate. I suggest, too, that those who are interested in developing a general theory of politics look not only for additional tools, but look also very closely at the new tools that are offered. 50 Not all "group theorists," however, have been bound by his system. I would clearly dis- tinguish between Bentley and the work of Profes- sor David Truman. 51 The Political Economy of Growth (New York, 1957).</page></plain_text>
