<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philippine Quarterly of Culture &amp; Society 27 (1999): 24-58 WARRIOR BURIALS AND THE NATURE OF WARFARE IN PREHISPANIC PHILIPPINE CHIEFDOMS Laura Lee Junker INTRODUCTION In prehispanic times, maritime raiding was one of a number of strate? gies used by Philippine chiefs and sultans to expand their social prestige, economic base, and political power (Junker 1999: 336-369; Mallari 1986; Scott 1994: 147-157, 186-188). Because of the relative abundance of pro? ductive land relative to labor in the prehispanic Philippines and in other parts of Southeast Asia, seizure of slaves (but also agricultural stores, met? al weaponry, and elite paraphernalia) rather than territories was a primary motivating factor in inter-polity raiding (Reid 1988: 121-129). Raids against rival groups enhanced chiefly status and political sway by provid? ing women for polygamous marriages, by increasing agricultural and craft productivity through enslaved labor, and by providing sacrificial victims for status-enhancing ritual feasts held by the chiefly elite. Strategic raids on rival coastal ports also gained the chiefly aggressor advantage in the foreign prestige goods trade. Coastal raids effected considerable economic hardship on trade competitors and made them less desirable trade partners, as the attacked population fled inland and port resources were destroyed. Epic stories emphasizing warrior prowess, warfare-related ritual, and war? rior status insignia reinforced the social value of raiding activities, allow? ing chiefs to raise large fighting forces through their alliance networks. In this paper, I report on the discovery in 1995 of a "warrior" burial at the fifteenth to sixteenth century coastal chiefly trading center of Tanjay in Negros Oriental. However, in interpreting the Tanjay burial remains, I Laura Lee Junker, Ph.D. is now adjunct professor with the Department of Anthropol? ogy, University of Oklahoma, 455 W. Lindsey, Norman, Oklahoma, USA 73072.</page><page sequence="2">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 25 open up a larger discussion on the role of warfare, slave-raiding, head-tak? ing, and human sacrifice in the political economy of Philippine maritime trading chiefdoms like Tanjay in the early and mid-second millennium A.D.. The 1995 excavations of settlement and burial remains at Tanjay was part of a larger, decades-long project of extensive regional archae? ological survey and excavation at selected sites in the Tanjay and Bais mu? nicipalities, conducted by myself, Karl Hutterer, and Bill Macdonald (Hutterer 1981; Hutterer and Macdonald 1982; Junker 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999; Macdonald 1982). Spanish texts indicate that Tanjay was a relatively small-scale maritime trading chiefdom in the 16th century. However, ar? chaeological evidence confirms the presence of a socio-politically complex society in the region from at least the early second millennium A.D. advent of foreign trade, if not back into the pre-porcelain Metal Age phase. Re? gional settlement data from more than 500 sites in the Tanjay River Basin, coupled with evidence from excavations at the chiefly center of Tanjay, re? veal a maritime trading polity that expanded in scale and in political and economic complexity in the two centuries just prior to European contact. The discovery in 1986 (reported in Junker 1993 in this journal) of a mass burial of nine individuals with signs of violent death and human heads as grave accompaniments in the 15th-16th century occupation level at Tanjay, raised questions about the expanding significance of warfare in chiefly political economies of this period. More recent archaeological in? vestigations at Tanjay and related sites in 1994 and 1995 have provided additional information about iron weapons manufacture, the nature of town fortifications, possible "refuge" locales in the Tanjay River Basin, and other evidence relevant to examining changes in the scale and intensity of warfare in the region (Junker 1999). Evidence for violence and head-taking in the Tanjay burials is exam? ined within the larger context of prehispanic Philippine burials dated to the Metal Age (ca. A.D. 500-1000), Early Porcelain Period (ca. A.D. 1000 1400), and Late Porcelain Period (ca. A.D. 1400 to contact). The burial data, along with other types of archaeological evidence (expanded metals production, the spread of fortifications and refuge locales, the appearance of standardized "warrior" insignia), supports historic indicators of an in? creasing scale and intensity of warfare among lowland maritime trading chiefdoms in the two centuries prior to European colonization. In my con? cluding remarks, I suggest some reasons why maritime raiding and other</page><page sequence="3">26 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY forms of warfare may have increased as a competitive strategy among Philippine chiefs of this period. A "WARRIOR BURIAL" AND MASSACRE AT 15TH-16TH CENTURY TANJAY Archaeologists have often found that the most direct archaeological evidence for the scale and intensity of violent conflict in a society comes from osteological studies of human skeletal material recovered in burials. Forensic analysis of skeletons can determine the incidence of violent death or injury (as shown in healed fractures) in a population, as well as the pres? ence of debilitating physical conditions or malnutrition that might have contributed to an individual's or population's vulnerability to attack and inability to fight or flee (Di Peso 1974; Milner 1995). Osteological evi? dence for decapitation or other types of skeletal mutilation is significant in reconstructing ritualized aspects of warfare and post-war ceremonies, in? cluding head-taking, cannibalism, and ritualized display of human "war trophies" (Redmond 1994: 102-109; Turner and Turner 1992). In the Philippines, burials are a good source of archaeological infer? ence about social and political structure, demography, disease, and vio? lence in prehispanic societies for several reasons: skeletal material is often remarkably well-preserved in the coralline-rich soils of some islands, buri? als are often placed under contemporaneously occupied houses rather than in isolated cemeteries (often allowing us to connect specific habitation and burial groups) (Junker 1993), and past excavations of cemeteries have often recovered substantial-sized burial populations in the hundreds (e.g. Fox 1959; Locsin and Locsin 1967; Peralta and Salazar 1974). Unfortu? nately, burials have been more attractive than settlement remains to antiq? uities dealers and others who loot the graves for porcelains and other marketable goods, without regard to their scientific value. The "warrior" burial reported on here was, in fact, disturbed by vandals in the course of the Tanjay Project excavations, but we carefully recorded aspects of the burial as it was excavated and we were fortunately able to reconstruct the disturbed features. In excavations at Tanjay in 1995 (Junker, Gunn, and Santos 1996), we discovered a well-preserved adult male burial (Figure 1) with evidence for violent death and accompanied by what appear to "warrior" insignia. The</page><page sequence="4">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 27 Figure 1. Sixteenth-century male warrior from Tanjay with evidence of violent death in a war or raid (iron black in ribs). (From Junker 1999: 366.)</page><page sequence="5">28 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY burial was recovered beneath habitation debris associated with a pile house, the post holes and hearth of which were located about 5 meters to the west. The individual was a young adult male with artificially filed, gold-pegged, and betel-stained teeth, consistent with the insignia of Visayan "warriors" mentioned in many sixteenth century Spanish texts (see below). The individual was buried with a Late Ming blue-on-white plate over his pelvis, a 15th century Annamese jarlet next to his left femur, at least five other porcelain vessels that were fragmented and scattered in the grave, several heavily corroded iron or bronze blades, boars' teeth, and two pigs' tusks pendants. Analysis of the dentition and cranial sutures sug? gested that the deceased male was less than 30 years old but beyond his teens, since his parietal suture was not fully fused but his third molars were wholly erupted. This age is consistent with expectations that the major fighting force in prehispanic Philippine societies consisted of young adult males in prime physical condition. The relative elaborateness of burial ac? companiments, including clear "warrior" insignia, would however be con? sistent with an experienced warrior who had the military prowess to have achieved a high status and its material trappings. The most remarkable aspect of the burial was the discovery of a nar? row iron blade still embedded in the rib cage of the individual, causing a traumatic injury that was the obvious factor in death. While the blade was heavily corroded, it appeared to be part of a dagger or narrow spearhead that was thrust laterally into the right side of the rib cage, where it dam? aged the edges of the 6th and 7th ribs. The angle of blade, the nature of the fracture damage, and perforating damage to the ribs discounted the possi? bility that the blade belonged to the warrior himself and was simply laid on his chest as a post-mortem burial accompaniment. Similar to other burials with traumatic injuries and/or "warrior" insig? nia of the same period, the grave contained at least one and possibly two detached skulls as grave accompaniments. One skull was placed on the left femur (upper leg) of the individual. The other detached skull was located just to the right of the individual's right tibia (lower leg), but it was heavily fragmented and the surrounding soil showed signs of disturbance. The lo? cation of the second detached skull and its highly fragmentary state made it difficult to determine whether it was a purposeful insertion into this bur? ial or belonged to an earlier burial that was disturbed. That at least one of the detached skulls might represent a "revenge head-taking" episode asso</page><page sequence="6">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 29 ciated with the male's death is suggested by ethnographic and historic evi? dence presented below. Historical sources, as well as archaeological evidence from contempo? raneous sites, indicate that the types of grave accompaniments found in the burial are commonly associated with male warriors. Ethnographic descrip? tions and historic accounts of warrior emblems among traditional lowland chiefdoms of the 16th through early 20th centuries emphasize tattooing or body painting, filed and gold-pegged teeth, certain clothing designs, jew? elry composed of animal parts, elaborately decorated bronze and iron weaponry, and "trophy skulls" as near-universal markers of warrior status and political sway. The significance of these standardized warrior emblems in ethnographically and historically known populations is examined below. These features of the Tanjay burial are not unique at Philippine cemeteries of the period. The recognition of status accrued in warfare clearly takes the form of standardized insignia in male burials at a number of other Philip? pine sites. A number of male burials at Calatagan, Bolinao, Santa Ana, and other early to mid-second millennium A.D. Philippine cemeteries contain filed and gold-pegged teeth and/or animal tooth necklaces, bronze and iron weaponry, and trophy heads (e.g. Fox 1959; Legaspi 1974; Locson and Locsin 1967). The "warrior" burial was discovered in the same sector of the site as a mass burial with traumatic deaths recovered in 1986 at Tanjay. In this pre? viously reported archaeological work at Tanjay, excavations adjacent to one 15th-16th century domestic structure yielded a large mass grave con? taining at least nine individuals, including several male-female pairs and a male-female-child triad (see Junker 1993). The mass grave, unlike most early to mid-second millennium A.D. burials at Tanjay and at similar coastal trading centers, yielded no manufactured burial goods, but con? tained eight detached skulls as grave accompaniments and exhibited a number of skeletal abnormalities amongst the intact individuals. One adult female had a severe cranial trauma consistent with a piercing blow to the forehead and one of the adult males had a misaligned vertebral column consistent with a severe spinal injury. At least two of the isolated crania have attached atlases, commonly cited by forensic anthropologists as evi? dence for decapitation. The 1986 burials were interpreted as the result of a devastating raid on the Tanjay community in which a significant number of people were</page><page sequence="7">30 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY killed, including multiple family members arranged in clusters in the com? mon grave. The lack of "normal11 gender- and status- associated burial ac? companiments (e.g. earthenware pottery and loom weights in female burials; metal implements and fishing net weights in male burials; Chinese porcelain, glass beads, and other imported goods in high-status burials of both sexes) in the mass burial suggested that mortuary rites recognized the exceptional circumstance of violent death. Like the latter "warrior burial", the inclusion of detached skulls may indicate that a revenge-aimed, head? hunting raid took place- shortly after the deaths and the skulls of enemies were incorporated into the mortuary rites for the slain group. THE ROLE OF WARFARE IN PHILIPPINE CHIEFLY POLITICAL ECONOMIES Contact-period Spanish accounts and early ethnographic descriptions of warfare in Philippine complex societies emphasize the significance of inter-polity raiding in the political economy of these societies and provide a framework for interpreting the archaeological finds at Tanjay. Because of rather low population densities relative to land, seizure of resources (in? cluding slaves, agricultural stores, metal weaponry, and elite parapherna? lia) rather than territorial conquest was a primary motivating factor in inter-polity warfare in many Southeast Asian societies (Junker 1999: 336 369; Reid 1988: 121-129, 1992: 461). Early European writers were often surprised to find that seemingly fierce battles often resulted in limited casualties and rarely in permanent land grabs by the victors. Almost con? tinuous raids, and even larger-scale military endeavors between polities, were generally aimed at capturing slaves to meet local labor shortages and seizing the portable wealth that was core to the political economies of Southeast Asian kingdoms and chiefdoms. In Philippine chiefdoms, continuous raiding provided a source of chiefly wealth procurement that was alternative to tribute mobilization and inter-island trade. However, inter-polity warfare and raiding had a number of more indirect impacts on the local political economies of Philippine chiefdoms. Seizure of foreign slaves augmented a chiefs productive labor force, increasing agricultural surplus and freeing up local labor for manu? facturing and trading activities. Raids against rival maritime trading ports were also an effective form of foreign trade competition, as export stores</page><page sequence="8">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 31 were seized, the attacked population fled inland, and prospective Chinese traders were diverted to less chaotic ports. Finally, foreign slaves captured in raids were also a valuable commodity as ffdestroyable wealth" that could enhance the status of their possessor: Slaves were the most common vic? tims of human sacrifice associated with chiefly ritual feasting events. Since I have written extensively on these aspects of warfare elsewhere (Junker 1999), I will only briefly review the ethnohistoric evidence here and how it might shed light on the Tanjay burials. Slave-Taking: Augmenting the Labor Force of Chiefs Expanding chiefdoms required additional surplus to support a growing number of specialist producers and foreign traders and they would be par? ticularly attracted to slave-raiding as a strategy for increasing the labor un? der their control. The Spaniard Francisco Alcina's (1688b: 161-179) lengthy account of Visayan warfare suggests that the taking of foreign cap? tives to be integrated into local social networks and economy was an ex? plicit goal of inter-polity raiding at the time of European contact (also see Reid 1983: 22 and Warren 1985: 222-228). Economist Henry Schwaken? berg (1993) has effectively argued that slave-raiding was a successful eco? nomic strategy to redistribute labor in the prehispanic Philippines, due to significant variability in the productivity of agricultural land, uneven popu? lation distributions, and labor intensive farming techniques. An ideology of prestige associated with valor in warfare and prowess in slave-raiding (see below) reinforced "labor capture" as an attractive choice for augment? ing the labor force under a chiefs control. Larger labor forces, in turn, in? creased overall agricultural productivity, supported an expanding military force for continued slave-raiding, allowed chiefs to devote more of their labor to maritime trading activities, and generally expanded the politically manipulable surplus under a chiefs control. Slave-raiding and debt-bondage appear to have been most prevalent in those regions of Southeast Asia with multiple rather than single power cen? ters, and in periods of greater political fragmentation and inter-polity eco? nomic competition (Reid 1983: 18). We would expect an increase in the intensity and scale of slave-raiding in the Philippines in the 15th-16th cen? turies, when historical and archaeological evidence point to the rise of multiple rival power centers attempting to simultaneously expand their po</page><page sequence="9">32 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY litical influence and economic base. The increased agricultural production and heightened participation in foreign trade that came from assimilation of slaves into the local economy was undoubtedly a major factor in the ex? panding scale and complexity of Philippine polities like Sulu and Magin danao at this time (Warren 1985: 222-228; also see Kiefer 1972 and Majul 1973). If the significant value of labor in the archipelago promoted a war? fare strategy emphasizing slave-taking rather than large-scale slaughter of rivals, then mass killings like the Tanjay multiple burial must have been relatively rare events that occasioned special recognition in mortuary rit? ual. As discussed in more detail below, historical accounts indicate that warfare-related deaths often precipitated a further round of revenge killing or head-taking. Ironically, the high value of labor as an economically limit? ing good generally discouraged wasteful human slaughter in warfare, but on occasions when prestige issues were involved (e.g. avenging the death of a prominent warrior, attempts to surpass the status of rivals through a spectacularly provisioned ritual feast), human sacrifices made the strongest possible statement about social value and political power. Maritime Pirac y and Foreign Trade Early Chinese accounts indicate that maritime piracy and coastal raid? ing were long-established strategies for wealth acquisition in the Philippine archipelago. A 13th century Chinese text provides a vivid description of the "Pi-ye-sha" ("painted or tattooed ones") maritime raiders, probably Visayans from the central Philippines, who created fear along the western littoral of the Philippines in the early first millennium A.D., seizing slaves and booty from coastal settlements (Chen 1966: 271; Craig 1914: 4; Laufer 1907: 253-255; Scott 1984: 74-75). The Pi-ye-sha are even named as possible culprits in a series of 13th century attacks on Cham settlements and other coastal centers of the Southeast Asian mainland. Later Spanish accounts indicate that, in fact, many coastal populations in the contact period Philippines found that maritime piracy and the seizure of the luxury commodities from ships passing through the archipelago was a more attractive alternative than formal trade to gain access to wealth ob? jects (Artieda 1569: 197-198; Quirino and Garcia 1958; Chirino 1604: 305-308; Colin 1660: 176, 179; Lavezaris 1569: 287; Loarca 1582a: 117; Morga 1609b: 292; Pigafetta 1521: 68-70; also see Baumgartner 1977 and</page><page sequence="10">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 33 Mallari 1986). The most favored time for large-scale raiding expeditions was immediately after the completion of harvest activities, when a large contingent of personnel was available to participate and maximum damage to an adjacent community's food supply and other resources could be in? flicted (e.g. de Rada 1577; Morga 1609a: 87). From the ethnohistoric accounts, it is clear that the economic disrup? tion suffered by the defeated not only included the loss or destruction of resources and labor forces critical to effective participation in foreign trade, but also frequent physical displacement of the coastal elites to inte? rior refuges, and at least temporary cessation of foreign trading activities by wary Chinese merchants (e.g. Alcina 1688b: 161; Cole 1913: 183; Qui rante 1624: 155). Anthony Reid suggests that the limited investment in elaborate architecture and the high portability of "wealth" (e.g. slaves, met? al, porcelains, silks) in Southeast Asian coastal centers made flight a more attractive alternative than construction of large-scale fortifications and a stubborn defense (Reid 1988: 122; also see Mallari 1986). It would often be weeks or even months before an attacked coastal settlement's popula? tion could return to their homes and resume agricultural production, mari? time trading, and other activities vital to chiefly political economies. Reid (1992: 461) notes that Southeast Asian maritime raiding "was not particu? larly costly of lives on the battlefield, but it was enormously disruptive of the domestic and agricultural pattern." It is likely that foreign trade ships would studiously avoid ports known to be frequently attacked or trading partners who could not offer sufficient export goods or subsistence support for traders in transit. Many historically-known Southeast Asian maritime trading polities protected their sea lanes by establishing special relationships with ethni? cally-distinct seafaring populations who could either escort a foreign ship or plunder it on the ruler's command. For example, the Srivijaya polity used the Orang Laut, a traditional seafaring group living on the islands and coasts of eastern Sumatra, as mercenaries to protect trade ships they did business with and to practice piracy against others (Andaya and Andaya 1982: 25; Wolters 1967: 187). In the Philippines, specialist seafarers like the Iranun or Ilanun developed similar client relations with the expanding Sulu and Magindanao maritime trading polities by at least the 17th century (Hall 1968: 339; Mednick 1977: 209-228; Warren 1985: 149-171; see also Tarling 1963). The constant raids of the 18th and early 19th centuries</page><page sequence="11">34 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY wreaked havoc on the local economies of their target populations. In the area around the then Spanish town of Manila, fishermen were in fear of pursuing their livelihood, agricultural shortages were common, and for? eign traders had to take circuitous routes to the port as a result of these pi? ratical expeditions by the Iranun (Warren 1985: 168). Thus, frequent raiding of rival coastal trade ports, as well as the sea? borne piracy of ships associated with trade competitors, were aggressive strategies whereby Philippine polities sought to establish maritime trade monopolies. Chiefs periodically raised large warrior forces through their extensive alliance networks to protect their ports and ships, as well as to at? tack rival ports and the ships of competitors. An ideology of warrior pres? tige, materialized in warrior insignia (see below), appears to have been significant in attracting followers to these chief-sponsored raiding groups. Head-taking and Human Sacrifice If the relatively high value of labor in island Southeast Asia tends to discourage large-scale human slaughter in warfare, then the widespread practice of using human captives in sacrificial rites (Reid 1983; Andaya and Ishii 1992: 509) seems like a contradiction. However, ethnohistoric analyses of ritual sacrifice in Southeast Asian societies suggest that it is precisely the great "value" of sacrificial offerings (e.g. water buffalo, do? mestic pig, and rare marine delicacies, as well as people) that confers status on the ritual sponsor. Contact period Spanish sources suggest that head-taking, human sacrifice, and the use of enemy body parts as war "tro? phies" were tied to status displays in post-war feasts and elite mortuary rit? ual among the Tagalog-speaking lowland societies of Luzon (e.g. Quirino and Garcia 1958: 383; Plasencia in Sanchez 1991: 484; Morga 1609a: 75). Plasencia (1592, in Sanchez 1991: 484) wrote that, amongst the Tagalogs, "when some chief dies, to avenge his death they had to cut off many heads, with which they would make many feasts and dances." Head-taking, in association with what may be termed as "revenge raids" in a cycle of inter-district conflict, is of course ethnographically most well-known among the interior northern Luzon cordillera groups such as the Ilongot, Kalinga and Apayao (e.g. Barton 1949: 154-155, 231 243; Dozier 1966: 55-56, 116-117, 198-235; Rosaldo 1980). Dozier (1966: 200) notes that among the Kalinga the severed heads are used in numerous</page><page sequence="12">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 35 ways as ritual objects in post-raid ceremonies and as permanent status-con? ferring "trophies" for the raid participants. Keesing's detailed ethnohistoric research for lowland areas of northern Luzon suggests that not only was head-taking a historically prevalent feature of warfare in societies of the region (1962: 42, 164-165, 180, 183, 189-190, 297), but also that captured heads were essential to post-war ritual aimed at augmenting the supernatu? ral power of warriors. Enemy skulls commonly functioned as ritual drink? ing cups, as prestige items to be displayed at status-conferring feasts, and in some cases as "heirlooms" (similar to imported porcelains) to be passed on to the next generation (Keesing 1962: 64, 74, 136, 153). Several 17th and 18th century documents on the Apayao of northwestern Cagayan make explicit reference to the subsequent burial of captured heads along with prestige goods and ritual food offerings as grave accompaniments for a prominent individual. Head-taking and skull burial were viewed as essen? tial ritual means of ending the proscribed period of mourning, even in the case of a non-violent death (Keesing 1962: 189, 199; see also Scott 1984: 192). Relating revenge raids and head-taking more directly to social status and mortuary feasts, Cole (1913: 105) notes that the period of mourning for a Bagobo datu (chief) or other high-ranking individual, whether they were the victims of violence or not, could only be terminated by a ritual human sacrifice involving captured "enemies" or slaves. A lower ranking Bagobo could also gain some measure of status, while fulfilling his obliga? tion to a deceased relative, by "purchasing a piece" of the victim or victims sacrificed yearly at the GinEm ceremony. Particularly important deceased individuals, such as a paramount datu or powerful magani (warrior), rated a special revenge raid specifically aimed at procuring a sacrificial victim for the mortuary feast. Most significantly for archaeological recognition of this practice, Cole (1913: 115) writes that, before disposing of the sacrifi? cial victim, "any person who wishes may cut off a portion of the flesh or hair and carry it to the grave of some relative whom he may have reason to believe is being troubled by evil spirits." In light of the historical and ethnographic evidence, the decapitated crania in both the mass burial and the single "warrior" burial at Tanjay are likely the heads of "enemies" taken either in revenge raids for specific vio? lent deaths, or simply opportunistically as sacrificial victims for status-en? hancing ritual feasts. Such grave accompaniments may have been a</page><page sequence="13">36 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY necessary part of mortuary rites for those dying violently or simply as em? blems of warrior prestige, functioning similar to metal weapons and animal bone pendants to mark the status of a chief or prominent warrior (see be? low). The demand for sacrificial victims, as well as agricultural laborers, may have fueled the predatory tendencies of some of the most successful Philippine slave-raiders, particularly in periods of greater political frag? mentation and intensified status competition. Ideology of Warrior Prestige and Warrior Emblems Early Spanish accounts suggest that warriors who had undertaken a great number of raids and returned with substantial booty and captives, were rewarded with social rank and status insignia that were just below that of the datu ("chiefly") class (e.g. Alcina 1688b: 14; Quirino and Gar? cia 1958: 383; Legaspi 1572: 124; Morga 1609a: 75). The vast majority of Visayan myths or epic tales collected by Alcina (e.g. Alcina 1688a: 20-23, 77-78; 1688b: 165-169, 277-278) had warrior-heroes as their central fig? ures. Similarly, Mindanao epic tales recorded by ethnographers and histo? rians (e.g. Manuel 1958; Scott 1994: 166-169) are peopled by warrior-chiefs ornamented in the status insignia of their rank who conquer neighboring populations, foreigners, or later Europeans, through a combi? nation of daring and magical power. Alcina (1688b: 177-179) notes that these epics, sometimes related in song, are often repeated prior to raiding expeditions to inflame the passions of the warriors and inspire them to fight valiantly. These epic tales and songs recount the exploits of warriors who could perform supernatural feats, such as catching and killing wild boars or crocodiles with their bare hands, lifting large stones or trees to crush enemies, or running so swiftly that no footprints are left for avenging enemies to follow. Alcina (1688a: 20-37), Chirino (1604), and the Boxer Codex of 1590 (Quirino and Garcia 1958) all suggest that epic stories were not written in Philippine scripts, but were orally presented in pre-war ritu? als and on other ceremonial occasions. Early Spanish accounts indicate that prominent warriors were allowed to wear a turban-style cloth headdress (cendal in Visayan, potong in Taga log) formed by wrapping a narrow cloth around the temples and forehead (Alcina 1688b: 148-160; Colin 1660: 161). The color of the cloth (blood red for the most valiant warriors) and the elaborateness of the embroidered</page><page sequence="14">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 37 borders which fell on the shoulders, indicated the relative status of the war? rior in terms of the numbers of people he had slain and captured (Colin 1660: 161). Males in most lowland complex societies of the Philippines, but especially in the Visayas, acquired tattoos throughout their adult life? time according to their performance in raiding activities (e.g. Colin 1660: 163; Rodriguez 1565: 126; Artieda 1659: 200; Sande 1576: 225). As sum? marized by Colin (1660: 163): The whole body was not tattooed at one time, but it was done gradually. In olden times no tattooing was begun until some brave deed had been performed; and af? ter that, for each one of the parts of the body which was tattooed some new deed had to be performed. Later ethnographic accounts of the Bagobo, Magindanao, Maranao, and Manobo of Mindanao also emphasize that blood-red trousers, tunics and head-scarves were reserved for high-ranking warriors of either the "elite" or "commoner" class who had distinguished themselves in warfare and raiding (Casals et al 1982: 137; Cole 1913: 96, 155; see also Saleeby 1905 and Mednick 1977). As described by Cole (1913: 96) for the Bagobo: The chief aim in life of the man is to have the right to wear the blood-red cloth? ing and to be known as magani. As stated earlier, this term is applied to a man who has killed two or more persons. He is then entitled to wear the peculiar chocolate-colored head covering. When his score has reached four he can don blood-red trousers, and when he has six lives to his credit he is permitted to wear the complete blood-red suit and to carry a bag of the same color. Unfortunately, like the feather work and tattoos of Polynesian warrior elite, these perishable status insignia related to military prowess were es? sentially archaeologically "invisible." However, Loarca (1582b: 281) reports that Visayan warriors often wore pendants or "charms" manufactured out of crocodile teeth or wild boar's teeth that were part of pre-war ritual activities: These natives have a method of casting lots with the teeth of a crocodile or of a wild boar. During the ceremony they invoke their gods and their ancestors, and inquire of them as to the result of their wars and their journeys. By knots or loops which they make with cords, they foretell what will happen to them.</page><page sequence="15">38 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Sixteenth century Spanish sources also report that especially renowned warriors (even those of inherited "commoner" or "slave" rank) marked their status through filed and gold-pegged teeth, gold ornamentation, and elaborately-decored metal weaponry (with carved antler handles some? times incised and inlaid with gold or semi-precious stones) which were prominently displayed in their waistbands (e.g. Pigafetta 1521a: 46, 50-51, 58, 64; Quirino and Garcia 1958: 424-426, 397-398; Rodriguez 1565: 126). Elaborately decorated metal weapons, padded armor and bamboo breastplates, and talismans like boar's teeth, were not only a sign of war? rior status, but were viewed as possessing magical properties that could shield the wearer from harm when worn into battle. The 16th century male burial recovered at Tanjay in 1995, containing metal weaponry, boars' teeth pendants, and filed and gold-pegged teeth, conforms to these descriptions of "warrior" emblems reported in early Spanish texts and later ethnographic accounts of militaristic Philippine chiefdoms in the northern, central and southern Philippines. The fact that these burial accompaniments are found with a relatively young adult male showing evidence of a violent death and one or more de? tached skulls as additional grave goods (an aspect of the burial to be ad? dressed in the next section), supports an interpretation of this burial pattern as symbolic of the deceased individual's status as a warrior. More than 43 additional burials, dated from 12th to 16th centuries, have been recovered from beneath house structures or in the vicinity of habitation debris within the settlement of Tanjay since the excavations were begun in 1981. Two other male burials were accompanied by fragments of what appear to be metal weaponry, but no other burials (male or female) have been recovered in which the individual has filed or gold-pegged teeth, animal tooth jew? elry, or other historically known warrior insignia. The relative rarity of this type of mortuary pattern, and its association with some but not all males, strengthens the inference that it represents a warfare-related status marker. As noted above, male burials with filed and gold-pegged teeth and accom? panied by metal artifacts have been reported by Philippine archaeologists at other burial sites (e.g. Santa Ana, Calatagan, and Bolinao), and they are particularly prevalent in the 15th and early 16th centuries. William Henry Scott's etymological analysis of some terms associated with warfare is consistent with the archaeological evidence in suggesting that a formally recognized "warrior-elite" class, segregated by special em</page><page sequence="16">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 39 blems and linguistic designations, probably emerged in some Philippine complex societies in the few centuries just prior to European contact (Scott 1980: 152-153; 1994: 223). For example, the 16th century Tagalog term maharlika, which appears to designate a group of high-status warriors (Plasencia 1589: 173-176; San Buenaventura 1613), is almost certainly a 16th century Malay version of a Sanskrit word borrowed through contacts with Borneo or Java less than a century before European colonization. This is not to say that warrior status was not materially marked or otherwise culturally recognized prior to the mid-second millennium A.D. I merely suggest that, by the 15th-16th centuries, the scale and intensity of inter polity conflict in the archipelago may have expanded to the point where a chiefs military success depended on his ability to maintain the cohesive ness and loyalty of large fighting groups through both ideological and ma? terial means. Warrior-hero epics, warfare-related pageantry, linguistic designations that set warrior units apart from others, and "warrior" insignia such as tat? tooing and gold-pegged teeth undoubtedly reinforced the association be? tween performance in warfare and social prestige amongst male participants. However, shared war ritual and mythology and warrior titles and emblems also served to bind warriors to their chiefly patrons, who sponsored the ritual and controlled the flow of status markers. The Spanish writer Francisco Alcina (1688b: 173-174) suggests that chiefs launching large military expeditions against other polities called on their extensive al? liance and clientage networks to raise a fighting force, networks that were maintained through continual gifts of plundered wealth and warrior em? blems: There might be many ships, for as we have said Dumaraug [a chief of Albay province in southwestern Luzon] took a hundred when he went to plunder Bingi, or there might be only a few. All went under command although they might be from other towns for their friends were accustomed to offer their services, when they went on great campaigns and to far away lands, to the datu or chief who was master of the operation and had been the promoter of it... For great [raiding] ex? peditions they used to come and gather together a great number of vessels. They joined in kinship relationships whose connections endure even now, recognizing themselves as such and acknowledging them with gifts and presents according to their custom. Ethnohistoric work on the Tausug and Bagobo similarly suggest that large</page><page sequence="17">40 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY fighting forces were raised very quickly by regionally-powerful paramount chiefs through these vertically and horizontally ramifying ties of clientage and alliance (Cole 1913: 94-95; Kiefer 1972: 83-85). Shared pre-war and post-war ceremonialism, the distribution of valuable arms by the sponsor? ing chiefs, and emblematic warrior paraphernalia reinforced the "social value" of warrior prowess and solidified these fighting units. VIOLENT DEATH AND HEAD-TAKING AT PREHISPANIC PHILIPPINE CEMETERIES To put the forensic evidence for violence at Tanjay into context, it is important to look at a larger number of cemeteries excavated by archaeolo? gists in the Philippines and for which we have some statistics on the inci? dence of traumatic deaths, head-taking, and other recognizable skeletal features associated with warfare. A significant issue is whether the rela? tively large number of traumatic deaths in the Tanjay cemetery are an anomaly or relatively typical for 15th century and 16th century lowland chiefdoms. Perhaps even more significant is the question of whether war? fare and violence increase over time, as Philippine chiefdoms expand in scale, escalate their inter-polity competition for foreign trade, and increas? ingly vie for war captives as sacrificial victims in ceremonial rites. There is a relatively large sample of excavated jar-burial cemeteries in the Philippines dated to what is likely the initial period of complex society development, known as the "Metal Age" (ca. 500 B.C-A.D. 1000) (e.g. Dizon 1979, 1996; Fox 1970; Fox and Evangelista 1957; Kurjack and Sheldon 1970; Maceda 1967; Solheim 1964; Tenazas 1974). While some of the burials are cremations (and therefore provide little forensic evi? dence), there is a substantial sample of primary burials or secondary bun? dle burials at many of these sites. Yet, not a single burial from this period yielded osteological evidence for violent death, and there are no recorded instances of mass burials (see Figure 2). The number of professionally ex? cavated early second millennium A.D. cemeteries is considerably smaller (e.g. Fox and Legaspi 1977; Junker 1993; Locsin and Locsin 1967), al? though the burial sample sizes at individual cemeteries are relatively large (more than 200 at the llth-14th century Santa Ana cemetery). However, there are no reported instances of skeletal traumas or other signs of violent</page><page sequence="18"></page><page sequence="19">42 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY death, although a few of the Santa Ana burials with 14th century Early Ming porcelains had isolated detached skulls as burial accompaniments. In contrast, a significant number of the burials recovered from 15th 16th century cemeteries such as Calatagan (Fox 1959), Calubcub Segundo (Salcedo 1979), Bolinao (Legaspi 1974), and Tanjay (Junker 1993; Junker, Gunn and Santos 1996) have unequivocal signs of violence, including de? capitation, skeletal traumas, or impaling by metal weapons (Figure 2). Of the total of 505 burials recovered from the 15th century Pulung Bakaw and Kay Tomas cemeteries at Calatagan, Fox reports that 19 (or 3.7 percent) are skeletal remains with missing crania. Of these nineteen, which include both sexes and juveniles as well as adults, four exhibit clear signs of de? capitation. In one case the missing crania is laid at the feet of the skeleton, while in another case a large brain coral was substituted for the missing head. Unlike the 15th-16th century Tanjay burials with evidence for vio? lence, there are no unusual grave furniture or differences in burial treat? ment to mark violent deaths in the cemetery. Some headless burials contained porcelains, decorated earthenware, and/or spindle whorls, while others had no associated grave furnishings (Fox 1959: 348). At the roughly contemporaneous cemetery of Calubcub Segundo in Batangas, Salcedo (1979) reports that several of the sixteen primary burials consist of isolated crania which lack the earthenware vessels, foreign porcelains, glass beads, and gold fragments accompanying other burials at the site. Salcedo (1979) suggests that these individuals might represent the victims of head-taking in revenge raids who, being outsiders to the community, may have been treated differently in burial rites. Approximately 23 percent of the burials thus far recovered from 15th 16th century deposits at the site of Tanjay have osteological evidence for, or are inferred from archaeological context to have suffered, a violent death. Interestingly, all the burials with evidence for violent death and what are likely "trophy heads" are found in the "non-elite" sector of the settlement. This is consistent with what we know ethnographically about warfare in chiefdom-level societies: While elites generally organized and led local warriors into battle, they were often protected from violence or capture by superior weaponry and armor, by the presence of personal bodyguards, and by the construction of additional defensive works around their residences (e.g. the earthen fortifications around the Tausug datus' house-compounds reported by Spoehr 1973).</page><page sequence="20">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 43 While excavations of contemporaneous cemeteries like the Calatagan and Calubcub Segundo burial sites in Batangas yielded a much smaller percentage of violent deaths than Tanjay, it may be significant that mortu? ary evidence for conflict and head-taking appears almost exclusively in the 15th-16th centuries. The appearance of a highly standardized set of "war? rior" emblems in these mid-second millennium A.D. cemeteries may also mark the emergence of a specialized "warrior" class in the centuries before European contact, as suggested by linguistic analysis and historic accounts. HISTORIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR EXPANDING WARFARE AND RAIDING IN 15TH-16TH CENTURY PHILIPPINE CHIEFDOMS Given the mortuary evidence for an increasing incidence of violent deaths in the 15th and 16th centuries, are there other archaeological indica? tions and historically-recorded trends that point to an expansion of raiding and warfare in Philippine maritime trading chiefdoms in the two centuries just prior to European contact? Historical analysis, as well as archaeologi? cal evidence regarding metals production and the construction of defensive fortifications, do suggest that the scale and intensity of inter-polity raiding expanded in the two centuries just prior to European contact. The 15th and 16th centuries are a time when we see increasing competition between emerging large-scale, maritime trade-oriented paramount chieftaincies at Manila, Cebu, Jolo (the Sulu polity), Cotabato (the Magindanao polity), and other areas of the Philippine archipelago (Junker 1999; Scott 1994). As emphasized in the introductory section of this paper, militarism was one of a number of forms of competitive interaction through which these historically-known Philippine polities attempted to gain political suprem? acy and economic ascendancy over neighboring chiefdoms. While mari? time raiding v/as a wealth-generating pursuit in itself, warfare was also intimately linked to other strategies of material acquisition such as foreign prestige goods trade and competitive feasting (Junker 1999). Early Chinese accounts of Philippine coastal maritime trading polities indicate that inter-polity raiding was prevalent enough in the archipelago in the early second millennium A.D. to warrant caution by foreign trading vessels. Earlier in the chapter, we mentioned Chau Ju-kua's 14th century commentary on Chinese problems with the Pi-ye-sha raiders of the Central</page><page sequence="21">44 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Philippines (Scott 1984: 74-75). However, several ethnohistoric-based ob? servations suggest that inter-polity conflict may have intensified in the Philippines in the 15th-16th centuries. While there are scattered Chinese references to maritime raiding activities in the early part of the second mil? lennium, many Chinese accounts from this period make no mention what? soever of piracy and seaborne raiding (despite the fact that piracy would have been a major economic concern to Chinese traders). In contrast, early 16th century Spanish accounts emphasize the pervasiveness and constancy of inter-polity conflict at the time of initial contact, often providing vivid descriptions of large-scale warfare and almost ceaseless maritime raiding between chiefly centers (e.g. Alcina 1688b: 161-179; Artieda 1569: 197 198; Chirino 1604: 305-308; Colin 1660: 176, 179; Lavezaris 1569: 287; Legaspi 1567: 55; Legaspi 1569: 38; Loarca 1582a: 151; Morga 1609a: 82; Pigafetta 1521: 68-70). In addition, descriptions of fortifications and other large-scale defen? sive works are noticeably absent from 14th century and earlier Chinese ac? counts of Philippine coastal trading centers, and in several instances it is implied that the chiefly residences and storehouses were readily visible from sea approaches (e.g. Scott 1984: 74-75). Filipino chiefs who were wary of foreign ships are described as disappearing inland, rather than tak? ing refuge inside fortified coastal towns (Chen 1966: 271; Craig 1914: 4; Laufer 1907: 253-255). In contrast, the initial Spanish explorers noted the near-universality of wooden stockade and ditch fortification (or occasion? ally earthen embankments or stone walls) surrounding the major coastal trading ports such as Cebu, Manila, Tondo, Cotabato (Lower Valley Magindanao polity), and Jolo (Sulu polity). In addition, many of these na? tive fortresses were defended by relatively sophisticated large-scale artil? lery, Chinese-inspired but locally-manufactured iron and bronze cannons and swivel-guns, that were clearly recently-adopted technologies not re? ported in pre-15th century Chinese accounts (e.g. Anon. 1570, in Blair and Robertson 1903, Vol. 3: 102-103, 144, 148, 160; Artieda 1569: 200-201; Sande 1577: 106). However, it should be noted that Chinese and Spanish conceptions of the scale and frequency of militarism in Philippine chiefdoms were colored by the specific historical context of their contacts. Chinese traders inter? acted primarily with the larger Philippine polities, whose rulers usually had a vested interest in safeguarding the maritime passage of their Chinese</page><page sequence="22">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 45 trade partners and insulating them from internal conflict (although occa? sional piracy against foreign ships certainly occurred). In contrast, Span? iards intent on military conquest and suppression of local rebellion were intensely interested in accurately assessing military strengths and defensive technologies. Fortunately, archaeological investigations can be brought to bear on this issue of intensifying inter-polity conflict. A number of archaeologists have specifically addressed the methodo? logical issue of how to recognize behavioral and ideological aspects of warfare in the archaeological record (e.g. Carneiro 1990; Redmond 1994; Milner 1995; Vend 1984; Webster 1975). Archaeological studies of the growth of defensive works or fortifications provide important evidence for the relative intensity and scale of chiefly warfare in different cultural phases. Significantly, all of the Philippine settlement sites with archae? ological remains of fortifications are dated to the 12th century and later, in? cluding portions of a 15th-16th century ditch-and-stockade at Tanjay in the central Philippines (Junker 1999), hilltop citadels with stone walls on the island of Batanes in the northern Philippines that may date back to the 12th century (Dizon and Santiago 1994), and earthen, coral-block, and wooden fortifications around the residences of 18th and 19th centuries Sulu chiefs in the southern Philippines (Spoehr 1973: 88-102). At Tanjay, where occu? pation is archaeologically documented back into the first millennium A.D., defensive works do not appear until around the 15th century, in the form of large, closely-spaced post holes and a 2-3 meter wide ditch running along the coastal approach to the settlement. Fortification is associated with Tan jay's emergence as a coastal maritime trading center with significantly greater access to foreign porcelain trade. Unfortunately, archaeological in? vestigations at chiefly centers such as Cebu (Hutterer 1973; Nishimura 1992) and Manila (Fox and Legaspi 1977; Peralta and Salazar 1974), with similarly lengthy occupation phases, have been constrained by modem land use. We have no evidence which would allow us to determine when the large-scale defensive works observed by the Spanish were initially constructed at these sites. On a regional scale, expansionists inter-polity warfare in complex so? cieties may be manifested more subtly in shifting "boundaries" between polities as one expands and another contracts, evidenced in abrupt stylistic changes in pottery styles, architectural forms and other material indicators of ethnic or group identity (Peebles and Kus 1977: 431-432; Renfrew</page><page sequence="23">46 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY 1982: 3-4). Intense inter-polity warfare may also be evidenced in a notice? able fall-off in the archaeological evidence for settlement along polity boundaries (e.g. Anderson 1994: 39-41; Cordy 1981: 172-200), or in the appearance of the types of interior "refuge" locales noted above. Redmond (1994: 83) suggests that the realignment of regional and interregional alli? ances accompanying large-scale warfare may be evident in changes in the intensity and geographic sphere of prestige goods exchanges. We might actually see an upsurge in prestige goods exchange with greater inter-pol? ity conflict. Limited regional settlement evidence and few systematic studies of lo? cal ceramic "styles" leaves us with a poor archaeological database for documenting the long-term expansion and contraction of many Philippine polities. However, for the Tanjay polity, regional settlement data suggests an expanding geographic reach of interior exchange networks, attempts to consolidate political control of interior river routes, and the establishment of upriver centers that may have played a critical role in coastal defense in the 15th-16th centuries. Metal goods and fancy earthenware produced at the polity center, as well as exotic porcelains entering the coastal trade port, penetrate much further into the Tanjay Region interior and are found in significantly higher densities in the 15th-16th centuries compared to ear? lier periods. These geographically expanding artifact distributions suggest that the political alliance networks of Tanjay chiefs were growing through exchange and/or militarism. The strategic location of the interior riverbank centers in defensible terrace-side positions suggest their dual functions as economic interfaces with interior populations and "asylum" locales for be? sieged coastal chiefs, who may have been in conflict with rival maritime trading polities at this time. In Southeast Asia, the development of bronze and particularly iron metallurgy has been linked to military expansion of political power (Higham 1989; Reid 1988: 106-114). While some of the metalwork in the Philippines was ornamental, ritually-related, or geared towards the produc? tion of agricultural implements (e.g. iron reaping tools and plows), most of the historically reported metal goods were weapons (Alcina 1688b: 148 160; Anonymous 1572: 95, 98-100, 107; Lavezaris 1573: 138; Sande 1576: 225; also see Dizon 1983, 1987 and Scott 1994: 147-148). There? fore, increases in metal goods and features associated with metal produc</page><page sequence="24">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 47 tion at Philippine settlements are likely to reflect expanding emphasis on warfare technologies. At Cebu, archaeological evidence for iron production comes from late in the occupation sequence (after the 14th century), and includes iron slag, iron fragments, and carved antler fragments (probably used as dagger hafts) (Hutterer 1973; Nishimura 1992). Nishimura (1992) reports that iron and bronze densities increase dramatically in late 15th century-early 16th century deposits at Cebu, and that production and use of metal expands over a much larger area of the site. At Tanjay, we see a similarly dramatic increase in the 15th-16th centuries in the densities of iron and bronze frag? ments in the settlement (see Figure 9.2 in Junker 1999), as well as evi? dence for indigenous metallurgy. If we assume that much of the iron metallurgy is devoted to weapons manufacture, increased iron production may be related to intensified conflict between the Cebu and Tanjay polities and rival chiefdoms in the vicinity of these centers. Ethnohistoric sources suggest that Philippine chiefs also used their ad? vantageous positions in foreign trade to gain access to military technolo? gies from outside the archipelago. At Tanjay, all of the bronze blade fragments in habitation deposits and burials were almost certainly im? ported and the bulk of the bronze is dated to the 15th-16th centuries. Tan? jay chiefs may have begun to import bronze weaponry from China or elsewhere in Southeast Asia as part of their expanding foreign trade. Not surprisingly, Spoehr's (1973: 88-102) excavations of Sulu chiefs' 18th and 19th century fortified house-compounds recovered prodigious amounts of European firearm parts and ordinance in the household middens. The Sulu chiefs competed to obtain European weapons technology through trade well before the sultanate finally succumbed to colonial rule (Warren 1985). CONCLUSION Both historic and archaeological evidence suggest an association be? tween intensified maritime raiding and the political and economic expan? sion of Philippine chiefdoms. The emergence of larger-scale maritime trading chiefdoms in some areas of the Philippines in the 15th-16th centu? ries coincides with increasing use of coastal defensive fortifications, as well as interior centers that might have functioned as "refuges" rather than home fortifications. In addition, we see an increasing number of violent</page><page sequence="25">48 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY deaths and decapitations recorded in cemeteries of the period, including a particularly high percentage of such burials at the chiefly center of Tanjay. I have also suggested that the expanding metal production archaeologists have noted in 15th and 16th century occupation phases at Cebu and Tanjay may relate to the increasing importance of metal weaponry for both strate? gic military purposes and as warrior status emblems in the period. Compe? tition between Philippine chiefs to control superior technologies for warfare is also indicated by the adoption of foreign military technologies, such as Chinese cannons and Japanese bronze swords and armor, at the growing political centers of Manila, Cotabato, and Jolo. Early contact period accounts of Philippine chiefdoms suggest some reasons why inter-polity warfare in the archipelago may have expanded in scale and intensity in the 15th and 16th centuries. While Philippine chiefs competed for control of foreign prestige goods trade through many non militaristic strategies, such as formalized tributary missions to the Chinese court and development of superior port facilities, raiding against trade ri? vals was clearly an effective means of capturing a greater share of foreign commerce. In addition, as chiefs became increasingly involved in maritime trade and specialized export-producing activities, labor shortages for basic subsistence production may have been increasingly met through slave raiding and labor capture. Historic and ethnographic sources indicate that some raiding was also aimed at procuring sacrificial victims for ritual feasts which greatly enhanced the reputation and political sway of chiefs who sponsored them. Returning to the Tanjay "warrior" burial and similar burials at other 15th-16th cemeteries, their significance lies in the considerable stand? ardization of mortuary treatment that appears to be lacking in preceding periods. The appearance of standardized emblems in selected male burials may mark the emergence of specialized warrior classes in some Philippine chiefdoms of the period. Warfare and raiding activities - aimed at protect? ing foreign trade routes, capturing slave labor, and obtaining status-en? hancing sacrificial victims - may have become of such a scale and frequency in many of these chiefdoms that male subordinates of chiefs were solidified into more permanent fighting units. In contact period Phil? ippine chiefdoms, emblems of warrior status (e.g. tattooing, certain cloth? ing and armor, tooth filing and gold-pegging), along with orally-recounted epics glorifying military successes and shared pre-war and post-war ritual,</page><page sequence="26">PREHISPANIC WARRIOR BURIALS 49 were important material and ideological means for maintaining and ex? panding these warrior forces. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The 1995 archaeological fieldwork at Tanjay, Negros Oriental that re? sulted in the discovery of the "warrior burial" was sponsored by the Na? tional Geographic Society in Washington, D.C. I am grateful to Mayor Arturo Regalado and other municipal authorities in Tanjay who allowed my research team to carry out this important work at the site, in the middle of their bustling town. As always, I am also indebted to Eusebio Dizon, Wilfredo Ronquillo, Amalia de la Torre, and a host of other personnel at the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila for facilitating my ar? chaeological fieldwork at Tanjay. Mary Gunn, Mary Joy Santos, Angel Bautista, Arne Garong, Clyde Jago-on, Eusebio Dizon, Joven Mirasol, and others too numerous to name participated in the 1995 archaeological exca? vations at Tanjay and contributed greatly to the report and interpretations presented here.
