<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iron Horses: Leland Stanford, Eadweard Muybridge, and the Industrialised Eye John Ott Produced under the sponsorship of Leland Stanford, one-time Governor of California and President of the Central Pacific Railroad, at his large ranch in Palo Alto, Eadweard Muybridge's pioneering images of horses frozen mid-stride have today become little more than unusual relics on the dusty top shelf of photographic and cinematic history. Muybridge's serial instantaneous photographs are largely familiar to us from flip-books, or perhaps the occasional exhibit of a zoetrope in a museum of science or natural history. Hitherto, there has been little substantive analysis of the cultural significance of the production and appreciation of these images in their own right. Instead, scholars mine this historical record largely to determine the exact time, place, and circumstance of cinema's birth.1 Neglected curios like the Muybridge compendium demand to be reexamined in the context of a broader cultural history. Neither the Muybridge photographs nor their means of their production were inevitable. A major pitfall of film history has been to treat its technologies as a closed system, sealed off from society and progressing inexorably towards the present day. But as Gilles Deleuze has succinctly put it, 'machines are social before being technical'.2 In this spirit, this study investigates instead the cultural work these images accomplished, from their conceptualisation to their creation to their reception. In particular, I wish to scrutinise these photographic stills in the context of the nation's complex and troubled process of mechanisation during the late nineteenth century. In short, I contend that Leland Stanford and his advocates publicly staged and disseminated these photographs in order to consolidate, promote, and naturalise the developments of industrial capitalism. As I hope to demonstrate, this gilding of the new order was as important to capitalist entrepreneurs like Stanford as the proper flow of labour and capital. I do not find it coincidental, then, that the owner and manager of locomotives was interested in the mechanics of animal locomotion. For supporters and critics alike, this photographic archive and the transcontinental railroad were indelibly co-implicated in ways beyond their mutual execution under Stanford's supervision. To begin with, Stanford proffered these experiments as evidence of his commitment to the public good, as clear benefits for both the economy in general and the art community in particular, and as exemplars of a new industrial order. For sympathisers, the stop-action photographs epitomised the inevitability and supremacy of the industrial, mechanised, and capitalised technologies in the saga of national progress. Many considered the strange images captured on glass almost sublime in their revelations of technotopian promise. Through the Muybridge experiments, Stanford strove to convince the world that horseflesh and the iron horse behaved in remarkably similar ways. In like fashion he also insisted that the mechanical gaze of the 1. The ensuing stream of scholarly publications has preoccupied itself with bringing new evidence to bear on what has become a messy and contentious paternity suit. Terry Ramsaye, for example, in his two-volume film history A Million and One Nights, helped to set the pattern by denigrating Muybridge and attacking his character with unusual vehemence; subsequent film historians have noted that Ramsaye's vitriol for Muybridge dovetails with the author's slavish adulation of Thomas Edison, who by Ramsaye's account deserves full and sole credit for inventing cinema. Terry Ramsaye, A Million and One Nights (Simon and Schuster: New York, 1964 [19261); Ramsaye is critiqued by Harlan Hamilton, '"Les Allures du Cheval": Eadweard James Muybridge's Contribution to the Motion Picture', Film Comment, vol. 5, no. 3, Fall 1969, pp. 17-31. Contrawise, photographic historians have unduly inflated Muybridge's role, in part to legitimate the photographic medium as a high art form. Neither Muybridge nor Stanford should be deified as the creator of motion pictures. To begin with, a number of now- forgotten devices - stroboscopes, kinetoscopes, projecting phenakistoscopes, and other gewgaws - served as important transitions between still, printed images and projected, moving ones. See Robert Taft, Photography and the American Scene (Dover Publications: New York, 1938), p. 408; and Charles Musser, The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907 (Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan: New York, 1990), p. 45. A few academics, such as Steve Neale, have observed this teleological character within Muybridge scholarship. Yet even those who have outlined the shortcomings of evaluating these images as mere precursors to film still feel obliged to contrast Muybridge's entertaining 'fictions' with the purportedly more legitimately scientific endeavours of Marey. Barbara Braun, for example, spends quite a bit of her book on Marey proving Muybridge a ridiculous figure. See Steve Neale, Cinema and Technology: Image, Sound, Color (Indiana University Press: Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1985), p. 7; and Marta Braun, Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904) (The University of Chicago Press: Chicago and London, 1992), esp. pp. 228-62.

At the same time, many contemporaries responded to these photographs by questioning the role and nature of technology, industrialism, and individuals like Leland Stanford, who had amassed substantial fortunes and power through mechanisation and the corporation. Many deemed the vision of instantaneity not wondrous but a kind of gothic horror. In addition, antagonists often rejected both their highly touted social utility and Stanford's proclaimed munificence. However, because these were photographs, the debate that I examine here centred on distinct modes and philosophies of visual production and consumption. The Muybridge archive, and responses thereto, thus marked an important moment when two rival conceptions of viewership collided. At stake, ultimately, was the ability to lay claim to social authority through the very practice of representation. The Experiments: Stills of Motion Some time in the spring of 1872, Stanford solicited Muybridge to produce a still photo of a horse in full trot.3 The industrialist hoped to prove his theory of unsupported transit, which hypothesised that all four hooves of a trotter left the ground entirely for a split second over the course of its gait. On 7 April 1873, the Alta California reported that Muybridge had successfully captured an image of a moving horse at a remarkable one five-hundredth of a second. Unfortunately, these inaugural images have not survived in the form of photographs; but that year Currier and Ives published a print of 'the California Wonder Occident', and widely disseminated it commercially. Limited by the inconclusive results of a slower shutter speed, the lithographer clung to equestrian conventions that would be gradually abandoned in the years to come: crooked fore- and hindmost legs, an unnatural symmetry of the limbs, a silhouette nearly parallel to the ground line, and an almost comical height off the ground. All these details, of course, best expressed Stanford's theory of unsupported transit. In July 1877, Stanford transferred the photographic laboratory to the new stock farm in Palo Alto, and in the following month much wider newspaper coverage reported that the shutter speed had been reduced to one-thousandth of a second.4 Muybridge's 'Automatic Electro-Photograph' (Fig. 1) reveals that the application of electricity to the shutter mechanism had enabled the photographer to reduce the exposure time enough to publish his own print. Stanford also instigated the next phase of the experiments - the serial photographs for which Muybridge would be best known.5 Inside a large shed set flush against the racecourse, Muybridge laterally arrayed twelve cameras 21 inches apart (Fig. 2). Carriage-bearing horses activated each camera by means of wires laid along the ground, while unencumbered mounts likewise tripped a series of breast-high threads strung before each of the lenses. On 15 June 1878, Stanford staged an exhibition in Palo Alto and asked reporters in attendance to observe the entire process of the photographs' manufacture, from the speeding mounts' activation of the cameras to Muybridge's immediate, on site development of the negatives. That year, Muybridge printed and sold six resulting sets of exposures, with each group of six, eight, or twelve images arrayed in serial comic-strip fashion (Fig. 3). In the wake of widespread acclaim, Muybridge initiated addresses the archive only as supporting evidence for the peculiar modernity of canonical painters: Thomas Eakins in the case of Michael Leja, Edouard Manet in the case of Jonathan Crary. See Michael Leja, 'Eakins and Icons', Art Bulletin, vol. 83, no. 3, September 2001, pp. 479-97; and Jonathan Crary, Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle, and Modern Culture (MIT Press: Cambridge and London, 1999), esp. pp. 138-48. Likewise, Rebecca Solnit's recent, ambitious study, Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West (Penguin: New York, 2003), promises to situate these stills in their historic moment only, in the end, to figure them teleologically as augurs of technological developments in the Far West: 'Muybridge's motion studies are like an early life-form from which wildly divergent species descend' (p. 211). 2.

The relentless insistence on veracity - at public exhibitions and lectures, in newspaper reports, and on mass-produced lithographs - demonstrates, I think, just how strange and unconventional these images must have appeared to contemporaries. Especially disconcerting was the discovery that steeds in full gallop did not fully extend their limbs 'hobby-horse' fashion, as had been depicted since the earliest renderings of horses.8 Muybridge would not reintegrate his sequential pictures into projected images that simulated motion until the autumn of 1879, at a private screening at the Stanford home often dubbed the first 'home movies'.9 Within a year, Muybridge unveiled his 'zoopraxiscope' and its specially prepared glass discs, transparent save for the parade of horses rimming the perimeter in proper locomotive sequence. When set in motion before a projecting magic lantern, the shadows thrown from the discs produced a convincing illusion of motion. 'Nothing was wanting', wrote the San Francisco Bulletin, 'but the clatter of the hoofs from the turf and an occasional breath of steam from the nostrils'.10 A California Geld Rush The tremendous scope of attention and acclaim visited upon the Muybridge- Stanford project was owed to its very subject matter. The Gilded Age - or 'gelded age', by the estimation of transportation historian Clay McShane - marked the apogee of the horse in America. Calvary played an unprecedented role in the Civil War, while during the postbellum period, the population and exploitation of horses in America grew apace with more commonly accepted measures of industrialisation, such as the nation's total mileage of rail-lines. Accordingly, writes McShane, 'in the mid-nineteenth century, the horse was featured as a symbol of prosperity and modernity ... in business advertisements'.11 Americans' dependence on equines is perhaps best dramatised by the destructive Great Epizootic of 8.

First and foremost, equines evoked tradition and the aristocracy of the ancien regime. Whether riding a lavish coach in Central or Golden Gate Park, or breeding and competing racehorses, entrepreneurial elites articulated their class identity and prestige through the ownership of costly horses, carriages, and stables.'3 This period also witnessed the development of breed sensibilities. As one of the most renowned and successful breeders in the world, Leland Stanford no doubt accumulated social prestige and the patina of elite traditions through his equestrian expertise. While Jane and Leland Stanford would eventually open a university in 1893 on the site of the stock farm Leland playfully called his 'kindergarten track', horses occupied the president of the Central Pacific Railroad in the 1870s.'4 In this spirit, contemporary artists adapted the Euro-American tradition of aristocratic and military equestrian portraits to canvases depicting the new moneyed elites. In San Francisco, for example, merchants and bankers commissioned works in which horses acted as primary signifiers of high social status. Thomas Hill's undated William Ralston Driving Double features the owner of the Bank of California holding the reins of two of his nearly 100 horses and racing his carriage from San Francisco to his suburban 15- estate at Belmont.15 Horse ownership, however, also provided social critics with evidence of the indulgences of plutocrats like Ralston. 'When a San Franciscan gets to be immensely wealthy', opined the San Francisco Argonaut in 1877, 'he builds a palace of a stable with marble halls, Brussels carpet, and hot and cold water in every stall; a Chicago millionaire builds a college'. 16 The Watchmaker And yet, according to Stanford and his associates, the success and significance of these photographs was due to the subjection of horses to a spectrum of mechanical apparati. The collaborators consistently emphasised the means by which these photographs had been achieved even more than the subject matter itself. At every stage of the images' production, Stanford and his carefully chosen representatives framed, staged, and promoted these experiments as the product of a rational, positivist science. They repeatedly insisted that this project drew from the latest scientific research; that Stanford and Muybridge carried it out as an experiment verifiable through observable, quantifiable phenomena; that machines gathered the data (active voice); that Stanford applied its findings in a purportedly scientific fashion to the training of trotters; and that a medical doctor published the results in technical language in a scientific context. To begin with, Stanford's claims of scientific rigour papered over less favourable associations with an idle, decadent, and horse-bound aristocracy. Stanford attributed his success in breeding swift trotters to his implementation of scientific principles. His celebrated 'Palo Alto system' conditioned trotters far earlier than most stables, and took care not to overexert his trainees. At the centre of the track the railroad executive sat in a custom-made rotating chair from which he could observe the work of his ranch hands and the progress of the colts.'7 12.

The very set-up of the camera shed and complex recording instruments recall the forum of a research laboratory, a milieu that grew to maturity in the industrial sector in the 1870s and 1880s.'8 Stanford also conscripted technicians from the Central Pacific to assist Muybridge.19 Moreover, when it came time to publish the results of the decade-long series of experiments, Stanford turned not to the photographer Muybridge, but to a local scientific authority, Dr J. D. B. Stillman. Stillman packed his 1882 book The Horse in Motion with an exhaustive analysis of the Muybridge photographs dense with technical language and medical jargon.2 Stanford's attraction to and application of photography was especially crucial in this regard. In fact, Muybridge and his employer did not so much discover unsupported transit as document it in figural form. By 1872, the French scientist Etienne-Jules Marey had already substantiated the theory of unsupported transit through experiments involving pneumatic sensors attached to each hoof of a trotting horse.21 The railroad executive pursued not Marey's abstract, graphical means of gathering and reporting data but the revelatory possibilities of the sensitised glass plate. Still more importantly, however, the Muybridge photos encouraged viewers to imagine the horse, and by extension, all of nature, as merely another kind of machine. Fixed within a cold, monotonous grid of six, twelve, or twenty-four, the serial prints demanded that viewers reconceptualise a sweaty, snorting, quivering mass of horseflesh as a dynamo performing an endlessly repetitive sequence of actions. The text on the reverse of these prints featured a detailed, methodical, and technical frame-by-frame analysis of equine mechanics. The effect on zoopraxiscope-goers, obliged to experience the same 12 frames again and again, must have been even more pronounced. It was as if the mechanical means of gathering and reporting data had been transposed somehow onto the subject of study.2 This vision of equine automatons also lies at the heart of Stillman's The Horse in Motion. The author's intricate physiological analysis depends on the premise that 'the horse is considered as a machine', a hypothesis to which Stanford likewise subscribed.23 It should come as no surprise, then, that Stillman's book also referenced social evolutionist Herbert Spencer's First Principles (1862), a work that provided a suitably mechanistic model of nature and society.24 Many commentators endorsed this proposition. An 1878 article in the Alta California, for example, observed that, in the Muybridge stills, 'the feet strike the ground with the regularity and sequence of the stamps of a quartz mill'.25 And if hippology was bona fide science, then Stanford was its leading practitioner - a role the railroad president relished enacting. 'When I began breeding horses', he proclaimed in 1891, 'I commenced studying the anatomy of the horse, until at the end I could take the steed apart and put it together with the accuracy that distinguishes a skilled watchmaker who deals with the mechanism of a timepiece'.26 Whether cognisant or not, Stanford had appropriated the popular Enlightenment trope of the divine watchmaker and placed himself in the role of the creator. By his peculiar logic, Stanford demonstrated his almost supernatural apprehension of the laws of nature through the Muybridge photographs. By his own account, the ex-Governor's interest in the minutiae of various paces developed out of the desire to standardise and optimise the 18.

When Muybridge and the other engineers could not initially synchronise the animals and the arsenal of cameras, the railroad executive complained that 'the horse would not keep correct time'.28 By offering an archetypal horse, the Muybridge catalogue wrangled equine behaviour into a logical, predictable model. The photographic endeavour began with a lamed or lazy horse and ended with Stillman's contention that 'the horse in motion is as perfectly harmonious in the display of his forces as a steam hammer' .29 Many commentators found this development encouraging. 'These pictures', declared the Call in 1879, may lead to a better selection in breeding, fostering those who show the best points, and eliminating the feebler, thus enabling science to come to the aid of Nature, and provide for the "survival of the fittest". 30 Neither God nor Nature, but science and industry, now wound the intricate watch of creation. Even those unsettled by this world view found it difficult to conceptualise Stanford's vision of nature differently. One Nation contributor lamented how 'most of us have well-nigh forgotten that the horse was an animal like ourselves ... we have come to think of him as a machine'. However, despite these objections over the inhumane treatment of animals - and especially the position that horses were mere cogs in the burgeoning American economy - the writer cannot help but conceive of them as of 'wheels in our great social machine'.31 By and large, the Muybridge photographs staged a coup for a highly controversial public figure like Stanford. While boosters and critics hotly debated the impact of the Central Pacific railroad on both the economy and average Californians, the American press largely accepted the research at the stock farm as positively beneficial for human society. The Nation argued that 'to Governor Leland Stanford, of California, belongs the credit of initiating this new method of scientific research, and of thus offering additional proof that a princely employment of wealth may be looked for in republics as well as monarchies'. Painter Ernest Meissonier even included these stills in Stanford's 1881 portrait (Fig. 4). In public statements, Stanford himself often hitched his passion for horses to the welfare and evolution of the nation. 'There is', he averred in the pages of the California Spirit of the Times, "a great economic question involved in the breeding of good horses for labor". And in an 1891 interview with Hubert Howe Bancroft, Stanford informed the historian that 'I do not raise horses ... for profit, but only to increase the wealth of the state'.34 Stanford seemed quite interested in demonstrating to the public how responsibly he supervised his tremendous fortune. Altogether, he regularly characterised large outlays such as the Muybridge project as selfless and as disinterested as the cold gaze of the battery of track-side cameras. All told, this belief system naturalised developments in mechanisation like the railroad - the iron horse. For Stanford, industrialisation was synonymous with progress; some years later, the railroad baron proffered this technotopia in his keynote remarks at the opening ceremony for the university he and Jane would endow on the site of the hippodrome in Palo Alto: 'The wonderful improvements in inventions and machinery in the last fifty years, by multiplying the power of production, have assisted greatly in the advancement of civilisation'. Thus these experiments did not just prove that horses acted like bundles of gears, levers, and engines; rather, for Equity, can be found in the Stanford Family Scrapbook (Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University, Stanford, California), vol. 3, p. 2. 27. See, for example, 'A California Discovery', Alta California, 8 July 1878, p. 1. Historical convention proposes that the impulse for Stanford's commission evolved out of an ongoing debate among turfing enthusiasts as to the exact nature of equestrian locomotion. The prevailing scholarship has fixated on the historically unverified rumour that the railroad executive contracted with Muybridge in order to settle a bet with East Coast turfmen. This suspect anecdote effectively trivialises a costly series of experiments that spanned a decade. By his own estimation, Stanford spent a total of $43,000 on the project; see Hubert Howe Bancroft, 'Biography of Leland Stanford' (Typescript, MSS C-D 807, Bancroft Library, University of California at Berkeley), Box 1, Folder 10, p. 20. 28.

The locomotive and quartz-mill, after all, were more effective machines than horses and humans. Train the Eye And yet, the ramifications of the Muybridge collaboration extended the reach of mechanisation yet further, into the realm of perception. In essence, Stanford's patronage and dissemination of these stills celebrated a new kind of automated seeing.36 Whereas the photograph differed from the human retina only in degree, the instantaneous snapshot represented a different kind of perception. In the book The Horse in Motion, Dr Stillman turned to positivist accounts in order to assuage sceptics' reluctance to accept the veracity of Muybridge's photographs and to account for millennia of inexact equine representations. By his reasoning, the scientific theory of the retinal afterimage explained why people saw galloping horses in the 'hobby-horse' position; the human eye could only register a horse's limbs at their point of greatest extension, when, like a pendulum, they moved most slowly.37 Muybridge's lectures likewise counterpoised the apparent deceptiveness of the naked eye with the unassailable fidelity of the Automatic Electro- Photograph. His presentations dwelt at length on comparisons between the 'correct' postures of animals in transit, as revealed by his photos, and the now-laughable depictions of the same in Western art. He dispelled such untruths as a kind of medieval superstition that had wilted in the strong sun of modern science. Accordingly, the horses in Rosa Bonheur's famed grand tableaux of 1853, The Horse Fair (Fig. 5), had become as fanciful, in the words of one observer, as unicorns.38 Authority passed from the European masters to an immigrant photographer and his railroad executive employer. Furthermore, the very format of the 1878 sequential frames may have fostered the notion that Muybridge's work greatly surpassed the unaided eye.

However, instead of the dual images of the stereocard, Muybridge's latticework of six, eight, or twelve stills produced a kaleidoscopic effect. It was as though a stereoscope had divided and multiplied, cell-like, into a composition that approximated sext-, oct-, or dodecan-ocular vision. All told, homo sapiens's modest set of twinned retinas paled in comparison to the Argus of the automated gaze. Thus, the worth of these strange, machined visions of animal locomotion came directly at the expense of - indeed, because of - the threshold of human perception. A few years later Century magazine would characterise the Palo Alto experiments 'an important addition to the instruments of scientific research, by extending observation along a path where the limits of human sense had barred advance'.39 As if to underline this point, in lectures, Muybridge often exhibited his San Francisco panoramas - which also showcased an extra-retinal species of representation - along with his stop-action, chrono-ramic images of horses. Nor was this transformation limited to optics. At this time, the anthropomorphic view of the cosmos was being reevaluated and edited by a number of theories that reflected, contributed to, and naturalised the ongoing process of industrialisation: in biology and sociology, the writings of Darwin and Spencer portrayed a universe that was coldly calculating in its mechanisms; economic models replaced production-based lifeways timed to cycles of nature with the new calculus of invisible but predictable market forces; and in geology, the discovery of post-Biblical or 'deep' time likewise eroded a human-centred worldview.41 Advocates thus alleged that the supremacy of mechanisation evolved from the very act of seeing. More importantly, Stanford and his supporters mobilised this new Muybridgean optics to valorise the ongoing process of rapid industrialisation and incorporation. Watching from the centre of the kindergarten track, Stanford expressed his executive prestige in terms of surveillance.42 In like fashion, both the track-side camera shed and the resulting serial photographs effectively reproduced Stanford's point-of-view by substituting a bank of 12 or 24 mechanical lenses for the ranch owner's uncanny eye. These instantaneous views are indelibly those of a manager. The transformation of mechanised vision into a kind of industrial gaze, however, was not confined to the literal aggrandisement of Stanford and his endeavours. In fact, the developments of the railroad and the stop- motion photograph did not run on parallel tracks, but intersected in important and fundamental ways. Both rail travel and the Palo Alto experiments established a kind of non-anthropomorphic time beyond the capacities of human perception. As a new experience of 'panoramic travel', to borrow a term from Wolfgang Schivelbusch, journey by rail transformed the experience of landscape and challenged the Cartesian model of time and space.43 Among other things, the moving locomotive revealed the limitations of retinal vision. The view out of the moving train window and the images flickering from the zoopraxiscope were two sides of the same coin. It is not coincidental, then, that contemporaries often paired the completion of the railroad with the execution of the Muybridge stills. Even now, the image of Stanford hammering home the final, golden spike at Promontory, Utah, emblematises the arduous task of spanning the 39.

So ingrained was this symbolism that many contemporaries, when faced with the Muybridge photographs, felt compelled to return to this primal scene of the new industrial order. I quote at length this commentary from the San Francisco Call: When Governor Stanford drove the last spike which connected the Union and Central Pacific Railroads, and, in a figurative sense united the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ... the blow of the hammer was echoed by a salvo of artillery from the shores of the bay. The act itself was the herald which announced the completion of the great design; and, surely, if it could thus be drove [sic] across mountains and valleys, the same agency [of electricity] could solve this portion of the problem [of instantaneous photography].44 Here the author collapses Stanford's symbolic act, the telegraphic transmission of the news of the railroad's completion, and the achievement of stop-motion photography. It was not just that Stanford had been present to supervise the completion of the railroad and the photographs, nor merely that he had been the inspiration for both, but that he had somehow willed both into existence with one decisive action. This mythology, of course, elided the contributions of the many workers (including Muybridge) that laboured both at the stock farm and for the railroad. To summarise, this nascent ideology of a mechanised universe legitimated the authority of science and naturalised industrial acceleration and expansion. The utility of the Muybridge photographs stems from their efficacy not merely as an argument for the superiority of an industrial gaze, but as its embodiment and exemplar. Over objections that artists should adhere to the conventions of ocular vision - a controversy on which I will shortly dwell at some length - Stillman retorted that the naked eye must become habituated to the new industrial optics.45 By this rhetoric, Americans were expected to follow the leadership of Stanford and other technocrats and submit even the way they looked at the world to their expertise. A significant portion of the national press, even beyond sympathetic venues like the Call and Scientific American, readily acceded to this stunning proposition. 'It is very probable', allowed the Nation, 'that the study of instantaneous photographs will gradually train the eye', just as Stanford had trained champion colts, and just as he had once envisioned the possibility of a transcontinental train.46 Seeing the Octopus Not everyone desired such tutelage. Many contemporaries partially or flatly contested or rejected the logic of the industrial gaze. Yet without exception, scholars express petulant impatience with the photographs' detractors, and scoff in retrospect at the recalcitrance of literally short-sighted luddites. In actuality, much public opinion was slow to conclude, divided, and rather sophisticated in its dissent. At first, the debate centred on the veracity of the published stills - hence Stanford and Muybridge's chronic need to verify the experiments through public exhibitions and gild them with the patina of scientific authority. After careful examination of the 1877 print (Fig. 1), one writer for the San Francisco Post accused the coachman of participating in a clumsy hoax. 'Decidedly [Mr Tennant] you were not driving Occident at the rate of 30 feet per second when you sat for that photo. You have been retouched by [the artist], and he has not improved on the camera'.

T. Barnum had once exhibited as a living relic from the Pleistocene era. But as the 1870s waned, the majority of criticisms increasingly touched on the larger question of the relative merits of mechanisation, which suggests that more was at stake than the proper method of representing an animal in transit. These individuals rejected the argument that nature operated like a machine bsy countering that mechanisation was unnatural and even life-threatening.4 A macabre spectre of violence and death haunts period responses to stop-action photographs. A contributor to Anthony's Photographic Bulletin did not contest the veracity of Muybridge's work, but rather maintained that the images' means of production enacted a kind of brutality upon the subjects of study. The writer reacted in horror to a horse 'seen in a series of grotesque positions, seeming at one time endeavouring to draw himself legs and body into a heap, and at others as if attempting to sling himself apart'.49 In this spirit, illustrators caricatured the Muybridge serials by exaggerating this apparent violence towards the horse to comic effect (Fig. 6); in a parody published in The Wasp, an unusually sedate driver looks on as the boneless marionette at the end of his reins gesticulates wildly. The clamour over Muybridge's findings thus constituted a deep anxiety over mechanisation and the extent to which it seemed to govern everyday life. In 1887 the Century wrote '[There is] no one who had ridden a horse or loved a dog but felt a certain outraged sensibility in being assured that creatures ... were four-legged machines' .50 This anxiety was perhaps most pronounced in popular attitudes toward the railroad, which, as we have seen, was never truly absent from any discussion involving Stanford's many projects. Even before Promontory, intellectuals like Henry George accurately warned that the completion of the transcontinental railroad would agglomerate power in the hands of a very few like never before.

Soon, cartoons in the Wasp, such as 'Machinery Monopolizes Labor', incarnated heavy industry as the sinister hybrid of biology and technology (Fig. 7).51 In order to delineate further the extent of many Americans' ambivalence towards the technologies of incorporation, I cite a parallel example that also concerns time, the mechanisation of nature, the railroad, and its critics.

Many spoke out against standard time as privilege for the few; one Boston minister even charged that the standard time was a 'piece of monopolistic work adverse to the workingman's interest' 53 While the experience of rail had already begun to disrupt the connections between time and nature, the introduction of four standard time zones on 18 November 1883 subsumed solar time to the new industrial regime.s4 In the same fashion, the Muybridge photographs standardised a sort of a physiological time, so to speak, by which the actions of animals and humans could be clocked and against which they could be measured.5s After his own fashion, Leland Stanford concurred with those who insisted that the sundial yield to the schedule of the railroad manager; recall how the railroad executive complained that 'the horse would not keep correct time'.56 Like the consolidation of the complex patchwork of local times into homogenous railroad time, the Muybridge experiments collapsed the universe of equestrian movement into a single, rational, and 'monopolist' model of equine locomotion. However, like the reaction against railroad time - many localities held out until federal law mandated standard time in 1918 - many contemporaries continued to discredit the Muybridge photographs, this time on a more philosophical level. Action Painting One final category of dissent questioned not the accuracy of Muybridge's images, but their utility for society, especially the arts. This change in the tack of criticism more effectively clamoured against the experiments not on their own empiricist terms, but rather by formulating an alternative philosophy of spectatorship and representation. Here the domain of art became the chief battleground. From the outset, we can observe a clear defensiveness on the part of Muybridge and his coterie. Since the history of painting best embodied the traditional means of depicting the movement of horses, Muybridge took special pains to set himself in opposition to then-canonical masterpieces like Bonheur's The Horse Fair (Fig. 5). Supporters also shored up the authority of science at the expense of artists. 'Our drawings', wrote Scientific American, 'lack that element of indisputable accuracy that belongs to the sun pictures. However truthful, an artist's work cannot have the convincing force of a photograph.'57 Other commentators, however, clung to the visual authority of the arts and frowned at Stillman's demand that people re-train their eyes. Despite whatever shortcomings of the retina, these partisans maintained, individuals simply did not see like a machine and artists should accordingly favour ocular truth over any revelations of the mechanical gaze.ss Another review of Stillman's tome in the pages of Century by George Waring also raised this 'question as to whether an artist whose purpose is to represent things as they seem is justified in adapting his methods to the limitations of human vision, or whether he should show things exactly as they are, and appeal only to human reason'.

Renowned for both his commitment to realism and his meticulous equestrian studies, Meissonier was well positioned to benefit from the findings at Stanford's ranch.60 The French painter himself had conducted complex and extensive experiments to ascertain the details of equine locomotion. At one point he even developed an unusual sofa that rolled on rails alongside a moving horse so that he could observe its gaits in detail. Contemporaries extolled the apparent speed and accuracy of Meissonier's eye when lauding historic military masterworks like Friedland, 1807 (1875; Fig. 8). The conventional story of Meissonier's conversion to the industrial gaze is a favourite of Stanford hagiographers. By this account, the artist was probably introduced to Muybridge's material through the December 1878 issue of La Nature, but was not initially receptive.61 In June 1881, the railroad executive came to the painter's studio with hopes of securing a portrait commission in exchange for the information contained in the pages of Muybridge's 1881 volume. After a protracted argument, Meissonier finally broke down in tears. '"How", said he, "All these years my eyes had [sic] deceived me?" "The machine cannot lie"; answered Governor Stanford'.62 By dramatising the contrasts between the pathetic figure of the sobbing European painter with the cool-headed American industrialist, this anecdote girds the authority of Stanford through the mechanised gaze. Likewise, the portrait of Stanford that emerged from his fateful appointment with Meissonier (Fig. 4) partly establishes its sitter's persona through the book of serial photographic stills that rest at the right edge of the canvas and at the convergence of the strong lines of the wooden cane and the crook of his left arm. Meissonier depicts Stanford as a man of wisdom and foresight, literally supported at the elbow by the opened Muybridge text. Another Fig. 8.

And yet, scholars have overstated the influence and authority of the Muybridge stills in this instance. It is true, of course, that Meissonier hosted a lecture by Muybridge in his Paris home that November, during the course of which the photographer also, and perhaps ungraciously, delineated the errors of his sponsor's technique. It is also a fact that Muybridge often contrasted the accuracy of Meissonier's 1814 - The Campaign of France (1864), which the painter had modified sometime after meeting Stanford, with Bonheur's 'flawed' paintings.64 On the whole, however, Meissonier only entertained the utility of the Muybridge photos for a short period of time. When Meissonier set out to alter the legs of the lead horse in 1807, he produced an image influenced by, but not in total accordance with the Muybridge stills. As art historian Marc Gotlieb has noted, the galloping charger in the foreground exhibits a posture that triangulates a Muybridgean attitude and the conventional flying or 'hobby- horse' gallop; only the left foreleg, it appears, has been sufficiently crooked.65 More incriminating still, his later works returned to the conventions of retinal representation. In the end, one of the artists most committed to the discipline of scientific empiricism ultimately found the incursion of the Muybridge archive into paint unsatisfying. A second example of the contest over of the role of the Muybridge photographs in the visual arts is provided by Thomas Eakins' 1879 work A May Morning in the Park, otherwise known as The Fairman Rogers Four-in- Hand (Fig. 9).66 Taken together, Eakins' well-documented appropriation of photographs as preparatory aids, his own experiments with instantaneous cameras and biological movement, and his rigorous curricular requirements in anatomy at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art would seem to all but guarantee the compatibility of Muybridge's work with Eakins' paintings. Eakins' students even dissected horses in a watchman- like fashion at a local slaughterhouse (Fig. 10). Also, like Stanford, Fig. 9.

(Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, gift of the artist.) Fairman Rogers, who served on the Board of Directors at the PAFA, was an industrialist with a passion for hippology. He invited Eakins' anatomy classes to examine the collection of horses at his farm, and even authored a book on coaching etiquette.68 Rogers commissioned May Morning in the spring of 1879, and Eakins set to work on a number of studies. The final work portrayed Rogers directing a coach in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, but Eakins spent the majority of his preparations on the painting's four horses. Wax models demonstrate the extent to which the Muybridge archive guided Eakins' composition; Eakins directly translated four consecutive phases of locomotion from the serial photographs of 1878 into four equestrian sculptures. However, even though the painter appeared to commit to the representation of instantaneity, he depicted the wheels of the sully as though they were still in motion by blurring the individual spokes. The horses obeyed Muybridgean optics while the wheels adhered to retinal vision. Like Meissonier, Eakins in the end could not commit fully to the visual doctrine of the Palo Alto stills. The painting was, in the words of Eakins' biographer, 'universally condemned'.70 'The fact', wrote one critic, 'is that the human eye cannot follow the swiftly moving limbs of the horse, and any attempt to arrest them on canvas can but result in disaster'.71 On the one hand, we might consider this line of argument as one of many charges of 'excessive reality' levelled at Eakins throughout his career. For instance, in an 1879 article concerning Eakins' pedagogical philosophy - around the same time he drafted May Morning - one Scribner's contributor responded to the painter's demanding curriculum with this criticism: 'a constant attention to the mechanism of art does little to quicken one's sympathy with the spirit which is the vital element of every work of art, and lacking which, however correct, every work of art becomes lifeless'.72 68.

As before, critics saw no place for mechanised optics in the creation of 'action painting'. The Philadelphia Press maintained that 'as a mechanical experiment it may be a success ... but as to the matter of framing the experiment, hanging it in a picture gallery, and calling it A Spring Morning in the Park, we have to express a judgment decidedly adverse' 73 Especially disconcerting was Eakins' attempt to synthesise ocular and mechanised systems of representation. The juxtaposition of the frozen horses and the spinning wheels was too much for Eakins' student Joseph Pennell, who thought the horses looked 'petrified', while the coach seemed to be 'on the point of running right over the horses'.74 Similar doubts nagged at least one viewer of Meissonier's Friedland, 1807 (Fig. 8) when it came up on the auction block in New York in 1887: [The riders] are all posing, and they are painfully drawn with hard lines and microscopic details, so that it is impossible for the mind to accept both the artist's statements at once: that the men are galloping madly along, and that they are going so slowly as to permit us to count their buttons and examine the seams in their uniforms. The artist should have told us only one of these things at a time.75 As the controversy over these paintings elucidates, dissenters no longer devalued stop-motion photography on the basis of its relative fidelity. Rather, they contended that Muybridgean optics represented the lesser of two competing truths within the province of art. '[T]he artist must fail', argued one reviewer of this canvas in 1881, 'when he attempts to depict what is, instead of what seems to be'.76 Where Stanford's supporters proffered the stills as a gift from industry to the art world (even as they intimated the superiority of mechanised over artistic vision), sceptics claimed the painted canvas as a refuge outside the domain of the industrial gaze. In so doing, they also rejected both Stanford's proclaimed munificence and the highly touted social utility of the Muybridge archive. Coda: Stanford's Instrument These storms of objection may help explain the paucity of images of human bodies within the Stanford-Muybridge collaboration.7 In early August 1879, a group of athletes from the San Francisco Olympic Club did actually perform at the hippodrome and Muybridge successfully executed serial stop-motion prints of 'boxing, wrestling, fencing, jumping, and tumbling.7 These images only appeared, however, in Muybridge's 1881 tome. This gap within the Muybridge archive cannot be accidental. One would expect, for example, that the alleged scientific and economic value of the equestrian stills would be equally applicable to studies of human motion. At the same time, one might also expect equal, if not greater, scepticism, distaste, and outrage. If commentators cried out against the images' apparent violence to horses, then one can only imagine how much more disturbing the human form would appear through the lenses of the industrial gaze. Unfortunately, in light of the public's limited access to Muybridge's photographs of frozen gymnastic feats, evidence is indirect at best. But if, for instance, we return to Thomas Eakins' interview in Scribner's, it becomes evident that the concerns raised about the artist's 'constant 73. Quoted in Amy B.

Quoted in Leja, 'Eakins', p. 484; the original article is Sylvester Koehler, 'Second Annual Exhibition of the Philadelphia Society of Artists', American Art Review, January 1881, p. 110. For Leja, the tensions in Eakins' piece are epistemological in nature, between 'seeing and knowing' (p. 479), or (more metaphorically), between 'the diagram and the illusion' (p. 487). The ultimate goal of this analysis, however, seems to be to establish Eakins as an augur of high modernism: 'His paintings point the way toward modernist work on signs in Cubism, Futurism, collage, and Dada' (p. 490). 77. Of course, the experiments Muybridge conducted at the University of Philadelphia in the 1880s canvassed a wide range of human movement and a larger portion of the animal kingdom. These photographs, however, were taken for different purposes and under different auspices. Their associations with art instruction on the one hand and the city's medical and biological community on the other, for instance, render their meaning and significance distinct from the California experiments and place them outside of this study. 78.

Finally, Haas argues that Eakins' correspondence with Muybridge establishes that the artist is responsible for suggesting that the photographer take up the human form in 1878.

Clearly the reporter was far less discomfited by the students' work at the animal slaughterhouse than by the equally grisly scene of the dissecting room (Fig. 11). 'But the atmosphere of the [dissecting room], the hideousness of the objects!' the author complained to the painter, 'I can't fancy anything more utterly - utterly - inartistic'. 79 In this case, at least, the reduction of human bodies to a watch assembly of mechanical parts was quite literally too much for nineteenth-century Americans to stomach. And yet I think it would still be possible to read the labouring human body, however obliquely, through Muybridge's equine archive. That is, something of the managerial hierarchy of industrial capitalism persists in the figure of the well-bred, disciplined, and submissive horse. My cue for this reading stems from art historian Kirk Savage's work on Confederate military equestrian monuments in the postbellum South. According to Savage, the depiction of man's domination over animals often also suitably expressed the military hierarchy. This image of pure power, moreover, also readily denoted and reinforced other social hierarchies that were not as easily publicly articulated. 'The equestrian image was thus an overripe metaphor, referring ultimately to the nature of power in society. The image of Lee on his horse worked beautifully as a model of leadership for a white supremacist society trying to legitimate its own authority'. Using Savage analogically, I argue that the rationalised images of mechanised horses encoded class in the industrialised West at precisely the same time and in much the same way as equestrian sculptures encoded race in the post-war South. As in Southern Civil War memorials, the figure of the horse evoked associations of power, domination, and caste on behalf of California's industrial elite. It makes perfect sense, then, that the Fig. 11. Thomas P. Anshutz, Dissecting Room, c. 1879, oil on cardboard, 10 x 12 1/2 in.

Situated high on the triumphal Stanford Memorial Arch, Jane and Leland race mounts detailed in exact Muybridgean fashion. As the vanguard leading a Central Pacific locomotive over the Sierra Nevadas, the Stanfords personify the railroad, much like the other allegories along the frieze. Together with the euphemism of mythological Titans, Stanford's imperial presence articulates executive authority at the direct expense of his absent workforce. The citation of the Muybridge experiments through these steeds, finally, references his self- styled gentility, breeding, foresight, benefaction, and scientific knowledge. His mastery over his horse signals that he holds tightly the reins of his 81 corporation. I wish to conclude with one set of images from Muybridge's The Attitudes of Animals in Motion. This picture serves less well as concrete evidence for my argument than as a useful closing metaphor. Photograph 110, as it has been catalogued, depicts a naked, bearded man swinging a pickaxe before the battery of cameras at the kindergarten track (Fig. 13).82 The protagonist is Muybridge himself, which makes this a strange form of self- portrait. The photographer's motivations for appearing nude within the Palo Alto archive may be explained easily enough. As a member of San Francisco's athletic Olympic Club, Muybridge clearly enjoyed demonstrating his muscular prowess; after all, Eakins, another proponent of vigorous, bodily masculinity, also often posed nude for the purposes of art instruction.8 In addition, the photographer lived for four years with the Nahl brothers, the co-founders of the Club, and he personally recruited its members for the aforementioned studies of human locomotion in August 1879. However, this accounts only for Muybridge's nudity. In fact, in every other instance where the cameras capture the frozen images of men, the subjects participate in athletics, and do not labour. As such, Muybridge's actions evoke not some mythical gymnasium from antiquity, but the miners that made Stanford a wealthy Sacramento merchant, or perhaps even the toiling labourers, mostly Chinese, who built the Central Pacific Railroad. However, this image is still more peculiar when we consider the lawsuit that Muybridge brought against Stanford after discovering that he had not been credited in Stillman's book.

Stanford, the railroad baron repeatedly referred to Muybridge as a mere 'employee' to gird his case that he owned the copyright for the images because he initially conceptualised and ultimately paid for them.84During this trial, Stanford further elucidated his opinions in letters to Stillman. One missive insisted that 'the actual facts are from beginning to end that [Muybridge] was an instrument to carry out my ideas'. s Although Stanford would not express these sentiments until a few years after the photographer composed this self-portrait, at times Muybridge must have chafed at his role at the kindergarten track. Although the photographer is still technically Muybridge, the point of view, both literally and metaphorically, is Stanford's. Whether aware of it or not, by performing the role of labouring instrument before his cameras, Muybridge too became the object of the industrial gaze. 84.
