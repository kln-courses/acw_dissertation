Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press [1954]. 360 pp. $5.00. This book's sub-title is significant, since it characterizes cor- rectly what has reached publication of an ambitious twenty-year project twice interrupted by deaths: of Morris R. Cohen in 1947, and of his son Felix in 1953. In terms of the original conception of the author, which envisaged a panoramic and encyclopaedic survey of every variety of intellectual activity in (mainly) nine- teenth and twentieth century America, the present volume is in- deed only a sketch. Projected chapters on American thought in psychology, sociology, ethics, education, and literature had to be omitted entirely. But we may assume that in regard to American thought concerning history, science, economics, politics, law, re- ligion, and aesthetics, we have the substance of most of Cohen's</page><page sequence="2">442 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY mature judgments. The long concluding chapter on General Phi- losophy contains verdicts on more than a score of thinkers, chiefly of the author 's own generation, but devotes nearly half of its eighty pages to Peirce, Royce, James, and Dewey. Nevertheless the sketch is truly a critical one, and Morris R. Cohen was a superb critic of matters intellectual. Readers of his many books and reviews will find few surprises in this volume, but it is well that coming generations should have the benefit of his incisive comments upon his philosophical contemporaries. It is only to be regretted that he did not live to carry his immense task closer to completion. That it proved a baffling undertaking, even after he had given up "striving for contemporaneity," he is the first to admit. The more he tried to fill the gaps in his own broad knowledge of American thought, "the wider," he says, "loomed the seas of my ignorance." What he was seeking was "a philo- sophical position adequate to the understanding of the problems of modern civilization" in America; and, as his son points out, for a pluralist, he "had a remarkable sense of the inter-relatedness of all the fields of human thought." It was in "the coming together of widely diversified ideas that Morris R. Cohen found the promise of American life and the genius of American liberalism. It was in the basic interdependence of opposites, the principle of polarity, that he found a compass for philosophical sanity and a safeguard against all monolithic absolutisms" (pp. 11-12). He was a pioneer in using what is now called the inter-disciplinary approach to such subjeets as philosophy and the law, philosophy and science, phi- losophy and history, philosophy and adult education, and scientific method and the social studies. The scant thirty pages allotted to "The Background of the American Tradition" stress the heavy hands of the clergyman and the lawyer upon this country's intellectual life. It may be re- membered that, as early as 1824, the French precursor of positivism, Count Henri de Saint-Simon, remarked that "the legistes are still today of a great deal too much importance in America"; and, after the lapse of at least a century, Cohen points out that "America has for a long time presented the spectacle of a country not only politically but intellectually governed by lawyers . . . [who] un- til recently, fashioned our social as well as our political ideals." Although he finds the lines of intellectual conflict in America "anomalous and confused," Cohen regards American liberalism in the nineteenth century as less a matter of deep and positive conviction than of "the absence of besetting fears." He regards as "typically American . . . the confidence that our way of life is so clearly preferable to any other way of life that any immigrant</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 443 could be turned into a useful American citizen in the space of a few years," and he predicts that "if that confidence and courage wane-as they seem to have been waning since the days of the first World War-the basic factors which have made American thought distinctive for three centuries will have ceased to exist" (p. 47). An even briefer chapter on Scientific Thought blames American backwardness in pure science upon our aversion to the playful and speculative approach, which is linked to "the Puritan tradition of hostility to games and pure enjoyment." The philosophic at- titude toward science in America he finds to have been "either one of open hostility, advising scientists to keep within their own domain, or one of apparent acceptance but implicit hostility." He deplores the neglect of physical cosmology by James and Dewey as "offering no vistas of nature beyond the human scene," thus subordinating "cosmic to moral considerations, to the hurt of both." We should recognize "the final paradox that science, by seeking the truth in a disinterested manner, regardless of moral issues, may achieve its most useful results" (pp. 74, 85). Through the three chapters on Economic, Political, and Legal Thought there runs the thread of the dominance of lawyers and their favorite doctrine ("all powerful in America at a time when it had lost all prestige in Europe") of natural law. Nevertheless Cohen pleads for a wider recognition of "the great amount of truth" in the theory of natural rights, particularly as a bulwark of liberalism against its arch-enemy, nationalism. He credits Wil- liam James, speaking to the Anti-Imperialist League at the turn of the century, with having foreseen the doom of traditional American liberalism in the growth of international trade, and with having enunciated the sound doctrine that henceforth "our liberals must ally themselves with the liberals of Western Europe" in measures for world cooperation. Cohen 's masterly analyses of the giants of American jurisprudence, many of them his friends, only emphasize his uniqueness among American philosophers in that complicated field. The chapter on Religious Thought refuses to accept the common view that "religious toleration or complete freedom is an achieve- ment based upon the liberal attitude of the American mind." On the contrary, "the actual growth of tolerance in this country came through the need of inviting emigrants and through the actual diversity of the different religious sects. . . ." In aesthetics, Cohen concludes that "our age noticeably lacks the capacity for contemplative enjoyment and goes in for art activity out of rest- lessness. . . ." Most of our literary criticism is dismissed as</page><page sequence="4">444 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ground-clearing for "creative artistic achievement in a land that has been tamed and remains to be enjoyed." As for American philosophy, to Cohen "the fact can hardly be disputed that it has, in large part, been a branch of Christian apologetics. " Our "clerical philosophers " have been so com- pletely absorbed in "traditional theologic issues'" that it is "the astounding fact that, in the face of our unique political experience, we, until very recently, have almost nothing in the way of original contributions to political theory, apart from some pages of Cal- houn " (p. 256). Except for a polite bow to such "powerful minds " among the pious as Shedd anld Hickok, then, Cohen finds little to discuss until the era of evolution, John Fiske, and Chauncey Wright. "If philosophic emiinence," he declares, "were measured not by the number of finished treatises of dignified length but by the extent to which a man brought forth new and fruitful ideas of radical importance, then Charles S. Peirce would be easily the greatest figure in American philosophy. " In part because of Cohen's strong predilection for able logicians, Royce fares much better than James, who "as a seer or prophet fitly to be put beside Emerson" is given credit for creating "a vigorous and healthy stir in the stagnant air of American philosophy" without, however, leaving any "permanent currents of doctrine or even of method" behind him. Cohen finds Dewey's "anthropomorphic naturalism" distinctively "urban, industrial, and entirely public. There are no nooks in his universe which the soul can call its own." He feels that Dewey did ilot "attach sufficient importance to the fact that despite its extreme worth, human intelligence is frail, pathetically impotent in the face of great stress or vital impulse." As for Santayana, some of Cohen's comments are dated, such as his ref- erence to "his systematic neglect . . . [as] an eloquent com- mentary upon the ways, traditions and environment of American philosophy." Comments of one to three pages in length are de- voted to Woodbridge, W. H. Sheldon, Lovejoy, Costello, Boodin, Swenson, Ducasse, Singer, C. I. Lewis, and Whitehead. It is hardly surprising that in the process of editing so large a mass of material, errors should have crept in. One of them, however, results in the introduction of a non-existent Hiram M. Kelley, who, we are told on page 234, "shocked his Harvard friends by finding some real positive merit in popular music. . . ." This individual is undoubtedly Hiram Kelly Moderwell of the Harvard class of 1912, who expressed such views in his The Theatre of Today, first published in 1914 and again in 1937. The author permits himself a page of Retrospect at the end</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 445 of the work, which portrays American thought as "dominated by two interests, the theologic and the psychologic. The development during this period has been to weaken the former and to deepen but narrow the latter and make it more and more technical. For this reason the philosophers covered in this survey have as yet exerted little influence on the general thought of the country . . . until very recently . . . entirely dominated by our traditional eighteenth-century individualism or natural-law philosophy." W. T. Harris and John Dewey are granted some influence in education, and Roscoe PouInd in legal thought. James is "undoubtedly a European force," and there is some international recognition of "the permanent importance of C. S. Peirce's contribution to the field of logic." Like many of Cohen's dicta, these bear the stamp of the nineteen-twenties or thirties. Nevertheless his tart deflations of the more boastful accounts of American thought may long fur- nish needed corrective reminders from a thinker whose critical standards were high. HAROLD A.
