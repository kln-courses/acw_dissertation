Printed in the United Kingdom © 2001 BSA Publications Limited Habermas, History and Social Evolution: Moral Learning and the Trial of Louis XVI Alan R. How Department of Sociology University College Worcester abstract In recent times, under the influence of postmodernist thought sociology has largely rejected the idea of social evolution. An exception to this trend is to be found in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Habermass account of social evolution has received some critical attention, but in sociology wider detail of the picture is not well known. Habermas wishes to hold to the possibility that evolutionary progress can be discerned not only in the sphere of technical control, but also in the sphere of social and moral development. The paper presents Habermas's views on social evoluton within the wider context of his development of critical theory as a 'reconstructive science'. It suggests that his account has been able to resist many of the standard criticisms of evolutionary theory and that a renewal of interest in this area could provide a rich vein of new sociological knowledge. keywords critical theory, Habermas, reconstructive science, social evolution Social evolutionism gets a bad press nowadays, with thinkers as different as Giddens (1984) and Baudrillard (1994) demonstrating their antipathy to any progressivist view of history. To suggest that history exhibits any progressive evolutionary qualities quickly evinces criticism that one is trying to claim knowledge of a spuriously objective process, and that history will inevitably unfold in a pre- given, unilinear way, something Karl Popper (1957) pointed out, is both intellectually absurd and morally dubious. Yet against these charges Habermas (1979, 1980) has sought to sustain the idea of historical progress as part of his wider defence of modernity.1 The parameters within which Habermas makes his defence are well known. Philosophically, he has long fought a battle on two fronts, on one side against the pervasiveness of positivist forms of thought in the social sciences, on the other against the varieties of philosophical relativism, especially postmodernism, which accept the ultimate conditioning of knowledge by its hermeneutic starting point. His claim is that while it is naive to believe that the historical process can be concep- tualised in a scientifically predictive fashion as though it were leading somewhere, it is equally misguided to declare that no generalised (theoretical) knowledge can be gleaned from, or about it. Indeed to declare so, for Habermas, entails an uncritical 177</page><page sequence="2">178 ALAN R. HOW forgetting of our frequently barbaric past, and a nullifying of the future potential of a more universal form of reason. This paper will affirm Habermas's case with an example to illustrate his thesis that at certain historical moments a society may develop evolutionarily more complex, and adequate, forms of thought and action. My claim is that the speeches at the trial of Louis XVI in revolutionary France of 1792, represent such a moment, i.e. a tentative evolutionary shift from a magical-mythico world view to a modern 'rational' and putatively democratic one, and moreover that this was an advance based on social learning. Under the pressure of circumstance, and using the cultural resources available to them, the revolutionaries learnt to distinguish justice from the monarch's 'divine' law, and thereby also culture from nature. The paper divides into four sections. The first deals with the context in which Habermas has developed a new critical theory, emphasising its distinctive features as a reconstructive science. The next describes key features of his theory of social evolution, while the following section examines the trial of Louis XVI using the criteria set out in the previous sections. The conclusion suggests that Habermas's approach avoids many familiar pitfalls and warrants further development. Habermas's theory of social evolution is underdeveloped within his own writing and has received varied criticism. It has been suggested that, (a) the rational qualities it valorises are Western, and the evolutionary trajectory of the West is tacitly assumed to be best (McCarthy 1982); (b) Habermas's identification of social evolution with (Kohlberg's view of) moral development is gender-biased towards a masculinist ethic of justice (Gilligan 1982; Benhabib 1992); (c) it encourages an opportunistic attitude towards historical evidence, denuding it of its full historical density in the effort to make it fit his schema (Honneth and Joas 1988); and (d) Habermas's claim that a model of individual (ontogenetic) development can be transferred to societal (phylogenetic) development is fallacious (Strydom 1992; Eder 1998). I do not intend here to examine how these and other criticisms might affect his case, clearly much further theoretical consideration needs to be given to all of them, something to which Habermas intermittently attends (1982:2^; 1990:175-82). Instead, I flesh out an example to illustrate his programmatic account of social evolution in Communication and the Evolution of Society (i979)&gt; where he draws attention to the need for empirical work. I show that Habermas's ideas, which are usually discussed only at a theoretical level, are capable of empirical illustration, and that empirical evidence bears an important, if unusual, relation to Critical Theory in so far as it is now conceived as a reconstructive science. Context: the renewal of Critical Theory Theoretical background To understand Habermas's account of social evolution it is necessary to</page><page sequence="3">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 179 recognise it as part of his wider desire to refurbish an older Critical Theory that had painted itself into a corner, and whose overall project had reached a theoretical impasse. Implicit in most Critical Theory had been a Marxist philosophy of history, but its substantive analyses suggested, with ever- increasing gloom, that history was coming to an end, being replaced by an instrumentalised totality in which alterna- tives to the 'wholly administered society' were nullified (Habermas 19873:378-83). Of course, the overall view was never as singular as this, but the general mood of Critical Theory was unmistakably pessimistic, a pessimism most trenchantly expressed in Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1979 [1947]), where every increment of Western progress, every step on the ladder of (instrumental) reason was adjudged to be simultaneously its obverse, a regressive retreat into myth and repression. Against resignation in the face of this aporia, Habermas argued, that while enlightenment and myth will always be entwined, differences between them should not be conflated (i987b:chap. 5). Modernity may be riven through by pathologies and distortions of various kinds, but it contains progressive elements too. For Habermas, one of the tasks of social science is to distinguish what is socially rational from what is not, and bring this distinction to bear on contemporary life. The term, 'modernity', is not just the description of an historical condition, but of an 'unfinished project', one that could lead to a more rational society (1996: chap. 1). To distinguish what might count as rational, the social sciences must seek to become reconstructive sciences. On reconstructive science Habermas's references to reconstructive science are scattered throughout his work from the early (1973; 1974:22-4; 1979:8-20; i98o:i6ff; 1982:229fr) through to the later work (1983:258-68; 1990:14-20, 29-41). He came to recognise that his account of critical social science with its interest in emancipation, which formerly he contrasted to the different interests of the empirical-analytic and the hermeneutic sciences, contained a confusion. Critique was not the singular affair he had assumed in Knowledge and Human Interests (1971), but involved two distinct elements, self- reflection and rational reconstruction. Critical self-reflection, either individual or collective, involves becoming aware of the ideological distortions that flow from repressive social arrangements, and incorporating it into life practice. It is a self-formative process. Rational reconstruction, by contrast, involves theoretical reflection on, and reconstruction of, the very rule systems through which human subjects experience the world (including their repression/emancipation). The difference between self- reflection and rational reconstruction is clarified by philosopher Gilbert Ryle's distinction between 'knowing how' and 'knowing that' (Habermas 1979:12*^ McCarthy i978:276ff). Human subjects intuitively know how to communicate without knowing that they are using rules of grammar and a variety of other implicit criteria to produce meaning. The purpose of reconstructive science is</page><page sequence="4">l80 ALAN R. HOW to reconstruct the implicit structural rules underpinning various human productions. Habermas cites as examples Chomsky's reconstruction of the underlying grammar of all languages, and Piageťs reconstruction of human cognition. His own Universal pragmatics' has a similar reconstructive ambition with regard to 'the universal conditions of possible understanding' (1979:1-68). The possibilities offered by such reconstructions, Habermas believes, are considerable; they not only concern indivi- dual competencies, but embrace collective historical learning processes too (such as social evolution), in so far as these also have a reconstructible logic. The implicit privileging of rational reconstruction over self-reflection, and the concern with the structure of understanding ( verstehen ), reflects his engagement at the time with the hermeneutic thought of H-G. Gadamer and the problems it set for his own project (How 1995). Habermas broadly accepted Gadamer's critique of scientism in the human sciences and his claim that language plays a constitutive role in social reality. However, he insisted on the need for sociology to move beyond the remit of actors' linguistic understanding to establish something more theoretically determinate than 'mere interpretation'. Only if it were possible to reconstruct some ground independent of actors' understanding could critique be properly justified; for this Habermas broached psychoanalysis as a template. For Habermas (1988 [1967] ), psychoanalysis had the great virtue of being aware both of the symbolic-linguistic basis of social reality, and of the way unconscious factors function like 'causes', determining people's lives from the outside. Critical Theory would seek to mirror psychoanalysis but at a societal level, liberating people from the ideological distortions imposed on them by the systemic requirements of a capitalist society. Gadamer responded by questioning the moral right of Critical Theory to assume society was the equivalent of a neurotic patient, arguing instead that 'knowledge' and 'emancipation' were not simple phenomena that could be straightforwardly connected (Gadamer in Mueller- Vollmer 1986:283, 290; and in Ormiston and Schrift 1990:280-7), something to which Keat (1981) in a different context, also drew attention. However, even during the latter stages of his debate with Gadamer, Habermas started to veer away from the consciousness-raising or emancipationist model. To divert Gadamer's criticisms he started to press Critical Theory towards a recon- structionist view of things, where the task would be to reconstruct the anonymous rule systems underpinning everyday life, rather than raising consciousness. Such an approach would thus only have an indirect implication for praxis (Habermas 1974:22-5). The change from Adorno and Horkheimer's archly critical tone to Habermas's increasingly detached, reconstructionist one is also reflected in the latter's 'linguistic turn'. Partly through his debate with Gadamer, Habermas came to see language as one of society's 'meta- institutions'. Language, he argued, played a constitutive role in social reality, providing common normative structures and collective background</page><page sequence="5">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 181 knowledge, enabling subjects to orient themselves towards reality. Language was not a blanket imposition on passive subjects, but an active intersubjective medium through which subjects came to know themselves in relation to others. Importantly too, he saw language in a reconstructionist light, identifying it as having a normative centrepiece: namely, that its purpose (telos) is the achievement of communicative consensus. The task for Critical Theory became the reconstruction of conditions for communicative success. Habermas also sought comparable conditions under- pinning other areas of life, which led him to the moral-reconstructive theory of Lawrence Kohlberg as a way of conceptualising social evolution. Perhaps inadvertently, Habermas's commitment to the formal conditions for communication in language led him away from psychoanalysis. As Whitebook (i995'7-9&gt; 179-96) points out, the 'linguistification' of reality thesis runs into a buffer at the unconscious, as, in spite of Habermas's (or indeed Lacan's) claims, the contents of the unconscious are imagistic, not linguistic representations. They are also messy, perverse phenomena, that sit uncomfortably alongside the tidier, more cognitive reconstructions of Kohlberg et al Nevertheless, in spite of Habermas's waning interest in psychoanalysis, he did still identify it in the early 1970s as a reconstructive science, and the next section uses it, in passing, to illustrate things. Reconstructive science and empirical evidence Habermas places reconstructive sciences at an epistemological midpoint between the empirical-analytic (natural) sciences, and the hermeneutic (humanities) disciplines; they possess characteristics of both, but differ too. With hermeneutics they share an awareness of the implications that the social world is symbolically prestructured, but reach beyond the limitations of life-world interpretation to provide knowledge of a more general, objective, kind. He uses the term 'species-wide compétence' to capture the universal reach of their reconstructions. They are thus theoretical in a way that is different from, but parallel to, natural science. Reconstructive science also bears a distinct relationship to empirical evidence. Its practitioners cannot take up the disinterested attitude of an objective observer to understand data, but rather must engage 'maieutically' with it. By 'maieutically' Habermas is referring to the Socratic process of bringing to awareness something that is only latently present. This involves eliciting from subjects information about their 'pretheoretical know-how' by prudent questioning using systematically chosen examples, a method characteristic both of Freud's and Kohlberg's work. He draws out distinctions between this kind of theory formation and that of the empirical- analytic sciences and the different, but still 'universal' kinds of knowledge they produce. Psychoanalysis, for example, is more than just the analysand's own (hermeneutic) self-reflection, it is self-reflection guided by Freud's theoretical .</page><page sequence="6">182 ALAN R. HOW reconstruction of the mental life history of human subjects. However, psycho- analysis cannot proceed by measuring data (what the analysand says) against abstract general principles as if it were an empirical-analytic science. The analysands 'evidence' does not present itself as just a perceptible object in reality, but as a claim about reality, the meaning of which has to be interpreted to be explained. Moreover, explanatory success is not achieved technically but depends on the analysand genuinely accepting its validity. The language of reconstructive theory cannot place itself on a different level from its object, as can that of natural science. The latter usually produces knowledge which refutes everyday understanding, replacing it with something which is (provisionally) correct. In contrast, reconstructive science renders something explicit rather than falsifying it. It explicates what is there by devising another account which makes its nature apparent. The need to avoid naively confusing the claims of different paradigms is important when the subject matter is normative, as it often is in sociology. In this paper, for example, it would be epistemologically misleading, and morally dubious to try to prove by empirical-analytic means the moral adequacy of one form of life over another. Nevertheless, the reconstructive social sciences are usually faced by the problem that their subject matter is both normative and empirical. Habermas (1990:37-41, 117-19) believes that the relation between these two poles should be one of reciprocal clarification and indirect mutual testing. Empirical claims presuppose the validity of normative theory, while 'the validity of the normative theory is cast into doubt if the philosophical reconstructions prove to be (empirically) unusable' (1990:39). Neither side can validate the other, but their mutual dependence means the more congruence there is between them, the more they show the same kind of patterning, the more adequate we should regard the theory. Thus with the example of the trial of Louis XVI in revolutionary France, I draw attention only to the (empirical) motifs and styles of argument used by the revolu- tionaries, which I believe share an isomorphic relationship to learning processes (normatively) identified by Habermas as evolutionär ily more adequate.2 Holding on to progress: the theory of social evolution Reconstructing historical materialism? Habermas's approach to social evolution is set in the context of a recon- struction of Marx's historical materialism. Habermas claims that Marx tends to conflate accounts of the capitalist system and its lifeworld, which leads to a loss in the perceived significance of the latter, and to the assumption that the real locus of all social rationality is to be found in economic relations where instrumental forms of thought and action hold sway. In fact more reciprocal, communicative ways of going on are just as decisive in ensuring the social integration of a society, and should be considered no less rational.</page><page sequence="7">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 183 Marx's case for social progress, baldly stated, was that the dynamic of social development could be found in the conflictive relationship between a society's forces and relations of production. This relationship has often been interpreted in a fairly technologistic way, with the endogenous development of better forms of technical control over the physical environment seen to pull new more adequate forms of social (class) relation into existence. These social relations are held in a precarious state of equilibrium so long as there is structural compatibility between the forces and relations of production. However, while this way of looking at things may help us explain the existence of system problems, it says nothing about how they are resolved. Structural incom- patibility may trigger problems but does not itself bring about change; for that to occur new forms of social integration must be established. Indeed Habermas (1979:133-5) presses this claim still further, suggesting in Weberian fashion, that sometimes a release of potential in the productive forces requires a new form of social integration as a prior condition, i.e. sometimes norms are the pacemaker of change. Habermas's point is that the human species may learn not only in the instrumental sphere of technically useable knowledge, but also in the communi- cative sphere of moral-practical knowledge. It is in this latter sphere that new world- views which will underpin new forms of social integration, are developed. A new world-view may or may not develop in response to system problems, but world- views do have a logic of their own that exhibits progressive tendencies, and these can be reconstructed. It was the publication of essays in the mid-1970s that raised the issue of whether Habermas, with his invocation of the Lockwoodian distinction between social and system integration, of Weberian motifs, and of his own communicative version of the 'linguistic turn', was replacing rather than reconstructing historical materialism (Habermas 1979)- For some (Jay i984:chap. 5, Ingram i987:chap. 1) it was a reconstruction, for others (Rockmore 1989) it marked a shift from the Marxian trajectory. However, to me, his moves are better understood in terms of their relationship to the ideas of first generation Critical Theory, to which they are both a critical response, and a continuation. Where Horkheimers and Adornos dark vision was of a 'wholly administered society', in Legitimation Crisis (19 76) Habermas sees the success of contemporary capitalist economic relations being paid for by putative crises at the specific level of social integration. His subsequent work on social evolution springs from a belief that some forms of integration should be thought evolutionarily more rational than others. Distinctions in action In his reworking of Marx's ideas, and in order to gain a purchase on the nature of social integration, Habermas distinguishes between the logic of work and the logic of interaction. The former referred to the necessarily purposive- rational</page><page sequence="8">i84 alan r. how relationship human beings had to nature, and entailed action oriented towards the successful manipulation of objects. The latter referred to the communicative relationship between subjects, and entailed a different form of action, that oriented towards reaching agreement. Successful action in the latter could not be judged technically correct or incorrect, but gained validity through mutual recognition and acceptance by others. Through engagement with the philosophy of language in the 1970s Habermas modified the labour/interaction distinction. It had to be acknowledged more clearly that people acted communicatively even when their action was oriented towards objects, and also that they could act manipulatively when oriented towards other subjects. The modified distinction went three ways between instrumental, strategic and communicative action. Strategic action had both instrumental and communi- cative qualities, and served to acknowledge the complexity of action while holding on to the specificity of the communicative form. The distinctions between different forms of action remain important in Habermas's work and inform another sociological distinction between system and lifeworld. In the theory of social evolution they enable him to mark off an evolutionary domain that is different from that of nature, and develop a theory based on the distinctiveness of social learning. Learning to 'differentiate', learning to 'integrate' The basic idea of social learning is straightforward, it refers to the possibility that people can improve, or become more accomplished in, the way they solve social- moral problems. Of course, success in this domain is not to be judged in terms of technical efficacy, i.e. 'merely getting a result', but in terms of the communicative validity of the reasoning involved; to do this Habermas employs the ideas of the Piaget-Kohlberg tradition of developmental psychology. For Piaget and Kohlberg learning is not conceived in behaviourist fashion as the 'passive' acquisition of knowledge, but as an active, innovative human process that can, retrospectively, be seen to exhibit a developmental logic made up of increasingly complex stages. These stages provide the structural conditions in which problems are solved, and evolution consists in subjects reaching higher, more comprehensive levels of understanding. Kohlbergs (1971) argument is that individuals, in terms of their moral reasoning capacity, go through a maturational process which displays increasing levels of adequacy. This involves an increasing capacity to 'differentiate' and 'integrate'. Through differentiation an individual is able to distinguish specifically moral judgements from other kinds of value judgement. For example, a young child, unlike an older person, will not distinguish between doing something because it is right, and doing it to avoid punishment. 'Integration' refers to the degree to which an individual can incorporate conflicting claims to resolve conflicts. The more points of view the level of thought can accommodate, i.e. the more extensively an individual</page><page sequence="9">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 185 can appreciate the views of others, the more thoroughly integrated individuals will be with their social environment. The former can be seen as a recognition of the specific character of the moral realm, the latter, of the importance of using wider, more 'universalising* criteria, the better to establish a higher level of general validity.3 Here, I shall only be concerned with the emergent capacity at the trial of Louis XVI to differentiate the moral realm of human justice from that of nature. Habermas wants to hold on to the progressivist impulse in Kohlberg's onto- genetic model of individual moral development and apply it to the phylogenetic thesis that societies learn too, i.e. they exhibit progressive evolutionary tendencies at various levels, including the level of social integration. He expresses the claim tentatively, that a necessary homology exists between individual and collective learning behaviour, in that individuals, in their learning, draw on the collective representations that make up their cultural horizon. As a result, when a world-view becomes overstretched with the task of providing the framework for solutions to problems generated in other societal areas, it may trigger evolutionarily innovative learning responses which effectively enlarge the scope of the world-view, permitting new solutions to emerge. Kohlberg's work is quite well supported empirically and retains the flexibility needed to avoid the more direct accusation that Habermas is trying to impose a 'logic' on history. For example, different levels of social development may be present in the same society at the same time (Habermas 1979:156^8). Though the sequence of stages is unvarying, regressions, overlaps and arrested development are not excluded, and there is no inevitable unfolding towards the highest stage. In addition to the limits Kohlberg places on his own work, Habermas distin- guishes between the developmental-logic and the actual dynamics of moral- evolutionary change, in that being able to discern a developmental-logic tells us nothing about the mechanisms of social change which are historically contingent. A social system problem may in theory overburden the available form of moral-social integration, but what, if anything, is done in response to this, is another matter. Thus, his theory of social evolution is not a theory or philosophy of history at all, but a theory of historical potential, a potential that may or may not be realised. Illustrating Habermas : the trial of Louis XVI Mapping an evolutionary shift In the light of the limitations described above, deciding what should count as evidence of an advance in social integration will always be problematic. However, the manner in which monarchy, as the major source of social integration in European feudal society, was undermined and transformed during the eighteenth century, represents an example. My purpose is to locate the speeches that put monarchy on trial in France in 1789 on the map of social evolution outlined by Habermas.</page><page sequence="10">l86 ALAN R. HOW Habermas distinguishes between four kinds of historical society and their respective forms of social integration, splitting the latter into three different levels. The integrational forms are those of Neolithic Societies, Early Civilisation, Developed Civilisation and the Modern Age. The levels into which social integration can be (tentatively) divided are (a) structures of action, (b) world-views as determinants of morality and law, and (c) structures of institutionalised law and of binding moral representations (1979:157-8). The kind of transformation expressed in the speeches at the trial of Louis XVI, I believe, represents a shift from Early to Developed Civilisation at level (b) and to some extent level (c). More specifically, the speeches show the process of what Habermas calls the move from 'mythological world-views', which have 'legimitating functions for the occupants of positions of authority', to one where there is a 'break with mythological thought' and the emergence of a 'rationalised world view' - level (b); and from a situation where laws and moral representations are 'attached to the reference point of the ruler' to one where they are not - level (c) (1979:157). In short, the speeches made at the trial of Louis XVI, or rather the debate over whether he could be tried, marks the creation of a new principle of social integration, one no longer based on the myth of the divine right of the king, but on putatively universal rights of the human subject. On the cusp: from the mythico-magical to the modern Habermas (i984:45ff) describes the differences between mythico-magical and modern forms of thought and action using Claude Lévi-Strauss and Maurice Godelier as his anthropological guides. Among the features he identifies is the way the pre-modern mythico-magical world view, unlike the modern, conflates culture and nature. Under the mythico-magical world view culture and nature are seen to be co-extensive such that nature is imbued with mythical qualities, while culture is seen in what we would now call a naturalistic light. Thus, nature has quasi-human, anthropomorphic qualities, while culture is the reified natural product of anony- mous, superhuman powers. Only with the advent of modernity, when nature and culture become differentiated, is it possible to discern the real character of each domain correctly. Only when nature and culture historically start to peel apart can we see what the domain of culture is really like and thus also the real nature of moral reasoning as a particular form of human communication within that domain. Of course, it could be argued that our modern capacity to differentiate nature and culture is a historically contingent capacity emerging in the specific context of Western history, and that this is not a good reason for assuming its superiority to the undifferentiated condition. However, Habermas does not seek to deny the historical contingency of the differentiated world-view, for the fact that it emerged in a particular historical context tells us nothing about its validity. Nor on Habermas's account does its superiority depend on its substantive historical contents, but it lies in what he calls its formal-pragmatic qualities, which refers to his concern with the</page><page sequence="11">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 187 form reasoning takes in a differentiated world-view. When we learn to distinguish between nature and culture we are able to develop a sense of ourselves as separate, both intersubjectively and subjectively, from the external world of nature. We see more accurately what flows from human volition and what inevitably from the external world, and therefore come to know what being human is really like. Only when culture is de-naturalised does it come into view properly, as an intersubjective product and thus as something criticisable, i.e. something which could be otherwise. The superiority of the differentiated world-view is thus two-fold: (a) it more accurately grasps the real nature of object domains (e.g. culture, morality etc.) and (b) its fallibility is the source of the potential for freedom and self-determination. On learning to demythicise monarchy: the king's two bodies My claim is that Louis XVI's trial represents a historical conjuncture where nature and culture start to separate and a new societal organising principle comes into being. To be sure the public trial and execution of Louis did not entail a complete and final shift away from the mythico-magical towards the modern view of things. The monarchy in France did survive and retain some vestigial sense of mystery, but never again could it reproduce its earlier significance, tending instead to function as a kind of back-up justification for the power of others, rather than being the unimpeachable and self-evident mythic centre of society. What the process did involve was a society learning to separate the domains of nature and culture as an unforeseen consequence of having to solve a particular problem. For the revolution to succeed, it was argued by Jacobins and Girondins, the trappings of the ancien régime had to be expunged, and for this to happen the effects of its most potent symbol, the monarchy, nullified. The problem was how Louis could be brought to public trial and execution when his status as an inviolable monarch precluded it. Only by finding justifiable ways of partially uncoupling his inviolable status from that of ordinary citizen, could the problem be solved. The seemingly simple solution would have been to kill the king and have done with it; but the revolutionaries knew that mere assassination would leave the monarchy intact as a permanent, potent, threat to the revolution's legitimacy. The assassination of kings long predated the killing of Louis XVI, and the fact that regicides could suffer horrific physical punishment (Foucault 1979:3-7), to say nothing of eternal damnation, had been no deterrent. For all the drama that might surround these events, monarchy itself remained intact, because it was the question of rightful succession, not abolition, that was at stake. However, with the public trial and execution of Louis the monarchy itself was thrown into question (as with Charles I in England). The mystery of kingship could not be sustained if the king himself were judged by those who claimed to be his peers and who were able to publicly declare their actions the rightful source of justice.</page><page sequence="12">l88 ALAN R. HOW Public regicide, as opposed to private assassination, shifts the perceptual locus of a world- view away from the king's inviolability towards his culpability. Culpability of course assumes not divinity, but membership of a moral community, and thereby the right of that community to evaluate what its members do. Walzer (1974:5) puts it aptly when he says that the mystery of monarchy 'can survive a thousand assassinations but not one execution'. A challenge to monarchy required that the revolutionaries hold Louis's mythical qualities in check sufficiently to allow his mundane qualities to come to the fore, and have his actions judged like those of any other citizen. To effect this challenge they had to draw on moral-legal forms immanent to the very regime they were trying to end, chief of which was the idea of the king's 'two bodies'. Ernst Kantorowicz (1997 [1957]) has demonstrated that in mediaeval Europe Christian kings possessed two bodies. One was the mundane, frangible body of any human being, the other was a body touched by the divinity of God. These two bodies were an indivisible unity in a manner which echoed the mystery of the Christian Trinity. To be God's deputy on earth meant that when one's physical body died the immortal soul migrated, not to heaven, but to the next in line to the throne. The king was extraordinary, not by virtue of his inviolable political position, but because he was infused with godliness. Indeed his 'political' position sprang from his god-like qualities, which were living proof that God intended men to be ranked unequally on earth. The link between the monarch and wider society was also expressed in the same organic terms as the relationship between Christ and the Church. As Christ was the mystical head of the Church, which itself was Christ's body on earth, so the monarch was the mystical head of the body politic, and the different parts of society his lesser organs. It was because the king was 'twice born', once an ordinary man, once God's chosen head of an organically unified society, that the death of monarchy could lead to the death of the ancien régime . The revolutionary argument For the revolutionaries to succeed it was necessary for them to clothe their revolt in moral-legal forms that pertained to the ancien régime as these were the forms by which France knew itself, yet at face value they were of little use. It was not just that God's deputy was above the law, he was the law. He might be a sinner in God's eyes but there was no action whatever for which he could be impugned on earth. It was therefore a nice irony that when Louis was brought to trial it was for treason, an offence which at one level he could not commit, except contradictorily against himself (Walzer 1974:42-6). How then was the accusation of treason effected? The revolutionaries, particularly the Girondins, relied on the ambiguity between the king's 'two bodies' to speak of the king as an ordinary man existing independently of</page><page sequence="13">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 189 la nation , and thence to mete out revolutionary justice to him for betraying the nation. However, to treat the king thus was no simple matter. The revolutionary arguments were extensive and convoluted, and as with the nature of living debate, often simply confused. I shall therefore not attempt to do more than illustrate the way the revolutionaries drew on the equivocality of the king's status to make both him and the monarchy prone to human justice. Louis's status as an inviolable monarch had been recognised by the revolutionary constitution of 1791, though his behaviour in seeking help from foreign armies to overthrow the revolution, and indeed his continued existence as kingly incumbent of Europe's grandest monarchy was a plain denial of the legitimacy of the revolution. The Jacobin leaders opposed the idea of a trial, wanting to move straight to execution on the grounds that the longer the king lived the more his mystical presence as the embodiment of France would cast doubt on the revolution. The Jacobins are often accounted a more revolutionary group than the Girondins, but in terms of the theory developed here, they are not so. The Jacobins were certainly more singular and vehement in their opposition to anyone who opposed the revolution, and this is reflected in their desire to kill the king quickly. However, while their killing was to be a public execution, the urgent need they felt to speed things along still echoed a fear of the king's mystical persona, and their proposal is thus quite close to traditional assassination. On 13 November 1792 Saint- Just warned the Convention: this man [the king] ) must reign or die. He will prove to you that all his acts were acts of state, to sustain an entrusted power; for in treating with him so, you cannot make him answer for his hidden malice; he will lose you in the vicious circle created of your own accusations. [Walzer 1974:123] Saint- Just certainly recognises a duality in the king's persona in that trying him as a monarch will lead his accusers to accept too much royal inviolability and too little ordinary human malice. But the Jacobins were still relying on the king's claim of inviolability to bring off their case and in this they were less radical than the Girondins. His inviolability, they argued, was actually evidence that he did not deserve the justice proper to ordinary men; the king had never been an ordinary citizen of France, he claimed to be above the laws of ordinary men, and thus could not expect the treatment accorded them. His inviolability was proof that he was an outsider, and that having conspired with the enemies of France he could expect summary treatment as a traitor. By contrast the Girondins favoured using legalistic methods to secure the revolution, and their break with tradition was more fundamental. At the heart of the Girondin case was the belief that in some crucial sense Louis really was, and always had been, an ordinary citizen, and by virtue of being citizen Capet, he could, and</page><page sequence="14">190 ALAN R. HOW should, be subject to the claims of ordinary justice. Of course, Louis could, on the basis of his 'two bodies', be thought either way, as an inviolable monarch or an ordinary citizen. The Girondins chose the latter, they saw their task as placing Louis's mythical status in a secondary position to his mundane one, with the former deriving from the latter. It had been the case that French kings had once been elected by their aristocratic peers but this scarcely made a dent in their mythical status (Walzer 1974:47-8). Rather the Girondin case turned on Louis's acceptance of the revolutionary Consti- tution of 1791 which actually recognised him as France's inviolable monarch. One strategy the Girondins adopted was to argue that the revolutionary constitution protected Louis from political prosecution perse, but not as a man from prosecution for ordinary crimes. Condorcet declared that his crimes were foreign to his royal duties: It was not as king that he paid for libels to ruin the credit of the nation, that he sent subsidies to the enemies of France, that, in concert with his brothers, he formed a league with the enemies of the nation; it was not as king that, in spite of the laws which he himself had approved, he armed foreign troops against the citizens of France. [3 December 1792] The attraction of such an argument was that it acknowledged the tradition of Louis's dual persona while using it to further the case for a trial, and a trial for the Girondins would be a decisive act of iconoclasm. What could be more undermining of a monarch's mythic status than for a king to answer a legal accusation put by citizens, that he had betrayed the country he was supposed to embody. However, perhaps more radical still was a second Girondin claim that Louis's inviolability had been bequeathed by the revolutionary Constitution, and accepted by him in 1791. It was claimed that these two acts drew on the prior authority of a social contract which exemplified the ultimate sovereignty of the people. Jean Baptiste Maible, though not strictly a Girondin, presented with clarity the idea that inviolability presupposed a social contract: everywhere kings were created to execute the laws which govern us all . . . they must everywhere have been inviolable in that to strike against them would have been to strike against the nation they represented. Yet if they broke their vows . . . did not the nation itself have an undying right, rooted in nature, to call them before its tribunal ... Is not the right of every nation to judge and condemn its kings a necessary condition inherent in the social act which placed them on the throne? [7 November 1792:101] Vergniaud, for the Gironde, argued along similar lines. To assume 'total inviolability' would absurdly place Louis beyond the nation, when in fact he was intimately bound up with its fate - he was after all in one of his bodies, almost literally the head of state. Louis was thus an insider, that was why he could be tried like any other citizen. If he wanted to claim inviolability, Vergniaud declared, he</page><page sequence="15">Habermas, History and Social Evolution 191 should remember that it was something that had been bestowed by the people and they had the right to withdraw it. He did not mean that the people's promises were to be given lightly but that the people could not cede their sovereignty, they 'could never validly renounce the right to punish an oppressor' (p. 197). Historically speaking, breaching the unity of the king's two bodies was not new, but previously it had only resulted in the power of the mythical persona over- whelming the mundane one, thus affirming the mystery of monarchy as society's mainstay (Kantorowicz 1997:9-23). However, with the revolutionary arguments I have briefly sketched, the breach went much further, and with the Girondin argument the trajectory reversed: the king's divinity was placed in a secondary position. The Jacobins certainly toyed with the breach, but their efforts to secure Louis's execution by deeming him an outsider in virtue of his inviolability, still echoed the mystery at the heart of royalist claims. In contrast, while the Girondins drew on the same tradition, they emphasised Louis's unity with the people to render him an ordinary man through and through, and thus subjected the ancien régime to the claims of a new, unmythical justice based on the rights of everyone. Conclusion The speeches at the trial of Louis were driven by a need to secure the revolution from deeply embedded convictions about the divinity of monarchy and the legitimacy of the ancien régime . The problems that generated the revolution were insoluble within the framework of the ancien régime , but to overthrow it would entail more than the mere assassination of its symbolic head. It required the generation of a new framework wrought from the old, in which a new form of legitimacy could come into view. In Habermasian terms it signalled the emergence of a new principle of social integration, one which differentiated culture from nature allowing a morality of putative universal rights detached from the mythical source of the monarch's persona to appear. The evidence also suggests that the process was a learning one in that the issue of what to do with the king involved new, innovative ways of conceiving reality, of learning that justice could no longer be properly derived from a 'divine ruler' but must be detached from him and based on a common morality that affected all. Certainly, as Walzer points out, the revolutionaries knew that the whole of France would learn from what happened to the king something of what justice might mean under the new regime, would learn in effect what the new regime altogether meant for them. In theoretical terms it is important to remember that empirical evidence must stand in an indirect relation to the wider normative claims of the theory. The emergence of empirical structures heralding a new world-view should not be confused with the idea that what followed historically was simply a better world. Our</page><page sequence="16">192 ALAN R. HOW modern world- view may have broken with its mythical predecessor, but any simple claim to superiority is undermined by the recognition that the rationality of our lifeworld has been heavily colonised by (capitalist) system imperatives. Nevertheless, the theory still tries to make good the intuition that one world-view does not just follow ; but comes into being instead of another (q.v. Runciman 1998:170). Equally the philosophical claims to greater adequacy of one world-view over another must be open to empirical investigation if the theory is to stand as a sociological one too. If one adheres to Habermas's account and finds evidence of a higher form of reasoning in a premature historical period when it should not have been possible, then the normative-philosophical logic of the theory would come into question. It was, in part, discrepant empirical evidence in Kohlberg's claims that opened up its normative logic to the criticism that it was gender-blind (Gilligan 1982; Benhabib i992:chaps. 5 and 6). Nevertheless, this theory of social evolution, does have the merit of not seeking in objectivist fashion to break with the hermeneutic context about which it theorises. The task of reconstructing a world-view involves eliciting maieutically from the evidence what its underlying form is, not superimposing ready-made judgements. The task is extensive in that many examples are needed before definitive claims can be made. There is always the danger that what one reconstructs is based on a misleading choice of examples, or that one overgeneralises from too few examples (Habermas 1990:32). However, the size of the task should not deter us from mining as potentially rich a vein of sociological knowledge as this.
