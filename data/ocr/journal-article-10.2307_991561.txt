<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Idea of the Mandala as a Governing Device in Indian Architectural Tradition SONIT BAFNA Georgia Institute of Technology he notion that magical diagrams called mandalas (Figure 1) underlie most traditional Hindu archi- tectural production has become well entrenched within current thought. What it means to have a mandala underlie a building or city, however, is not always clear. For several writers, the role of these diagrams, especially the Vastupurusaman.dala drawn as a square grid, is to act as a planning guide: streets in a town, the walls of a building, and functional zones within built structures are, according to this view, laid out upon the grid lines of a mandala. As a consequence of this notion, any existing historical structure of Hindu patronage that bears signs of an orthogonal grid, or even exhibits a square profile, is interpreted as having been designed upon the Vdstupurusaman.dala . But scholars who try to probe further, to determine how and to what extent such structures could have been generated using the mandala, invariably run into difficulties.2 Although a great deal has been written on the topic, very few scholars have attempted to describe the precise manner in which the man- dala could have acted as a generative diagram. This paper is born partly out of curiosity regarding the role of this enigmatic device, and partly out a sense of frustra- tion with the uncritical manner in which this topic is popularly discussed. Few realize that the idea of the mandala as a gov- erning diagram gained currency only toward the mid twenti- eth century. It was during this time that the study of Indian architecture also began to rely increasingly upon traditional Indian sources for classification and interpretation of docu- mented buildings. Both these trends, the idea of the governing mandala and the study of Indian architecture from an indige- nous perspective, can be directly related to the development of systematic studies of traditional literature on architecture typically classed under the rubric vastusastra or silpasastra.3 It is from this literature that most, if not all, of the evidence sup- porting the idea of the generative mandala is drawn. Sources of Evidence: The Vastuisstra Literature Traditional writings on vastusastra are scattered within an extremely diverse body of literature, ranging from general encyclopedic works to technical manuals meant for profes- sional artisans and sthapatis (a sthapati is the person in charge of an architectural project).4 Examples of the technical trea- tises include texts like Mdnasara, Mayamatam, and Apardji- taprchha, which contain material dealing exclusively with vastusastra. The authorship of these texts is difficult to establish, since they were at times credited to legendary sages in order to lend authenticity and weight to their opin- ions, and at other times, to the patrons who commissioned them. Samaranganasutradhara, for instance, is credited to Bhoja, and Mdnasolldsa to Someshvara. A few later produc- tions such as Silpasarini, Silpaprakdsra, and Rupa Mandana were written largely by sthapatis themselves and described existing tradecraft including contemporary constructional practices and stylistic trends. Much useful material on vas- tusastra is also found in more the general class of Sanskrit</page><page sequence="2">VASTUPURU$AMAND?ALA PILIPINJA 5- 3 9) &gt;9 wU -% 4\1 14W,? AJSYAAN * literature. Some of the Puranas are rich sources of material on artistic traditions, notably the Matsyapurana (chapters 252-270 on making of images and buildings), the Agnipu- radna (chapters 21-106, 263-272, and 317-326 on various aspects of vastsastra), and the Visnudharmottarapura.na. Agamic literature from southern India, including texts such as Kamikagama, Pancaratra, and Purvakagamika, also fea- ture material on vastu and related topics.5 To add to these, texts ostensibly composed on completely different subjects, such as the Arthasastra, a tract on politics and statecraft, and the Brhatsamhita, a treatise on astrology and augury, con- tain valuable material on architecture and related topics. These writings were invariably composed within the context of established regional traditions of building and strongly reflect this, not just in their content and use of technical terminology, but in their language as well, with several texts being composed in regional languages. A num- ber of texts including the Silpasarini, SilpaprakadLa, and Sil- paratnavali illustrate the regional style of Orissan temples. Both Mayamatam and Manasara are related to the southern Figure 1 Kramrisch's description of the generic Vastupurusamandala.

Manusyalaya Candrika and Silparatnam belong to the distinctive woodworking tradition of Kerala, while the Citralaksana of Naganjit is a Tibetan text. Not only does the quality of material in all these texts vary tremendously, but it can also be a very difficult task to date many of them. The problem of dating is worsened by the fact that several manuscripts have been found in a frag- mented state. Dating by writing style or by content is difficult because authors have not been averse to incorporating mate- rial from older texts into their own, resulting in numerous texts that carry identical passages without leaving a clue as to which could have been the original. Typically, texts were pre- served through regularly made copies (the original being rit- ually destroyed), which the copyists felt free to amend as they saw fit. To add to this, there was a general tendency within the authors of these texts (and compilations) to claim that their writings originated in Vedic literature.7 ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 27 om AGNI .APA , PJARJANY JAYANTA INDRA rOGA AM HUKHYlt A B4t M SA IBNUJAGA AlITI PAPA- , '" iAKSHMAN ; _ , SOSA ,, P TI I v I D i A A A.,A suGfttVA i _A R AN.' . . . a'sAyt ASURA I I A .

The old- est writings on vastusastra are perhaps those from the Puranas; the sections on vdstu in Matsyapurdna are believed, presently, to date from A.D. 550-650, with some more being added as late as A.D. 1000. Those in Agnipurdna date to the ninth century.8 The oldest references to architecture and planning are actually from the Arthasastra, traditionally attributed to Kautilya; however, the discussions in this text are related more to issues of social organization and matters of policy, rather than on vtstusdstra per se.9 Brhatsamhitd is another early text that can be dated with some confidence to the sixth century A.D.10 The majority of the existing tech- nical manuals were composed later, after the tenth century. Samardaganasutradhara is dated to eleventh century. 1 Mayamatam bears unmistakable signs of having been com- posed during the reign of the Cholas and therefore must date no earlier than the tenth century, perhaps even later.12 Most of the texts in the regional vernacular, if datable, have proved to be later than the thirteenth or fourteenth cen- tury. Agamic texts have been even more intransigent to dat- ing, although it is unlikely that they were composed earlier than the sixth century.13 The Padavinyas Schemes References to the mandala diagrams, within vastusastric lit- erature, are scattered, fragmentary, and generally obscure. So much so that they seem to have escaped the attention of the earliest scholars who investigated this literature. In Ram Raz's 1834 publication, Essay on the Architecture of the Hin- doos, the first attempt to translate vastusistra texts for the benefit of a modern, non-Brahmin, and nonprofessional audience, there is scarcely a mention of the mandala. Even the Dictionary of Hindu Architecture, edited by P. K. Acharya in 1927 and intended to be a comprehesive list of the tech- nical terms associated with traditional literature on archi- tecture, contains no entries either for "mandala" or "vastumandala." The idea that site plans of towns and vil- lages in India were traditionally based upon "mystical" dia- grams seems to have been introduced around the turn of the century by European artists and scholars who were interested in promoting traditional artistic traditions in India. The writings of E. B. Havell, the influential principal of the Calcutta College of Art, contain passing references to mystical diagrams upon which town and village plans were based.14 But it is Acharya who may well be responsible for giving a more concrete basis to these ideas. In The Architec- ture of the Manasdra, a book credited as being the first trans- lation of a complete vastusadstra text, Acharya makes an explicit connection between the diagrams and town plans.s1 The connection is made within the translation of chap- ter 7, a chapter that provides a descriptive list of square grids used in conjunction with vastupujan, the propitiatory ritual performed on the site prior to building.16 The list begins with a single square (named pecaka) and continues through a sequence of square grids, increasing gnomonically to the largest one (called sakala), which has 32 squares to a side. Most of the text in this chapter is given over to a description of the order in which a given set of deities is to be arranged within each of the diagrams, and the offerings needed to be made to each god or demigod. The individual square or cell formed from the subdivision is referred to as a pada, and chapter 7 of the Mdnasara is titled "Padavinyasah"-a com- pound of pada and vinyas (Skt., arrangement, or distribu- tion).'7 Oddly enough, in The Architecture of the Mdnasara, Acharya rendered this title simply as "Ground-plans."'8 His reasons for doing so lie embedded within various statements throughout the text. Each of these square schemes is associated with a par- ticular building type. Within the chapter that describes these diagrams there is no explanation of what this associa- tion implies; but, scattered within the text are comments and injunctions suggesting that the diagrams may be used in laying out residential plots, temple complexes, and even entire towns and villages. Chapter 36 of the Mdnasara ("On the situation and measurement of dwelling houses"), for instance, discusses the types of grids deemed appropriate for each of the castes, and also prescribes the layouts of the various functional areas of a house in accordance with the deities presiding within each cell of the grid. Similarly, in chapter 9, verses 166-182 mention some of these grids- the sthan.dila (49 squares), the paramasayika (81 squares), and the man.duka (64 squares)-as being appropriate for partic- ular villages depending on their dimensions. Similar statements can be found in the Mayamatam, a text from the same building tradition, and one which Acharya drew upon extensively to supplement his reading of the Mdnasara.19 For instance, while discussing the layout of temple complexes, Mayamatam specifies that "[The diagram for] the main temple is drawn up with four squares: that for the first enclosure is the mahdpitha consisting of sixteen squares, that for the second is maznduka (64 squares), that for the median enclosure, the bhadramahasana (136 squares) and that for the fifth the indrakdnta (1024 squares)."20 These instructions, however, are characteristically schematic and generic; there is little indication within these texts on precisely how these grids are to be used for deter- mining architectural forms. The closest, perhaps, that the Mayamatam comes to specifying an operational instruction is in the following statement referring to town layouts: 28 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="4">There are two sorts of diagrams pertaining to the setting up of all constructions: those consisting of an even number of squares and those where the number is odd. If the number is even, the streets should be drawn along the lines of the dia- gram and, if odd, they should go through the middle of squares.21 This seems clear enough, but when the texts are con- sulted for actual specifications of town, house, or temple plans, there appears to be little correlation with these instructions. Neither the actual dimensions of the towns and villages, nor the number of streets or blocks that are prescribed for most town-planning schemes, correspond to the number of square partitions of the diagrams normally prescribed. In fact, most of the suggested plans for both vil- lages and towns are rectangular and, hence, contain differ- ent numbers of streets in each direction.22 More than that, there is a direct injunction that forbids the planner from constructing upon the lines of diagrams: "Diagrams such as pecaka (with four squares) or asana (with a hundred squares) or those between them should be used; the sage must avoid (building) on their lines and other forbidden places."23 These "lines [sutrani] and other forbidden places [visamsthanani]" actually refer to another symbolic con- struction associated with these diagrams-that of the Vas- tupurusa (the spirit of the site). The Vastupurusa is described as being crooked, hump- backed, and lying face down with his body contorted into the shape of a square.24 According to these texts, the body of the Vastupurusa can be overlaid on-or more properly, assigned to-the padavinyds scheme. Typically, he is fitted in diagonally, with his head in the northeast corner of the diagram, his feet in the southwest corner, and his elbows and knees in the remaining northwest and southeast cor- ners (Figure 2). The deities assigned to the differentpads of the grid can therefore be seen as occupying different parts of his body. The association of the Vastupurusa with the Vas- tuman.dala is clarified in a legend repeated in several major Sanskrit texts. The Agnipurana, for example, describes an evil demigod (bhuta) born during Siva's fight with the Asur And- haka. This bhuta is described as possessing a terrifying coun- tenance and an insatiable hunger. The legend goes that having done a great penance, the bhzta won a boon from Siva that allowed him to swallow the three worlds that con- stitute the Hindu cosmos. As this being stretched himself and began to occupy the heavens, he fell flat on the earth. The various gods and demigods seized this opportunity and pinned various parts of his body to the ground, rendering Figure 2 The Vastupurusamandala with the Vastupurusa laid out within. Note that the location of deities follows the body of the Vastupurusa, not the squares of grid; this is a characteristic feature in the depiction of the Vastupurusamandala. him helpless. This being came to be called Vdstu (or Vas- tupurusa) because the gods and demigods managed to lodge themselves on his body.25 Legends hold that the deities, in pinning him down, occupied different parts of his body and continued to reside there.26 In order to satisfy his hunger, Brahma ordained that he receive offerings from people on building sites before construction; hence, the ritual propi- tiation ceremony. The body of the Vastupurusa, as it lies contorted within the square grid, is supposed to be sensitive at a number of points called marmas. The well-being of the Vastupurusa, according to the vastusdstra texts, assures the well-being of the building and, by implication, its owner. An important criterion for any building, therefore, is to avoid injury to the marmas located on the body of the Vastupurusa. To ensure that this is achieved, texts prohibit any direct con- struction upon the marmas themselves.27 Although the mar- mas are specifically said to lie at the intersection of major diagonals, seen as the veins (siras or nddis) of the purusa, it is common for vastusastric texts to prohibit construction upon other lines of the padavinyas diagrams as well. Despite the contradictions and the irregularity of explanations, it seemed logical for Acharya and his con- ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 29</page><page sequence="5">temporaries to envision these square grids as instruments for the laying out of plans of towns, villages, and temples. In Town Planning in Ancient India, B. B. Dutt agreed with the idea that plan layouts of towns and villages were based upon the padavinyas schemes.28 He seems to have been the first to draw an explicit connection between the padavinyas grids and the division of a village plan into plots in which the roads would correspond to the lines of the ritual dia- gram. It is interesting to note, though, that the diagram according to him was a basis, not so much of formal plan- ning, but of what he calls "folk-planning"-the assigning of particular classes of people to particular sections of the village.29 The idea that the thirty-two padavinyas schemes actu- ally guided most traditional planning became commonly accepted by the 1930s. Though some doubts still remained, especially with regard to matters such as the design of nonorthogonal schemes, problems such as the lack of exist- ing examples that corresponded to these schemes, and the apparent contradictions within the prescriptions of the texts themselves, were attributed to the fragmentary and incom- plete nature of the textual evidence. It was common for scholars to complement what they felt was information missing in one silpas'stra text with passages taken from another; Acharya consistently supplemented his translation of the Manasara with material from the Samaradga.nasu- tradhara, the Sukranitisara, and agamas like the Isanasi- vagurudevapaddhati.30 In any case, the padavinyas scheme was always uncomfortably placed within the context of the tech- nical literature of the vdstu manuals. In these manuals, the series of these diagrams is introduced abruptly, without any explanation regarding its nature and role. While the legend of the Vdstupurusa helps us understand the relationship between the group of deities and the Vastupurusa, the square diagrammatic device is itself not adequately explained. The deities themselves are also something of a mystery-they are not the common deities of the classical Hinduism that had been prevalent since the middle of the last millennium. It was generally believed that the symbolism of these padavinyas schemes was related to ancient Vedic thought, but most authors were content to leave it at that. It was left to Stella Kramrisch, in the late forties, to lay the ground- work for such a connection. Kramrisch and the Ja,stupurusamandala Over time, Kramrisch's monumental publication, simply titled The Hindu Temple, has reached the status of a defini- tive work, and it is not difficult to see why. Collecting mate- rial from a vast range of sources, she assembled the scattered and obscure architectural thought of the subcontinent into a single conception whose roots could be traced back to the Vedic period. She connected the concept of the Vdstupurusa to that of Purusa (the Supernal Man, according to Kram- risch) of the Brahmanical literature, and linked it further to the creation legend of Prajapati (the demiurge).31 In a sim- ilar vein, she located the source of the square padavinyas schemes in the Vedic altars that were ritually constructed by piling up bricks into strictly prescribed shapes, including the square. In addition to the already accepted symbolic notion of the square as the shape of the inhabited earth, the square grid was given a cosmological as well as a ritualistic significance. Based on these ideas, Kramrisch literally reconstructed the generic Hindu temple, step by step, from its conceptual roots to its planning, siting, foundation, base, superstructure, and the overlay of the iconographical patina. For her, all Indian temples-whatever their morphological or stylistic difference-were essentially similar. Their forms had all originated in the Vedic altar, as well as in the sacred enclosure marked off by a railing (vedikd), surmounted by a sacrificial post (yupa), and gradually elaborated to embody an additional dual metaphor of the mountain and the cave. Within this unified idea of building construction, the square padavinyas grids were given meaning as the Vas- tupurusamandala-the mandala associated with vastu. Acharya and other writers had so far interpreted these grids rather pragmatically as planning schemes guiding the layout of complexes and towns. Kramrisch endowed these dia- grams with far more significance than that. In her own words, "The Vastupurusa mandala is the magic diagram (yantra) and the form (rupa) of the Vastupurusa. It is his body (sarira) and a bodily device (sarira yantra) by which those who have the requisite knowledge attain the best results in temple building. It is laid out in tabular notation as man and site."32 The Vedic tradition, according to Kramrisch, conceives of the form of earth as a circle. However, once it is given orientation and made inhabitable, the earth is seen as vastu and is visualized as a square fixed with respect to the cardi- nal directions. The Vastupurusamandala, which is the sym- bolic representation of vastu, is therefore drawn up as a square.33 The forty-five deities mentioned in the padavinyas schemes are arranged in three sets of concentric rings. At the center is the Brahman, the supreme principle. Sur- rounding this are the twelve major deities. In the final layer, distributed along the periphery, are the thirty-two padade- vatds (the minor deities, so called because each is assigned to a pada). Brahma, the "regent of the place" in Kramrisch's inter- pretation, occupies the central region. The twelve deities 30 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="6">surrounding him are identified as the twelve Adityas-the regents of the twelve different "aspects" of the sun.34 These are arranged in a dual sequence. The four sides, beginning from the east and moving toward the south, are assigned to Aryaman, Vivasvan, Mitra, and Mahidhara in that order. The remaining eight Adityas are arranged in pairs at the four corners: Savitr and Savitra at the southeast corner, Indra and Indrajaya in the southwest, Apa and Apavatsa in the northeast, and Rudra and Rudrajaya in the northwest. The thirty-two padadevatas are grouped into four sets, each associated with a particular direction and led by a dikpala, the warder of spatial directions. Mahendra, or Agni, is asso- ciated with the east, Yama with the south, Varuna with the west, and Soma with the north. Each of these directions has a special signification: the east is the quarter of the gods; the south is the region of ancestors; the west is the area of darkness (the inverse of the brilliant Agni in the east); and the north is the region of men. But more than this, the peripheral deities actually trace a circumferential path around the mandala, beginning with Agni in the northeast. In addition to these forty-five deities, eight other "homeless presences" are sometimes indicated on the diagram of the Vastupurusaman.dala; these are, however, always placed out- side the square boundary of the mandala and not allocated to particular squares. It is noteworthy that in her detailed discussion of the entire scheme, Kramrisch does not explain the particular symbolism, or role, associated with each deity. She limits such explanation to broad groups-the Adityas, the lokpalas, or the leading padadevatas of each direction. This is not an oversight on her part; this would, in any case, have been dif- ficult for the simple reason that the particular scheme of forty-five deities associated with the Vastupurusamandala is found nowhere else within Sanskrit literature. For one, it is not a Vedic arrangement. The Vedic literature commonly speaks of thirty-three devatas (and, at times, of six, three, two, one and a half, and even one), but none of these sets corresponds accurately with that of the Vastupurusaman- dala.35 Perhaps the most intriguing fact is that the word Brahma itself does not appear in the Vedas, Upanishads, or Brahmanas.36 Although the conception of Brahma is believed to originate in the Vedic notion of the Prajapati, this does cast doubt on the antiquity of the scheme of deities assembled upon the Vastupurusaman.dala. But, if this partic- ular set of deities is not Vedic in its origins, neither does it appear to be strictly Pauranic. Not only are typically Pau- ranic deities, including Siva and Visnu, conspicuously absent in the Vastupurusaman.dala, several of its minor padadevatas are not recognized as deities or gods within gen- eral Sanskrit literature.37 The broad organizational scheme of the Vastupurusaman- dala (the inner circle of twelve Adityas surrounded by a ring of padadevatas that are arranged in four cardinally oriented groups), however, does follow a well-established tradition with ancient origins. This arrangement has strong astronomical associations: the twelve Adityas are associated with the solar months, and not only are eight of the padadevatas recognized as dikpalas (the Wardens of the Directions), but there have been attempts to correlate the remaining twenty-eight of them with the twenty-seven naksatras (the constellations that lie on the Vedic zodiac).38 At least on broad principles, there- fore, Kramrisch's scheme can be situated within the generic tradition of Hindu thought. The value of Kramrisch's work essentially lies in giv- ing a unified, if not wholly coherent, meaning to what was earlier seen as esoteric, and even irrelevant, symbolism. The mysterious deities of the padavinyas schemes were now seen as significant elements of a Vedic cosmological concep- tion-not arbitrarily assigned to various padas, but follow- ing a systematic order. Following Kramrisch it became common to refer to the padavinyas grids as the Vas- tupurusamandala. The connection itself was not unprece- dented; many of the Agamic texts had traditionally referred to these diagrams as Vastupurusamandalas.39 The crucial step that Kramrisch took was in recognizing the powerful and far-reaching implications of the mandala as a generative idea. What were once seen simply as superficially symbolic, but essentially practical, schemes to be used for ritual pur- poses and, to an extent, for guiding the layouts of complexes and settlements, were now understood as generative devices that carried a profound symbolic conception of the very act of building. As Kramrisch herself put it: The Vastupurusamandala is the plan of all architectural form of the Hindus. The site-plan, the ground-plan, the horizontal and vertical sections are regulated by its norm. Originally and in prac- tice the site-plan is laid out according to the Vastupu- rusamandala; and the "general form of the temple" . . . given in earlier texts, rests on the Vastupurusamandala.40 It is this idea that seems to have taken a firm root within our current understanding of Indian architecture. Mandalas were known to be esoteric, mystical drawings produced by Tantrics-followers of a religious tradition known for its secretive tendencies and unconventional rit- ualistic practices. But what connection could be posited within diagrams associated with a marginal religious cult and those associated with a practical profession? In order to answer this question, we must examine the general idea of the mandala within its Tantric context. ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 31</page><page sequence="7">Tantric Mandala: The Meditational Device The Sanskrit term mandala has traditionally been related to the Tantric elements of both the Hindu and Buddhist reli- gious traditions. Tantricism is an esoteric devotional tradi- tion whose elements pervade all the major Indian religions-Hindiusm, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is gener- ally identified by its focus on specific practices that will lead the devotee to the path of salvation. All these practices essentially involved highly ritualized operations whose pur- pose is to move the practitioner toward a state of trance. Apart from ritualized procedures of recitation of syllables (mantra), making of appropriate gestures (mudra), and med- itating upon concrete manifestation of deities (dhyana), these practices also include the construction of elaborate diagrams-the name mandala being applied both to the practice as well as the diagrams themselves.41 Since Arthur Avalon's renowned translations of Tantric texts, several scholars have written illuminatingly on the practice of the mandala; one of the most thorough of these treatments is undoubtedly due to Giuseppe Tucci.42 His description of the mandalas and of the meditational practice associated with them, although written from the perspective of an insider with a strong empathy for the subject, is analytical enough to provide a useful insight into the nature of these enigmatic diagrams. To the outsider, there appears to be a bewildering vari- ety of mandalas. They vary, not just in their forms, but also in the variety of media that they are drawn in; some man- dalas are temporarily drawn in colored chalk upon a flat sur- face, while others are permanently etched upon metal plates. In addition, while some mandalas are drawn as sim- ple configurations of geometrical figures, others, such as the Buddhist tankas, are drawn as dazzling colored landscapes painted in psychedelic colors upon cloth. According to Tucci, all the mandalas, whatever their overt appearance, are constructed upon a common underlying structural framework. This structural framework consists of one or more con- centric circles, arranged within an orthogonal enclosure. Inscribed within the innermost of these rings is a square with a characteristically inflected boundary. The square is traversed by diagonal lines, which divide it into four trian- gles. Five small circles, one placed at the center and one inside each of the triangles, carry within them emblems or figures of divinities. The intermediate spaces are also dec- orated with additional figures of deities and evocative land- scapes. Within this framework, the complex and strictly prescribed symbolic scheme of the particular mandala unfolds. A brief description of the mandala of the rDor- jeac'an (the Holder of the Diamond) from the Tibetan Bud- Figure 3 The mandala of the rDorjeac'an dhist tradition illustrates one such scheme (Figure 3).43 The outermost circle, which displays an uninterrupted line of scrollwork, represents gnosis-the fire of consciousness that destroys ignorance. Just to the inside of it is the "girdle of diamonds." The diamond, or vajra (rDorje in Tibetan), eter- nal and unchanging, symbolizes the "Supreme Cognition," that is, illumination, which once attained is never lost. The entire girdle of diamonds is the boundary that the Tantric worshipper must cross in order to return to the phase of reintegration with the supreme soul. A ring of lotus leaves is placed inside this to indicate the worshipper's accessibil- ity to the secret. Within this lies a five-layered square, the most secret and essential part of the mandala. The diagonal lines that traverse this square form two opposed triangles, one pointing downward and the other upward. This set of triangles, identified as the "Wellspring of the Law" (dharma), indicates the two-stage ritual of meditation that the worshipper follows; the downward-pointing triangle symbolizes the first phase of expansion from One to All, while the inverted triangle indicates the phase of return or 32 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="8">reintegration. Right at the center of the entire scheme is the diamond seat of the Buddha, the Supreme Conscious- ness. The five-layered square actually forms a boundary between two distinct areas of the mandala-the inner one, mystical and representative of the esoteric universe of "being," and the outer one, representing the physical world, the world of "becoming." As a consequence of the inter- mediate space between two, the five concentric square boundaries are shown inhabited by adoring deities that sym- bolize "the light imprisoned in the psyche, and which awak- ens the primordial consciousness." The square boundaries themselves are not continuous, but broached in the middle of the sides (coincident with the cardinal directions) by four entrances, and modeled on the entrance structures of royal palaces. Between the square and the outer rings are placed various ornaments, such as umbrellas, vases, and standards. These symbolize the instruments of the ritual and offerings that honor sacred places, divine surfaces, and the territory of the king. Despite its detailed symbolic scheme, the mandala is not, strictly speaking, an iconic object; rather, it can be seen as an organized scheme of representation that has to be "read" in a particular manner. The intention behind the exercise of reading is to achieve an altered state of con- sciousness, or, in Tucci's words, to "move from the plane of samsara (the illusory world of reality) to that of nirvana."44 This is an understandably difficult exercise, calling for much practice and concentration. The mandala is an instrument or aid that helps the worshipper, particularly a neophyte, achieve this in a gradual, step-by-step, manner. Each stage is symbolized by images of particular deities or attributes that the worshipper must mentally reintegrate into a single idea. The end stage is when the meditator is able to reach a state of complete identification with the Supreme Con- sciousness, the Buddha. The nature of imagery and symbolism may vary within the different Tantric traditions. In the Saiva schools of Tantricism, for instance, mandalas are constructed with sim- ple linear figures-triangles, squares, circles, and so on. Combined into complex arrangements, these diagrams, called yantras, may be drawn on paper or carved upon metallic medallions. However, the underlying construction of these diagrams is essentially similar to the pictorial Bud- dhist mandalas. One of the better known of these yantras, the Sriyantra (Figure 4), is drawn as series of overlapping triangles-four pointing upward and five downward- placed sequentially within two petalled enclosures, three circular ones, and three squares with the characteristic shiv- ered (sisirita) profile.45 During dhyana (meditation), how- ever, what appears as the set of overlapping triangles is ul a Figure 4 The Sriyantra actually read as a concentric series of star-shaped polygons. The innermost is a three-pointed figure, the next eight- pointed, followed by two ten-pointed stars, and finally by a fourteen-pointed one. The symbolism here is completely different from that of the Tibetan mandala described earlier. Each of these figures is associated with a set of attributes that go into making a complete description of Sri, the deity of the yantra. The generic mandala, then, can be described as having a concentric arrangement of geometrical figures, either elaborated pictorially or simply depicted as linear diagrams. A radial hierarchy dominated by the center governs the arrangement. Enclosed within a square outline, the diagram functions more or less like a mnemonic device, allowing the worshipper to focus his concentration gradually and achieve, step by step, the meditational trance that is the ulti- mate goal of the practice. It is here that the description coincides with that of the Vdstupurusaman.dala, whose orthogonal grids appear, at first, to be completely removed from the Tantric diagrams. It, too, features a group of deities arranged in rings around a dominant center with a radial hierarchy, with the entire arrangement being enclosed within a square. Although drawn as a grid, the Vas- tupurusamandala is actually read as a concentric series of square shapes, in line with the generic idea of the mandala. Still, its symbolic scheme is completely different, and there would, at first glance, seem to be nothing more than a struc- ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 33 EL. -' I</page><page sequence="9">tural link between the Vastupurusaman.dala and the Tantric yantras or mandalas. A set of ancient drawings from Orissa brought to the attention of modern scholarship in the middle of this cen- tury, however, pointed to the possibility of a direct connec- tion-not only of the Vdstupurusaman.dala specifically, but of the generic idea of the mandala itself-with architecture. Drawings in the Orissan Manuscripts and the Architectural Role of the Mandala These drawings come from texts that were discovered by Pandit Sadashiv Rath Sharma during a survey of some Oris- san villages with Atharvavedic antecedents.46 Out of 974 unearthed palm-leaf manuscripts, seven were found to deal with the subject of the Konark temple, four of which con- tained factual contemporary descriptions of different sub- jects related to the temple. The first of these texts is a detailed architectural survey of the Padmakesara Deula ( the main temple) and its surrounding shrines. The original dates from the seventeenth century, though the manuscript at hand represents copies made by those of successive gen- erations. The bulk of the contents of this text consists of actual measured drawings of the temples, and includes com- plete plans and elevations, as well as constructional details. The drawings are accompanied by explanations, captions, and an extensive commentary that enumerates all architec- tural details along their measurements. The second, shorter manuscript, known as the Trikala Mahamaya Arcana Vidhi, describes the rituals for the worship of Mahamaya. The third manuscript, Baya Cakda, is the longest as well as the oldest, dating from the thirteenth century. It provides a chronological account of the construction and the expen- diture of the building operations of the Padmakesara tem- ple. Although the text does not explicitly describe the form of the temple, it remains a valuable source for understand- ing the organization of building operations during this period. The fourth document, a type of priestly manual, describes rituals of worship, but refrains from commenting directly on the architecture or the buildings themselves. Drawings within the first manuscript are of particular interest in that they are a rare surviving example of tradi- tional measured drawings of a known, existing monument. Specifically pertinent here are the plan drawings of these monuments. Each plan has embedded within it a small yantra. In the plan of the Padmakesara Deula (Figure 5), for instance, a smaller diagram is placed within the sanctum (garbha grha) and identified as Bhdskarabhadra Yantra; the one embedded inside the plan of the mukhasala is captioned Suryapancabja Mandala; and the one associated with the nat- mandapa is the nine-squared Grhabja Mandala. The con- struction and use of these diagrams is described in detail in two Tantric texts from the same region-Silpasarini and Saudhikagama. While these drawings of the yantras within temple plans helped promote the idea that the concept of mandala at large had an architectural dimension, it did not leave the matter fully resolved. What exactly was the role of the man- dala within architecture? One interesting direction, which may have suggested itself to mid-twentieth-century schol- ars of Indian architecture, could have come from discus- sions on the design methods of the Gothic master masons among contemporary medievalist art historians. In 1945, Paul Frankl wrote an influential essay on the technical craft secret preserved by the medieval lodges.47 In this he dis- cussed the 1487 publication of a booklet on the design of steeples and pinnacles by Mathes Roriczer (the master mason associated with Regensburg Cathedral), which was supposed to have revealed the "secret of the master masons" to the world at large.48 According to Frankl, the secret was essentially the knowledge of constructional geometry and, in particular, the knowledge of "how to take the elevation from a plan," an example of which is given in Roriczer's booklet (Figure 6).49 The similarity of this diagram with the yantras embed- ded within the Orissan plans is uncanny, and it does not seem too far-fetched to suppose that such examples may have con- tributed to the assumption of a geometrical role for the Vds- tuman.dala as well.50 In any case, an association with the mandala-and by implication, with Tantricism-was to give the padavinyds diagrams an esoteric and magical dimension. Tantricism had always been known for its secretive tenden- cies and unconventional ritualistic practices. As secrecy and restricted distribution of knowledge were already recognized attributes of traditional vdstudsstra, the conception of a mag- ical diagram that encoded secrets related to building theory and practice appeared relatively easy to maintain.51 But what kind of information was the mandala sup- posed to have encoded for the builder? Again, Kramrisch is an informative source on this point. According to her, at least in the case of the temples, if not all buildings, the square grid of the Vastupurusaman.dala provided a basic met- ric for the built form. The squares of the grids were seen as the basic modules upon which the dimensions-not just of the plans, but also, like the geometrical methods of medieval masons, of their elevations as well-were based (Figure 7). As Kramrisch put it, "The drawing of the Mandala gives the 'pitch' according to which the ground plan (talacchanda) has its consistency."52 The dimensions of the temple superstructure, accord- 34 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="10"></page><page sequence="11">i V[ 6 L L 0 1 1 7 1 . e-b g b bp c .9 'I I .3 II ON r If The Governing Diagram As we start to see the gradual emergence through the middle years of this century of the idea of the mandala as an archi- tectural governing device, it becomes evident that the idea was not so much discovered within traditional literature as it was constructed. Starting off as orthogonal schemes upon which the functions of towns or settlements could be broadly arranged, the padavinyds grids had, by the middle of this cen- tury, grown into complex diagrams embodying profound thought on the nature of building and dwelling. The col- lected evidence from different sources-the descriptions of the square Vastuman.dala in the architectural manuals; its mention in the context of the layout of complexes and set- tlements; the more explanatory discussions in the Puranas, Agamas, and other texts; its relation to the legend of the Vds- tupurusa; and the enigmatic depiction of the mandalas/yantras inside plans of temples in the medieval drawings of the Oris- Figure 6 Roriczer's method for the generation of a pinnacle from a square base. The relationship between the square and the elevation of the pin- nacle may have proved suggestive to scholars of Indian architecture. san temples-all went into the idea of the Vstupurusaman- dala as a device governing architectural form. Ostensibly, the silpa manuals cast the Vdstupurusaman- dala as a figural device representing a hierarchical order of the deities that were to be systematically propitiated to ensure successful tenure of a built form. Following Kram- risch's work, it acquired an additional symbolic dimension, one that was both cosmological and anthropomorphic. It was seen as nothing less than the ideal built form of the Hindus, simultaneously representing the shape of the inhabited earth and the hierarchical structure of the ele- ments constituting it. By constructing buildings or cities, the builder was seen as the reproducing agent of this generic form, creating, as some have argued, an identity with the Hindu cosmos at large.54 To this extent, the mandala remained an iconic object, reproduced within the plans of cities and buildings. But the mandala came to acquire an 36 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000 m I ! -f, a -i --f 2 ?*fk IsM</page><page sequence="12">Figure 7 Kramrisch's reconstruction of the method for determining the profile of the Nagara sikhara on the basis of a square grid operative significance as well; through its form and matrix of lines, it was seen as a device that significantly controlled the planning, form, and dimensions of architectural struc- tures-an opinion that continues to persist.55 The Challenge of Unsupportive Evidence How far is this theory supported by evidence? As we have seen, textual evidence on this matter is neither clear nor decisive. On the one hand, there are explicit statements, such as those in Mayamatam, which direct the architect to use grids associated with the Vdstuman.dala for locating dif- ferent buildings or functions while laying out complexes. Both in these and in the injunctions regarding the marnas there seems to be an assumption that a mandala is to be imagined as having been laid out to cover the entire site. In addition to this are the measured drawings of the Orissan temples, with the mandalas embedded suggestively inside the plans. On the other hand, much of this evidence is troubling. There is, for instance, no description within vdstusdstra lit- erature of the actual practice of using the mandala as a dimensioning module, or even as a design aid. Scholars who have puzzled over this silence have generally concluded that the exclusion of specific details was a standard practice in the writing of traditional texts.56 They hold that specific information in these texts was deliberately suppressed, partly because such knowledge was already a part of the working training of the craftsmen, and partly because such information was to be prevented from falling into unquali- fied hands. This argument is not completely tenable, how- ever. There is no consistent suppression of precise measurements or of how-to-do instructions in the vastu manuals. While it is true that several texts were concerned with broader principles and classification, there do exist texts, such as Niranjan Mahapatra's Silparatnakosa (c. 1500), that were written precisely to educate the literate sthapati in technical matters on the design and construction of buildings, particularly that of temples.57 Such texts contain precise measurements of building details and, at places, spe- cific step-by-step instructions on matters such as the con- struction of the gnomon or the testing of the soil. It is in these texts that the absence of directions regarding the use of the mandala to generate forms is the most telling. Moreover, the injunctions regarding the employment of the mandala are themselves stated quite ambiguously. We have already seen that early scholars such as Dutt and Acharya had encountered mutually contradictory opinions in the Mdnasara and other texts. Although these vastu texts contained several generic statements prescribing the use of the ritual padavinyds schemes for particular buildings, the instructions giving the shape and dimensions of plots or building plans did not, themselves, correspond to these generic prescriptions. "The adoption of the foregoing three schemes [Sthandila, Manduka and Paramasayika] was not, however, an invariable practice," Dutt was forced to admit. "... Indeed there was no rigid rule on this point."58 In any case, the essential textual evidence for the gov- erning mandala does not come from technical manuals. Rather it is in the more encyclopedic or ritualistic texts- the Agamas, the Puranas, and so on-that are more often invoked as sources of evidence for the genetic role of the mandala. Among these, the Brhatsamhita has become increasingly important, partly because of the amount of space devoted within it to matters related to the design and construction of buildings, and partly because it is one of the few early Sanskrit texts about whose date there seems to be a comparative accord among scholars. The Brhatsamhitd devotes two chapters on silpasastra: chapter 54 is on Vastuvidya and chapter 56 on Prasddalak- sanddhyaya (the characteristics of temples).59 The chapter on Vastuvidya is the most extensive one within the whole text. It begins with a version of the legend of the V-s- tupurusa and, after briefly describing the diagram (yantra) within which the vastu deities are to be worshipped, goes on to discuss types of houses, their classification and appro- priateness for different castes, their dimensions, location of ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 37</page><page sequence="13">openings (related to the location of sensitive points), selec- tion of site, and construction material. The other chapter is much shorter, enumerates a list of temple types, and dis- cusses the characteristics of each. Nowhere is a direct con- nection made between the diagrams on which the deities are propitiated and the typology of house plans or temples. The only place where these diagrams are indicated as being present coincidentally with the plans of houses is within the section that deals with the topic of marmas; the main use of the diagrams, in this case, is to locate the marmas upon the plan of the built structure. The chapter on temples is of even less help, since it does not even mention the diagrams. It does contain a clas- sification of temples on the basis of their shape, such as garuda (hawk), simha (lion), or padma (lotus). But none of these shapes bear a formal correspondence with the square Vastupurusamandala. All this is significant because several scholars refer to Brhatsamhita precisely as the text that illus- trates the use of mandalas particularly with respect to house plans.60 In reality, however, the only place where the author of Brhatsamhita discusses the issue is in verses 71 to 75.61 Here, he points out the effects on the house and its occu- pants of locating doors in the parts of the house occupied by various deities. All that this implies, though, is that differ- ent areas of the house are identified according to the pre- siding deities of that area; in other words, a latent Vastupurusamandala is assumed as being coterminous with the house. There is no direct evidence for such a mandala actually being used as a grid for planning the residence. Those who cite the Brhatsamhita as a source of evi- dence for the governing role of the mandala do not draw an adequate distinction between the two separate views of the mandala-the mandala as an iconic device recording the relative location of deities, and the mandala as a generative or design tool. Evidence pointing to the one is interpreted as evidence for the other. It is quite possible, however, that the plan of any given building may be read as being coex- tensive with the mandala, without it having been designed using the mandala, or even conforming to its shape. An even greater challenge to the idea of a governing mandala comes through the evidence from practice. If we were to accept that the mandala was typically used as a design tool, then actual built examples must show evidence of planning based on the mandala. However, scholars have found it extremely difficult to relate forms of existing his- torical buildings to the Vastupurusaman.dalas, except in a cursory or schematic manner. A good illustration of this is an attempt made by Alice Boner. In a 1975 article discussing the contents of Silpasarini- an Orissan treatise on the construction and description of D L Figure 8 Boner's drawing of a Mahaprasasta Pancaratha type of tem- ple superstructure from its description in the Silpasarini temples-Boner shows how well-known historical examples such as the Padma Kesara Deula at Konark correspond closely to the sastric prescriptions.62 For instance, she relates the dimensions of the temple superstructure, both in plan and section, to a measuring scheme based upon a triplet of modules (mulasutra) indicated in Silpasarini, a vdstu manual from the region (Figure 8). However, when she tries to account for the presence of the three yantras depicted within the measured plans of these temples in documents from the seventeenth century, she is forced to admit that the text is not very informative (Figure 9).63 She suggests that a correspondence exists between the mandala diagrams and each of the plans of the sanctum and the outer pavilions; but this is sketchy at best. For example, nothing of the elab- orate layering of the Saurabhadrayantra, drawn within the sanctum plan, can be traced to the actual structure of the sanctum. The only correspondence is that between the 38 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000 F-</page><page sequence="14">Figure 9 Boner's reconstruction of the yantras indicated within the plans of the Parama Surya temple at Konark square outline and the four parsvadevatds (the major sup- porting deities) of the yantra, which are placed in niches on the outside walls of the sanctum. Correspondence is simi- larly vague in the case of the plan of the mukhasal (the mid- dle pavilion) and the Saurapancabjaman.dala underlying it. One may match the four lotuses drawn within the corners of the mandala to the four columns that support the mukhasala, but beyond that, nothing of the actual architec- tural detail necessary to the mandala can be discerned within the plan. Boner points out how some of the deities placed around the periphery of the pavilion correspond to the positions marked on the mandalas, yet not all the deities of the mandala can be identified in the mukhasald. The most fundamental disagreement, however, is metrical; the man- dala is drawn is upon a grid of 5 x 5 squares, while the mukhasald, in accordance with the method described in Sil- pasdrini, is constructed upon a grid of 12 x 12 modules. Very little, besides obvious gross details, is found in the descrip- tion or in the use of the mandala to have a bearing upon the rich architectural form. Michael Meister is another scholar who has explored this issue at length, maintaining that mandala was used to found the temple "not just ritually, but as an architectural mecha- nism used to plan and proportion the ... monument."64 In a series of studies, he has carefully measured plans of several Hindu temples (and in a few cases, the elevations) and sub- jected them to detailed geometrical analysis.65 Several of Meister's geometrical exercises have been designed to show that even the complex outlines of temple superstructures can be constructed upon square grids. In general, this argument seems to bear out quite well, and a number of temples show signs of having been designed upon an orthogonal grid around square sanctum chambers. This is not always the case, however. A good example are the "stellate" plans discussed by Meister in a 1982 paper, in which the exterior forms of the sanctum chambers appear to be based on rotations of squares and cannot obviously have been derived directly from the orthogonal grid of the vdstu diagrams.66 To resolve this, Meister proposes that two different geometries were used for dimensioning the temple plans. While the square interior of the sanctums was based on the simple orthogonal grid of the Vastumandala, the exterior was composed using what he calls the "geometry of the sulva-sutras," based on "peg-and-string" constructions.67 For all its ingenuity, this is a somewhat puzzling argu- ment. There are no indications within the literature on the history of Indian mathematics, or within vastusastra texts, that there were two separate techniques of geometrical con- structions prevalent at any time. Rather, some silpa manu- als specifically record peg-and-string operations to ensure a precisely oriented construction of the square perimeter of the Vastupurusamandala itself. Diagonals appear, further- more, within the drawing of the Vdstupurusamandalas, indi- cating that strict use of orthogonal lines was never a criterion for the construction of the Vastumandala. Clearly, an a priori acceptance of the idea that the square interior of the sanctums can only derive from the strictly orthogonal grid of the Vastuman.dala forces Meister to propose an alter- native geometry for the exterior, where orthogonality is inadequate to explain the form. It would, perhaps, be sim- pler to accept that a single geometrical matrix underlies the superstructures of these temples and generates both the orthogonal interiors of their sanctums as well as their stel- late exteriors. But if so, the ritual significance of such a geo- metrical grid (and its symbolization of the Vdstupurusa) would come into question. After all, the Vastuman.dala dia- gram must be cardinally oriented to be efficacious.

There is one case where Meister is able to make a per- suasive argument for a lurking, almost imperceptible, pres- ence of the Vdstuman.dala within the plan of a temple. The temple in question is a seventh-century shrine to Siva at Mundesvari in Bihar.68 It has an atypical octagonal sanctum, both in the interior as well as the exterior, and neither the 8 x 8 grid (generally prescribed for temples) nor the 9 x 9 grid (prescribed for towns and palaces) is able to account for the size and proportions of the temple (Figure 10).69 But though the Vdstumandala does not appear as the generative grid of the temple, its presence is felt within a different con- text. A careful investigation leads Meister to the observa- tion that the outer octagon deviates slightly from a perfect figure, so that the diagonal sides are slightly smaller than the orthogonal ones. Meister argues that the deviation could be attributed only to a careful avoidance of the mar- mas on the plan of temple, identified upon an underlying Vdstupurusaman.dala. Since the many vastu texts do not spec- ify unequivocally where on the square plan the marmas should fall, there is no textual verification possible for Meis- ter's argument.70 However, given the general precision in the construction of the plan, the tiny deviation of 10 cen- timeters in sides measuring around 5 meters is undoubtedly deliberate (Figure 11). If so, Meister's argument seems to provide the best explanation. The Theory of the "Ritual Grid" So many existing temple superstructures seem to deviate from the generative model of the Vdstupurusaman.dala, that Kramrisch herself was forced to admit that the Vds- tupurusaman.dala was merely an idealized model, more ignored than followed in the design of major temples: When the Vastupurusamandala is drawn on the square floor of the Prasada to be built the number of its squares is also that of 40 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000 cM A /yak L ' dhara iatsa I jayali :a r A) J 21 Indra Indra Vivasvan Indra -Sury Satva Savit 0 --il va a) 0- L I _ am I- A . _ shmar rm</page><page sequence="16">Figure 11 Siva temple, Mundesvari.

He has elucidated this not sc detailed studies of individual plans as with ( morphological studies of a broad sample of ter According to Meister, these plans indicate a cc of an 8 x 8 grid, showing, in effect Vastupurusamandala continued to exert its influence in the form of a "ritual grid" whose origins he traces back to the construction of Vedic altars.74 The only difference is that in the later temples, the designers-the sthapatis and the mas- ter masons-seem to have evolved ingenious ways of over- coming its restrictions, particularly its constraining orthogonality. He points out, for instance, that from the seventh century onward, the external corners of many tem- ples are recessed from their usual position at the outer cor- ners of the regulating grid, although the projections on the center of the faces continue to align themselves with the grid. This "recession of corners" seems to give some lee- way to the designers by allowing them to vary the thickness and position of walls-and, in effect, the dimensions of the plan-while still maintaining an alignment with the grid. The idea of a flexible "ritual grid" also helps to account for the design of stellate plans, whose nonorthogonal pro- file Meister tried to explain away by proposing an alterna- tive "peg-and-string" geometry. If the grid itself is taken to =1 I10 c be of ritual significance, then it could be rotated as desired without disturbing its symbolic, protective aura. of an enlarged In short, by using the idea of the Vastupurusamandala to and y) from explain the variation in the Hindu temple form, Meister effectively reduces the Vdstupurusamandala to its grid. In order for the grid to be effective as a tool and to admit for- mal experimentation, however, Meister gives a subtle inter- is however is pretation to its use and significance.

As Meister's argument is sophisticated and persuasive: the lilt, after the grid is only a regulative tool and the very act of embedding g of the Vas- it is auspicious. There is, therefore, a great deal of flexibil- rite without ity in its use; the grid can be rotated, and elements of the the ground design can be shifted from it. But, in formulating this idea, he seems to have moved a good deal away from the strict he deviation orientation and hierarchy of the Vdstupurusamandala.

A Critique of the Theory of the Governing Mandala: Some Questionable Premises Not only was the idea of the governing mandala, then, a constructed idea, but it also seems to have been promoted in the face of a troubling lack of corroborating evidence from surviving built structures. What made it possible to sustain this argument, and even more, to popularize it? Carl Hempel had once written that there is a tendency within science to support theories far beyond their evidential basis, provided they offer a simple and neat model that systemat- ically orders a mass of disparate factual data; a similar process seems to have operated here.77 The interpretative, or iconographical, turn that Indian art history had taken in the early years of this century was founded essentially on the idea of a constant, almost immutable, philosophical ground underlying all Hindu artistic production. For schol- ars such as Coomaraswamy and Kramrisch, the role of iconographical analysis was to reconstruct the original philosophical roots from which the various artistic forms had emerged.78 The notion of a geometrical device with symbolic dimensions underlying all architectural produc- tion through the ages very naturally fitted such a paradigm. Since the idea of the all-governing mandala was a premise of the theory rather than an idea to be proved through it, evidence had to be interpreted selectively to support it. Once the premise is brought into question, however, it becomes possible to interpret the available evidence differ- ently. For analytical purposes, it is useful to restructure all this evidence into three broad categories: evidence from texts that refers directly to the Vastupurusamandala, indirect evi- dence referring to specific aspects of the mandala (particu- larly the square grid), and evidence that refers to other diagrams only tangentially related to the Vastupurusaman.dala. 1. Direct Evidence from Texts and Practice The first point to emerge, when the idea of the generative mandala is questioned, is that this notion subsumes three different ways in which the mandala is typically held to influence the built form. This is important, because direct evidence on this matter supports these three roles of the mandala to varying degrees. The first kind of role that the theory accords to the Vastupurusamandala is organizational: the grid of the Vas- tupurusaman.dala is held to order the distribution of pro- grammatic elements over a built site or an individual build- ing. The premise here is that the Vastupurusamandala mod- els the site (or in the case of individual building, its ground plan) and can be seen as a schematic representation of it. Thus, different areas of the site acquire different associa- tions by their correspondence with the different squares of the Vdstupurusamandala grid. This, in turn, dictates such decisions as the layout of functions over a site or the orga- nization of iconographical material over the surface of a building. At first glance, this aspect of the mandala seems to be best supported by available evidence. As discussed earlier, texts such as Mayamatam are explicit in their injunctions regarding the use of particular mandalas in laying out the plans of temple complexes. But it is also common for writ- ers to see the evidence of an underlying mandala in the typ- ical features of traditional city layouts-the location of the palace in the center, or the presence of residential quarters belonging to specific castes. Such conclusions are a bit too facile. Even if there is a match between the location of par- ticular deities in a mandala and the location of particular programmatic elements on the actual site, it does not imme- diately follow that the mandala was used to organize the site; it is quite as possible that a common spatial scheme organized the layout of both the mandala and the site. It is also worth noting that the impact of the Vdstupurusaman- dala, as far as its organizational role goes, may not at all be formal. The zoning produced by the use of the square grid may determine the programmatic layout of a site or build- ing, not the forms of structures constructed upon it. We have already noted that scholars such as Dutt found it con- venient to differentiate between folk planning and site plan- ning, and argued that the mandalas were more influential in determining the former than the latter.79 Another role popularly assigned to the mandala is reg- ulatory; the grid lines upon which the mandala is drawn con- strain the superimposed built structure. In more crude versions of this idea, the mandala restricts the plan of the built structure to an orthogonal, grid-like form. But, in the more sophisticated versions, the role of the mandala is far more subtle. As we have seen, a few vital lines and points (marmas) are identified on the Vdstumandala and act as loca- tions where building is to be altogether avoided. Let us take the latter case first. There is good reason to believe that a mandala that is coextensive with the plan may influence several aspects of the built form. The role of the Vastupurusamandala, however, is somewhat negative here; rather than suggesting a specific form, the Vdstupurusaman- dala acts as a constraining device, either restricting the final form of the building, or causing minor distortions in it. 42 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="18">Interestingly, theoretical sources are not unequivocal on how this is to be achieved in practice. Various sources reveal a variety of methods, from leaving gaps in walls wherever they cross over a diagonal of a Vdstupurusamandala overlaid on the site, to shifting entire walls so that they avoid the mar- mas. In addition to this, the very location of the marmas on the body of the Vdstupurusa is matter of contention. Typi- cally, the vital lines (sirds) upon which the marmas are located do not occur along the grid of the Vastupurusamandala, but diagonally, along the body of the Vdstupurusa. Kramrisch offers a revealing comparative table that lists the different locations of the marmas described in various texts.80 Evidence for the first case, however, is much more uncertain. Statements about concentric square enclosures in temple complexes in texts like the Mayamatam, and built examples such as the persistently square interior of temple sanctums provide the best arguments to support the idea that the mandala is used to constrain built form to orthog- onal or grid-like forms. But there is enough variation, both in traditional built form and in described form, to seriously challenge the idea. As we have seen, Meister's theory of the ritual grid seems to be the most coherent answer to this; but this accords the mandala a role that exceeds its charge as a regulatory device and brings it closer to its third role, that of a generative diagram. According to the generative role of the mandala, the square grid of the Vastupurusamandala is believed to pro- vide a metric that governs the shapes, dimensions, and pro- portions of built forms. This is undoubtedly the most significant role accorded to the Vdstupurusamandala, since it is given the status of a truly genetic diagram-an encoded general blueprint with parameters that may be varied to generate any kind of built form. It is in this case that the evidence appears to be the most problematic. For one, direct evidence, either in the form of explicit instructions explaining how a mandala may be read for measures, proportions, and layout of structures, or in the form of existing structures, is, in actuality, notable by its absence. Instead, the evidence that mainly refers to the orga- nizational and regulatory use of the Vdstupurusaman.dala has been adapted to serve the theory of the generative mandala. Since the theory of the architectural use of the mandala includes its organizational, regulative, and generative roles within a unified conception, it is generally accepted that any sign of the first two implies that a generative Vdstumandala underlies the structure in question. The essential argument for the generative mandala, however, comes from indirect evidence, almost all of which is predicated on the assumption that the generative power of the mandala lies within its grid. 2. The Evidence of the Grid Most demonstrations of the generative mandala-Meister's theory of the ritual grid is a good example-are based upon the idea of the overlaying of a grid (preferably the 8 x 8 grid of the Vdstupurusaman.dala) on a plan and the matching up of its elements with those of the plan. The reasoning behind this procedure follows from two premises: (1) if a grid can be successfully matched with the parts of a built form, it must have been used as a design tool; and (2) the presence of a grid is a strong sign of the mandala, and in the pres- ence of ancilliary evidence, such as the presence of the dik- pala images in correctly oriented niches, it is a virtual proof for the presence of an underlying Vastupurusaman.dala. But both these premises, as discussed below, have a considerable potential for doubt. The Grid as a Generative Tool Indian architecture is replete with plans-of towns, temple complexes, houses, shrine chambers-upon which orthog- onal grids of various sizes can easily be made to fit. It is quite possible, however, that such forms may result from the employment of a modular proportioning and dimensioning system rather than the actual use of a grid. In fact, so far as evidence from vastusastra goes, the employment of a mod- ular system may be even more likely. From Boner's account we see how three sets of modules are used in the planning of Orissan temples. A similar approach, which Kramrisch describes, has also been mentioned.81 It is important to note that in both these descriptions, the operational procedures appear to construct centerlines or boundaries and to delin- eate the unit modules upon these. Such a system is different in principle from one in which an orthogonal grid is drawn and the features of plans and elevations placed with refer- ence to it. Practically speaking, a grid is a cumbersome and complicated tool for the laying out of plans; it is extremely susceptible to errors unless checked by diagonals, and does not provide the required precision unless specified with very small divisions, or accompanied by a great deal of con- structive scaffolding. In contrast, the centerline system that is frequently described within vdstu manuals is a far more direct, simple, and accurate tool. Such a centerline system is still used by traditional craftsmen in Kerala to compute the proportions of statues.82 This is not to suggest that grids were never employed as planning or design tools, but simply that their use was, in all likelihood, related to a specific task-that of zoning. A good place to note this distinction is in the Vdstusutra Upanisad.83 This highly original text outlines the method of composing paintings and relief panels, accompanied by a rare discussion on the symbolism of diagrammatic devices ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 43</page><page sequence="19">that are employed to organize the composition. One such diagrammatic device is in the form of a 4 x 4 orthogonal grid called khilapanjara (literally, a linear skeleton). The khi- lapanjara is used to divide the panel on which the image (either a painting or a relief) is drawn into sixteen parts within which different deities are placed, a procedure that has some affinity with that of the drawing of the Vastuman- dala. As the text itself reads: The hole in the center, [it is to be] considered as a Brahman. The compartments in the measure of the sixteenfold grid are known to be of five types: the field of Brahman, of the gods (daiva), of living beings (jaiva), of secondary divinities (updaiva), and of worshippers (stuvaka).84 Although on one level this description recalls the Vds- tupurusamandala, the khilapanjara is indeed a different entity. There are no deities associated with it, except for the subject matter depicted on the composition. The panel is not stringently required to be square, and although the cen- tral squares are devoted to the major deities, the scheme of division recognizes positions in terms of lower and upper sections as well as those to the right and left. In addition to the khilapanjara, the text also describes several diagrams that may be constructed as an armature upon which the compo- sition may be planned. These diagrams are not orthogonal grids but rather geometric constructions involving squares, triangles, and circles. The text prescribes how the limbs of the beings represented within are to be placed in relation to this armature.85 Clearly, there is a distinction of use between the orthogonal grid (khilapanjara) and the geometrically con- structed armatures. The khilapanjara is simply used to roughly mark off certain zones within which different cat- egories of deities can be depicted, while the other diagrams are explicitly utilized to determine lines of composition. Besides this distinction, two other characterstics of these diagrams need to be noted. First, these diagrams are more or less practical devices; they were not used to repre- sent, or symbolize, any larger idea that underlay the artwork beyond its subject matter. Second, not one but several dif- ferent diagrams could be used as aids for a single composi- tion. In other words, the fact that these diagrams were used to compose paintings or relief panels does not give the dia- grams a symbolic or representational charge. Whatever symbolic value the composed artwork possesses is derived from the subject matter, not from the deployment of par- ticular diagrams. The example of the khilapanjara, of course, does not prove that the use of the mandala grids in buildings had a similar role. Still, it does provide a precedence for the prac- tical use of diagrammatic devices and therefore makes prob- lematic any unverified claim that the sign of a geometrical construction or a diagrammatic device within a composi- tion is an indicator of some special symbolism associated with the composition. The Mandala as a Grid It is common nowadays to translate the term mandala as a diagram. The term has even found its way into ordinary English usage as implying "any of various ritualistic geo- metric designs symbolic of the universe, used in Hinduism and Buddhism as an aid to meditation."86 Such a meaning is widely accepted even within more scholarly writing. In a glossary at the end of her translation of the Vastusutra Upanisad, Alice Boner describes the term as meaning "a cir- cle, diagram, any circular circumscribed area, but also used for square yantras."87 Within its typical Sanskrit usage, however, the term mandala is considerably more polysemic. The Sanskrit- English dictionary of Monier-Williams records the follow- ing meanings of the term: circular, round, globe, orb, ring, halo (according to the Brhatsamhita); also, territory, province, country, the circle of king's friends, a multitude, group, band, collection, whole body, society, company (according to usage in Mahabharata and Yajnavalkaya). One of the oldest instances of the term appears in the R.g Veda, where it is applied to denote the major subdivisions (chap- ters) of the text. Presumably, the term refers to the "group" of slokas (verses) that were gathered together within the chapter. Kautilya's Arthasastra uses the term in another very peculiar sense-to model certain political situations for any given prince. The prince is placed at the center of a scheme called the rdjamandala. All the neighbors immediately sur- rounding the central kingdom are taken as enemies, and all the neighbors who are in proximity to this ring (that is, forming another circle) are taken as enemies of the king- doms on the inner ring, and by implication, taken to be friends of the king. The overall conception visualizes a com- plex concentric arrangement, formed by alternating rings of friends and enemies. This use of the term is similar to the one found in the epics. In the Mahabharata, the term is used to imply a group of friends-a use that, incidentally, has persisted into modern Indian languages such as Hindi and Gujarati. In none of the above usages of the term is the mandala considered to be a specific geometrical diagram. The closest occurrence of this term as a reference to any kind of a geometric entity is found in the Sulva Sutras, where it is used to refer to the figure of the circle. Apart from this, the mandala as a diagram or a pictorial device is 44 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="20">almost exclusively confined to Tantric literature, where, as we have seen, it is used in the context of a specific medita- tional practice. In the case of the Vastupurusaman.dala, it is, perhaps, more accurate to reserve the term mandala for the group of deities arranged concentrically upon the body of the Vds- tupurusa. The square grid would then be simply an instru- ment-a yantra-used for the coded depiction of the vastu deities. Although the legend of the Vastupurusa and the deities occupying his body has its origins in Brahmanical texts, the earliest writings that mention it-the Brhatsamhita and the Puranas-are dated to around the middle of the first millennium. It is precisely during this time that a resurgent Hindu religion, reformulating its traditions from its Bra- hamanical roots, is said to have come under an extensive influence of Tantricism.88 Given this, it does not stretch matters to see the grid, or yantra, as a Tantric element incorporated into the conception of the Vastuman.dala dur- ing the resurgence of Hinduism in India. What this implies is that the grid itself may not be the key idea within the con- ception of the Vastumandala. From discussions above, we know that the essential structure of the mandala is concen- tric and that the grid as such does not feature itself within a reading of the mandala. The grid, moreover, may even serve to hide the true structure of the mandala. This distinction between the diagrammatic grid and the set of deities that constitute the mandala gains even fur- ther meaning on two counts. First, it seems to accord quite well with the makeshift manner in which the deities are located within the grid. Since the forty-five deities cannot be placed each to a cell within any of the grids, this requires an allotment of two or more cells to particular deities. Fur- thermore, the forty-four deities surrounding the central deity are divided into four groups, each of which is assigned to a cardinal direction. In order to assign these deities to individual cells, it is first necessary to partition the cells of the square grid into four groups, each to be associated with one side of the outer square. This creates yet another prob- lem, since the sides of the Vdstupurusamandala are already oriented to the cardinal directions. The lines partitioning the diagram into four symmetrical components would therefore fall along the diagonals of the square rather than along the orthogonal lines of the grid, splitting the cells lying on the diagonal axes into two. This problem is tack- led differently in different texts; in each case, the cells occu- pied by the deities vary not only in size but also in shape-from oblong rectangular to square to triangular. From this, it seems quite reasonable to presume that the idea of the square grids with their square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and so on) developed independently of the idea of the Vdstumandala with its forty-five deities. Second, this distinction also accounts for the differences in the treatment of the topic ofpadavinyas from texts of dif- ferent architectural traditions. It has been noted, for instance, that the southern texts, such as Mayamatam and Manasara, were the only ones to feature a complete sequence of square grids associated with the Vastupurusaman.dala.89 Further, it is also largely these texts that explicitly advocate the use of the grids for planning layouts. In comparison, only the 64- and 81-squared versions of the Vastupurusaman.dala are discussed within the vastusastric literature from western India, and even then it is limited to the issue of identifying the marnas. It is possible that once the association between the set of deities of the vastu and the diagrammatic device was made, different architectural traditions elaborated and modified it in different ways. The southern schools, perhaps already relying on a building tradition employing orthogo- nal grids, found it easy to incorporate the Vastupurusaman- dala as a conceptualization of the planning grid, while the western schools allocated a more restricted role to it. To summarize, the grid is neither an effective generative tool, not is it central, from a formal perspective, to the idea of the Vastupurusamandala. In other words, signs of orthog- onality in buildings need not imply a grid, and evidence of a grid being employed need not imply a mandala; any evidence that aims to establish conclusively the use of a mandala as a design tool must, therefore, be much more direct. 3. Evidence of the Yantras A final piece of evidence pointing to a generative role of the mandala remains as yet unexplained: the yantras embedded within the traditional drawings of temple plans. What are we to make of these? Clearly, these are not Vastupurusaman- dalas and have no connection to the traditional theory of building. Still, these mandalas are not only drawn directly within the plans, but they also seem to bear an undeniable relationship with the superstructures. Were they not the basis of the design for the plan and elevation of the man- dala? If not, how can their presence within temple plans be accounted for? The most plausible explanation is that the superstruc- tures surmounting these diagrams are a three-dimensional manifestation of the mandalas. In other words, the temples were built deliberately as mandalas. This is by no means an original proposition. As far back as the 1940s, Zimmer argued that mandalas drawn upon paper were just one man- ifestation of the device, and that for an initiate an iconic image or an entire building could serve as a mandala just as well. He proposed that the pyramidal structure of the well- ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 45</page><page sequence="21">known temple of Borobudur was itself a vast mandala, allowing the initiates moving within it to practice medita- tion in much the same way as they would sitting down in front of a drawn one. Of late, several scholars have pre- sented strong evidence in support of the view that Buddhist caves, Hindu shrines, and even sculptures embody specific yantras or mandalas. John Huntington, for instance, shows how a set of caves at Ellora can be ascribed to a rare Indian Tantrayana sect, by showing how their iconography and structure corresponds to two mandalas-Vajradhattumandala and Mahakarunadhatumandala.90 In another interesting paper, Devangana Desai has suggested that the erotic sculp- tures of Khajuraho were essentially yantras given a provoca- tive iconography to distract the noninitiated observer.91 And recently, Bettina Baumer presented a convincing analysis of a yet unattributed Orissan temple, known locally as the Rajarani temple, identifying it as a Devi temple-a type of temple that, according to local texts, was supposed to be constructed literally as a mandala.92 All these arguments are quite different from the claim that the mandala (the Vastupurusaman.dala, in particular) was the key to generating the forms of built structures. In these cases, temples and other structures were constructed, not so much from formal information decoded from the man- dala, but simply as three-dimensional versions of them, and, more significantly, as forms that serve to hide the actual embedded mandalas. In other words, the form of these structures was not supposed to be derived from these man- dalas. The only requirement was that they provide points of correspondence with the underlying mandala, so that an ini- tiate could mentally reconstruct the mandala otherwise hid- den from view. The mandala itself carried no information about the architecture of the superstructure. Here, instead of the mandala encoding information about the superstruc- ture, it is the architectural forms that encode information about the mandalas. The mandalas remain what they are- meditational aids. Conclusion: The Historical Diagram What remains, then, of the idea of the Vdstupurusamandala? Clearly, some modifications are required in the way it is cur- rently conceptualized. While we do not yet have a sufficient basis for a full-fledged theory of the mandala-evidence from modern versions of traditional practice is one signifi- cant omission in this essay-it is possible, at least, to suggest a potential outline of one. The most useful point of departure is to recognize the conceptual separation of the Vastupurusamandala from the grid within which it is usually inscribed. The Vatstupurusaman- dala simply appears as the body of the Vastupurusa, with which is associated a host, or mandala, of deities. If it needs at all to be described diagrammatically, the simplest way of describing it is as a hierarchically organized concentric structure, further articulated by a cardinally oriented radial segmentation. It is in this form that the Vastupurusamandala is understood to be associated with traditional built forms, the essential point of association being the assignation of relative merit, or auspi- ciousness, to different parts of built structures. The topolog- ical flexibility that is inbuilt within this diagram allows the Vastupurusamandala to act as an organizing and regulating guide, without giving it the additional onus of determining the dimensions of the built form. The grid, from this point of view, plays no part in the functioning of the Vastupurusamandala-even the sensitive regulating lines and points (marmas) are more consistently defined directly upon the body of the Vastupurusa, rather than the on the grid. This may raise immediate objections. After all, it cannot be denied that the Vastupurusamandala is invariably defined upon a grid; if nothing more, the term padadevatas, the collective name given to the outer divinities arranged upon it, reflects this. Furthermore, there is the direct evidence that explicitly links the grid with the Vas- tupurusamandala. How can all this evidence be accounted for? And, what, to be more precise, is the relationship between the grid and Vastupurusaman.dala? To begin with, the grid serves as a useful device for the Vastupurusaman.dala. The purpose of the grid in this sense is twofold: first, to give a rigid "structure" to the looser, more flexible, anthropomorphic conception of the Vas- tupurusamandala; and, second, almost paradoxically, to "hide" this structure from the inauspicious eyes of the uninitiated. Together, these two uses give the Vastupu- rusamandala a sufficiently precise and guarded form that can be used for meditational or oblatory rituals. But, at the same time, the built structure itself can also perform this role- buildings can both provide a structure for an embedded man- dala, and also serve to hide it. In other words, the grid acts in place of the building, rather than serving as the basis of it. Conversely, the Vastupurusaman.dala may be used to sanctify a grid and guard it from evil influences, much in the same way that it sanctifies a built structure. Such a use of the Vastupurusamandala is, to my mind, a relatively late development, one that was largely favored among the southern schools of architecture. It is in the Mayamatam and the Manasara that a comprehensive list of padavinyas diagrams first appears, and it is also in these (as well as in the Agamic texts) that suggestions regarding the organizational use of these diagrams can be found. Given this, it is quite possible that the tradition of using grids to organize and 46 JSAH / 59:1, MARCH 2000</page><page sequence="22">schematically lay out sites, buildings, and complexes in the south may have an independent lineage apart from that of the conception of the Vdstupurusaman.dala. However con- jectural, such an idea does account for some of the differ- ences between the southern and northern texts, as well as the predominance of grid-like arrangements in the southern tradition-both in theory as well as practice. The theory of the Vastupurusaman.dala would have been a welcome graft onto the traditional southern idea of the grid. Admittedly, the revised notion of the Vdstupurusaman- dala that I have proposed does appear somewhat ad hoc; it lacks the neatness of Kramrisch's idea of a unified, all-per- vasive entity that had generative, organizational, and regu- latory powers. Still, it has its virtues of(1) providing a better accountability of the available evidence, and (2) lending his- torical depth to the idea of the Vdstupurusamandala. For, ultimately, if any idea related to the current conception of the Vdstupurusaman.dala needs to be sorely challenged, it is the notion of a single, conceptually pure entity that has per- sisted unchanged through the development of architecture in the subcontinent. Instead, it would be far more useful and insightful to look upon the Vdstupurusamandala as an idea that has been constantly redefined and exploited through history, and what we have made of it now is merely a recently constructed understanding. Notes I would like to thank Dr. Ronald Lewcock and Dr. Raymond Allchin, whose criticism helped shape the arguments presented here. Aarati Kanekar con- tributed extensively to the initial research, and Sudha Shah to the final edit- ing of the document. 1. A prominent case is the eighteenth-century city of Jaipur, where a rare regular gridiron planning of its roads is often taken to imply an underlying mandala, which imparts a cosmic sense to its conceptualization. See Carmen Kargal, ed., Vistara: The Architecture of India (New Delhi, 1986), and Satish Davar, "A filigree city spun out of nothingness," Marg 30, no. 4 (1977): 35-58. G.H.R. Tillotson, The Rajput Palaces (New Haven, 1987), and Christopher Tadgell, History of Architecture in India (London, 1991), also appear to endorse this view, though without citing much evidence. For a more balanced view, see A. Roy, "The Dream and the Plan," Marg 30, no. 4 (1977): 25-26. 2. The discussions in Tillotson, Rajput Palaces, 80-84, and Andreas Vol- wahsen, LivingArchitecture-Indian (New York, 1969), 50-57, are good illus- trations of the problems of relating the mandala to actual building plans. "It is not difficult to find the geometric key to the ground plan. But when it is a matter of interpreting the esoteric content of these graphic constructions, we are reduced to conjectures," writes Volwahsen (55). Similarly, Tillotson admits that "in the Bundelkhand palaces, this prescription, the fundamen- tal point of mandala planning, is totally ignored" (83, original italics). 3. The term vastu traditionally refers to both the habitable site as well as the "spirit" associated with it; silpa specifically means sculpture, but is also used for arts in general; sastra is used in the sense of a practical body of knowledge. 4. Much of the material on vdstusastra still remains to be translated and cat- alogued, but some efforts have been made to summarize the basic texts. A very comprehensive listing of Sanskrit texts relevant to vastusastra can be found in Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple (Calcutta, 1946), 437-442. Alice Boner, Sadashiva Rath Sharma, and Bettina Baumer, Vdstusutra Upanisad (Delhi, 1986), and Bruno Dagens, trans., Mayamatam (Delhi, 1994), also give good comprehensive summaries of the vastusastric litera- ture, with Dagens's review being particularly valuable as it is fairly recent. Another very useful, but somewhat tendentious, survey is given in Deven- dra Nath Shukla, Vastushastra: Hindu Science of Architecture (New Delhi, 1995; rep. of 1960 ed.), 67-85. Tarapada Bhattacharya's important review, A Study on Vastuvidya or Canons of Indian Architecture (Patna, 1947), was brought to my notice by my anonymous reviewer. 5. Many of these are as technical and detailed in their discussion on vastu and silpa as any of the "technical treatises." In the Kamikdgama, for instance, sixty out of seventy-five chapters are devoted to these topics. 6. Dagens, trans., Mayamatam, xli. 7. A recent case is that of the Vdstusutra Upanisad, a recently discovered text which claims to be related to the Atharvaveda. But given its colloquial and, at times, faulty language, and the fact that traditions of figural art that it describes did not develop until much later, this claim does not have much standing. See Bhattacharya, "The position of the Vastusutropanishad," in Boner et al., Vastusutra Upanisad, 30-36. 8. Chaps. 258-270 onpratima laksanam and vastu were added to Matsyapu- rana around A.D. 550-650 and chaps. 252-257 around A.D. 650-1000. Chaps. 21-106, 263-272, and 317-326 of the Agnipurana were all added after the ninth century. See R. C. Hazra, Studies in the Puranic Records on the Hindu Rites and Customs (New Delhi, 1987), 176. 9. The date of the Arthasdstra is a matter of much contention, with dates ranging from late fourth century (B. Keith, History of Sanskrit Literature [Oxford, 1928], 452-462, on linguistic grounds), to as early as third cen- tury B.C. (Dr. F. R. Allchin in a personal communication, on the basis of its descriptive content). However, Thomas Trautmann's argument that the text had multiple authorship and was compiled in its final form about the third century, seems to be the most satisfactory. See Trautmann, Kautilya and the ArthasIstra: A statistical investigation of the authorship and the evolution of the text (Leiden, 1971). I would like to thank my anonymous reviewer for this information. 10. According to Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, 5, the sixth century Brhatsamhita is the earliest existing and datable text that deals with vastusistra, followed by the Visnudharmottara of the seventh century. 11. Shukla, Vastushastra, 25-26. 12. Dagens, trans., Mayamatam, xli. 13. Although dating of most Tantric texts is still a matter of debate, it is generally accepted that the South Indian Agamic texts (including the Saivagmas that are such rich sources of architectural writings) are a uni- formly late production, dating mostly from the later half of the first mil- lennium A.D.

ON THE IDEA OF THE MANDALA AS A GOVERNING DEVICE 47</page><page sequence="23">19. The reading of the two texts, which contain very similar material, has fluctuated considerably over time. Since Ram Raz's Essay on the Architecture of the Hindoos (London, 1834), Manasara was held to be the representative vastusastra treatise, at any rate the most complete one available. According to Acharya, Mayamatam was a later copy of Manasara. More recently, Dagens (Mayamatam, xliv-xlv) has argued that the current version of the Manasara is very recent although based on an earlier, incomplete work that may come from the same tradition as the Mayamtam. 20.

Most Vedic literature does not adequately distinguish between squares and other quadrilaterals-the only difference being the technical literature on con- structive geometry in the various Sulvasutras. There, the square is accorded no more significance than the other geometrical figures-rectangle, trian- gle, circle, and trapezium-that were used in the construction of altars. 34. What these "aspects" are, Kramrisch fails to clarify. The Adityas are actually interpreted slightly differently within Vedic literature. See n. 38. 35. For a convenient discussion on this, see Alain Danielou, Hindu Polythe- ism (New York, 1964), 79-138. For an example of original material, see the accounting of the number and types of gods recorded in the Brhadaryanaka Upanishad 3.9.1-9. 36. Danielou, Hindu Polytheism, 233f. 37. There have been attempts to interpret these padadevatas as manifesta- tions of other regular deities (see Vibhuti Chakrabarti, Indian Architectural Theory [Richmond, Surrey, 1998], 63-86), but it is doubtful whether such assignations are of any significant antiquity. 38. The Adityas, originally six in number (Rg Veda, 2.27.1), were initially identified with the fundamental principles that structured human society, and only in the Brahmanical and later literature acquired their astronomi- cal association. See Danielou, Hindu Polytheism, 112-127, for a compara- tive discusion. The attempt to link the padadevatas to the nakiatras is made in Visnudharmottara Purana, 29.18-30.

It is not possible to define Tantric literature unambiguously since sev- eral schools, sects, or literary traditions, includingJainism, Buddhism, Saiv- Siddhanta, and Pancratra draw heavily upon elements of "Tantricism." Most of what can be identified exclusively as Tantric literature includes two major subdivisions-the Saiva tantras from the north and the slightly later Agamic literature from the south.

Shelby (46-61) challenges the notion of the "masons' secret," claiming that the medieval lodges did not have the orga- nizational structure to preserve such a trade secret, but this idea seems to have been well accepted during the forties and fifties. 49. Frankl, "The secret of the medieval masons," 46. 50. I have not been able to find a direct evidence for such a claim, and, so far as I can ascertain, no one has explicitly proposed a connection between the geometrical methods of the master masons and the use of Vastupurusamandala. However, the similarity between Indian (or Oriental) art and the medieval art of Europe was a key theme in the interpretive stud- ies of Indian art history of the early twentieth century, and historians of Indian art were quite aware of scholarship on medieval art and even con- tributed to it. See Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, "The Philosophy of Medieval and Oriental Art," Zalmoxis 1 (1938), reprinted in A. K. Coomaraswamy, Coomaraswamy: Traditional Art and Symbolism, ed. R. Lipsey (Princeton, 1977), 43-70. 51. Most early translators and scholars trying to locate and interpret tradi- tional manuals complained about the secrecy and closed-mindedness with which such texts were guarded by the families and guilds of craftsmen. See, for instance, letters from Ram Raz to his sponsor P. Clarke (dated 13 Octo- ber 1727 and 13 January 1728) in Ram Raz, Essay, xi-xii. 52. Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, 228. 53. Ibid., 227-230. 54. On this, besides Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, see Michael W. Meister, "On the Development of a Morphology for a Symbolic Architecture," Res 12 (Autumn 1986): 33-50. This argument has a wide appeal; see also Joseph Rykwert, The Idea of a Town (Princeton, 1976). 55. Although many refer to the mandala in this operative sense, few writ- ers have chosen to discuss the matter in any great depth. Those that have include Michael W. Meister, "Mandala and Practice in Nagara Architec- ture in North India," Journal of the American Oriental Society 99 (1979): 204-219; and, idem, "Measurement and Proportion in Hindu Temple Architecture," Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 10 (1985): 248-258. Volwah- sen, Living Architecture: Indian, 43-58, although writing for a more popu- lar audience, provides quite a detailed discussion on the matter. 56. For recent views on this issue, see Anna L. Dallapiccola, ed., Sastric Tra- ditions in Indian Arts (Stuttgart, 1989). Dallapiccola, in her introduction (xv), for instance, compares the instructions in the vastu manuals to those given in Renaissance cookbooks. In these books, she writes, "Such things as quan- tities and timings are mentioned, if at all, only vaguely, the authors presup- posing a sound practical knowledge." 57.

Although Meister does not dwell on the fact, this temple illustrates that to have square interiors of sanctums-although the norm-was not an absolute imperative and that alternatives to the square garbha grhas do exist. 70. Despite the fact that the vastu texts are rather particular in specifying the width of the lines (siras) that intersect to form marmas, there seem to be almost no specifications of the distances at which these lines should be drawn in the diagram. Moreover, there is a considerable disagreement upon which lines (if any) of the Vastupurusamandala diagram constitute the siras. See Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, 53-55, for a comparison of the marnas specified in some of the texts. In general, it needs to be clarified that the siras of the Vas- tupurusa are only defined as the lines along which his limbs are placed. They may or may not coincide with the subdivisions of the Vastumandala. 71. Ibid., 232. 72. Ibid., 228. 73. Meister, "Measurement and Proportion." 74. Ibid., 248. Meister has adopted this idea from Kramrisch. 75. Ibid., 252. 76. Ibid., 249. 77. C. G. Hempel, Mind and Cosmos (Pittsburgh, 1966), 132. 78. Kramrisch's idea of the generic "Hindu temple" is an obvious and telling product of this view. Coomaraswamy's views on this are more subtle but no less explicit. See Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, "Rape of a Nagi," Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 35 (1937); reprinted in Lipsey, ed., Coomaraswamy, 331-340. 79. See n. 29. 80. Kramrisch, Hindu Temple, 50-57.

Not quite complete in its description, but at least listing the entire series. Texts such as the Brhatsamhita mention only two grids. See Acharya, Man- asara, 44-45. He does not point out the distinction between the southern and northern schools, but Dutt (Town Planning in Ancient India, 149) does: It is the authors of the Silpa Sastras who have made their folk-planning hinge upon padavinyasa, whereas Kautilya, Sukracharya and the author of Agnipu- rana do not refer to padavinyasa.... Their method of allocating sites and folk is therefore quite independent of padavinyasa and the various classes and professions have been represented in their ideal towns in quarters selected only with reference to the site of the royal mansions. The latter authorities all belong to Northern India. Do we get here a glimpse of two schools, North- ern and Southern? 90.
