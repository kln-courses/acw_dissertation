<plain_text><page sequence="1">Critical a : Nietzsche and Deleuze Jill Marsden We are making an experiment with truth. Perhaps man will perish as a result of it? So be it! amously, Kant envisaged the role of critique as that of curtailing the JL pretensions of reason to its own transcendence. As such, the object of critical philosophy was to expose "dialectical illusion" by a rigorous policing of the domain of legitimate application of concepts (CP Bxxv). Kant's "experiment"?incontrovertibly negative insofar as it limits the claims of speculative reason?disavows any nihilistic impetus on the grounds that its aim is essentially restorative: To deny that the service which the Critique renders is positive in character, would thus be like saying that the police are of no positive benefit, inas much as their main business is merely to prevent the violence of which citizens stand in mutual fear, in order that each may pursue his vocation in peace and security. (Bxxv) The critical aggression which exposes the lures and "deceitful promises" of dogmatic philosophy thus simultaneously understands itself as an exer cise in damage limitation, voiding the horizon of metaphysical thinking in order to speculate anew under the precept of preservation. According to Gilles Deleuze, the destructive force of Kant's great critical enterprise is inhibited by a paranoid craving for justification: "[I]t begins by believing in what it criticises": Critique has done nothing and says nothing insofar as it is has not been brought to bear on truth itself, on true knowledge, on true morality, on true religion.

In a vehement assault on the ascetic ideal in On the Genealogy of Mor als, Nietzsche claims that both the earliest and the most recent philoso phers have remained oblivious to how much the will to truth itself first requires justification: "[T]ruth was not permitted to be a problem at all" (GM III, 24). Indeed, it is in order to rid critical philosophy of its theologi cal relics and anthropocentric sentimentality that Nietzsche proposes his own experiment: The will to truth requires a critique?let us thus define our own task?the value of truth must for once be experimentally called into question. (Ill, 24) Taking this to be one of Nietzsche's central tasks, Deleuze provocatively argues in Nietzsche and Philosophy that Nietzsche's genealogical method must be seen as an attempt to radicalize Kantian critical thinking. Follow ing Deleuze, I aim in this paper to consider the extent to which Nietzsche's philosophy might be regarded as both the exacerbation and the perpetua tion of critique. For Deleuze, a radicalization of Kantian critique consti tutes a genealogy of values?a critique which articulates the differential element of values from which their value itself emerges. I shall argue that the most fruitful understanding of this differential element resides in an analysis of Nietzsche's philosophy of "productive embodiment" or incor poration?the term I believe Nietzsche uses to describe the operation of a transcendental unconscious. Beginning with a brief account of Deleuze's reading in Nietzsche and Philosophy, I go on to show how for Nietzsche the critique of truth entails an exploration of the will to power as a physi ological dynamic, specifically in terms of a recursion to corporeal condi tions of possibility. In highlighting the production of values through "in corporation," I propose to show how Nietzsche both succeeds in cultivat ing a viable postmodern philosophy of difference and consummates the destiny of critique as an active process of philosophy. 1. Deleuze and Critique According to Deleuze, Kant's genius in The Critique of Pure Reason was to conceive of an immanent critique; but, having sharpened his scalpel, Kant fails to incise with sufficient ruthlessness. His claim is that Kant lacked a method which permitted reason to be judged from the inside without giving it the task of being its own judge:</page><page sequence="3">Critical Incorporation 35 Transcendental philosophy discovers conditions which still remain exter nal to the conditioned. Transcendental principles are principles of condi tioning and not of internal genesis. (NP 91) Whilst Kantian critique brings itself to bear on claims to knowledge and truth, it fails to criticise knowledge and truth as values. Unable to provide a genesis of reason itself, transcendental philosophy displays a nostalgic attachment to noumenal subjectivity, especially in its practical or self-leg islating aspect (where will is abstracted from the dynamic of willing and reinserted in the subject as quasi-cause). In this regard, Kantian critique remains faithful to the institutions which it challenges, criticising soul as substance but only to rehabilitate it, albeit anaemically, as form. The error which Kant terms paralogism?the conflation of the formal conditions of a thought with its object?is one to which the critique falls prey insofar as it remains wedded to the subject/object structure of representation. For example, whilst Kant confines himself to an analysis of how knowledge is produced in the world of phenomena, the truth value of the a priori form of objectivity remains unquestioned (for by definition as "necessary" and "uni versal" it exceeds the phenomenal realm). In this respect, truth is still "given" and guarantees a correspondence between the understanding and its world (with willing as transcendental agency providing the condition of possibil ity for the legitimate application of concepts). Kant's revised ontology con tinues to presuppose the legitimacy of the belief in knowledge guaranteed by that which lies outside the realm of the conditioned and hence never questions a priority as value. In Nietzsche and Philosophy, Deleuze argues that, whereas Kantian critique falls short of posing the problem of critique in terms of values, Nietzsche's thinking impacts upon contemporary philosophical sensibility in terms of a fulfillment of the critical enterprise: "[W]ith Nietzsche, we must begin from the fact that the philosophy of values as envisaged and established by him is the true realisation of critique and the only way in which a total critique may be realised, the only way to 'philosophise with a hammer'" (NP 1). Deleuze suggests that for Nietzsche the fundamental values which undergird transcendental philosophy have to be called into question for just as evaluation presupposes values on the basis of which phenomena are judged, values similarly presuppose evaluations?"perspec tives" of ajudication which give rise to values. Consequently, "[t]he prob lem of critique is that of the value of values, of the evaluation from which their value arises, thus the problem of their creation" (1). For Deleuze, only the genealogical method enables the effective accomplishment of in</page><page sequence="4">36 Jill Marsden ternal critique. Rather than presupposing transcendent control structures, Nietzsche attempts to address the problem of their emergence or genesis. In this respect, his genealogy is as opposed to criticising things in the name of established or absolute values as it is to relativizing them in the name of utilitarian "facts." In either of these modes, philosophy inhabits the indif ferent element of the valuable in itself or the valuable for all. In contrast, Deleuze writes that Nietzsche's genealogy "signifies the differential ele ment of values from which their value itself derives" (2). The differential element expresses the "pathos of difference or distance" which unfolds in the origin of values and the evaluation of origins. Since evaluations are ways of being, "conditions of life" for those who evaluate, they serve as principles for the values that these "evaluators" use. For Deleuze, the cru cial point is that high and low, noble and base, are not values but represent the differential element from which the value of values themselves derives. (2) High and low do not represent fixed points on a scale of evaluations but mark what type and degree of confrontation or relation of domination is operative between "forces"?what conditions of life are determinative in any given state. No state is interpreted independently of the forces which instantiate it; consequently, no phenomenon "in itself is incontrovertibly noble or base (not even the much maligned Platonism). What is no longer tenable for genealogical thinking is the concept of a value in itself, even truth must be understood as the product of the differential element or inter relation of forces. Deleuze's aim in thus aligning Nietzschean genealogy with critique is to articulate a thought of difference which is not already constituted by identity (and its monopoly of the True) a nonparalogical conception of difference which enables the differentiation between differ ences at the origin of values. At the heart of Deleuze's reading of Nietzsche lies a profound appre ciation of the centrality of force to all aspects of his thought. For Nietzsche, the modern physics of force discloses nature in its wild, amoral, and inhu man vitality. Lacking "order, organisation, form, beauty, wisdom" and ev ery other category deemed anthropomorphic, the "universe" of forces is said to retain only "necessity" (GS 109) or the relation between dynamic quanta in tension with all other dynamic quanta (WP 635). For example, in The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche speaks of the warring "art forces of na ture" which struggle and couple to engender their creations "without the mediation of the human artist"; indeed, the artist is merely the vehicle through which the physiological forces of dream and intoxication animate, create, and recreate Hellenic art (BT 2). Scrupulously resisting the infer</page><page sequence="5">Critical Incorporation 37 enee that productivity entails an agent of production, Nietzsche avoids the error that Kant terms paralogism. Since there are no subsisting "entities," substances, or unities subtending or transcending this constantly changing flux of forces, Nietzsche's diagnostic or "genealogical" interpretation of a given "phenomenon" takes as its chief clue the degree of resistance and the degree of superior power in every happening. However, such an interpretative method is strictly speaking illegible from the perspective of the philosophy of identity which first schematises and harnesses the anarchic interplay of force into the form of logical-meta physical postulates and then proceeds to identify determinate relations be tween representations. Thanks to the deep-rooted prejudice that it is neces sary to "hold as true" that which remains "the same," this mode of philoso phising has enjoyed unquestioned epistemological dominion. Indeed, the volatile dynamic of the world as flux of forces is as unthinkable for dog matic metaphysics as it is for Kantian transcendental philosophy; whether viewed as eternal Eidos or a priori form of objectivity, "truth" must be pre given, unproduced: In order to think and infer it is necessary to assume beings: logic only handles formulas for what remains the same. That is why this assumption would not be a proof of reality: beings' are part of our perspective. The 'ego' as a being (?not affected by becoming and development). The fictitious world of subject, substance, 'reason,' etc., is needed?: there is in us a power to order, simplify, falsify, artificially distinguish. "Truth" is the will to be master over the multiplicity of sensations: to clas sify phenomena into definite categories. In this we start from a belief in the 'in-itself ' of things (we take phenomena as real). The character of the world in a state of becoming as incapable of formulation, as 'false,' as 'self-contradictory.' Knowledge and becoming exclude one another. (WP 517) If it is necessary to assume beings in order to "think," then knowledge and becoming are inherently incompatible. Nietzsche speculates that the perdurant "ego" "is the sole being, after the model of which we fashion and understand all being"?the supreme court of appeal, that which remains unaffected by becoming and change (518). But this reign is tyrannical, enforcing its law upon a multiplicity of sensations which it imperiously holds in check. From such a perspective, the body is mere matter, a passive resource for the imposition of form whilst knowledge is the vehicle through which the body conserves its energies, masters multiplicity, preserves its equilibrium. To attempt to philosophise differently, to think of multiplicity without commuting it to identity, a different perspective is required. Hence Nietzsche's great insight: to reject the "perspective illusion" of unity that</page><page sequence="6">38 Jill Marsden the ego promotes and take instead the body as "starting point" for critique (492). In taking the body as his starting point, Nietzsche perceives a differ ence at the origin of thinking. In contrast to the metaphysics of identity which reduces the many to the One, the physiology of the body exhibits tremendous multiplicity and perspectival range. From the vantage point of consciousness, the body is something that has form and may be admitted into the vocabulary of identitarian thinking, but from the vantage point of the body, it is a bogus unity, only ever the aggregation of the relations of continually fluctuating forces. For this reason, Nietzsche's genealogy is always at some level a genealogy of the body, a "diagnosis" of its varying modalities and regimes. In an exquisite definition in The Will to Power notes, Nietzsche characterizes the human body as that in which the most distant and most immediate past of all organic becom ing comes back to life and becomes incarnate, through which and over and beyond which a tremendous silent current seems to flow. (WP 659) As is made clear in this passage, for Nietzsche the body is not a spatially or temporally robust structure, still less an index of personal identity. Rather, the physiological is regarded as an economy of immanently self-organiz ing constitutive processes. One might think of the "current" which traverses the body in terms of the energies of desire, the material flows or "libidinal" drives which orientate the forces of life. In contrast to the Kantian concep tion of desire as the manipulation of matter by the intentionality of a repre senting subject, Nietzsche reinscribes willing as ateleological, pre-repre sentational, and opaque. Consequently, the currents which orientate the physiological are not to be equated with the so-called "natural appetites" attributed to a body when it is apprehended mechanistically as a functional or rational entity. The drives of the desiring body operate independently of transcendent control structures, are inherently plastic, and freely admit sub stitution in their "objects." As a result, one is unable to chart their trajec tory a priori, hence the task of interpretation falls to a genealogical diagno sis of their dynamic. It could be argued that, in theorising the body thus, Nietzsche is en gaged in the project of determining a transcendental unconscious defined by the immanence of its criteria. Such a view is intimated by Deleuze, who follows Nietzsche's cue in situating his account of the philosophy of forces in terms of the body: Every force is related to others and it either obeys or commands. What defines a body is this relation between dominant and dominated forces. Every relationship of forces constitutes a body as soon as they enter into a relationship. (NP 40)</page><page sequence="7">Critical Incorporation 39 As Deleuze explains in Nietzsche and Philosophy, the being of force is plural, for every force is essentially related to another force (7). Indeed, this is the interrelation of force which Deleuze calls the differential ele ment and which Nietzsche names the "will to power." Inasmuch as will can only operate on will, Nietzsche maintains that "in all willing it is abso lutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis ... of a social structure composed of many souls" (BGE 19). Deleuze proposes that "in a body the superior or dominant forces are known as active and the inferior or dominated forces are known as reactive" (NP 40). Active and reactive are the qualities which express the relation of force with force. Deleuze claims that for Nietzsche an active force affirms its difference from an other force whereas a reactive force merely "denies all that it is not and makes this negation its own essence and the principle of its existence" (9). The difference between a body subordinated by the edicts of reason and an exuberant corporeality which takes itself as its "starting point" is here im plicit. As Nietzsche expresses it, While every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself, slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside,' what is 'different/ what is 'not itself; and this No is its creative deed. This inver sion of the value-positing eye?this need to direct one's view outward instead of back to oneself?is of the essence of ressentiment: in order to exist, slave morality always first needs a hostile external world; it needs, physiologically speaking, external stimuli in order to act at all?its action is fundamentally reaction. (GM I, 10) Nietzsche claims that the noble mode of evaluation "acts and grows spontaneously," engaging its opposite only to affirm itself triumphally. However, because active forces are nonteleological, unpredictable, and excessive, they escape apprehension by consciousness (whereas reactive forces can be understood in relation to superior forces). Modern thought attends almost exclusively to the reactive aspect of forces, overlooking the "essential priority of the spontaneous, aggressive, expansive, form-giving forces that give new interpretations and directions" (GM II, 12,79). A prime example of this is evolutionary theory, which places "adaption" in the fore ground, defining life as "a more and more efficient inner adaption to exter nal conditions" (II, 12, 79). However, for Nietzsche, Life is not the adaption of inner circumstances to outer ones, but will to power, which, working from within, incorporates and subdues more and more of that which is 'outside.' (WP 681) Contrary to the Darwinists, who construe life as fundamental reactive?a tactics of environmental adaption for survival?Nietzsche suggests that life is ineluctably superabundant, fervently creative and combative:</page><page sequence="8">40 Jill Marsden The will to power can manifest itself only against resistances; it therefore seeks out that which resists it,?this is the original tendency of the proto plasm when it sends out pseudopodia and feels about. Appropriation and incorporation are above all a wanting-to-overwhelm, a forming and shap ing and reorganizing until finally that which has been overwhelmed has merged completely into the power of the attacker and has increased it. (WP 656; 12/424/9[151]; translation modified) The insatiable drive to appropriate manifests itself in the riotous inunda tion and assimilation of whatever is alien, recalcitrant, or weaker than it self. This is the most basic tendency of life as will to power, which even in its elementary animal forms "seeks to incorporate into itself as much as possible, not just to compensate for loss?it is acquisitive" (9/490-1/ 11 [134]). The restorative impulse is superseded by a thirst for expansion and conquest but it is an exorbitant desire, too great to be attributed to any perceived "goal": One cannot ascribe the most basic and primeval activities of protoplasm to a will to self-preservation, for it takes into itself absurdly more than would be required to preserve it; and above all, it does not thereby 'preserve it self,' it falls apart?The drive that rules here has to explain precisely this absence of the desire for self-preservation: 'hunger' is an interpretation based on far more complicated organisms (?hunger is a specialized and later form of the drive, an expression of a division of labour in the service of a higher drive that rules over it). (WP 651) In this passage and in related notes Nietzsche explicitly denies that hunger or the drive to self-preservation are "first causes" and emphasises the point that such excessive engorgement "is by no means a matter of restoring a loss" (13/361/14[174]; WP 652). Indeed, it is only retrospectively that the organism's "need to appropriate" is "reduced to hunger, to the need to re place what has been lost" (13/361/14[174]; WP 652). Moreover, since this excessive consumption obeys no compulsion to conserve, its massive po tential for accumulation does not function as a stabilizing mechanism but rather constitutes a mode of expenditure suicidally bound to annihilation. Such ruinous excess cannot be represented within the balance sheets and account books of the philosophy of identity. Life as active incorporation is sacrificial, fatally indifferent to its own self-preservation. What emerges from Nietzsche's physiology of forces is a virulent cri tique of the reactive conditions that ground the philosophy of identity. For rationalist, utilitarian thinking, the premise is that desire has determinate objects and is initiated by experience of their lack (hence the stabilising no tion of fulfillment or restoration of loss). Such principles are manifested in a mode of reasoning which collapses irreducible differences into indifferen</page><page sequence="9">Critical Incorporation 41 tiation or equilibrium (being and nothing are thus both seen as equally un differentiated). By contrast, for a thought of desire liberated from the repre sentation of some desired thing, the drive that rules is insatiable, unassimilable within the humanist logic of self-preservation. Here another thought of dif ference is possible beyond the orbit of exchange where profit and loss are commensurated: difference as nondialectical, irreducible, active. On Deleuze's reading this new notion of difference is yielded through a close interrogation of Nietzsche's conception of the quantity and quality of force. Arguing that the quantity of force is inseparable from difference in quantity, Deleuze maintains that the relation of force to force can never be reduced to equality: Quality is distinct from quantity but only because it is that aspect of quan tity that cannot be equalised, that cannot be equalised out in the difference between quantities. Difference in quantity is therefore, in one sense, the irreducible element of quantity and in another sense the element which is irreducible to quantity itself. Quality is nothing but difference in quantity and corresponds to it each time forces enter into relation. (NP 43-44) If we accept the thesis that difference in quantity reflects a differential ele ment of related forces, this may be regarded as the genetic element of the qualities of these forces. For example, forces are said to be dominant or dominated depending on their difference in quantity, yet active or reactive depending on their quality. Deleuze summarises this succinctly in terms of Nietzsche's notion of "will to power": "The will to power is the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quan tity that devolves into each force in this relation" (50). The implications of this for the argument that Nietzsche radicalizes Kantian critique are clear: because the will to power is never separable from particular forces, it changes itself with the conditioned and "determines itself in each case along with what it determines" (50). It is a plastic principle which is "no wider than what it conditions." As Deleuze takes pains to explain, relations of forces remain indeterminate without will to power as the internal differential and genetic (genealogical) element. In other words, forces in relation recipro cally reflect a difference in quantity which is simultaneously the site of pro duction of their respective qualities. Will to power thus names the produc tive material becoming of forces as self-differentiating and radically imper sonal. It is these processes of primary productive synthesis which function as the "condition of possibility" for thought, without recourse to any tran scendent intelligence. Deleuze suggests that with this conception Nietzsche radically transforms Kantianism and succeeds in mobilizing a "re-invention of critique which Kant betrayed at the same time as he conceived it, a re sumption of the critical project on a new basis and with new concepts" (52).</page><page sequence="10">42 Jill Marsden 2. Incorporation Whilst Kantian philosophy fails to wield the critical knife against the tran scendental ground of knowing, Nietzschean genealogy dissolves every rem nant of transcendence into a metamorphic economy of "insatiable desire" {WP 619). This is achieved through the will to power which as a plastic principle presupposes no "given" yet is determinative insofar as it "inter prets" the differential collisions of force. The importance of understanding this corporeally cannot be overestimated, for central to Nietzsche's phi losophy of forces is the claim that values are generated physiologically, indeed, that "value is the highest quantum of power that a man is able to incorporate" (713). In articulating this thought, it is just as imperative to distinguish Nietzsche's position from crude materialism as it is to avoid the paralogical inference that values are manipulated by human subjects. Such would be the perspective of the philosophy of identity with its func tionalist, reductive view of matter (the body tyrannized by consciousness). From the perspective of the philosophy of irreducible difference, however, matter is inherently excessive, hence anthropocentric notions of subject object relations are no longer pertinent: The will to power interprets (?it is a question of interpretation when an organ is constructed): it defines limits, determines degrees, variations of power. Mere variations of power could not feel themselves to be such: there must be present something that wants to grow and interprets the value of whatever else wants to grow. Equal in that?In fact, interpretation is itself a means of becoming master of something. (The organic process constantly presupposes interpretations.) (643) The will to power produces values as the internal differential and genetic element of forces. In the passage cited, Nietzsche says that it is a question of interpretation when an organ is constructed?a matter of defining bound aries and determining differentials of power. This prompts the thought that not only are values produced physiologically but that they simultaneously express an immanent evaluation of their mode of expenditure (growth). Nietzsche's radical claim is that values are produced in accordance with the capacity for a life form to interpret itself (for example, as active or reactive)?an argument which relocates the agency of critique at the level of the physiological. Two interrelated questions arise at this juncture: first, how does Nietzsche's genealogy of the body function as critique (specifically, as a critique of the will to truth) and, second, how is this critique materialized or embodied*! To pursue this exploration it will be useful to counterpose what might be termed the corpus of ressentiment or rational body to</page><page sequence="11">Critical Incorporation 43 Nietzsche's exorbitant or desiring body (the philosophy of forces). As we have commented, the rational body functions according to the principles of work, conservation, and utility?calculative processes which regulate its organs and privatise its surfaces. Consumption is controlled and organised by interior mechanisms which articulate the hierarchical structure of the rational body-politic, the myriad minor processes subordinated to the au tocracy of consciousness (where secondary processes diligently manufac ture "needs"). The exorbitant body, however, is invertebral, intensive, and subtly inventive. Its boundaries are provisional rather than primordial, knit ted from the scar tissue of perpetual dehiscence. To the conservative plea sures of self-preservation it exhibits the violent pleasures of nonproductive expenditure. It is active, rapacious, a multiplicity of subjects and perspec tives. The difference between these two conceptions of the body mirrors the difference Nietzsche identifies between slave and master morality? the difference between negation and affirmation of difference. Employing these two models of the body it is possible to illuminate Nietzsche's unique assertion that values are physiological. It is clear that for Nietzsche "truth" as such is no longer the salient criterion in evaluating claims to knowledge. Truth as it has been apprehended hitherto concerns the conservation or preservation of a particular form of life?an error with out which a certain kind of being could not survive (WP 493). It could be argued that this is the modus of the rational body which has ceased to ac knowledge its growth?the sterile corpus of metaphysical thinking. In sec tion 11 of The Gay Science, Nietzsche comments that "consciousness is the last and latest development of the organic and hence what is also most unfinished and unstrong" (GS 11); nevertheless, the thought that conscious ness is in a process of becoming is suppressed by the rational body which tyrannically harnesses its energies and rejects its mutability: One thinks that it constitutes the kernel of man; what is abiding, eternal, ultimate, and most original in him. One takes consciousness for a determi nate magnitude. One denies its growth and its intermittences. One takes it for the 'unity of the organism'. (11) As a static and impotent entity, the rational body inhibits its own agency, interpreting itself solely from the perspective of reactive forces. For this reason, the potentiality for transmutation?for the creation of knowledge? fails to materialize. Intriguingly, the passage ends thus: To this day the task of incorporating knowledge and making it instinctive is only beginning to dawn on the human eye and is not yet clearly discern ible; it is a task that is seen only by those who have comprehended that so far we have incorporated only our errors and that all our consciousness relates to errors.</page><page sequence="12">44 Jill Marsden Blind to its creative potential as active force, consciousness is only able to view the body from the perspective of its reactions (needs): it is thus un able to perceive the task of incorporating knowledge and making it part of its materiality. Nietzsche's employment of the specific term incorporation is of vital importance to his critical enterprise. We have already encountered its use in his remarks on the activity of life as will to power where it designates the dynamic of engulfing or appropriation of that which is "outside." With respect to this apparently ceaseless insurgency, it is significant that Nietzsche should employ a noun of continuous action. Incorporation ox Einverleibung indicates a strong sense of process, the temporally unspecified perpetuity of an activity. In the context of articulating Nietzsche's physiology of val ues, it has special significance because Einverleibung literally means "to take something in to the body (der Leib), to in-corporate, and especially to voraciously ingest." As an exorbitant index of positive desire, Einverleibung always involves increase, a becoming greater or more. Since this constant inclusion is not mediated by a pr?existent interiority, the body which incor porates is itself created by incorporation. Whatever is taken in "from the outside" forms the "inside" as such. In this way, what the organism con sumes or incorporates becomes the same as itself, a "oneness" exorbitantly generated from diversity. Returning to the problem of truth, Nietzsche suggests that knowledge hitherto has consisted in the incorporation of error. It is claimed that as a creature who first fashions the things which it identifies as "being," the human animal is like the protozoan, subduing and imposing form on what is outer. Hence: [Man's] means of nourishing himself and of appropriating things is to bring them into 'forms' and rhythms. Grasping is first of all only creation of 'things'. Knowledge a means of nourishment. ( 10/651/24[ 14]) However, this "creation of things" or 'forms' necessarily entails abstraction from the incorporating process. There would be no possibility of recognising anything recurring without this initial dissociative act. Thus Nietzsche writes, Without the transformation of the world into forms and rhythms there would be for us nothing the 'same', therefore nothing recurring, therefore also no possibility of experience and appropriation, of nourishment. (11/608/38[10]) Nietzsche's point is that the "logical" concept of the self-identical "same" integral to the philosophy of identity is clearly derivative from the process of "making the same." The epistemologicai notion of identity is abstracted from this fluid course of becoming and is treated as an entity that has fin</page><page sequence="13">Critical Incorporation 45 ished becoming. On the basis of this ideal notion of identity, differences are dialectically determined and a whole conceptual edifice is constructed. As Nietzsche remarks in The Will to Power notes, All thinking, judging, perceiving as comparison has presupposed a "posit ing as same", earlier still a "making the same". The making the same is like the incorporation of appropriated material into the amoeba. (WP 501 ; 12/209/5[65]; translation modified) He goes on to remark in the same passage that, with the later advent of the faculty of recollection, the drive to equalize or make-the-same is "tamed" and difference is preserved within the rigid taxonomies of the mind. Thus the secondary processes triumph; exclusive disjunction is introduced into the gleichmachende Triebe and the "same" as product is abstracted from its process of production. Safely back within the cage of consciousness, exorbitancy becomes quantified, identifiable, useful. The ego accordingly re-cognises identity as that which recurs as the same, as that which may be re-presented to it. Knowing stabilizes the chaotic flux of becoming, wrests unchanging being from the heterogeneous flows. This is what Nietzsche me?ns when he speaks about the incorporation of error. It serves reactive life. It prevents it from inundation by a riot of contradictory pulsions. Nietzsche does not deny how useful these errors have been. Indeed, the strictures of the philosophy of identity have been so effectively en gulfed that they have become instinctive. The critical edge of Nietzsche's inquiry resides in the thought that the sustenance of a body by this knowl edge denies the dynamic of incorporation as perpetual: The most strongly believed a priori "truths" are for me?provisional as sumptions; e.g. the law of causality, a very well acquired habit of belief, so incorporated that not to believe in it would destroy the race. But are they for that reason truths? What a conclusion! As if the preservation of man were a proof of truth! (WP 497; translation modified) The question is whether the body is able to liberate itself from its "life preserving errors" in order to philosophise anew, a prospect it has been suggested that Kantian critique was unable to countenance. Nietzsche claims in The Gay Science that all the higher functions of the organism have oper ated "with those basic errors which have been incorporated since time im memorial" becoming "the norms according to which 'true' and 'untrue' were determined?down to the most remote regions of logic" (GS 110): Thus the strength of knowledge does not depend on its degree of truth but on its age, on the degree to which it has been incorporated, on its character as a condition of life. (110)</page><page sequence="14">46 Jill Mars??n These conditions, inherently corporeal, present the question as to whether a life-form is able to expend itself?sacrificing its own "ground"?or whether it seeks to preserve itself, inhibited by its thirst for secure terrain: A thinker is now that being in whom the impulse for truth and those life preserving errors clash for their first fight, after the impulse for truth has proved to be also a life-preserving power. Compared to the significance of this fight, everything else is a matter of indifference: the ultimate question about the conditions of life has been posed here, and we confront the first attempt to answer this question by experiment. To what extent can truth endure incorporation? That is the question; that is the experiment. (110). 3. Critical Embodiment It is now possible to add a further dimension to our account of how Nietzsche's genealogy of the body succeeds in both radicalizing Kantian critique and in generating a nonreductive postmodern philosophy of differ ence. As has been demonstrated, the philosophy of identity depends on physiological gleich-machende Prozesse for its infrastructure of iterability and hence, quite literally, feeds on itself. An "eternal return of the same," understood metaphysically as the reproduction of a forsaken identity within a closed circuit of meaning or thought, qualifies recurrence by a notion of the "same" which has been abstracted from the process of becoming-the same and is now regarded as being-the-same (the incorporated errors of the rational body). However, as noted earlier, the movement of incorpora tion which makes-something-the-same has no terminus?indeed, engorges to the point of self-ruination or disintegration. As a noun of continuous action, Einverleibung not only expresses the exorbitant insatiability of this process, but also defies division into the subject/object structure of noun/ verb. The grammatico-conceptual prejudice of appending a detemporalised subject to a temporalised action is here forestalled. Consequently, for the incorporating body of desire, the "same" in no sense constitutes a substan tive state, but rather materialises as immanent to the fluid, metamorphic movement of becoming. This entails in turn that recurrence is no longer posited as a transcendent principle which modifies a given set of entities but is itself to be thought of as internal to becoming-the-same. In the ab sence of a fixed being which would order, organize, and control the disper sion of identities across a delimited terrain, becoming-the-same/incorpora tion unfolds as anarcho-logic, a rampant phagomania which reaches a limit only at the point beyond which it encounters resistance or disintegrates. In each case it "overcomes" what it has "become" since it is unable to stabi lize (and hence unable to function as a ground). Thus incorporation by</page><page sequence="15">Critical Incorporation 47 passes the exigencies of the functional body (hunger and its satisfaction), for it cannot be contained or completed within itself: every "becoming" is perpetually "thrown over" as drives return upon themselves to commence the process anew. It is thus apparent that for Nietzsche's genealogy incorporation eter nally generates sameness from the chaotic upsurge and release of forces, from the pulses of creation and destruction in the ongoing flow of ecstatic becoming. In this respect, it is possible to see how will to power functions as a principle of Nietzsche's own philosophy of eternal return?as the dif ferential element where all forces will be played out. It is now plausible to assert that the will to power is a derivative transcendental, derivative be cause it is the plane generated by forces yet transcendental because it is where forces synthesize. Diversity thus emerges as something that is pro duced by incorporation as irreducible quantitative difference. The differ ential element expresses that which is shared in a multiplicity, a sameness which materializes in the process of incorporation. Incorporation describes the in-bodying/embodying of knowledge that overthrows the organism and as such threatens the stability of the rational body. To phrase this in a Kantian idiom, one could say that it is a matter of critique confronting its own con dition of possibility. Because incorporation is plastic, the distinction be tween inside and outside is immanent to the movement of incorporation itself. Boundaries materialize in their actualization or passage and thus never stabilize as constitutive or categorial. * Critical incorporation articulates a philosophy of active differentiation which engenders its concepts from nonparalogized synthesis. Herein, the Deleuzian "differential element" names that which is shared in multiplicities of force, but it is a "ground" which is both derivative and transitory. As has been shown, it is fruitless to attempt to break quantitative difference down into an underlying unity or identity because there is no ground underlying forces. Value as the highest quantum of power that an individual is able to incor porate expresses the standpoint for the increase or decrease of dominating forces: "the standpoint of conditions of preservation and enhancement for complex forms of relative life duration within the flux of becoming" (WP 715). Consequently, it is the will to power that interprets because it deter mines the force which gives sense to a thing and affirmation and negation are its primordial qualities. In asking which values are productive in a given phenomenon, the genealogist asks a physiological question rather than an ontological one, judging whether a body has ceased to metabolise alterity</page><page sequence="16">48 Jill Marsden or whether it continues to affirm and enhance itself. For Nietzsche physi ological values bear directly upon the Kantian notion of critique because they determine the conditions of possibility for a phenomenon?whether hunger or plenitude has become "creative." Eerily reminiscent of Kant's insistences in the preface to The Critique of Pure Reason, Deleuze maintains that Nietzschean critique is positive: Critique is not a re-action of re-sentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being, the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined. (NP 3) However, there is a difference between the Kantian and the Nietzschean evaluations of positivity, a difference at the origin, as it were. Whereas Kant criticises in order to secure a certain terrain for knowledge, Nietzsche philosophises with a hammer, affirming "the eternal joy of becoming? that joy which also encompasses joy in destruction" ( , p. 110). Unlike a critique which preserves the forces of law and order, Nietzschean critique breaks down police cordons in contempt of the high court of reason. It is an experiment with truth from which the thinker will not emerge unscathed. No longer joy in certainty but in uncertainty; no longer 'cause and effect* but the continually creative; no longer will to preservation but to power; no longer the humble expression, 'everything is merely subjective/ but 'it is also our work!?Let us be proud of it!'
