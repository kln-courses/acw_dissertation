<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHURCH HISTORY distinct patterns which suggest the following categories: (1) the moralists (Catherine Beecher and Isabella Beecher Hooker); (2) the prophets (Edward Beecher and Charles Beecher); and (3) the Christocentric liberals (Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry Ward Beecher, and Thomas Kennicut Beecher). These designations prove adequate to the individual variations of the common family theology and thus provide a helpful framework for under- standing the divergences as well as the continuities in the Beechers' religious experience and thought. The author demonstrates that the matrix for Beecher religious experience was the evangelical household; the inherited theological context from which these variations in Beecher religious thought developed was Lyman Beecher's version of Timothy Dwight's New Haven Theology. Caskey's chapter on spiritualism, describing its attraction for the Beechers and for others in late nineteenth-century American culture, is illuminating. Her final chapter is an examination of the Beechers' doctrine of God and human nature under the following categories: (1) theodicy, (2) election and reprobation, (3) the ethical character of divine law, (4) anthropomorphism, and (5) the divine and human roles in salvation. Ms. Caskey's writing is orderly and lucid. Her documentation is both accurate and exhaustive with extensive endnotes. A seventeen-page bibliog- raphy of both primary and secondary sources adds to the study's value. Carefully edited with an index which is accurate and adequate, this book is a milestone in Beecher studies. Florida State University LEO SANDON, JR. Tallahassee, Florida Octavius Brooks Frothingham, Gentle Radical. By J. WADE CARUTHERS. University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 1977. ix + 279 pp. $15.00. Octavius Brooks Frothingham, a moving spirit of the Free Religious Association and interpreter of the Unitarian and Transcendentalist move- ments in America, is a figure eminently deserving of the biography which Professor Caruthers has now provided. The history of liberal religion after the Transcendentalist "heresy" has only recently begun to receive serious attention, and the rise and decline of the FRA has frequently been overlooked in surveys of the American religious experience. Frothingham himself was the author of at least two works, Transcendentalism in New England and Boston Unitarianism, which are still minor classics, and deserve to stay in print. Caruthers' biography of Frothingham succeeds in compiling a great deal of information about the career of a man whose personal life is somewhat difficult to gain access to by the historian. It is also successful in summarizing 216</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS and evaluating Frothingham's controversial and scholarly works. More attention to the second and less to the first, in which some of the details tend towards monotony, would have been appreeiated. Another major theme is Frothingham's career as a leader of the FRA, which in this work seems to lack focus. More attention to the history and context of the movement itself perhaps would have been useful here. In short, this biography is a useful contribution to our knowledge of liberal religion, although it offers little novelty in the realm of interpretation. The listing of primary sources is quite helpful, though there are some curious gaps in the general bibliography. Furthermore, one must note the execrable lack of attention to detail in the spelling of proper names, among other things. The chef doeuvre of some drunken proofreader or typesetter run amok occurs on page 16, where four German names are misspelled or otherwise mangled in the course of a single paragraph. Needless to say, this carelessness is annoying, and detracts from what is otherwise a worthwhile contribution to scholarship. Miami University PETER W. WILLIAMS Oxford, Ohio Tell It To The World: The Story of Seventh-day Adventists. By C. MERVYN MAXWELL. Mountain View, California: Pacific Press Publishing Associa- tion, 1976. 287 pp. $6.95. Professor Maxwell, a church historian at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary, produces a heilsgeschichte suited primarily for an Adventist audience. The mighty acts of God in this salvation history include Millerism and the Great Disappointment in 1844, formal organization in 1860, missionary expansion in the 1870s, debate over righteousness by faith in 1888, and reorganization of the church in 1901. On each topic Maxwell develops not so much an historical interpretation as a theological argument in story form. He finds in the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary a unique explanation for the delayed Advent. The Saturday Sabbath, borrowed from Seventh Day Baptists, assumes eschatological importance in Adventism as a means of hastening the second coming. A chapter devoted to the theological indebtedness of Adventism concludes that Adventists took only the best from other traditions. Several of the chapters were published previously as a secondary level textbook, and hence employ a popular writing style marred for historians by some contrived dialogue. Unfortunately, just as Seventh-day Adventist historiography shows signs of coming of age (and perhaps in reaction to this), Maxwell harks back to an earlier apologetics. His book may prove most useful, however, as a primary rather than a secondary source. Loma Linda University JONATHAN BUTLER Riverside, California 217</page></plain_text>
