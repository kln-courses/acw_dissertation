Landscapes of relations and belonging: body, place and politics in Wogeo, Papua New Guinea, xii, 262 pp., maps, tables, figs, illus., bibliogr. Oxford, New York: Berghahn Books, 2011. £55.00 (cloth) Landscapes of relations and belonging is an ethnography of Wogeo, an island off the north coast of Papua New Guinea. As the title suggests, Anderson is interested in the relationship between Wogeo as a lived reality and the complex of social and symbolic relations that constitute social life there. The book therefore focuses on those moments and images of social life where the physical placement and movement of persons, objects and symbols make the island and its people visible as a single meaningful manifold. This project is pursued in a way that those familiar with the ethnography of Melanesia will easily recognize: persons related along 'paths' and by fluids; relations decomposed in funerary obligations; anthropomorphic objects as models of the person and cosmos; and esoteric knowledge as Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 18, 690-7.29 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2012</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 721 the substance of power. Combining an account of custom framed in this way with contemporary developments fitting its scheme, the ethnography is solid and conventional. Wogeo is best known from Ian Hogbin's Island of menstruating men (1970). As in the case of Annette Weiner's restudy of Malinowski's Kiriwina (The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea, 1988), it is therefore impossible not to judge the apprentice in terms of the master. Anderson's book, like Hogbin's work, is certainly ethnographically rich, and she is alive to the transformations that have affected Wogeo since Hogbin worked there either side of the Second World War. Indeed, Wogeo people's interest in Hogbin as a source of knowledge on custom involves her in an intriguing dialogue with her intellectual forebear. However, in other respects, the book is seriously flawed. The theoretical motor of this book is a relation between symbols and concrete existence. Anderson asks 'how meaning is formed in a dialogical relation between embodied experience and representation'. This is an extremely interesting and important project, especially in light of a large body of anthropological theory about Melanesia which suggests that 'they' think in very different ways from 'us'. It asks the question: what is it about concrete Wogeo lives which produces this difference? Unfortunately, this book does not really provide a satisfactory answer. While it invokes the phénoménologies of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty in the same chapter as Roy Wagner's exhaustive symbolic analyses, it is not at all clear that a synthesis is possible - certainly none is achieved. Indeed, Anderson appears to make an elementary logical mistake in her attempt to reconcile these two bodies of theory: if, as Wagner argues, symbols constitute the entirety of named and speakable reality, a macrocosm that maps onto the microcosmic system of language as its analogy, then it follows that phenomenological theory is itself a component of this system. While a gesture towards 'concrete reality' is surely possible, what grounds are there for thinking that such a gesture adequately represents a substrate of 'embodied experience' any more than the anthropologist's systematization of culture maps the actual interests of her putative 'cultural subjects'? Indeed, if, as Wagner argues, culture is an anthropological mode for obviating difference, then the quest for 'embodiment' would appear to be an analogous project offering to render others imaginable on familiar terms. There is too easy a slide here between indigenous attention to bodies and philosophical phenomenology, as though they named 'the same thing'. The mistake Anderson commits is a straightforward failure of reflexivity, one that privileges her own intellectual position beyond the logical operations of the theory that she espouses. This suggests that while the central theoretical question that the book seeks to raise may be intriguing, it is not clear that it is tractable, certainly not in the way in which it is approached here. It would require a great deal more sophistication in argument to produce a convincing solution. This is no reflection on Anderson the ethnographer. The author is certainly a shrewd and sensitive observer. The text is filled with engaging details which will make this a useful text for anyone seeking themselves to undertake ethnographic research on Wogeo. However, there is a consistent failure to articulate this wealth of detail and verbatim quotation into a coherent argument which can address the difficult problem the book sets itself. Too often, paragraphs are ill structured, conclusions do not follow from the material presented, or whole sections of the text do not appear to have a governing thread. To add to these difficulties, the book has been very poorly edited and there are numerous errors in the prose, some of which seriously obscure the author's meaning. In summary, this is a poor book. It poses challenging questions and contains interesting ethnographic detail, but ultimately fails to develop either adequately. Will Rollason BruneI University</page></plain_text>
