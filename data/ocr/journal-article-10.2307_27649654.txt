Each woman was the mother of both slavery and freedom?bearing offspring for free, powerful, wealthy, and influential white men. Hemings and Silva bear the mark of slavery's contradictions on their bodies; the ineffable impression of forced volition. To invest the slave body with a sexual supremacy and affluence, to gift it with uncom plicated agency, is to work in opposition to the aggressive nature of cor poreal imperialism. As Saidiya Hartman reminds us, "The discourse of seduction obfuscates the primacy and extremity of violence in master slave relations and in the construction of the slave as both property and person ... as the enslaved is legally unable to give consent or offer resis tance, she is presumed to be always willing" (Hartman 1997, 81). Will ing or not, aggressive or submissive, the slave body is the sexual body, imprinted with the fixations of hegemonic desire and branded with the signification of all-encompassing acquiescence.

All rights reserved.</page><page sequence="2">46 BLACK RAPTURE memory of their mastery of carnal pleasure that has a lingering quality in the transnational imaginary. In this essay I will consider the convergence of absence and omnipresence on the bodies of two women associated with slavery and freedom, sexuality and sin. The desire to situate these women as visual figures absented of the physical effects of slavery also works to make barren the literal body colonies that necessarily produced themselves innumerable times over. After all, what is a slave history without its production, counterproduction, and reproduction? I am interested in the cultural insistence of overt sexuality, and the way this insistence works toward an understanding of the slave woman's body as necessarily dis tinct from her maternal body, imagined with the power to destroy pow erful men using the weapons of her body. The concept of the slave-maternal is indicative of patterns of white male access and owner ship, patterns that compel the slave woman's body to work toward its own ideological hyperfreedom even as it is physically reversed upon itself. The static cohesion of symbol and rhetoric formulate a revolving circle of negation bound through the chromosomal legacies of masters and slaves. This is the contradictory point at which we find ourselves face to face with the slave woman's particular conundrum and Hem ings's and Suva's relationship to corporeal memory, to historical endeavor. What will occur here is an investigation into the fixations of omission and an examination of the dangerous ground cultures tread upon in using the bodies of others." THE FIGURATIVE AUCTION BLOCK: SALLY HEMINGS AND CONTEMPORARY MEMORY Sally Hemings's final resting place, according to a recent news report, is "likely under a new Hampton Inn and its parking lot" in Charlottesville, Virginia, four miles from Monticello (Cauchon 1999). The sudden and furious interest in her corporeal whereabouts (post-DNA findings) has all the markings of the former hypervisible/invisible treatment Hemings encountered while she lived as one of Thomas Jefferson's two hundred slaves on the grounds of Monticello. We know her only through rumor, deduction, and the cataloging of Jefferson's notes, methodically marking each of her births. In the present moment, nearly two hundred years after her death, she is a veritable industry of memory. In Virginia, a pro posal is under way to name a street "in her honor" (Clines 2000); a</page><page sequence="3">BROWN 47 Lexington, Kentucky, racehorse owner is suing to retain the name Sally Hemings for his thoroughbred ("Horse owner sues," 2005); and a 1970 radical newsletter emerging from the University of Virginia named itself, in an ironic play on the use of voice, the Sally Hemings (Sally Flem ings, 2005). In her present reincarnation, Sally Hemings is not simply the prop erty of Thomas Jefferson, but symbolizes the nation's incestuous enslaved/free intermingling as well as our continued fascination with political figures. Corporeally tied to three generations of white paterni ty, Hemings is assumed to be the half sister of Jefferson's wife, Martha; it is believed that Hemings and Mrs. Jefferson had the same father, John Wayles. Wayles purchased an African woman from a Captain Hemings, for whom the slave woman had already given birth to a daughter, Eliza beth, or Betty, Hemings. Betty Hemings gave birth to multiple children both paternally and legally belonging to Wayles, completing the popular cycle of regenerative and sexual possession so important to slaveholding men of means. Whether sexual exploitation takes the form of consent, coercion, rape, or "seduction," New World slavery afforded slave owners such as Wayles and Jefferson unparalleled access to black women's bodies. The resultant power dynamic was not accidental; instead plantation owners used all tools at their disposal to ensure their continuing dominion over all things chattel and worth possessing. These slaveholders, according to Walter Johnson, "sought victims, not companions. In their most private moments, these men existed only in the slaves whose bodies provided the register for their secret desires and their evident power" (W. John son 1999, 15). To sustain this power and erode it of guilt, the slaveocracy established a set rhetoric that delineated the purpose and position of slave women's unfree bodies. Johnson continues: "Behind the shroud of patriarchal prerogative, some slaveholders hid fantasies of domination that could be seen only by their slaves. . . . [B]y hiding their private desires from everyone but their slaves, they recapitulated the ultimate logic of the slave market: their phantasms of independent agency were built out of practical dependence upon people bought in the market? their selves were built out of their slaves" (115). Purchased in the slave market to a total stranger, or, in the case of Sally Hemings, inherited as the known product of previous sexual inter ference, a slave woman, as bell hooks reminds us, "could not look to any</page><page sequence="4">48 BLACK RAPTURE group of men, white or black, to protect her against sexual exploita tion" (1981, 36). "Half-white children in southern households," accord ing to Deborah Gray White, "told a story of a white man's infidelity, a slave woman's helplessness . . . and a white woman's inability to defy the social and legal constraints that kept her bound to her husband regard less of his transgressions" (1999, 40). And so it was this rarely acknowl edged series of repetitive relationships, played out on the bodies of black women, that, if unearthed and deconstructed, would be the backstory to the construction of a new nation. The quintessential "marked woman," who, according to Hortense Spillers, is imbued with so much "mythical prepossession that there is no easy way for the agents buried beneath them to come clean" (1987, 65), is embodied in the memory of Sally Hemings. Barbara Chase-Riboud, in her popular 1979 novel, Sally Hemings, attempted to reintroduce the for mer folkloric figure to a wider audience. Of the several book jackets that provided visual representation of Hemings, one stands out (see Fig. 1). In a close-up shot, a woman's neck and bosom is laced with an open locket that sits firmly between the left and right breast of the figure and is opened to a photograph of a young Thomas Jefferson. The image exists both in- and outside time, flirting with the repetitive nature of black woman's imagery. The locket functions as a miniature oval daguerreotype, a priceless keepsake from a loved one, but precedes the era of daguerreotypes by fifty years. The colorful detail of the image, understood as a painting, assumed to be a painting, is close cropped and cut like a photograph. Straddling three imagistic portrayals?artistic painting, documentary photograph, and erotica?the cover art eliminates Hemings's gaze by cutting her head and face off at the neck, leaving the viewer with only her breasts, her desire, and her powerful lover to contemplate. The visual decapitation alters Hemings's slave/seducer sin gularity and Offers her fig ure an Fig 1. Book cover 5.//yHemm^ by &amp; 7 &amp; Barbara Chase-Riboud (Harper anonymity, which renders the reality Collins, 1980).</page><page sequence="5">BROWN 49 of a slave woman's sexual unprotection a more frightening duality. As the visual imitation of the cover of a romance novel, the image also makes small (literally miniscule) Jefferson's participation in a scan dal with which he has been publicly associated since 1802. The locket represents an intense love on Hemings's part, while the cleavage is a window into the slave woman's sexual capabilities and appetite. Her bosom, ample and fecund, is there for the benefit of Mr. Jefferson, and indeed, can even be imagined as providing a home for his legacy. The taut neck makes visual an eagerness already assumed in the historical memory. With the figure sporting a pale yellow dress with a small matching flower attached at the center o? the bodice, the split seam opening like a curtain on Hemings's represented sexual prowess, the image is larger than the borders of the novel it accompanies and is an illusory power play of tremendous proportion. Similarly, Cyrus Cassells's 1983 poem takes the Sally Hemings sexu al power play to new heights.4 "Sally Hemings to Thomas Jefferson" appeared in the literary journal Callaloo and was dedicated thus: "For Barbara Chase-Riboud and for my family, reputed to be the direct descendants of Hemings and Jefferson." Placing the origins of Cassell's lineage squarely between the famous slave woman and her more famous owner, the poem anticipates the outward victimization of Hemings with its first line, "je m'appele Sally," an introduction that first situates Hem ings in the realm of the named, the counted, the recorded, then places her memory within a Europeanized learned category of French lessons, eager student to Jefferson's requested tutelage. "Now, years later," she tells us, "I repeat the French, / As if to yield / All that I am, / And open the locket to find, / Cached in the tiny, gold-lined womb, / A lock of your red hair: / It happens, your face / Looms again in my lifetime" (Cassells 1983, 1). As narrator and agent, Sally Hemings, silenced by his tory, endeavors to speak for herself, claim that which is close to her heart and her consciousness, and is given a voice to do just that. If I could go to the doorway, And stand, waiting for you As you take the hall, your leonine figure Assembling in the longest mirror As in my eyes. But you are dead, Thomas Jelferson,</page><page sequence="6">50 BLACK RAPTURE And I can only sit, Motionless, my heart pounding At your phantam, For today I learned The census-taker made me white To absolve you of the crime Of having loved a slavewoman. So I burned our correspondence ?The diaries and billet-doux an ash Clinging to my skirts, A smoke in my hair. Each word A swatch of myself, a forbidden history: The Hotel de Langeac, the Palace of Marly, The Capital, Monticello? Now I am robbed of everything, Even of my color. (1-2) Cassells creates an image of Hemings etched in the elegant, love-struck, duty-filled existence that has become historical memory. At once dwelling on the memory of Jefferson as lover, Hemings, "made white" by the census taker, enacts her agency on the page by burning the billet doux, the love letters passed between the two over the years. Where there is a crime committed by Jefferson, Hemings as speaker releases the former president of fault and it becomes the census taker's desire "to absolve you of the crime / of having loved a slavewoman," by marking the elderly Hemings as white instead of black, which is seen as the true crime. The poem, a long narrative construct of 119 lines broken into five stanzas, travels backward from Hemings's spoken present back through her infamous past. But it is the second stanza that makes the complexi ties of their union expressive and explicit. I was fifteen when you took me, Your daughter's nursemaid; You brushed my cheek With your red-plumed chest, Whispering Martha, Martha ?Piercing me with the name Of your dead wife, my white half-sister</page><page sequence="7">BROWN 51 Whom I resembled. I was so frightened by you then, So overawed and unbelieving Of your love. I would stand before my mirror, Cupping my breasts In my two hands, amazed: no fledgling But a woman? Je t'aime, Sally, Je t'aime, I heard you say, And in Paris I mislaid My slavery So home to Monticello, I met My mother's loving, though accusatory face, And knew I should have chosen freedom. (2) In this poem, crafted to be a sympathetic portrayal of the complex "relationship" Jefferson and Hemings shared, the speaker addresses some of the more troubling aspects of the power dynamic. "I was fifteen when you took me," Sally confesses. Using "took" to connote a momentary lack of volition and signaling age and level of maturity, the stanza reit erates the facts of the oral and historical record, and then quickly moves into the more intimate interiors of a problematic coupling. Against the backdrop of Hemings's primary dilemma, there is the founding of a new nation: The battlecries, Your glittering words o? revolution Have been recorded, But in a secret wing of Monticello, Against your will, I marked The dreams and follies of our seven children, The shocked faces of our foreign guests. But O what I could not capture Was your silence As all the country crowned me Black Lillith, Sooty Chatelaine. (2)</page><page sequence="8">52 BLACK RAPTURE In these lines Cassells contains Hemings's "love" for Jefferson within the arena of a lifetime of physical desire and maternal production. Yet this portion of the poem also releases the third president of his paternal responsibility, instead listing Hemings as a woman devoid of paternity, situating her in the realm of the slave-maternal (a known mother, and an unknown or unacknowledged father). "Against your will," she says, "I marked the dreams and follies of our seven children" (emphasis mine). Her attempt to make legible the existence of both herself and the children she produced with Jefferson disrupts its own insistence. Absence here relinquishes memory and provides the reader with a rela tionship that spanned Hemings's adult life, but prosaically failed to reproduce itself into the historical record, thereby making it an anom aly situated within the slave woman's body. As Hortense Spillers asserts, "This body whose flesh carries the female and the male to the frontiers of survival bears in person the marks of a cultural text whose inside has been turned outside" (1987, 67). This inside/ outsidedness facili tates Hemings's immersion into cultural lore, with body and without child, without a past of white paternity, which, while rhetorically nec essary, is historically dangerous.1 Cassells's poem, dedicated to Chase-Riboud and referencing her novel, stresses some of the more romantic aspects of the fictional work. Chase-Riboud (1979), a visual artist eager to author a historical novel bearing such a provocative subject, began working on the book, which would bring her additional fame, this time as a writer of fiction. The novel, dedicated "to the enigma of the historical Sally Hemings," begins with the same census taker noted later in Cassells's work. The fictional eager patriot who rewrites the documentation concerning Hemings and her grown sons, Nathan Langdon is drawn in by Hemings's beauty and allure and repeatedly returns to her cabin to spend time with her. Set ting off a flood of memory, Langdon's visits are welcome until he reveals to Hemings his "decision" to whiten up Hemings and her sons by marking their race as white in the census record. Hemings responds by burning all correspondence between Jefferson and herself, the only written proof of their relationship. Her memories, though, do not burn.6 When Hemings recalls her journey to Paris as the servant of Jeffer son's known and acknowledged daughter, years previous, she remem bers that it was a happy time for her. Jefferson, whom she most often refers to as "master," quickly "sought his slave's company more and</page><page sequence="9">BROWN 53 more" and "indulged her as a child rather than a servant" (Chase-Riboud 1979, 92). Reaching back into the memory of their first sexual encounter, Hemings admits, "Perhaps I had always known he would claim me. Had not the same happened to my mother and sister?" Hemings, speaking in the first person, initially treats her impending sexual relationship with Jefferson as "a thing that happens." She is the slave body happened upon, a destiny she can do nothing about, only wait. "I could hasten or delay that moment" she tells us, "but I felt powerless to prevent it." Hemings's adolescent lust for her master takes over her body as she waits for Jeffer son to approach her or give her some sort of signal that he desires her in the same way. "I dared not leave the house lest he send for me. At night I fell asleep sitting upright on the side of my bed." The evening before Jefferson is scheduled to go to Amsterdam for six weeks, he sends for Hemings, but fails to appear to tell her what he wants. She falls asleep in his bedroom, awaking to his "immense shadow" materializing in front of her. I had no idea how long he had been standing there. Now that he had come, I felt no fear, only an overwhelming tenderness. His presence for me was command enough; I took control of him. I bent forward and pressed a kiss on the trembling hands that encompassed mine, and the contact of my lips with his flesh was so violent that I lost all memory of what came afterward. I felt around me an exploding flower, not just of passion, but of long deprivation, a hunger for things forbidden, for darkness and unreason, the passion of rage against the death of the other I so resembled. For in this moment I became one with her, and it was not my name that sprang from him, but that of my half sis ter. (Chase-Riboud 1979, 99-102) The initial and violently passionate sexual encounter between master and slave is initiated, naturally, by the slave?reiterating the oft-told story of slave lust, impossible to contain and impossible to resist. And so Thomas Jefferson does not resist. He is the one who trembles, is ambiva lent and awestruck, and Hemings is the "exploding flower" of "passion," "long deprivation" and the seeker of "things forbidden." In this moment of carnal magnetism, Sally Hemings becomes, in Hartman's words, the "master of her own subjection," willing agent to a relationship she</page><page sequence="10">54 BLACK RAPTURE herself pursues (Hartman 1997). As a man mesmerized and hypnotized, Jefferson falls into her, using her body as an opportunity to revisit his dead wife's flesh. The narration portrays Jefferson as a weakened, torn, and unsure middle-aged American minister distantly recognizable as the architect of Monticello, the founder of the University of Virginia, the author of the Declaration of Independence, and the future president of the United States. His ability to see Hemings at one moment as a child whom he "indulged," and at the next moment as his sexual superior (nine months younger than his own daughter), solidifies her sexual maturity even as a fifteen-year-old virgin. Hemings renders her enslavement in perpetual terms: "Nothing would ever free me of him" (Chase-Riboud 1979, 103). She owns up to her servitude to Jefferson, body and womb, allowing him the luxury of powerlessness. The conflation of child and woman imagined by Chase-Riboud adds to the incestuous element that was plantation slave life. Father, lover, master, owner?the roles are not easily classified and demarcated; and they fail to disappear cleanly into contemporary memory. Hemings has an immense responsibility in the text, written to navigate the borders of a "love story," which is as scandalous today as it was in the late eigh teenth century. Historians and image producers alike have needed the narrative safety o? a Hemings-initiated sexual liaison, even as it rings with the familiar desire of a guilt-inflicted national narrative. "Sally Hemings to Thomas Jefferson" can only be read through the clouded lenses of a reimagined historical memory. In twenty-one lines of verse, Hemings as narrator moves though no less than nine temporary and permanent identities. Beginning as an impressionable child, to a "taken" victim, an enslaved subject and sexual replacement for a dead wife, she, the quadroon sister of Martha Jefferson, is corporeal proof of previous sexual abuse, but also the image of emergent sexual desire and power. She is, as she professes, "a woman," a worldly woman of French tutelage, hearing "Je t'aime" spoken to her, a profession of love in the language of love, and she also believes she is this?loved. By the end o? this stanza, reality returns to Hemings's consciousness and she realizes that her fate is one that she chose for herself, the "my slavery" she refers to, and as she does, the fantasy fades, settling on her memory of the "lov ing, though accusatory face" of her enslaved mother, Elizabeth Hem ings, and ending on the one thing denied her even upon Jefferson's</page><page sequence="11">BROWN 55 death?freedom. The poem consistently paints Hemings, slave woman and survivor, as the emotional superior of the two, an unfree confidant who could harbor Jefferson's secret desires within her own body and ease his psyche of its own culpability. "I looked into your eyes" she says, "two sapphires / set in a human face / and met a suffering so vast, what else / But to take your hand": And whisper, Yes . . . My love and master, I need to believe I would choose this way again, Though as property I had no choice 'Cept to give myself But I, Mademoiselle Sally, Gave you my heart, And returned to slavery. Nothing could free me from you. (Cassells 1983, 3-4) In his poem, Cassells attempts quite the difficult task of humanizing both Hemings and Jefferson. As readers of the poem we are implicated in Hemings's dilemma, though she absolves even us of our historical complicity. "I need to believe," she tells us, "I would choose this way again." In this sense, she reprises her role as sacrificial center to an ever-evolving psychosexual historical narrative. It is not only she who needs to believe. To invoke Hortense Spillers once again, Sally Hem ings's country needs her, and if she didn't exist, she would have to be invented. Such is the fate of this slave woman in relation to cultural memory. She existed, and we invented her anyway. CHICA DA SILVA AND THE SEDUCTION'S HISTORICAL RE-CREATION According to J?nia Ferreira Furtado, Francisca "Chica" da Silva, "born between 1731 and 1735, was the child of Maria de Costa, a black slave and Antonio Caetano de S?, a white man" (Furtado 2003, 47).7 Much like her North American counterpart Sally Hemings, Silva was born into a legacy of paternal whiteness, situating her biraciality as a marker of pre vious abuses, while her mother's blackness signified her availability for present and future use. Because Silva appears to have attained a larger</page><page sequence="12">56 BLACK RAPTURE measure of power through her sexual relationship with her owner, the underside of the dynamic of slave negotiations and desires are even more complicated and multilayered. Silva was the slave, and later mistress, of Jo?o Fernandes de Oliveira, a diamond contractor from Portugal who purchased the slave woman in 1753 (Furtado 2003, 103). Silva gave birth to thirteen children in her first fifteen years with Oliveira, spending almost her entire adult life pregnant. In fact, when Silva and Oliveira meet, she has already had a child for her then master, Manuel Pires Sardinha, her body already illustrating a wealth of possibility for Oliveira. Historical memory concerning Silva is fickle, culturally self conscious, and inventive, crediting the former slave woman with possess ing otherworldly mystical powers of seduction. In this narrative, Jo?o Fernandes is the one without the power to control his body and becomes a slave in his own home as Silva is remembered as a woman who cast her sexual spell on everyone she encountered. The unstable relationship Silva had with the town of Arrail do Tijuco results, in part, from the sways of the historical record. Of the subject of her biographical study, Furtado wonders: "Witch, seducer, heroine, queen or slave: after all, who was Chica da Silva[?]: After almost three centuries, the lack of historical research on her life contributes to the questions remaining about her" (19).8 Even though Furtado's study is the first full-length work to concern this central figure of Brazilian historiography, Silva has remained a vital part of the national narrative of resistance, power, and multiracial reproduction. In his 1946 publication Casa Grande and Senzala, or The Masters and the Slaves, Gilberto Freyre outlines the structure of the social world Silva was born into. Racial hegemony and sexual exploitation as a birthright, Freyre would argue, contributes happily to the colorful blending of the Brazilian familial landscape. And the sexualized black woman, from antiquity to the present, has been the foremost contributing factor to the racial mixture presently noticeable. Freyre illustrates the sexual excess of the slave woman through an anecdote concerning the marital norms of a particular white Brazilian man in power. "It was necessary for this youth," he tells us "in order to excite his white bride, to take with him to the bedroom the sweaty nightgown, imbued with the budum, or odor, o? the Negro slave girl with whom he had been having an affair" (Freyre 1946, 278). In Freyre's estimation, it is this connectivity to base</page><page sequence="13">BROWN 57 sexual desire that explains the particularity of sexual mores Brazil has to offer. Speaking in the collective voice, Freyre begins his chapter "The Negro Slave in the Sexual and Family Life of the Brazilian" with an affectionate dedication. He situates "the mulatto girl . . . who initiated us into physical love and, to the creaking of a canvas cot, gave us our first complete sensation of being a man" (278) as the epitome of sexual experience, for which all white men are grateful. The concept of sexual initiation and innocence, exuding from the pale body of the white Brazilian (male) and made sensual by the baser primitive "gifts" of the "Negro slave girl," has a direct connection to this specific Brazilian nar rative of wild and wanton sexuality. Between a "slave girl" and her mulatto child there stands an invisi ble white presence, underarticulated, but fully understood as an essential part of the miscegenation equation. The conglomeration of what Saidiya Hartman calls "socially tolerable and necessary violence" that "sets the stage for the indiscriminate use of the body for pleasure, profit and pun ishment" (1997, 85) is located outside the slave woman's acknowledged experience. Through the interiors of an unacknowledged experience, though, we can carefully pull together the beaded strings of a circular narrative history, one in which slave women's bodies are sexually engendered to give the illusion of volition, a needful thing to an oppres sive slaveocracy. In addition to sexual access, there is the promise of its other benefit?offspring; the kind that signify another kind of physical growth and meaning. According to Walter Johnson, male bodies pur chased during slavery were objectified for present and future use; women had the additional marker of eternal replenishing through their bodies to contend with. Their use was seen as never ending?everlast ing. And the sexual access of plantation slave systems allowed for the proliferation of mulatto progeny that "existed in a state of public era sure" (W.Johnson 1999, 115). For Chica da Silva, born into this lineage of known mothers and unknown fathers in Minas Gerais, nearly two hundred years of imperial ist possession of Brazil had already taken place, and by the late sixteenth century, the Portuguese had control. According to Robin Blackburn, "Brazil wood, from which red dye could be extracted, gave the colony its name and remained the principal product for nearly half a century" (1997, 163). By the early eighteenth century, the "precious metals" the Portuguese were in search of were discovered; gold was found in cities</page><page sequence="14">58 BLACK RAPTURE such as Ouro Preto, and diamonds in Arrail do Tijuco (present-day Dia mantina in the state of Mina Gerais). The interconnectedness of sexual exploitation and economic gain, coupled with the extra surge of power engendered by the wholesale ownership of another, was too enticing for slave masters to relinquish or resist. Jennifer L. Morgan in Laboring Women argues that "the relation ship between production and reproduction was fraught with violence and the threat of familial disruption" for slave women; "colonial slave codes were universally concerned with regulating the movements of the enslaved" (2004, 122, 167). These "movements," corporeally rendered, would mean that the relationship between sexual exploitation and reproduction could widen and could alter a slave woman's context within the system. Alongside the fear of a possible "free black womb" there were concerns about how the womb would materialize and affect the nation's future?its citizens' repetitive entitlements to slave bodies.9 The intertwining of sexual access and labor, of production and reproduction, lingered in the transnational imaginary long after slav ery's demise. The construction of the mythology of sexual supremacy is a vestige of the past revisited on the present and repeated, as if there had been no negotiation, no recognition of the ways exploitation functions. One of the many ways this exploitation survives presently is through the artistic emphasis on the uncontrolled/contained sexual power of enslaved female bodies. Carlos Diegues's film Xica (1976) participates in the imbrication of hypersexual enslaved female bodies while satirically portraying the inner workings of imperialism and desire in the context of eighteenth century Brazil. The film plays with the limits of representation and reclamation, and it was tremendously successful in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America?later spawning a telenovela, which was also highly r i io successful. Xica begins in the lush, virginal fields of Minas Gerais, outside Villa Rica, where the magistrate from Portugal is on his way to the city's cen ter to take over control of the diamond mines. In these initial few shots of the film, we find out many things about Oliveira (played by Walmor Chagas) just by looking at him. He is wealthy, garbed in the fabric of a man of leisure and luxury. He is clearly a man of status; his economic power precedes him. Yet he is also a man of the people, for he stops along the way to Arrail do Tijuco to partake in a colonial musical</page><page sequence="15">BROWN 59 retreat, playing the flute with such skill that it immediately impresses the transient musicians he meets along the way. Intrigued and eager to take on the task he has been assigned, Oliveira says that he believes his destiny is located within the city limits. Since the very next shot is our introductory image of the body of Xica (Zez? Motta), bent, squatting, and viewed from behind, it is clear in the narrative that his destiny is tied to her sexuality. Laura Mulvey argues in Visual and Other Pleasures that cinema is uniquely qualified to precipitate the repetition of visual subjugation and objectification: "The cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking, but it also goes further." Allowing "the erotic basis for pleasure in looking at another person as object," film is a layered enabler, stream lining the distance between symbol and representation. "The conven tions of mainstream film focus attention on the human form. Scale, space, stories are all anthropomorphic. Here, curiosity and the wish to look intermingle with a fascination with likeness and recognition: the human face, the human body, the relationship between the human form and its surroundings, the visible presence of the person in the world" (1989, 17). The visual presence of a black woman's body contained with in the slave system has a similar effect. She is the unfree body made free through a process of visual recognition and interdependence upon his torical memory.11 When we are first allowed to gaze and linger on Xica's body (as unfree), she is shown kneeling on the ground outside the home she takes care of, shucking corn as chickens scurry about around her. Jos? (Stepan Nercessian), the young son of Xica's owner, the master sergeant of Tiju co, emerges from the second level of the house and walks along the rail ing, repeatedly belting out the slave woman's name in song. Half strutting along the pathway, Jos? uses playful gestures that are nonethe less a measure of his entitlement to her body. Xica slowly stands, her back facing the viewer, and places her hands on her hips, turning swiftly to face her taunting master as she refuses him verbally. Jos? emerges from the higher level of the home and begins his approach down the stairs, juxtaposing his higher status and desire, while at the same time delineating the depths of his lust and the way in which he is willing to physically "lower himself to be with the slave woman. Jos? races toward Xica, kneeling down and grabbing her from behind. He quickly and playfully rips the top of her loosely-fitting blouse to expose her bare</page><page sequence="16">60 BLACK RAPTURE breasts. Xica struggles against him at first, quickly covering her breasts, her face a mixture of fear and anger. Then a smile slowly rises on her face and she joyfully darts off into the cellar beneath the house, shrieking as she goes. Jos? follows her, gleeful, about to receive his body's delights. After a few moments in the dark cellar of the domicile, the young man locates the playful slave. Viewers are only privy to the audi tory exchange between Xica and Jos? and it is in this space where Xica's particular sexual talents are introduced to moviegoers as Jos? is over come by the sheer force of her sexual strength. This strength is never visually rendered, but is intended to be fully understood as Xica's special and unique talent. At the same moment, Jos?'s father, the sergeant major/governor (Rodolfo Arena), is entertaining the newly arrived intendant, Theodoro (Altair Lima), and his wife, Dona Hortensia (Elke Maravilha). While the three of them prepare for Jo?o Fernandes's anticipated arrival, the governor calls for his house slave, and the site of her enslavement is visu ally contrasted by the intendant Theodoro and his wife, both of whom are dressed in the excesses of imperial power. Dona Hortensia is garbed lavishly in a red dress and is sampling from a platter of raspberries, signi fying the bounty of Tijuco as well as her association to sexuality and desire. Although she does not eat an apple, she is visually guilty of sexual curiosity. Dona Hortensia, white and entitled, is a figure portrayed in contradiction to her prestige and position within Tijuco. Xica is the slave, but it is Dona Hortensia who attempts to enact her base desires throughout the film. Like Xica, she is viewed as enamored by power? men in power?but unlike Xica, she is bound by the sexual mores of her race and class. She is enslaved by the social discourse of her "feminine position," the "cult of true womanhood" Xica can never aspire to. Xica has no such feminine position, although it is her race, gender, and slave status that situates her body as both with and without power. The slave woman emerges in the scene, followed quickly by Jos?, and as Xica and Jos? stand in the doorway, Intendant Theodoro's attention is instantly drawn toward Xica. The intendant is sexually attracted to Xica (or her position as a slave with no right to refuse him) and fixes his eyes in her direction. We do not know whether or not Xica returns the gaze, and the movie makes it clear that her desire is not as dominant as Theodoro's in the scene. At the same moment that Theodoro is pleasur ing his internal fantasies with visions of Xica's body, his wife makes her</page><page sequence="17">BROWN 61 way over to Jos?. Xica enters the room more fully, existing outside the frame, which now consists of Jos?, Theodoro, and Dona Hortensia. The two men fix their eyes on Xica. Dona Hortensia, meanwhile, focuses her attentions on an actively disinterested Jos?. Dona Hortensia is seen as sexually intrigued and stifled at the same time, one hand placed mas terbatorally over her vaginal area while she eats raspberries with her right hand. She is clearly aching for sexual attention, but is disregarded by both white men in favor of Xica. Theodoro addresses his curiosity? sexual and patriarchal?to Jos?. "Since when is she your father's slave?" he asks the governor's son. "I don't know," Jos? responds. "Ever since she was a child, I guess." Having situated her as a domestic and domesti cated enslaved woman, one who would certainly know the ways of the slave body unprotected, Jos? and Theodoro look over at Xica once again, envisioning their needs played out on her body as Hortensia looks on, unpleased, but also, unsurprised. His wife's displeasure aside, the intendant strolls over to Xica and makes a counterclockwise half circle around her. He eyes his prey, smiling satisfactorily. "A good piece, this Xica, isn't she?" Itching to wield his power and importance around Tijuco and possi bly humiliate the wife who is unable to do the same, Theodoro calls Xica over to him, as Jos? posits, "You like her, don't you?" This obvious reference to the intendant 's lustful desire and the intended location of this lust unsettles him. White male access to slave women is a thing whispered and negotiated, a thing mentioned in polite company only by those of the inner circle. Nonetheless, Theodoro checks Xica's teeth, shoulders, and arms and finally grabs and squeezes her breasts, declaring, "Not much meat, but she's good . . . for certain things." In a repetition of the auction block, the intendant surveys his future prey for her physi cal stamina and her body's resources. Dona Hortensia, visually absent during this scene, shifts out of the frame as the shots shift back and forth from Theodoro and Xica to Jos?. Even in her imagistic absence, Dona Hortensia's body functions as a haunting, drifting in and out of the frame's point of view to remind the viewers of the contained (and yet vibrantly exploding) sexuality of white women. It is Xica's dark complexion, contrasted with the dainty whiteness of Dona Hortensia, that works to visually compel and intrigue the viewer. Dona Hortensia is not only pale in complexion, she is blonde?lighter than everyone she encounters?while Xica is seen as</page><page sequence="18">62 BLACK RAPTURE sturdy, black, and solid; perfect for penetration and exploitation. And yet this penetration works filmically from Xica outward, as it is Xica who possesses the symbolic phallus, and the men she conquers are unable to even measure up. The movie spans Oliveira's time in Brazil to the point of his forced return to Portugal, but absents itself of the more than dozen Silva/Oliveira offspring who would have visually altered Xica's movements and renderings for the viewer. It is possible that Diegues felt that the sight of multiple quadroon children would be a visual disruption and an unnecessary element for the progression of the narrative. It is also possible, I would argue, that this compelling omission imagistically engenders an impregnable version of Silva where every sexual act, every physical gesture, slides off her body like liquid and disappears into cultural folklore. This is what she shares with Sally Hemings?partici pation in a phallic fantasy with visual reward and no repercussions. Much as with the Cassells's poem, one can imagine that Silva would choose just as forcefully as she seems to in the film, allowing the view er's gaze to enter and engender?empowered by the narrative. Diegues's film allows the spectator to slowly recognize Xica's sexual powers one unsuspecting man at a time. She is the only one in the film who seems to have total control of both her sexuality and the sexual plea sures of the multiple men she comes into contact with. When the film opens, the viewer is invited to see Xica and Jos? as playful lovers, monog amous and troubled by their problematic coupling. After a few moments, the viewer's comfort in this fantasy is disrupted by the screams of sexual extreme belted out by Jos?, and later the advances of Theodoro. It is only Xica, then?slave to both the governor and his son (and later sold to Jo?o Fernandes)?who is seen as the victor of this historical fable. Carl Degler notes that in the state of Minas Gerais, where Diamanti na is located, "the lack of women was felt so keenly that the government in 1732 prohibited white women from leaving Brazil for Portugal" (1971, 228). Willing to force white women to remain in Brazil whether they wanted to or not, while simultaneously exploiting the physical and sexual labors of black female slaves, Portuguese authority figures, slave masters, and arbitrary white men found ways to force themselves, again, literally and figuratively on the bodies of black women (and white women) and make a world out of their own desires; inextricably linking black women's sexuality to the failed resistance white men supposedly attempt ed and blurring the boundaries between exploitation and volition.</page><page sequence="19">BROWN 63 BODY COMMODITIES Ultimately for both these historical icons o? slavery and freedom, there continues to be both a utilizing and an extending of the ideology of sex ual power so necessary to the plantation imagination. The legacy of sex ual supremacy and memory, historical amnesia and erasure, cultural avoidance and hyperpresence, have all contributed to Hemings's and Suva's contested relationship to representation. They are but two instances of a larger, repetitive trend, regenerative and resistant to new modes of interpretation. Chica da Silva and Sally Hemings represent the binary opposition so unique to the systems of slavery they existed within. They were black and white, child and woman, slave and free, gendered and ungendered, absent and ever present. Slavery's sexual mythology, the lingering shadow of desire and availability, is inscribed on black women's present bodies and read like a familiar text long in existence. As the epigraphs intimate, historical linkages are imbued with the violence of the past. Literary and visual representations of slave women's bodies illustrate the contemporary denial nations are so adamantly in need of protecting, and the conversation, long overdue, we do not want to have with ourselves.

Paula Giddings writes that in the case of the early American colonies, black women arrived on slave ships already presupposed with sexual powers. "Black women?described by English slave traders as "hot constitution'd ladies, possessed of a 'lascivious temper,' who had an inclination for White men"?would not get many opportunities to articulate desires that ran counter to collective white needs (1984,35). 2. Patricia Hopkins's 2002 dissertation for the University of Pennsylvania explores the discourse of silence surrounding black women's experiences as rape victims from slavery through contemporary debates about the "unrapeability" of black women's bodies (particularly intraracial rape) in African American cultural contexts. 3. This was the only version of paternal indecency that most historians were willing to accept (Wayles bad, Jefferson good) before the 1998 DNA findings con nected Jefferson to Hemings through her descendants. Lucia Stanton and Ann duCille write about the link between oral history and denial so pervasive in the his torical record concerning Jefferson and Hemings. 4. Extensive quotation of this poem used by permission of Johns Hopkins. 5. In documenting the recent historical re-creation (post-DNA) of the Jefferson Hemings connection, historians, famous as well as burgeoning, have seemingly all read and borrowed heavily from the biblical text of founding nationhood. About Sally Hemings, though, there is only this: an absence of abuse, a presence of agency and the peculiar, yet mild distrust of forensic investigation. If it did happen, and no one will say without multiple qualifiers that it did, then theirs was a tragic romance, affected by the times and cultural traditions of the slaveholding South and complex to a point that covers all manner of sin and accountability. 6. It is telling that Jefferson's letters, the very archival objects used by historians to prove that the third president of the United States "could never" have had any sexual relations with one of his slaves, is used in the novel as yet another instance of the imperfection of the written record, as well as evidence of Hemings's autonomy. Her agency is illustrated when she burns the letters with her own hand and takes possession of this particular aspect of the historical record. 7. I use the official spelling of Suva's first name, "Chica," when referring to the historical figure. I use the more colloquial spelling, "Xica," when referring to Diegues's movie bearing that spelling of her name. Furtado's text reads: "Nascida entre 1731 e 1735, era filha de Maria da Costa, escrava negra, e de Antonio Caeitano de S?, h?rnern branco" (translation mine). 8. The passage reads: "Bruxa, sedutora, heroinha ou escrava: afinal, quern era Chica da Silva: Ap?s quase tres s?culos, a falta de urna pesquisa hist?rica sobre sua vida contribui para que a pergunta premanecesse sem reposta efetiva" (translation mine). 9. In Rio de Janeiro, an 1871 "Free Womb" law conceptualized just how prob lematic the legal negotiation of the slave mother was for slave owners and officials. According to Martha Abreu, the hotly contested debate about the impending bill</page><page sequence="21">BROWN 65 ensuring the freedom of a slave woman's offspring was closely connected to white men's rights as multidimensional oppressors. The law "jeopardized an even more effective means of control over slaves . . . the control over their families and future children, who, once the law was ratified, would be born free (ingenuos) forever after" (Abreu 1996, 571). 10. O. Hugo Benavides's article "Seeing Xica and the Melodramatic Unveiling of Colonial Desire" examines the phenomenon of the telenovela within the context of sexuality, history, and difference. In his probing examination of the vicissitudes of race and power through a theoretical reading of the telenovela, Benavides is inter ested in "the problematics of postcoloniality throughout Latin America." 11. In his 1980 review of the film, critic Randal Johnson claims that, for Xica, "in addition to being an object of the desire of the most powerful men in the village, she is also an acting subject in relationship to them. There are many indications that she, not her partners, controls and determines the sexual relationships she maintains. Diegues seems to be saying that even though she has no economic, military or politi cal power, she exercises the power of Eros, erotic power. There is, however, some thing fundamentally sexist about this characterization. . . . [A]s a slave, she is not free to say no. . . . [S]he is used as a sexual object. Her unique sexual ability is her oppression." WORKS CITED Abreu, Martha. 1996.
