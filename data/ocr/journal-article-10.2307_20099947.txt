Springer 2006 DOI 10.1007/sl 1212-006-9004-5 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER WHAT IS CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE? ABSTRACT. Mamardasvili's 'classical' paradigm of knowledge is seen to be minimally based on extrapolations from Descartes' classical philosophy to which Mamardasvili attributes features that rather anticipate his own post-classical ontology. The latter is oriented towards the primacy of per ception as a subjective process, in which the self-conscious subject constructs the world, not as illusion, but as a 'picture' or 'model' (Wittgenstein's Bild). By examining Mamardasvili's definition of the 'phenomenon' against the background of Husserl's 'reduction', Wittgenstein's 'object' and the Freudian and post-structuralist psychoanalytic model of subjectivity, the paper arrives at the inference that Mamardasvili is essentially a post Structuralist thinker who appropriates concepts from various critical and philosophical disciplines to construct his own multi-disciplinary theory of consciousness and perception. KEY WORDS: cogitai knowledge, event of consciousness, discontinuity, transformation, world in progress, phenomenological shift (sdvig), phe nomenological reduction, chronotopic object, expressivity of states, hyste ria, the unrepresentable, quasi-organs, the phenomenon, models In his lucid overview of Merab Mamardasvili's classical and non-classical modes of thought, Vladimir Kalinicenko identifies the central question which preoccupied Mamardasvili in the text Klassiceskie i neklassiceskie idealy racionaVnosti [Classical and Non-Classical Ideals of Rationality].1 This is the question of consciousness inflected as the question of knowledge. It is the question of "What can I know?"2 In the critical literature on Mamardasvili's thought, the question of the relation of Mamardasvili's conception of non-classical rationality to modern phenomenology (of Husserl, in the first place) has been broached on particular points. Nelli Motrosilova, for example, examines the construction of the</page><page sequence="2">206 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER 'transcendental ego' in Husserl's and Mamardasvili's readings of Descartes in comparative perspective. Motrosilova draws the inference from her comparative analysis that Mamardasvili posed the question about the conditions of possibility "in the world" for Husserl's 'phenomenological reduction', which re veals the cogito as epoch? (or ostranenie), but also that the "acquisition of the reduction" by the philosopher leads him into "tragic alienation" from the world in which he lives and thinks.3 In an analysis of a wider scope, Vladimir Kalinicenko puts forward the thesis that Mamardasvili's reading of Descartes demonstrates that the seeds of non-classical rationality are al ready present in Descartes' own mode of thinking. To illustrate this, Kalinicenko undertakes a detailed analysis of Mam ardasvili's Kartezianskie razmyslenija [Cartesian Meditations] in which Mamardasvili returns to the concept of cogito as the principal approach to thought and knowledge. Kalinicenko finds that Mamardasvili defends Descartes' notion of God (in the face of Nietzsche's famous proclamation about the 'death of God') as a "point of intensity" which leads thought into the transcendental sphere, or somewhere beyond everyday experi ence. By means of the idea of God or cogito, the perceiving subject is led to a certain phenomenological plenitude or "ex cess" (polnota), constituted in the "phenomenological layer" of consciousness, and this is possible only thanks to the dualism of body and soul. Thus Cartesian dualism, "can never be over come" and constitutes the condition of possibility of our understanding of the "metaphysical matter" of thought.4 Kalinicenko takes literally Mamardasvili's interpretation, in KR, of Descartes' assertion about the unification of body and soul (in correspondence with Princess Elisabeth), which Mam ardasvili calls "one of the mysteries" {tain) of Descartes' phi losophy which cannot be explained in 'rational terms.' It is necessary to operate carefully with ex cathedra statements ad dressed to contemporaries and take into account the entire political and personal context of the utterance. It is also neces sary to question Mamardasvili's extrapolation of modern sub jectivity from what Mamardasvili himself identifies as Descartes' "dualism." For example, Mamardasvili's concept of "the abyss"</page><page sequence="3">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 207 [zazor - see R XIII, p. 86], which he also equates with the principle of undecidability (princip neopredelennosti-see R XIII, p. 86), resonates with the psychoanalytic concept of the "split subject" of the unconscious. However, whether Mamardasvili arrived at his concept of zazor as a result of Descartes' dualist conception of subject and object is questionable. A more likely source for Mamardasvili's conception of the phenomenological 'abyss' (zazor) are Husserl's antinomies (of noema and noesis, or of the 'natural' and 'phenomenological' attitudes). When Mamardasvili asserts that he wants to find a way of incorpo rating the sentient perceiving being into the scientific picture of the world, he is echoing Husserl's belief that "the world-directed sciences need the further supplement of phenomenological reflection if they are to be truly scientific."5 Thus Mamardasvili is continuing, not always without contradictions, Husserl's rather than Descartes' philosophical project, despite his declarative statements and assertive privileging of Descartes' persona in his own lectures and published works. Despite various critical attempts to map Mamardasvili's thinking about the processes of consciousness in perception, critical work on Mamardasvili as philosopher and theoretician of a non-classical paradigm of knowledge coinciding with European modernity6 is still in statu nascendi. What is needed is not a simple exegesis of Mamardasvili's ideas but their critical contextualization in contemporary Russian and European philosophy. It is not a question of showing the 'influences' on the Russian-Georgian philosopher, but of evaluating the scope of his innovation in appropriating the European classical and post-classical philosophical and critical traditions. This is not an easy task because of the predominantly 'oral' style of even the written texts penned (or edited) by Mamardasvili. His texts are, in the words of his collaborator Vladimir Zincenko, reve latory but not rendered "in the most transparent language."7 Mamardasvili's writing is replete with echoes of or intertextual allusions to other thinkers. An initial critical task is to decode these echoes in a close reading of his texts. Such an 'exact' approach can lead to more general insights about the direction from which Mamardasvili is coming as he moves into</page><page sequence="4">208 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER previously unchartered theoretical territory in Russian phe nomenology and more generally. In the following re-reading of Classical and Non-Classical Ideals, in particular chapters 1 and 2, I will attempt to outline, first, Mamardasvili's conception of 'classical' knowledge in terms of his references to Descartes' cogito, and, second, his construction of non-classical knowledge in terms of his under standing of the phenomenon. In the course of this investigation, I will situate Mamardasvili's theses on the phenomenon in a context that includes thinkers of the 20th century, notably Ludwig Wittgenstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Derri da, and Jacques Lacan. On this basis, I will tentatively situate Mamardasvili's concept of a non-classical rationality in the modernist, post-structuralist paradigm of European thought.8 MAMARDASVILI'S CLASSICAL PARADIGM OF KNOWLEDGE Mamardasvil's reference to Descartes' philosophy constitutes neither a systematic exegesis nor a critique, yet the reference is vital for him in the same sense that the reference to 'classical discourse' is important for Michel Foucault in the construction of his model of the discourse of modernity in, for instance, The Birth of the Clinic:An Archeology of Medical Perception (1973) [Naissance de la clinique J 963 J. Similarly, when Mamardasvili privileges Descrates as the model of 'classical' ontology, he is using the term "ontology" in the sense of "structure" (as in the structure of consciousness) and not in the sense of essential 'final causes.' Like Foucault and Lacan, Mamardasvili is essentially a post-Structuralist9 thinker. According to Mamardasvili's reading of Descartes, classical knowledge is delimited by the notion of cogito. Let me there fore introduce Mamardasvili's term "cogitai knowledge." Mamardasvili's elaborations on "cogitai knowledge" can be summed up in the following theses: 1 The cogito is irreducible and hence the basis of ontological certainty of the Self. The cogito is self-referential and is certain of nothing but its own existence as a thinking being.</page><page sequence="5">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 209 2 Consciousness and cogito are at one end of the process of perception while the observed material object is at the other. This is what Mamardasvili posits as the source of Cartesian dualism. 3 The object in classical knowledge is a spatial object, given to 'external' observation. 4 The object is situated in a continuous 'space'10 of observation (of both experience and experiment) and thus presupposes an all-powerful consciousness ("a hyper-empirical continuous consciousness") who observes the object in continuous, homogeneous time and space.11 5 On the positive side of the dualism of subject/object is the fact that the object is 'transparent' - fully 'visible' - for the perceiving subject just as consciousness is transparent to it self. Transparency thus marks classical knowledge or, speaking with the post-structuralists, who were, after all, Mamardasvili's Western contemporaries, in classical knowl edge the signifier (sign) is transparent to the signified (meaning). Transparency here is synonymous with the idea of "pure consciousness," already identified by Mamardasvili in his 1971 joint article on bourgeois philosophy (see R XIII, pp. 125-146) as the 'methodology' of classical reflexivity. The latter presup posed that the object of thought and the act of thought coin cided with or were equal to one another. On this point, Mamardasvili is in good company. Transparency of sign and meaning, or symptom and disease, also characterizes the par adigm of 'classical' knowledge according to Foucault. It is bound up with the "postulate that henceforth the signifier (sign and symptom) would be entirely transparent for the signified, which would appear, without concealment or residue, in its most pristine reality, and that the essence of the signified - the heart of the disease - would be entirely exhausted in the intel ligible syntax of the signifier."12 'Transparency' is the operative term for post-structuralists like Foucault when they try to explain 'classical knowledge' in terms of its 'modulation' into 'modern' knowledge, which is grounded in the 'clinical gaze.'13 Mamardasvili follows suit in his own analytic of knowledge.</page><page sequence="6">210 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER In Mamardasvili's lexicon, Descartes' formula of "clear and distinct" perception is taken up repeatedly. It is possible to surmise that it led Mamardasvili to the idea of 'transparency' of sign and meaning. However, the analogy: conscious ness = transparency = object of consciousness becomes pos sible for Mamardasvili because the 'object' has imperceptibly mutated into a 'transcendental object' in his discussion of 'classical ontology' which modulates into non-classical ontol ogy without ever crossing a well-defined conceptual border.14 Thus according to Mamardasvili, classical rationality posits not only a "centred" cogito, but a centred subject (the "/"15) to the extent that this subject appears to be a "continuous carrier" of perceived events. Mamardasvili will return to the topic of continuity of the states of consciousness by transposing conti nuity to another - virtual and pre-verbal - level of consciousness which is not only non-spatial but also non-representable. The virtual and pre-verbal or 'reduced' level of consciousness will be called the 'internal' or 'phenomenological' space of consciousness with its own time-space or chronotope. In a subsequent chapter of Classical and Non-Classical Ideals, Mamardasvili speaks of the "phenomenon of consciousness" in a "continuum" of "being-consciousness" that is complex and multi-dimensional and that is a function or effect of "structures" not controlled by the individual (R XIII, p. 91). This phenom enological space of consciousness (for which Mamardasvili never uses the Freudian term das Unbewusste although it seems to resonate with it) is not "an epi-phenomenon" of reality, or a mimetic representation of reality. This phenomenological space is unrepresentable, yet produces an effect of "totality" (celosnosti) or of "systematicity" precisely because of its "un representability" as a "whole" or as a "living totality," which is "invisible" (compare R XIII, pp. 92-93). Thus, classical knowledge is, according to Mamardasvili's extrapolations from Descartes, 'cogitai'. What cogitai knowl edge means for Descartes, we find on reading Descartes, is that sensory perception16 is unreliable and does not guarantee the correct knowledge of the object. There is an unbridgeable gap between the res extensa (objects of the material universe) and</page><page sequence="7">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 211 res cogitans (the thinking substances that are the human beings). What makes the object (or truth) known for Descartes - but not in equal measure for Mamardasvili - is the existence of a God who implants the 'correct' ideas (of reason) into the res cogitans and defeats the 'evil genius' of doubt and illusion. Mamardasvili thus wanders in and out of Descrates' analytic of the object, now staying close to, now moving away from Descartes' model. Mamardasvili appears to stay close to Des cartes,17 albeit not in lexicon, when he expounds the classical conception of the physical object as "that phenomenon whose spatiality coincides with its content" (R XIII, p. 12). The physical object coincides with itself in space; the terms "objective" and "spatial" being synonymous. For Descartes, Mamardasvili infers, materiality is coeval with spatiality or externality - an outward surface that is accessible to an ob server. Consciousness, on the other hand, is a non-spatial dis position. Classical knowledge is therefore, according to Mamardasvili, knowledge of spatial objects which yields the classical principle of experimental science, summed up by Mamardasvili as follows: perception through sensory organs is perception of material objects and their effects.18 However, 'externality' as used by Mamardasili here raises a problem. While Descartes speaks of spatiality as three dimensional space, Mamardasvili's 'translation' of three dimensionality into 'externality' is ambivalent. Externality could be a two-dimensional surface. That is precisely the sense in which the term 'externality' is used in post-structuralism to describe the modern paradigm of knowledge, which is groun ded in language as 'surface' and finitude. It is precisely the valorization of spatiality and materiality as properties of lan guage that marks a shift from 'classical' (in Foucault's sense) to post-structural (i.e. 20th century) thinking about the object in Western critical theory.19 This appropriation of spatiality by the philosophers of language and discourse goes back to Freud and Wittgenstein. Freud said in the Interpretation of Dreams that the dream-content "is expressed ... in pictographic [not phonetic] script."20 Similarly, Wittgenstein asserted that lan guage operates spatially [that is, pictographically] and stipulated</page><page sequence="8">212 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER that simple names [or signs], which derive their meaning from sentences or propositions, come together in the manner of a group - "like a tableau vivant" [living picture] - to represent states of affairs, which model the world in/with/through lan guage.21 Mamardasvili's model of 'classical knowledge' thus straddles two epistemological paradigms - one being Descartes' and the other echoing the phenomenology of Husserl or phenomenol ogists before and after the latter. Thus, for example, Mam ardasvili asserts that "external observation," which is capable of disclosing "the essence" of the object, is "reflexive" in its orientation. "External observation" is part of the regime of cogito, or the 'transcendental I,' with which it is commensu rate.22 This non-Cartesian attitude anticipates what Mam ardasvili will say next about the relation of one consciousness to another consciousness. This is how Mamardasvili continues: "Cogito isolates, amongst the totality of phenomena, one phenomenon which is a category unto itself, characterized by unmediated certainty ("neposredsvtennoj dostovernosti") (R XIII, p. 13)." It is a phenomenon, which can be understood in its own essence, without supplementary assumptions. This phenomenon, which is grounded in its own certainty and which is irreducible to other phenomena, Mamardasvili calls the phenomenon of consciousness. It has no referent outside itself: it is self-referential. Mamardasvili continues to extrapolate, using Wittgensteinian terminology: consciousness is consciousness of 'states of affairs' and hence it is consciousness of consciousness. As such, it is transcendental. The fact that consciousness is not a point in space but rather is constituted as a diffuse sphere means that nothing other than another consciousness is commensurate with it.23 This means, according to Mamardasvili, that we cannot situate within consciousness an object, which does not share the characteristics of consciousness or is, as we might say, self consciousness. Such an inference, however, puts an inflection on the definition of the 'classical' object, which is no longer strictly Cartesian. The 'object' of consciousness which has here become another consciousness is more a lead into Hegel's</page><page sequence="9">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 213 phenomenology of spirit than an inference from Descartes' cogito. With the addition of desire to the definition of self consciousness, Hegel's axiom about the relationship of subject (self-consciousness) and its object is as follows: "Self-consciousness achieves its satisfaction only in another self-consciousness."24 Mamardasvili is true to Descrates' principle of the self-cer tainty of cogito when he infers that self-referentiality and self reflexivity delimit classical rationality. However, Mamardasvili uses terms such as "phenomenon of consciousness," "knowl edge of states of affairs." and "conscious contents" which are not part of the Cartesian lexicon. These terms belong, rather, to Freudian psychoanalysis (conscious contents), phenomenology (phenomenon of consciousness) and Wittgenstein's philosophy of language (states of affairs). Such post-classical terms antici pate a new model of consciousness in which Descartes' phi losophy plays the role of 'instigator' or 'pre-text' rather than a 'primary text' subject to a close-reading or critical exegesis. Thus when Mamardasvili says, that "each conscious content is framed by the Vs awareness that it is conscious of the con scious content," and when he gives the example of the sensation of pain,25 Mamardasvili is no longer working exclusively within the 'classical' or Cartesian paradigm.26 What he is anticipating is the primacy of perception27 as a subjective process, in which the self-conscious subject constructs the world, not as illusion, but as a 'picture,' 'image' or 'model' (Wittgenstein's Bild).2S This is what emerges in Mamardasvili's treatment of the con cept of phenomenon in the second chapter of Classical and Non-Classical Ideals. In Mamardasvili's reading of Descartes, it is not the "I" which is centred but the cogito. Hence it is not the "I" which is certain of itself or the world, it is cogito which is an absolute certainty29 in its self-giveness or self-awareness: "We know that we know," as Ivan Karamazov says, in despair and self mockery.30 This implies that 'classical' knowledge is potentially grounded in tautology. However, Descartes does not tease out this inference,31 while Mamardasvili, in reading Descartes, does not point to its potentiality, although he will later in the text</page><page sequence="10">214 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER speak about tautology in non-classical ontology. Instead, Mamardasvili returns to the duality embedded in classical rationality by reflecting on the fact that classical self-con sciousness is not 'empirical' or 'psychological,' that it does not point to an awareness of the self as some kind of real, empirical, psychological subject. However, already the concept of classical self-awareness receives a non-classical inflection in Mam ardasvili's interpretation, when he asserts that it is awareness of an indissoluble connection between the content of an event (that has taken place) and the fact of knowing that this event took place.33 While Mamardasvili frequently refers to the "event of thought," the "act of thought" and eventually, like Gilles Deleuze or Mikhail Bakhtin and Charles Sanders Peirce before him, arrives at a philosophy of thought as action, Descartes' writing contains reference only to "intellectual act"34 or to "acts of thought, such as understanding, willing, imagining, having sense perception."35 There is no theorizing of the 'event' in Descartes' philosophy. That is Mamardasvili's 'supplement' to classical rationality from the perspective of non-classical rationality. It is also significant that Mamardasvili situates the knowable event in the past - as something that has been. This means not only that according to Mamardasvili, classical per ception is a cogitai (transcendental), not a psychological (mental) act, but that cogito (classical or not) is subject to the laws of inscription and deferral (which Mamardasvili does not state), known to us through the Freudian model of Nachtrag or what Derrida has called the mechanism of deferral in language and meaning. Mamardasvili returns to the 'classical' paradigm with his point on transformations. Because perception and knowledge of physical phenomena are ascribed to a continuous conscious act of cogito, classical ontology does not account for trans formations. Here Mamardasvili is again with Foucault, who would say that classical science does not know discontinuities37 within the classical 'normalized' field of perception. Transfor mations, Mamardasvili continues, are assumed to have already taken place, to have been instantaneous. They are thus</page><page sequence="11">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 21 5 presupposed to be dimensionless and ideal. Meanwhile, 'real' or actual consciousness is discrete, says Mamardasvili, the modern structuralist;38 it actualizes itself in subjects separated in time and space, who are undergoing constant inner or subjective transformations and who are situated in the midst of a physical world which is in constant flux. No one thinks or cognizes continuously, says the post-classical Mamardasvili. Thus a minimal critique of 'classical' ontology is the starting point for Mamardasvili's own non-classical, post-structuralist model of knowledge. THE EVENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE WORLD AS 'WORK IN PROGRESS' According to Mamardasvili, the problem with perception identified by non-classical rationality is the difficulty of intro ducing phenomena of consciousness into a "scientific picture of the world" understood in the classical sense. This difficulty arises because conscious phenomena, which as it were "accu mulate" upon each other, create their own space and time and thus escape observation in terms of the classical formula, according to which [the subject of] observation can be separated from the object in an external space of observation. Classical pedagogy, for example, assumed a universal ob server who, occupying position A in a universal space of observation and knowing what was happening in A, could impart this knowledge to a child, or the child would arrive at the same point A (through some hidden dynamic evolution of his own) and come to the same understanding that the universal observer already has. However, Mamardasvili goes on to say that this classical ontology is belied by the fact that a person can understand (one assumes this is meant in the sense of 'to know' or what Ivan Karamazov calls "znat"') only that which he has already understood, falling back on what he can "remember" (see R XIII, p. 19). In other words, tautology appears to be the underlying structure of non-classical knowl edge, although at this point Mamardasvili does not call it by its name. Thus the act of understanding (one assumes this is the</page><page sequence="12">216 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER act of 'knowing' or 'cognizing,' as in 'being aware of) is not grounded in any causality of understanding, but is an instan taneous "spark," says Mamardasvili, the 'modern' rationalist, who at this point comes close to Lacan's definition of the psychoanalytic subject, who comes into 'meaning' (into 'con sciousness' or 'sense') through metaphor which is a "spark" that flares up like lightening in the 'gap' between the 'symbolic' and the 'real' (the representable and the unrepresentable, or the visible and the invisible).39 Mamardasvili introduces discrete but representative exam ples of the process of subjective perception which countermand the classical postulates of a universal space of observation, a universal observer ("a hyper-empirical continuous conscious ness (R XIII, p. 20)" and an object situated in external space but not possessing its own time and space. Mamardasvili's examples illustrate the importance of the concept of transfor mation or, as we would say with Foucault, discontinuity, for non-classical ontology. One such example is drawn by Mamardasvili from the lin guistic development of a child. The child does not acquire language in linear progression, by going through the units of language one by one. The brain does not have the capacity to store the huge number of linguistic units that would need to be acquired in this way. At about the age of three, the child makes a sudden "jump" when it becomes evident that he knows the language. With his next example of a sudden transformation, which illustrates the function of transformation or discontinuity delineating the non-classical structure of consciousness, Mam ardasvili introduces the notion of sexual difference through which he problematizes the concept of a physical fact. Mam ardasvili identifies the notion of sexual difference as the starting point for the science of psychoanalysis, which according to him revolutionized thinking in the 20th century and led to the for mation of a non-classical ontology. Mamardasvili defines a "physical fact" in the first place not as a material fact (vescestvennyj fakt), but "a fact which has taken place irrevo cably and about which we can speak objectively" (R XIII,</page><page sequence="13">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 217 p. 21)." Mamardasvili sees correctly that psychoanalysis has demonstrated that sexual difference does not exist as a physical fact in the world before a subject comes into existence. Sexual difference is a thought category that the child discovers only after complex psychic processing, that is, imagining, interpret ing through "childish theories" that "explain why a boy has a tumescence where a girl has a cavity." Derrida40 and other post-structuralist readers of Freud have treated the same example of difference as 'pure difference' and raised it into an ontological category in the absence of which cultural knowl edge would be impossible. Thus, according to Mamardasvili, the notion of sexual dif ference as a fact arises as a "local effect" of the "non-local," the "global," the "infinite," and independent of linear progression through a set. Instead of linear connectedness between the 'event' of consciousness as a 'fact' generated by consciousness and its 'origin' in a normalized field of observation (the causal connectedness of subject and object), non-classical rationality posits a world in progress in the sense of 'work in progress' as the 'real' field of investigation into consciousness. In this world as 'work in progress,' there can be no moral norms that could identify 'sexual deviations,' 'abnormal states' and the like.41 In order for the non-classical thinker to represent the "reality" of this world of (psychic) "work in progress," he must deal not with the phenomena derived from the 'efficient causes of nature' (speaking with Kant) or the classical object whose spatiality is its content (speaking with Mamardasvili who is extrapolating from Descartes), but with effects of phenomena which are "the effects of the psyche, speech, and language."42 These phenomena, which fall under the regime of unrepeat ability (neobratimosV - irreversibility - in the Cartesian Medi tations)^ or the uniqueness44 of the event, must be brought into the field of the investigator-observer, who can no longer be the "absolute observer" of classical ontology. To understand this "world in progress," grounded on the uniqueness of the event, Mamardasvili wants to set aside one of the fundamental antinomies of what he calls classical ontology: the antinomy between the world of essences and the world of</page><page sequence="14">218 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER appearances (see R XIII, p. 22). These antinomies are not strictly speaking attributable to Descartes' 'classical rationality' but go further back, to Aristotle. Descartes is not concerned with "appearances," which he has overcome, but with showing beyond doubt that the material world is the point de caption (anchoring point) of rational ideas. Mamardasvili takes as his example of an "essence" the existence of the feeling of love. This feeling cannot be understood in its essence unless it is experienced, he says, and with this privileging of experience enters the domain of modern phenomenology. The essence of the phenomenon of love, he says, does not elude us simply because of our immaturity, but eludes us as "appearance," as an "object" because love is one of those 'things' (Mamardasvili does not say "object" -predmet - but vescf - 'substance') which must be "lived through" and re-instated, re-constituted repeatedly and progressively, against "a background of infinite potentialities (R XIII, p. 23)." Love is thus an empirical fact of experience (empiriceskij fakt ispytanija). The 'empirical' fact of the empirical experience of love is not a simple bringing into form of the repetition of essence. The empirical experienced fact is meaningful in relation to the "essence" of love because we cannot imagine, says Mamardasvili, a world of pre-given laws and essences, in relation to which our consciousness would be a simple reflection, a world of absolute knowledge "awaiting our cognition as it drew closer to us (ibid.)." In itself, this critique of pre-given laws and essences, which we could perhaps imag ine, is a critique grounded in the postulates of phenomenology. Event (or fact) and experience of the event (or fact) thus acquire synonymy in Mamardasvili's nomenclature. The con sequence of the uniqueness of the event as a fact of empirical experience is that in the 'maintenance'45 of the "living state" ('zivoe sostojanie'),46 nothing is ideally posited or pre-given. Every event is 'empirical' in that it is experienced and has to be experienced to be "known." The "individuation" of the phe nomenon, the understanding of it as unique, as having taken place 'once-and-for-all' (raz i navsegda, as in Dostoevsky's formula of the act in The Brothers Karamazov), as an irre versible and an unrepeatable event of consciousness, is coeval</page><page sequence="15">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 219 with the ontology or structure of individual consciousness in Mamardasvili's non-classical rationality. Non-classical knowledge as "phenomenal" Subjectifying the "physical event" or transforming a "physical fact" into an "event" or "fact" of consciousness constitutes a new kind of knowledge, imparts new sense to what can be known. In the non-classical ontology, knowledge becomes, like the experience of the essence of love, an event: it "has to hap pen," it is a happening that appears, like a phenomenon. The question arises, where is this "happening" or "phenomenal knowledge" (javljajusceesja znanie) situated? Where is it to be thought? In what place? (R XIII, p. 27) The answer is: in no place!47 Instead, it is to be thought in the "phenomenological shift" ("v sdvige" - R XIII, p. 32), which takes place in con sciousness with the assistance of what Mamardasvili, with Husserl, calls a "phenomenological reduction." The "reduc tion" is an "abstraction" of the "features of existence of certain thought contents, a mode of existence distinct from the content ofthat existence (R XIII, p. 32)." It was the "reduction" which allowed Husserl to pose the problem of the phenomenon as "an approach to formations of consciousness as existents [podhoda k obrazovanijam soznaija kak suscestvovanijam]" (R XIII, p. 32). This is what makes the non-classical understanding of the phenomenon distinct from classical knowledge: knowledge has moved away from "content" (of the phenomenon) to (the phenomenon as) "being" or "ontology" - hence, we infer, as structure of being (R XIII, p. 36). Thus for Mamardasvili, the phenomenological reduction is a mode of existence or being while for Husserl it was a philosoph ical attitude which allowed a form of reasoning that focused on the essence or structure of things. This form of reasoning has been called 'deconstruction' in post-structural theory. While the "reduction," conceived as a mode of being, is an "abstract procedure," the phenomenon possesses a certain materiality or 'textuality.' Thus the phenomenon is a configu ration of consciousness that "possesses a sensory texture which emerges in the objectifying split between the mentally intelligible</page><page sequence="16">220 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER articulation and being"(R XIII, p. 39) as a localized expression of an invisible totality. For example, a "sound as a phenomenon of music is not a sound-phenomenon;" instead, it is "the material part of the elemental musical system, it is its 'rational matter.' The same applies to the sound-phoneme as an element of the system of speech (ibid.)." According to Mamardasvili, what we perceive is always "reduced" in and through the phenomenon. This is a step be yond Husserl's phenomenology, which posits a "natural atti tude" in the perception of "my surrounding world" that can precede as well as co-exist with the "phenomenological attitude" which 'follows' the reduction.48 At the same time, the phe nomenon is, according to Mamardasvili, an index of the 'materiality' of consciousness. Mamardasvili cites the symptom (of Freudian psychoanalysis, although he does not refer to Freud) as an example of a phenomenologically reduced phe nomenon, which illustrates the "physical" or "corporeal" aspect of consciousness. The symptom is a displaced49 identity (kosvennoe celostnoe), irreducible and not identical with itself, that points to something else or that gives expression to some thing that is "other." The example of the symptom Mam ardasvili gives is Freud's lapsus linguae of begleidigen = an amalgam of begleiten [to accompany] and beleidigen [to offend]. The symptom is for Mamardasvili an "impossible object," a linguistic monster. Yet we must assume that such "impossible objects" are generated somehow, according to some kind of laws, whose logic is hidden and grounded in invisible sense relations (relations which construct meaning). These must be assumed to constitute "... stable or durable object(al) forma tions, independently self-generating within the system of con sciousness."50 Thus the inference is that all objects of consciousness are "impossible objects," or quasi-objects, which manifest themselves in the same way as the symptom. Like the symptom, then, the objects perceived phenomenally represent "the bodily or physical side of the 'reality of consciousness'" (R XIII, p. 43). The phenomenological objects of consciousness, by contrast with the classical external objects of observation, have</page><page sequence="17">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 221 "internality." (R XIII, p. 42) They have "capacity" to store information ("they code singular and local information"), and are "objects-Centaurs," extending across heterogeneous re gions (of consciousness), thus escaping the totalizing effects of an overarching conception of the total interconnectedness of the Universe (R XIII, p. 42). These "objects" have, unlike the classical object deployed in a homogeneous universal space, their own time and space, distinct from the space of every 'other' object as well as the space of the external Singular Observer. This "phenomenological" time and space is, according to Mamardasvili, "the space of transformations or states of being ["zivikh sostojanii"], it is space as dissemination and externalisation [rasprostranennosV i soobscennost*] of states [of being]." (R XIII, p. 42) Thus, consciousness in Mamardasvili's ontology is a con stantly self-transforming topology of indissoluble or irreducible relations [vzaimodeistvii] arising within their own time-space or "chronotope." (R XIII, p. 43) It is within this topology that Mamardasvili situates the "real" and "objective" (objectai) "acts of consciousness" in which "meaning and symbolic for mations"51 are grounded (R XIII, p. 43). It is this time-space of the topological "base layer" that constitutes the "living event of knowing" as something 'objective' and really taking place in the subject, and not as a reflexive or mental (or 'cogitai') category. Consciousness is, in fact, a "stream of consciousness," as Mamardasvili inferred from his encounter with Marcel Proust's prose, and as he might have extrapolated from Husserl's notion of the "flow of consciousness."52 Going beyond Husserl's phenomenon and reduction, Mamardasvili defines the phenomenological objects, which have their own chronotopes, as "quasi-material projections of the subject into the world," (R XIII, p. 43) - quasi-organs of consciousness, acting as receptacles of that "interiority" which is not accessible from either the 'outside' or through intro spection. These "objects-Centaurs" cannot be subsumed under the antinomies of "inner" and "outer," they cannot be classed as "physical" in the 'classical' sense, and they are not randomly conscious or "experienced" events in the sense of traditional</page><page sequence="18">222 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER psychology. They, we infer, connect the 'visible' with the 'invisible' and constitute what Merleau-Ponty called 'the gaze.'53 Thus Mamardasvili's phenomena are complex tran scendental structures not corresponding to objects observed in the real world in a mimetic fashion but constituting themselves as the "reality of consciousness" which is itself an event in the world. The phenomenon as (Model' The phenomenological reduction, as explicated by Mamardasvili, provides his theory of perception with another key concept: that of the model. The phenomenological shift or reduction is, according to Mamardasvili, an abstraction of "the mode of being" of the contents of thought ("myslitePnyh soderzanii", [R XIII, p. 32]), which mode cannot be arrived at "deductively." The "mode of being" of thought contents is a function of the subject's "I can" ("mogu [ne mogu] sub'ekta) (R XIII, p. 32). Thought contents can only "be" - they are subject to no other determi nation than pure being.54 By way of his continued (positive) critique of classical ontology, Mamardasvili concludes that the consequence of seeing things 'clearly and precisely' in classical ontology, thanks to the removal of the shadow of the "soul" from the space of observation, "was the splitting of the anthropomorphic unity between the observed object and the subject of observation (R XIII, p. 26)." When the 'soul' has been reinstated in the process of observation, or when, as Mamardasvili puts it, one takes into account "the data made up of the feelings" of the observing consciousness through its own self-awareness, then the point of intersection between the events of the Universe and the events of representation becomes the logical space of models.55 The 'phenomenon' (javlenie) in this "logical space of models" is that which "appears," but what appears is the "articulation of the effects of the world, accessible to observa tion (R XIII, p. 26)." This leads Mamardasvili to the axiom, already known in phenomenology (of Merleau-Ponty and others), that where there is no structure of consciousness to intersect with the observed Universe, there is no knowledge of</page><page sequence="19">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 223 the Universe. We cannot say how the universe is apart from and independently of our sensibility, and if the Universe exists as such, then we cannot know everything about it, says Mam ardasvili. The structure of consciousness which gives rise to the phe nomenon of "the phenomenon" is, according to Mam ardasvili's formulation, "elementary,"56 that is, "below it, we cannot pass (R XIII, p. 27)." Or as Andr? Gide put it, in the title of his 'fantastic' novel about the split subject and its relation with the 'other, it is like a "porte ?troite."51 This phe nomenological consciousness (as we may now call it) is both unique and without concrete (objective) identity since there is no "algorithmic transition along a continuum" from its objectified structure into meaning (sense) or intelligible thought. Because of the object-less structure of consciousness, the latter cannot potentially embrace all the concrete states filling its horizon in order to define itself as here, in a singular point (or as a presence).5* What is actualized in consciousness is a connectedness of the whole which is supplementary to the concrete contents. And this supplementary connectedness cannot be expressed through language used to describe objects of experience and the observation of these. Thus consciousness, with its "absolute" (irreducible) particles, its absolutely "indi vidual" features, is invisible or, as we would say with the post structuralists,59 an absence. This invisible consciousness, which is an absence, can be articulated only through the subject, but a subject who cannot express consciousness by means of the objectified language in which he couches the intelligible objects of knowledge. Thus, we conclude, phenomenological con sciousness is an absence which cannot be described in terms of its concrete contents or 'presences,' using discursive language. Phenomenological consciousness is unrepresentable. This dis tinguishes the non-classical paradigm of knowledge from the classical, in which cogito was able to know objects, in "clear and distinct" manner.60 In the context of this discussion of the phenomenological consciousness, a "phenomenon," says Mamardasvili, is a technical term and not to be understood in its simple dictionary</page><page sequence="20">224 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER meaning. We do not "experience" or "feel" everything that comes at us from the outside world. Not everything "appears" (is a phenomenon) to us. What does "appear" (what is a phe nomenon) is that for which a model exists, that which has been modeled and which presupposes the existence of a subject as an identity. Thus the models ("pictures" - Wittgeinstein's "Bilder"61) of the phenomena of the world or the world as phenomenological appearances or phenomenological "facts" is a given "fact of the world." Thanks to these "facts," which are the products of modeling, we can "see" objects and contents, including psychic contents or concepts (R XIII, p. 28). Here is how Mamardasvili describes the connectedness of the model with the 'real' object in the world: In other words, the models of facts (of the world) do exist, they cannot be just Man's constructs, but a fact made possible and produced by relations [existing in] the Universe, a part of whose evolution is the evolution of the trajectory of the subject. Or put another way - the actions of the world as phenomenal [kak javlennye] do exist, they exist as reality, not as representa tion (although it is difficult to separate, in analysis, psychic formations from consciousness itself, from the phenomenon of consciousness). (R XIII, p. 28) While conceding that 'objects' are, as Wittgenstein said, "relational" (models are derived from "relations existing in the Universe"), Mamardasvili nevertheless insists, contra Witt genstein, that "models" are not "mere constructs." Although this appears to be a remnant of Cartesian dualism carried over by Mamardasvili into his 'non-classical' paradigm of knowl edge, it is, on closer inspection, an echo of Marx's (non-phe nomenological) insistence on the existence of the 'material world' which colours Mamardasvili's ontology. In the first in stance, Marx's progressive view of history will determine Mamardasvili's understanding of the 'historical' development of consciousness as part of "the evolution of the trajectory of the subject," while the structure of individual consciousness will become an effect of history: It is here that our problem of rationality evolves further, placing us before the fact that the very state in which we express our knowledge about phe nomena or in which we sustain them [phenomena], is not only a complex</page><page sequence="21">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 225 and total product of our life and our history, but, in turn, a part of the Universe and its evolution. (R XIII, p. 29) While being explicable historically, our knowledge of the phe nomenon is at the same time grounded in "being," which in Mamardasvili's understanding means the topology of that which has taken place as an event of consciousness. In the sphere of being (suscestvovanie - R XIII, p. 36), the phenom enon becomes something that is independent of sensory per ception (of 'spatial objects') and is closer, in Mamardasvili's description, to what C.G. Jung called "archetypes."62 Thus Mamardasvili explains, using the example of the 'moving Sun,' that our knowledge of reality (the knowledge that the Sun does not move but that the Earth moves) does not affect "the work of our consciousness," and of "our perceptual apparatus:"63 Our consciousness unfailingly generates linkages, condensations, totalities, impenetrable to the ray of science, continuing to shed certain determinations in relation to the whole of our [psychic] activity and our conceptual con tents. In the millions of our psychosomatic reactions and orientations, in images-manipulators, in constructed and intensified emotional states and so on, we have a stable core concept of a static Earth (primordially perceived as elemental), which is irreducible, and of the moving Sun with all the dynamics of its light and radiation. In this connection, the former [jadro predstavlenija - the core of conceptualisation - SVG] can be called a phenomenon. Euclid's solid object can thus also be called a phenomenon. (R XIII, p. 37) It is because in the 'sphere of being' our perceptions are determined by beliefs and myths that it becomes necessary to 'perform' a phenomenological reduction, says Mamardasvili. Here we encounter a major terminological problem in Mamardasvili's phenomenology, which potentially leads to a contradiction. For Mamardasvili goes on to say that through the exclusion of the sphere of being, the phenomena of the world are reduced to the 'pure' phenomena which Mamardasvili calls "conscious objects" or "objects of con sciousness" [soznateVnye ob"ekty] (R XIII, p. 42). This would imply that Mamardasvili accepts the assumption of a "natural attitude" (Husserl) which precedes the phenomenological 'attitude' or reduction, despite his apparent overcoming of this</page><page sequence="22">226 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER Husserlian antinomy in proclaiming that all objects of con sciounses are subject to modeling and all are 'reduced' or 'impossible' objects. However, what Mamardasvili goes on to say next is that the 'pure' (or 'reduced') 'objects of conscious ness' fold in upon themselves [zakrucivajustsja vbok i na sebja], possess an 'internality' (R XIII, p. 43) and, like those objects Centaurs, sprout rhizomatically64 (as we could say with Deleuze and Guattari) in all sorts of different spheres or layers of con sciousness, as a result of which they cannot be totalized within a unified concept of the Universe. To eliminate the contradiction between what now appear to be two types of objects of con sciousness in Mamardasvili's revision and apparent rejection of Husserl's antinomies (the 'reduced' and the non-reduced), we may introduce the Freudian concept of the 'memory trace' {Erinnerungsspur), appropriated and extensively theorised by Derrida and other post-structuralists.65 We can then say that the 'reduced' or impossible object is equivalent to the uncon scious trace which is 'pure' in the sense that it is removed from the sphere of the subject's self-awareness but not from the sphere of consciousness. When the 'objects of consciousness' (phenomenologically reduced phenomena) are understood as equivalents of the memory trace (in the Freudian unconscious), then we can comprehend Mamardasvili's next assertion, namely that these 'objects' possess their own time and space, which Mamardasvili defines as the "space of transformations" or space of "living states," or space as "extension and expressivity of states." (R XIII, p. 42) Our equating of these 'objects' with the memory trace is confirmed further by the next assertion, namely, that the objects of consciousness have their own "phenomenological time and space" and escape the ray of understanding and finite knowledge. Or, as we could say once again with psychoanalysis in general and with Julia Kristeva in particular, these 'objects' are pre-symbolic (Kristeva would situate them in the semiotic "chora"66), and are relatives of the unrepresentable 'real' in Lacan's sense of the term le reel.61 They are constituted as affectivity that is related to Freud's hysteria as the primal topography of speech and language.68</page><page sequence="23">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 227 Thus Mamardasvili stays true to psychoanalytic theory of consciousness when he asserts that the transformations which the 'objects of consciousness' undergo are topological - that is, they alter their time-space structure or their "chronotope" (R XIII, p. 43). It is the chronotopical structure of the 'objects of consciousness' that imparts a materiality to them: the terms "its own time" and "its own space" describe not "spirits" or "a pure mind" but indicate quasi-material outgrowths of the subject in the world, the receptacle69 of that 'internality', which is inaccessible from either the outside or through introspection (although these are evidently living forces, an inner animating principle of self-generating activity), the theoretical objects of representation of which [of this internality - togo vnutrennego] cannot be situated 'there' (in physics) nor 'here' (in the psyche). (R XIII, p. 43) To sum up Mamardasvili's conception of the phenomenon we must cross over to Wittgenstein. We could say that Mam ardasvili's concept of the phenomenologically reduced phe nomenon corresponds in all its principal hallmarks to Wittgenstein's "simple object." In Wittgenstein's logicised philosophy of language, "objects" are potentialities ("Objects contain the possibility of all situations." Tractatus, 2.0141) and 'topologies' ("Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states of affairs. This space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thing without the space." Tractatus, 2.013). The phenomenon is for Mamardasvili, as well as for Wittgenstein, "a fact" of the world. That is, it possesses its own kind of materiality, is connected, by way of an abstract, pre-verbal logical schema, to states of affairs which are experientially 'reduced.' In "Prevrascennaja forma" (1970), Mamardasvili more explicitly defined a phenomenon as a gap in a system of 'real relations' in the world which has undergone a process of 'substitution' (zamescenie) or 'transformation.' The 'real' rela tion in a system of relations constituting a scientific truth (such as the one about the Earth revolving around the Sun) is 'substituted' by a 'false' or virtual (mnimoe) relation, constituted by the phenomenological 'fact' of the Sun moving around the</page><page sequence="24">228 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER Earth. From this we can see that Mamardasvili's phenomenon, which constitutes the 'content' of a 'transformed form' is moving into the neighborhood of the structure of metaphor. Mamardasvili's 'prevrascennaja forma' can thus be defined as the form of substitution - of the 'real' object by a virtual 'impossible' object. On the current reading of Mamardasvili's concept of the phenomenon, it appears that Mamardasvili is sailing close to Husserl, Merleau-Ponty and Wittgenstein. His appropriation of phenomenological models of consciousness allows him to construct his own specific multi-disciplinary model of non classical rationality. The specificity of this model is that its phenomenological aspects are compatible with Marxian theory. This is how Mamardasvili sums up the 'historical' and 'evolu tionary' perspective on consciousness, which he derives from it: It is here that our problem of rationality evolves further, placing us before the fact that the very state in which we express our knowledge about phe nomena or in which we sustain them [phenomena], is not only a complex and total product of our life and our history, but, in turn, a part of the Universe and its evolution. (R XIII, p. 29) I have attempted to explicate the initial outlines of Mam ardasvili's model of the object in perception, adumbrated by a context of post-structural readings and re-readings of phe nomenology, psychoanalytic theory and philosophy of lan guage. I have found that Mamardasvili casts off from the shores of 'classical' ontology without ever stepping off his ship of phenomenology or modernity. His thoughts about the structure of consciousness, the phenomenon, the phenomeno logical reduction, the phenomenological 'shift,' discontinuity of states of consciousness, the concept of difference and so on resonate with Continental philosophy and European critical theory of the first and second half of the 20th century. To his credit, Mamardasvili assimilated European phenomenology when it was still unthinkable in the Soviet Union of his uni versity days. He instituted, single handed, a post-Sructuralist trend on the Soviet academic scene of the 1970s and 1980s, when the only other manifestations of phenomenological</page><page sequence="25">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 229 thinking were the semiotics of culture (the Tartu School) and Bakhtin's theory of discourse. If Mamardasvili's phenomenol ogy reverberates with theoretical echoes of his Western con temporaries, then it is because he was Russia's Derrida, and Foucault, and Deleuze, and many others, all rolled into one, representing the free thought of post-Structuralism in an intellectual climate from which repression had not yet been suspended. If there is to be a "Russian post-Structuralism" as a topic of research, then such a topic must begin with an inves tigation into the critical thought of Merab Mamardasvili.

It is question able whether 'alienation' can be seen as 'tragic' in any other than the Marxian view of subjectivity. In psychoanalytic theory (as well as in Exis tentialism), alienation is a basic existential condition of the split subject of consciousness without which there would be no consciousness. 4 Vladimir Kalinicenko, op. cit., R XIII, p. 229 (free translation by me). 5 See Robert Sokolowski, entry on "Husserl," in Robert Audi (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second edition, Cambridge UP, Cambridge, 1999, p. 405. 6 Mamardasvili's time frame for the 'classical model' of rationality extends to the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th century, where he locates the evolution of "modern science" and "bourgeois philosophy." Mam ardasvili's model of'classical' thought exceeds Foucault's model of'classical science' by just over a century. Foucault placed the evolution of European modern discourses (medicine, discipline and finitude) somewhere in the 18th century while his analysis of representation in Velasquez's Las Meninas goes back even further, to the mid-17th century. 7 Vladimir Zincenko, 'M. Mamardasvili otkryvaet Dekarta psihologam,' in: Vstreca s Dekartom, op. cit., p. 271. 8 A Russian translation of Wittgenstein's Tractatus appeared at the end of the 1950-s. Mamardasvili makes reference to this in R XIX, pp. 215-216. In his essay, Vena na zare XX veka, Mamardasvili considered the Tractatus to</page><page sequence="26">230 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER be one of the best philosophical texts of that century (see KJaPF2, p. 398). Works by Merleau-Ponty and Lacan were also well-known to him. I am grateful to Tapani Laine for drawing my attention to the preceding historical and biographical facts. 9 On the term "Structuralism," compare also footnote 41 below. 10 'Space' is the term used by Mamardasvili, which introduces a Kantian 'echo' into his assimilation of Descartes. 11 The lexicon employed here by Mamardasvili is highly suggestive of a Kantian overcoding of the Russian philospher's assimilation of Descartes. I am grateful to Edward Swiderski for alerting me to this point. 12 See Michel Foucault, The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception, trans. A.M. Sheridan Smith, Travistock Publications, London, 1973 [first published in Paris, 1963]), p. 91. 13 Mauruce Merleau-Ponty also privileges the gaze as the agency of per ception in his phenomenology on which post-structuralist psychoanalytic theory (of Jacques Lacan) has built its model of the modern subjectivity. 14 I am grateful to Edward Swiderski for pointing out - in support of my reading of Mamardasvili's idiosyncratic assimilation of Descartes' idea of the object, that in Descartes' celebrated example of the 'melting candle,' Descartes "is not even certain 'what' the object is he seems to be attending to. Therefore recourse to consciousness is the only transparency available to him, given that he, Descartes, is hung up on certitude, not truth conditions for statements.] 15 I am grateful again to Edward Swiderski for pointing out that in Descartes' cogito, there is an T that has 'cogitationes'and the latter, like the former, are 'centered.' The centeredness distinguishes the 'classical' subject from the non-classical who, according to post-structural psychoanalytic theory, is typically a 'split' and 'de-centred' subject who does 'not know.' 16 Compare Descartes' summary findings on sensory perception in the "Sixth Meditation," which anticipate Hegel's analytic of the "this" and the "now" in The Phenomenology of Spirit (compare Section A, I: "Sense Certainty or the 'This' and 'Meaning' [Meinen]," G.W.F.

The Philosophical Writings of Rene Descartes, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 53. 17 Descartes speaks of "matter" and "extended things" rather than physical objects, which is Mamardasvili's 'modern' editing of Descartes' lexicon. Compare Descartes' formulation, in the "Fifth Medidation," of the essence of matter as three-dimensional extension and continuous quantity: "Quantity, for example, or 'continuous' quantity as the philosophers com monly call it, is something I distinctly imagine. That is, I distinctly imagine the extension of the quantity (or rather of the thing which is quantified) in length, breadth and depth."

Volume II, Cambridge UP, Cambridge, London, New York, New Rochelle, Melbourne, Sydnye, 1984, p. 44. 18 In Mamardasvili's non-classical paradigm of knowledge, objects will be chronotopic - crossed by time and in a space which is not physical. See this article under the subheading "Non-classical knowledge as phenomenal'" on page 11 below. 19 Compare, for example, Michel Foucault, Foucault on Blanchot: Maurice Blanchot, The Thought from Outside.

Curiously, in Symbol and consciousness Mamardasvili criticises the trend of 'non-interpretive description' which, in his words, ontologises language (culture, method, etc.) in modern philosophy (what he calls "positive" and "analytic" philosophy, but into which he includes Husserl and Wittgenstein). 22 Descartes posits not the material object as a target of perception but "the idea" of a material object which can be known through the "intellectual faculty", given to us by God, which tends towards truth." See The Philo sophical Writings of Descartes, translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, Dugald Murdoch, Volume II, Cambridge UP, Cambridge, London, New York, New Rochelle, Melbourne, Sydney, 1984, p. 104. 23 R XIII, pp. 13-14 (a free translation or paraphrase by me). 24 G.W.F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, translated by A. V. Miller, with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay, Oxford UP, Oxford, New York, Toronto, Melbourne 1977, paragraph 175, p. 110. 25 "For example, the conscious content of pain is the awareness of pain. Awareness of pain, which is of the same order as the knowledge of an event taking place, is not dependent on whether we can prove that in reality the cause of the pain does not exist, that the pain only 'appears' to us. Whether it appears to us or not (whether it is 'real') is irrelevant because the content of a cognized phenomenon as a phenomenon of consciousness and cognition are given absolutely by consciousness." R XIII, p. 14. 26 Descartes uses the sensation of pain as an example to illustrate not that "appearances" are "real" but the opposite point: that pain is an index (we would say symptom) of some malfunction of the body, but that any 'knowledge,' obtained through the senses, constitutes "a confused mode of thinking." The Philosophical Writings of Descartes, op. cit., p. 56. 27 Rather than being with Descartes at this point in his argument, Mam ardasvili is closer to Merleau-Ponty's view of the subject who constructs the world through his 'gaze.' Compare Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible, edited by Claude Lefort, translated by Alphonso Lingis,</page><page sequence="28">232 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER Northwestern UP, Evanston, 1968, p. 131 and ff. (Originally published as Le visible et l'invisible, 1964). 28 The term "Bild" used by Wittgenstein can mean image but in the context of the philosophy of language expounded in his Tractatus, it clearly means "model." Thus Wittgenstein says: "We picture facts to ourselves." {Tractatus, 2.1) "A picture is a model of reality." (Tractatus, 2.12) "A picture has logico pictorial form in common with what it depicts." (Tractatus, 2.2) See Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus L?gico-Philosophicus, op. cit. 29 The phenomenon of cogito in "classical rationality" is thus an absolute certainty in the sense that in order to comprehend itself, it does not require anything else to understand itself as itself, ["dannosf soznanija javljaetsja absoljutnoi dostovernostju"]. See R XIII, pp. 14-15. 30 In a conversation with Al?sa, Ivan Karamazov tells his brother stories of child abuse as a sign of protest against the unjust world order, against which Ivan feels powerless because, confronted with it, his 'understanding' fails him. Instead of 'understanding' [ponimanie] (which would make him a Cartesian), Ivan chooses 'knowledge' of 'the facts' [znanie], which makes him a 'modern subject' who lacks being and who does not 'know' (in Lacan's language, a manque-?-?tre and a sujet suppos? savoir]. It is Ivan who gives expression to the founding tautology of this modern subject, when he says to his brother: "My znaem cto znaem." On the problem of Dostoevsky's treatment of "classical knowledge" in his last novel, compare Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, 'The Body and Violence: The Subject of Knowledge in Dostoevsky's The Brothers Ka ramazov and Foucault's Analytic of Finitude,' in: Foucault: The Legacy, edited by Clare O'Farrell, Queensland University of Technology, Kelvin Grove: QUT, 1997, pp. 46-56. On sujet suppos? savoir compare Jacques La can, " The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis," edited by Jacques Alain Miller, translated by Alan Sheridan, W W Norton &amp; Company, New York, London, 1981, p. 232 [first published in French in 1973]; and on manque-?-?tre, a neologism for which Lacan suggested the translation "want to-be," see Jacques Lacan, ?crits: A Selection, translated by Alan Sheridan, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Travistock Publications, New York, London, 1977, p. 170. [Originally published in French in 1966]. 31 Descartes does not privilege the concept of tautology in the theoretical sense it acquires in the 20th century in Wittgenstein's philosophy of lan guage. For example, Descartes speaks of a "useless tautology" in his Second Set of Replies to answer his critics' corruption of his premise 'That which we clearly understand to belong to the nature of something can truly be af firmed of the thing' by way of misunderstanding it as a tautology, viz.: "That which we clearly understand to belong to the nature of something can be truly asserted to belong to its nature.' See The Philosophical Writings of Descartes, op. cit., pp. 106-107. 32 When he speaks of Newton's theory, Mamardasvili circles around the concept of tautology by asserting that such a theory was already the product of Newton's physics. Compare R XIII, p. 33.</page><page sequence="29">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 233 33 This is my free translation or paraphrase of the last two sentences of the first paragraph of R XIII, p. 15. 34 Sixth Meditation, The Philosophical Writings of Descartes, op. cit., p. 54 35 Gary Hatfield, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Descartes and the Meditations, Routledge, London, 2003, p. 124. 36 Compare Derrida's essay "Freud and the Scene of Writing," in Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference, translated by Alan Bass, (London and Henley: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1978), pp. 196-231, especially page 211, where Derrida discusses meaning as something that is always already a "transcription" of a text that is nowhere and never present to itself, "whose signified presence is always reconstituted as deferral, nachtr?glich, belatedly, supplement?rily\ for the nachtr?glich also means supplementary". Peter Rudnytsky generalises Freud's concept of Nachtrag into the "structure of retrospective signification" as the "distinctively psychoanalytic mode of temporality". Peter L. Rudnytsky, Reading Psychoanalysis: Freud, Rank, Ferenczi, Groddeck, Cornell UP, Ithaca and London, 2002, p. 27. Originally Freud spoke of Nachtrag as remembrance of a forgotten part of the dream, which was vital to its subsequent (retroactive) interpretation. See Sigmund Freud, Die Traumdeutung (1900), Studienausgabe Band II, herausgegeben von Alexander Mitscherlich et al., (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Taschen buch Verlag), p. 170 and 499ff. 37 In his structural analysis (in the sense of analysis of structures) of the history of thought or history of discourse, Michel Foucault seeks to de centre the Humanist subject (in the wake of Nietzsche's 'genealogies'), and to uncover the discontinuities that shape human history. See Michel Fou cault, The Archeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language, trans lated by A.M. Sheridan Smith, Pantheon Books, New York, 1972 [originally published in French in 1969]. 38 The term 'Structuralism' is used here in application to Mamardasvili in the sense in which it would apply to Levi-Strauss's anthropology or Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic model of the subject or Lev Vygotsky's psychology of thought and language. In other words, a structuralist is someone who looks at structures and the relations in time and space which generate structures. The term 'structuralism' here is not used in the slightly pejorative and reductionist sense which it has, for instance, in the 'historical' account by Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan, in "Post-Structuralism, Deconstruction, and Post-Modernism," where it is called "a rationalist procedure" related to "the class of 1968." See Literary Theory: An Anthology, edited by Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan, Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, 1998, pp. 338-339. Mamardasvili appears to have understood the term 'Structuralism' in just such a sense, as something that needed to be overcome in the same way as 'formalism.' Compare Merab Mamardasvili, Kak ja ponimaju filosofiju. Edited by Ju. P. Senokosov. Moskva: "Progress", 1990, p. 318. 39 Lacan speaks of "the creative spark of the metaphor" (metaphor being the structure of meaning or sense), which "flashes between two signifier s one</page><page sequence="30">234 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER of which has taken the place of the other in the signifying chain." This mechanism of substitution (of "one word for another"), which is described by Lacan as a somewhat 'occult' process, is responsible for the creation of signification or meaning through which the subject is constituted as a sub ject. See Jacques Lacan, ?crits: A Selection, op. cit., p. 157. 40 Pure difference is theorized by Derrida as the category of thought that, together with the mechanism of deferral (Nachtrag), structures meaning. This is captured in what has been called Derrida's 'master-concept' of differanee (a neologism combining 'difference' and 'd?ferai'). The concept of difference goes back to Ferdinand de Saussure's model of language as a differential system of signs and beyond that to Hegel's original conceptualisation of difference in The Phenomenology of Spirit. Compare Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, translated by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, The Johns Hopkins UP, Baltimore and London, 1976 [originally in French in 1967], Translator's Preface, p. xliii and p. 63 ("Difference is therefore the formation of form."). Compare also Hegel's disquisition on the perception by con sciousness of "different Things," and how a thing establishes its 'oneness' or identity through difference from other Things. G W F Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, op. cit., "A. Consciousness," paragraphs 122-124, pp. 74?75. 41 On world as work in progress ("mir v rabote"), compare R XIII, p. 22. 42 In Classical and Non-Classical Ideals, Mamadasvili makes scant reference to language and speech. This is one instance where he does so in passing, when he speaks of the effects of "psihiki, soznanija i jazykovoj artikuljacii." R XIII, p. 22. 43 In his essay "Ponjatija 'klassiceskogo' i 'neklassiceskog' v filosofii M. K. Mamadasvili," (op. cit., p. 224), Vladimir Kalinicenko illuminates Ma madasvili's non-classical ontology through the key concept of neobratimost' that characterizes perception or cognition of conscious events. 44 Mamardasvili's concept of neobratimost and uniqueness of the act of consciousness resonates with Bahtin's "once-occurent event of being" and the "once-occurent uniqueness or singularity... participatively experienced or lived through." Compare M. M. Bakhtin, Towards a Philosophy of the Act, translation and notes by Vadim Liapunov, edited by Michael Holquist, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1993, p. 13 (originally published as "K filosofii postupka," in Filosofija i sociologija nauki i tehniki: Ezegodnik 1984 85, Nauka, Moskva, 1986, pp. 82-138). As Tapani Laine pointed out to me, Bakhtin's work had not appeared yet when Mamardasvili lectured in Riga in May 1983, and was only published in 1986, after KiNK in 1984. How ever, the "Act" is one of Bahtin's early texts, originating before 1924 and existing in note form, subsequently prepared for publication by Sergei Bo charov. Compare Rethinking Bakhtin: Extensions and Challenges, edited by Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson. Evanston: Northwestern UP, 1989, pp. 5-7. 45 'Maintanace' of a state of consciousness or awareness is one of the themes of Mamardasvili's philosophy, which has been extensively analysed</page><page sequence="31">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 235 by Viktor Vizgin in an article entitled 'Derzanie: metaforika i smysl,' in: Vstreca s Dekartom, op. cit., pp. 151-177. 46 R XIII, p. 28. A term like zivoe sostojanie appears to be an echo Husserl's living present. Compare Edmund Husserl, "Analysis of the Consciousness of Time," in The Essential Husserl, edited by Donn Welton, Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1999, p. 200 (paragraph 25 "The double intentionality of recollection"). 47 This "no place" is like a transcription of Freud's description of the unconscious (das Unbewusste) as "another scene" (ein anderer Schauplatz - a term Freud borrows from G.Th. Fechner), or an "elsewhere." Neither Husserl nor Mamardasvili use the term 'unconscious' although the 'locality' of the phenomenological reduction is obviously commensurate with it. Freud is also keen to maintain a 'dualism' between the notion of the "psychic apparatus," on the one hand, and the "psychic locality," on the other. This distinction is reminiscent of Husserl's antinomies of noema and noesis. Compare Sigmund Freud, Die Traumdeutung (1900), in: Sigmund Freud, Studienausgabe Band II (Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 1982) (Freud Studienausgabe originally 1969-1979), p. 72 and p. 512. 48 Compare Edmund Husserl, 'The Natural Attitude and Its Exclusion,' in Donn Welton (ed.) The Essential Husserl: Basic Writings in Transcendental Phenomenology, Indiana UP, Bloomington and Indianapolis 1999, p. 62. 49 The term 'displaced,' used here by me to translate 'kosvennoe celostnoe' deliberately alludes to the Freudian sense of 'Verschiebung' - displacement, which belongs to the structure of metaphor. 50 Compare R XIII, pp. 43^4. These self-generating objectai formations could be contextualized within the psychoanalytic model of the dream thought (Freud's Traumgedanke), which through the process of conden sation (Freud's Verdichtung), is constituted as a "collective image" (Freud's Sammelbild). Compare Freud's description of the dream about Irma, in Die Traumdeutung, op. cit., p. 294. Although the latter is part of Freud's model of dream thought, he will also say that dream thoughts are "entirely rational" and "have their place among thought processes that have not become conscious - processes from which, after some modifi cation, our conscious thoughts, too, arise." Compare Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, translated and edited by James Strachey, Pen guin Books, 1986 (based on The Standard Edition of the Complete Psy chological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volumes IV and V, Hogarth Press, 1953), p. 649. 51 "Meaning" and "symbolic formations" are, I assume, synonymous and used here by Mamardasvili tautologously, for emphasis. 52 Compare Edmund Husserl, 'The double intentionality of retention and the constitution of the flow of consciousness,' in: The Essential Husserl, op. cit., pp. 216-218, where Husserl tries to define the "flow of consciousness" as a "unity," but a unity "in memory" or in the "intentionality of reten tion," which is a "being-all-at-once" but also "is continuously modified."</page><page sequence="32">236 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER 53 According to phenomenological theory of representation, which overlaps with the psychoanalytic theory of the subject, things we see manifest something that transcends both vision and the consciousness of the one who sees. This is, according to Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the "transcendent invisible" (a theoretical 'descendent' of the phenomenological reduction). This invisible involves the operation of the gaze: "What there is then are not things first identical with themselves, which would then offer themselves to the seer, nor is there a seer who is first empty and who, afterwards, would open himself to them - but something to which we could not be closer than by palpitating it with our look, things we could not dream of seeing 'all naked' because the gaze itself envelops them, clothes them with its flesh." See Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible, edited by Claude Lefort, translated by Alphonso Lingis, North western UP, Evanston, 1968 [first published in French in 1964], p. 131. 54 Thought contents are determined by 'difference' which Mamardasvili incorporates in his ontology. Without 'difference' - or discontinuity - there would be no thought contents. Other than through discontinuity, thought contents are indeterminate. 55 Compare Wittgenstein's understanding of 'logical space' as a grid of understanding which is simply given in perception: "What is the case - a fact - is the existence of states of affairs." [Tractatus, paragraph 2, op. cit.] 'States of affairs' are a generalized logical space in which objects ('facts') can relate to each other in order to form a signifying 'grid.'See Ludwig Witt genstein, Tractatus L?gico-Philosophicus, translated by D.F. Pears &amp; B.F. McGuinness, (Routledge, 1974) [First published in German 1921, in English 1922]. 56 The formulation of the phenomenon as elementary reads like an allusion to Wittgenstein's "simple object" as an elementary sign or name. Compare "The simple signs in propositions are called names." Tractatus, Paragraph 3.203, in: Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus L?gico-Philosophicus, op.cit. 57 Compare Andr? Gide, La porte ?troite [Straight is the Gate], (1909), Mercure de France, 1959. 58 Amongst the post-structuralists, it was Derrida in particular who theo rized about language in the context of a deconstruction of what he called 'the metaphysics of presence.' Compare "Translator's Preface," in Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, op. cit., p. xvii, where Gayatri Spivaks writes, referring to Derrida's appropriation of Freud's unconscious memory trace as an ontological 'absence': "...Derrida's notion of 'sous rature' [under erasure] differs from that of Heidegger's. Heidegger's Being [under erasure] might point at an inarticulable presence. Derrida's trace [under erasure] is the mark of the absence of a presence, an always already absent present, of the lack at the origin that is the condition of thought and experience." 59 See the previous footnote on Derrida. 60 "Clear and distinct" is a formula of understanding or perception often repeated by Descartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy.</page><page sequence="33">CLASSICAL AND NON-CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE 237 61 Compare "We picture facts to ourselves." Tractatus, paragraph 2.1 and "A picture is a model of reality." Tractatus, paragraph 2.12. Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, op.cit. 62 Jung's notion of the archetype sits uncomfortably with the psychoana lytic (Freudian) concept of the unconscious. The latter is an indeterminate and unrepresentable absence or 'gap.' The former is "an irrepresentable, unconscious, pre-existent form that seems to be part of the inherited structure of the psyche and can therefore manifest itself spontaneously anywhere, at any time." C.G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, re corded and edited by Aniela Jane, translated by Richard and Clara Win ston, Collins Fount Paperbacks, 1979 (first published in 1963, originally published under the title Erinnerungen, Tr?ume, Gedanke), p. 411. It is curious that Mamardasvili could entertain an interest in the archetype as something that pre-exists the subject when his philosophical orientation is clearly opposed to any static sch?mas of consciousness. However, an explanation may offer itself if we assume that Mamardasvili used Jung's term as a metaphor, to designate a 'natural attitude' in perception, which distorts objects because their mode of being in the world is counter-intuitive. 63 Compare also Forma prevrascennaja (in Filosofskaja nciklopedija, Volume 5, (Moskva: 1970), pp. 386-389) and its uncut version (in: KJaPF, pp. 315-328) where Mamardasvili refers to both Jung and the example of the 'moving Sun.' 64 The rhizome is a figure of speech used by Deleuze and Guattari to describe a diffuse, indeterminate and dynamic system of subjectivity whose major characteristic is that it is capable of endless transformation. Compare Gilles Deleuze and F?lix Guattari, Capitalism and Schizophrenia: A Thousand Pla teaus, translated by Brian Massumi, (University of Minnesota Press, 1987) (originally Mille plateaux, Volume 2 Capitalisme et schizophr?nie, 1980). 65 Compare, for instance, Derrida's definition of the trace as the instituting category of meaning in: Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology. Translated by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Johns Hopkins UP, 1976, p. 65. 66 Julia Kristeva posits a level in consciousness which she designates with the term "the pre-symbolic semiotic." That is, a region that escapes the "phenomenology and its linguistic substitutes." This semiotic "is articulated by flows and marks: facilitations, energy transfers, the cutting up of the corporeal and social continuum as well as that of the signifying material, the establishment of a distinctiveness and ordering in a pulsating chora, in a rhythmic but non-expressive totality." Julia Kristeva, Revolution in Poetic Language, translated by Margaret Waller, Columbia UP, New York, 1984 (first published in French: La r?volution du language po?tique, 1974). Nota bene: Kristeva uses "non-expressive" somewhat loosely here to stress the fact that the chora displays motility but no signs (or symptoms) that can be 'interpreted.' In other words, the chora is not before or beyond hysteria. 67 Lacan's 'real' is not 'reality,' but one of three 'registers' in which the subject of language and consciousness is constituted: the real, the symbolic</page><page sequence="34">238 SLOBODANKA VLADIV-GLOVER and the imaginary. Lacan's 'real' amounts to an uncanny or occult "object," or Freud's uncanny as object or the unrepresentable limit of language. The 'real' is coeval with the unconscious (das Unbewusste) and with Freud's "non-concept" [Unbegriff]. Compare Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, op. cit., p. 136, 172 and 26. 68 In her excellent study on the concept and function of hysteria in the for mation of subjectivity, Monique David-M?nard 'reduces' Freud's energetic metaphors - metaphors of innervation - for the erotogenic body by looking at the hysterical symptoms which offer access to a "language of discharge" or jouissance [pleasure]. David-M?nard points out that all thought, according to Freud, is "dependent upon jouissance" (which is 'pleasurable' hysteria) and refers to Lacan's (in-)famous analogy between speech and the sexual act: "In other words, for the moment I am not f-cking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were f-cking." Quoted by David M?nard in her Hysteria from Freud to Lacan: Body and Language in Psy choanalysis, translated by Catherine Porter, Cornell UP, Ithaca and London, 1989) (first published in French in 1983), p. 179 in particular. 69 Mamardasvili uses the term "vmestilisce," which I translate as 'receptacle' as an inflection of Kristeva's notion of the 'chora.'
