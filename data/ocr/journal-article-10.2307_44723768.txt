L. Roberts Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan AS PROGRESS IS MADE in the study of vehicle crashworthi- ness and occupant protection, test techniques and devices must keep pace with advances in these fields. The need for test devices of increasing sophistication is great, particularly for devices that simulate the human body. The human head, because of its frequent involvement in fatal injuries, is of prime importance in the development of advanced model test devices. This paper outlines a research program whose goal is to develop a mechanical model of the human head that includes simulation of the skull, brain, dura mater, and scalp. Any mechanical model of a system as complex as the human body is of necessity an approximation of that system. The de- velopment of anthropometric dummies and human simulators over the years has resulted in closer and closer approximations to the human system in many respects (1 , 2)*. The head form shown in Fig. 1 is most commonly used at present in the simu- lation of the human head in impact testing. The head form ♦Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT A variety of mechanical head forms is used today in the eval- uation of the crashworthiness of automotive interiors and the effectiveness of helmet designs. Most head forms are of a very rigid metallic construction, although frangible head forms that indicate skull fracture are presently available. None of the existing head forms can be considered a complete mechanical analog to the human head in terms of mechanical response. This paper describes the initial phases of the development of such a head form. The first step in the development of the model was the de- termination of the pertinent mechanical properties of the tis- sues of the human head (scalp, skull bone, dura mater, and brain). A testing program which determined these properties at both static and dynamic strain rates is described and the re- sults are summarized. The second phase of the program was to find and develop synthetic materials which duplicated the mechanical properties of the human tissues. Many materials were investigated, and modifications to existing materials were made. The synthetic materials were tested by the same methods used in the human tissue tests. Results comparing the synthetic materials with their human tissue counterparts are given. Proposed simple precursor models are described, and a dis- cussion of future, more complex models is given, along with the specific types of head injury phenomena that the model will be required to simulate. 2685</page><page sequence="2">2686 J. W. MELVIN, ET AL. Fig. 1 - Anthropomorphic dummy head form consists of a hollow cast aluminum shell, shaped like the hu- man head, covered with a soft plastic flesh simulation, and ad- justed to weigh the same as its average human counterpart. The only measurement for which the head form is used is head acceleration as determined from the triaxial accelerometer ar- rangement that is rigidly mounted in the cavity of the head form. Recent development of frangible head forms to indicate skull fracture has resulted in a ceramic skull form (2), which simulates the shape of the skull but not the structure of the skull bone, and a composite skull form of reinforced plastic (3), which simulates the structure of the skull bone but not the shape. The frangible head form is an important refinement in head test devices which will allow the evaluation of the ten- dency of impacted structures to produce local skull bone fail- ures that could lead to penetrating brain injuries. As more and more biomechanical data become available from research on experimental head injury mechanisms, the development of a head form that includes a simulation of the brain and other soft tissues of the head will be an important adjunct to both head injury research and occupant impact testing. A research program designed to accomplish this goal has been in progress for the past three years at the Highway Safety Research Institute of The University of Michigan. The method of approach of the program has been: 1 . To determine the basic mechanical properties of the var- ious tissues of the human head using unembalmed test samples obtained at autopsy. 2. To determine the structural behavior of the appropriate tissues. 3. To find or develop synthetic materials which simulate the behavior of the real tissues. 4. The future phase of the program will be to begin develop- ment of the head forms incorporating the results of the initial three phases of the program. For the purpose of this paper, the work will be described in terms of hard tissue basic tests, soft tissue basic tests, struc- tural tests, the search for synthetic materials, and proposed head model development. HARD TISSUE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES The fresh bone specimens used in this study were obtained at autopsy from the University of Michigan Medical Center and the Veterans Administration Hospital in Ann Arbor. The specimens were removed using a Stryker bone plug cutter and Stryker autopsy saw. The plugs taken at the University Hospital were of 0.75-in. diameter and those from the VA Hospital were of 1 .5-in. diameter. Each bone plug removed had a complete record as to sex, age, cause and time of death, and autopsy number. Recording of the autopsy number made it possible to go back to the patient's medical history when desired. Before the plug was removed, a cross (t) was marked on the skull where the plug was to be cut. The vertical line of the cross was in the anterior-posterior plane, and the horizontal line was in the left-right plane, indicating the orientation of the plug after it had been removed. After the plug was re- moved from the skull, the distance was measured from the sagittal, coronal, and/or lambdoidal suture lines to the hole left by the plug. These measurements were then recorded on the data sheet so that the exact location of the plug was known, as well as the orientation. The fresh bone plugs removed at autopsy were placed in a freezer at - 10 C within 30 min from the time of removal. The specimens remained frozen until machined for testing. From experience and data in the literature, it was determined that this was the best method of storing the specimens. A number of test specimens could be cut from each bone plug obtained at autopsy. A second data sheet was maintained for each bone plug to record the work done on each specimen. In the left-hand corner of this data sheet was a circle represent- ing the bone plug. The cross put on the plug at autopsy was then drawn in this circle. As each individual specimen was cut from the plug, the circle was labeled as to the exact area of the plug from which the specimen was cut. The specimens were then machined, using a special jig for holding them. After ma- chining had been completed, they were labeled and either placed in the freezer to await testing or tested immediately. Embalmed bone specimens in the form of whole skull cal- varia were obtained from the Anatomy Department of the University of Michigan Medical School. Skull bone is composed of three layered regions. The outer and inner tables are composed of compact bone, and they are separated by the diploë layer which is a porous form of bone</page><page sequence="3">MECHANICAL MODEL OF HUMAN HEAD 2687 Fig. 2 - Typical compact bone tensile specimen consisting of weblike bars of compact bone known as trabe- cule. In this study, the diploë layer was considered to be a component of skull bone, distinct in mechanical function and form from the compact table layers of bone. Accordingly, dif- ferent tests were used to characterize the two forms of bone in the skull. Based on observations of the modes of failure typi- cal of cranial bone and guided by the technology that has evolved in the analysis of sandwich-type structures for aero- space systems, the compact table material was tested in ten- sion tangent to the skull surface. The diploë layer was tested in compression normal to the surface of the skull and in trans- verse shear tangent to the skull surface. The tests were per- formed at a variety of strain rates using two types of testing machines. The low-speed tests- crosshead speeds up to 20 in./min- were performed on an Instron TTC floor model uni- versal testing machine. The high-speed tests- ram speeds up to 5000 in./min- were performed on a Plastechon 591 U hydraulic servo-controlled high-speed universal testing machine. The tension specimens were made from the compact inner and outer table bone from fresh human bone plugs. The spec- imens were machined from the plugs on a Unimat SL combi- nation lathe and milling machine; care was taken to prevent heating during machining. Because of the curvature of the skull and the thinness of the tables (about 1/16 in.), the fin- ished tensile specimens were quite small (overall length is 0.625 in., gage length is 0.10 in., and the cross section is ap- proximately 0.05 X 0.05 in.). Two metal foil strain gages with 0.0625 in. grid lengths were applied to the specimen with Eastman 910 adhesive. A finished tensile specimen ready for Fig. 3 - Typical porous diploë layer compression specimen testing is shown in Fig. 2. Simple pin grips were used to load the specimen. A seating ball and socket slack mechanism was used to allow the testing machine to reach a constant velocity. Test velocities up to 5000 in./min were used routinely in this test. At test speeds up to 200 in./min, the data were recorded as a load-strain trace with z-axis modulation providing a time base. At higher strain rates, the load-time and strain-time traces were recorded, and the stress-strain curves were obtained by cross plotting. Compression testing was performed mainly on specimens machined with the Unimat SL from the diploë layer of the fresh human skull plugs. The specimens were rectangular, nominally 0.15 in. on a side. The direction of loading was perpendicular to the surface of the skull. The compact table material was removed from the specimens, leaving only the diploë layer which considered for testing purposes to be a ma- terial separate from compact bone. This technique minimized scatter in the data that would otherwise have been present if a two-phase specimen had been tested. A typical specimen is shown in Fig. 3. The specimens were compressed between two platens. The bottom platen was attached to the ram, and the upper platen was a low mass attachment to the load cell. Ini- tially, a strain-gage deflectometer was used to measure relative platen separation, but the low stiffness of the specimens al- lowed ram motion to be used as an adequate indication of de- formation and therefore compressive strain. In order to limit the maximum compressive strain in the high-speed tests, a pos- itive mechanical stop was used to limit ram travel. Shear testing was performed on the diploë layer from both fresh human bone plugs and from embalmed whole calvaria. The test specimen was a circular cylinder about 0.375 in. in diameter taken normal to the surface of the skull. The speci- men was tested in direct transverse shear by using it as a shear pin between two sliding blocks with the diploë layer centered on the sliding plane. One block was attached to the load cell and the other was attached to the ram. A ball and socket slack</page><page sequence="4">2688 J- W.

Maximum shear load was the only recorded data obtained in this test. The results of the tension testing (4) indicate that, unlike compact bone from the long bones of the body, compact skull bone is isotropic in the tangential plane of the skull. The ma- terial was found to be strain-rate sensitive with the average modulus of elasticity varying 1 .8-2.9 X 10** psi and the tensile strength varying 10,000-14,000 psi at strain rates ranging 0.01-100 sec" * . A summary of the tensile properties of skull bone is shown in Fig. 4. The diploë layer testing showed much more variability than the compact skull bone in the test results (5, 6). This was at- tributed to the variable structure of the diploë layer trabe- cule. Using the diploë layer density as an indicator of the structural effects allowed relationships between compressive strength, compressive modulus of elasticity, and shear strength to be determined. Strain rate effects were found to be minor compared with the effect of structure. Fig. 5 shows the rela- tionship found between compressive strength and density. Note that the data range is 1300-31,900 psi. Mean values of properties studied were: Fig. 5 - Compressive strength versus specific weight for diploë layer material 1. Compressive strength- about 6000 psi. 2. Compressive modulus of elasticity- about 2X10^ psi. 3. Shear strength- about 3000 psi. SOFT TISSUE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES BRAIN TISSUE - Determination of the dynamic shear prop- erties of both in vitro human brain, and in vivo and in vitro monkey brain was made in a joint effort with the Dow Corning Corp. (7). Human brain sections, taken at autopsy, were obtained from the Veterans Administration and University of Michigan Hospitals in Ann Arbor. The sections were packed in poly- ethylene bags and placed on ice and water within 10 min after removal from the skull. They were then transferred to Dow Corning within 2.5 hr. Initial tests were run immediately upon receipt. Subsequent storage was at 3 C, since early tests on Rhesus brain had confirmed that gross change occurs in the modulus upon freezing the tissue. The complex dynamic shear modulus (G*) of a viscoelastic material is defined as the vector sum of G' and iG", with G"</page><page sequence="5">MECHANICAL MODEL OF HUMAN HEAD 2689 PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM SAMPLE HOLDER ASSEMBLY FREQUENCY 0SCILLAT0R READOUT SAMPLE COVER PLATE INPUT I " AMPERAGE ( TRANSPARENT) TRANSDUCER " *| READOUT .x FoSINwt y/ SAMPL ł SAMPLE ' / 3L SAMPLE OUTPUT VOLTAGE ( ^ TRANSDUCER [" ļ READOUT 'A,-Mg ROD X SAMPLE BASE PLATE OSCILLOSCOPE [■ PaHwA6SlEe I B Al - Mg ROD SAMPLE STAGE B Í 6 TRANSDUCERS AND VIBRATING MASS ASSEMBLY Fig. 6 - Schematic views of in vitro human brain dynamic shear test apparatus normal to G' G' is the dynamic elastic modulus and is a mea- sure of the spring stiffness of the test material under shear stress. G", the dynamic loss modulus, is a measure of the damping ability of the material and represents viscous losses in the material. The relative damping ability of the material, tan 5, is defined as G"/G'. G* for in vitro brain was determined by applying a dynamic shear stress to the viscoelastic test material and measuring the resulting strain. The dynamic mechanical apparatus (DMA) consisted of a sinusoidally actuated mechanism for shearing the sample and electronic equipment to monitor input force, strain level (output), and the phase angle between them (Fig. 6). The sample shear mechanism was centrally located on a magnesium-aluminum alloy rod which connected twin electro- mechanical transducers. The driving signal, from a function generator operated in the sine mode, was connected to one transducer. The input force was determined by the current to the driving transducer and was adjustable by means of the function generator signal level control. The other transducer provided an output signal, operating as a velocity transducer. Strain and strain rate were measured by output voltage and amplitude. The sample shearing mechanism consisted of a horizontal aluminum base plate rigidly attached to the magnesium- aluminum rod and a clear plastic plate which was positioned above, and parallel to, the aluminum base plate. This plastic plate was rigidly attached to the main structure of the DMA and was vertically adjustable. The test sample was sandwiched between these two plates. The sample section, between the twin transducers, was enclosed in a chamber heated by a small electrical heater-fan system. The temperature was controlled at 37 C by means of a temperature potentiometer which uti- lized an iron-constantan thermocouple placed adjacent to the sample. A total of 13 samples of human brain tissue from eight in- dividuals was tested in vitro utilizing the DMA. All of the samples were cerebral white matter and were tested at 37 C and at 9-10 Hz. The results of these tests indicated that G' lies between 6-1 1 X 10^ dynes/sq cm, G" lies between 3.5-6.0 X 10^ dynes/sq cm, and tan Ô is in the range 0.40-0.55. In order to provide information on time after death effects on the properties of brain and to develop means of extrapolat- ing from in vitro test data to in vivo test data, a dynamic probe apparatus (DPA) was developed at Dow Corning to test both in vivo and in vitro monkey brain. The DPA is essentially a driving point impedance head with a flat-ended cylindrical probe of 0.1 -in. diameter. The impedance head and probe were driven by a small electrodynamic shaker. For in vivo tests, the probe contacted the brain of the anesthetized mon- key through a burr hole in the skull with the dura mater re- moved from the test site. The tests were performed at fre- quencies of 80-100 Hz. The results of 42 tests on six Rhesus monkeys indicate that the in vivo dynamic elastic shear modu- lus G' as calculated from the DPA data lies in the range 3-5 X 10^ dynes/sq cm at 80-100 Hz. The G' of in vitro Rhesus brain, found to be in the same range as human brain, indicates that the combined effect of the living state and higher test fre- quency (80-100 Hz in vivo versus 10 Hz in vitro) produces a somewhat higher dynamic shear modulus than that of in vitro brain. In addition to the dynamic shear modulus of human brain, the bulk modulus of human brain samples was also measured. As might be expected from the high water content of brain, the bulk modulus of human brain was found to be approxi- mately that of water- about 300,000 psi. DURA MATER AND SCALP - Tension tests of fresh dura mater were performed in the Instron universal testing machine. The test specimen is a specially made diimbell shape, 2.25 in. long with a reduced gage length section 0.25 in. wide and 0.75 in. long. This specimen size allowed up to 1 1 specimens to be cut out of a typical sample of dura mater. The dura mąter was obtained at autopsy and placed in a jar of saline solution. If the specimen could not be tested immediately, it was refriger-</page><page sequence="6">2690 J. W. MELVIN, ET AL.

An Instron load cell of 1000 lb capac- ity was used to indicate the load on the specimen; the strain in the specimen was measured by a phototransistorized light ex- tensometer. Two lightweight vanes, attached to the specimen in the test section, blocked a light beam passing from a source to the phototransistor. As the specimen was elongated, the increasing separation of the vanes allowed more of the beam to pass through to the phototransistor. The resulting output of the phototransistor was calibrated against vane separation and permitted measurement of the strain in the specimen inde- pendent of any gripping distortions or slippages. The macrostructure of dura mater, in the regions relatively free from large blood vessels, appeared to be a membrane with evident directions of fiber reinforcement. Further examina- tion indicated that the direction of apparent fiber orientation, when viewed on the outside surface of the material, was differ- ent from that when viewed on the inside. Rough measurement of the angle between these two directions showed it to be about 70 deg. The inner layer of dura mater, which may be peeled off, is much thinner than the remaining dura mater. Because of this highly oriented structure, specimens were taken from the dura mater in three different directions: 1 . Longitudinal- parallel to the sagittal plane. 2. Transverse- perpendicular to the sagittal plane. 3. Diagonal- roughly 45 deg to either of the two directions. The results of over 100 tension tests on dura mater indicated that fiber orientation and strain rate effects were overshad- owed by general variability in the material. The results of one series of tension tests are shown in Fig. 7. The central line for each orientation is the mean stress-strain curve, and the bound- aries represent plus and minus one standard deviation about the mean. Note that a small amount of initial strain occurs with no load, as is found to a much greater extent in skin. Average values of tensile modulus of elasticity lie in the range 6-8 X 103 psi. A limited number of fresh human scalp tests have been per- formed on scalp in radial compression tests on composite samples. The scalp samples were taken at autopsy in the form of a strip about 3 in. long and 0.25-0.50 in. wide. The sample was placed in saline solution and tested immediately or stored in a refrigerator until it could be tested. The specimens were roughly rectangular and their dimensions depended directly on the width of the sample and the thickness of the scalp. The fatty subcutaneous layer was left intact on the specimens. The nominal strain rate in the tests was about 0.2 sec ^ .</page><page sequence="7">MECHANICAL MODEL OF HUMAN HEAD 269 1 1000 - Af 800 - . / 9 TESTS STRAIN RATE ~0.2 sec? / CNJ • / C / Üo J J, 600 - / / IS) / LU / Cd / I- / Ul / g I 400 ~ / / 200 ~ X / o i i i i 1 1 o 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 COMPRESSIVE STRAIN - percent Fig. 8 - Aggregate stress-strain curve for human scalp in radial compression. A- Human scalp; B-Synthetic material An aggregate compressive stress-strain curve for nine tests is shown in Fig. 8. The appreciable strain accumulation with zero or near zero load corresponds to compression of the fatty subcutaneous layer. Also shown for comparison in Fig. 8 is an experimental synthetic material (Tramasaf) developed by General Motors to simulate scalp. The differences in strain at a given stress level between the scalp and the synthetic mate- rial are due to the fact that the Tramasaf material is intended to represent the subcutaneous layer only, while the scalp spec- imens included the stiff epidermal layers. STRUCTURAL TESTS The behavior of the skull as a structure has been studied by means of simple beams machined from skull bone (8) and by whole-skull penetration tests (9). The mechanical response of layered skull bone was studied as an essential step toward the development of head injury models. Analytic mathematical models incorporating skull geometry and constituent material properties were developed for determination of the mechanical response of skull bone. Development of mathematical models was based on available layered beam, plate, and shell theory solutions. Because of their relative simplicity, layered beams are more generally treated by models incorporating properties of the individual layers. Adequate solutions exist for layered plates, using a less specific approach in which a layered plate is represented as a one-layer plate with effective coefficients accounting for the presence of a low-stiffness core between stiffer facing layers. The effective stiffness coefficients must be determined either with layered beam theory or testing. Layered shell theory exists, but no appropriate solutions have been found. Skull bone beams were tested in the bending fixture shown in Fig. 9. Beam samples were machined from embalmed cal- varia and stored in an airtight plastic bag. Beam deflection was determined using a LVDT displacement transducer. From the results of variable span three-point bend tests using the same beam sample, the bending and shear stiffnesses of the skull beam were determined. Test results indicated reasonable agreement with analytical values. Under certain loading condi- tions and diploë layer thicknesses, shear deflections of the diploë layer were found to have significant effects on the over- all bending response of the beams. Localized penetration testing of skulls was performed at three test velocities (0, 10, 20 mph) in order to evaluate the effect of skull structural features on failure modes. Embalmed calvaría were mounted in a shallow dishlike aluminum fixture by embedding the lower edge of the calvarium in a quick- setting dental impression plaster. This technique provided a way to hold the skull rigidly without significantly affecting the</page><page sequence="8">2692 J. W. MELVIN, ET AL. Fig. 9 - Skull bone beam test apparatus (8) state of strain in the test region. The plane of the fixture when mounted on the testing machine ram was approximately 40 deg from horizontal to allow the penetration to be made near the center of the skull bone of interest (parietal or frontal) without influence from the suture areas. Three different pene- trators were used. All three were essentially flat-ended cylin- ders, two were solid in cross section, and one had a hole in its center. The diameters of the solid penetrators were 0.432 and 0.61 1 in., while the outside diameter of the other penetrator was 0.500 in. and the inside diameter was 0.25 in. A pene- trator was mounted in a piezoelectric load cell and impacted by the skull surface in its fixture. The results of the tests indi- cated that the thickness and curvature of the skull influenced the penetration load. One of the most important results of the study, with respect to models of the skull, was that in all cases the failure mode of the skull subjected to such localized pene- tration was a punch-through type of failure closely associated with the layered structure of the skull bone, as shown in Fig. 10.

Nonetheless, some highly suitable mate- rials have been found. It was initially felt that the duplication of the properties of brain tissue would be most difficult because it is so far re- moved from materials of common engineering interest, as shown in Fig. 1 1 . However, modification of existing silicone dielectric gels by Dow Corning has proved to be quite effective in producing a material whose overall response is much like that determined for brain tissue in terms of shear modulus and loss tangent. A duplicate material for skull bone would seem to have been easier than brain because of its closeness to the properties of many engineering materials. However, other considerations must be made in choosing a skull bone substitute material- particularly ease of fabrication. Certainly, short glass fiber re- inforced polyester molding compounds can be produced, which duplicate well the tensile properties of compact skull bone, as shown in Fig. 12. These materials, however, must be formed using high-pressure molds to achieve the desired prop- erties, and such molds are expensive. For the purpose of model development involving complex shapes, it would be of great value to find a material which would simulate compact skull bone using low-pressure molding techniques.

Simulation of dura mater is important primarily in terms of matching the stiffness of the material, as long as the strength is at least as great as that of the real tissue, since dura mater is rarely, if ever, torn under closed head injury conditions. Sili- cone network polymers have been studied by Dow Corning which bracket the range of observed values of modulus of elasticity and strength of dura mater. Since the main concern of this program has been injury to the skull and to the brain, the properties of scalp have been of secondary concern. However, it is evident from Fig. 9 that for radial compression the Tramasaf simulation of subcutaneous scalp is quite reasonable. The search for the best simulation for each of the tissues is far from over and may well be a constant search as new forms of materials become available in the future. HEAD MODEL DEVELOPMENT Following the development of suitable synthetic materials to substitute for the tissues of the head will be the development of a variety of models of the head, These models will serve two purposes: head injury research and head simulation for crash protection studies. The development of these two types of models will probably be concurrent. Development of head models of this sort should be a series of steps of increasing complexity. Certainly the most obvious first model might be a spherical shell with the equivalent shell stiffness of a layered skull structure filled with a simulated brain material. This model would serve as a starting point for the interpretation of the effects of direct impact and rotation on the motion of the brain and the stresses produced in the brain. Subsequent models of more complex shape and detail could be used in work parallel to experimental head injury studies in the Rhesus monkey, for example. Here an adjunct model of the experimental animal, with reproducible properties and geometry and repeatable test conditions, could serve as a valuable aid in the interpretation of the data observed in the experimental animals. It would be possible to refine the detail of the model in conjunction with the test results to duplicate, for instance, the effect of the dura mater and the bridging veins on the production of subdural hematomas. The interac- tion between experimental head injury studies and model studies would point to deficiencies in the model and would further serve to produce more refined models of the head. The incorporation of advanced head models in selected types of occupant protection studies would provide additional input to the model development and would provide refinement as the model behavior is compared with field results. A third type of model of the head is the mathematical model, rather than the mechanical model. The mathematical model allows bypassing the search for synthetic materials by incor- porating the mechanical properties of the tissues of the head directly in its analysis. Such models are now being worked on, but they are subject to severe restrictions in terms of the geom- etry of the model and the types of loading. The progress made in mathematical modeling may best be evaluated by comparing the results of equivalent mechanical model experi- ments with the prediction of mathematical models. CONCLUSIONS The mechanical properties of the constituent materials of the human head have been determined in sufficient detail to begin the development of synthetic materials to simulate their behavior. Following the development of suitable materials, some of which are now available, mechanical models of the human head with simulated skull, brain, dura mater, and scalp will be of great value in both experimental head injury studies and in occupant crash protection studies.
