<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUKE—ACTS AND THE IMPERIAL CULT IN ASIA MINOR* ι.ι. Why did Luke reshape Christian eschatology so that he could defer the expectation of the day of judgement to an indefinite future (Luke 21:24d; Acts 1:7)? 2. Why, furthermore, did Luke, a deutero-Paulinist in the generation after the death of his com munity's founding apostle, and writing for a Gentile audience, stress that Christianity was the fulfilment of Judaism in a way that was even more sympathetic to the latter than Paul's final position in Rom. 9-12? The traditional answer to 2 has been that Luke's two-volume work was intended to be an ecumenical document, reconciling differences between Paul's churches and the original Jerusalem community. We could respond by pointing out that Paul never really attacked Judaism in the way this view presupposes, but in fact stressed its continuity with Christianity in terms of fulfilment. Moreover, the traditional answer does not explain why Luke should stress that continuity when writing for a Gentile audience. At all events, the emphasis on differences between Paul and the Jerusalem community, allegedly transcended by Luke, has always been suspect in terms of historical method. Such a view implies that late-first century communities developed according to the logic of their internal discourse in a way that was only minimally historically related to the development of wider, pagan culture.' More recent literature has, moreover, acknowledged that Israel is recognized in Luke—Acts in a way that surpasses even Paul as the necessary precursor to Christianity.2 Luke 1-2 locates the origins of Christianity in the circle of priests and prophets of the Jerusalem Temple such as Zachariah and Anna. In order to explain such features in Luke Houlden is led to postulate the existence of 'pre-Marcionite Marcionites' against whom the * A first draft of part of this paper was originally given to the Cambridge Patristics Seminar (11.3.96), and I am grateful for the comments of Drs J.

I propose instead to claim the fulfilment of the objects of republican religion by Augustus as the real counterfoil to Luke's picture of Christianity as Temple Judaism fulfilled. The traditional answer to 1 is that the delay of the Parousia caused Luke to reshape primitive eschatology so as to provide a space for the Church in normal history.4 But a phenomenon such as Montanism or other millenarianist groups demonstrates that the delay of the Parousia did not of itself necessarily produce such a perceived need for a space for the Church in normal history. Esler's recent study into the immediate historical and social background to Luke-Acts has focused on the need to replace the thesis of Luke-Acts as apologia, founded on the dubious legal notion of the quest for status as a religio licita, with a thesis about legitimation.5 Focusing on Luke's gospel in the present article, I wish to argue that the legitimation thesis is only partially true and possibly misleading. Legitimation in sociological discourse norm ally refers to the way in which one group, in its own self-interests, justifies its privileged position in power relations to another. I wish to emphasize rather that the theology of Luke is a political theology in terms of which Theophilus and his group did not simply justify their position to others but to themselves. The immediate historical and social context in which Theophilus and his circle found themselves was one in which the values of Imperial Order were reflected in the developing Imperial Cult in Asia Minor. That continuing development reinforced, under Domitian in the last quarter of the first century, the ideology of a religious reformation that had accompanied a political revolu tion from 31 bc onwards.6 That religious reformation emphasized 3 Houlden (1984), p. 62.

Christianity, as commended by Luke to Theophilus' circle, was Judaism fulfilled.7 But Luke envisaged that fulfilment, to use Bovon's phrase, as 'une contrepartie religieuse' specifically to the religious claims implied by Augustus' constitutional reforms. But it was not simply a general parallel with Imperial universalism, as Bovon claimed.8 We need, as recent classical scholarship sug gests, to take the imperial cult seriously as a religious phenomenon against the view, attributed by Etienne to Latte, that it was 'une invention des peres de l'Eglise'.9 Theophilus' circle inherited the values of an imperial order and peace that bore the form of a Stoic metaphysics in which nature and society were one. Its members accepted the imperial values, deified as Virtues, of Victoria, Pax, Concordia, Salus etc., since they had been conditioned socially to take seriously the claim that an originally imperfect republican religious cultus had been reformed and perfected by the Augustus as princeps. In con sequence of that social conditioning, they shrank with horror at the prospect of a return to civil chaos marked by the events that led to Actium (31 bc), which they saw as the culmination of a century of increasingly devastating civil wars. Under the influence of such a historiography of decline, they experienced the metaphysical terror associated with the ira as opposed to the pax pax deorum. Luke's solution was to encourage them to see Christianity as the fulfilment of Judaism which paralleled Augustus' fulfilment of that to which the religious practices of Republican magistrates 7 F.

The Order of the Christian community, constituted by an apostol ate whose κοινωνία continued the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus along with the breaking of bread (Acts 2:42), was the true means of producing the pax dei, in contrast to Augustus' pax deorumdeorum (the ίπι γής/kv ουράνιο Αρήνη־, Luke 2:24; 19:38). Here we find, in the context of imperial order, a refashioned Christian version of the Augustan saeculum aureum. Consequently Luke 1-2 reshaped the themes of tribulation, chaos, and judgement in prim itive Christian eschatology so as to produce, for Theophilus' circle, a Christian, present and future counterpart to the imperial peace, and the religious means for securing this. Although I believe that this case holds equally for Acts as well as the Gospel, I propose confining my remarks in this paper almost exclusively to the latter, for the sake of space. Let us now examine how my case will hold for the Gospel. Ι.I. AUGURY, THE AUGUSTAN REVOLUTION AND THE SAECULUM AUREUM Pax,Pax, in the words of Tacitus (Ann. 1) written c. ad 115, required a princeps after a century of civil discord marking the failure of Republican, constitutional government. The inevitable character of that failure was the common historiographical construction of his contemporaries. But it is important that we do not secularize or demythologize the concept of pax thus achieved. The princeps was not to be justified in terms of the utility of a single ruler harmonising a state machine from which divine life was absent. The consuls under the republican government had religious as well as political responsibilities. Civil disorder, defeat against external foes etc. were reflections of cosmic disorder. Throughout his history of Rome, Livy repeatedly lists in lurid detail portents and prodigies calling for expiation by the Roman magistrates through their presidency over the rites of augury.10 The peace of nature was of a piece with the peace of society. In such a matrix we find also the republican origin of the cult of virtues in which as a result of the restoration of both the social and natural order the virtues of Victoria, Pax, Concordia, Salus, Fortuna, etc. ceased to be abstractions and were given a concrete divine shape.11 Cicero makes it clear that the intellectual justification of the 10 Livy 1,20,7; 4,21,5; 5,14,4; 5,15,1; 24,10,13; 27,37,6-8; 41,16,6, etc. and Julius Julius Obsequens. 11 Livy 35,9,6 (Victoria); 9,46,6; 24,22,1; 24,22,13; 26,23,4 (Concordia); 2,40,12; 23,19,18; 43,13,4 (Fortuna); 9,43,25, (Salus) etc., cf. J. R. Fears, 'The Cult of Virtues', ANRW 2,17,2 (1981), 827-948.</page><page sequence="5">LUKE-ACTS AND THE IMPERIAL CULT 415 republican practice of augury and the taking of auspicia by elected magistrates was to be found in Stoicism.12 It was in terms of Stoic metaphysics that the political and constitutional requirements which a magistrate like Cotta found so bewildering could be intelligibly explained. One could therefore read the future, ration ally determined by the λόγος ΐνδιάθετος, on the lining of a sheep's stomach or in the flight of birds.13 The cultic acts performed to secure this objective were justified in terms of reintegrating the chaotic natural and social order into the harmonious meta physical Order. The final breakdown of Republican peace which the constitution could not prevent was therefore to be mirrored in the final break down of a republican religion which could not maintain the pax deorutn.deorutn. The cultic religious acts of republican magistrates were finally to be found to have been as ineffective as their religious ones. The pax deorum, like the civil peace, had lasted under the republic only for a time and on an ad hoc basis. Lucan in Pharsalia, 1, 1, 1, 522-605, written shortly before ad 65, describes the natural turmoil of the civil war but also emphasizes its supernatural coun terpart. The chaos of society was mirrored in a chaos in nature marked by monstrous prodigies, 'which nature, at variance with herself, had brought forth (discors protulerat natura)' (589-90). Clearly the ratio or λόγος that follows a progression of ordo was not now present in an upset pax of Nature. It is against such a backcloth of cultic republican failure that we should understand the reorganization of the state religion around the figure of Augustus as Pontifex Maximus in the Res Gestae.Gestae. The reformed republic has as its counterpart a reformed religion. In Res Gestae 13 the closing of the Temple of Janus for a third time indicated a remarkable peace. But Dio has a most significant commentary on the significance of this event. Dio 37,25, ι records the failure to obtain successfully the augurium salutis,salutis, during the first triumvirate in 63 bc due to the occurrence of too many unlucky omens. Only when the senate closed the gates of the temple of Janus under Augustus as augur was the ritual successful (51,4). Thus the religious achievement of Augustus is an act of successful augury that had failed under the Republic. Indeed Suetonius Augustus 7 claimed that in augurium was the significance of Augustus' name. The erection of the Ara Pads is to be seen therefore in the 12 See De Nat. Deor. 2, 2-4; De Divinatione, 2,74. 13 See J. von Arnim, Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta (Leipzig: Teubner, 1923), II, 135 (Galen) abd 318 (Origen); Diogenes Laertius, Succ. 7,150 (Apollodorus and Chrysippus).</page><page sequence="6">416 ALLEN BRENT context of securing pax through an extraordinary act of augury. Res Res Gestae 12 records the erection of an altar not simply to Pax but to Pax Augusta. The iconography of the altar's relief shows 'the epiphany of Pax, Felicitas, Concordia and Pietas in the person of Augustus and his restoration of the Roman and universal order'.14 An extraordinary pax deorum was required by the extra ordinary convulsion of nature as well by the convulsion of society in the civil war. Augustus achieved this extraordinary pax through his association with these divine entities, derived from the cult of virtues, and held to reside exclusively in himself alone. Tiberius was to provide the final consummation of this development in ad io, when he rededicated the temple of Concordia specifically as the Concordia Augusta. We find such adjectival qualifications such as Juno Sospita or Janus Quirinus now being applied so as to designate the Emperor's person 'as the sphere, functional or tern poral, in which the deity has manifested her characteristic power'.15 From Tiberius onwards we find examples of the con tinued qualification of each individual deity in the cult of virtues so as to appropriate them to the godhead of the Imperial Cult. Such virtues had thereby ceased to be separate divinities, but now became as it were simply persons within the corporate godhead of the divine Emperor. The transformation of society was to be accompanied by a transformation of nature into a saeculum aureum. Virgil's fourth Eclogue, written in the consulship of Asinius Pollio (40 bc), had referred originally to the expected child of Octavian and Scribonia as the divine child whose birth would be accompanied by a miracu lous transformation of nature.16 By the time that Virgil had written GeorgicsGeorgics 1,24-42 (29 bc) he had become friend of Maecenas and member of his circle around Octavian.17 Clearly here the puer has become identified with Octavian himself, whose birth was respons ible for the pax deorum shown in the natural order in which earth yielded its bounty, and who, like the puer of Eclogue 4,17, would rule the globe (reget patriis virtutibus orbem). Octavian, when 14 Fears (1981) 885. 15 Fears (1981) 886. 16 C. Bailey, Religion in Virgil (Oxford: Clarendon, 193s), p. 192, saw it purely in terms of the expected heir of Octavian. A. J. Boyle, The Eclogues of Virgil: Translated Translated with Introduction, Notes, and Latin Text (Melbourne, Hawthorn Press, 1976), p. 113 lists other possibilities as (i) hoped-for child of Anthony and Octavia (sister of Octavian); (ii) Asinius Gallus, Pollio's baby; (iii) Aion Hellenistic god of time and renewal; and (iv) Marcellus, Octavia's son by a previous marriage.

He would be welcomed as such by the 'great world (maximus orbis)' (I. 26). In Aeneid 6,791-94 Virgil finally identified Augustus as the bringer of the saeculum aureum. Thus, the golden age prophesied in Virgil Eclog. 4, and inaugur ated, with its characteristics such as Fortuna, Providentia, Salus, Concordia,Concordia, Pax, Victoria etc., can be located as flowing from the divinity of the Emperor. But the main focus of the Imperial Cult is not imperial worship itself but an extraordinary act of augury which produced these qualities, not as transient states to be lost again as under republican magistrates, but everlastingly. They produced not just fortuna, providentia salus etc. for next year alone, but for a golden age, a saeculum aureum that was in process of birth. The cult of Roma, originating in the Hellenistic East, could now be assimilated in the West to the Imperial Cult, and the personality of individual emperors could now be identified with the corporate personality of the Roman Empire itself.18 Augustus and his successors are thus made the sacramental sign by virtue of which the golden age has returned, and by which its continuance is guaranteed. But such a state of peace and felicity does not simply require the presence of the Emperor, but also his performance of cultic, sacramental, and augural acts. Augustus was to celebrate such messianic and augural themes in connection with his own person in the iconography of his monuments. From 19 bc we find such examples as portrayals of Capricorn with a cornucopia of plenty together with, in some issues, the augur's lituus. On the Gemma Augustea at Vienna there is commemorated the scene in ad 12 when Tiberius threw himself at Augustus' feet, on return from Germany, whilst the former was presiding over the ceremonies.19 Roma appears alongside rep resentations of Victoria, Oikumene, and Tellus. Alongside Roma sits Augustus with the cornucopic sign of Capricorn over his head, and in his right hand is the lituus. Fortuna is depicted crowning him. The divine augur has issued in the golden age as he sits already amongst the gods and looks down on lesser mortals.20 18 R. Mellor, 'The Goddess Roma', ANRW 2,17,2 (1981), 984-98 ff. 19 Suetonius, Tibenus, 20: Ac prius quam in Capitolinium fleeteret, descendit e curru seque praesidenti patriseque praesidenti patriseque praesidenti patri ad genua summisit.

Thus the reorganization of the cultus over which Augustus and his successors were to hold the power of pontifex maximus now makes the imperial ruler the mediator of metaphysical order and thereby peace. Lucan well understood the Stoic justification for imperial order in these terms when he could dispense with the trappings of divinities and express Augustus' revolution purely in terms of Stoic fatalism and a demythologized metaphysics.21 The notions of ειρηνή, σωτηρία, ομόνοια etc., well known in a republican context, had been given a new and concrete focus in Augustus and the saeculum aureum that he inaugurated, as had the old republican cult of virtues.22 It was such qualities, personal ized as it were in the collective personality of the Emperor, that gave rise to such celebratory inscriptions as the Koinon of Asia's decree in 9 bc. Here Augustus is described as the one whom 'Providence (Πρόνοια) granted to us as our saviour (ώσ7rep ήμειν και και τοις μεθ' ημάς σωτήρα χαρισάμενη) who has made war to cease and ordered the world with peace (τον παύσαντα μεν πόλεμον, κοσμήσοντακοσμήσοντακοσμήσοντα δε είρήνην)'.23 Furthermore, Lucan's natura discors set right is commemorated in his description of a world 'in a fallen condition and restored to a fortunate condition that he has set right (ε'ί γε ουδέν ουχί διαπεΐπτον και ε'ις ατυχές μεταβεβηκός σχήμα ανώρθωσεν)'ανώρθωσεν)'ανώρθωσεν)' .24 We have examples too from Sardis between 5-2 BC, and Gytheion in Lacaonia in Tiberius' reign, and may note further examples in the case of Antiochus IV and Julius Caesar.25 for mankind ... Flanked by Roma and crowned by Fortuna, the emperor holds in his right hand the lituus, the medium through which the will of the gods is manifest in his person and the emblem of those auspices by which Tiberius has triumphed'. 21 F. M. Ahl, Lucan: An Introduction (Ithaca and London: Cornell, 1976) remarks perceptively, p. 283: 'The role of the gods in traditional epic is superseded by a kind of Stoic hylozoism; the Olympians yield to the workings of natural phenomena.

Only Augustus could bring the permanency of 'the age to come' (Heb. 6:5). It is against the backcloth of the concept of a saeculum aureum, inaugur ated by Augustus' religious fulfilment of an imperfect republican cultus, and his extraordinary act of augury, that the social back ground to Luke—Acts is to be understood. II.II. SAECULUM AUREUM: ESCHATOLOGY OF THE INFANCY NARRATIVES Luke saw that Theophilus and his circle needed to legitimize their new faith, not so much in order to offer an apologia to others, but to themselves, in terms of their own cultural background. That background had produced in them a shuddering loathing of disorder, whether religious or metaphysical.26 Not simply the Dionysiac Riot at Rome (Livy 39,14-16), but the collectively remembered century of civil war, had been interpreted by that culture in terms of a chaotic civil order that reflected a disturbed metaphysical order. Roman republican religion had been shown to be weak and imperfect, and to need the fulfilment of the pax that it promised by an Augustus who could secure it. The augur's wand of Augustus on the Gemma had produced both civil and metaphysical pax through an extraordinary religious act. How could Theophilus and his circle reassure themselves and each other that their new faith was no threat to what was not only a political achievement in restoring civil order, but a religious achievement securing peace in the metaphysical order of things? That reassurance was given to them by Luke in consequence of his recasting of the tradition. In his Gospel, he emphasizes continually the fact that what took place in Jesus was the continua tion and fulfilment of what was written in the Old Testament. But we shall argue that, however necessary this emphasis on the fulfilment of the Old Testament was for Luke's account, it is not sufficient as an explanation of what has shaped his narrative. We shall point to specific features of the narrative which reflect the ideology of the imperial cult, and its fulfilment of the saeculum aureum aureum that has led to the selection and association of similar Old Testament themes so as to produce a new legitimation of 26 In a similar context as Theophilus and trading on imperial images of Order, Clement Cor. 2,6 asserts: 'All insurrection (πάσα στάσις) and all division (και πάν σχίσμα)σχίσμα) is to be abominated by you (βδελυκτόν ύμϊν)\ βδβλυκτός is an expression evocative of cultic associations in terms of sacrilegious defilement.</page><page sequence="10">420 ALLEN BRENT Christianity for Theophilus and his circle. Such themes as nature and society at peace through the birth of a divine child, with residual themes of judgement and cataclysm placed in the back ground, reflect Luke's imposition of the formal template of the imperial ideology on his traditional material. I will begin with the selection and association of Old Testament themes in a way that is conditioned by the imperial ideology (11,1), and continue with a further example (the census) which is derived directly from that ideology alone without an Old Testament background (11,2). II,II,II, 1. The Fulfilment of Eschatological Promise An emphasis on tribulation and cataclysm would be as irrelevant to the scenes of chapters 1—2 as were the fasces omitted from the AraAra Pads in the golden age of peace and supernatural abundance that it depicts, or indeed as it would be in Virgil's fourth Eclogue. For Theophilus' circle ΐΐρψη km τής γής (Luke 2:14; 19:38) was the Christian counterpart to Augustus' augurium salutis (to οΐώνίσμαοΐώνίσμα της vyeias). The first announcement of the Christian golden age is made through the birth of John the Baptist, but without his emphasis on judgement (Luke 1:15—17 cf. 3:7—14). The births of both John and Jesus are announced in the context of the temple worship and its priest (Zachariah) and prophet (Anna). The announcement of John's birth to Zachariah took place in the Temple at the altar of incense (Luke 1:5-25). The announcement of the golden age is made through the medium of hymns (Magnificat, 1:46—55, BenedictusBenedictus 1:68-79), like the Carmen Saeculare of Horace. But given that it is from Christianity as Judaism fulfilled that the hope of a golden age arises, in what terms is such an age expressed, which like Augustus through his augurium pads, Jesus will usher in? We shall now see the close connections between the imagery of the various hymns and that of the Imperial Cult. //,j.j. Ε'ιρψη, σωτήρ and the pax dei in Luke-Acts We have already drawn attention to the way in which such virtues as Ε'ιρψη-Ραχ, 'Ομόνοια-Concordia are not merely inde pendent deities but are associated, as they had been from Sulla's time, with the personality of the imperator. It was necessary there fore now to have the Augustan presence in order to secure the saeculumsaeculum aureum in which these virtues would be realized. Similar themes are now reflected in the special time that has come round, the kviavTov Κυρίου 8εκτόν which, in the author's own special</page><page sequence="11">LUKE-ACTS AND THE IMPERIAL CULT 421 additions to Mark and Q, is what Jesus begins his ministry by 'heralding (κηρύξαι)' (Luke 4:19). This passage by itself parallels the imperial cult without there existing any necessary connection between such a contingent and parallel theme. The reference is to the freeing (λύτρωσις) of the land every fiftieth year, the year of Jubilee (Lev. 25:10). But like Augustus, and unlike Old Testament forshadowings, the ΐνιαυτόν Κυρίου Κυρίου δεκτόν and the consequent λύτρωσις is made dependent for its fulfilment on a unique person, Jesus. Σωτηρία Σωτηρία was another of the virtuous conditions associated with the extraordinary pax deorum which Augustus as augur was to achieve. Zachariah prophesies on the birth of John his son the fulfilment of the promised λύτρωσις in that God has 'raised up the horn of salvation for us (σωτηρίας ήμΐν)' (Luke 1:69). Here again σωτηρία σωτηρία has an Old Testament background where such phrases as 'salvation from our enemies (σωτηρίαν ίξ ίχθρών)' (1:71) are derived from 2 Sam. 22:3, and Ps. 17:18-19. In preparing the way for the Lord, John is 'to give knowledge of salvation (τοΰ δούναι, γνώσιν σωτηρίας)σωτηρίας) to his people (τώ λαώ αυτού) in the forgiveness of their sins (kv αφΐαΐΐ αμαρτιών)' (1:77). Here also the Old Testament background reveals a fulfilled Judaism which parallels the imperial ideology but shows no necessary connection with it. But when we turn to Luke's association of the divine plan (πρόγνωσις,(πρόγνωσις, βουλή) with themes of σωτηρία and σωτήρ, we go beyond a merely contingent parallelism towards a more positive connec tion. Squires has emphasized the at least partial roots of Luke's concept of providence with the way that προνοία is used in Hellenistic universal histories such as Diodorus Siculus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus.27 But there is a more direct connection in the association of προνοία with σωτήρ in the ideology of the Imperial Cult. It is this association in the template of imperial ideology that arguably determines Luke's association of such Old Testament themes, as he constructs these around Jesus as σωτήρ. We note from the Koinon of Asia's decree in 9 bc the description of Augustus as the one 'Providence (Πρόνοια) granted to us as our saviour (ώσπ€ρ ήμΐΐν και τοις μΐθ' ημάς σωτήρα χαρισαμένη) who has made war to cease and ordered the world with peace (τόι׳ παύσαντα μένμέν πόλίμον, κοσμήσοντα δι (Ιρήνην)'.2s Luke's passage continues: 'through the compassion of our God, in which the dawn (ανατολή) from on high has visited us, 27 J.

Luke 1:78-79. The feeling of gloom and despondency, of darkness and the shadow of death, is not to be attributed to an expression of the feeling of Israel under enemy occupation. Were that the focus of these sentiments, they would not have been included in this highly crafted literary text addressed to Theophilus, a Roman of some rank, as is shown by his being addressed as 'Your Excellency (κράτιστε(κράτιστε Θεόφιλε)'.29 The theme is not of revolutionary chaos or natural convulsion but of a golden age of order and guidance (κατευθϋναι)(κατευθϋναι) and peace (είς όδόν ειρήνης). There are no concessions here to the traditional eschatological themes, found in Mark 13 and Luke 21:7-28. The άπολΰτρωσις of 21:28, set in the context of the 'signs in the sun and moon ... distress of nations in perplex ity at the roaring of the sea and the waves, men fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken' (vv. 25—26), is clearly different from the context of the λύτρωσις of 1:68 which is set in the context of άφεσις and ειρήνη (1:77-79). The sense of ττρονοία in the 'destiny {ή προνοία) which fulfils the prayers of all'30 is reflected in the homily attributed to Peter in Acts 2:23, in terms of Luke's favoured use: πρόγνωσις and βουλή. Jesus' betrayal by Judas and the Crucifixion is 'by the pretermined counsel (τή ώρισμένη βουλή) and foreknowledge (προγνώσει) of God'. In the proconsul of Asia's letter, it is fitting that Caesar's birthday should mark the entry of magistrates into office, since this 'signifies (δηλονότι) of the rank thus marked out (όντως της τάξεως τάξεως προτετυπωμένης) that it is according to a divine wish (κατά τίνα τίνα θείαν βοΰλησιν)' .31 According to Acts 2:22, Jesus is 'a man depicted (άποδεδειγμένον) by God to you by miracles and wonders 29 Luke 1:3.

But it is now accepted that it is found with wider application ... and so its use does not prove that Theophilus was a Roman official'. But Luke uses this word in only one other place, Acts 23:25, where Claudias Lysias addresses his letter: τω κρατίστω ήγ€μόνιήγζμόνι Φήλικι. Clearly Luke understands this term as that of a high ranking official, and therefore in a sense consistent with IGIS 614, 4-5 (Governor of Arabia); 629,168 (Corbulo); 667,4 (prefect of Egypt); Josephus, Antiqu. 20,12 (Governor of Syria).

His entry into office, as it were, through the resurrec tion is here viewed as part of the divine plan or purpose. In the letter of the proconsul of Asia in 9 bc, Augustus accomp lished the 'setting right (άνώρθωσεν)' of a world whose 'form has changed into ill-fortune (els ευτυχές μεταβεβηκός σχήμα)' by the 'good fortune (ευτύχημα)' of his birthday (γενέθλιος ημέρα).32 That 'setting right (άνώρθωσεν)' was associated conceptually with Augustus' augural act in producing an extraordinary pax deorum. In Luke 1:79 there is a similar 'setting right' in connection with ειρήνηειρήνη or pax brought about in preparation for the γενέθλιος ημέρα of Jesus, in the description of John as 'guiding (κατευθϋναι) our feet into the way of peace (els όδόν ειρήνης)'. The healing of a crippled woman can be described as 'being set right' (or stood upright upright = άνωρθώθη), uniquely in the New Testament, in Luke 13:13· Furthermore those 'seated in darkness and in the shadow of death' in Luke 1:79 are members of the world described in the proconsul of Asia's letter as one that 'would have gladly welcomed its destruction (ήδιστα αν δεξάμενω φθοράν)' 33 The birth of Augustus had been the 'beginning of the good life of nature and of society (αρχήν τοΰ βίου και τής ζωής), which is the end and limit of feeling regret (του μεταμέλεσθαι)' .3Λ Likewise in the angels' song to the shepherds, peace (εΙρήνη) is announced 'upon earth amongst men with whom God is well pleased (εν άνθρώποις ευδοκίας)' (Luke 2:14).35 Finally, Symeon in the Nunc Dimittis links his departure 'in peace (εν ειρήνη)' with 'thy salvation (το σωτήριόν σου)' (2:29(2:29 30). But the presence of salvation, peace, and the saeculum aureum was associated according to Virgil's Fourth Eclogue with the birth of a child who (1. 15) possessed the 'life of the gods (deum vitam)', and, come Georgics 1,24-42 and Aeneid 6,791-94, the divine per sonage is Augustus Caesar, genus divi, qui condet saecula aurea. Augustus moreover was filius dei since he was not only Caesar's son but also of the gens Julia whose divine ancestor had been Venus. It would be quite wrong to underrate the strong religious impression made by such expressions and attributes on the way in which the Emperor was regarded in Asia Minor in the late first century.36 Let us now examine the Lukan parallels with such 32 Ibid. no. 98 (a) line 6. 33 Ibid, line 8. 34 Ibid, line 10-11. 35 See also Nilsson (1974) 371. 36 Thus I find quite facile Jones (1992) pp. 108-109, where he regards Domitian's divine appelation as: 'all but incredible ...

Once again we shall note that it is the imperial ideology that controls his selection of Old Testament themes and provides the pattern into which he fits them. 11,1.2. 11,1.2. 11,1.2. The Virgin Birth and Jesus as Son of God (Luke 2:26-35) 2:26-35) The author of Luke-Acts did not invent the story of the Virgin Birth. A variant of that same tradition is found in Matt. 1:18-25, but there are significant differences. First, in Luke 1:32 what Mary is to conceive is to be called 'Son of the Highest (υιός ΰφίστου)', and therefore Son of God already by conception. Moreover this title is linked not only with the 'throne of David his Father' but also with an everlasting kingdom: 'He will rule over the house of Jacob forever', and 'of his kingdom (της βασιλείας αυτού) there shall be no end (ουκ εσται τέλος)'τέλος)' (1:32-33)· In Matt. 1:18-25 this connection with an ever lasting kingdom is not made. Jesus is referred to simply as 'king of the Jews' in the question of the Magi (2:1-2). The adoration of the Magi foreshadows the homage of the Gentiles to be given to Israel's Messiah. Mary is to have a child and 'what is begotten (γεννηθέν)(γεννηθέν) is of the Holy Spirit (εκ πνεύματος εστίν άγιου)' (1:2ο). His name, Jesus, implies that 'he shall save (σώσει) his people from their sins' (1:21). Matthew uses the verb σώσει (Matt. 1:21b) rather than the Augustan title αωτήρ which, as we have seen, is used by the author of Luke-Acts. The child is born in Bethlehem (the city of David) (2:5-6). In Matthew what is γεννηθέν εκ πνεύμα το? ... αγίου is not connected with the title υιό? του θεού. The child 'begotten of the Holy Spirit' is a miracle that indicates Mary's purity, so that Joseph shall not 'put her away' (1:19-20), and simply fulfils a messianic prophecy (Isa. 7:14) about a virgin and a child called Emmanuel (1:22-23). YVs τοϋ θεού is therefore not connected in Matthew with the mode of Christ's virginal birth nor with the golden age as in both Augustan literature and in Luke-Acts. Jesus is called 'Son of God' in Matt. 2:15, but, as with the divine voice at his baptism in Matt. 3:17 (cf. Mark 1:11), the title has the sense of adoption rather than birth, in allusion to the adoption of Israel in Hos. 11:1 or the king as Israel' represent ative in Ps. 2:7. Thus in Matthew no conclusion is drawn from autocrat hardly constitute proof that they were instructed or required to use them ...'. I have followed here the thesis of Price (1984) and Fishwick (1987) that it is wrong to secularize Roman politics and to marginalize the religious dimension in this way. See also K.

The adoption of the Augustan equa tion, genus divi =filius dei who brings the saeculum aureum is made by the author of Luke-Acts alone. Mary asks how this can be since she has no carnal knowledge of a man (Luke 1:34), and therefore invites Gabriel's rather clinical and technical explana tion. He replies: 'The Holy Spirit (πνεύμα άγων) shall come upon you (ελενσεται επί σε), and the power of the Highest (και δύναμις ΰφίστου) shall overshadow you (επισκιάσει(επισκιάσει σοι); therefore that holy thing which is born (διό και το γεννώμενονγεννώμενον άγων) shall be called a son of God (κληθήσεται vios θεού)'. Luke 1:35. Clearly the author of Luke-Acts, just like the Augustan poets, wishes to show how the figure at the centre of his Christian cult is divine by procreation, and in no analogical or allegorical sense. Our comparison of Mathaean and Lukan accounts of the Virgin Birth show that not every selection and development of Old Testament proof texts will yield the sense in which Luke uses his divine titles. Luke affirms the use of Old Testament concepts of σωτηρία σωτηρία in support of his title of σωτήρ because he can thereby construct a parallelism with the imperial ideology, just as he does when he interprets Old Testament prophecies of the Virgin Birth as a divine procreation. But it is not the case that the author has taken on the categories of the Imperial Cult without radical reinterpretation. It is not a pagan cultus with which we are presented but a transformed Old Testament theology in which Jesus' Messiahship stands realized. Luke is holding up to Theophilus and his circle inverse mirror images of their pagan culture in the sense that he reverses the categories and values of what those images reflect. It has often been pointed out that the language of Luke 1:35 almost self-consciously rules out any concept of divine action on Mary's womb understood in purely physical terms, as was the case with Anchises fathering by the seduction of Venus both Aeneas and thereby the gens Julia (Virgil Aeneid 1,617-20). The divine activity in the miraculous birth is described in highly abstract terms. The anthropomorphism of 'shall come upon you (ελενσεται(ελενσεται επί σε)' is all but obliterated by making the subject of this verb 'holy spirit (πνεύμα άγων)'. The equivalent expression in 37 For a further discussion and full bibliography, see J.

Yet as we have pointed out, there was no connection between the title son of God and divine progeny in the tradition which preceded Luke. His theology of the Virgin Birth is the result of the impress of the template of imperial ideology upon that material. Mark 15:39 places that title in the mouth of the centurion where the author uses it as a double-entendre: his readers knew what the title really meant, without any Lukan concession to a pagan theology of divine procreation. The author of Luke-Acts is therefore creating a metaphysical sense in which Jesus can be seen as a divine progeny in self-conscious, inverse reflection on the position of Augustus in the Imperial Cult. He refashions the concepts of that cult and the community at the centre of which it stood in order to present his own contra-cultural image that identifies his own counter group. We shall now examine a third strand in the Lukan hymns, and aetiological stories associated with it, in terms of the contra cultural response of the community of Luke-Acts to the Augustan concept of Victoria, its messianic associations, and its divinization from an abstract term into a person. Π,ι.3. 11,1-3■ Victoria and the Magnificat (Luke 1:46-35) We saw how Victoria in the republican cult was turned into one of the divine personalities of the Emperor, as witnessed in the inscriptions on the gemma Augustea where Roma appears alongside representations of Victoria, Oikumene, and Tellus. Thus Victoria and Salus were qualities achieved through the sacerdotal qualities of the figure of Augustus, with his augur's lituus, who was genus divorum,divorum, and stood there as presiding priest of a cult which sacramentally could secure the saeculum aureum. There is no necessary connection, in a logical sense, between the concepts of Victoria and Salus in battle, a golden age, a human figure of divine and supernatural parentage, and a series of sacred 38 V. Taylor, The Historical Evidence for the Virgin Birth (Oxford: Clarendon, 1920); R. E.

In terms of traditional, post Chalcedon, Christian theology, Mary's virginity and the manner of her con ception has significance for the theology of incarnation. But there is as a background to the original account in Luke none of the latter theological and philosophical concerns of Chalcedon. The Magnificat Magnificat does not have Mary meditating on and glorying in the two natures made one in what she conceives. What then is the origin of worship which combines a particular birth with martial power and a golden age? Mary interprets the significance of the genus dei, the 1ΰός τοΰ θεούθεού which she bears, in terms of a military victory. Her ταπείνωσις has been ended by God who is 6 δυνατός, and who has 'shown (εποίησεν) the might (κράτος) of his arm (kv βραχίονι αυτού)' and 'scattered the proud (διεσκόρπισεν ΰπερφάνους)' (Luke 1:48—51). 'He has cast down (καθεϊλεν) the mighty (δυνάστας) from their thrones (από θρόνων)' (v. 52). Furthermore, Zachariah's thanksgiv ing for the birth of John the Baptist sets the themes of σωτηρία, λύτρωσις,λύτρωσις, and άφέσις in the militaristic context of the κέρας σωτηρίας which gives deliverance εξ εχθρών (1:69-70, 74). The cultural and historical template which orders the theme of Victoria Victoria (νίκη) and makes intelligible their relationship with the events of a supernatural birth and a divine Child which ushers in a reign of pax or ειρήνη is that of the Imperial Cult. That cult, from 9 bc onwards, transfigured the landscape of religious archi tecture and culture in the Asia Minor of the provenance of the Lukan writings, as well as at Caesarea Philippi in Palestine itself.39 Some traditional, Jewish prophetic elements might contribute to that picture, such as the vision of the Golden Age, in Isa. 2:1-4, or 11:1—11 where nature is at peace, so that a young child can live among wild animals without danger. But the messianic child, who ushers in the saeculum aureum, is not born supernaturally. Elijah is mentioned in the latest recension of Malachi but there the scene is of judgement and purification, and not of peace and security. Luke 1:15—17 applies the description of Elijah (Mai. 4:4-5) to John, but without the addition of threatened judgement (μή(μή έλθω και πατάξω την γήν άρδην). The original description of the messenger is one of terror (Mai. 3:2-6). Thus Luke's description here of the future ministry of John the Baptist blends with the ε'ιρήνη of a Judaeo-Christian saeculum aureum without the themes 39 Caesarea Philippi is not given in Luke 9:18—20 as the location of Peter's confession of Jesus' Messiahship. Luke wishes to correct a seditious misreading of Mark 8:27-33. The pax Christi fulfils the pax Augusta rather than overthrowing it. See Brent Kinman, Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem in the Context of Lukan Theology and the Politics of His Day, AGJU 27 (Leiden: Brill, 199s), pp. 89-90.</page><page sequence="18">428 ALLEN BRENT of judgement associated with John elsewhere (Matt. 3:7-12; Mark 1:6-8). Luke 3:7-15 modifies the judgemental picture of John, even though he retains the 'wrath to come' (v. 7), by the addition of more peaceful features. John, shorn of Elijah's dress and diet, exhorts the giving of food and clothing to those in need. Tax collectors are not to exact more than their allotted amount. Roman soldiers are to be content with their wages (vv. 10-14). The Lukan Golden Age has no such elements of judgement, but has instead a supernaturally born divine child, and themes of Victoria and Pax.Pax. Indeed, judgement and purification would have been as alien to the background to Luke's own material in chapters 1-2 as the fasces fasces securesque would have been to the lictors pointedly depicted without them on Augustus' Ara Pacts.40 Thus the template which relates such disparate themes into a logically interrelated whole is that of the Imperial Cult, as a sacramental, augural act initiating and perpetuating the saeculum aureum. The 'judgement' which might be seen in Luke 1:52-53, where the mighty are thrown down and the humble exalted, has parallels in the Augustan social revolution. The beneficiaries in Mary's song of Σωτηρία and Λύτρωσις have their counterpart in the social revolution marked by the advent of the Imperial Cult and its celebration of Νική. Civic banquets, like civic games, were linked to cultic celebrations of imperial birthdays in the cultic lectionary that Fishwick posits and attempts to reconstruct.41 Part of the largesse required of the prestigious priests of the Imperial Cult was lavish civic banquets. A decree of the provincial council of Asia, a copy of which is preserved in an inscription from Hypaepa, records the choir of Asia holding a banquet after hymns and sacrifices in honour of Tiberius' birthday.42 In the games which proceeded such banquets, with the procession of imperial images from a Sebasteion to the games themselves, the rich would have places of honour around the presiding Governor, with the Emperor's chair occupied by his image if he was not there in person.43 The ranks and degrees of political authority thus united 40 G.

Augustus' revolution, if not exactly 'exalting the humble and meek', had certainly raised seats of honour for a social class that had not possessed them before, but which could rise socially through its benefactions to a new cult celebrating a political revolution. Thus it would not be correct simply to confine the phenomenon of the Imperial Cult in Asia Minor to 'the municipal and provincial aristocracies' who adminis tered it.45 The cult was a celebration of Augustus' new social order in which every rank and status was to play its part. Pax Pax and Victoria in the context of the Old Testament promises fulfilled in Christ, and Luke's version of the saeculum aureum, were not exact mirror images of the Imperial Cult. Rather they reflected the latter in the form of their preferred distortions of it. Christianity, seen as Judaism fulfilled, provided a solution for the hungry and meek who were satisfied with good things, with the rich sent away empty (Luke 1:52-53). The virgin's child, who is the sign in the saeculum aureum of λύτρωσις, ειρήνη and σωτηρία, is laid in a manger (Luke 2:7) as a symbol of the hungry and the oppressed. Thus Christianity as Judaism fulfilled changes the order of prestige in the new age. The eschatological banquet is to exalt to its positions of honour the ταπεινοί and the πεινώντες. So far we have examined Lukan parallels with the imperial ideology that are complicated by an Old Testament backcloth. That backcloth was of itself insufficient to have generated Luke's particular eschatology without the template of the imperial ideo logy. But we now pass on to a feature of Luke's account for which there is no Old Testament backcloth, but rather a direct relationship with the imperial ideology. Pliny (Panegyricus 54,1) makes it clear that a collective act of homage was succeeded by events in both theatre and amphitheatre in which the populace was heavily involved. 45 See also Fishwick (1987) 2,1, p. 585 quoted in Alfoldy (1996), p. 254. The latter symposium records a fundamental reassessment of the importance of the Imperial Cult on which I here rely, in opposition to the earlier position of A. N. Sherwin-White, 'The early persecutions and Roman Law again', JTSns 3,2 (1952), 210 with which at least in this respect agrees G. Ε. M. De Ste. Croix, 'Why were the early Christians persecuted?'

The one is clearly a kind of inverse mirror image of the other. Luke introduces his birth narrative with a chronological note linking Christ's birth with Augustan history in his story of the census (2:1-3).46 But we do well to ask whether this interaction with secular history is intended to be purely chronographic, or whether there is some further purpose reflected in the choice of at least some of these dates and figures. The only possible historical basis for this census is a local one under Cyrenius as governor of Syria.47 But why should this local census (αΰτη ή άπογράφη) be associated with some general world wide edict of Augustus (δόγμα ... άπογράφεσθαι πάσαν την οίκου!οίκου!οίκου!αένην)? The author of Luke—Acts clearly wishes to associate the birth of Jesus with Augustus, the mention of whose name in connection with the account of the birth of the true Messiah is evocative of many of the themes of the Imperial Cult.48 In Asia Minor in the proconsular decree of 9 bc Augustus' birthday was celebrated as the beginning of the saeculum aureum (ή του θειοτάτου Καίσαρος γΐνέθλίοςγΐνΐθλι,ος ημέρα ην τη των πάντων αρχή 'ίσην ...). In Res Gestae 8,2 Augustus lays great stress on the census that he took in 28 and 8 bc and in ad 14. As the word lustrum suggests, there was a religious dimension to such acts: it was not simply a pragmatic device required by a utilitarian theory of 'good govern ment'. The lustrum was properly the completion of the census, as 46 Other links with imperial history are of course 3:1: 'the fifteenth year of Tiberias Caesar', hence ad 30, with Pontius Pilate named as the 'pro-consul' (ηγεμονεύοντος) of Judaea, Herod as tetrarch of Galilee, Philip of Ituraea, and Lysanius of Abilene. The action of Claudius in expelling the Jews from Rome is recorded, in explanation of the presence of Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:2). Gallio is mentioned as 'pro-consul (ανθυπάτου) of Achaea' (18:12). We also meet with Porcius Festus, succeeding Felix as governor (ηγεμων) (Acts 23:25-27; 24:27). 47 We have inscriptions from the third century bc Achaia: SEG XL (1990) 394, 25, 27 (Dyme) and 400, 18 (Tritaia) which use απογραφέντα), απογραφέντες, and απογραψάντωναπογραψάντων in connection with criteria for citizenship and corresponding enrolment. 48 For Luke's use of secular chronography to such a parallel between Jesus' kingdom and that of Augustus, see C. Talbert, 'Literary Patterns, Theological Themes,Themes, and the Genre of Luke-Acts', SBLMS 20 (1974), pp. 44-45; R. E. Brown, The The Birth of the Messiah (Garden City NY: Doubleday, 1977), pp. 241-43. These reflections are also taken up by P. W. Walasky in his account of Luke—Acts as apologia apologia pro imperio to a Christian group, in \And so we came to Rome': The Political Perspective Perspective of St. Luke', SNTSMS 49 (1983), pp. 25—28.

The lustrum here refers to the 'purification' of the citizen body after its numbers had been determined (censu perfecto), and the capacity of each person in the rank now allotted them to contribute to the cost of the war against the Vei. The ceremony (suovetaurilia) was performed in the Campus Martius where a pig, sheep, and bull were sacrificed (Livy 1,44,2). Thus a lustrum of the city was performed as an apotropaic rite following prodigies in order to secure metaphysical pax that was to be the achievement of Augustus alone. Implicit in Livy is the notion that such prodigies became increasingly more frequent as the political breakdown of the Republic was reflected in the increasingly chaotic supernatural order.49 Arruns moreover required the purification of the city limits, its sacred boundary the pomerium, but to no avail when he saw what the haruspicia indicated (Lucan Pharsalia 593-95). We should not therefore secularize the process of the census and cut it off from its religious roots so as to make a lustrum after a portent quite different from a lustrum after a census.50 The roots of both are in the apotropaeic function of the cult, as the suovetaur ilia ilia clearly indicated.51 The reformed cult in which Augustus as PontifexPontifex Maximus achieved the pax deorum, now almost equivalent to the saeculum aureum, requires a census the significance of which Augustus would have seen in such a perspective. We can now see why the author of Luke-Acts wished to give a local census of Quirinus such a universal, world-wide perspective, quite apart from the added, migratory feature which could bring ordinary residents of Nazareth to Bethlehem. He wished to parallel the birth of Jesus with that of Augustus not simply as Emperor but as founder of the Imperial Cult, and thus to compare the religious claims made by the latter with his claims for the former. We can see too how he presupposes, as his work proceeds, an eschatology closer to the pre-occupations of the development of the vision of Virgil Ecolgues 4, and the role that it came to play in the Imperial Cult, than to traditional Christian eschatology. 49 Livy 39,22,4-5; 42,20; Julius Obsequens 13; 44; 46; 49; 52; 63. 50 This point is well made by Berve, Lustrum, in PWK 13,1-2 cols 2040—2059, see e.g. 2041: 4Man wird durchaus an eine 'sakral-profane' Einheit als Wurzel zu denken haben, die auch der realistische Charakter der romischen Religion und die Heiligkeit des Staatsrechtes geradezu fordert ...'. 51 Ibid. col. 2043-2046.</page><page sequence="22">432 ALLEN BRENT III.III. SAECULUM AUREUM: THE MINISTRY OF JESUS AND THE PAX DEI In the specifically Lucan account of the rejection at Nazareth (Luke 4:16-30), Jesus, who has already appeared at the centre of the old temple cult astonishing the teachers of that cult with his understanding of the Law (Luke 2:46-48), announces (4:19) in the synagogue the 'year of the Lord's favour (ενιαυτόν κυρίου δεκτόν)'. Thus the Lukan saeculum aureum, begun with the Divine Child, is now continued by the grown man. Using the words of Isa. 61:1—2 combined with 58:6, he is able to define the Ινιαυτόν κυρίου κυρίου δεκτόν as one in which there would be 'preaching the good news to the poor (ευαγγελίσασθαι πτωχοί 9), ... proclaiming release to the prisoners (κηρύξαι αϊχμαλώτοις αφεσιν) and seeing-again to the blind (και τυφλοϊς ανάβλεφιν), ... to set at liberty those who are oppressed (αποστεΐλαι τεθραυσμένους εν αφέσει)'. That we are dealing with Lukan special material here enables us to forge links with the eschatology of Luke 1-2, and hence with the eschatology also of the Imperial Cult and its saeculum aureum.aureum. The Koinon of Asia, on the motion of the high-priest Apollonius son of Menophilos the Aizanian, had claimed that Πρόνοια Πρόνοια 'had granted them and their successors a saviour (τοΐ? μεθ'μεθ' ■ημάς σωτήρα χαρισάμενη)' in Augustus 'who had made war to cease (τον παύσαντα μεν πόλεμον) and had adorned peace (κοσμήσ αντααντα δε είρήνην)'. These sentiments were reflected in Luke I:7L77&gt;79; 2:11,14,29. But the decree of the Koinon had also stated that 'Caesar, on his appearance (επιφανείς δε) had exceeded the hopes of all those who had received glad tidings before us ... (τάς ελπίδας τών προλαβόντων [ευαγγέλια πάντων όπερ] έθηκεν)' Φ2 The restoration of the text can be justified with reference to at least two further inscriptions, one from the Peloponnese referring to a priest sacrificing (θύσαντα) in view of 'good news (εύανγέ\λια])', concerning the imperial family (υπέρ οίκου παντός τ[ώ] Σεβα [στα&gt;]), and another from Samos in the time of Augustus referring to a festival (ήμέραν εύα[νγέλιον]) celebrating good news from Rome.53 When the good news of the granting of an Imperial Cult is brought to a city such as Sardis, the city is described as 'evangel ized'.54 When Luke says εϋαγγελίσασθαι πτωχοϊς in the context of his inversion of the images of imperial eschatology, we may thus 52 Ehrenberg and Jones (1955) 98 (b) 1. 35-39. 53 Both are cited in G. Horsley, New Documents Illustrating Early Christianity (Macquarie, Ancient History Documentation Research Centre, 1983) III, p. 13. The Peloponnese inscription is reconstructed in L.

The ευαγγέλια are not for the benefit of the new wealthy leaders of the city states of Asia Minor or of Syria, who were the rising beneficiaries of the Augustan revolution, however, but for the poor. Paradoxically priesthoods of the Imperial Cult itself had been an important vehicle for the upwardly socially mobile liberti, who by pursuing priesthoods with their new-found wealth could also find their new rank celebrated in the προεδρίαι at events in the theatres and amphitheatres which were part of the celebrations of the Imperial Cult.55 Such is the εϋαγγελιον of the Christian Luke, whose theme of ε'ιρήνη,ε'ιρήνη, established in the Infancy stories, is now continued. Judaism itself cannot secure the pax dei, and cannot achieve the eschatological order in nature and in society for which those who sought the pax deorum through the Imperial Cult aspired. Ε'ιρήνη is characteristically used by Luke, often in reformulation of his traditional material, in connection with the stability of the political as well as the natural world. In addition to Luke 1:79; 2:14,29, already discussed, we have some parallels with the few references in other gospels,56 but some significant additions of the author's own. In parabolic additions in Luke 11:21 the armed strong man's possessions are consequently εν ε'ιρήνη. In 14:32 the king sends an embassy and έρωτα τά ■προς είρήνην. The latter phrase is then used in 19:42 in order to describe why Judaism had failed. 'Jesus drew near to the city [Jerusalem] and wept over her (εκλαυσεν 177■' αυτήν), saying: 'Would that even you had known in this day (εί εγνως kv τήτή ήμερα ταύτη και σύ) the things that make for peace (τά προς εΙρήνηεΙρήνηεΙρήνην)'.ε'ιρήνην)'. The immediately preceding context makes it clear that this phrase refers to the specifically Lucan εΙρήνη announced by the angels to the shepherds and proclaimed by Symeon as the counterpart to Augustus' saeculum aureurn that had achieved the pax pax deorum through the Divine Child of Virgil's shepherds (Eclog. 4). Jesus weeps this lament only after we have read Luke's refash ioned words of the crowd of disciples (πλήθος των μαθητών) at the Triumphal Entry. Their proclamation directly parallels what the 55 P. Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (trans. A. Shapiro; Ann Arbor: U. of Michigan, 1990), pp. 129—31, 319-28. 56 Ειρήνη occurs once only in Mark 5:34 ( = Luke 7:50; 8:48), and four times in John 14:27, 16:33, and 20:19,21,26 ( = Luke 24,36). In all of these instances, the reference is to the psychological calm produced through Jesus' spiritual presence. In Matt. 10:13 it is used in the sense of righteous indignation which can be given or withheld to the advantage or disadvantage of those who receive the mission of the Twelve. Only in Matt. 10:34 ( = Luke 12:51) is it used in the sense of social disturbance.</page><page sequence="24">434 ALLEN BRENT angels' song at Bethlehem had promised (Luke 19:37-38). In verse 38 we read: 'Blessed is the king (βασιλεύς) who comes in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven (εν ουρανώ ειρήνη) and glory in the highest (και δόξα εν ΰφίστοις)'. Ειρήνη Ειρήνη εν ουρανό) thus parallels the ειρήνη επί γης of Luke 2:14·57 In none of the other Gospel parallels is the insertion into the pilgrim Ps. 118 that of an unqualified βασιλεύς. Indeed, Matt. 21:9 reads in its place τω υιώ Δαυίδ, and Mark 11:10 speaks of a kingdom but no king (ή ερχόμενη βασιλεία του πατρός ημών Δαυίδ).5* Only John 12:13 approaches the Lucan usage with the qualified 6 βασι λεύςλεύς τοΰ Ισραήλ. Luke's monarch has no nationality, but he stands like the Divine Child of Luke 1-2 in the centre of his people, bringing the pax dei, just as the figure of Augustus had stood on the Ara Pads bringing the saeculum aureum or on the Gemma securing with his augur's wand the pax deorum. In his description of the Last Supper, following the Triumphal Entry, Luke introduces the theme of the authority structure of the new community that Jesus is creating through his death. IV. THE LAST SUPPER AS INAUGURATION OF THE APOSTOLIC COMMUNITY The Twelve are entrusted (Luke 22:28-30) with the kingdom and promised thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel in words found in a different context in Matt. 19:28. In the latter case, the promise to sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes is not associated with the βασιλεία but the παλιγγενεσία, and there is no reference to the messianic banquet. Luke thus wishes to associate these words with the order and organization of the reformed community, and with its central meal. He has already modified the Synoptic tradition with the addition of ό βασιλεύς to ό ερχόμενος (Luke 19:38 cf. Mark 11:9; Matt. 21:9). Now we have introduced the corresponding βασιλεία. But this gospel suggests in turn a reflection on the sacrificial gathering at the Imperial Cult, with its celebration of the social hierarchy of the imperial city state, and the Christian saeculum aureum foreshadowed in chapters 1-2, in which the hungry would be fed and the rich sent away empty. 57 For Luke's emphasis on the 'royal' character of the Triumphal Entry against its Graeco-Roman background, see Kinman (1995) chapters 3 and 6. 58 Walaskay rightly criticises Conzelmann's characterization of the Lucan altera tions as non-political, in order to favour his interpretation of Luke-Acts as apologia pro pro ecclesia ad imperium. Cf. Conzelmann (1961), p. 139; Walaskay (1983), p. 9. For other examples inconsistent with a political apology before a Roman magis trate, see Luke 6:15 and Acts 1:13; Luke 22:35—38; 19,38 and Acts 1:6, all discussed in Walaskay (1983) pp. 16-18.</page><page sequence="25">LUKE-ACTS AND THE IMPERIAL CULT 435 Whether one accepts the textual tradition which omits Luke 22:22:19b—20 or that which retains it, there remains nevertheless a foretaste of the eschatological banquet. The breaking of bread by the community of the Twelve (Acts 2:46) partially fulfils that eschatology. Immediately before the promise of the twelve thrones to the Twelve, the dispute about greatness occurs (Luke 22:24-27). Here once again there is a significant recasting by the author in pursu ance of his special theme. The parallel passages in Matt. 20:20-28 and Mark 10:35—45 are addressed in the former case to the request of the mother of the sons of Zebedee, and in the latter to James and John themselves. In Luke 22:24 the dispute is a general one about 'which of them should be greatest'. Thus the specific request in Matthew and Mark for a position in an assumed hierarchical authority structure for two individuals (Matt. 20:23; Mark 10:40 = ουςους ητούμασταυ) is transformed by Luke into a general question of the structure of authority in the community itself. The άρχοντες τών εθνών and the μεγάλου are described in Matt. 20:25 and Mark 10:42 in identical terms. But in Luke 22:25 they have become oi βασιλείς των εθνών—diplomatically to Theophilus since the Emperor is not to be singled out—and, readapting their κατεζουσυάζουσυνκατεζουσυάζουσυν to εξουσυάζοντες, Luke is able then to add ευεργέτου καλοϋνταυ.59καλοϋνταυ.59 Ευεργέτης was the characteristic term for the bene factor of a Greek city-state in Asia Minor, and the term was particularly used of someone who endowed a temple and cult to the Emperor. Once again we see in the Christian community reverse reflections of the social structure and order represented in the seating for the banquet ensuing from cultic sacrifice. It is in such a context that Luke chooses to locate the reversal of role values, in which the greater in age (ό μείζων) must become as the younger (ό νεώτερος) and the (consular) ruler (ό ηγούμενος) as the one who serves at table (ό δυακονών) (Luke 22:26-27). The reformed worship thus inaugurated was to continue in Acts under the direction of the Apostles, who proved a focus of unity. Their number, twelve, may reflect the twelve tribes of Israel, but the need to replace a lost member, as Matthias replaces Judas, reflects similar arrangements for the college of the Fratres Arvales whose Acta are an important source for how the Imperial Cult was observed at Rome. The college was an important part of Augustus' reformation of Roman Religion. Furthermore their ceremonial arrangements, like the Calendar of festivals of the 59 Walaskay (1983) p. 36 regards the removal of κατά from the Marcan κατακυρ tevaiv and κατβξουσιάζουσιν as a modification of the severity of these expressions.</page><page sequence="26">436 ALLEN BRENT Imperial Cult, clearly influenced celebrations in the provinces where they were known.60 As a college, they were always, like the apostles, twelve in number. Augustus joined their number (Res Gestae Gestae 4,7) in accordance with the legend and in accordance also with his claim to be the new Romulus presiding over the second founding of Rome.61 The Fratres Arvales became closely connected with the imperial cult, offering vota for the imperial household, and making sacri flees on imperial birthdays, and on the occasion of accessions to the throne. Any vacancy in the number of twelve was filled by the college itself, just like the twelve apostles, though in the latter case we should note the incongruity of the replacement of Judas with the failure to replace James (Acts 1:24-26 cf. 12:1-5) as evidence of Luke's own construction. In CIL VI, 2080 line 22 ff. we find recorded the election of Publius Manlius Carbo 'in the place of Q. Bittius Proculus' in consequence of the Emperor Hadrian's letter casting his vote for his collega. Thus we find a parallel to Matthias, chosen λαβείν τον τόπον της διακονία? ταύτης και και αποστολής (Acts 1:25)■ The parallel is, I submit, not accidental in the light of imperial ideology which I have established to be the context of the theology of Luke-Acts. The Twelve, as the foundation of the New Israel, are accompan ied by those who 'continued with one accord (προσκαρτεροΰντες ομοθυμαδόν)ομοθυμαδόν) in the temple (εν τω Ιερω), breaking bread at home ...' (Acts 2:46). The eating together points back to the Last Supper where their seats of authority in the community had been assigned to them. Yet this takes place in the community of equals hailed by Mary (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-37 cf· Luke 1:52-53) in contrast to the dynasts of the city states of Asia Minor whose imperial sacrifi cial banquets celebrated rank and power. Finally Paul, claiming to be the representative of the true Israel, (Acts 26:5-7) defends himself against an imperfect Judaism that is the source of θόρυβος and στάαις (Acts 24:1-15 cf. 18:4-17; 19:21-40) in continuance of its ignorance of 'the things that make for peace (τά προς είρήνην)' (Luke 19:42)· The discrete message remains the same, namely that what the leaders of the Old Israel, 60 See Fishwick (1987) 2, 1, p. 482-85 and PWK (1899), Bd. 2, col. 1471: man sieht deutlich, dass dem Kaiser Augustus bei seiner Reorganisation des Collegiums die Wiederbelebung des halbsvergessenen Dienstes der dea Dea nur ein Mittel zum Zwecke, und die sacrale Verherrlichung des Kaiserhauses durch die mit besonderem Ansehen bekleidete Priesterschaft die Hauptache war'. 61 Macrobius, Sat.

V. IN CONCLUSION Theophilus and his circle were not in a relationship of open conflict with the Imperial Cult, as was the writer of the Apocalypse. Standing at the forefront of the successors to the Greek city states in communities such as Ephesus, Pergamon, Antioch in Pisidia, etc., they well knew that there was as yet no legal compulsion on them to participate in the Imperial Cult. Before Decius Trajan (ad 251) such participation was voluntary but social pressure, as Tertullian's later De Corona was to indicate, could have the same practical conclusions of drawing hostile atten tion to non-participants and the drawing up of charges of scelera or of contumacia against them.62 Yet the Graeco—Roman religious culture that had formed their perspectives on the world was one to which that cult was critical. The Augustan revolution had produced the pax deorum, and reor dered the cosmic and metaphysical dislocation of the natural order witnessed in a century of civil wars with which countless prodigi ous natural disasters were associated. There was a strongly felt moral and patriotic compulsion to continue what had been celeb rated in the decrees of the Koinon of Asia and elsewhere. But they had been catechetized and received into the post-Pauline communities in Asia Minor, and were now Christians. How could their new faith enable their reintegration into the community from which it had alienated them? How could this perceived, social-psychological need for the celebration of social order after bloody social strife, fulfilled in the Imperial Cult that had secured the pax deorum, now experience new fulfilment in the new religion? The way the writer chose was to deconstruct early Christian eschatology so as to recast significantly traditional themes of judgement, and then to assimilate Christian eschatology to that of Augustus' saeculum aureum. Thus we have answered the first question with which we began. In answer to the second question we have seen that the saeculum aureum was initiated through an act of augury, Augustus' special 62 Sherwin White (1952) 210-11 cf. De Ste Croix (1963) 18-21 and Sherwin White (1964) 24-26.</page><page sequence="28">438 ALLEN BRENT auguriumaugurium pacts which had succeeding in achieving the pax deorum where republican religion had failed. The answer to the second question was to be found in the Christian counterpart to the Imperial Cult, which could alone achieve the refashioned Christian saeculum aureum. The author now had to identify the religion into which Theophilus has been catechetized as a reformed Jewish cult. He was thus prepared to deconstruct Paul's radical disjunction between the Law and Christ (Gal. 3:10—14), even in the softened form of Rom. 9—11.63 Luke now offers a positive reason for non-participation, namely that the purpose of the Imperial Cult—the pax deorum and the sacramental means for the continuance of the saeculum aureum—is far better achieved through the ειρήνη of Bethlehem, the triumphal entry, and the νικήνική and σωτηρία that follow from the birth of the child from the virgin, and from his death and resurrection. Theophilus can thus know 'the security (την άσφάλειαν) regarding the discourses of his catechesis (περί ών κατηχήθης λόγων)' (Luke 1:4)· Such an ideology opened the prospect for Theophilus and his group to overcome their alienation from their cultural heritage and to reintegrate themselves into the social fabric of their societies by means of a new religion that would achieve the perceived objective of those societies. But as an ideology for integrating Christianity into the imperial ideal it was to prove abortive at this point in time, though later to be partially realized in that of Eusebius and Prudentius.64 Allen Brent 63 R.
