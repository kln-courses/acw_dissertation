Greenblattj RCA-AE Division, Princeton, New Jersey PAGES 432a and 434a of the December 1965 issue of the American Scientist de scribe certain stone "round things" (I cannot call them circles), which have been found at several places in the British Isles. It is said, on page 434a of that magazine, that these misshapen round things may have been the result of a prehistoric British attempt to make the value of pi equal to 3. The existence of that descrip tion and the immediately preceding article, "Legal Value of Pi," bring to mind the fantasy of the "Pi-Three-ers" and the "Pi-Four-ers." In 1897, at which time the people of the United States were already displaying their abilities in the various sciences, a bill was introduced in the legislature of the state of Indiana to set the value of pi, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, equal to a simple, easily managed, fraction. The bill was not writ ten by a madman, or a lunatic, or an or ganization of foreign spies. The bill was written by a country medical doctor who fancied himself somewhat of a mathe matician. He must have thought, as do so many other poorly informed people, that the circle is such a common, ordinary, everyday thing that the ratio of its cir cumference to its diameter could not really be a long, complicated number?surely, not an infinitely long number. So the bill was written, suggesting several different simple (but incorrect) relationships be tween the area of a circle, the circumfer ence of that circle, the diagonal of a square, and so on. The bill is a curious collection of inept, and untrue, mathe matical statements. The bill was presum ably offered as a contribution to education in the state of Indiana. Kasner and Newman (see the reference) have stated that some anthropomorphic soul ventured the opinion that a universe in which pi did not exist would be incon ceivable. This opinion, they state, is a little on the harsh side. It is hard to im agine that the sun would fail to rise just because an accurate value of pi did not exist. But the adventures of the people who lived on the imaginary island of S.diPUTS tend to indicate that more than one group of people on this earth have tried to modify this natural number. This island, which was inhabited by people from the United States, is partly from the Big Yockley chain. The residents formed rather naturally into two groups. Both groups agreed that it was only proper and fitting (and even required of a munificent government) that a legislature should legislate the value of pi. But they didn't agree on what value it should have. Those from the southern part of the is land, which was called "Pi-Three-Land," felt that pi should be fixed at an integer that was as close as possible to the "actual" value. While those in the north, the Pi-Four-ers, felt that there was certain Historically speaking? 223</page><page sequence="2">advantage to having the value of pi be a square number, and they chose the number 4. Both the northern and southern parts of the island had a fairly thriving econ omy, but great difficulties arose when there was trade between them. They were both at the stage of development where the only rational solution to the difficul ties they had in deciding on the "true" value of pi was war I In the northern part, where pi was equal to 4, all "circles" had a bit more length than was actually required to go around once. A sloppy solution would have been simply to let the excess mate rial overlap. But the artisans discovered that by making the circles have scalloped edges (as is shown in Fig. 1) they could take care of the extra length. And, in fact, the cross-sectional area of a drinking glass, a straw, a doughnut, and, in fact anything that was "circular," was scal loped in exactly this way so that the perimeter turned out to be precisely 4 times the average radius. This was quite acceptable in many cases. Most things seemed to have an artistic curve to them. But the automobile tires that they made were very bad indeed. Therein lies the secret reason the northern half of the island was eventually overrun by the people from the southern half. Figure 1 The people in the southern half, who had chosen pi equal to 3, were in some what better position. Their "round things" did not have enough perimeter to meet at the ends. A pie, for example, always ap peared to have a sector cut out of it. (Fig. 2 shows what a "round thing" in Pi-Three-Land would have looked like.) Figure 2 A drinking glass, horrors! All "round things" had a slit-like gap running up the side. But they quickly discovered a way to get around this difficulty. If you made two of everything, and arranged them so that the solid part of one occurred where the empty part of the other occurred, and then fused these two things together, then you got a perfectly usable device. But you had to use two instead of one. In the case of tires, for example, their solu tion worked very well. They put two tires at each axle, and arranged them so that the solid part of one took over when the gapped part of the other was present. AS WE mentioned previously, these two groups declared war on each other in order to settle on the value of pi. The Pi-Three-ers had the tremendous advan tage that, with the use of two tires at each axle, they were able to ride in relative smoothness. For example, the equivalent of a jeep over there could easily go at 30 to 40 mph over open ground. But the people from the north, the Pi-Four-ers, had much greater difficulty. They had to build washboard-type roads, and if the periodic length of the washboard and of the bumps on the tire were the same then it was possible to get a fairly smooth ride in the country of Pi-Four. And just think 224 The Mathematics Teacher | March 1969</page><page sequence="3">of the traction that they were able to get between tire and road! But this assumes that the periodic length of the two curves was exactly the same. If the periodic lengths were different, then one got a very peculiar form of up and down motion if there was no slipping between tire and road. Actually, there was slipping, after the tires got worn down a bit, and tires would deteriorate very rapidly indeed after the initial period. The Pi-Four-ers had no difficulty at all in supplying a rifling groove down each of their artillery pieces and guns. In fact, they would have a multiplicity of rifling grooves. The Pi-Three-ers, on the other hand, although they had great mobility and could move around quickly, had great financial difficulty because they had to make and use two of everything that was needed. Eventually, storied history tells us, both halves of the island of S.diPUTS disappeared, and their final fate is un known. But from the fact that the ancient Britons, and the legislature of Indiana, and these imaginary inhabitants of S.diPUTS were so monumentally unsuc cessful in regulating the value of pi, one begins to think that perhaps the mathe maticians are right. Perhaps pi is an infinitely long irrational number. REFERENCE Kasner, Edward, and Newman, James R. Mathematics and the Imagination.
