<plain_text><page sequence="1">Other Than Counting Words: A Linguistic Approach to Content Analysis* CARL W. ROBERTS, Iowa State University Abstract A linguistic technique for the content analysis of texts and transcripts is described and illustrated. The technique produces a quantitative description of texts that represents both the interrelations among words and their classification into mean- ing categories. The face validity of the description is demonstrated with a com- puter-aided "translation" of coded data back into text. The advantages of linguis- tic content analysis over qualitative and computer-aided approaches to content analysis are discussed. Also discussed are problems of linguistic ambiguity and of the computer automation of the technique. While Director of the Experimental Division for the Study of War-Time Communications, Harold Lasswell explained that in the content analysis of texts, "We do no more than describe what is said according to the usual meaning of language to those who use it and by whom it is assumed the statement is read" (1941, p. 4). Although this depiction may have seemed straightforward at first, it soon became clear that the descriptions ren- dered in content analyses are of two kinds-each with its own method- ological shortcoming. In qualitative content analyses, the assignment of codes to content depends on the coder's subjective impressions of the latent contextual meanings of words. If sufficient inter-coder agreement cannot be demonstrated, the replicability of the findings from such analy- ses may be called into question. Computers currently afford quantitative content analysts the ability to obtain perfect inter-coder (actually inter- computer) agreement on frequencies of manifest content (i.e., of specific words or phrases) in texts. However when computer-aided content analy- *This research was supported in part by a grant from the Iowa State University Achievement Foundation.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, content analysts debated whether their technique was appropriate to both manifest (or "objective") and la- tent (or "impressionistic") content. A consensus reached in the late 1960s (Holsti 1969) was that content analysis is appropriate to both types of data. However, current content analysis methodologies remain troubled by the underlying methodological problems that were revealed by the debate. The increasing application of computers to textual data has occasionally resulted in an overreliance on manifest content (see critiques by Ogilvie, Stone &amp; Kelly 1982; Woodrum 1984). On the other hand, some impres- sionistic (or qualitative) studies using content analysis have been justly criticized for "gleaning" impressions from a mass of documentation with- out serious specification of the methods of coding" (Markoff, Shapiro &amp; Weitman 1974, p. 25). In deference to such criticisms, the hallmark of modem content analysis methodology has become the maintenance of a balance between the objective and implied aspects of textual data. This paper presents a linguistic content analysis technique that treats the clause as the unit of analysis. It is more objective than qualita- tive content analysis, because coders' subjective impressions are grounded in each clause and are thus not likely to deviate too far from authors' intentions. It is more powerful than computer-aided content analysis, be- cause coders record relations among words and thus words' linguistic contexts are less likely to be ignored. The technique also affords commu- nications research the ability to address questions regarding the syntactic import of language in social action. Before describing linguistic content analysis, overviews are given of the strategies currently employed in qualitative and computer-aided content analysis to meet the methodologi- cal problems mentioned above. Due to numerous advances in computer- aided content analysis in the past two decades, the latter overview will be much lengthier than the first. Qualitative Content Analysis Qualitative content analysis techniques (Holsti 1969; Krippendorff 1980) generally require that coders make impressionistic judgments about the phenomena under investigation. Objectivity is maintained through rigor- ous sampling and training/supervising of coders. As a result, such analy- ses are invariably time-consuming and often expensive. For example, in The Prestige Press (Pool 1955) a large Carnegie Corporation grant was needed to finance the coding of "political symbolism" within 19,553 news- paper editorials. In his introduction to the 1955 edition, Pool accurately predicts, "It is unlikely that anyone will again do the kind of voluminous</page><page sequence="3">Linguistic Content Analysis / 149 content analysis represented by the RADIR project except by computer" (p. xvii). Computer-Aided Content Analysis Since Stone and his colleagues' (1966) popularization of the General In- quirer content analysis program, computer-aided content analysis of texts and transcripts has gained greater and more innovative use. As with non- computer-aided techniques, the first stage in computer-aided content anal- ysis involves the selection of meaning categories into which words are to be classified.' Although one may develop one's own scheme of meaning categories (usually referred to as a dictionary), one may use general pur- pose dictionaries developed by others. The Lasswell Value Dictionary and the Harvard IV Psychosocial Dictionary have had extensive use and cur- rently provide some standard for comparisons across studies. The newest version of the General Inquirer is equipped with a sophisticated disam- biguation dictionary that distinguishes among word uses as well as among words (Kelly &amp; Stone 1975). Dictionaries are available in English, Dutch, German, Italian, and other languages, as well as with special-purpose vo- cabularies (e.g., for the analysis of Medieval German epics).2 The marriage of dictionaries with content analysis software thus provides a fast and convenient means of counting manifest expressions of words that fall into the meaning categories set out in one's dictionary. As dictionaries are applied to texts in computer-aided content analy- ses a data matrix is produced that typically consists of frequencies of meanings (i.e., words within meaning categories) within sampling units. These sampling units may be paragraphs, editorials, transcripts, or other units of text. (Sampling units are rarely smaller than paragraphs, since text continuity is often lost as a result.)3 When high frequencies of two or more meanings often occur within the same sampling unit, the meanings are said to co-occur. Since these frequencies are interval-level measures, statistical techniques appropriate to continuous data may be applied to the data matrix of counts generated by one's software. The second stage in any content analysis involves the application of statistical techniques to the coded data. Although these techniques may include cross-tabular presentations such as those characteristic of The Pres- tige Press, they often involve analyses of word-occurrences in which factor and cluster analyses may be performed (Iker &amp; Klein 1974; McKinnon 1977; McTavish &amp; Pirro forthcoming). Techniques such as analysis of vari- ance (Potter 1982), structural equation models (Weber 1985), and the fitting of sine curves to historical fluctuations (Namenwirth 1973) have also been used. Occasionally, statistical analyses are restricted to those that accom- pany the content analysis software in use.</page><page sequence="4">150 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 Statistical analyses usually incorporate data from different social contexts, allowing one to evaluate whether meanings co-occur more with- in one context than another. Texts are often sampled from different news- papers, at different points in time, within different institutions, among different social groups, etc. The Minnesota Contextual Content Analysis (MCCA) program provides the user with four sets of "anchor points" that allow the user to compare frequencies of meanings expressed within the current social context to frequencies previously found in other contexts (McTavish &amp; Pirro forthcoming). Deviations from these anchor points may be used to identify peculiarities in the data at hand. The above-mentioned statistical techniques and the use of contex- tual comparisons are not unique to content analysis, however. Sophisti- cated multivariate analyses and research designs are commonplace among all contemporary social research. What is unique to content analysis is the first step mentioned above, namely the development of a data matrix from texts or transcripts. But when traditional computer-aided content analysis techniques are used to generate this matrix, statistical analyses may be misleading. If in a matrix of counts frequencies within two or more meaning categories are found to covary across sampling units, care must be taken not to make conclusions that are fallacious for ecological reasons. To illus- trate, consider a content analysis of the 1927 and 1933 prefaces to the Nazi party platform, in which one preface serves as a point of comparison for the other. These prefaces are short enough to be presented in their en- tirety, yet will prove long enough for some later rudimentary statistical analysis. (The original German texts are given in Appendix A. An English translation of these prefaces can be found in the left colunn of Table 2.) Let us begin with the hypothesis that once Nazi leaders gained control of the German government in January of 1933, their ideas shifted from utopian to ideological in nature. According to Mannheim, utopian ideals differ from ideological ones in that the former are "incongruous with the state of reality" toward which they are directed ([1929] 1969, p. 192). Since their explicit objectives prior to 1933 were to disassemble the fledgling Weimar democracy, the Nazis' 1927 ideals might best be de- scribed as utopian. Once in power, their objectives may have been por- trayed as more congruent with the new political state of reality, and thus as more ideological. A traditional computer-aided evaluation of this argument might (in part) involve counting intrasentential co-occurrences of the meaning cate- gories, "official literature" and "give,,4 under the assumption that the co- occurrences depict official Nazi literature as giving strategic information or advice that is in the reader's interest for advancing the (utopian) political aims of the Nazi party. Accordingly, the above hypotheses implies that co- occurrences of "official literature" and "give' would occur more often</page><page sequence="5">Linguistic Content Analysis / 151 within sentences (the sampling unit) in the 1927 than in the 1933 preface (the context). (Conversely, one might expect co-occurrences of "official literature" and "accomplish" to be more prevalent in the 1933 than in the 1927 preface. Here the argument would be that by depicting the objectives of official Nazi literature as accomplished, one conveys an ideological mes- sage that further social change is unnecessary.) However, as can be seen in the sentence, "Adolf Hitler has given me the task of editing the periodi- cals," a co-occurrence of "official literature" and "give" may not locate a statement that describes what the official literature gives, but that the literature (or a task related to it) is given. That is, mere location of co- occurrences ignores the syntactic relations among the words that co-occur. Content analysts are acutely aware of the dangers of generalizing from co-occurrences of words to assertions of relations among words exist- ing within specific sentences. Thus, the crucial final step in any computer- aided content analysis is "returning to the original text to find examples of the hypothesized themes" (Weber 1985, p. 71). KWIC (Key Word In Con- text) programs allow the researcher to readily verify that interpretations are valid. KWIC provides a listing of token words from meaning categories flanked by the words that immediately precede and follow them in the original text. In illustration, if one were to search the Nazi party prefaces for each instance of the meaning category, "give," that co-occurs in a sen- tence with an instance of the meaning category, "official literature," a KWIC program would output four lines such as those listed in Table 1. By centering the key word, "give," within its context, KWIC readily exposes three of the four co-occurrences of "official literature" and "give" as not being token expressions of the "official Nazi literature's giving something in the utopian interests of the reader" that is of theoretical concern. As discussed above, the third line of KWIC output makes clear that it is Hitler and not the literature of the Nazi party that gives. Since this co-occurrence does not fit its theoretical interpretation, it should not be considered as an instance of the type of co-occurrence of interest. The second line of KWIC output contains sufficient context to de- termine that the referent of the "they" that "gives a short glance" has official Nazi literature (viz., "prefaces") as its referent. However, although "a short glance back over the movement's struggle" may be depicted as interesting for the reader, it is not clear that this glance provides the reader with utopia-directed political information or advice, and (like the co-occurrence listed in the third line of KWIC output) it might not be regarded by the content analyst as a co-occurrence of theoretical interest. In contrast, the "official literature's" giving of a "uniform and complete picture of National Socialism" from the first line of KWIC output is later depicted as politically informative (i.e., "relate(d) to the various tasks of our public life") and may be the only one of the four co-occurrences that is consistent with the theoretical interpretation being applied to it.</page><page sequence="6">152 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 00 0 0~~~~~0 ja F. 8 0 0 t ,], O 0 l=If I LOI.C</page><page sequence="7">Linguistic Content Analysis / 153 Finally, the clause captured in the fourth line of KWIC output is expressed in passive voice, leaving it unclear whether the author, official Nazi literature, or someone or something else "should not give the im- pression" that the demands of this literature are not being pursued. Since the active subject is not explicit, it is impossible to determine from the text whether the co-occurrence is consistent with its theoretical interpretation. Yet even if it was the coder's judgment that official literature was the im- plied active subject of the sentence, the instances of "official literature" and "give" that co-occur in this sentence are not related in the manner theorized. That is, the sentence does not state that "the official literature gives something," but that "something should give an impression about the pursuit of the official literature's demands." This is not a trivial distinc- tion, since the latter relation has an ideological flavor (because you have been given the impression that the demands of the literature are being pursued, you need not be concerned with your fate), whereas the former is more utopian (the literature gives you the means to determine your fate). Thus, by returning to the original text, one can identify unforeseen grammatical constructions, semantic ambiguities, idiomatic uses of co-oc- curring words, etc., enabling one to drop co-occurrences from consider- ation when they are not related in a manner consistent with one's inter- pretation. It must be emphasized that relations among meaning categories are not indicated in the matrix of frequencies generated by conventional computer-aided content analysis programs such as the General Inquirer, MCCA, TEXTPACK, WORDS, etc. By themselves, frequencies provide an accurate rendering of the issues (or themes) that are salient within texts, but not of the relations of actors to the issues or of the issues to each other. The final return to the text is needed to evaluate the relations that word counts can not reveal. The argument here is not that a researcher should never return to the data once they have been coded. Often outliers result in misleading findings unless they are identified and removed from one's analysis. But the return to data required in traditional computer-aided content analysis is fundamentally different from this. Here the return to the data is a search for relations among variables that are the very substance of the hypothe- ses being tested. This shortcoming results because data comprised entirely of counts within meaning categories do not afford the researcher a means of directly testing relations among the words being counted. Consider Durkheim's finding that a larger proportion of suicides occurred within predominantly Protestant than Catholic European prov- inces. This finding suggests, but does not demonstrate a direct relation between Protestantism and suicide. Realizing this, Durkheim supple- ments his argument using data on within-religion suicide rates among a subsample of provinces ([18971 1966, p. 154). This is in some ways like the</page><page sequence="8">154 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 strategy of the content analyst who upon finding covariance among fre- quencies between sampling units, returns to the individual sentences to verify his or her hunches. Since Durkheim was performing a secondary analysis of existing data, he was unable to recreate individual-level data. The content analyst does create his or her own data matrix, however. Thus, it seems reasonable that this matrix should include data on the relations (as well as on the meanings) that its creator intends to evaluate. Markoff et al. argue that the coding of content should ideally be "as close as possible to the contents of the original documents," enabling the researcher "to subject the same data file to a wide variety of different analyses, many of which had not been, and could not have been, foreseen at the time the code was constructed" (1974, p. 3). In this sense, coding in content analysis has been likened to the process of translation from one language (text) to another (numbers) (Andren 1981). The more closely the coded data correspond to the content, the more valid is the translation. To the extent that dassifications of words are coded to the exclusion of rela- tions among words within texts, one's coding strategy provides an inade- quate translation. The following sections describe and illustrate a technique for coding sentences into a data matrix which can be "translated" back into text. At present, the only software available to assist in this type of coding requires the manual entry of codes. That is, the technique is not yet "computer- ized" in a form like that of the General Inquirer, MCCA, TEXTPACK, WORDS, etc. The software does demonstrate the feasibility of an auto- mated coding strategy that both classifies words into meaning categories and identifies the relations among them, however. The coding program provides coders with a paraphrase of the text being coded. With this para- phrase, the coder can readily verify whether the data accurately reflect the relations among words depicted in the original text. Clause Types (see also Appendix B) The most fundamental aspect of the linguistic approach to content analy- sis (LCA) is the classification of dauses (single combinations of associated subject and predicate) according to one of four types of communications that their creator intended to convey: (a) PERCEPTION: X Ys Z. OR X Ys. OR Z is Yed. The most common intent-type is of clauses that were intended to commu- nicate past, present, or possible observations. Perceptions describe processes (or sequences of events) that take place over time. Statements such as "The boy ran home" or "The pitcher threw the ball" are both of this type. The less abstract the verb (i.e., the Y) in a perception, the more concrete</page><page sequence="9">Linguistic Content Analysis / 155 will be its intended referent (viz., the empirical process it describes). Thus, perceptions range from very specific statements like the two just mentioned to those of a very general nature such as "John confirmed the rumor" or "Spain did not accept the treaty." Only clauses of this type can be coded in passive voice. (b) RECOGNMON: That is a Z. OR X is a Z. A statement of recognition is a dause in which the referent of one word is asserted to be a subset of a particular category. In contrast to the processes described by perceptions, recognitions describe states of affairs. They repre- sent extratemporal reflections from the specific to the general. The less concrete the empirical referent (i.e., the X) in a recognition, the more abstract must be the category (i.e., the Z) into which it is classified. Ac- cordingly, these statements range from the more specific, "There's my wallet," to the more abstract, "A cirde is not a polygon."6 (c) JUSTIFICATION: Ymg Z is right/wrong. OR X's Ying Z is (in)appropriate. A justification is a statement about the appropriateness of a particular activity. Unlike perceptions, justifications are not intended to describe, but to judge the rightness or wrongness of a process. They may appeal to rules of conduct that have situational or universal relevance. A justification is situational if the agent of the judged process (i.e., the X) is explicit, other- wise the clause implies universality. Thus, such statements include both situational assertions of appropriate technique ("Now you're holding the axe correctly") and universal appeals to higher principles ("It's wrong to axe your parents"). (d) EVALUATION: X is good/bad. OR X is (in)sufficient for Z. Evaluations are judgments about the usefulness of phenomena. Unlike recognitions, evaluations are not intended to classify, but to judge the goodness or badness of a state of affairs as a manifestation of a category. That is to say, in clauses of this type, phenomena are assessed in compari- son with ideals. When the source of the judgment (i.e., the Z) is not specified, evaluations depict usefulness as inherent in the subject (i.e., the X). Otherwise, the subject's usefulness is depicted as relative to the pur- poses of some individual or group. Thus, statements of this sort include both depictions of the inherent usefulness of the subject ("I am the great- est") and portrayals of the subject's usefulness to one or more individuals ("He's a good friend to us, but a terrible manager for you").7 It is essential that coders also note clause valence to clarify whether "X does or does not Y Z"; whether "Something is or is not a Z"; whether "Ying Z is right or wrong"; or whether "X is good or bad." In addition to coding clause type, valence, and identifying information (viz., source</page><page sequence="10">156 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 Table 2.

Both clauses in this sentence are perceptions (code = 1). The first clause is in the past tense (code = 1); the second is in the future tense (code = 3). The first clause indicates that the party members (code= 135) demanded (code = 13) an action (code = 73) toward some official Nazi literature (code = 140). The second clause is subordinated to the first with the conjunc- tion, "which" (code = 9). The subordinate clause reads that the periodi- cals (code = 140) ought (code = 2) to convey information about (code = 15) party members' (code = 135) activities (code = 73). In the original and para- phrased sentences the conjunction replaces its referent (viz., Nazi litera- ture) in the subordinate clause. The resulting computer-generated para- phrase of these two lines of data is The MEMBERS DEMANDED/OBLIGED a(n) ACTION toward LITERATURE, which [will BE OBLIGATED TO CONVEY a(n) MEMBER's ACTION]. Lost in the translation are "in Weimar" and "in short, fundamental, and programmatic essays" as well as the inevitable distinctions between coding categories and actual wordings (i.e., between "1926 party con- vention" and "members," between "requesting" and "demand/obliging," etc.). Retained are the relations, "who demanded what," "whose behavior ought to be conveyed," "what should convey what," and so on. That is, although some detail is lost, the original relations among the words are retained and can be incorporated into subsequent analyses.9 Analysis of an LCA data matrix such as that in Table 3 usually requires that clause types be considered separately. Notice, for example, how the first clause in the 1933 preface changes from</page><page sequence="15">Linguistic Content Analysis / 161 The NATIONAL/SOCIALISM's LITERATURE is not ABLE to be ACTED toward. to BEing ABLE to ACT toward NATIONAL/SOCIALISM's LITERATURE is wrong. when the clause type is altered from a perception to a justification. Clear- ly, the meanings of clauses change dramatically according to the clause- type to which they are assigned. Returning to Table 3, we find almost three quarters of the clauses in the prefaces to be perceptions (clause type= 1). With the exceptions of a single justification in the 1927 preface (National Socialism is appropriate to the tasks of our public life) and a single evaluation in the 1933 preface (the points of the platform are distinguished by a great determination), all other clauses in the prefaces are recognitions (clause type=2). There are 17 percent more perceptions (and 17% fewer recognitions) in the 1933 than in the 1927 preface. Since there appears to be no clear pattern of differ- ences in the recognitions between the two prefaces, the subsequent data analysis will deal exclusively with manifestations of the most numerous clause type, perception. The meaning of a clause not only varies dramatically with its clause type, but also as its valence changes from "giving" to "not giving," for example. Other important relations among instances of coding categories may include those of speaker and audience, if transcripts of conversations are coded. Most generally, the syntactic relations to be considered in any particular analysis will depend on the research problem at hand. The theoretical motivation for analyzing the prefaces was to explore whether Nazi ideas were more utopian in 1927 and more ideological in 1933. Let us begin with a few descriptive statements from the LCA data set in Table 3: Among the perceptions (clause type= 1) in the two prefaces to the Nazi party platform, 30 percent more were negatively stated in 1933 (7 out of 19 clauses) than in 1927 (1 out of 15 clauses). Half of the subordinate clauses in the 1933 preface (3 out of 6) are subordinated with the conjunction, "because" (code=6), whereas none of the six subordinate clauses in the 1927 preface is subordinated with this conjunction. The uses of negation in the 1933 preface are all assurances of consistency (i.e., that things have and will not change) in Nazi promises and activities. These uses are that the program can not be changed; the movement could not be impeded; National Socialism does not have decrepit literature; tacti- cal necessities were not blocked; it will not be considered that the pro- gram's demands are not pursued; and National Socialism will not disap- point the German people. In the 1927 preface the only negatively stated</page><page sequence="16">162 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 Table 3.

Likewise, the uses of the conjunction, "because," explain how different activities (familiarization with Nazi ideals, inclusion of previous prefaces, and perception that programmatic demands are pursued) stem from honorable motivations (the achievement of Nazi aims, a review of struggle and achievement, the refusal to alter documents).

Two observations should be made at this point: first, the empirical statements of the preceding paragraph require only simple word counts. The greater use of negation in 1933 than in 1927 could have been found by counting instances of "not" and "no longer" in the two prefaces. Counts of "since" and "in order that" would show the more frequent occurrences of because-conjunctions in the 1933 than in the 1927 preface. Conse- quently, the advantage of linguistic content analysis over word count ap- proaches remains to be demonstrated. Second, we have so far only considered the depiction of Nazi ideas in 1927 by default (i.e., as not couched in the negative- and because-con- structions typical of the 1933 preface). Once again, recall our theoretical purpose to explore whether Nazi ideas shifted between 1927 and 1933 from utopian to ideological in nature. According to Mannheim, this need not imply that Nazi ideas changed during the period, but that the ideas' relations to a changing political environment may have altered. Thus, it is necessary to consider how one might distinguish utopian from ideological references to Nazi ideas. The earlier discussion of the 1933 preface suggests that ideological references are to Nazi ideas' not being altered, but being acted upon. In contrast, references to official Nazi literature in the 1927 preface are to an anthropomorphized entity that "should deal with members' political life," "should give a picture of the appropriateness of National Socialist de- meanor," "should differ from commonplace writings," "should dare to</page><page sequence="18">164 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 venture beyond retrospection," "should not allow every opinion to be spoken," and "must convey National Socialist ideals." That is to say, 1927 references are to Nazi literature as the active (even intentional) subject of clauses, whereas 1933 references depict Nazi literature as the object around which activities are oriented. Table 4 shows this subject-to-object shift to be statistically significant (p=.0175) between prefaces. If one con- siders each preface's eight references to official Nazi literature within per- ceptions, these references are 50% more often the subjects (and 50% less often the objects) of clauses in the 1927 than the 1933 preface. Since the above analysis is an exploratory case study of utopian and ideological syntax within two short texts, conclusions must be descriptive and only tentatively generalized to larger populations of texts. Thus it is only to the degree that the 1927 preface is representative of utopian texts and that the 1933 preface is representative of ideological texts that one might infer the generality of (a) official literature's active character as the subject of clauses in utopian texts and (b) its passive character as the object in clauses of ideological texts. Similar reservations should be made regarding generalizations about anthropomorphic depictions of official lit- erature in utopian texts and about apologetic assurances of fidelity to offi- cial literature in ideological texts. Beyond these tentative empirical generalizations, this analysis also serves to demonstrate how the coding of syntactic information improves on content analyses restricted to word count methodology. By counting instances of the word category, "official literature," one finds an equal number of instances within each preface. No examination of co-occurring words or phrases would afford a content analyst the differences in syntac- tic usage of "official literature" presented in Table 4. The advantage of lin- guistic content analysis is that in addition to semantic information (i.e., frequencies of meaning categories), syntactic information (i.e., the gram- matical relations among instances of these meaning categories) can be ob- tained and analyzed by directly accessing the coded data, without need to return to the original texts for ad hoc verification. Ambiguity The inherent ambiguity of language makes the application of the coding technique nontrivial. In particular, the selection of the appropriate clause type requires considerable Verstehen from coders. The coder must be fa- miliar with both the context in which a statement is made and the cultural universe within which it was intended to have meaning. Two decisions must be made in determining which intent-type is appropriate to a clause. On the one hand, the coder must decide whether the clause is about a process or a state of affairs. In addition, the coder must decide whether this process or state of affairs is being judged or merely described.</page><page sequence="19">Linguistic Content Analysis / 165 Table 4.

Cell frequencies are in parentheses. Fisher's exact test: p =.0175 Paul Lazarsfeld used to illustrate the ambiguity of language by ask- ing his methods classes to consider what sort of answer is requested by the question, Why did you buy that book?10 The speaker may wish to know why "anyone" might buy such a book, why the listener did not "do something else with" (e.g., steal) the book, why the listener did not buy "another" book, or why the listener did not buy "something besides" a book. Clearly, the meaning of the question depends on the context in which it is asked. Following Lazarsfeld's lead, the dependence of LCA coding on coders' sympathetic understanding can be illustrated by showing how the declarative sentence, "John bought that book," can be classified under each of the intent-types as it appears within different social contexts. The sentence would be coded as a perception if it was imbedded in the following context: (la) We both went to the store. Then John bought that book. Here the speaker is simply describing a process of sensory phenomena (or an activity) that he or she has experienced. The intention is to communi- cate a perception of these phenomena. Within this context the LCA para- phrase of the sentence would be, (lb) JOHN BOUGHT a BOOK. The intent of the sentence changes considerably when the context is (2a) I pointed out that he might be arrested if he stole it. Fortunately, John bought that book. Within this context the same phrase strongly implies that the activity of "buying that book" was appropriate. The phrase is intended to communi-</page><page sequence="20">166 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 cate a justification of the activity as "right" (or appropriate). The com- puter-generated paraphrase of this sentence would be (2b) JOHN's BUYing a BOOK was appropriate. Changing the context again, we have, (3a) John is an excellent cook. From all the cookbooks in the store, John bought that book. Here a judgment is being made about a state of affairs and not (as within the previous context) about an activity. The phrase evaluates the cookbook in comparison to other cookbooks in the store. The program would render the phrase as follows: (3b) The COOKBOOK is good. Finally, consider the context, (4a) I'm trying to figure out what he spent his allowance on. Aaah, John bought that book! In this context the speaker recognizes the state of affairs that a phenome- non (the book) falls into the category "what John spent his allowance on." The paraphrased sentence would be (4b) The BOOK is JOHN's PURCHASE. (Notice here that "purchase" is the nominal form of the verb, "to buy.") As the above examples suggest, the intent of some statements is more ambiguous than that of others. In addition to the intent-types indi- cated, the last three contexts also communicate the perception of John's buying a book. The coder must decide which of the four intent-types most strongly motivated the expression of the dause being coded. Furthermore, the degree of ambiguity in a text varies not only according to its author's ability to write unambiguously, but also according to the text's purpose. That is, purely descriptive texts or texts intended to convey specific infor- mation will have fewer ambiguities and will afford clearer judgments to the coder. Texts of conversations are likely to have more ambiguity. And artistic works such as poetry and lyrics have the greatest likelihood for ambiguity. The advantage of this coding strategy is that it makes explicit exactly in which statements the ambiguities lie. Also notice that the prob- lem of ambiguity lies with the text, not with the coding scheme. To evaluate the degree of inter-rater agreement in the coding of ambiguous texts, two coders applied LCA coding to some texts of English translations (from Latin) of exorcism accounts from the Middle Ages (52 clauses total). Such texts are frequently ambiguous, as narrators relate supernatural or mystical events generally considered intrinsically ineffa- ble by the narrators themselves. (When analyzing an analogous sample</page><page sequence="21">Linguistic Content Analysis / 167 of folk tales, Kelly and Stone [1975] found automated disambiguation much less effective than when analyzing texts on more "realistic" topics.) Eighty-four percent of the clauses coded by either coder were coded in common by both. Kappa statistics calculated on these dauses are (a) k= .66 on coders' selection of the same intent-type and (b) k=.79 on their coding of manifest content.-1 Thus, adequate rater agreement can be ob- tained with LCA coding even when it is applied to ambiguous texts. Finally, it should be pointed out that Verstehen is not being de- picted as an advantageous feature of LCA. On the contrary, it has been argued that the Verstehen used in qualitative content analyses may lead to irreplicable results. Instead, the argument here is that the coding of syn- tactic relations requires some Verstehen. The costs to replicability are less with LCA than with qualitative content analysis techniques, which typi- cally apply Verstehen to larger blocks of text than the dause. Although costs to replicability are greater with LCA than with computer-aided con- tent analysis, these costs are more than offset by the additional informa- tion gained in the form of syntactic relations among words. With this syntactic information, empirical correlations need not be verified with ad hoc inspections of original texts. Linguistics and Content Analysis With a few noted exceptions (Hays 1969; Lindkvist 1981; Markoff, Shapiro &amp; Weitman 1974; Saporta &amp; Sebeck 1959), social scientists' writings on content analysis either mention linguistics only in passing or ignore it altogether. Another notable exception is the development of an automated syntactic content analysis program by Gottschalk, Hausmann, and Brown (1975)-a special purpose program that evaluates clauses, assigning them scores on a number of psychological scales. Despite the relative inatten- tion to the potential contribution of linguistics to content analysis method- ology, important advances have been made in the field. Linguists' discus- sions of types of intention have expanded from isolated intent-categories that apply only to occasional sentences (e.g., Searle's 1975 "indirect direc- tives") to general theories of intention (Searle &amp; Vanderveken 1985). Other recent advances in linguistics research suggest not only the feasibility of a linguistic approach to content analysis, but also the possibility of auto- mated linguistic coding of textual data. Much contemporary linguistic research has focused on the problem of natural language processing. This research elicits the aid of computers in representing texts according to any of a number of systematic formats. As a result, the obstades that linguistic researchers must overcome are often similar to those that must be surpassed in order to automate the</page><page sequence="22">168 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 LCA representation of texts as numbers. Three approaches to natural lan- guage processing appear to be particularly relevant. First, there is the artificial intelligence approach of Roger Schank and associates at Yale (Schank &amp; Abelson 1977; Schank, Lebowitz &amp; Bim- baum 1980). On the basis of Schank's (1975) theory of conceptual depen- dency, a number of programs have been written that store information in the way the mind is hypothesized to store it. In analyzing a sentence, these programs bring information about the world to the text at hand. For example, in processing the statement, The waitress accidentally dropped food on a customer. a program might include in its rendering of the incident a mention of the waitress's embarrassment-a detail not mentioned in the original descrip- tion. The world-knowledge that such a program brings to a text may be useful, for example, in determining whether the above statement was intended to communicate a "perception" of food being dropped or an "evaluation" of the waitress's competence. Even once its clause-type is determined, much of the content of a clause depends on preceding sentences. The text linguistics approach to natural language processing emphasizes the importance of the context of a sentence in determining its meaning (de Beaugrande &amp; Dressler 1981).12 That is, the sentence, He did it. is devoid of meaning unless one knows what "he" and "it" refer to. Like the world-knowledge of artificial intelligence programs, the contextual knowledge of text linguistic programs may also facilitate the automation of LCA coding. A third linguistic approach is that of mechanical translation (e.g., Hutchins 1982; Mel'cuk &amp; Zolkovskij 1970). Since the goal of LCA coding is the mapping of texts into a data matrix that can be translated into a valid paraphrase of the original texts, this approach may be most directly appli- cable to the problem of automating LCA. The type of translation program that would afford this automation would most likely use insights from the two previous approaches as it developed an LCA data matrix somewhere in the process from the input of the original text to the output of a valid paraphrase. Applications In 1952 Berelson described the uses of content analysis as being in the investigation of "the characteristics of communication content, the causes of content, and the consequences of content" (p. 26; original emphasis). Under</page><page sequence="23">Linguistic Content Analysis / 169 these general categories he listed a number of research topics for which content analyses are appropriate-topics which have retained currency for more than three decades (cf. Weber 1985, p. 9). For brevity, let us consider one topic of investigation within each of the more general categories Berel- son outlined: (a) the characteristics of propaganda techniques (b) psychological states of persons or groups as the cause of communi- cation (c) attitudinal and behavioral consequences of communication When word-count approaches have been applied to these and other re- search topics, evidence has consisted in covariances of frequencies of words within meaning categories and/or associations between word- counts and contextual data. As a consequence, research questions have been restricted to questions about themes (semantics) and not grammars (syntax) of texts. For example, in investigating the above-mentioned topics content analysts have posited general research questions such as (a) What themes are mentioned in propaganda that are not mentioned in other communications? (b) What themes are uttered by persons or groups in one psychological state and not in another? (c) What attitudinal or behavioral responses follow after specific themes are mentioned? In addition to such traditional questions about themes within communica- tions, linguistic content analysis also enables the three research topics (and more) to be pursued via questions regarding syntax: (a) What syntactic strategies are used by political leaders when their poli- cies fail (or succeed)? (b) Can definitions of the situation be defined according to discrete sets of legitimate grammars? (c) What is the syntax of negatively versus positively reinforcing state- ments? It must be acknowledged that these last three questions are not of the sort commonly asked by social theorists. On the other hand, current sociologi- cal writings have almost no theories that posit concrete relations between types of communications and social action. LCA research may help pro- vide an empirical base from which such theories might be developed.</page><page sequence="24">170 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 Discussion This paper has outlined a strategy for the quantification of language. The strategy was demonstrated to generate measures with both face validity and inter-rater agreement. However, the true test of the strategy's utility is a logistic one. The manual application of LCA coding requires that coders have had rigorous training in technical grammar, allowing them to cor- rectly parse texts into clauses and parts of speech. Even with such train- ing, coding takes time. A trained coder took almost two hours to code the two prefaces to the Nazi party platform. This will be too costly for most researchers, although careful sampling of texts should reduce costs some- what. Those who are more quantitatively oriented may object that inter- coder agreement is not high enough to warrant using the technique. There is, of course, no satisfactory response to this criticism, given the relativity of the term "high enough." Instead, the application of innovations from the fields of artificial intelligence, text linguistics, and mechanical transla- tion may aid in the development of an automated LCA program that may supply a less controversial resolution to the objection. Linguistic content analysis is a compromise strategy that avoids the shortcomings of both qualitative and computer-aided approaches to con- tent analysis. When a qualitative (or impressionistic) approach is used, coders are less likely to be systematic in recording their impressions. In the approach outlined here, coders' interpretations must be grounded in each clause of the text and are thus unlikely to stray too far from the original intent. Inter-coder agreement is likely to be greater when cod- ers use a computer-aided approach in which frequencies within meaning categories are analyzed. However, the intended meanings of the texts are often lost in this process. By coding clauses according to their intents and by fitting manifest content into fixed syntaxes, the linguistic approach to content analysis assures both validity and objectivity. Furthermore, the approach improves upon contemporary computer-aided content analysis methodology in that conclusions do not require that statistical findings be verified post hoc with an inspection of the texts under analysis. Although no social encounter can occur without language, analyses of people's words remain on the periphery of sociological research. Lin- guistic content analysis may aid in expanding the scope of communica- tions research beyond research questions about themes in communica- tions to questions about the role of the grammar of communications in social action. By enabling the researcher to map language into numbers, linguistic content analysis may afford sociologists the rigor needed to take our words seriously.</page><page sequence="25">Linguistic Content Analysis / 171 Appendix A |3invriort aur' 10. ffage Zer fpartettag 1926 im !leimar tat bit .,traudga6t tiner Ec~triftens teOtt sewanin t, bie iin turaen, grunbiegenben unb progranimaticd)en 916v tanbtunqen Oite tvic4tistt oJtbiete un erte pfeamien poIitifcoen 2eend b4,anbeln [olutc.

Appendix A2. 1933 Preface to the Nazi Party Platform.</page><page sequence="27">Linguistic Content Analysis / 173 Appendix B In reading earlier drafts of this paper, colleagues have repeatedly asked that the four types of clauses be placed within the context of linguistic theory. This appendix is a response to these requests. Since this paper is primarily directed to an audience of sociologists, these remarks have not appeared in the body of the text. The four LCA clause-types can be viewed as grounded in Saussure's ([1916J 1966) concepts of signified/signifier and synchrony/diachrony.13 Saussure pointed out that words simultaneously correspond to worldly phenomena (signifieds) and cohere with other words (signifiers). Words can be said to "cohere" if they are used in a socially (i.e., normatively as well as grammafically) appropriate manner. In speech, these two characteristics are manifest as a tension insofar as their use lacks the characteristics of correspondence and coherence. For example, this tension would be great if the symbol, "chair," were applied to what one would normally refer to as a large pillow. The tension generally results in a judgment of the degree to which the symbol fits the phenomenon to which it has been applied. (E.g., it makes a great pillow, but a rotten chair.) Judgments that refer to static arrangements (i.e., to synchrony) have been labeled evaluations in this paper. Judgments referring to dynamic processes (i.e., to diachrony) have been labeled justifications. When utterances entail little tension between signified and signifier, they have been labeled as recognitions when they refer to arrangements and as perceptions when they refer to processes. Thus, each of the four types of clauses can be viewed as conveying either a synchrony or diachrony with either a high or low tension between signifier and signified. This two-by-two representation of the clause-types is presented in Table 1A. The structure of language described by Saussure was not tied to a grammar (or syntax) as are the four clause-types that form the heart of LCA. The attempt to describe a universal linguistic structure with syntactic rules originated with Noam Chomsky's writings during the mid-1950s. According to Chomsky (1957), all linguistic expressions are grounded in the same "generative grammar." A slightly hyperbolic rendering of this view is that the meanings of words are determined by grammar (i.e., by how they are used in a sentence). In a series of lectures given at Harvard in 1955, John Austin suggested another direc- tion for linguists' efforts to understand the structure of language. Austin argued that linguis- tic expressions (or "speech acts") have not only a locutionary meaning (i.e., both sense and reference [{1962} 1975, p. 95 ff.]), but also an illocutionary force (i.e., an intentional compo- nent). To make his point, Austin outlined a set of categories allowing speech acts to be classified according to the intent of those who utter them.14 Much of what has been written in the field of linguistics during the last few decades has built upon the ideas of Austin and Chomsky. John Searle and others have offered refine- ments of the intent-types described by Austin (cf. Searle and Vanderveken 1985).15 Jerrold Katz and Paul Postal (1964), and others have worked on developing a still illusive generative grammar (cf. Harris 1985). These two approaches to describing the structure of language have generally been researched in isolation, however. The coding strategy introduced in this paper maps the structure of language by using insights from both the Austin and Chomsky schools. Following Austin, each speech act is classified according to its intent. Instead of positing a single "generative grammar," Chom- sky's approach is modified by associating a specific syntax (or grammar) with each of four types of intention. Saussure provides the theoretical focus around which this synthesis is constructed.</page><page sequence="28">174 / Social Forces Volume 68:1, September 1989 Table LA. REPRESENTATION OF FOUR INTENT-TYPES ACCORDING TO SAUSSURE'S CONCEPTS OF SIGNIFIED/SIGNIFIER AND SYNCHRONY/DIACHRONY Bype of Linguistic Reference Tension Between Signifier and Synchrony Diachrony Signified (static arrangement) (dynamic process) Low Recognition Perception High Evaluation Justification Notes 1. For example, tiny, small, minute, little, puny, etc. are words that might be classified into a single, more general meaning category labeled, "small." 2.

Schmidt, Department of German and Russian, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403 or c/o Roy A. Boggs, Department of Information Systems, Univer- sity of South Florida, Fort Myers, FL 33907. 3. This insight stems from a conversation with Robert Philip Weber. 4. For the purpose of this article, the words periodical(s), program(matic), pamphlet(s), work(s), writing(s), literature, handwritten draft, points (i.e., the "25 points" set forth in the party program), and preface(s) are included in the meaning category "official literature." To simplify discussions here, the meaning category "give" includes only the words give and given. A more generally applicable meaning category might also include such words as show, indicate, deal (with), describe, etc. 5. It should be mentioned here that since KWIC programs can be used to identify relations among words, relation-codes can in principle be manually added to one's data matrix of frequencies (cf. Wood 1984). When this is done, the coding of relations (unlike that of mean- ing categories) is not performed directly by computer. The purpose of this paper is to outline a strategy for coding texts that potentially allows the simultaneous automated coding of words and their interrelations. 6. To the extent that words can be thought of as lying along a dimension of abstraction, perceptions and recognitions can likewise be portrayed as ranging along a dimension from abstract to concrete. The more abstract a word is, the broader the range of empirical referents it has (i.e., the more general its application); the more specific the word, the more concrete its empirical referents. This has two consequences: (a) In descriptions of processes, the less abstract the verb that describes the process, the more concrete will be its intended referent (viz., the empirical process it describes). (b) In descriptions of states of affairs, the less con- crete the noun that corresponds to a given state of affairs, the more abstract the category must be into which it is classified. When a statement involves a judgment, the judged pro- cess or state of affairs can also be placed along an abstract-concrete dimension. However, unlike descriptions, judgments additionally imply either universal or situational relevance. In the case of justifications, a particular process may be universally right (wrong) or only appro- priate (inappropriate) within certain social situations. Evaluations may imply either that a state of affairs is inherently useful (useless) or merely useful (useless) for the purposes of an individual or social group. Distinct from its abstract-concrete dimensionality, the relevance of a judgment is thus not continuous, but dichotomous-implying either universal or situ- ational applicability.</page><page sequence="29">Linguistic Content Analysis / 175 7. In English, good and right (or bad and wrong) are often used identically. (e.g., "It's bad to axe your parents" or "He's the right friend for me.") In lieu of unambiguous English judgmental adverbs, these words have been assigned technical meanings: Processes are judged as right or wrong; states of affairs as good or bad. 8. PLCA (Program for Linguistic Content Analysis) was used. in generating Table 3 and the right column of Table 2. The program has a basic vocabulary of 21 verbs, 9 modal auxiliary verbs, 2 object codes, and 4 person codes. To code the prefaces the program's vocabulary was increased by 5 verbs (demand/oblige, convey, appoint, pursue/actualize, utilize), 4 objects (situation, movement, government, Germany), and 6 persons, groups of persons, or anthro- pomorphized objects (Hitler, field marshal, Nazi party members, Nazi leaders, National So- cialism, official Nazi literature). The current version of PLCA runs on MS DOS and has a parallel install program that allows the user to alter the program's vocabulary. The program is available from IRIS Systems Inc., 1221 Mamie Eisenhower, Boone, IA 50036. 9. As with any coding scheme, detail is lost as data are coded at a higher order of abstraction. The fewer meaning categories in the scheme, the further the translation is from the original. Generally speaking, instances of an LCA meaning category are not necessarily identical to manifest occurrences of a word. Consider the verb, "to give." In Table 2, the LCA rendering of "These pamphlets should give a uniform and complete picture" is "The LITERATURE will BE OBLIGATED TO DESCRIBE." However, the LCA rendering of "I present the first pam- phlet" is "I GIVE/PROVIDE a(n) LITERATURE." More generally, the exclusion or inclusion of words in meaning categories depends more on their usages than on their manifest forms. In the case of the verb-category, "to give," the coder applies the category only if the object of the giving is a phenomenon of which one can relinquish possession. Thus the statement that the pamphlet will "give a picture" most likely refers to what the pamphlet will describe, rather than to how well illustrated its pages are. 10. This anecdote was brought to my attention during a personal conversation with Hanan Selvin. 11. Kappa (k) is a measure of the proportion of raters' agreement in dassifying units of analysis according to nominal categories. The statistic corrects for the inter-rater agreement one would expect to occur by chance (Cohen 1960; Fleiss, Nee &amp; Landis 1979). 12. Also see de Beaugrande (1980) for an excellent review of text linguistics research. 13. I am indebted to Peter Ph. Mohler for suggesting the existence of parallels between my ideas and those of Saussure. 14. Austin used the term "illocution" instead of "intent," since the latter term might be misunderstood to imply that he was concerned with identifying deceptive speech acts (i.e., speech acts that differ from the tacit wishes of their source) or with the "pragmatics" of speech. In contrast, the illocutionary force of a speech act is the intent it is conventionally assigned in everyday speech, e.g., as a warning, an order, a concession, etc. At the risk of being misunderstood, I shall continue to use the more familiar term, "intent." 15. The reader familiar with Austin's and Searle's writings should be cautioned not to expect dear parallels between either of their sets of intent-types and those outlined in this paper. Without entering into detailed comparisons, it can be mentioned that the present scheme uses verb tenses and modalities to afford a simpler method of classifying utterances accord- ing to their intentions. In illustration, consider the intent-type, "commissive"-the only cate- gory of intention common to Austin and Searle. Both linguists indicate that a "promise" exemplifies the commissive utterance, "the whole point of (which) is to commit the speaker to a future course of action" (Searle and Vanderveken 1985, p. 100). Using LCA, the verb, "to promise," would be coded in the future tense with the modal verb, "to be obligated to." For example, "I promise to help" is coded as "I shall be obligated to help."
