The Chemical Structure of a Novel Platinum Blue Complex. - Information concerning the structures of platinum blue complexes is limited because they represent an unusual class of coordination com- pounds. Of the currently known platinum blues, several have been examined in terms of their effectiveness as anti- tumor agents (Burness et al., Journal of Clinical Hematol- ogy and Oncology; 7(2), 508, 1977). It is also noteworthy to mention that many of these blue complexes are of mixed-valent, metal-metal bonded, and ligand-bridged poly- mers (Arrizabalaga et al., Inorg. Chem. 1985, 24, 3656). A novel platinum blue complex has been prepared by the reaction between 1,2-cyclohexanedionedioxime and potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II). This complex has presented several difficulties in the determination of its structure, especially since it is amorphous. Studies of the stoichiometry of the reaction by the method of continuous variation suggest that the Pt-to-ligand mole ratio is non- integral. This paper will discuss the methods of prepara- tion of the blue solid and details concerning some possi- ble structures.

An Algorithm for Economic and Secure Generation Planning . - If generator cost characteristics, load profile and impedances in a power system are known, generation cost can be optimized by solving a mathematical minimization problem. Based on system impedances load flow equations can be dev- eloped and included in the cost minimization problem as equality constraints. The generator output limits can be included as inequalities. Line loading limits can be included as additional inequalities for security. The resulting overall problem is known as an optimal load flow problem. This problem involves real as well as reactive powers. It is well known that real powers are more sensitive to bus voltage angles and reactive powers are more sensitive to bus voltage magnitudes. The problem can, therefore, be decomposed into two subproblems, one dealing with real powers and tThe abstracts published herein have not been subjected to editorial scrutiny. * Author (s) presenting the paper. the other with reactive powers. The formulation is pre- sented in this paper. Approaches to minimize computa- tional time are discussed and a method for convergence of the subproblem solutions to obtain the solution of overall problem is presented. Successful results on an IEEE power system are presented. Andreassi, John L.*, Michael D. Metzger and Shyamal K. Majumdar, Department of Biology, Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042. Genotoxic Effects of Taxol on Murine Erythroleukemic Cells. - Taxol is an anticancer drug that binds to the ß-subunit of tubulin and acts as a microtubule stabilizer. The effects of taxol on murine erythroleukemic GM-86 (MEL) cells were studied with respect to: cell multiplication, viability, mitotic index, micronucleation, multinucleated cells and chromosomes. Compared to the control, taxol treated cells (0.05-10^g/ml) exhibited static growth with an increase in cell death over prolonged treat- ment periods (12-120 hours). Taxol treatments compared to the control groups resulted in an increase of mitotic index, micronucleation and multinucleated cells; these effects were drug concentrations and time dependent. Exposure of cells to taxol induced a dose and time depen- dent increase in chromosome numbers and in frequency of chromosomal aberrations. This study reveals that taxol exerts its inhibitory effect by arresting cells in the mitotic phases. In addition, the chromosome damage produced as a result of taxol treatment further compounded its negative impact on the cell proliferation.

A Study of the Implementation of Statistical Quality Control Methods in the Selected Industrial Organizations of Pennsylvania. - A new economic age is developing in which the demand for quality is increasing, with a resulting global competition of companies striving to provide that quality. The detection system of final inspection, a costly method of quality control, is giving way to a prevention system that utilizes in-process inspection and statistical quality control to build quality into a process. This paper describes the results of the research which was conducted recently to study the implementation of statistical quality control in the industrial organizations of Pennsylvania. The three principal objectives of this study were as follows:</page><page sequence="20">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 169 (i) To conduct research regarding the techniques and the tools employed by the Pennsylvania's industrial organiza- tions for the implementation of statistical quality control. (ii) To conduct research regarding the statistical quality control training and education activities currently being conducted in Pennsylvania's industrial organizations. (iii) To conduct research regarding the future plans of Pennsylvania's companies for the development of various aspects of statistical quality control within the organizations. The methodology employed for conducting the above- mentioned study consisted of surveys (by mail), on-site visits, and interviews (both face-to-face and on phone). The results of this study reveal that the industrial organi- zations in Pennsylvania are utilizing a wide spectrum of tools and techniques for the implementation of statistical quality control in a large number of different processes. There is also a significant variation in the approaches used by these companies for providing education/training related to statistical quality control to their employees. It is the objective of this paper to discuss and explain the current state of the implemenation of statistical quality control in Pennsylvania's industry as described by the above-mentioned study.

A Taxonomie Study of Eupatorium rotundifolium sensu lato . -Eupatorium rotundifolium s.l. is a group of plants that has been treated in various ways by different authors. This study focuses on lead and flower morphology by means of a multivariate analysis of 24 characters to deter- mine whether the current recognition of E. pilosum as a species and E. rotundifolium var. rotundifolium and E. rotundifolium var. ovatum as varieties in Pennsylvania is supported by morphological evidence. Previous authors working on this group have stated that there is no pollen produced, and the group is apomictic. Recent observations of pollen on many herbarium specimens, however, indi- cate this is not the case. Therefore another aspect of this study focuses on determining the presence or absence of viable pollen. Ashton, Michael R.* and Daniel S.

A Comparative Study of Benthie Macro- invertebrates in Roaring Brook , Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. - This study determined seasonal patterns of richness, abundance, and diversity of benthie macro- invertebrates in Roaring Brook, Lackawanna County, PA, as they change along the length of the stream. Using a Surber stream sampler, samples were taken at each of three sites along Roaring Brook at four different times; three times in the summer and once in the fall of 1992. No substantial fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, water temperature, of pH were recorded. Macroinvertebrates were classified to the genus level whenever possible, and their communities were analyzed in three categories: EPT (insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera), non-EPT, and total community. EPT richness and diver- sity were significantly lower downstream than upstream, with macroinvertebrate richness, abundance, and diver- sity decreasing as the stream flows through less rural terrain, suggesting a decline in the overall water quality of Roaring Brook.

Pilot Study of Tursiops truncatus.- Shore and occasional boat surveys of wild Atlantic bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the coastal waters of Brigantine, New Jersey, were conducted between June and August in 1993. Pod size, frequency of sightings, and drawings of natural markings on individual dorsal fins were evaluated to determine which dolphin pods use Brig- antine waters as their seasonal home range. These resident pods constituted 31% of all observed dolphin pods in Brigantine. The behavior exhibited by these resident pods included feeding, traveling, sleeping, playing, interaction with other resident pods, and contact with humans. Feed- ing behaviors among resident pods exhibited no pattern in relation to time of day, location, or tides. This suggests that the resident pods have an opportunistic feeding life- style. The remaining 59% of the pods sighted were those that appeared to use the Brigantine waters only as a travel range, usually stopping to feed. Avila, G.*, CA. Domínguez and J.A.

Parental Effects on Fitness Components of Erythroxylum havanense. - Fruit and seed abortion provide several areas for natural selec- tion to operate in flowering plants. We investigated the occurrence of seed abortion and progeny performance in relation to parental identity in a tropical, distylous, peren- nial shrub. Genetic families were generated by means of hand pollinations. Pollen donor effects were present in 4 of the 9 fitness components considered, including seed pro- duction. No correlation between gametophytic and sporo- phytic performance was found. In contrast, maternal effects were predominant and accounted for a high pro- portion of the variance explained. A path analytical model shows that retarded fruit maturation is followed by delays in seed germination, which in turn worsen vegetative per- formance, thus rendering a decrease in juvenile probability of survival.

Woodcock (Scolopax minor) Habitat Suitability at One Natural Site and Three Re- claimed Strip Mines in Mercer Co., Pennsylvania.- Three reclaimed strip mines and a natural area in Mercer Co., PA</page><page sequence="21">170 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 were evaluated as habitat for the American woodcock (Scolopax minor) using the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In addi- tion, since woodcock rely heavily on earthworms as a food source, earthworm biomass at the four sites was deter- mined. The relationships between the earthworm biomass and the HSI, the woodcock sighting index, and soil characteristics were analyzed using a regression and cor- relation analysis. Results indicate that a linear relationship exists between soil characteristics and earthworm biomass in that loam soils support higher earthworm biomass. Based on the significant correlation between the woodcock sighting index and cover component of the HSI, cover appears to be more important than food in determining site use by woodcock.

Virucidal Effect of Sabaara (Guirea senegalensis) on HSV-2..-1 This work is an ongoing study searching for anti- viral acitivity in tropical plants. We report that the crude methanol extract of Guirea senegalensis exhibits virucidal activity against HSV-2 in vitro. Dried whole plants were extracted with organic solvents of increasing polarity. The anti-herpetic activity of each extract was assayed by pla- que reduction in Vero cells. For the assay, each extract was dissolved in DMSO, then the concentration adjusted with tissue culture medium. Results indicate strong anti-viral inhibition (76%) with as little as 0.25 mg/ml of crude methanol extract. Experiments comparing the addition of the extract to cells at different intervals during the virus replication cycle indicate viral inhibition was greatest when the extract was added to cells immediately after infection and allowed to remain on these cells for at least 24 hours. These results suggest that the methanol extract of Guirea sene- galensis contains a virucidal activity against HSV-2 in vitro. Becker, Theresa L.*, Scott E. Gygax and Steven W.

Isolation and Characterization of cDN A Clones Corresponding to the nimP Gene of Aspergillus nidulans- Mutations in the nimP (never-/n-mitosis) gene of Asper- gillus nidulans lead to cell cycle arrest; nimP'9 cells arrest at S-phase, whereas nimPll cells arrest in Gl (S. James, unpublished results). The occurrence of Gl- and S-arresting alleles of a single gene is unusual, and suggests that nimP may encode a regulator of the Gl/S transition. To study nimP function at the molecular level, we have isolated the nimP gene. Beginning with a 45kb cosmid clone bearing nimP (S. James, unpublished results), the gene was local- ized via subcloning and functional complementation to a 2.2kb genomic DNA fragment. As a result of screening an Aspergillus XgtlO cDNA library with the 2.2kb nimP- complementing fragment as a probe, five independent cDNAs corresponding to two different genes were ob- tained. Representative cDNA isolates are being character- ized via restriction enzyme analysis, functional comple- mentation of nimP mutations, and DNA sequencing.

Effects of a Hen's Egg Yolk Diet on the Lipid Composition of the Digestive Gland-Gonad Complex of Biomphalaria glabrata Infected with Larval Echinostoma caproni.- This study examined the effects of larval Echinostoma caproni infection on the neutral lipid composition of the digestive gland-gonad complex (DGG) of Biomphalaria glabrata snails fed a high fat diet of hen's egg yolk. Snails were experimentally infected with the miracidial stage of this echinostome and their DGGs analyzed for neutral lipids 5 weeks post-infection by quali- tative and quantitative thin-layer chromatography. The DGGs of infected snails showed a significant increase in free sterols, and a significant decrease in triacylglycerols when compared to uninfected control snails maintained on the hen's egg yolk diet. There was no significant difference in free fatty acids between infected and uninfected snails. The decrease in triacylglycerols in the DGGs of infected snails suggests that this nutrient was utilized by the intramolluscan stages of this echinostome. Biazzo, D.E.*, T. Schwegel and J.E.

Identification of a Novel Integration Site (int-V) for Mouse Mammary TUmor Virus in a BALB/cV Mammary TUmor. - Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMT V) is a type-B retrovirus which induces tumors by transcriptional activation of host genes located adjacent to proviral integration sites. Forty-four percent of a panel of BALB/cV tumors did not exhibit proviral inte- grations in known potential activation regions. A tumor was identified which contained a single acquired provirus in a novel site. We hypothesize that MMTV-induced inap- propriate expression of a gene in this region contributed to tumorigenesis. To isolate this novel integration site (int-V), we sequenced the cellular DNA adjacent to the 5' long terminal repeat element of the acquired provirus. A 24-base pair sequence unique to the int-V region was iden- tified and used to screen a BALB/c genomic library to isolate clones of the int-V region. Analysis of these clones for sequence signals required form mRNA splicing will per- mit the detection of the transcription unit activated by MMTV integration.

Succession of Woodlots in Lancaster County Using Stump Wood Identification. - Human activities have affected the composition of woody plant communities in much of the Easter Forest region over the past few centuries. Today Lancaster County woodlots are changing due to the influence of selective logging and livestock grazing. Former canopy species can be identified from their remnants: log- ged stumps. Microscopic sections taken from stump wood were used to identify the species of former significant</page><page sequence="22">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 171 members of the woodlot communities. Existing canopy species from these woodlots were compared to the species represented by the stumps. Evidence indicates that com- munities once dominated by oak and hickory are being replaced by a more mixed group including Liriodendron tulipifera.

A Survey of the Water-Quality Indicative Insects in the Hemlock Creek Drainage in Northwestern Pennsylvania . - Hemlock Creek, a freestone watershed in northwestern Pennsylvania, has received only minimal perturbation in an area severely impacted by mining. Since aquatic insects have been in- creasingly utilized as a measure of the health and status of freshwater systems, a survey of the water-quality indicative groups (caddisflies, stoneflies, and mayflies -EPT) was initiated in 1993. Collections of adults from seventy UV light-trap samples were made from April to October at 15 sites within the Hemlock Creek watershed. Immatures were also collected during the same period. Standard water chemistry parameters were analyzed concurrently to pro- vide a more complete database for the system. Analyses of samples indicate a diverse fauna of EPT groups is present in the Hemlock Creek system suggesting the drainage is relatively pristine and will serve as a standard for compar- ing other streams in the region.

Experimental Investigation of the Flow through a Sudden Circular Pipe Expansion at low Reynolds Numbers- AX low Reynolds numbers the laminar flow through a sudden 1:3 expansion of a circular pipe is mathematically predicted to be that of a axisymmetric jet emanating from the smaller pipe and expanding slowly in downstream direction inside the larger pipe. With increased Reynolds number transition to unsteady flow via a Hopf- bifurcation is predicted. In this investigation experimen- tal verification using flow visualization is sought. Although the transition from steady laminar flow to unsteady quasi- turbulent flow could be observed the flow is never axisym- metric except at very low Reynolds number which is fol- lowed by a sequence of different steady-flow patterns until transition to unsteady flow occurs. The affects of various experimental parameters have been investigated and found to cause only low order disturbances. The remaining asym- metry of the flow is often aligned with the gravity vector and investigation into the discrepancy between mathematical prediction and experiment is continuing.

Analysis of Land Use and Precipitation as It Relates to Water Quality in Lake Water Control Structures . - For several decades, water quality of both natural and man-made lakes has been a major environmental concern. Numerous studies have suggested that land use patterns and/or storm water runoff are major factors in nutrient loading and bacterial contamination of freshwater lakes. A seven year study of four water control structures at Lake Latonka, a residential development approximately one mile west of Jackson Center, Pa and one half mile north of U.S. route 62 in central Mercer County, determined that the principle source of nutrient (P04 and NH3) and coliform bacterial contamination entering the lake was from agricultural areas within the watershed. There was a general tendency for slight declines in coliform bacteria concen- trations and noticeable declines in the P04, NH3 and suspended solid concentrations at the outflows from these structures. While there was noticeable decline in coliform bacteria, NH3 and suspended sediment concentrations dur- ing the 1991 drought, the P04 concentrations actually increased as the discharge of three of the four water con- trol structures, suggesting that P04 may accumulate in the sediments and be discharged during periods of low precipitation.

The Ecology of Magnetogenic Bacteria and a Study of Nitrate Reduction . - Magnetotactic bacteria are micro- organisms with the unique ability to produce particles of magnetic minerals. Magnetotactic bacteria form the par- ticles intracellular^ and can orient in magnetic fields. Dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRBS) form the mineral extracellularly and gain energy in the process. In this study, samples were collected from field localities near high power lines and transformers. The presence of mag- netotactic bacteria was determined by magnetic enrichment (e.g., "Capillary Racetrack") under light microscopy, and attempts were made to obtain them in culture. DIRB's were detected using ferric gel enrichment medium while ferric citrate and nitrate media were used to try and culture the organisms. While magnetogenic bacteria were evident in all samples, eight strains of only non-magnetogenic bacteria that reduced nitrate and utilized acetate were isolated. The presence of nitrate reductase (NR) in these non-magnetogenic bacteria was confirmed using western blot analysis with antisera to the NR from Pseudomonas stutzeri .

A Light and Electron Microscopic Study of the Male Acces- sory Gland in Artemia (CrustaceœBranchiopoda). - Male accessory glands provide a variety of substances whose roles vary from merely facilitating intromission to adding important constituents for fertilization. Light, phase, Nomarski, fluorescence, and electron microscopy were used to study the accessory glands from thirty Artemia and a variety of histochemical tests were performed to character- ize the secretion. The gland consists of approximately twenty gland cell pairs, with each pair being drained by a</page><page sequence="23">172 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 single neck cell and duct cell. These glandular units are arranged in a cluster with each duct draining into one large central duct which empties through the tip of the eversible penis. Each gland cell contains a crescent-shaped nucleus and many secretory vacuoles. Electron microscopic studies showed that these secretory vacuoles accumulated along the junction of the gland cell pair. Histochemically, the gland- ular secretions are protein-polysaccharide complexes and the cytoplasm stains strongly for RNA corresponding to the stages of secretory activity.

Isolation and Plaque Purification of the Histone H2A Iso-proteins, H2A.X and H2A.Z from a Mouse Lambda Phage Genomic Library . - Histone syn- thesis in cycling cells can be separated into basal synthesis and S-phase synthesis. As basal histones, H2A.X and H2A.Z are synthesized through out the cell cycle at a con- stant rate. In this experiment, the lambda phage that con- tained the basal histone isoproteins H2A.X and H2A.Z has been isolated and purified. Plaque hybridization with 32P labeled probes allowed for accurate screening of the mouse genomic library. Further studies will allow for the isolation and purification of the human histone iso-proteins H2A.lb, H2A.2 from the human genomic library. Restriction analy- sis of both the mouse and human libraries will follow. Burger, Matt and Karen Kurvink, Moravian College, Bethlehem, PA 18018. Variations in the Chromatin of Human Adenocarcinoma Nuclei Observed with FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). - FISH was used to com- pare the nuclei of cells in human adenocarcinoma tissue sections with those of normal controls. Two obvious dif- ferences were observed in the adenocarcinoma cells com- pared to the normal cells: (1) the chromatin of malignant cells was sequestered into clustered regions leaving visible nuclear spaces (termed parachromatin clearing in the can- cer pathology literature) in contrast to the dispersed chrom- atin arrangement typical of normal cells, (2) the nucleolus organizer region (NOR) appeared scattered rather than condensed into a single unit as observed in the controls.

Water Quality Effects of Three Sewage Treatment Plants on the Lacka- wanna River. - From April 1990 to August 1991, water was sampled weekly above and below the Archbald, Throop and Scranton sewage treatment plants (STP) that release treated effluent into the Lackawanna River, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. The measured variables were temp- erature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductance, alkalinity, calcium hardness, total hardness, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphate, fecal coliform and fecal strep. Most variables were unaffected by the presence of the three STPs. The Archbald STP, the smallest and farthest upstream, in- creases the calcium hardness and total hardness of the river water. The Scranton STP, the largest and farthest down- stream, increases the nitrate nitrogen and phosphate load of the river. Surprisingly, the fecal coliform and strep counts are consistently higher above the plants than below. Calderone, Heather*, Anthony Giordano and David L.

Light /Dark and Circadian Changes in En- zyme Expression in Sunflower, Pea, and Soybean Seedlings : - Expression of glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehy- drogenase, and malate dehydrogenase were studied via gel electrophoresis. Seedlings were grown in two different environments; one in light from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and dark from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., and the other in light from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. and dark from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Light/Dark changes were studied by homogenizing plants taken im- mediately from their environment, electrophoresing on agarose and acrylamide gels, and staining for enzyme activity. We found an increase in enzyme activity in plants taken from the dark environment. Circadian changes were studied by allowing both samples to sit in the dark for 24 hours before homogenization. These samples were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Again, we found an in- crease in enzyme activity in plants originally taken from the dark environment before being placed in 24 hrs. of darkness. We conclude that light and circadian rhythms have a definite effect on plant enzyme expression. Capuano, Stephanie and John H.

Microtubules and Cytoplasmic Dynein in Polarized Isolated Skate Hepatocytes : Possible Mediators of Transcytosis. - Skate (Raja erinacea) hepatocytes isolated via collagenase perfusion retain their structural and functional integrity as clusters of polarized cells formed around a single bile canaliculus (Smith et al., 1987. /. Exp. Zool. 241:291-296). Our previous studies have indicated that the microtubule disrupting agent nocodazole inhibits the transcytosis of a fluorescent bile salt in these cells (Miller et al., 1993. The Bulletin MDIBL 32:50-52). This result prompted us to investigate the structural organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. In hepatocytes stained with anti-tubulin, microtubules are concentrated in the pericanalicular region and radiate towards the basolateral surface. Using an anti- cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain antibody, western blots of hepatocyte lysates indicated the expression of this protein, while immunofluorescent localization revealed the presence of punctate cytoplasmic staining. This arrange- ment of microtubules and the presence of cytoplasmic dynein, a minus-end directed microtubule motor protein, would appear to provide the necessary cellular machinery for the mediation of transcytosis.</page><page sequence="24">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 173 Catalone, Bradley, J.* and Richard A.

Oil Droplet Movement During Ooplasmic Segregation in the Medaka Fish Egg (Oryzias latipes). - Ooplasmic oil droplets move toward the vegetal pole (VP) of the fertilized medaka egg during the first cell cycle. The objective of the present study was to determine whether all droplets begin to move toward the VP simultaneously. Using time-lapse video microscopy, we monitored the movement of droplets in eggs oriented with either their animal pole (AP) or their VP up with respect to gravity. In eggs oriented with their AP up, droplets closest to the AP began to move toward the VP pole before other droplets did; while in eggs oriented with their VP up, the time at which droplets began to move toward the VP did not cor- relate with their position in the egg. Our results suggest that two forces act upon oil droplets during ooplasmic segrega- tion in the medaka egg: i) one that actively moves droplets toward the VP, and ii) a buoyant force that causes droplets to float toward the top of the egg.

The Elimination of Bacterial Growth from Fruit Fly Cultures- While culturing fruit flies a bacterial infection of the culture can be catastrophic to an experiment. To control bacterial growth, the proper con- centrations of the correct antibiotics are needed to avoid any adverse effect on fly reproduction and development or quick degradation and hazardous byproducts. We deter- mined that tetracycline and ampicillin eliminated all strains of bacteria present in the cultures, but further investigation is necessary to determine the effects of exposure to these antibiotics. Through experimentation, it was found that a possible link exists between bacterial growth and the quan- tity of water used in producing the medium. Further work is needed to determine if adjusting the water quantity alone can eliminate bacterial growth or if antibiotics are necessary to ensure bacteria-free vials.

SEM Analysis of Sediment and Meiofauna from Stone Harbor ; NJ /Ira?.- The microscopic components of sediment samples from three habitats in the Stone Harbor, New Jersey area were studied. Samples were collected from an ocean beach and bay beach 200 meters apart (both located near 114th Street), as well as from the Wetlands Institute (WI), a salt marsh one mile away. Our goal was to examine meiofaunal diversity and sediment characteristics. Samples were collected 2 cm. below mean low tide surface and were fixed in a 4-6°7o gluteraldehyde solution, seawater buffered. Analysis reveals a mean sand grain diameter of 123 microns, CV = 26.3 °/o (ocean), 108.3 microns, CV = 25.1% (bay), and 116.8 microns, CV = 25.1% (wetlands). Meiofauna observed in 10 ml sediment samples were amphipods, polychaetes, tar- digrades, oligochaetes, tube worms, and turbellarians. Dominant microinvertebrates from ocean samples were amphipods (72/ 100 ml). In the bay, polychaetes (16/ 100 ml) were dominant. WI samples offered the largest count of organisms; turbellarians (500/100 ml) and tardigrades (350/100 ml). Samples contained few diatoms (1-2/100 ml). Bacteria were abundant in bay and wetland samples. Ad- ditional winter/spring sediment samples will be collected and analyzed. Supported in part by an Ursinus College Van Sant Grant.

Identification of Lethal Ty Inser- tions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.- Ty transposition was induced in diploid cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cere- visiae which are heterozygous for resistance to the drugs canavanine and cycloheximide. The Ty element used con- tains a functional HIS3 gene. His + diploid colonies were sporulated and replicated to plates containing both drugs, with and without added histidine, in order to isolate haploids. Only strains with the Ty HIS3 inserted into the genome can survive on medium without histidine. When insertion occurred in a gene essential for growth, there was no growth of His + colonies. Forty-eight possible lethals have been isolated from a total of 2982 analyzed His + col- onies. Isolation of whole chromosomal DNA from the forty-eight strains was accomplished by incorporating those cells into a gelatin block. Clamped Homogeneous Electric Field gel electrophoresis was used to separate whole chrom- osomes. A radioactive HIS3 probe was then employed to determine the location of Ty insertion. Chromosomal loca- tion study is continuing. Coleman, Darrell S* and T.J. Weismann, Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Duquesne University, Pitts- burgh, PA 15282. Physical Chemistry of YBCO Supercon- ductor Adducts. - Ceramic material containing yttrium, barium and oxides of copper have superconducting prop- erties in the region of 100K. This research examines the syn- thesis and characterization of a number of YBCO adducts with ntirogen compounds such as ammonia, pyridine and aniline. All were found to retain their superconducting properties. The critical temperature varies only slightly with the complexing agent. Resistivity vs. temperature curves are displayed for each compound. Resistivity varies consider- ably with each complex. AR vs. T relationship is observed which appears consonant with the structure of the com- plexing agent. Compounds were also studied by thermal analysis methods. These results are displayed. Effects will be discussed relative to the ionization potentials and dielec- tric constants of the ligands.

Use of Cubic Spline Analysis to Monitor the Time Course of Drug Action in Weakly Elec- tric Fish- The effect of local anesthetics on medullary pacemaker nucleus neurons in weakly electric fish was</page><page sequence="25">174 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 examined by cubic spline analysis. These brainstem neurons are responsible for generating the electric organ discharge (EOD). We are interested in the time course and mode of action of these drugs. The EOD was recorded extra- cellularly from freely-swimming fish in a tank containing either a control solution (deionized water) or a local anesthetic (10-4 - 5xl0-5M). The cubic spline passes through every data point and has continuous first and second der- ivatives (slope and curvature) along the entire curve. Spline analysis reveals that the local anesthetics produce a maxi- mal effect on EOD decrement in the first minute follow- ing drug exposure. After 5 minutes of drug exposure the spline value falls by 50-70%. This implies that local anes- thetic binding sites fill rapidly in the first minute and the remaining sites are filled more or less completely by the end of 5 minutes so long as drug is present.

All-Female Hybrids of the Killifishes Fundulus heteroclitus and F. diaphanus . VI. Identical Clones at Widely Separated Localities . - Sixth in a series on the evolutionary biology of an all-female, clonally-reproducing, hybrid fish. The clonal hybrids are currently known from two widely- separated localities in Nova Scotia. Within each locality, scale grafting has indicated that only a single major clone exists. But, because both parental species are abundant at both localities, we expected that the hybrids would form in situ and that the hybrids at the two sites would represent different clones. Scale grafting experiments between hybrids from the two localities, however, indicate that fish from both sites comprise a single clone, with only rare exceptions. Control grafts made from E diaphanus to the hybrids are always rejected, whereas grafts made between hybrids remain healthy. These data are congruent with allozyme data gathered from the same localities. Support provided by an Ursinus College Van Sant Grant. Darr, T.*, Dr. P. Padgett and Dr. R.

Agar Dilution Method as a Standard for Determining Antibiotic Sensitivity. - Antibiotics are widely used to treat bacterial infections. Proper dosages of anti- biotics are determined by sensitivity testing of each organ- ism to the drug. Various commercial systems and manual methods can be used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the isolate. The standard method for sensitivity testing is the agar dilution method. Plates are made with various concentrations of antibiotic incor- porated into the medium. The lowest concentration that completely inhibits growth is interpreted as the MIC. This study uses isolates from 204 intensive care and general patients at Harrisburg Hospital. The isolates have pre- viously been tested by the MicroSccan and BIOMIC methods. The agar dilution method is a standard for com- parison of the two previous methods.

Some Factors Affecting the Germination of Thermoascus Aurantiacus Asco spor es. - Studies were done to determine the cardinal temperatures for germination, as well as the effects of spore concentra- tion and tube culture age on the germination of ascospores from Thermoascus aurantiacus . The minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures for germination were 32.5-35°C, 47.5°C, and 60°C, respectively. Percent ger- mination was not affected either by tube culture age or the spore concentrations used here. Devlin, Laura R* and Jeffrey A.

Cloning of the S-Adenosy methionine Permease Gene of Saccharo- myces cerevisiae. - Because S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cannot passively cross phospholipid-based membranes, it cannot be added exogenously to most living cells in studies addressing its role in cellular metabolism. This problem has not hindered research in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as it encodes a high affinity permease that rapidly imports SAM. Once in the cell, radio-labeled SAM is rapidly directed into vacuoles or SAM-mediated activities, includ- ing its conversion to methionine through a recycling path- way. To clone the SAM permease gene, plasmids from a chromosomal library ere electroporated into yeast of a strain auxotrophic for methionine and unable to import SAM. The cells were then incubated in media supplemented with SAM to satisfy their methionine requirement. Cells from five resulting colonies imported exogenously supplied SAM and could not grow in the absence of either SAM or methionine. They are now being tested for the presence of plasmids encoding the SAM permease gene.

A Continuing Study of Inorganic Water Quality of the Brodhead Creek, Monroe County, Pennsylvania- The study was conducted to assess changes in inorganic water quality of the Brod- head Creek in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. During the summers of 1989, 1990, and 1993, samples were collected for two weeks daily, and analyzed for chemical parameters including specific conductance, hardness, pH, total alka- linity, fluoride, ammonium-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, and phosphate-phosphorus. These parameters were chosen in order to determine possible deterioration in water quality due to discharge of sewage effluent, acid precipitation, and agricultural runoff. Daily mean values for each site are tabulated along with correlation analyses. Using the yearly mean values for all sites, water quality fluctuations were determined. Although data indicate that the water quality is satisfac- tory in the study area, there is evidence of change in the nutrient load as shown by a significant percent increase in the tested chemical parameters.</page><page sequence="26">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 175 DiMuccio, Dawn M.* and Larry P.

Microbial Contamina- tion of the RICOR 6000 Diesel Filter . - Microbial con- tamination of Diesel fuel leads to corrosion and opera- tional problems of filters, engines and tanks. Previous studies have discovered numerous fungal and bacterial species growing in a wide variety of filters and Diesel storage systems. This research will investigate the RICOR 6000 Diesel filter from a 45 foot Troller boat. This filter has not yet been analyzed for contaminants. Procedures were isolation of the microbes growing on the filter by using aseptic technique to gather and grow them on a variety of media; testing for species with the use of various staining methods, Enterotube, Gaspack and a variety of other microbiological techniques. Another method was to develop a simple Diesel filtering system which ensured an environment for proper microbial growth. The identification of these organisms may suggest effec- tive solutions to their obstruction in filters. Further research may lead to an environmentally safe process for suppres- sion of these organisms. Donn, Roger, M.*, Pamela S. Botts and Larry R.

Accurate Dating, Heavy Metal Concen- tration and Mutagenic Activity of Young Ponds on Gull Point. - Concentrations of heavy metals and mutagens are increasing in aquatic ecosystems due to continued release of toxic compounds into the environment. This study ex- amined the correlation between toxin concentration and pond age. Gull Point, at the terminus of Presque Isle State Park, Erie, Pennsylvania, is an area of continuous pond formation by lacustrine shore processes behind a recurv- ed sand spit. Time of pond formation was determined by examining a series of aerial photographs taken from 1946 to present and noting the year of the photograph in which the pond first appeared. Ponds were ground truthed and pelagic and benthic samples were taken. The benthic samples were acid digested, and metal content was deter- mined by atomic emission spectrometery. The concentra- tion of metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, pB, and Zn) increased with pond age. The pelagic sample was examined using the Ames Salmonella test to determine the level of mutagenicity.

Comparison of the Habitat Prefer- ences of Gray and Fox Squirrels in Northwestern Penn- sylvania- Three woodlots in Crawford, Forest and Warren Counties of Pennsylvania were monitored for squirrel activ- ity over a four month period to determine if the black and gray phase of the gray squirel (Sciurus carolinensis ) and the fox squirrel (5. niger) exhibit habitat preferences. Based on 65 hours of observations, the two color phases of the gray squirrel displayed a definite habitat preference with the black preferring the darker regions of the forest. The sec- tions of the woodlot dominated by hemlock ( Tsuga cana- densis) and beech (Fagus grandif olia) had the highest con- centration of the black phase. While the gray phase and fox squirrels preferred more open woodlots.

Are Crop and Weed Interactions Effected by Mycorrhizae?- This project is the first of a series of experiments investigating whether mycorrhizal interactions affect the outcome of competition between soybean and weeds. Mixtures of soybean and weeds were grown in soil inocu- lated with the mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus intraradices, or inoculated with a sterile (control) inoculum. Also, weeds and soybean were grown separately without interspecific competitors. The weeds used in the study were Johnson- grass, pigweed, velvetleaf, lambsquarters, mustard, and ragweed. After ten weeks in the greenhouse the roots and shoots were harvested. Fresh and dry weights were obtained and sub-samples of roots were stained for mycorrhizae. Results show that soybean and velvetleaf are stimulated by mycorrhizal interactions. Pigweed was unaffected by inoculation. The Johnsongrass was inhibited by the viable inoculant. In most pots where soybean and weed species were grown together, the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil changed the competitive outcome so that the soy- bean was the winner.

Role of the Thyroid Gland in the Infertility of Vitamin D Deficiency- The long term goals of this project are to determine sites and mechanisms of action of vitamin D in male reproductive tissues, since vitamin D deficiency leads to reversible infer- tility in male rats. We are trying to determine if the infer- tility of vitamin D deficiency is an androgen dependent process or if fertility is indirectly affected by perturbation of the thyroid gland during vitamin D deficiency. Morph- ologically, the thyroid gland and spermatogenic tissues appear inactive in vitamin D deficiency. We are determin- ing plasma levels of androgens [testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] and thyroxin (T4) and examin- ing reproductive tissue of vitamin D-deficient animals, vitamin D-deficient animals implanted with T or T4 pellets, and vitamin D-replete controls. Analyses indicate perturba- tions in daily sperm production, epididymal sperm reserves, sperm morphology, and histometric indices of thyroid follicular, seminiferous, and epididymal epithelia.

Lehigh River Fish Ladders . - In the 1830's, the Lehigh River shad fishery ended with the construction of canal dams, which blocked the American shaďs upstream migration to spawn.

The ladders, designed by DER's Bureau of Flood Protec- tion Projects, are reinforced concrete structures consisting of a series of 10-foot by 10- foot chambers with vertical slot openings between them. This creates a series of chutes and pools through which the shad can migrate upstream past each dam. The fish ladders, in addition to an existing one con- structed by the Commonwealth in 1984 at a dam in Allen- town, will allow an estimated 225,000 shad per year to pass the dams.

Comparison of the Morphological Char- acteristics of the Byssi of the Quagga Mussel With Repre- sentative Byssate Mussels of Three Genera.- To better understand the taxonomie identity of the Quagga mussel, the second nonindigenous byssate mussel species found in the Great Lakes, the surface features of the stem, threads, and plaques were examined with a scanning electron micro- scope. The external morphology of the byssi of the quagga mussel was compared and contrasted to representative byssate mussels of three genera; Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel), Mytilopsis leucophaeta (dark false mussel), and Mytilus edulis (blue mussel). The attachment of threads to the stem in the quagga mussel is unlike those of the other three mussel genera examined. This information indicates that the byssi of the quagga mussel is distinct from the other byssate mussels examined. These morphological differences in thread branching may be related to differ- ences in the mechanics of byssus formation. Thus, pro- viding evidence to support the presence of a second distinct byssate species in the Great Lakes. Elliott, Mary M. and Dr. Janice Knepper, Villanova Univ- ersity, Villanova, PA 19085. Direct Detection of MMTV Proviral DNA in Mammary Glands of BALB/cV Mice . - Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) is transferred exogenously in the milk of lactating female BALB/cV mice to nursing pups. Uptake of exogenous MMTV occurs via the gut. The first target of infection has been shown to be B lymphocytes. We have used in situ polymerase chain reac- tion (PCR) for the direct detection of exogenous MMTV in BALB/cV mammary glands. In this procedure primers specific for the long terminal repeat (LTR) of exogenous MMTV have been used to selectively amplify BALB/cV proviral DNA sequences in paraffin sections. Hybridiza- tion of a biotinylated probe with amplified exogenous proviral sequences in situ is followed by treatment with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Thus, in situ PCR allows the visual determination of the presence of new proviral DNA in tissues. Our results indicate that exogenous MMTV is transferred to the mammary glands of female BALB/cV mice as early as twelve days after birth.

Effects of Consumption of Hot Pep- pers on Salivary Antibody Production- C apsaicin, the pungent ingredient of hot peppers, has been found to af- fect the concentration of beta-endorphin in the hypothal- amus and also to promote the release of Substance P from afferent C fibers. Both of these chemicals are known to be immunomodulators; therefore, it is not unreasonable to expect that eating hot peppers will have an effect on im- mune function. However, the experimenters researching the immunological effects of capsaicin have not attempted to approximate normal human consumptionof hot peppers. The results of our pilot study suggest a possible difference in production of salivary IgA in response to eating hot pep- pers between those who regularly consume them and those who do not.

Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals by Bryophytes in Streams Affected by Acid Mine Drainage. - Bioaccumu- lation of four heavy metals, (Al, Fe, Zn, and Mn), by bryophytes was monitored in several streams that received acid mine drainage. Fe and Al accumulated in bryophyte tissues in much higher concentrations than did Mn and Zn. The highest Al concentrations in bryophytes were found in water with a pH near 5.0. At other pH's, bryophytes contained lower Al concentrations. Fe accumulation was greatest in the most acidic site. The lowest concentrations of Fe and Al occured in bryophytes at a circumneutral site. Bryophytes transplanted from a circumneutral to an acidic site accumulted significant amounts of Fe and Al within 2-4 weeks, while transplants from acid sites to a circum- neutral site lost a significant amount of Fe and Al after 2-4 weeks. Zn concentrations in tissues showed no apprecia- tion variation among sample sites whereas Mn concentra- tions in tissues were found to be lower at more acidic sites.

Effects of Fruit Removal on Male Function of Curcurbita pepo- We studied the effects of fruit/seed pro- duction on male funciton, including total male flowers, mean pollen number per flower, mean pollen size, and pollen performance in the common zucchini, Cucurbita pepo. In the summer of 1992, 30 plants of the Black Beauty cultivar (green ovary) and 30 Burpee Golden cultivar (yellow ovary) were grown under two treatment conditions. On 15 of each cultivar, every pistillate flower was removed on the day of anthesis throughout the growing season (No Fruit treatment). The remaining 15 plants of each cultivar were permitted to flower and set fruit (control treatment). Equal pollen loads of No Fruit and control treatments with different genetic markers were used to pollinate Black Beauty recipients. These fruit were harvested, the seeds removed. In the summer of 1993, 75 seeds from each fruit were planted and screened for parentage (fruit color). We found that seed production adversely affects male function.</page><page sequence="28">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 177 Fanella, Rick* Jeffrey B.

The Effects of Nitrogen Enrichment on the Phytoplankton Community Composition of an Acid Sensitive Lake. - We studied the response of the phytoplankton community composition to nitrogen enrichment in Faylor Lake, an acid stressed lake in Union County, Pennsylvania for seven weeks in September and October. We used 9 (3 control, 6 experimental) secured floating plastic bags filled with 50 L of lake water. The 6 experimental bags were enriched with nitrate (3 at lOx normal lake concentration, 3 at lOOOx). Water chemistry of the bags was monitored in con- junction with organismal counts. There was no uniform response by the phytoplankton community; Cosmarium tenue increased in highly enriched conditions (lOOOx) sug- gesting the species is nitrogen limited. Ankistrodesmus declined in highly enriched conditions, and Peridinium species remained unchanged.

Computer-Assisted Analysis of a Stable Neural Network. - Gymnotiform electric fish native to Central and South America (transparent knife - Eigenmannia virescens) generate an electric organ discharge (EOD) which is quasi- sinusoidal and very time stable. A network of 80-100 neurons termed the medullary pacemaker nucleus is responsible for generating the EOD. IF the fish's tempera- ture is held constant, the EOD frequency does not vary. The EOD was recorded extra-cellularly from freely-swimming fish confined to a plexiglass tube with open ends covered with cloth mesh. We utilized data acquisition and analysis equipment (RC Electronics, Santa Barbara, CA) to quan- titatively study this network stability. Interspike interval (ISI) histogram analysis was performed utilizing 5 usee, bin widths. Fish were reared at 28C. and analyzed at tempera- tures ranging from 22-35C. At each temperature studied, all ISIs collected fell into a single 5 microsecond bin. There- fore the EOD frequencey (300-500 Hz in Eigenmannia) exhibits less than 5 usee, jitter. The network is not more stable at the rearing temperature than other environmen- tal temperatures. Supported in part by Howard Hughes Medical Institute summer grant. Flynn, Deirdre* and Mary E.

Passive Fluid Transport as a Mechanism for Brain Growth in the Chick Embryo. - The early chick embryonic brain expands in response to cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSF). As a consequence, the brain is a fluid filled hollow. This study tested the hypoth- esis that fluid crosses the neuroepithelium by means of passive transport. Studies are in progress to determine pro- tein concentration and composition of both blood plasma and CSF during key stages of brain expansion. Based on similar studies of the eye, it is expected that the proteins will be the same for both fluids, but that the percent of proteins in the CSF may change. We have determined that the con- centrations of both the plasma and CSF proteins peaked at stage 18, and had dropped by stage 24. Electrophoresis is being done to compare protein composition, and radioactive tracer studies are in progress to show the rate of transfer of labeled proteins from the blood plasma to the CSF.

Functional Sub- divisions of Chemosensory Systems in Several Species of Salamanders . - Main olfactory and vomeronasal receptor cells are morphologically indistinguishable under light microscopy. Cell surface antigens, however, have been shown to vary among neurons. We examined the distribu- tion of olfactory and vomeronasal receptor cells that ex- press soybean agglutinin-binding components. Previous SBA studies of the aquatic frog Xenopus suggested that receptors responding to water-borne odors are SBA positive while receptors responsive to air-borne odors are SBA nega- tive. We performed SBA immunocytochemistry on six species of aquatic and terrestrial salamanders. Olfactory and vomeronasal axons and terminals of aquatic sala- manders were labelled. Only vomeronasal axons and termi- nals of terrestrial salamanders were labelled. No label was found in newts at any life history stage. In general, SBA binding can be used to distinguish two classes of chemical receptor cells. These results support the hypothesis that vomeronasal receptors detect water-borne odors.

Analysis of the Woody Vegetation of the Reimert Bird Sanctuary.- Woody vegetation was studied at the Reimert Memorial Bird Haven - a 4.04 ha preserve located in Lower Macungie Township, Pa. and owned by the Wildlands Conservancy. The study was conducted to assemble baseline data for future research in order to pro- mote the site's secondary function as an environmental education center. Trees greater than 2cm dbh were evaluated on ten ran- domly selected 100m2 sites throughout the sanctuary. Within each of the ten sites 16m2 quadrats were randomly marked off and the woody shrubs species were identified and tallied. Analysis determined that the vegetation of the Reimert Sanctuary is somewhat diverse. The dominant tree species were mixed oaks (Black, Red and Scarlet), Sweet Birch and Tulip Poplar. While the Tulip Tree is the most valuable species on the property, the mixed oaks are providing a majority of the cover. The understory is comprised pre- dominantly of Spicebush and Red-Panicled Dogwood. Garcia, E.*, R. Poth, R. McPherson, and D.

Hepatic Estrogen Receptor in Largemouth Bass , Micropterus salmoides: Partial Characterization. - In non-mammalian vertebrates, hepatic vitellogenesis is an estrogen dependent process. It is presumed that estrogen induction of vitellogenin synthesis is mediated a hepatic estrogen receptor. In this study we report some of the characteristics of a hepatic estrogen receptor in largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides . Receptor binding studies found that specific binding was saturable and Scrathcard analysis resulted in a mean Kd of 5.9 nM in cytosol and 3.7 nM in nuclear salt extracts. Binding was steroid specific, binding estrogens, but not androgens or progestins. Addi- tionally, spawning females were found to have lower hepatic estrogen-binding capacity than post-spawning females.

Edges of Woody Plant Communities in Lancaster County ; Pennsylvania. - Small woodlots char- acterize the woody plant communities of southeastern Pennsylvania and the larger wooded regions are traversed by roadways. These woody plant communities are rather fragmented and have considerable edge components. In an effort to characterize the edges of woody plant communi- ties, we studied the boundaries between woody plant com- munities and agricultural fields, highways, rivers &amp; streams, lakes, power lines, and rail roadways. The interior of these woody plant communities was assessed using the point quarter method and the gradients of vegetation at the edges were evaluated using transects normal to the edges. While some species can be characterized as eckophiles , the in- fluence of the adjacent community and the history of edge development are important factors.

Do Pollen Tubes of Cucurbita pepo Interfere With One Another?- This study was designed to determine if interference competition occurs among pollen tubes growing through the styles of the flowers of Cucurbita pepo (common zucchini). In the summer of 1993, 65 Black Beauty Bush (BBB) cultivar and 15 Golden Yellow (GY) cultivar were field grown. Fifteen of the BBB and all of the CY plants were designated as pollen donors. Fifty of the BBB were used as recipients for controlled pollinations. Five controlled pollination treatments were used in which we varied the ratio of BBB pollen to GY pollen in the mix- ture deposited onto the recipient flowers. The mature fruits were harvested and seeds were counted. An analysis of variance showed no differences in pollen viability and that the total seed number per fruit decreased as the relative amount of GY pollen in the mixture exceeded the amount of BBB pollen. This suggests that pollen tubes experience interference. Gauriloff, Dr. Larry P.* and Patricia R. Flanagan, Mercy- hurst College, Erie, Pennsylvania 16546. Identification and Distribution of Fungi on Presque Isle State Park- A survey of the species of Fungi on Presque Isle State Park (Erie, PA) was begun in 1988 and is over 75% complete. All basidio- mycetous and ascomycetous specimens encountered were identified to species and their numbers and distribution determined. Over 200 different species have been docu- mented. This biodiversity inventory of the park's inhabitats will be enhanced by the completion of a survey of the aquatic fungi in the naturally occurring water systems within the park. Data can be used to rapidly determine the impact of environmental changes in the park's habitats by noting significant and immediate changes in the fungal diversity in that area, i.e. construction of a visitors facility caused the loss Morchella angustaceps from the park. On the other hand, the diminishing number and occurrence of Armil- lariella mellea during the past three years may be indicative of a more subtle change occurring in the park's habitats.

Genetic Analysis of the Aspergillus nidulans mutant bimF. - Understanding the regulation of genes needed to complete the normal cell cycle is crucial to cancer research. Aspergillus nidulans is an excellent organism to study cell cycle because it has powerful molec- ular genetics. Many temperature sensitive cell cycle mutants have been isolated from Aspergillus which become Blocked in Mitosis such as bimF. The purpose of this study is to obtain a genomic clone containing the wild type bimF gene as a tool to characterize its role in mitosis. BimF is a tem- perature sensitive recessive mutation that maps to linkage group II. A linkage group II specific genomic library has been obtained. Transformations with a wild type genomic library will identify the clone containing bimF which rescues the phenotype. It is important to identify the bmiF mutation in order to determine its function in regulating the cell cycle. Grebski, Dr. Wiesław, The Pennsylvania State University, Hazleton, PA 18201. Computer Aided Design of Long, Short , and Intermediate Columns.- The designing of columns and posts is a very common engineering problem. However, in many mechanical engineering technology pro- grams, those topics are underemphasized and many stu- dents or graduates do not feel comfortable with those topics. The problems are even bigger in the designing of intermediate columns where Euler's equations cannot be applied. Many students are also having a problem with col- umns exposed to an eccentric load. The author of this presentation has developed a computer aided method to be used for educational and industrial applications. The software can be used in the designing process of conven- tional and eccentric loaded columns. In relation to long columns, the program uses Euler's criteria. In relation to</page><page sequence="30">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 179 short and intermediate columns, the program uses three different methods: • Method developed by The American Institute of Steel Construction • British design standards • German design standards This software has been used by the author as a teaching sup- plement in teaching a machine design course in a Mech- anical Engineering Technology Program. By using this soft- ware, the students have gained a better understanding of the topics. Griser, Susan* and C Allan Miller.

Olfaction and Social Status in the Discrimination of Female Dominance by Male Mong- olian Gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus.- Trivers' parental investment theory predicts that both sexes in a monoga- mous mating system should exhibit mate choice. Previous studies have shown that females chose a dominant males odor when allowed a choice between the odorant of domi- nant and subordinate males (Berg and Miller, 1991). A choice test with a Y-maze olfactometer was used to deter- mine the possible olfactory discrimination of female social status by males. When males had prior social experience with females, males had a significant preference for the odor of subordinate females. Even when the males had no prior social experience with the females, they still had a significant preference for subordinate female odor. These apparent contradictory findings are discussed in relation to parental investment theory. Haase, Judith A.* and Bernard Fried, Department of Biology, Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042. Chromosomal Analysis of Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda) and E. trivolvis . - A comparative study was made on the chromosome number and karyotypes of Echinostoma caproni and E. trivolvis, two allopatric spe- cies of 37-collar-spined echinostomes. Somatic chromo- somes from redial stages and meiotic chromosomes from the testes of adult worms of both species were studied by light microscopy. Tissues were treated in 0.01% colchicine, fixed and macerated in 3:1 methanokacetic acid, and stained in Giemsa pH 6.8. A meiotic chromosome number of 11 was determined for E. caproni . Meiotic chromosomes were not found in is. trivolvis . The somatic chromosome number from redial tissues of both echinostome species was 22. Studies on the karyotypes of both species are in progress.

Caching Responses of Gray Squirrels: A Test of the Perishability and Handling-time Hypotheses . - Currently, there exists con- siderable controversy over the relative effects of seed perishability and handling time on the caching behavior of seed-hoarding animals. This study was designed to deter- mine the relative influence of these factors on foraging and caching decision, by examining the response of gray squir- rels (Sciurus carolinensis ) to food items that vary in both handling time and perishability. To do this, we presented squirrels with acorns from two oak subgenera (subgenus Erythrobalanus and subgenus Leucobalanus) that vary in either perishability (due to germination schedules) or handling time (due to acorn size). Six types of preference trials were conducted with 20-25 free-ranging gray squirrels. In each trial, individual squirrels were presented sequen- tially with two acorn types, so that paired treatments varied in handling time and/or perishability. Caching responses were recorded for each acorn, along with the eating and caching times and dispersal distances. Analyses to date indicate that squirrels consume acorns of high perishability and cache acorns of low perishability, without regard for handling time. These results suggest that the perishability of seeds holds greater influence over the decision to cache than any other single factor.

Effect of Neonatal Dex- amethasone on Adult Responsiveness to Glucocorticoids: Body Weight, Eating Behavior and Metabolic Efficiency. - The enduring effects of early life treatment with the syn- thetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone on adult body weight gains, eating behavior, and metabolic efficiency were ex- amined. On days 2, 4, 6, and 8 postpartum Sprague-Dawley male rats were injected with either dexamethasone (2.72 ug/pup) or vehicle (0.05 ml sesame seed oil), or were not injected at all. At age 44 days all animals were adrenalecto- mized, then implanted s.c. with pellets containing 0, 30, 175, or 750 ug dexamethasone. Twenty-four hour measures of food intake, weight gains, and saline intake were carried out across days 46-47, 51-52, and 56-57 postpartum. Results showed that neonatal administration of dexamethasone dampened the effect of later exposure to dexamethasone on metabolic efficiency. Findings are discussed in terms of potential mechanisms mediating this effect. Hall, John S.*, Richard G. Heller and Franklin T. Herbst, Department of Biology, Albright College, Reading, PA. Characteristics of a Woodrat Population as Determined by Radiotelemetry and Infrared Video . - A small population of the Allegheny Woodrat at a cave site in West Virginia has been studied from July 1992 to date. Five individual wood- rats have been monitored by radiotelemetry: two adult males; an adult female and her two female offspring. One nest area has been observed by remote infrared video for extended periods of time. Information has been obtained on foraging ranges, food storage, territorial interactions, behavior of juveniles and activity patterns.

The Control of Proteoglycan Biosynthesis by Estrogens in the Immature Rat Uterus . -</page><page sequence="31">180 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 The uterine growth response in the immature rat serves as a good model for observing the effects of steroid hormones on cellular growth. This report will summarize the effects of estrogen on proteoglycan biosynthesis, wet weights and protein content. Uteri from 21-day old ovariectomized rats were studied 24 hours following an estradiol injection. 3H- Glucosamine was incubated with isolated uteri in Hela media to mesure proteoglycan biosynthesis. The Lowry protein assay was used to measure protein content. In estradiol dose-response experiments, changes in proteo- glycan biosynthesis increased in a dose-related fashion. The maximum responses were seen at 4 and 40 ug/kg doses of estradiol. Similar dose-response changes in wet weights and protein levels were seen. In a study using estriol, increases in proteoglycan biosynthesis were also seen. These results demonstrate that estrogen regulates proteoglycan biosyn- thesis in the immature rat uterus.

Lithium Induces the Expression of the Skeleto- genic Potential of Secondary Mesenchyme Cells in the Sea Urchin. - Lytechinus pictus embryos exhibited an increased number of PMCs when cultured with LiCl. Li-treated em- bryos contained an averge of 52.2 ( + /-7.9) compared to 36 ( + /-6.9) in normal embryos. A population of secondary mesechyme cells (SMCs) has been shown to be capable of converting into skeletogenic cells when PMCs are removed from the embryo. To determine if the extra PMC-like cells present in the Li-treated embryos were converted SMCs, Li- treated and control embryos were dissociated at the mesen- chyme blastula stage and aliquots of the cell suspension were stained with mA6elO. Normal embryos contained 6.0% positive cells, compared to 11.4% in Li-treated em- bryos. PMCs were removed from both suspensions by pan- ning on WGA-coated Petri dishes, reducing the level of positive cells to 0.2%, and the depleted suspensions were cultured in sea water. Following SMC conversion, control cultures contained 5.8% immunopositive cells, while Li- treated cultures contained only 1.5%. This greatly reduced level of cell conversion'' suggests that lithium may induce the respecification of cell fate in SMC precursors. This work was partially funded by a grant from the Penn- sylvania Academy of Science . Heffner, Wendy*, Sandra Anderson and Barbara N.

Avifauna and Woody Vegetation in Urban Forest Islands. - Woody vegetation and avifauna are among the parameters being monitored in a variety of urban forest islands as part of a longterm study of the effects of frag- mentation on biodiversity. Two of the islands are of approx- imately the same area and are similarly edge-dominated. Importance values indicate that the two areas are different with respect to woody vegetation. One site is dominated by the invasion of the alien Norway maple, while the other is a mixed oak forest with little invasion by the Norway maple. The breeding bird populations show many similarities. Neotropical migrants that inhabit forest interiors are not present in either fragment. Neotropical migrants character- istic of interior/edge found in both areas are similar in presence but not abundance. Heil, Laurie, C.*, William B.

East Versus West : A Com- parison of the Cypris Larvae of Octolasmis cor and Octo- lasmis mülleri.-The life cycle of barnacles includes six free-swimming naupliar stages, the cypris stage, and the sessile adult. Adult barnacles of the lepadomorph genus Octolasmis typically are epizoic on various marine animal species. The two barnacles studied, Octolasmis cor (Aurivillius, 1892) and Octolasmis mùlleri (Coker, 1902) are found attached to the gills of crabs, namely Scylla serrata (Forskál, 1755) and Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896). The size and Morphology of these two species of barnacle cyprid larvae are compared by the use of light and scanning electron microscopy. The larvae were fixed and prepared for scanning electron microscopy according to the protocol developed by Felgenhauer (1987). It was found that there is a significant size difference between the cyprids of the two species, and that the cyprid carapace of each species has distinctive surface characteristics. It is possible that these differences reflect the differing habitats of the barnacles.

Visual System Adaptations in Two Genera of Cave Crickets. - Cave crickets of the genera Euhadenoecus and Ceuthophilus are common in the caves of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The compound eyes of these crickets were studied and compared to typical terrestrial insect eyes using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Eyes of both Euhadenoecus fragilis and Ceuthophilus brevipes have fused rhabdom, apposition compound eyes. Subrhab- domeric vesicles are observed in the dark adapted state. Facet number is substantially reduced (typically 50-70 microns) and uniform over the surface of the eye, compared to typical terrestrial insects.

Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Cognitive Functioning in College Students. - Cognitive deficits due to long term excessive alcohol consumption are well-documented. Cognitive impairments in non-dependent drinkers have been more difficult to document. This may be due to a true lack of impairment in this drinking popula- tion, or it may result from a lack of sensitivity in the tests used to access cognitive functioning. The present study ex- amined the latter possibility, employing gender-sensitive tests in conjunction with a drinking history questionnaire.</page><page sequence="32">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 181 The rationale for using gender-sensitive cognitive tests was based on the sensitivity of these tests to endocrine status, and the ability of ethanol to disrupt endocrine status in healthy male and female adults. Ninety-seven female and seventy-eight male college students were tested. Results were subjected to regression analysis separately for each sex. Findings will be discussed in terms of the impact of drink- ing history on cognitive performance in a largely non- alcohol dependent population.

Effects of Mycorrhizae on Competition Between Soybeans and Weeds.- This study was undertaken to determine mycor- rhizal effects on competition between soybeans and weed species. Treatments included five infected ( Glomus inter- radices) and five non-infected (sterile inoculum) repetitions of the following competitive situations: none, below ground, above ground, and both above/below ground. Treatments included intraspecific competition among soy- beans and interspecific competition between soybean and the following weeds: velvetleaf, red root pigweed, and Johnson grass. At harvest, fresh and dry shoot weights and dry root weights were obtained. In intraspecific competition, mycorrhizae enhanced soy- bean growth greatest in below ground competition; however, the largest plants were observed in above/below ground competition. Interspecific results show that mychorrhizae improved soybean growth in seven of nine competition situations while reducing weed growth in six of nine situations. In above/below ground competition, mycorrhizae always improved soybean growth and restricted weed growth. In conclusion, inoculated soybeans competed better than equivalent non-mycorrhizal treatments. Huffman, J.E. and R.

The Effects of Piperazine Treatment in Raccoons Infected with Baylisascaris Procyonis.- Twenty-three rac- coons ranging in age from 3 to 5 weeks were submitted to the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in the spring of 1993. Fecal samples were checked weekly for the presence of parasite eggs. Eleven of the 23 animals were positive for Baylisascaris eggs by four months post admission. The animals were divided into an untreated and treated group. Raccoons treated with 400 mg of piperazine were negative for eggs for 3 weeks with eggs again being released. A worm burden was evaluated in untreated versus treated groups. Field studies utilizing piperazine laced baits to reduce Baylisascaris infection in raccoons was also evaluated.

Separation , Purification and Quantification of the Gypsy Moth Fungus , Entomophaga maimaiga, from Gypsy Moth , Lymantria dispar.- The gypsy moth, Ly man- iría dispar ; is one of the most devastating insects to many and varied forest tree species in PA. Control is difficult because of the fecundant nature of this lepidopteran spe- cies. Chemical controls are effective, but are not environ- mentally acceptable; therefore, biological controls are be- ing sought. In 1989, a fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga , was found to be the cause of an epizootic in several north- eastern states. This fungus is continuing to decimate gypsy moth (GM) populations in PA and elsewhere. However, the infective fungal propagules (resting spores) necessary for the primary infection of GM larvae £lo not develop in culture. Consequently, a procedure is necessary to separate, quantify and purify these propagules apart from the GM cadavers where they readily form. Using standard, albeit modified, microbiological procedures (wet sieving, centri- fugation, millipore filtration and surface sterilization), we have been able to separate, quantify and destroy all other associated organisms. These resting spores are now being used in laboratory and field studies under controlled condi- tions to ascertain their significance as a biological control agent against the GM in PA and Ohio. This research is a co- operative undertaking of California University of PA, the PA Bureay of Forestry and the United States Forest Service. Izer, Bronwyn M. and Marilyn L.G.

Performance of Selected Herbaceous Plants in a 1993 Annual Plant Trial . - Field testing of annuals, bien- nials and non-hardy herbaceous plants is beneficial to ascertain the qualities of newly introduced cultivars as well as to assure the value of older, established species. Ninety different herbaceous plants were grown as annuals in a plant trial modeled after the Penn State Plant Trials. Evalu- ation occurred over a 14 week period during one growing season. The performance of these plants was analyzed according to plant vigor, floriferousness, uniformity of growth, uniformity of floriferousness, tolerance to disease and pests, foliage, fragrance, and novelty of the plant. A rating system was developed to assess these eight plant characteristics. Eighty of the ninety varieties tested could be considered viable plants to be grown in central Pennsyl- vania and should be promoted in the commercial trade.

Variation of Pollen Tube Growth In-vitro-Curcurbita pepo, C. texana, Fl-hybrids and F2-hybrids were used to investigate varia- tion in pollen tube growth in-vitro. Pollen was collected from field grown plants and germinated on nutrient agar for one hour. Pollen tube growth was measured with an im- age analysis system. Curcurbita pepo pollen tubes grew sig- nificantly longer than C. texana pollen tubes but the vari- ance was small and similar in the two species. Pollen tubes</page><page sequence="33">182 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 from Fl and F2-hybrids grew significantly longer and had greater variance than either parental type. Fl-hybrids showed greater variance within individuals, but F2-hybrids showed greater variances between individuals compared to the parental types. These differences in variance in the F2's was expected because of independent assortment of genes that control pollen tube growth. This study indicates that early pollen tube growth is more of a sporophytic than gametophytic trait. Kail, Brian W. and T.J.

Atomic Absorption Studies of Mercury in Pennsylvania Rivers and Lakes . - Inorganic as well as total organic bound mercury in sediments from selected Pennsylvania lakes and streams was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy following the method of Hatch &amp; Ott. Sampling locations included: Pymatuning Lake and Reservoir, Crawford County; Lake Arthur, Butler County; Beaver Reservoir, Westmoreland County; Cross Creek, Washington County; and the Smeth- port area of Center County. Selected sites along the Alle- gheny River from the confluence at Pittsburgh to East Brady and side tributaries were also studied. Values ranged from 6 to 45 ppb. for inorganic mercury. Sources of mer- cury are considered in interpreting the values obtained near industrial towns. The effects of past mill activity on other industrial activity is addressed. Organic mercury was found to be considerably higher. Values range around 80 ppb. and are consistent with those reported by McNeal &amp; Rose of Penn State University. A Perkin-Elmer MAS 50 Mercury Analyzer was used. Results by other analytical methods are also compared. Keane, Shannon M.* and Jack D.

A Deter- mination of Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Concen- tration in Escherichia coli During Diauxic Growth. - Research on the phenomena of catabolite repression and inducer exclusion in Escherichia coli has resulted in a model postulating that when glucose is being transported into cells, adenylyl cyclase and lactose permease are inactive, and when glucose is not being transported, these enzymes are active. The purpose of this study was to test the model's predictions that (1) intracellular cAMP concentrations should be higher during growth on lactose than during growth on glucose, and (2) that lactose is not transported during growth on glucose. Preliminary data indicates that cAMP concentrations in E. coli during growth on glucose are higher than during growth on lactose, and that lactose is not transported during growth on glucose. These findings support the theory of inducer exclusion but do not support the concept that glucose transport inhibits adenylyl cyclase. Keating, SP, K.M. Clements, D. Ostrowski and T.

The Effects of Acid Mine Drainage on Fecal Bacteria from Raw Sewage . - Studies conducted in a Cambria County acid mine drainage stream suggest that mine drainage rapidly reduces populations of fecal bacteria associated with inputs of raw sewage. Most probable num- bers (MPN) and membrane filter techniques were used to estimate bacterial populations in the stream above the sewage and mine drainage outfalls, below the sewage out- fall and after acid mine drainage entered the sewage- contaminated stream. Changes in populations were cor- related with changes in pH and sulfate, iron and manganese concentrations associated with inputs of the various pollutants. Individual, identified enteric isolates were tested for tolerance to acid mine drainage by exposing populations of the isolates to filtered drainage. While all isolate popu- lations were reduced, some isolates were significantly less affected than others. Thus, while mine drainage may act as a generally effective disinfectant, it may be much less effective at reducing populations of particular strains of disease-causing intestinal microbes.

Biotic and Physical Comparisons Between Two Small Lakes on Sandstone and Limestone Substrates.- We compared the species composition of Faylor Lake, a lake on a sandstone substrate with low ANC (Acid Neutralizing Capacity), and Pardee Lake, a lake on limestone substrate exhibiting high ANC, both located in Union County, Pennsylvania. Over a period of seven weeks from September to October whole water samples, net plankton, and water chemistry data were taken; in addition, the physical parameters of the lakes were examined. The differences between Faylor Lake and Pardee Lake in ANC was 100 to near 2000 ueq/L, respectively. Available nitrogen, phosphorous, and silica remained low over the study period in both lakes. Blooms of dinoflagellates and desmids occurred in Faylor while Pardee exhibited euglen- oid and diatom blooms. In addition, zooplankton com- munities also differed; Copepods dominated in Faylor and Cladocerans in Pardee. Kintz, Janet* and A.C Allen, Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA 19422. The Effects of Controlled Light and Temperature Conditions on Egg Diapause in Eastern Tent Caterpillar (Malacosóma americanum), Evergreen Bagworm (Thridòpteryx ephemeraefórmis) and Southern Red Mite (Oligonychus ilicis). - Events in the life cycles of most temperate insects depend upon an accumulation of ther- mal units known as growing degree-days (GDD), which may be calculated by the formula [(Tmajc + Tmi„) / 2] - Tř . Establishment of phenophases by GDD allows accurate prediction of phenophases in subsequent years based upon changes in environmental conditions. An earlier study (Kintz, 1992) conducted to determine whether the GDD's</page><page sequence="34">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 183 required for hatching of the evergreen bagworm ( Thridbpteryx ephemeraefbrmis Haworth) and the eastern tent caterpillar ( Malacosoma americanum Fabricius) under controlled conditions correlated with field data from other studies, produced no hatchlings. This paper reports the results of a redesigned experiment with the addition of the southern red mite ( Oligonychus ilicis McGregor) and the inclusion of controlled light conditions. Hatching of all three species occurred in both light and dark boxes. Hatch- ing GDD ranges compared favorably with certain sets of field observations and not with others.

The Effects of Acid Mine Runoff on the Transport of Particu- late Organic Matter (POM) and Benthic Invertebrate Com- munity Structure in the Tioga River.- The effects of acid mine runoff on the transport of particulate organic matter (POM) and structure of benthic invertebrate communities were studied along the pH gradient of the Tioga River in northcentral Pennsylvania. Similar data were also collected from Pine Creek and the Cowanesque River, both nonper- turbed by acid runoff. The pH gradient of the Tioga River varies from a mean of 7.9 to 4.6. Pine Creek and Cowanes- que River each have a mean pH of 7.7 and 7.6, respectively. POM transport varied down the length of the Tioga River but was generally less than Pine Creek and the Cowanes- que River. Benthic invertebrate communities were poorly developed or absent in low pH environments in the Tioga River and well developed in the two nonperturbed rivers. This study provides a regional comparison of the effects of acid mine runoff on the structure and function of river ecosystems. Kirkland, Gordon L., Jr.*, Evgeny A. Shvarts and Boris I.

Homage to Santa Soricina, or Why Are There So Many Kinds of Screws?- Assemblages of shrews (InsectivorarSoricidae) inhabiting forested regions of the Holarctic are characterized by high alpha diversity. As many as 6-10 or mor shrew species, principally members of the genus Sorex, may occupy individual habitats, especially cool, moist, boreal forests. The frequent coexistence of three or more congeneric soricids, stands in marked contrast to the situation in assemblages of sym- patric small rodents, which typically contain only a single representative of any genus. A challenge for community ecologists is to elucidate the factors that foster the coexis- tence of greater numbers of congeneric shrews than rodents. In this paper we examine the potential importance of five factors: size of the species pool, competition, environmental moisture, nature of the food resource base, and body size. Of these factors, moisture, small body size, and the nature of the food resource base appear to play key roles in foster- ing the high species richness of many shrew communities.

Comparative Study of Mitochondrial DNA in Aquatic Fungi.- The aquatic fungi A. macrogynus and B. emersomi (Chytridiomycetes, Blastocladiales) are valuable research tools in the molecular and genetic study of eukaryotic organisms. The study of their mitochondria along with the mitochondria of the related genus Blastocladia, a facultative anaerobe, was undertaken to compare the real- tive genome sizes and possible functional differences in mtDNA. Mitochondria were isolated from zoospores of the axe- nic cultures of these fungi by differential and density centri- fugation. Mitochondrial activity was determined colori- metrically by reduction of DCIP due to the activity of succinate dehydrogenase. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was isolated and mtDNA genome size determined and compared by agarose electrophoresis of restriction enzyme fragments relative to DNA standards. Data obtained from these Chytridiomycetous fungi were compared to known data from higher fungi and protists. Klemow, Kenneth M., Department of Biology, Wilkes University, Wilkes-Barre, PA 18766. Bioinformatics: A Laboratory Exercise to Introduce Introductory-level Science Majors to the Scientific Literature . - Laboratory exercises in freshman-level biology courses typically enable students to gain a hands-on appreciation for key principles of sub-organismal and organismal biology. Few published exercises introduce students to the general nature of the scientific literature, or to the typical structure of a published article. To that end, a laboratory exercise entitled "Bioin- formatics" was developed to acquaint students enrolled in the Principles of Modern Biology course at Wilkes Univer- sity with the biological literature. Each student is given a package of instructions and data sheets. The instructions include a discussion of the general structure of the bio- logical literature, and describes the process by which an arti- cle is published in a peer-reviewed journal. In the labora- tory, each student is provided with representative literature, including issues of Ecology and Science , a volume from the Annual Review series, a technical book, a set of abstracts from a meeting, and a professional-society newsletter. The students then conduct a comparison examination of each item as directed by the instructions, and record their obser- vations on the data sheets.

Vegetation of " Mountain Run Ponds " Franklin County ; Pennsylvania.- The plant communities were mapped in a group of seven small, shallow, seasonal wetlands. Percent</page><page sequence="35">184 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 cover is high throughout the four larger wetlands but mostly sparse in the tree smaller wetlands. The largest has five concentric zones: deciduous broadleaf swamp forest, graminoid marsh, shrub swamp of dense Cephalanthus , graminoid marsh with sparse Cephalanthus , and marsh dominated by Orontium. A large population of Scirpus ancistrochaetus inhabits the two innermost zones. The other three larger wetlands contain swamp forest surround- ing Cephalanthus shrub swmp and small herbaceous areas. Torreyochloa pallida is the most important associate of Cephalanthus. Acer rubrum, Nyssa sylvatica, and Quercus palustris dominate the swamp forest tree strata while Vaccin- ium corymbosum and Ilex verticillata dominate the tall shrub stratum. Mixed oaks dominate the surrounding upland forest. The wetland soils are low in pH and macro- nutrients. Soil organic matter is greater in the Cephalan- thus and herbaceous zones than in the swamp forests. Kost, Jennifer R.*, Carlow College, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 and Pierette M. Appasamy and Thomas W.

Growth is Not Necessary for Expression of T Cell Differentiation Antigens by Fetal Liver Cells. - Previous experiments show that mouse fetal liver cells cultured with a cytokine, inter- leukin 7 (11^7), express T lymphocyte cell surface antigens (Thyl and Pgpl) compared to cells grown without IL-7. The objective was to find whether these effects were due to pro- liferation of cells already expressing Thyl and Pgpl, or due to induction of expression of these antigens (differentia- tion). Mouse fetal liver cells were cultured for seven days with IL-7 and the drug hydroxyurea, which is known to block cell growth. It was observed that cell growth was blocked by counting the cells on a hemacytometer with a light microscope. The cells were then stained using flour- escently labeled antibodies directed against Thyl or Pgpl and analyzed by flow cytometry. It was found that growth blocked by hydroxyurea did not affect antigen expres- sion. It is concluded that IL-7 induces the expression of the antigens. Kuhn, R.

The Riparian Communities of the Conestoga River Drainage.- The woody riparian communities of the Cones- toga River drainage were studied to determine species com- position, interspecific relationships, and relationships between the physical aspects of the ecosystem and the plant communities. Trees and shrubs were enumerated as canopy, understory, and transgressive, and were quantified in terms of basal area, density and frequency. Position of each specimen along the stream and on the stream bank was noted. Two significant community types were identified using correlation analysis and principal component analy- sis. A northern zone was dominated by Liriodendron tulip- ifera and the southern zone by Platanus occidentalis, Acer negundo, and Acer saccharinum. Composition of the com- munities were most related to soil parent material; adjacent uplands; size, timing, and nature of disturbances; elevation; steam width; in addition to scouring and anoxic soil asso- ciated with flooding.

Evolutionary Aspects of the Nucle- olus Organizer Region (NOR) of the Genome.- The nucle- olus organizer region of the genome contains the genes which code for rRNA. These genes are highly conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. This research involved a study of the NOR region of the genome in terms of (1) general features, (2) study methods, (3) ribosomal gene number and location, and (4) unique features. An attempt was made to prepare a phylogenetic tree for higher animals based on NOR chromosomal location, identified by silver staining and in situ hybridization. Levetter, Kareema J.*, Amith K.

An Observational Study of the Cicada-Killer Wasp, Sphecius speciosus. - During the sum- mer of 1993 we observed the cicada-killer wasp population at Lafayette College and the College Hill area in Easton, Pennsylvania. Sphecius speciosus is a large sphecid wasp which lays its eggs on cicadas it has paralyzed. The wasp knows in advance of the hunt the sex of the egg it will lay, as it captures two cicadas for female eggs and one cicada for male eggs. The wasp stings the cicada in its thoracic nerve ganglia, paralyzing it, before burying it in a subter- ranean chamber and lays an egg on it. In our study we noticed the following trends which have not been previously reported in the literature: 1) females share burrows regu- larly, exhibiting a slight degree of social behavior, 2) females rest in their burrows overnight and 3) females use more than one burrow in more than one area, probably increasing the survival of their offspring.

A World Survey of Avian Mortality at Plate Glass : Preliminary Report. - From 1991 to present, requests for information on bird strikes at plate glass were sent to natural history museums, ornithological newslet- ters, and select individuals in all but the Nearctic Zoogeo- graphie regions. Of approximately 500 individual requests, 65 (13%) responses documented 267 species from 15 orders. Birds were recorded striking glass in all Zoogeographie regions surveyed. Most victims are classified in the orders: Passeriformes (145 species), Columbiformes (30 species), and Falconiformes (18 species). Studies in North America reveal that all flying birds are potentially vulnerable to glass. These preliminary results further support the conclusion that plate glass is a potentially lethal hazard to birds wherever they mutually occur. Lorenz, Ann S. and John M.

Littoral</page><page sequence="36">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 185 Cladocera of inland water bodies of Erie County ; PA. - During September to November 1993, littoral zooplankton were collected from 10 lakes and ponds in inland Erie County, PA. Samples were collected using horizontal hauls of an 80u mesh Wisconsin-style plankton net. In the laboratory, Cladocera were identified and counted in a Sedgewick-Rafter cell. The data will be used to compare the cladoceran fauna of inland water bodies to that of nearshore areas of Lake Erie. The data will also be used to assess the effect of the size of a water body on the species richness of its littoral cladoceran community. Lutton, Lewis M., Ph.D, Mercyhurst College, Erie, PA 16546. The Measurement and Estimation of Maximum Oxygen Consumption. - Mercyhurst College received a 1990 NSF grant (ILIP; USE-9051333) to purchase a breath by breath oxygen analyzer for use in physiology courses. We purchased the Prospector (Cybermedic) from Breath- ing Services, Inc., Ephrata, PA. With this instrument we can also measure tidal volume, C02 production and re- lated parameters. This presentation will demonstrate how we use this in- strument to measure maximum oxygen consumption, max V02, the onset of blood lactate accumulation and the dead space/tidal volume ratio among other values. Student groups are asked to compare these values to those obtained from more traditional methods of estimating max V02. The presentation will include a new procedure we have dev- eloped to estimate max V02 which can be performed at any college. Finally, the presentation will describe interesting ap- proaches to developing student skills in group dynamics, the writing of scientific papers, and the use and under- standing of statistics.

DNA Analysis of Irradiated Raphanus Cotyledons and True Leaves -A comparison of DNA content of irradiated radish {Raphanus) seeds was made between the cotyledons and primary leaves. Mean DNA content in picograms was determined using a FACScan flow cytometer for non-irradiated plants and those irradiated at 50,000, 150,000, 500,000 rads. Radish tissue reveals two peaks of DNA, one representing the G0/G1 nuclei and the second peak representing the G2 nuclei. Irradiated radish leaf tissue in addition presented a third DNA peak indicating tetraploidy or doublets. The DNA was analyzed as to percentage of total DNA, percent- age CV and picograms of DNA.

The Effects of Ethanol on the Male Golden Hamster- Circadian rhythms are endogenous, diurnal timing mechanisms controlled in mammals in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothal- amus. Alteration of this clock is called a phase shift. Alcohol consumption can cause a hangover which is believed to result from dehydration of the body. Some symptoms of a hangover, e.g. malaise, are much like the symptoms of jet lag. In this experiment 24 male hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were housed in cages equipped with running wheels in 14-10 LD (ad libitum food and water). After two weeks isotonic ethanol (.004 mls/g) was injected i.p. Con- trol animals received isotonic saline. Actions of the hamsters were monitored for decreased activity and a disruption in their onsets of activity for two weeks following injections. Hypothesized is that the ani- mals will show a desynchronization in circadian rhythms which are comparable to jet lag.

Elevated Temperature Methanogenesis.- Thermophilic organisms found associated with submarine hotsprings represent a source of potential high temperature enzymes to enhance the conversion of biomass from various sources to methane. Of particular significance is the improvement of rate of reaction and reaction temperature in sludge digesters associated with sewage disposal plants. Pyrodic- tium brockii is one of the first hyperthermophilic bacteria to be isolated, identified and characterized in association with marine hydrothermal vent systems. In this work a number of methanogens are examined at elevated tempera- tures to determine their stability and suitability for methane generation. Closed reaction vessels above 35°C. are used for methane formation and the results compared to cyclic phenomena observed with anaerobic methanogens at am- bient temperatures. Gas chromatography results are given. An attempt will be made to characterize the products by stable isotope carbon analysis to compare with high temp- erature predictions of known gas field accumulations in the Sacramento Basin, California and the deep Delaware-Val Verde Basins of Texas.

Effect of In Vivo Hydrolysis of S-Adenosylmethionine on Methionine Uptake in Escherichia coli . - A MetJ aporepressor/S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) complex represses most genes in the methionine regulon, conse- quently these genes are induced when in vivo SAM concen- trations are low, explaining their induction in cells harbor- ing SAM hydrolase (SAMase) expression vectors. E . coli also imports this methionine through the product of the metD gene, a methionine permease. Because the regulation of this gene is poorly characterized, we incubated cells expressing SAMase activity with C3H3-methionine and followed methionine uptake over time. Cells with SAMase expression vectors grown in either a methionine-rich com- plete medium or a defined medium lacking methionine import the label at about the same rate as those without</page><page sequence="37">186 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 SAMase activity over a five hour period. We are now look- ing for subtle effects of SAMase expression on methionine uptake, but these data strongly suggest the MetJ/SAM repressor complex is not a primary regulator of expression of the metD gene.

Desirability of the Chem- istry Lab Content for the Non Science Major,- The desir- able chemistry lab content from the students' perspective was monitored for several years by use of a questionnaire. The students in the lab course were asked to review the semester's experiments and to place the experiments in one of three groupings indicating whether they desired that ex- periment to be retained, removed, or undecided. They were also asked to state briefly reasons for their liking or dislik- ing the experiments. Analysis of the results and the student comments suggested that non science majors do not enjoy performing experiments which are solely and application of theory, but, do like an experiment if there is the challenge of an "unknown" or uses household/commercial products. The length of time to perform the experiment, or the time to calculate the results and write up the experiment did not influence the desirability. Finally, the quantity of the math- ematical calculations within the experiments had only a slightly negative effect on the desirability of the experiment.

A Comparison of Micro- organisms in Stationary and Portable Eyewash Stations . - The purpose of this study was to evaluate stationary and portable eyewash stations for the presence of bacteria and ameba. A total of 14 eyewash stations were analyzed. Total bacterial cell counts per ml by FITC (fluorescence isothio- cyanate) microscopy averaged 2.0 x 10" for stationary sites and 5.2 x 10" for portable units. For the heterotrophic plate study (R2A agar-Difco), the total counts averaged 3.9 x 10" and 1.2 x 10" cells/ml respectively. Using an asparagine broth-MPN (most probable number) method for Pseudomonas , stationary samples averaged 37 cells/ 100 ml, while the portable units averaged 351 cells/ ml. Legionella cell counts by DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) averaged 3.6 x 10" in stationary samples and 7.2 and 10" in portable samples. No Legionella were detected by cultural methods. Amebic cyst counts averaged 9.8 x 10" cysts/ml in stationary units and 4.0 x 10"cysts/ml in portable units. By cultural methods, active ameba were detected only in stationary units. All units contained Legionella (by DFA), while nine units were confirmed positive for Pseudomonas using ace- tamide broth. Bacterial counts were higher in portable units, while amebic cyst counts were higher in stationary units. McCarty, Melissa A* Carlow College, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 and Dawn A.

Preganglionic Projection Patterns in Avian Sympathetic Systems.- The patterns of pregang- lionic projections in the avian sympathetic system are highly specific. Preganglionic axons from the T1 spinal seg- ment project in a predominanti rostral direction, while axons from the T4 spinal segment project in a predomi- nantly caudal direction. Axons from the preganglionic cells in T2 and T3 segments project in both directions. These patterns are correct from the outset of development. Axons originating in T2 and T3 may be capable of bifur- cation once in the sympathetic trunk, and therefore one preganglionic neuron may be capable of sending an axon in both the rostral and caudal directions. If cell bodies displaying a double Dil/DiO label could be found, it is possible that these cells can bifurcate and send axons in both directions. If not, it is possible that pregang- lionic cells cannot send projections in both directions. McClurg, Alyce L * and Howard K. Reinert, Trenton State College, Trenton, NJ and Lauretta M.

DNA Fingerprinting for Genetic Com- parisons of Snake Populations.- The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique enables a single oli- gonucleotide primer of arbitrary sequence to direct the PCR amplification of DNA. The oligonucleotide primers are used to detect and amplify genetic polymorphisms which has been shown to be useful as genetic markers in other species. This study focuses on the timber rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus , to determine the utility of the RAPD technique for the identification of variable genetic markers useful in distinguishing among individuals and popula- tions. The study has identified several potentially useful markers to distinguish between specific individuals with several RAPD primers.

Downy Woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) Prédation on the Goldenrod Gallmaker ; Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae)-T&gt;ovmy woodpeckers attack the galls of Eurosta during the late autumn and winter. Several studies have suggested that woodpeckers avoid galls containing Eurosta's natural enemies by searching for the epidermal caps of Eurosta exit tunnels. Since galls lacking tunnels con- tain parasitoids, we predict that woodpeckers will avoid tunnel-less galls. Furthermore, since woodpeckers attack galls from the top and middle, we hypothesize that healthy Eurosta contained in galls with tunnels exiting below the gall's equator should be avoided more often than those exit- ing at or above the equator. To test these hypotheses, we collected, x-rayed and assigned 1,000 galled stems of the goldenrod, Solidago altissima to categories based on gall content. Galls were randomly distributed into two plots and were monitored weekly. Both attacks and tap marks were recorded and preliminary data indicate the woodpeckers use the absence or presence of exit tunnels as a cue to the presence of Eurosta.</page><page sequence="38">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 187 Merkle, Jeff*, Rameen Hashemiyoon and Shyamal K.

Cytotoxic and Surface Ultrastructural Effects of an Antischistomal Drug on Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells.- The cytotoxicity of antimony potassium tar- trate (APT), an antischistosomal drug, was assessed on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using the trypan blue dye exclusion technique. Surface ultrastructural changes in CHO cells were evaluated utilizing the scanning electron microscope (SEM). CHO cells were treated with concen- trations of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 fig/ ml APT for 24, 48, and 72 hrs., with appropriate controls. An ISI Super Illa SEM was used to analyze CHO samples that had previously been dehydrated in a graded acetone series, critical point dried, and sputter gold coated. Trypan blue analysis revealed dose and time dependent decreases between the control and 10 ļig/ ml concentration, with less significant differences noted in those cells treated with the other concentrations. However, the viability of cells treated with APT was not affected appreciably, which is an indication that the agent's effect on CHO cell multiplication was, in most instances, cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Preliminary SEM obser- vations have shown a progressive increase in the amount of cellular blebbing with a reduction of microvilli on the cell surface. Exposure to 10 /¿g/ml APT resulted in, on occasions, the formation of minute to large holes on the cell surface as well as lysed cells past the 48 hour treat- ment period.

Scatterhoard- ing Strategies of Gray Squirrels : Behavioral Responses to Risk of Competition- Several studies have experimentally examined the caching behavior of scatterhoarding animals, but few have tested the behavioral responses of such ani- mals in relation to the activity of potential competitors. We hypothesize that gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) exhibit sensitivity to the risk of cache robbery and alter decisions about where to cache and whether to cache or eat when faced with this risk. To test the effect of competition on the caching behavior of gray squirrels, we presented individual free ranging animals with red oak acorns on repeated, alter- nating treatment days: one in which there was no attempt to recover cached seeds and a second during which all seeds were recovered by the observer. During each trial, we measured caching distances, caching frequencies, and caching times. In a second experiment, we tested the effects of neighboring intraspecific competitors on the caching decisions of gray squirrels. Results support the hypothesis that gray squirrels modify caching decisions, invest more energy in caching activity, and cache at greater distances when faced with the risk of competitors.

Enhanced Fitness in Plant Develop- ment as a Result of Organ Loss. - Organ biomass and lengths were determined for Japanese Morning-glory plants that had structural parts excised when 16 days of age. An intact control and 4 treatment groups were allowed to complete their life cycle; i.e. to go from seed-to-seed, which took 75 days. Treatment groups included elimination of the: 1) terminal bud, 2) primary root, 3) cotyledon, or 4) basal 1/2 of the hypocotyl and primary root. Both vegetative and reproductive organs were analyzed. All plants, having undergone simulated herbivory, attained a greater total biomass than intact controls - except for the treatment group in which excision of the hypocotyl base and root occurred. Biomass of lateral roots was significantly greater in all treatment groups as well. Total seed and fruit number, seed weight/fruit, individual fruit weight, and seed and fruit weight/plant were all significantly increased in the treatment group which had previously "lost" 1 cotyledon.

Modern Structural and Spatial Changes in the American Labor Force- -The structure of the American labor force has been in constant change for the past two centuries but never before have the changes been as dramatic as in recent years. A number of factors are affecting the character of the labor force. Most significant is the development of global competition. In order to be competitive industries must restructure operations and in the process eliminate employees to reduce costs and maintain profits. Other fac- tors affecting the structure and spatial distribution of the labor force are the changes from a war to a peacetime economy, the growth of women in the labor force, the increasing use of automation to replace workers, reduction of not only blue collar but also white collar positions, increasing use of part time labor, increasing worker amenities, and the growing number of self employed. This paper analyzes the spatial and structural changes that are altering the present day American labor force. Milligan, Denise M., Shippensburg University, Shippens- berg, PA 17257. Wound Healing Evaluation of Tape Strip- ped Healthy Human Skin.- This study was designed to test the effect of two products on wound healing. On each of the fourteen volunteers, two areas of the back below the shoulder blade were stripped with 4" x 1" duct tape until exhibiting a glistening red appearance. Two different band- aids were placed about 2.45 cm apart on the stripped area. The extent of the skin damage was monitored for one week by using noninvasive techniques measuring the transepider- mal water loss (TWL) with an evaporimeter and the degree of redness using the Minolta chromameter and the Diastron erythema meter. By the third day the covered sites showed lowered TWL and less redness, thus returning back to normal conditions faster. The efficacy of the two types of band-aids could also be determined. Finer distinctions in the healing process was possible with the evaporimeter com- pared to either the chromameter and the erythema meter.</page><page sequence="39">188 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 Mineo, L.*, S.

Fine Root Analysis of Healthy and Declining Forest Grown White Oaks- a Long-term Study. - Although symptoms of forest decline in Eastern North America have been reported in recent decades (Hinrichsen, 1987; Halma, 1986; Puckett, 1982) questions remain about the underlying physiological causes of the decline. Since fine roots are important acquisi- tion and storage areas of forest trees, the fine roots of healthy and declining white oaks (Quercus alba) were com- pared. Three characteristics of fine roots were analyzed- biomass, root tip frequency (RTF), and starch granule counts - from autumn collections of soil/root cores of healthy and declining white oaks of a mature mixed oak woodland (Northampton County, Pennsylvania). Canopy characteristics were used to classify healthy trees from those in decline (healthy = large canopy with minimal dieback and no adventitous shoots on the bole; trees in decline = small canopy with dieback and/or adventitious shoots). Fine root biomass, RTF's, and starch content of healthy oaks were higher than those of declining trees during each year of study. Annual differences indicate the influence of weather patterns on all fine root characteristics studied.

Effects of Tyrphostins on Uterine Growth in Immature Rat. -This study was conducted to characterize the effective- ness of tyrphostins, Genistein, Tyrphostin-25, and Tyr- phostin B-48, as tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors of uterine growth. Estradiol (E2)-initiated uterine growth responses were analyzed in 21-day old ovarectomized pre-pubescent rats. After a 3 day recovery, four treatment groups were injected at time t = 0: Group 1) saline-injected: 40/¿g/kg; 2)E2:40/*g/kg; 3) tyrphostin (either Genistein: 10 mg/kg, Tyrphostin-25: 4.25 mg/kg, or Tyrphostin-B48: 4.25 mg/kg); 4) E2 + respective tyrphostin. At t = 24 hrs, rats were sacri- ficed and their uteri removed. Uterine growth parameters measured: wet weights, protein content, and DNA synthetic activity. All three drugs increased rates of DNA synthesis when compared with saline-injected animals. The magni- tude of these responses was less than the responses induced by E2. These drugs did not alter wet weight or protein con- tent values significantly. This in vivo study demonstrates that the TK inhibitors have seemingly stimulatory effects on the rates of DNA biosynthesis in the rat uterus.

Minimum-change Cate- gories for Dynamic Spatial-temporal Choropleth Maps. - A dynamic choropleth map is a temporally-ordered se- quence of cartographic "snapshots," each representing an instant or period of time. Each map in the series typically appears on the screen for so brief a time that the viewer can- not examine details. A single classification is applied to the entire sequence so that a substantial rise or fall in value should trigger a change in category. If the classification has only two or three categories, and if areal units change cate- gories infrequently, the viewer should be able to identify major historical and geographic trends. A bin-scoring method for evaluating potential category breaks can help the map author minimize trivial and unwarranted category changes that reflect comparatively small changes in value.

Alien Woody Plant Invasions in Pennsylvania : A Preliminary Ecobotanical Assessment.- The documented woody flora of Pennsylvania consists of 509 taxa, of which 182 (35%) are non-native. The majority of alien woody plants (76%) are infrequently naturalized or persist from cultivation but a subset (44 taxa) are freely reproducing and (or) possess invasive tendencies. Deciduous shrubs (54.6%) are the dominant alien taxa. On a statewide basis, richness of naturalized alien woody plants is greatest in the Ridge and Valley (43 taxa), Piedmont (42 taxa) and nonglaciated Allegheny Plateaus (39 taxa), Physiographic Provinces, intermediate in the New England (31 taxa), Coastal Plain (31 taxa), glaciated Allegheny Plateaus (28 taxa), and Cen- tral Lowlands Provinces (26 taxa), and least in the Blue Ridge Province (14 taxa). Alien woody taxa primarily occur in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and edges which serve as foci for invasion of adjacent habitats. Moyer, Wendy J.* and P.

Survey and Seasonal Com- parison of the Invertebrates of a Small, Shallow Temporary Pond. - Small, shallow temporary ponds usually are overlooked. The importance of puddles as habitats will be recognized only through documentation. A small sample of water was taken from a sidewalk puddle daily whenever water was present. Several wet mounts were viewed from each sample with a compound microscope. The inverte- brates found were documented on video tape and photo- graphed using a digitizer. Samples collected during late summer and early fall contained numerous protozoans {Vorticella, Amoeba, small flagellates, and ciliates) and rotifers (Philodina). Late fall was characterized by a marked reduction in protozoans, leaving only a few Vorticella and small ciliates. Rotifers declined in abundance, and Brach- ionus appeared. The most apparent changes were an in- crease in size and abundance of nematodes and the intro- duction of Tardigrades. Temperature, length of wet periods, and seasonal changes in allochthonous input appear to be the most important factors determining the inhabitants of this puddle. Munro, R.K.* and P.F.

Additional questions focus on whether there are concentration peaks during an annual cycle, whether some genera concentrate specific metals or higher concentrations of metals, and whether there are higher levels of concentration at specific sampling sites. Sampling was conducted at three stations at fourteen day intervals over one year from June 1992 to June 1993. A second phase utilized one to four month sampling inter- vals. Analysis is done with a Topcon ABT60 SEM and a Princeton Gamma-Tech X-ray fluorescent analytical sys- tem. Preliminary qualitative data indicates that lead and mercury are found at all three sites in all genera and dur- ing all months of the year. Current work focuses on the re- maining questions and quantitative analysis. Murphy, Thomas*, Brandon Naples, Dan Morgan, Chris Dietz, Aaron Shurtlef f and Jack R.

Attachment of Freshwater Dinoflagellates Relative to Substrate Orientation.- We explored the role of substrate orientation on the attachment of freshwater dinoflagellate zygotes and vegetative cells. Artificial glass substrates were placed into Faylor Lake, Union Co. Pennsylvania during Autumn 1993. The substrates measured 12mm in diameter and were attached to wooden squares oriented in three directions: perpendicular to the surface, facing toward the surface, and facing away from the surface. At three week intervals substrates were removed and prepared for stand- ard SEM examination. The glass substrates were examined to determine the number of vegetative and zygotic cells per unit area for each dinoflagellate species. The results indi- cate Peridinium inconspicuum tend to attach at higher rates on perpendicular and upwardly facing substrates. Gym- nodiniumfuscum was found on the substrates which were oriented away from the surface, possibly indicating a preference for the dark during attachment.

The Identification of a Cosmid Clone Contain- ing the nimQ Gene in Aspergillus nidulans. - The cell cycle is a phenomenon where many regulatory mechanisms re- main to be identified and characterized. Aspergillus nidulans , a filamentous fungus, is a powerful genetic tool to further understand the cell cycle. The temperature sen- sitive mutant nimQIO (never-in-mitosis) of Aspergillus nidulans is blocked in S-phase. The nimQIO gene has been mapped to linkage group VII. The purpose of this study is to identify the genomic clone that contains the wild type nimQ gene. The genomic cosmid clones localized to linkage group VII, have been purified by maxi cosmid preparations into the nimQ mutant and analyzed for their ability to rescue the temperature sensitive phenotype of this mutant. The identification of the nimQ gene is an important step in understanding its role in S-phase. Navin, Terence F.* and Mary E.

Increased Intra-luminal Pressure (ILP) Elicits an In- crease in Mitotic Density in the Chick Embryonic Brain. - Rapid brain expansion in the fluid-filled embryonic brain has been shown to be partially mediated by intra-luminal pressure (ILP). We tested the hypothesis that an experimen- tal increase in ILP increased the mitotic density, the number of metaphase cells per tissue volume, of the neuroepi- thelium lining the brain cavity. ILP was increased for one hour in the brains of stage 21 chick embryos by the con- tinuous addition of fluid via a gravity-driven pressure system. Sham control embryos were intubated for one hour with a glass rod. All embryos were fixed, and serial sections were prepared. Mitotic densities for the midbrains were then determined using a computerized image analysis system. Preliminary data suggest a significant increase in the mitotic density of experimental brains (1.52 x 10s ± 4.11 X 104 cells/mm3) compared to control brains (8.13 x IO4 ± 1.28 x 104 cells/mm3; p = 0.05).

Potentiometrie Studies of Organotin Compounds- Organotin compounds (OTC) are being potentiometrically analyzed for their ionization constants by the determination of standard potentials, e°, Potentiometrie titrations, and calculations of K, using the Nernst Equation: e = e" - JĒL In K, otnF where R = 8.314 J/mol, K, T = 298 K, F = 96,484 Coulombs, n = 1 electron, and a = the transfer coefficient. The following compounds are under study: tri-n-butyltin fluoride (TBTF), tri-n-butyltin chloride (TBTC1), tri-n- butyltin bromide (TBTBr), tri-n-butyltin iodide (TBTI), and tri-n-butyltin acetate (TBTOAc). The standard poten- tials were determined for these OTC, however, they need refining before relating them to the electromotive series. Potentiometrie titrations have also been completed and they show a difference in the ionization potential for each anion ligand attached to the OTC moiety. This indicates a difference in the K7 even though the organotin moiety is the same. The equilibrium constants will be determined as soon as reliable e° are obtained.

The Inhibitory Effects of LrCanavanine on</page><page sequence="41">190 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 Cultured Rat Hepatocyte Cells. - L-Canavanine, a nonpro- tein amino acid found in many leguminous plants is related structurally to L-arginine. We cultured rat liver hepatocyte cells, introduced canavanine and found the amino acid to exhibit marked inhibition of cell propagation. At a concen- tration as low as 0.1 mM, canavanine limited cell culture propagation, while at 50.0mM, cell growth was non- existent. The LD-50 for L-canavanine was found to be approximately lO.OmM. Canavanine treated cells were ex- posed to arginine to see if the addition could revive slowed cell growth. Revival rates based on ratios between the two amino acids were made using diode-array spectrophotom- etry and standard hemocytometer procedures, including vital staining. This study supports the contention that the incorporation of canavanine into proteins in place of argin- ine contributes significantly to canavanine's property of propagation inhibition.

Light and Scanning Electron Microscopy of the Gypsy Moth Fungus , Entomophaga- maimaiga, in Diseased and Dead Gypsy Moth, Lymantria - The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar ; is the most destructive forest pest insect in PA. In 1989, a fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga (EM), was found to be the cause of an epizootic of the gypsy moth (GM) in several northeastern states. The virulence of this phycomycetous fungus against the GM is well documented, but little is known about the electron microscopy of this fungus on and within diseased GM larvae and cadavers. This research was undertaken to deter- mine the light and scanning electron microscopic morph- ology of EM conidia and resting spores. These two infective fungal propagules are necessary for the infection and path- ogenicity of GM larvae. We adapted a modified freeze substitution (MFS) procedure to prepare the GM cadavers for scanning electron microscopy. After the MFS, the fungal propagules were critically-point dried, mounted on a metal stub, sputter-coated and observed via SEM. The conidia and resting spores, in vivo , were not affected by the procedure and their exteriors and that of the GM larvae were easily observed. Developing conidia were numerous and the resting spores filled the cadaver. This research is a cooperative undertaking of California University of PA, the PA Bureau of Forestry and the United States Forest Service. Niesenbaum, Richard A.*, Barbara E. Nicholson and Sheila K.

Loving the One You're With: Self-pollination and Its Effects in Mirabilis jalapa. - Plant species which normally exhibit high levels of selfing should exhibit little or no inbreeding depression because deleterious recessive alleles tend to be rapidly purged from predominantly selfing populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined pollen performance, seed set, and offspring vigor under self-pollination, pollination with a single outcross donor, and pollination with multiple out- cross donors in the predominantly self-pollinated Mirabilis jalapa. Pollen load size was kept constant. Results indicate that self pollen is more likely to penetrate the stigma, and their tubes are more likely to enter the style than outcross pollen. Seed set was greater in pollinations with multiple pollen donors than with single or self-pollination. Seeds from self-pollinations were only slightly smaller than those from outcross pollinations, and seedling performance did not vary across treatments. Other than reduced seed set, self pollination is not detrimental in this predominantly selfing plant.

Application of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization and Whole Chromo- some Painting in the Study of the Philadelphia Chromo- some. - Chronic Myelongenous Leukemia is characterized by the Philadelphia Chromosome. This translocation occurs between chromosomes 9 and 22, and involves the ber gene of chromosome 22 and the abl gene of chromosome 9. Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) has been used in recent genetic studies involving the Philadelphia Chromo- some. FISH provides more information for research than the traditional banding techniques, and the process can be completed in two days. The objective is to show the Phila- delphia Chromosome translocation t(9;22) (q34;qll) by utilizing a Whole Chromosome Painting System and FISH. Bone marrow cells from patients with Ph+ Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia will be studied. Chromosomes 9 and 22 will be painted, one with SpectrumGreen and one with SpectrumOrange. The ber gene of chromosome 22 will be one color, and the abl gene of chromosome 9 will be a different color, thus producing two separate signals. This will indicate that the translocation has occurred. Ort, Kimberley A.*, Salii Latscher and Aline M. Harrison, York College of Pennsylvania, York, PA 17405-7199. Studies of Trace Lead in Drinking Water. - EPA has indi- cated that drinking water now accounts for 20% of lead exposure for persons in the US. The presence of lead has been declared a health hazard, especially for children, and thus standards have been set for maximum quantities of this metal in drinking water. Using a reliable, commercially available test kit, we have tested first-of-day water samples from a variety of day-care and elementary school locations in the York and Lancaster areas. Five of the locations tested had lead levels above the EPA-acceptable limit (several other locations were near it). While this is only about 13%, if the consequences of lead poisoning were to occur in such a percentage, the financial and population effects could be considerable. The testing procedures, test results, and ramifications of the findings will be discussed.</page><page sequence="42">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 191 Overpeck, Craig A.* and Ellen M.

A Scanning Electron Microscope Comparison of Olfactory Structures in Three Species of Salamanders . - Salamanders and most tetrapods have two olfactory regions, the main olfactory and vomeronasal areas which contain receptors and other cells. Olfactory receptors are bipolar neurons with a single axon and dend- rite which projects onto the epithelial surface. Receptors in both areas bind odorants dissolved in air or water. The morphology of Plethodon glutinosis and P. cinereus, two terrestrial species and Notophthalmus viridescens, an aquatic species, were compared using an Abbott Topcon-60 SEM. Plethodontid species were similar in structural fea- tures. Clumps of knobular cilia in the posterior vomer- onasal area were walled by a ridge of smooth, unciliated epithelial cells running from the external nares to the posterior. The main olfactory area in terrestrial species was evenly carpeted with cilia from dendrites unlike the aquatic species which had compartments of cilia formed by several ciliated ridges running medioanterior to lateroposterior. These results are similar to other comparisons of aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. Pagano, Angela M.*, and CR.

The Effects of Energy Content on Feeding Preference in the Flesh Fly ; Sarcophaga bullata. - Amino acid content in floral nectars has been shown to affect feeding preferences in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata . Nectars supply different levels of energy dependent upon their amino acid content. To in- vestigate if feeding choices are influenced by energy con- tent, flies were given a choice of modified mimic nectars. Mimic nectars for which flies had previously demonstrated a preference were modified to obtain equivalent energy values. These energetically equivalent nectars were pre- sented in a pair wise fashion to individual flies and con- sumption of each measured. Preliminary statistical analysis of data using a paired t-test show no difference in consump- tion of mimic nectars (&gt;0.05). This suggests that energy is a variable important in directing feeding preferences in these flies.

A Statistical Comparison of Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Populations Before and After the Zebra Mussel (Dreisenna polymorpha) Invasion Lake Erie : Erie , PA.- This preliminary study examined the changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton densities in the Presque Isle area of Lake Erie, Erie, PA before and after the arrival of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha . The phytoplankton and zooplankton population data for the years 1975-1991 at three sampling stations were analyzed using average popu- lation and statistical methods of Median test for signifi- cance. The average population did indicate a trend of decrease in the phytoplankton and zooplankton popula- tion for 1991. Additionally, the average population for the study years, particularly phytoplankton, was less than the average population of the Baseline years (prior to the zebra mussel invasion). The median test did indicate a significant difference in the phytoplankton and zooplankton popula- tion at the three sampling stations for many of the Fall sampling years, particularly 1989 and 1991.

Identification of the Genomic Clone Containing the nimC gene from Asper- gillus nidulans. - Identification of genes controlling regu- latory function essential for the passage through the cell cycle, is useful in cancer research. The filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, molecular and classical genetics are extensively developed. One temperature-sensitive mutant of Aspergillus, nimC107 or wot in mitosis, is blocked in S phase. It has been mapped to linkage group V. The goal of this study is to obtain a genomic clone containing the nimC gene. Pools of DNA from linkage group V specific genomic library are being purified. These clones will be tested for the ability to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the nimC mutant. Once nimC genomic clone has been identified, its role in DNA replication can be examined in more detail. Paterson, Ann* and James Sidie, Ursinus College, College- ville, PA 19426. SEM Analysis of Pollen Loads Carried by Worker Honeybees (Apis mellifera).-We examined the pollen grains carried by worker honeybees both in the pol- len basket and on the body surface. Pollen foragers were collected at the hive entrance as they returned from a forag- ing trip. The metathoracic leg, containing the pollen basket, as well as other body parts were sputter-coated (100A./gold/ palladium) and examined in the SEM (TOPCON ABT60) at 12-1 5kv. SEM photographs were studied for pollen iden- tification and estimates of pollen load carried. Samples were collected Nov./Dec. 1993. The majority of grains examined most closely resemble Ragweed ( Ambrosia ) but are not identical to published reports. None of the pollen observed resembled Goldenrod (Solidago) or Aster (Aster) which should be the dominant types at this season. The Ragweed-type grains appeared to be embedded in propolis (plant resin). Occasional tree pollen grains were observed on bee body surfaces. The dominant grain type had a mean diameter 30-31u. Calculated pollen loads ranged 135,000- 441,000 grains/pollen basket. Further studies will examine foraging characteristics in other seasons. Peeler, T.C, S.D. Ely* J.V. Hackett and M.T.

Changes in tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cardiac Cell Proteins in Response to Angiotensin II- Angiotensin II, an eight amino acid peptide that regulates blood pres- sure, has also been shown to stimulate the growth of car-</page><page sequence="43">192 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 diac cells in culture. Angiotensin II binds to a specific G- protein coupled receptor on the surface of both cariomyo- cytes and cardiac fibroblasts. In order to determine if angiotensin II stimulates cell growth through a cascade of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, cardiac cells were exposed to angiotensin II (10~8 M) for various time periods, and the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation deter- mined for each treatment by Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. Several groups of proteins were observed to change their level of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II within 5 minutes following treatment. The effects of angiotensin II treatment were blocked by EXP, a specific inhibitor of the angiotensin II receptor. These results suggest that the ef- fects of angiotensin II on cardiac cell growth is mediated through a tyrosine phosphorylation pathway. Pehlman, Jamie M.*, Jeff Kukliński, Melanie Glick and Mary B.

Scanning Electron Microscopy Study Comparing Pollen of Triploid Marigolds of Different Origins . - A comparison was made of the morphology of marigold pollen obtained from two triploid strains and the parental types, Tagetes erecta and Tagetes patula. The pollen of the two parents and the two triploids were sputter coated with a gold plati- num alloy and viewed under the Topcon ABT-60 scanning electron microscope. Pollen from the triploid hybrids showed significant abnormalities not present in either parent. Pollen was analyzed as to variation in size as well as morphological differences. Peiffer, David R.* and S. Herzog, The Pennsylvania State University at Mont Alto, Mont Alto, PA 17237.- The possi- bility of using a commercial solar cell as a device to detect position and movement (velocity) is investigated experi- mentally by using the motion of the object to vary the amount of exposed surface area. The resulting voltage out- put of the cell is highly non-linear which is adverse to a desirable uniform sensitivity. Satisfactory improvement was achieved by optimizing either the value of an external resistor or the geometric shape of the active surface area of the cell. To detect movement the time response of the solar cell has to be adequate which could be achieved only when using external resistors. Peretz, Shani* Donna W. Vogler and Andrew G.

Plasticity of Male Traits in Campanula rapunculoides. -This study examines environmental and genetic effects on the expression of male traits of Campanula rapun- culoides . Seven plants from a wild population were prop- agated and two clones of each plant were grown under three greenhouse conditions: 1) hot with intense light; 2) cool with humid conditions; and 3) pot-bound with crowded conditions. Throughtout their flowering cycle, each clone in each environment was examined daily and the follow- ing traits were measured: nectar production, flower number and size, and pollen production, viability, percent germina- tion and in vitro growth. Preliminary results indicate that environment, genotype and an interaction between the two all have significant effects on both nectar production and corolla area. These findings indicate that there are signifi- cant differences in the plasticity of the seven genotypes in regard to traits that affect the reproductive performance of C. rapunculoides .

High Performance Thin- Lay er Chromatographic Analysis of Sugars in Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda) Infected with Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda). - High performance thin-layer chromato- graphic analysis was done on the hemolymph and digestive gland-gonad complex (DGG) of Biomphalaria glabrata snails experimentally infected with the intramolluscan stages of Echinostoma caproni. The major sugars detected in both the DGG and hemolymph of infected and unin- fected snails were glucose and trehalose. Quantitative analysis by scanning densitometry showed a significant reduction in glucose in both the hemolymph and DGG of infected snails at 4, 6, and 8 weeks postinfection. A similar analysis on trehalose showed that this sugar was signifi- cantly reduced at 6 weeks postinfection in the hemolymph and DGG of infected snails and could not be detected from these sites in infected snails by 8 weeks postinfection. Find- ings from this study were compared with information on sugars in B. glabrata infected with larval stages of Schisto- soma monsoni. Perot, Jocelyn M.*, Warren G. Abrahamson and Jonathan M.

The Role of Gall Traits in Determin- ing Host-Race Emergence Times of the Gallmaker Eur osta solidaginis Fitch (Diptera:Tephritidae).- Two host-races of Eurosta solidaginis , differ in phenology. Flies from Solidago gigantea emerge lOd earlier than those from S. altissima . Plant color influences gall color, which in turn may influence internal gall temperature and thus fly dev- elopment. We tested the hypothesis that emergence differ- ences between host-races were caused by host-plant traits. We measured light reflectance at 633nm and internal gall temperature from galls of both host races from a MN site. S. gigantea galls were significantly more red than S. altis- sima galls, but internal temperatures did not significantly differ. To test if the emergence differences could be affected by light treatment, we monitored emergence for galls of each host-race in sun and shade. Flies from S. gigantea emerged before those from the shade. The interaction and light treatment was significant, such that the emergence time of flies from S. altissima was speeded up than S. gigantea. These results do not support the hypothesis that the present emergence differences are principally due to host-plant traits.</page><page sequence="44">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 193 Pidcock, Kenneth*, Department of Biology, Wilkes Univer- sity, Wilkes-Barre, PA 18766 and Hassan Namdari, Clinical Laboratories, Inc., Scranton, PA 18509. Bacterial Ribotype Analysis Using a Subcloned DNA Probe . - Ribotype analysis allows for intraspecific typing of bacteria using restriction fragment length polymorphisms detected by hybridization to rRNA-coding sequences. Application of ribotype analysis for infection control epidemiology would benefit from the availability of a standard probe that is easily prepared. The rRNA-coding sequences of the Escherichia coli rrnB operon are contained in a 5.4 kbp Bell fragment of the recombinant plasmid pKK3535 (Brosius et al., Plasmid 5:112, 1981). This fragment was purified, end-modified by addition of Pstl sites, then subcloned into pUC19. The resulting probe production plasmid, pRRNB, is replicated in very high copy number and allows prepara- tion of ribotype probe DNA at concentrations exceeding 400 ng/ml culture. Probe DNA prepared from pRRNB has been used to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial Acinetobacter infections. Pikula, F.* and J.E.

The Effects of Protein Deficiency in Swiss Web- ster Mice Infected with Echinostoma caproni.-1 Twenty- four, male Swiss Webster mice were divided into four dietary groups: normal diet uninfected (Group A), normal diet infected (Group B), protein deficient uninfected (Group C), and protein deficient infected (Group D). The animals were administered their respective diet for three weeks and then group B and D animals were infected with 30 metacercarial cysts of Echinostoma caproni On day 14 PI the mice from all groups were killed. The relative splenic and adrenal weights were recorded. Differential white blood cell counts hematocrit and hemoglobin values were ob- tained. The percent infectivity and percent resistance were determined for the infected animals.

Investigations Into the Autonomic Control of the Heart Rate and Blood Pressure of the Mudpuppy.-To investigate the roles of the sympathetic and parsympathetic innerva- tion on the heart rate and blood pressure of Necturus maculos we applied agonists and antagonists directly to the heart while recording from a cannula implanted in the efferent artery of the third gill arch. The heart rate and mean arterial pressure were calculated from the polygraph recordings. Adding either the parasympathetic neurotrans- mitter, acetylcholine, or the acetylcholine antagonist, atropine, decreased the heart rate and blood pressure. To date, no effects have been noted for the possible sym- pathetic transmitter dopamine. Norepinephrine and epine- phrine may increase the blood pressure but do not seem to influence the heart rate. The sympathetic alpha receptor agonist, phenylephrine, does not change the heart rate and blood pressure, but application of the alpha anatogonist, diperoxane, lead to rapid declines in both parameters. The beta receptor agonist (isoproterenol) and antagonist (pro- pranolol) appear to have no effects. We have demonstrated that parasympathetic innervation influences heart rate and blood pressure, but more investigations are needed to clarify the role of the sympathetic innervation.

The nimO (never-in-mitosis) Gene of Aspergillus nidulans Encodes a Potential Homolog of the Budding Yeast Gx/S Regulator, DBF4.- The nimO gene of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans is required for DNA replication and additionally may be part of the checkpoint control that prevents mitosis from occurring until S phase is completed. In the nimOlS conditional-lethal mutant, nuclei fail to replicate DNA, yet a large proportion enter mitosis and terminally arrest at late anaphase (S. James, unpublished results). To investigate the molecular basis of nimO function, we sequenced a nimO cDNA. The nimO cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 72.8 kd, and shares limited homology with the DBF4 gene of budding yeast which is required for the initiation of DNA replication. nimO and DBF4 are especially conserved in a C-terminal domain which shows striking homology to Cys2-His2 zinc fingers. Although the two genes are related in structure and are required for DNA replication, nimO differs importantly from DBF4 by its apparent involvement in establishing the mitotic entry checkpoint.

Sequence Diversity in the Mitochondrial DNA D-loop in Human Identical Twins Compared to Human Siblings- Mito- chondrial DNA is a small circular piece of DNA that is separate from the chromosomes. Although mtDNA has a highly conserved sequence, there is a small section called the D-loop which is the most variable region of the mitochondrial DNA. It is within the D-loop that mutations are likely to accumulate. By studying the sequence of the D-loop of human twins and siblings, we can see how much variation exists between the two. We are optimizing sequence analysis without the use of radioisotopes by research students and classes at Ursinus College.

Assessing the Status of Streams: A Qualitative Approach . - Since the development of the saprobien system of indicator organism classification in Europe in 1908, aquatic biologists have sought an assessment technique which would facilitate the interpretation of the status of flowing waters.

For one reason or another most have been found wanting. The authors argue that a viable alternative to numerical techniques is a more quali- tative approach to stream assessment. Information avail- able today on the biology and life history of many organims is a valuable resource which has not been seriously used in stream status assessments. Coupled with water quality analysis, qualitative assessment is a technique which should seriously be considered. Proch, Thomas, Pa.

Using Freshwater Mussels (MolluscœUnionidae) To Assess the Status of the Ohio River Drainage in Pennsylvania- Since 1990 the authors have evaluated the mussel fauna throughout the Ohio basin in Pennsylvania. Every stream of third order or larger was examined for freshwater mussels and com- pared to the historic records of A.E. Ortmann. We found that the majority of the extant fauna are found in only three drainages. These include French Creek, the upper Alle- gheny River and Dunkard Creek. Ortmann's collections from 1900-1920 contained at least 53 species in the Ohio basin. We collected about half that number. Historically diverse streams now harbor only a few species, and in others the Unionidae have been extirpated. The loss of this fauna is attributed to dam building, agricultural activities, factory and municipal discharges, mine drainage and other anthropomorphic activities.

The Effects of Inbreeding on Pollen Perform- ance in Campanula rapunculoides . - Inbreeding can result in the expression of deleterious recessive alleles and thereby depress sporophytic vigor. Because many genes are expressed in both the sporophyte and gametophyte, the impairing traits might also be detected in pollen vigor. In order to examine possible inbreeding depression in the gametophy- tic phase, pollen performance of individuals from a natural population of Campanula rapunculoides was compared to that of selfed progeny. Pollen performance was evaluated using both in vitro and semi-in vivo techniques. Viability staining and percent germination on a nutrient agar media determined pollen vigor. Pollen tube growth was observed both by noting time of pollen tube emergence at the base of an excised style and measuring pollen tube growth on an agar media. Decreased pollen performance in the selfed progeny would indicate inbreeding depression; however, preliminary analysis indicates that imbreeding depression may not be manifested in the male gametophytic phase.

Allelism of Two Aspergillus nidulans nim (never-in- mitosis) Mutations that Cause Arrest in the Gx or S Phase of the Cell Cycle- -The nimP'9 and nimSll mutations of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans cause cell cycle arrest at the S and Gx phases, respectively, suggesting that normal gene function is required for transit through these cell cycle stages (S. James, unpublished results). The two mutations were genetically characterized using linkage analysis and complementation tests. The mutations were tightly linked to one another and mapped to a locus on the right arm of Linkage Group VI. They were recessive in heterozygous diploids, and failed to complement one another in balanced heterokaryons. Together these results demonstrate that the mutations are allelic, and henceforth the locus will be designated nimP and is defined by two alleles, nimP'9 and nimP22. Future studies will be directed at understanding the molecular basis for differences in the cell cyle arrest points of nimP mutant alleles.

Age Delineation of Glacial Deposits that Diverted Lycoming Creek to the Present Course at Powys, Lycoming County ; Pennsylvania.- The Cogan Station quadrangle surficial geology map shows deposits of the Late Wisconsinan (20,000 KA) age glacial terminus block- ing the preglacial course of Lycoming Creek. The age of this terminus is problematic because it requires an excep- tionally long and low-gradient tongue of ice extending down the Lycoming Creek valley from the adjacent parts of the Late Wisconsinan terminus. Field mapping, soils interpretation, seismic profiling and comparison with nearby ice terminus position were done to better determine the age of the blockage. The degree of erosional dissection of the head of outwash deposits was considerably greater than other such Late Wisconsinan deposits. Also the degree of clast weathering and rubification was more similar to Late Illinoian deposits rather than Late Wisconsinan deposits. The degree of erosion, weathering and relative position of the terminus all support a Late Illinoian (150,000 KA) age for the deposits blocking the preglacial Lycoming Creek valley.

Neural Responses of Hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) to Polysaccharide Taste Stimuli, - "Sweet" taste in mammals is usually associated with simple sugars and a few artificial substances. Our research addressed the hypothesis that small to very large glucose polymers may be important gustatory stimuli to hamsters. We measured the response of the whole chorda tympani nerve to glucose, maltose, sucrose, Polycose, and glycogen. Polycose is a mixture consisting primarily of maltooligosaccharides and maltopolysaccharides. All five stimuli elicited measureable responses with a relative stimu- latory potency of glycogen &gt; sucrose &gt; Polycose &gt; glucose &gt; maltose. We found extensive neural cross- adaption between Polycose and glycogen suggesting gust- atory similarities. Behavioral conditioned taste aversion of hamsters to 10% Polycose generalized to 3.2% glycogen but not to sucrose or maltose. We feel that the similarities be- tween Polycose and glycogen were due to the presence of glucose polymers. Chemical analyses of our glycogen reagent, however, showed that some of glycogen's quality could be attributed to salt contamination. We conclude that larger saccharides may play a role in the foraging behavior of rodents that can taste them. Reif, Charles, Wilkes University, Wilkes-Barre, PA 18766. Flora of a Periodic Endogenous Riverine Island.- -A riparian island which has been charted for more than a cen- tury, located in the North Branch of the Susquehanna River between Kingston and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania is peri- odically inundated. During the times of its emergence the island supports growths of three kinds of disfigured trees typical of riparian habitats, two kinds of grasses, one kind of grape vine, and seventeen kinds of forbs. During spring break-ups the island's flora is subjected to mechanical abra- sion by transient blocks of ice. The surface of the island is covered with cobble stones, gravel of various sizes, and sand. No soil profile has been recognized but the terrane is considered to be a wetland. Birds visit the island but no mammal has been found. Examination of probably psam- mon has not been attempted.

Sum- mer Diatom Floras of Agriculturally Impacted Streams in Lancaster County, PA. - In June-July 1993 we surveyed the diatoms of selected streams in the Conestoga, Pequea and Fishing Creek watersheds, sampling the assemblages colon- izing raised glass surfaces for 3 and/or 6 weeks. Little Con- estoga Creek and Fishing Creek were sampled at a series of stations from source to mouth; three other streams were sampled less intensively. Chemical ranges (and medians) in these streams were: Conductivity 48-690 micromhos/cm (510), alkalinity 10-282 mg/1 CaC03 (156), nitrate 0.5- 12.9 mg/1 (7.0), orthophosphate 0-1.04 mg/1 (.05). The following taxa occurred in at least 65% of the 24 samples: Cocconeis placentula, Navícula cryptocephala, N. radiosa, N. viridula, Nitzschia palea, Gomphonema parvulum, Achnanthes lanceolata, and Amphora sp. All these taxa exceeded 10% of the count in at least one sample. Coc- conies placentula was the most frequent dominant, exceed- ing 10% in 16 samples and exceeding 20% in 7 samples. Other taxa frequently exceeding 10% were Nitzschia palea, Navícula cryptocephala and Melosira varions. Rogers, Jenny S. and Ann F.

A Survey of Beech Scale Populations in Southeastern Pennsylvania . - Infestations of beech scale, Cryptococcus fagisuga, predispose both native and ornamental beech trees, Fagus grandifolia and Fagus sylvatica cultivars, to beech bark disease, a fatal fungal infection caused by Nectria species. Beech bark disease has been a problem in the forests of northern Pennsylvania since 1958, but has never been documented in the Delaware Valley. Recently, incidences of scale infestation have been identified in two counties in southeastern Pennsylvania. A survey, conducted in the fall of 1993, showed that the advancing front of the scale infestation has reached the Philadelphia area. Both native stands of Fagus grandifolia and ornamental Fagus sylvatica cultivars were surveyed for scale infestation and signs of infection by Nectria species. Rupprecht, Jennifer D.* and Robert M.

Preliminary Analysis of the Genome Size of the Fishes Poeciliopsis Using Flow Cytometry. - Genome size can vary greatly within a group of related species, or within the same species. We investigated interspecific and intraspecific variation in genome size among the fishes Poeciliopsis monacha and P. lucida , as well as intraclonal variation in their parthenogenic triploid hybrid, P. monacha-2 lucida, using flow cytometry. We were particularly interested in possible deviations in the actual genome size of the triploids from the anticipated genome size. We found that the genome size of P. monacha and P. lucida differed by 6% (1.46 pg versus 1.37 pg, respectively) and that there was 3% intraspecific variation within P. monacha populations. However, even with this slight variation in one of the paren- tal species, we observed no significant variation among triploids. We did observe a smaller genome of 2.02 pg in the troploids rather than the calculated 2.09 pg to 2.11 pg using the observed C values of P. monacha and P. lucida. These preliminary results may be related to effects of clonal reproductive modes on genome size. Support provided by the NSF ILI Program (USE-9050888) and the PAS Undergraduate Research Fund.

Field and Laboratory Study of the Colorado Thatch Mound Ant, Formica obscuripes.- This study was undertaken to investigate the biology and ecology of the thatch mound ant, Formica obscuripes , at high altitude.</page><page sequence="47">196 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 The distribution of 98 nests was mapped at an elevation of 8400 ft. in Colorado. The dimensions, entrances, and vege- tation surrounding each mound were recorded. One exca- vated nest contained 32 wingless queens and a number of arthropods. Mound temperatures were measured. Pré- nuptial and postnuptial activities were observed, as well as multiple matings on rabbitbrush ( Chrysothamnus sp.) 13 ft. from one nest. Trails were measured and workers were observed tending aphids and galls on a variety of plants. Bears prayed on a few nests. The internal morphology and histology of workers and reproductives were examined in the laboratory by microdissection and serial sectioning. Sargent, Rachel L.* and Jeffrey A.

In Vivo Hydrolysis of S-Adenosylmethionine Induces sulA in Escherichia coli. - DNA damage in Escherichia coli in- duces coordinately regulated genes in a mechanism termed the SOS response. RecA and LexA mediate this regulation, and induction of the SOS regulon enhances, in part, exci- sion repair, site-specific recombination, and inhibition of cell division. E. coli transformed with coliphage T3 S- adenosylmethionine (SAM) hydrolase expression vectors often become filamentous, a consequence of inhibited cell division, so we tested whether this is due to induction of the SOS regulon. Because previous studies demonstrated induction of the recA and lex A genes, we assayed the response of other SOS genes (uvrA, wvrB, polB , dinBl, dinFl, ruv, wvrD, and sul A) to the in vivo hydrolysis of SAM. SAMase activity induced three genes: ree A and lex A (as expected) and sul A (enhanced 3.3-fold over control). Since sul A encodes the cell division inhibitory activity of the SOS responses, we plan to explore its role in SAM depletion-related cell filamentation. Schmidt, Michael J* and A.R.

Nonpoint Water Pollution in Rock Creek (Adams County ; PA) and Its Tributaries.- Tests designed to measure water quality were performed at the beginning and end of a ten-year period. Four test sites were selected for their accessibility and proximity to farm lands. Chemical, physical and biological tests were conducted to determine whether nonpoint pollution was affecting water quality. Additionally, surveying of macroinvertebrates was initiated in the latter part of the ten-year period allowing for further comparison with chemical data. During the ten- year period, changes in agricultural practices on surround- ing farm lands have been documented. Concomitant with these changes, data indicate that levels of nitrates and phosphates have been reduced. Decreases in these nutrients, often associated with stream degradation and eutrophica- tion, resulted in an improvement in water quality over the ten-year period and can be attributed to the implementa- tion of best management practices (BMPs) on these agricultural lands.

The Aged in Pennsylvania: Growth and the Components of Change , 1980-1990,- This paper examines the distribution and growth of the aged population dur- ing the 1980-decade, studies the components of change (mortality and migration), and compares aged growth to that of the general population of Pennsylvania. Aged inhabitants by residential type and aged institutional population (essentially those in nursing homes) are ana- lyzed to determine what role these characteristics play in the cohort's recent geographic trends. Results indicate that aged growth occurred in a variety of circumstances - inurban, suburban, and rural counties, as well as in metropolitan counties and those in remote sites with few residents. Leading counties in terms of percentage gains of the elderly population are found mostly in the eastern part of the state, often in counties best described as pleasant places in which to live. These include recreation/ retirement centers in the Poconos, suburbs in the Phila- delphia and Harrisburg regions* and counties in the Sus- quehanna Valley north of the capital, among others.

Nucleotide Diversity and Genetic Markers Within Bacterial Populations. - Nucleotide diversity within three lotie populations of Janthinobacterium lividum was estimated using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The same analysis was used to search for species- and population-specific genetic markers for this microorganism. Chromosomal DNA from J. lividum iso- lates was digested with six restriction endonucleases and probed with a 7.5 kb pKK3535 fragment containing the E. coli rrnB rRNA operon. Putative clonemates were not pres- ent within the three group method using arithmetic aver- ages (UPGMA) dendrogram illustrates J. lividum popula- tions as distinct genetic clusters. Genetic markers were found for each population and for the total group of iso- lates. The population-specific markers may be useful in monitoring the movement of bacteria between populations. The species-specific markers may facilitate the identifica- tion of J. lividum. Schueller, Sheila K* and Richard A.

The Effect of Intergametophytic Competition on Pollen Performance in Mirabilis jalapa. - There have been few quantitative in vivo investigations of the effect of the number of competing pollen grains on pollen competitive ability. We examined these intergametophytic effects while keeping constant the other factors known to influence pollen performance such as maternal plant, pollen genotype, and paternal environment. The single-ovulate, self- compatible flowers of Mirabilis jalapa were self pollinated</page><page sequence="48">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 197 with varying numbers of pollen grains. Pollen germination and pollen tube growth rates were then measured using U V microscopy. Significant interactions occurred between grow- ing pollen tubes within a stigma or style. When many pollen grains were deposited on a stigma, a lower percentage of their tubes penetrated the style as compared to lower pollen loads. The influential effect of competitive environment, as defined by the number of competing pollen tubes within a stigma or style, on pollen tube growth rate has important implications with respect to our understanding of interactions between developing pollen tubes, pollen tube competition, and non- random mating in plants.

Characterization and Sequence Determination of the Long Terminal Repeat of Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus from a Chemically Induced Tumor. - Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) is a retrovirus which is endogenous in inbred strains of laboratory mice. A carcinogen-induced mammary tumor which arose in a BALB/c mouse (a low mammary tumor incidence strain), displayed a new copy of MMTV proviral DNA in tumor cells. In order to determine the origin of the new provirus, the long terminal repeat region was sequenced. The acquired provirus shows significant sequence homology to the endogenous proviruses Mtv-8 and Mtv-9. A short sequence (-100 bp), corresponding to a critical variable region of an encoded protein respon- sible for shaping the immune repertoire is different from all three endogenous proviruses (Mtv-6, 8 &amp; 9) and other known MMTV's. The specificity for interaction with host T cell receptors is predicted to be unique based on LTR sequence determination. The combination of homology to endogenous sequences with a unique variable segment sug- gests a recombinant origin for the new provirus. Shea, Neil M., Kutztown University, Kutztown, PA 19530. A Simple Computer Model to Demonstrate Electronic Band Structure in Solids. - Schrodinger's equation was solved for various numbers (1 to 7) of sinusoidal potential wells in close proximity and the energies of the eigenfunc- tions were compared to the energies of the eigenfunctions for a single well. As the wells are combined, the energy levels of the individual wells split into several energy levels form- ing a band structure. The band theory of solids predicts that the energy levels of an individual atom spread out into energy bands as the atoms combine to form a solid. Shea, Neil M., Kutztown University, Kutztown, PA 19530. A Simple Computer Model to Demonstrate Quantum Mech- anically Why Atoms Combine to Form a Solid. - Several BASIC computer programs were written which solve Schrodinger's equation for multi-potential well systems (1 well up to 7 wells). An individual well (sinusoidal well) repre- sents an atom with one valence electron in it. The energy of its ground state eigenfunction is numerically determined using a Runge-Kutta-Nystrom solution. This energy value is then compared to the ground state eigenfunctions for various combinations of wells in close proximity. For a given number of wells, the ground state energy of the wells in combination is less than the ground state energy of the separated wells. Quantum mechanically, atoms can combine to form a solid if the energy of the solid system is less than the sum of the energies of the separate atoms. Simmons, Jennifer* and Jeffrey A.

Further Studies on Enhancing Export of 5'-Methylthioribose From Escherichia coli Upon In Vivo Hydrolysis of S-Adenosyl- methionine . - 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) is produced from S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) and then hydrolyzed to form 5-methylthioribose (MTR) and adenine in many organisms. Adenine is recycled, but E. coli apparently exports most or all of the resulting MTR. SAM hydrolase (SAMase) mediated in vivo hydrolysis of SAM induces expression of SAM synthetase, hence more SAM, presumably then yielding large quantities of both MTA and MTR. Cells with SAMase activity grown with C3H3-methionine produce over three times as much of a labeled cis-diol containing reduc- ing sugar that migrates with MTR in paper chromatography than cells lacking this activity, and preliminary analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy suggest it is MTR. This confirms MTR's routine export by E. coli and quantifies its enhanced export due to the effects of SAMase activity, suggesting new experiments to better characterize and further enhance MTR's export.

Cosson. - Rapid-Cycling B. juncea (RCBJ) seeds were obtained from the Crucifer Gen- etics Cooperative and grown under artificial light condi- tions. Collections of whole flowers began after two weeks of growth and they were fixed in FPA50 for a minimum of 24 hours then transferred to 70% Ethyl Alcohol. Whole flowers were cleared in 4)4 clearing fluid and ovules were dissected from the bicarpelate ovary for phase contrast microscopic investigation of ontogenetic events. After seed- set, voucher specimens were prepared for the YCP Herb- arium. When RCBJ reaches a campylotropous ovule shape, one spiral vessel grows from the placenta through the funiculus. The ovule has an asymmetrical bitegmic condi- tion which encloses a tenuinucellate nucellus. The nucellus contains multiple archesporial cells which enlarge as though they might undergo meiosis. Only one cell com- pletes mieosis and megasporogenesis results in one spore, the chalazal, becoming the megagametophyte. The embryo- sac has three antipodals, two polar bodies, two synergids, and an egg-Polygonum Development.

Cellular and Molecular Characterization of</page><page sequence="49">198 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 Bluetongue Virus Infection. - Bluetongue virus is a mem- ber of the Reovirus family. The virus infects sheep, cows, and many other ruminants. Most viruses that infect a host cell lead to the destruction of the cell by a distinct cell death process known as necrosis. An alternative cell death pattern, known as apoptosis, occurs in other situations, including lymphocytes programmed to die, neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and many other cell death events, but has not been reported in any viral-infected cells. We have investigated the process of cell death when cells are infected with Bluetongue wild-type virus or non-cytopathic mutants of the virus. This was done at the cellular level by Wright Giemsa staining of infected cells and at the molecular level by isolation an characterization of genomic DNA of in- fected cells. In addition, reverse-transcription PCR is be- ing used to clone the viral proteins. The results of the morphological studies and progress on the cloning of viral proteins will be presented.

Importance of Shrews ( Insectívora : Soricidae) in Temperate Forest Small Mammal Communities. - Shrews (Mammalia: Soricidae) are important constituents of small mammal communities in forested ecosystems of the Holarctic. Shrews are not only abundant, but they frequently occur as diverse assemblages which often constitute more than 50% of the small mammal alpha diversity. Sampling of 3 deciduous forest habitats and 2 recent clearcuts in southcentral Penn- sylvania yielded 5 species of soricids including 4 species of Sorex. In samples collected during September-November 1987, 1991-93, shrews averaged 55.0% of small mammals collected annually (range 26.0 - 64.3%). The mean number of shrew species per habitat per year was 3.8 (range - 3.6 - 4.0; mode = 4). This differed significantly from the annual mean for rodents of 2.9 species per habitat (range = 2.4 - 3.2; mode = 3). A similar pattern of community structure was observed in samples of small mammals from 5 forested habitats in New Jersey, where shrews averaged 3.6 species per habitat (range = 3-5; mode = 3), compared to a mean of 3.4 species per habitat for rodents (range = 1 - 6; mode = 3). Shrews comprised 67.7% of the total sam- ple from the five habitats (range = 55.6 - 91.0%), making them the dominant component of small mammal com- munities in forested ecosystems.

The Effects of Anti-malarial Drugs on the Immunoglobulin Levels of Swiss Webster Mice In- fected with the NYU-2 Strain of Plasmodium berghei - Four groups of six animals each were used in this study. Group 1 served as the not infected/untreated control. Group 2 was the infected/untreated control. Group 3 the treated/not infected control. Group 4 was the experimen- tal group: infected and treated. Animals were infected intraperitonealy with IX 5(10) parasitized erythrocytes taken from previously infected animals. Peripheral blood films were prepared daily. When the parasitemias approached 20%, the animals were killed, blood taken via cardiac puncture, and the serum separated by centrifugation. The serum samples were subsequently analyzed using the capture antibody elisa method. The results were subjected to analysis of varience. Significant changes in IgM levels were noted.

Analysis of Winter Flounder Popula- tion Structure Using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA. -Winter flounder, a valuable fish to both sport and com- mercial fishermen, returns to natal estuaries along the north- eastern seaboard to spawn. If fish returned strictly to their natal waters, slight genetic distinctions between populations would be expected. This characteristic would be expected to be prominent in the offshore population at Georges Bank, where these fish are morphologically different, sporting a darker color and larger size. Using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) we examined eleven onshore populations and the offshore population at Georges Bank for genetic variation, particularly looking at those from the greatest geographical distance. Each RAPD banding pattern type was assigned a genotype, and each individual was described by a compiled genotype determined from the pat- terns of all primers examined. There was as much variation found within populations as between populations; the statistical analysis supports the previous mitochondrial DNA studies which indicate that there is no significant genetic distinctness among any population.

Gel Electrophoresis: Inherent Variability in Base Pair Estimates. - Restriction fragment length poly- morphism (RFLP) analysis commonly involves the com- parison of bands from two or more agarose gels. Accurate comparisons are crucial for the estimation of genetic par- ameters, such as nucleotide diversity, because estimates are a function of the number of fragments in common among isolates. One focus of this study was to determine the amount of variability present in base pair estimates of identical fragments. Another focus was to determine, in the case of broad bands, which section of a band (front, center or back) provides the best estimate of fragment size. Our data indicate that variability in base pair estimates is</page><page sequence="50">SUPPLEMENT AND INDEX ISSUE 199 minimal among gels unless the migration pattern of mol- ecular weight standards is distorted. Data also indicate that the leading edge (front) of a band is less variable in migra- tion distance and provides a better estimate of fragment size than other sections of the band.

Avian Distribution, Abundance, and Move- ment Over Near-shore Waters East of Cape May County, New Jersey . - Seabird and water fronts defined by temperature were studied in near-shore continental shelf waters from shore to 50 km off shore. Frontal activity was meager throughout the summer, but when present, fronts primarily occurred in July and August. Laughing Gulls (Larus atricilla ) and Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) were recorded throughout the study area. Wilson's Storm-Petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) were regular within 5 km of shore, but most occurred at distances greater than 10 km. Cory's (Calonectris diomedea) and Greater (Puffinus gravis ) Shearwaters were recorded beyond 30 km. Great Black- backed (L. marinus) and Herring (L. argentatus) Gulls were only found within 10 km of shore. Select species movements were studied in relation to time of day. These near-shore waters are intense commercial and recreational areas. The species, their numbers, and their activity provide baseline data as one source of determining and assessing the con- sequences of a toxic spill or other environmental disaster in this sensitive area.

Ecological Analysis of the Little Lehigh Creek- Water quality of freshwater bodies is of increasing environmen- tal concern. Chemical, physical, and biological properties characterize each ecosystem. The Little Lehigh Creek is such an ecosystem which meanders through farm and park lands of Lehigh County in eastern Pennsylvania. The study was conducted because of the concern of farming damage, extensive corrosion, and pollution along the creek. To deter- mine the extent of damage to this creek, baseline data was compiled. Twenty-eight locations were monitored regularly from May to August 1993 to understand the normal pat- terns of the creek. This data was analyzed to evaluate the creek and instill programs to educate and increase the water quality of the Little Lehigh Creek.

Lyme Detection by PCR in Ixodes scapularis. - About 10-15% of collected Ixodes scapularis ( = I. dammini ), the Lyme borreliosis vector in Pennsyl- vania, are reported to carry Borrelia burgdorferi. Determin- ing whether a tick is infected is necessary for tracking the spread of Lyme and for the risk-treatment assessment for a tick-bitten individual. Using the Polymerase Chain Reac- tion (PCR), 18 alcohol-preserved Lyme ticks (17 male and 1 female) were tested for Borrelia burgdorferi . PCR reaction conditions were optimized to provide a sensitivity below one femtogram of DNA: 30pmol primer, 6mM Mg+2, 50 cycles (95° for 60sec, 40° for 30sec, 60° for 60sec), and over 400-fold dilution of tick supernatant (to dilute PCR inhib- itors). Only the female tick tested positive for Borrelia burg- dorferi . Advantages of using PCR for Lyme diagnosis in- clude speed, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, many ticks can be preserved together in alcohol for long periods of time prior to analysis with no cross-contamination. Tanczyn, R.*, Kutztown University, Kutztown, PA 19530 and G.

Magnetic Moment Measurements of Excited Nuclear States in *6Zr- One of the fundamental properties of the atomic nucleus is the magnetic dipole moment. Measurements of magnetic moments have proven to be useful in the under- standing of nuclear structure and in the validating of nu- clear models. This work focuses on the determination of magnetic moments of short-lived (picosecond) excited nuclear states through the interaction of the moments with the "transient" magnetic field which acts on the excited nucleus as it traverses a thin polarized ferromagnet. The excited states are produced through an interaction with accelerated heavy-ion beams. The magnetic moments are determined by observing the gamma-rays emitted from the excited nucleus after it exits the ferromagnet. In a recent experiment, excited states in 86Zr were popu- lated in a 12C(77Se,3n) reaction at 260 MeV. The results of this experiment as well as an overview of the experimental technique will be presented.

Spatial Variability of Redness in the Munsell Soil Color Space.- The color of soil is usually determined by visual comparison with 244 colored chips in the Munsell soil color chart. Each chip is arranged in three-dimensional space according to the cylindrical coordinates of hue (//), value ( V ), and chroma (Q. Soils research has employed empirical redness indices based on combinations of these variables in order to quantify soil color. I determined how redness varies within the Munsell soil color space by first expressing redness in terms of the index [log (C/HV)]. Next, I converted the cylindrical coordinates of each color chip into rectangular coordinates using simple trigono- metric relationships and then calculated the Euclidean distance between all 29,646 pairs of chips. Finally, I esti- mated spatial variability by calculating the variance in redness of those pairs of chips falling within 32 different distance classes and then constructing a variogram. The results demonstrate that redness is spatially correlated everywhere in the color space and is also directionally dependent (anisotropic). Additional research is needed to determine if other redness indices behave similarly.</page><page sequence="51">200 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 Tarutis, William J., Jr., Kenneth M.

A Survey of Water Quality in Acid Mine Drainage Streams of Wyoming Valley ; Penn- sylvania- -The drainages from anthracite coal mines and overburden piles (culm banks) in northeastern Pennsyl- vania are major sources of metals and acidity in the water- shed of the Susquehanna River. A survey of water quality in the acid mine drainage seeps and streams of greater Wilkes-Barre (Wyoming Valley), Pennsylvania, was ini- tiated to update existing data and establish a regional chemical database to be used in future studies. The initial survey included analysis of pH, redox potential, specific conductance, total iron, and sulfate; subsequent studies included additional chemical parameters. The drainages examined thus far are moderately (pH « 5) to very acidic (pH &lt; 3) and discharge large amounts of iron and sulfate (as high as several tons per year) into local streams, resulting in the formation of ochreous precipitates commonly ob- served along local streams. The results demonstrate that even after more than thirty years since coal mining ceas- ed, acid mine drainage in the Wyoming Valley is widespread and is still a significant source of pollutants.

Estimation of Acid Mine Drainage Impact on Streams Using Conductance Measure- ments . - Acid mine drainage (AMD) is characterized by high metal (particularly iron and manganese) and sulfate concentrations, high conductance, and low pH. In an effort to estimate AMD impact on streams in greater Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania, the empirical relationship between specific conductance and sulfate concentration was exam- ined on natural AMD samples as well as synthetic prepara- tions consisting of sulfate and seven different metal cations. AMD impacts were also interpreted in terms of the more conventional approach of plotting water quality data on cation-anion trilinear diagrams. The results demonstrate that conductance measurements can be a useful screening tool for evaluating AMD impact on streams, provided that the predominant anion is sulfate and dilution from runoff and contamination from other ions, such as from road salt, are minimal.

Effect of Alkyl Alcohols as Brainstem Neuron Anesthetics. - We investigated the effect of alkyl alcohols on the medullary pacemaker nu- cleus of the weakly electric fish Eigenmannia virescens (transparent knife fish). This cluster of neurons controls the electric organ discharge (EOD). The EOD was recorded extracellularly from freely-swimming fish. We studied the action of ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, nonanol, and decanol. In each case, the n-alkyl form was used and the concentration was 50 ppm. Maximum effect is achieved with octanol, and degree of anesthesia falls off as chain length decreases or increases from the 8-carbon compound. Ethanol has no effect while octanol produces an EOD decrement of 40-50% in 10-15 min. When the fish is placed in a recovery tank, the EOD returns to 90-100% of its initial state in 10 min. Chain length and lipophilic character seem to determine degree of anesthetic potency. Supported in part by Howard Hughes Medical Institute/ Ursinus College Summer Grant . Thomulka, K.W., J.A.

Effect of Treatment of Sand with EDTA and SDS before assay with the Vibrio harveyi Bioluminescence-reduction Assay on Metal Toxicity. - Having previously developed a bioluminescence reduction bioassay to detect toxic materials in water using the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi , we wished to determine if this assay could detect the presence of toxic metallic compounds in sand. Beach sand spiked with 22 different metals tightly bound most metals and toxicity could not be detected. Sodium dodecylsulfate treatment was able to remove six of the metals (arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, strontium, zinc) and demonstrate their toxicity. To increase assay specificity, treatment with EDTA, a metal chelating agent, was con- ducted. Twenty four different metals were tested in aqueous solution. Eight had their toxicity reduced by EDTA. These results suggest that if toxicity is reduced by EDTA, one of these eight metals is involved. Studies are being conducted to determine if sand spiked with these eight metallic com- pounds will also demonstrate toxicity which is reduced by EDTA treatment. Preliminary results indicate that only mercury has its toxicity reduced by EDTA treatment. Tipping, John M.*, Renée Fisher and William E.

A Study of Proteins of Nest Material of the Bald-faced Hornet (Vespula maculata) and the Yellow Jacket (V. maculifrons). - Many social wasps fabricate nests made of macerated wood fibers combined with saliva into a paper. Nest material and sawdust was extracted and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel elec- trophoresis. Nest materials were shown to contain discrete protein bands while the putative source material, sawdust, did not. While there was high variability, the nest materials of both insects showed a series of protein bands of high molecular weight (about 100 kd) and intermediate molec- ular weight (30-50 kd).

To date, research on this phenomenon has been based primarily on data from observation points on the Kittatinny Ridge (North Mountain). In this study migrating raptors were censused on 5 ridges extending from North Mountain (Cumberland County) northwest to Bald Eagle Mountain (Centre County). The numbers of migrating raptors re- corded from North Mountain were compared to numbers observed from the other ridges. Wind speed and direction along with other meteorological factors were examined to determine if they had any effect on the ridge selection by the migrating birds. Twenty thousand eight hundred eighty- five (20,885) birds representing 14 species of diurnal rap- tors were observed during this study of which 49.7% were from North Mountain. The data solely from North Moun- tain underestimates the total number of birds migrating. Varma, Madan M.*, Department of Physical Sciences, Kutz- town University of Pennsylvania, Kutztown, PA 19530. Geological and Geophysical Techniques Applied in Groundwater Pollution Studies- Recently there has been a greater emphasis on environmental issues and finally mankind is realizing that we may be the agents of our own destruction, if we do not learn to manage planet Earth. Clean water plays a very important role in sustaining life. Detection of pollutants in groundwater by geological and geophysical techniques is increasingly being used and new methods are being developed. In this paper, various classical and new geological and geophysical methods are discussed and a framework for collecting and interpreting data is explained. The classical geological methods discussed are subsurface soil investiga- tion and soil gas surveys and in surface geophysics elec- trical, magnetic and seismic refraction, in sub-surface geophysics various borehold logs such as electric, natural gamma, gamma-gamma and neutron logs. The new methods explained are Electromagnetic and Ground Penetrating Radar Method. A typical case study of an area is also illus- trated which utilizes several of the above described methods.

Variation in Self-Incompatibility in Campanula rapunculoides. - Pre- vious studies have shown that although self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetic trait, it may be influenced by environmen- tal factors. The current study examines the influence of prior fruit set and floral age on SI in C. rapunculoides. Eight plants from a natural population were vegetatively propagated yielding 6-8 replicate clones. The lower 2/3 of the inflorescences were either fully pollinated (Fruit treat- ment), or the styles were removed (Non-Fruit treatment). Seed data from controlled pollinations on the upper 1 /3 of each inflorescence revealed that the expression and break- down of SI is more dependant on plant genotype and prior fruit set than floral age. For those plants exhibiting variable expression of SI, significantly more selfed seeds were set in plants with no prior fruits than in fruit bearing ones. Voss, Vannessa* and Robert M.

Ill Evolution Within Populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura . - Although genome size can vary widely among closely related species, it has been assumed until recently to be constant within species. In this study we compared DNA content among ten populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura . Two-way analysis of variance showed significant differences among populations (P &lt;.0001) and among sexes (P &lt;.0001), as well as a significant sex-species interaction. Much of the dif- ferences among populations result from differences in the amount of DNA accumulated on the Y chromosome. This fits with current views of the Y chromosome as a dump- ing ground for transposable elements and other forms of selfish DNA.

Nucleolar Organizer Region (NOR) and Nucleolar Variation in Human Amniocytes. - Silver staining (AgNOR) and in situ hybridization were used to study variation in the nucleolar organizer region (NOR) and in the nucleolar size and shape in human amniocytes. In rapidly proliferating cultures, numerous bizarre-shaped nucleoli were observed in each nuclei. These nuclei differed from those of more slowly growing cultures which were typi- cally single and circular. In the rapidly proliferating cul- tures, it was possible to observe the arrangement of the NOR in cells in prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Wahida, Mostafa T.* and CR.

Studies on the Digestive Enzymes of Darlingtonia california- The cobra lily ( Darlingtonia california) is a car- nivorous plant that captures insects in tubular leaves with a uniquely curved hood structure and forked, tongue-like appendages with nectaries. The species is native to northern California. The presence of digestive enzymes in pitcher fluid has been demonstrated in other carnivorous plants, however pitcher fluid is not observed in the cobra lily. The absence of pitcher fluid does not exclude the possibility that Darlingtonia may possess enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of its prey. The presence of digestive enzymes can be demonstrated by assaying tissues for protease activ- ity. This presentation will describe the results of protease activity assays for leaves (pitchers) containing prey items. Walters, Gary L.* and Charles E.

Demog- raphy of Seedlings of Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum) and Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) in Riparian Forests of the</page><page sequence="53">202 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 Allegheny River.- The upper Allegheny River in north- western Pennsylvania was dammed in 1967, altering historic hydrologie regimes. In many North American river systems, maintenance of riparian forests is closely linked to hydro- logic regime and damming often results in community col- lapse. As part of a larger study addressing the maintenance of Allegheny River riparian forests, we examined the estab- lishment and recruitment dynamics of seedlings of the dominant forest trees, Acer saccharinum and Platanus occidentalis . Acer saccharinum colonized river cobble and island terrace habitats at nearly the same rate (52% and 48% occurrence respectively), whereas P. occidentalis only colonized river cobble. Ninety-three percent of the seedl- ings of both species were newly established, the remainder ranged from 2 to 6 years in age. Overall seedling mortality through early autumn was low (9.5%) and concentrated in river cobble habitat.

Popu- lation Genetics of Xanthine Dehydrogenase Activity in Drosophila melanogaster.-A natural population genetics study of the rosy-x anthine dehydrogenase (XDH) system in Drosophila melanogaster was initiated to evaluate the relative contribution of regulatory and structural genetic effects to XDH activity variation. Assays were performed on 49 isogenic lines for three functional domain-specific XDH activities (xanthine:NAD + , xanthine:cytochrome C, and xanthine:phenazine methosulfate oxidoreductase activi- ties), followed by quantitation of XDH molecules using rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Rocket height is significantly correlated with XDH activity in two functional domains. Analysis of variance supports significant line differences in rocket height. Analyses of covariance using rocket height as a covariate indicate that genetic variation exists for XDH activity in two functional domains. These results suggest that line differences in enzyme activities cannot be ex- plained by quantity of XDH molecules alone. Way, Patricia A., Jonathan M. Brown and Warren G.

The Effects of an Herbivore Host- plant Shift on the Parasitoid Eurytoma gigantea Walsh (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae).-^Yhe gallmaker, Eurosta solidaginis Fitch (Diptera: Tephriditae), is a host-plant specialist that attacks Solidago altissima (Compositae) throughout the plant's range. Across northern regions, E. solidaginis also infests S. gigantea . Since a gall pheno- type results from the interaction of the gallmaker's geno- type and the host-plant genotype, a shift to a new host-plant results in a new gall phenotype, which in turn can influence enemy attack. The parasitoid, E. gigantea , attacks Eurosta after complete gall formation and is therefore limited to attacking smaller galls by its ovipositor length. Galls on S. gigantea are significantly larger than those found on S. altissima . We tested the prediction that shifting to S. gigantea would result in less parasitism from E. gigantea due to ovipositor limitations. Attack rates of E. gigantea determined from 8 Great Lakes and 23 New England popu- lations did not differ between host races. Behavioral obser- vations demonstrated that E. gigantea does not preferen- tially search host-plants to find Eurosta . Thus, the gall- maker has not escaped this parasitoid during its host shift.

Analysis of the Woody Vegetation of the Future Site of the Rodale Cycling and Fitness Center. -The woody vegetation of the future site for the Rodale Cycling and Fitness Center was studied to disclose baseline information. This 71 acre woodlot is located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania and will become a family-oriented recreation and nature center. To determine the various characteristics of the woody flora, three series of point-quarter quadrants were con- ducted in three different areas. Pinus strobus dominated the North and South sections while Juglans nigra domi- nated the West section. From the eighteen reference points, evaluated by four quarters per point, determinations were made of relative frequency, relative dominance, relative density and importance value. The statistical analysis indicates that the area is typical for secondary growth upland hardwood, secondary growth wetland, and an aging pine plantation. Wetzel, Nancy J.* and Alan B.

Rapid Screening Protocols for Population Studies of Janthino - bacterium lividum.-Janthinobacterium lividum is currently the focus of a geographic study on a bacterial metapopula- tion within eastern Pennsylvania. Accurate identification of this species is necessary before genetic analyses can be conducted. The purpose of this study was to develop a set of screening protocols which would allow rapid identifica- tion of J. lividum from numerous field samples. J. lividum is a gram-negative, strictly aerobic bacterium which is found in soil and water. A set of protocols, including spec- trophotometric screening for violacein, tests of aesculin hydrolysis and chloroform solubility, and screening for anti- biotic resistance, provides a reliable approach to the identifi- cation of this bacterium. The use of DNA probes for the identification of J. lividum is currently being investigated. Williams, Kimberly* and Fred J. Brenner, Grove City Col- lege, Grove City, PA 16127. The Evaluation of Vegetative Changes Associated with a Rotational Grazing System - Plant community characteristics were analyzed in a rota- tional grazing program system located in Mercer County, PA. The amount of biomass and area coverage in the seven paddocks was analyzed using a disc meter and a m2 grid, respectively. Overall, the disc height was correlated with biomass and area coverage, and the mean area coverage of the paddocks did increase from the spring to fall period.

Woody Plant Communities on Sand Bar Islands in the Susque- hanna River. - Sand bar islands are common in the lower Susquehanna River in Lancaster County, PA. These ephe- meral land forms are constantly sculptured by flooding which results in the cutting of new and the filling of existing channels; this is reflected in the pattern of woody vegeta- tion. The interior of these woody plant communities was assessed using the point quarter method and the gradients of vegetation at the edges were evaluated using transects normal and parallel to the island edges. Acer saccharinium dominated the edges and was present in interior galleries which defined the locations of old channels. The woody plant community of the island interior differed markedly from upland communities in the region, despite the large size of these islands. Robinia pseudoacacia and acer neg- undo were dominant species in the interior of the island and Salix nigra was abundant in both the edges and interior.

Effect of Cocaine on Central Neurons in Weakly Electric Fish.- The local anesthetic cocaine hydrochloride was studied for its effects on the medullary pacemaker nucleus of the trans- parent knife fish ( Eigenmannia virescens). Neurons in the pacemaker nucleus are electrically coupled and fire syn- chronously to drive the electric organ discharge (EOD) fre- quency in weakly electric fish. We studied the effect of cocaine (5xl0-5M) on the time course of EOD decrement. The fish is confined to a plexiglas tube and the EOD is recorded extracellularly with graphite electrodes; the temp- erature was maintained at 28C. In control solutions (deion- ized water), the EOD frequency is not affected by shifting the pH from 6.0 to 9.5. Cocaine (5xlO-5M) at pH 6.0 has no effect on EOD frequency, whereas at pH 9.5 it produces 30-40% decrement in EOD frequency in 20 minutes. (Local anesthetics have a pK of 8-9; at pH 6.0 cocaine exists primarily in the charged form; at pH 9.5 cocaine exists primarily in the uncharged form). When placed in a recov- ery tank (deoionized water) the fish show 80-90% recovery of EOD in 30 minutes. Unlike other local anesthetics we have studied (tetracaine, dibucaine, bupivacaine, prilo- caine), cocaine exhibits a small (5%) recovery after 10-15 minutes in the drug solution which lasts for 5 minutes and then EOD frequency begins to drop again. Perhaps the fish has begun to metabolize the drug sufficiently to lower its concentration in brain tissue. Supported in part by an Ursinus College Van Sant Grant.

Paradigm Pioneers : A Curriculum Delivery System Employing the Student as a Manager of Information- If one considers the current rate at which new information is being generated and then considers the educational proc- ess in light of the educational requirements for the techno- logical society of the twenty-first century, it becomes obvious that our current educational system will not meet the changing societal needs in an evolving society. Twenty- first century society must be capable of managing, not memorizing information! This society must be able to understand and utilize the competencies identified in the 1991 SCANS Report for the Workplace. We have therefore developed a training model through which teachers be- come facilitators of learning. The focus of our training model has been to develop a delivery system for courses taught at the secondary level. Our model is not concerned with course content but with the delivery of course content. The participants in our training are becoming paradigm pioneers. They are developing an alternative mode of deliv- ery to the classical "lecture" format. The components of our model include: the development of Performance Based Objectives; the development of Critical Thinking, Student Centered Discussion; the application of Writing Across the Curriculum; the development of Integrated Skills Exercises; and the development, within the discipline, of study skills. Through our presentation we will explain our training model, a model through which ownership of the curric- ulum becomes that of the teacher. We will also discuss how our training has also resulted in developing the future "trainers of the trainers". In summary, through our train- ing model we have developed paradigm pioneers, teachers brave enough to approach certain aspects of education from within the system. Therefore, we are developing the future trainers of the trainers. Zimmerman, K.J., D. Baker and PJ. Padgett, Department of Biology, Shippensburg University, Shippensburg, PA 17257. Effects of Moderate Exercise on the Immune Sys- tem. - Exercise in moderate amounts improves cardiovascu- lar fitness, muscle tone and helps in weight control. Exercise also has an effect on the immune system. Moderate amounts of exercise can enhance the immune system, whereas ex- haustive amounts can suppress the immune system. Rats were started on an exercise program, three days per week for fifteen minutes each day. Over the course of six weeks, their swimming time was increased to thirty minutes, three days per week. The rats were infected with bovine serum albumin in order to elicit an immune response. Blood samples were taken throughout the training, infection and recovery stages. A blood smear was done from the samples and a differential performed. The rest of the blood was centrifuged and the resulting serum collected. The serum sample will be used in electrophoresis to determine the total antibody concentration. Zimmerman, Dr. Mel, Department of Biology, Lycoming College, Williamsport, PA 17701. Performance Evaluation of a SBR Wastewater Treatment System on a Nitrification/</page><page sequence="55">204 JOURNAL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: Vol 67, Supplement and Index Issue, 1994 Denitrification Cycle.- This project tested the efficiency of both solids and nitrogen (via nitrification and denitrifica- tion) removal of a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) waste- water treatment system produced by Cromaglass. The unit was set up to handle waste from a 275 student private school. The project consisted of two phases and reports the highest nitrogen removal rates observed when using a six hour cycle (repeated four times a day) consisting of: a) 2.5 hr. aerated fill-react period; b) 1.5 hr. anoxic period; c) 0.5 hr. rearation period; d) 1.0 hr. settle period; and, e) 0.5 hr. discharge period. Phase I (before anoxic period added) removal efficiencies of Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand (CBOD5), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Total Nitrogen (Nr) were 92.1, 86.3, and 29.7% respec- tively. With the anoxic period running during Phase II, the removal efficiencies increased to: CBOD5 = 96.2, TSS = 93.4, and Nr = 73.1% respectively. The project was funded with a Ben Franklin Grant. |The abstracts published herein have not been subjected to editorial scrutiny. *Author(s) presenting the paper.</page></plain_text>
