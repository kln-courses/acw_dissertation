<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER I appreciate the honor done me by Dr. Farber and the Editorial Com- mittee in working out the Symposium' on the principal phases of my philosophy; and I am grateful to the contributors for the interest they have shown in particular problems. I wish, also, to thank Professor Myers for assembling my bibliography. I understand that I have the opportunity to make such comments on the points raised and such elucidations of my general position as seem needed. At my age, all this is likely to be final, the more so that my outlook has been of the nature of a development aware of alternatives. A decision on a particular problem has implications for other problems; and so one sees where one is going. Realism in epistemology has consequences in ontology. In this sense, I was a systematist from the start. Mine was a time of fresh explorations in philosophy. Objective idealism was fast losing its appeal for a complex of reasons which have often been discussed. Pra-gmatism was developing as a shift of perspective and emphasis but with a somewhat careless rapture. Bergson's attack upon Cartesian rationalism and his reformulation of vitalism were rightly attracting attention. But to me his epistemology seemed sketchy, as in Matter and Memory, and his theory of evolution vitalistic and with a romantic background in metaphysics. Russell and More were laying the groundwork for their analytic procedures; and I noted their as- sumptions. The new realism was developing in this country but I could not take the path of presentationalism and the searchlight view of knowing. The alternative seemed to me that of a more mediated and referential analysis of perceiving. That was what I early called critical realism. We are concerned with physical things coordinate with ourselves and characterize them. It was within this climate of opinion that I located my problems. To be brief, I got interested in the mind-body problem, the implications of evolution, and the problem of perception. After I got a fairly clear idea of what knowing seemed to be, I took up the problem of valuation. Valuing seemed to me a quite natural operation, though its predicates did not seem descriptive. From the start I disliked Moore's terminology and his intuitionism. But I saw what he was driving at. This reaction was, I think, quite general in the United States of my day. All this was before 1 This Journal, September, 1954. 72</page><page sequence="2">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 73 the advent of logical positivism. As a realist and evolutionary materialist I found the phobia against metaphysics conditioned by Continental traditions. Logical positivism has had to work its way out from its presuppositions the hard way. I sometimes wonder whether the younger men, so well trained in mathematical logic, have a sense for a larger framework. Critical realism was so early pushed aside that it did not receive a large hearing. I have the impression that it had no impact in England. Perhaps, when the inadequacy of phenomenalism is fully realized, the need for a referential analysis of perceiving will be felt. Certainly, the purely causal approach, which ends in subjectivism, is in- complete. I take it that much of recent linguistic analysis harmonizes with the referential view of perceiving and is a welcome, positive con- tribution. While I agree with Dewey in his stress on biology and experimentation, I was opposed to his assumption that epistemology was tied in with Cartesian dualism and a "mirror-conception" of knowing, that is, re- presentationalism of the Lockian type. I took knowledge claims to be about what they purported to be about. The question of the status of evidence had to be worked out for each type. Again, I had to qualify behaviorism to include a privileged place for consciousness, as has been seen in the papers. It is curious how much iRyle resembles Dewey both in his dislike of epistemology and his neglect of the consciousness problem. Those are characteristics of extreme behaviorism. I am tempted to make comments on Russell and Moore, practically my contemporaries, but I do not have the space. It is evident that I regarded epistemology as technically very strategic for philosophy. Since, in the intellectual division of labor with science, philosophy had undertaken to investigate the nature and conditions and reach of human knowing, it had the duty to do the job well. But it had seemed to me that it had gotten off to a bad start through overstress, in empiricism, on the sensory, causal framework. The rise and control of meanings, categorial and otherwise, could not be understood from this base. Yet man is the conceptualizing animal. A prior rationalism would not do for it had to have its foundations. The result was the vacillation between subjective idealism, phenome- nalism, and objective idealism while science called for some sort of realism. Of course, there were other motives affecting philosophy as a sort of defender of man's qualities against reductive, mechanical ma- terialism. It was a complicated cultural situation. Science would keep on working and would pass from the inorganic level of nature to the organic and thence to the psychological and the social. The idea of evolution had by my time become a guiding one. Could not, then, empiricism get a more realistic foundation? It was this shift of base, this change of pre-</page><page sequence="3">74 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH suppositions, which philosophy found it so hard to make. Russell never got away from Hume; and Moore, as nearly as I can make out, stressed his realistic certitude while confining direct knowledge to the apprehension- of sense-data.2 And he has never been sure but that sense-data might be parts of the surface of physical things. The referential view of per- ceiving excludes this as a possibility. Sensations condition referential characterization but are not themselves the objects of such reference. And may I remark that I always thought of sensations as events rather than as entities after the fashion of C. D. Broad. I was very openminded as to the kind of psychology which went with this outlook. "A little more and how much it is." The American critical realist movement was founded on the effort to explore this referential vector of perceiving. The new realism followed James's effort at a radical empiricism of givenness and context. Russell's much advertised neutral monism took this point of departure. Other desperate philosophers from Vienna, ready to cut any Gordian knot, married symbolic logic to Humian sensationalism and launched themselves on a career. The added rationalization was an assumed stalemate between idealism and realism. For reasons which I shall go into later, American critical realism did not get a good philo- sophical press. An adequate epistemology can, however, only be the gateway to ontology, though an essential one. For ontology, categories are essential. These, I take it, arise empirically, within the framework of perceiving, as categorial meanings applicable to objects. I have always distinguished epistemological categories, such as truth and fact, from ontological categories, such as thinghood and causality. After all, it is rather compli- cated and one has to have a clear head. A bad epistemology leads the thinker astray on almost every issue; and even such Teutonic persistence as Carnap's does not quite compensate for it. I shall show that the in- ability to distinguish between knowing and valuing lies at the root of English intuitionism in ethics. Good is supposed to be a nonnatural property which is intuited. But it is not a property at all. It is a justifiable valuation. Now, because I started with basic problems which seemed to me solvable, I always believed that philosophy in cooperation with science could reach an intellectually satisfying position. Mere diversity did not seem to me inevitable, as, according to M. Gilson, it is assumed by this generation of American philosophers. A reformed materialism combined with humanism is likely to shock the sensibilities of many but no one should try to be a philosopher unless he has some stamina. 2 For confirmation, see A. J. Ayer, Philosophical Essays, "The Terminology of Sense-Data." and Harris, Nature, Mind and Modern Science, Ch. 15. This is why I speak of physical realism as a realistic empiricism.</page><page sequence="4">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 75 On the whole, I think the development of American philosophy in the early part of the twentieth century was a very healthy one. Both pragma- tism and realism were in close contact with science. I know that I worked out my strategic ideas in connection with a course I called The Main Concepts of Science. In this setting to challenge Cartesian dualism seemed only logical. I early asked myself how mind, as a term for functions and dispositions, and consciousness, as a term for compresent events, could be located in relation to the organism. Greatly daring, I argued that consciousness could be conceived as spatial because intrinsic to a spatial, functional system. In his History of American Philosophy, Woodbridge Riley quickly- recognized the novelty of this suggestion. Those who have read Sherrington's Man on His Nature will note his concern with this problem of spatial location. Epistemology should help here. So much in the way of general indications. But I must not impose on the kindness of Dr. Farber and take too much space by way of a general introduction to my perspective. Let me now shift to comments on the points raised by the contributors to the Symposium. For reasons which will be evident, I shall examine Dr. Bahm's points after I have taken up the more detailed questions raised by Wilfrid Sellars, Chisholm and Kuiper. If one is a physical realist one must, I take it, be either a dualist or an evolutionary materialist ready to enlarge one's notions of efficient causality to include mindedness and conduct guided by normative valuations. It was this direction which my own conception of reformed materialism took. It is the reverse of what is historically known as re- ductionism. To take such a position is to take evolution seriously. I must confess I was astonished to be told that I was not an evolutionist. MOOT POINTS AND REJOINDERS Wilfrid Sellars begins his study of physical realism with an attempt to show that the predicament into which historical conceptualism fell is the key to the understanding of both the idealistic movement and the realist reaction. Now conceptualism had set up the distinction between the esse intentionale of the immanent object, of thought and the transcendent, or actual, object of thought. But only the immanent object is given. It must, therefore, be either identical with the transcendent object or be re- presentative of it. Neither horn of the dilemma is satisfactory. The first would involve a fusion of the two; the second, an untestable claim. He then goes on to point out the difficulties into which Kant got himself, especially as regards the self. This becomes the transcendent object of acts of thought which have their own immanent object. That is, the self cannot be intuited. Hence the pressure of the above predicament applies. Thus, while Kant believed in things-in-themselves, he got himself</page><page sequence="5">76 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH shut into phenomena. The Hegelians took over by denying that anything came from outside thought. This meant the rejection of Kant's theory of the sense-manifold. They went on to refuse to draw a sharp distinction between particulars and universals and to favor the identification of the act of thought with its object as that which the act would become if fully developed, somewhat, I suppose, like Royce's inner meaning and outer meaning. Now all this shows that there was nothing arbitrary or whimsical about the development of idealism. The difficulty into which Locke fell by adopting the purely causal theory of ideas illustrates the same thesis. If, then, with the growth of science and the rise of doubt about the validity of idealistic systems, one wanted to get back to something more akin to commonsense beliefs, what would one do? Here Wilfrid Sellars concerns himself with the steps taken by Moore and Russell. I should like to add some account of developments over here. I shall have, of course, to be very brief. Moore and Russell began by making a mental act-consciousness of or awareness-terminate on something non-mental. This was a radical abandonment of the conceptualist tradition. Colors, sounds, numbers, logical relations, are all outside the circle of our ideas. Such is the his- torical origin of the emphasis upon sense-data in Moore, Russell, Broad and Price. But where do material things come in? "Sooner or later, they were bound to choose between saying that we are aware of material objects as well as colors, etc., and saying that 'material objects' do not constitute a domain additional to colors, sounds, etc." Russell first fell back on the logical form of the definite description. But it seemed too much to regard it as giving contact with entities which were never objects of awareness. Russell became increasingly a Humian and sought to construct things out of sensibilia and, then, encouraged by James's rejection of "consciousness," out of neutral entities. Hence his neutral monism. Some points of my own are added. It would seem, then, that British empiricism has not escaped from what is equivalent to phenomenalism. Physical things got a Pickwickian treatment. In the United States by the beginning of the twentieth century, what was usually called objective, speculative and absolute idealism was attacked by the pragmatists. As I recall it, the epistemology of perception was hardly touched upon except in a few references to centers of ex- perience. The Berkeleian victory over matter was largely assumed. In other words, the battle front between idealists and pragmatists was not an epistemological one. On the one side we heard of coherence, concrete universals, timelessness and the whole; on the other, of ideas as plans of action, situations, prediction, working and time. A. W. Moore's saying to the effect that the situation was the pragmatists' absolute was much</page><page sequence="6">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 77 quoted. William James pushed for a return to the British, empirical tradition, ending in radical empiricism, while Dewey moved within objective experience to studies in experimental logic, remaining critical of Lockian ideas and Cartesian dualism. Increasingly he became biologically minded, swinging to behaviorism as the time went on. It never seemed to me that he attacked the problem of perception incisively nor the question of the status of consciousness. That is why I said earlier that he did not seem to me to bite in deeply enough. C. I. Lewis was the pragmatist who sought to do this. Up to the present, he has worked with expressive, terminating statements and a conceptual a prior. To that extent he is generally regarded as belonging to the phe- nomenalistic tradition. There are some signs he is--not quite satisfied with the result. At the conclusion of his paper, Wilfrid Sellars raises some interesting points about the basis of predictive inference in this system. This is, of course, only the problem stated by Hume in a new form. If we do have knowledge about things should we not be able to use this knowledge inductively and predictively? It is an affair of growth of knowledge about. As he puts it, "To acquire empirical concepts is (in part) to learn to respond to one's environment with these concepts." And he is quite right in asserting that "At bottom, the problem is the relation of meaning to immediate experience; and we have been pointing out that the Physical Realist rejects the radical empiricist account of concept formation lock, stock and barrel." I find this insight very heartening. The positivist's conception of meaning was basically Humian and phenomenalistic. For me, meaning arises primarily within the framework of perceptual reference and, while guided by sensations, is concerned with the job of being adequate to objects. That, of course, is why perceiving is no longer simplified in the old associational way but is looked upon as an affair of pattern and conceptualization. Once this system of conceptual meanings arises, it can, of course, be extended and developed. But there are always controls and criteria. When these are violated we feel uneasy. I have said nothing about the new realism. It was essentially an attempt to arrive at a presentational realism from Hume and James by re-defini- tion. The only alternatives Montague could conceive of were this or Lockian representationalism; just as, for Russell, it became inference or logical construction. Thus the referential approach, which the critical realists worked out, did have novelty.In what did this consist? I am going to quote a few passages from Wilfrid Sellars's formulations which seem to me to express the nub of the thesis. "While our sensations mediate and control our perceptual knowledge of the physical world, this knowledge is not a second-class knowledge built on a first-class knowledge of colors, sounds, etc. Certainly, when we do make such judgments as 'I see red,' we are less likely to be mistaken (indeed, the sense in which we can</page><page sequence="7">78 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH be mistaken is not the usual sense of mistake) than when our concern is with physical objects. But it should not be assumed that thought must be less directly about that concerning which we are more liable to error." Again, "He attacked (and continues to attack) the equation of aboutness (reference) with acquaintance or given-ness." I shall not go into the complicated problem of the divergence between the essence-wing (which got most of the critical publicity, thanks to the prestige of Santayana) and my own formulation. In 1937 Strong told me he had given up essences. The problem, as I see it, was really that of the tie-in of meanings with the referential framework. I took them more as developed concepts operating in this setting. Drake was a panpsychist, who stressed sentiency and rejected emergence. Santayana was an epiphenomenalist. For both, then, essences had a status as a prehended datum. Yet they were essentially possibilities. In contrast, I was a believer in empirically developed meanings used in what I called knowledge-claims. In perceiving, these claims arise quickly and quasi automatically. Only when there is reference, aboutness, is there -perception. I can close this phase of the discussion by admitting that it is, in one sense, wrong to talk about reconstructing perceptual judgments. To say that this cloth is green under standard conditions is just so to charac- terize it. And there is no alternative. But we must remember that so characterizing it is, for the critical realist, not the same as holding that perceiving is an intuiting of the surface of the cloth, as the naive realist tends to regard it. The assignment of shape, size and texture has much the same basis. No characteristics are intuited on the object, so to speak. They are guidedly assigned. What, then, does the historical distinction between primary and secondary qualities signify? It was not a distinction at the perceptual level at all. At the scientific level, shape and size are facts about the object obtained by measurement and physical geometry. That is, science starts with the perceived object and uses its methods to obtain scientific information. When it came to color, it found that this could be correlated with the frequency of the light reflected from the object to some delicate instrument or to the eye. In this way, color got a new meaning which should never be confused with its perceptual meaning. As one would expect, a good epistemology will help to clear up many past confusions. I prefer mine to Whitehead's much proclaimed pro- nouncement that he had wrestled with, and overcome, this dichotomy by return to a reformed subjectivism, akin to Berkeley's. Thus I agree with Wilfrid Sellars's conclusion: "Science has not shown our common sense judgments to be false; it gives new truths in terms of new concepts which correlate with our commonsense truths and concepts."</page><page sequence="8">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 79 I must limit myself to one final topic, that of categorial meanings and the implications for the future of our acquired knowledge about things. Wilfrid Sellars points out that I crossed swords with C. I. Lewis on this point. He is engaged in working it out logically. I need not say much more than that I agree with his approach. The laws of sense perception relate it to bodily and physical occurrences. "Consequently, a vicious circle lurks in the attempt to analyze common sense physical properties in terms of perceptual subjunctives,-for the analysis of the latter leads right back to physical terms." Here we have the problem of antecedent reality which Dewey so scorned. Yet as my son points out, "if statements about physical objects did not analytically imply statements about conditional future experiences, physical objects (supposing that we could form such concepts) would be dinge an sich otiose and barren." I have myself written in the Philosophy of Physical Realism of the involvements of things and the implications of knowledge. I expect to hear more about the logic of this set-up in the future. For instance, Everett Nelson seems to be outgrowing traditional empiricism, that is, immediacy. Perhaps, logicians need training in epistemology. Clearly, the answer to both Hume and Kant is along this line. The most basic meanings which we work out in the perceptual framework in our interactions with things, and they with one another, are the categorial meanings, like thinghood and causality. These become regulative. We expect things to be more or less stable, to be executive. As we gain knowledge, we work out implications and test and retest them. Hume's sensationalism forced his psychologism and skepticism. Kant wanted more but had no adequate theory of perceiving. Hence aprioricategories were pressed upon the sense-manifold. The machinery was terrific. How often in philosophy has a wrong start led to creations of pure genius which then seemed the only way out! In my attack on Kant in Evolution- ary Naturalism I sketched the empirical theory of categorial meanings. We think the world in these terms because they are natural developments and work. But they usually need clarification and improvement at the scientific level, as we all realize in this age of relativity and quantum mechanics. Professor Chisholm's paper is just the sort of searching analysis that a fellow philosopher finds enlightening. He begins with a study of various gambits with respect to perceiving and ends with the consideration of the topic of existential status of appearances or sensory data. It is my ma- terialistic inclusion of these factors in the brain-events which he finds obscure. He is more favorably inclined to my analysis of perceiving. Now I early defined epistemology as the study of the nature, conditions and reach of human knowing. Like all empiricists, I began with per- ception. Human knowing is really a complicated affair for there is external</page><page sequence="9">80 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH knowing, reflexive self-cognition and what is usually called introspection as a method. That I like something, have developed certain habits and dispositions, is reflexive self cognition. That I perceive the things around me, know how to handle them and have even gained scientific knowledge about them is external knowing. That I can note such data as sensory appearances, images and feelings is an introspective affair. As Chisholm recognizes, I have been largely concerned with the possi- bility of giving empiricism a better starting-point than traditional empiricism gave it. On the whole, that bad inception was, I think, due to two errors: (1) the stress on the causal approach with neglect of the response and completion and (2) the habit of thinking of knowing as a direct awareness, or apprehension, of the object. To correct the first error, I have emphasized referential response of a directed sort, readily symbolized by pointing and by such demonstratives as "this" and "that." The second error can be met by calling attention to the "aboutness" of knowing and how it is supplemented by characterization. These two corrections point in the same direction. Without this sharp shift to "knowledge about," brave efforts at "direct" realism tend to end like G. E. Moore's puzzle as to whether sense-data are parts of the surface of the hand. I avoid this gambit because I distinguish sharply between sensing and perceiving. I see no reason to doubt that sensory factors are guiding perceptual reference and characterization but such data and the object of perception have a quite different status. As I see it, a good deal of naive realism has been naive in that it had no clear idea of the nature of direct, perceptual knowing; in fact, tended to regard it as an apprehension of the object the external thing was somehow; open to inspection. What critical realism seeks to do is to clear up the kind of knowing involved. Had he sufficiently recognized reference and characterization, Moore's care and persistence would have brought a greater reward. The ingenuity exercised in the defense of phenomenalism illustrates the same point. By phenomenalism I understand the attempt to translate physical-thing statements into statements about actual, or possible, sense-data. The epistemological motivation is obvious. It rests on the tradition that only what can be given can be known. I have just been reading Ayer's long disquisition on Phenomenalism.3 For him, the alter- native to it, once one has adopted the sense-datum terminology, is the "iron-curtain theory of perception," that is, that the object is unknowable. But critical realism, as Professor Chisholm sees, represents a denial that the gambit to the effect that the percipient first of all perceives only his own ideas is justified. 3 A. J. Ayer, Philo8ophical Essays, 143.</page><page sequence="10">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 81 It is not that a correct understanding of perceiving is the whole duty of the philosopher but that, if he goes astray here, all his ingenuity will be of no avail. Even the theory of meaning is involved, for a proper ap- preciation of the framework of perceiving indicates how meanings and concepts develop in connection with activities such as looking at, mani- pulating, comparing, measuring. The very referential nature of perceiving requires interpretative efforts culminating in meanings. In other words, perceiving is shot through with meanings tied in with expectations, memories, and discriminations. Categorical meanings, like thinghood and causality, are intrinsic to perceiving; and these are supported by des- criptive meanings. Start merely from sense-data and you cannot attain such meanings. Hume was puzzled by this fact and took refuge in skep- ticism. Logical positivism raised a good question but, because of its bad epistemology, gave a poor answer. Meanings cannot be reduced to an assemblage of sensations. Concepts are not that sort of thing. But to return to Chisholm's analysis. He is very interested in the role af appearances in perception and explores them as one of the conditions of perception. He has many good points to make here. But I was pleased to find that he agrees with me on my central point, namely, that per- ceiving is directed at external objects. In this way I avoid the sense- datum fallacy of which Prichard made so much. "Let us say, more generally, that one commits the sense-datum fallacy if one believes that, merely from statements describing how things appear and statements describing the causal conditions of appearing, one can infer that appearances are perceived or that no physical things are perceived." I was interested in his translations of Price's terminology. The English tend to use perceive where I use intuit or sense. I remember very well how I once suggested to Russell that perceiving is a far more complex operation than sensing and how he rejected the idea impatiently, thus ignoring the referential nature of perceiving. Price has always bothered me for he seemed betwixt and between. I note that Professor Harris still locates him as a sense-datum theorist. Again, Chisholm, quite rightly, rejects the inferential view of perceiving which starts from speculations about the causal conditions of perceiving. Perceiving is not an inference in the ordinary sense of the word 'in- ference.' I was once exploring the possibilities in Hume's suggestion that common sense takes impressions to be things. The difficulty here is that it pre- supposes that people have the notion of persistent things. And, of course, they do. And Hume found it could not be reconciled with his presup- positions. But it seemed, even then, better than the "philosophical notion" that impressions are copies of objects never given. We have seen</page><page sequence="11">82 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH how Russell reacted in the same way. The referential theory of perceiving sought to get out of this impasse by a better understanding of perception, recognizing the directed response vector. I suppose that so many philo- sophers keep a liking for Berkeley's attempt to identify ideas and things for the above reasons. C. I. Lewis is an instance; and, until a referential analysis of perceiving is pressed home, this kind of empiricism has its attractions. Chisholm's verdict that taking sense-impressions for things or regarding them as symbols of things is no solution is correct. What I was once trying to, explore was the psychology of naive realism. There is a thickness about sense-perception in that it packs together sensory data, categorial meanings and reference. The two meanings of the verb "see" for the visual field and for looking at illustrate what I have in mind. What must be made explicit is the difference between inspection, on the one hand, and objective reference and characterization, on the other hand. Once we have made up our mind as to the status of sensory data, Moore's problem vanishes. That Chisholm likes the language of appearances is clear. And it is a good language. The conditions of perceiving can readily be made explicit by means of it. I am glad that he is investigating Gestalt pheno- mena, constancy, and correspondence control. Perceiving is an achievement of a high order. Somewhat like Dewey and Peirce, I never overstressed the problem of the external world. I felt it more than did Dewey, because of his rejection of the problem of perception. That is, he took perceiving as just a. natural event with a future reference. The whole problem of the privacy of consciousness which went with traditional empiricism was, I think, sidetracked for him by his Hegelian inheritance. That was why he went so easily to a kind of experiential behaviorism. I, on the other hand, took the perceptual experience as personal but as involving communicable claims. It was for this reason that the mind-body problem took for me an acuter shape. Thus Chisholm is quite correct in his interpretation. I do regard both reflexive self-cognition and externally directed perception as having prima face credibility, supported by consilience and practical working. I do not look for some incorrigible intuition at the foundation. This is, likewise, my view of memory. I remember what I have perceived and can check up on it. The phenomenalist has more difficulty here than the realist. It is the very job of memory to fill the gaps within perceivings. And so we come, finally, to the problem of the material status of sensory appearances. Can they be categorized as intrinsic to cerebral happenings? I have long waited for a competent critique of this question. I shall begin by discussing "it." Chisholm rightly sees that I reject</page><page sequence="12">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 83 Locke's unknown substratum. For me, "it" is, broadly, a knowable thing. Now thinghood is a categorial meaning which is worked out in the framework of perception and is applied regulatively in perception. It signifies something spatio-temporal which has a measure of stability and executive power and which can be referred to and handled. This is the foreground meaning connected with such things as chairs, apples, etc. The background is the physical environment. Our referential characterization of such "its" signifies that our knowledge about them discloses their characteristics, such as structure and behavior. To me, the mythological aspect of Locke's position is that what is known consists of entities called properties which have to be stuck on a substratum. No; it is the concrete thing that is known about. But what is the reach and grip of this kind of external knowledge? As I have studied the mechanism of perception-and of scientific knowledge which uses it as its point of departure-I have been impressed by the idea that such knowledge concerns that which is reproducible, like pattern and order. At least, this foundation helps us to decipher such traits as composition, nomic involvements, quantities. All this is good knowledge about things and leaves them as concrete as you will. Properties as entities hanging on by their eyebrows does not make sense to me. And I am inclined to believe that this tradition goes with representative realism or the copy theory; a sort of one-to-one correspondence between ideas and primary properties. The moral is, again, that an adequate epistemology is necessary for a good ontology. What, then, can we mean by "inner nature"? The inner nature is, of course, the concrete thing as a going concern. It is all there is to that which so acts and is so structured. It is being, an sich. Physical realism is ontological. And it is, at the scientific level, concerned more with what Locke called the "real essence" of things, that is, their organized compositions and dispositional capacities. Here we have the import of ontological categories. The facts of knowledge-about have this texture. As I see it, then, referential knowledge-about presupposes the concrete actuality of its objects. There is no vacuous actuality for the realist. That bit of mythology goes with the experientialist perspective. Of course, to know about is not to intuit. But facts involve the concrete actuality which they disclose. Here is my sense of the fullness of being. What, then, did "inness' and "on the inside" mean to me? Essentially, contrast with facts about. And this was also the inport of the term, participation. The idea was that the flow of consciousness was intrinsic to the activities of the brain-mind. When this was engaged in referential perceiving it contained, and was guided by, sensory factors. These are ''natural isolates" because they do not possess the capacity to "know"</page><page sequence="13">84 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH their existential context in the brain. Their existential continuity with the brain-event is seamless. It just surprises scientists to find that they have sensations since they start from abstract knowledge about the physical world. The panpsychists just go to the other extreme. They are not physical realists. As I see it, it is an affair of proper categorizing. Here the philosopher should be of some assistance to the scientists. Hie has not been of much help because he has not mastered his epistemological job. I was pleased to note that Professor Chisholm granted that I committed no obvious fallacy and was an improvement on Case. Russell's neutral monism has quite another history, connected with radical empiricism. Those who will consult my bibliography will see that I began this outlook in the first decade of this century and just sharpened its categories. Consciousness is not conserved; it is occurrent. Dispositions summarize. Anyone who has followed my argument will realize how important an adequate epistemology is. Is it to be wondered at that I was irritated by Dewey's diatribe against "epistemologs" ? In my opinion, philosophy had a technical job to do. I welcome Kuiper's fair and detailed study of my solution of the mind- body problem. In the end, he seems to find comfort in Lewis; but how a phenomenalist-if Lewis is one-can throw light on the mind-body problem, as the realist sees it, is to me a trifle puzzling. That color, as a word, has secured two diverse meanings is just a linguistic fact. That light frequencies affect the retina and thence the visual center, thus leading to color experiences, seems to be a well-established union of physical, physiological and psychological facts. But I, myself, would never think of defining a red sensation or a red color of a thing in terms of these facts. But I am well aware that modern logic can do anything correctly that it wishes to do. There are all sorts of "definitions" these days. But this is to anticipate. Let me turn now to Kuiper's exposition. He is quite right in distinguishing my position from behaviorism in its extreme form. That was a methodological affair tied in with exasperation over introspection. I remember its stages very well. Present-day psychology is methodologically very complex and sophisticated. It is even beginning to flirt with epistemology. Kuiper recognizes the importance here of the theory of levels. It is the brain as functioning that we shall be concerned with, though, to function, it must have its marvelous composition and its proper supply of glucose. By the way, I liked Sherrington's suggestion that the emergent evolutionists should say that the whole is other than the parts rather than more than the sum of the parts. The stress should be upon relational pattern; and as he points out, it has taken many millions of years to establish neural patterns.4 4 I refer, of course, to Sherrington's Man on Hi8 Nature.</page><page sequence="14">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 85 Now there is no intuitive knowledge that the brain is the organ of thought and consciousness. It was experimentally discovered. In a note on page 52 of his paper, Kuiper suggests that I must hold the position that, if conscious contents are intrinsic to the brain, I must be aware of the brain. "If one is aware of A and if A is identical with B, then one is also aware of B." But there are distinctions to be made. Suppose A is a red sensation or sensation of red (internal accusative) I can be aware of it as a datum. But it is not, for my position, all there is to a brain-event. It is a qualitative phase of it which is a natural isolate from the rest since it is not a knowing of the rest. It is just what it is. In other words, Kuiper's flat identification of A and B is more akin to the panpsychist's scheme than to mine. Even Russell gets into this difficulty. After Kuiper really gets going he recognizes these distinctions. Of course, if to participate, in consciousness, in cerebral activity is, by definition, to know it, then we know it. But isn't this merely a matter of arbitrary definition. But I do not want to overdo this point. The Gestaltists have conducted experiments to show a certain isomorphism between brain patterns and mental states. But the brain patterns are here known about from the outside. The tests as to whether cerebral processes involve consciousness are those used in medicine. Head found that the vigilance of the cortex decreased with sleep. And I have the impression that Adrian's methods confirm this. When the tonus of the roof-brain falls below a certain level we are asleep, "Not that with the cessation of the roof-brain's tonus all activity in it, chemical and physical, ceases. Far from that. What happens is that certain kinds of chemical and physical activity subside, while others go forward."5 If consciousness were to give knowledge of its context, it would be knowledge about these activities. They are patterned activities. Thus I identify consciousness with activities. These constitute the ontological context of consciousness. That is the sort of materialist I am. I stress spatio-temporal functions of a high level, regarding them as possessing sensory qualia in a way which must be properly categorized. And such categorization depends upon a grasp of the epistemological situation. I could take the offensive here and ask Kuiper what the alternative is. He speaks of Mind as though it were a kind of active substance which he has knowledge about, even acquaintance with. I think we would actually agree that it must cover such factors as abilities, dispositions and oc- current processes. But is not the brain the most likely candidate for the locus of these abilities, dispositions and occurrent qualia? Even common sense has so begun to speak. In its own fashion, the Aristotelian tradition worked along organic lines. It is really Cartesian dualism which has to 5 Ibid., p. 211. Doubleday Anchor edition.</page><page sequence="15">86 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH be overcome. Kant was quite frank about it and gave the mind no lo- cation at all. Sherrington is bothered but gets himself mixed up in epistemology-small wonder-and lets it go at that. Now a philosopher should be able to help straighten things out. Does not the brain have the preference if the various factors can be categorized properly? Of course, we must take evolution seriously; and that means the capacities of the brain. As I see it, the field of one's consciousness is dominantly bi-polar. The subject pole consists of feelings and background activities which are over against external perceiving. But this subject pole can, itself, become the locus of reflexive self-cognition. And then we know the "self" as taking attitudes, valuing, purposing, feeling. As I see it, the self is a referent in which we are consciously participating as we cannot in the objects of external perception. Thus I take the self seriously; but I wonder whether it is not a term for an historical development of functions from babyhood to adulthood. We now come to the dialectical impasse Kuiper builds upon. To be an appearance, to be a datum, means to be an item of immediate awareness to a mind (call it self, subject, or what you will). Here, he argues, is a defining trait of mind for which there is no neural equivalent. In my terms, that is, this trait cannot be known from the outside about another's brain. Now I want to do justice to Kuiper's difficulty. As noted in my analysis of the bi-polar feature of the field of consciousness, I take directed compresence, or awareness, seriously. From early days I speculated upon it as an indication of the reality of functional unity as against traditional atomism. I still think that dispositional capacities involve such functional togetherness. Here the spatio-temporal whole is other than its parts, as such. I speak of integrative causality in this connection. In short, when the neurologist speaks of the activity of the brain as a whole-and I take it to be a self-directed activity-I find correspondence to the compresense of the field of consciousness. But we must first clear up a verbal ambiguity. Kuiper uses the term, consciousness, as a synonym of consciousness of, awareness of. I recognize that usage but prefer to use the latter expressions. This kind of knowing, which stands out in introspection, must be contrasted with the referential kind of knowing which is characteristic of perceiving and reflexive self- cognition. The usual synonyms are intuition and acquaintance with. Now I do not seek to "explain" this "awareness of" by appeal to the brain. I take it to be a fact which should find support in our knowledge of the working of the brain. What I have been largely interested in was to show that the field of consciousness, experiencing, if you will, was not alien to the brain. The query was this, Could I think a sense-datum as</page><page sequence="16">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 87 intrinsic to a brain event? then I would ask whether the whole field of consciousness could not be conceived along similar lines, bringing in integrative activities. My job was not so much "explaining" as properly categorizing. Since Kuiper refers again to his earlier point to the effect that if one is aware of A and A is identical with B, then one must be aware of B, I must repeat that the problem here is the proper categorizing of the identity of A with B. I take a sensation, A, to be an occurrent factor in a brain-event which is a natural isolate which has no capacity to know its neural context. Why should it have? That knowledge-about is the sort of thing the team of experts may well investigate. Vary conditions and what happens? Now the import of all this is that I was challenging the priority of Cartesian dualism. It was in this sense that I was enlarging the category of the physical in both evolutionary and epistemological ways. From another angle, I was equally revising the notion of mind, making it more functional and giving it a location. I granted empirical awareness of, and referential knowing, as facts. But I still thought that light could be thrown upon them by a study of their neural conditions. Are they not intrinsic to complex causal activities? Just to say the magic words, mind, self, subject, did not seem to me enough. It was, therefore, a question of integrating our double knowledge of ourselves. All this was logically tied up with critical realism and evolutionary naturalism. It was in this philosophical setting that I went beyond functional correspondence to ontological togetherness. Kuiper must see that I moved in two directions: (I) from consciousness to its existential setting in the brain as the object of external knowledge, and (2) from the brain, so known about, to consciousness. What I had in mind was the concrete actuality. Why had it been split up in this traditional fashion? Now, for me, knowledge about is always abstract and descriptive and never pretends to be an intuition of the object. But the object itself-in this case the functioning brain-is concrete. And that is why the two types of knowledge do not conflict. I do not say that the pulse of consciousness is all there is to the brain-state but I do say it is a factor intrinsic to it. And it must always be remembered that the term, mind, includes cons- ciousness and a background of activities and dispositions which play into consciousness. I can note the relevance of Lewis's technique to the situation as Kuiper envisages it. But, surely, he can see that I am not trying to translate by definition "the utterly familiar specifications of the mental (conscious- ness)" into the "unknown (unintuited) brain-states about which we have, in non-introspective science, only knowledge about". What I am doing is to recognize the situation we are in. Lewis, on the other hand, is thinking</page><page sequence="17">88 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH within the setting of radical empiricism and phenomenalism. If he once became an overt physical realist, he would, I feel certain, have to take much my path. I am going to use Bahm's paper as a point of departure for some summa- rizing remarks on modern materialism with special regard to what I call levels of causality. This will be in preparation for the treatment of values and religion in the last two papers. Ontological materialism is a covering term for the rejection of idealism and phenomenalism and Cartesian dualism. These will not do. But crude ideas of the material world will not do either. The days of reductive mechanicalism have gone forever. We must take account of nature in its actual heterogeneity and, not least of all, we must do justice to man's world and to human capacities. Life with its plasticity, knowing, feeling valuing, creative construction must all enter the picture. Naturalism has been a good mediating term but it did not always get down to funda- mentals. On the whole, I thought it was well to grasp the nettle firmly. It is ontological materialism with the recognition of qualitative novelty going with patterns, integrated wholes, the functioning of dispositional properties. It other words, it is not an atomistic materialism but one which does justice to the emergence of functional unities with, as we say, a life of their own. It is this kind of novelty and autonomy which demands recognition. Here is reformed, non-reductive materialism, able to do justice to valuation, choice and reason. Its competitors are the formal materialism of the Thomists and the dialectical materialism of the Marxists Its foundation is physical realism. Now, in my epistemology, I have tried to show where traditional em- piricism went wrong through ignoring directed response. The result was a realistic empiricism whose framework gave room for the rise of categorial meanings such as thinghood and causality. In a similar manner I have tried to replace Cartesian dualism by a naturalization of mind and consciousness, showing that these are not alien to the living and functioning brain. The advance in epistemology helped here; as did the theory of organizational emergence. It all seemed to me quite logical. It is equally clear that an able thinker like Russell came as near to it as he could with his Humian presuppositions. But now I am about to consider valuation as well as cognition. It was one of my early theses that valuing is a different job from cognizing, though cognition is used in the operation. In ethics we are concerned with the proper understanding of a new set of categorial meanings, such as good, right, obligation, duty. These are not a prior in a Kantian sense any more than thinghood and causality are. But they function guidingly and even prescriptively. When we decide that something is really good, our attitude to it and our conduct towards it become definitely pro.</page><page sequence="18">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 89 However, this is to anticipate. I want at present to consider the evolu- tionary significance of integrative, or organizational, causality. I do not think that Bahm quite realized how basic this conception was for my thought. I also hope that Donald Williams who, likewise, calls himself a materialist, will note where my argument differs from his. As I get it, his epistemology savors more of the new realism than of referential, critical realism. I do not think that this gives him the same leverage for organization. The idea of evolution led me to stress immanent causality as coordinate with transeunt causality. Integration signifies some degree of functional unity. In this sense, the whole is other than its parts. Immanent causality could involve dispositional packing, ordered timing, etc. What all this signified was that the category of efficient causality lent itself to enlargement. This was what I called levels of causality. As I saw it, an element of self-direction entered with dispositions. One factor must adjust itself to others in a unified domain. There may even be dominance and timing, one step leading to another. All this seemed to be exemplified in the biological realm. Traditional mechanism and vitalism were to be replaced by an enlarged notion of immanent causality along these lines. Self-guidance, or directedness, was to replace traditional teleology. As I see it, modern biology is wrestling now with just such ideas. There are all sorts of physico-chemical devices organizationally related. I suppose that I differ from such idealists as Whitehead in that I do not think that philosophical introspection can anticipate the relational complexity involved. It must be worked out empirically. But I agree that categories need revision. I have always thought of categorial meanings as responsive to the framework of thought and did not hold that the per- ceptual situation, which was their starting-point, had final say. I took all recognizable levels of evolution seriously, physical, chemical, biological, human, social. Societies are continuing organizations of acculturated individuals who come and go. On this point I do not think that Bahm was quite fair to me. Morality, for instance, I regard as in- volving a social context. Meta-ethics has the task of understanding its categorial meanings. Surely, we are concerned, here, more with valuation and responsible choice than with pure cognition; and the categories should be different. If immanent, efficient causality is the matrix for the development of guidance or directedness, then we can understand the import of the demand for freedom at the level of self-consciousness. By its very nature immanent causality-here self-determination-resents external constraint. We want to do what we want to do. And there is always some measure of rehearsal. This expresses itself modally in the conviction that we could</page><page sequence="19">90 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH and we would. Looking back, we restate this relationship as a would have if. The self is causal just because it is a complex of tendencies which is viable only to the degree that it is unified. In short, the theory of self- determination as a process of decision, instead of evading the issue of free- will, puts us into the heart of the immanent causality of the self as a going concern. And I cannot see that existentialism at its best does anything else. Choice is real and choice is earnest; and it is inescapable. Indetermi- nism is, surely, of the nature of a protest against theistic, or mechanical foreordination. But that there are subtleties about moral decision I would not deny. Perhaps I can say something about them in the next section. Remorse and contrition concern the peculiar causality of adopted standards which we violate. To sum up: ontological materialism follows if one undercuts the assumptions of Descartes, Berkeley and Kant. These were delaying actions which have served their purpose. In this evolutionary age, science has passed into a new climate. Passive matter, dead-level mechanicalism, the alienness of life, consciousness and mind, are getting to be things of the past. But now materialism means little else than the rejection of subjectivism and anthropomorphism. All the fascinating problems of philosophy remain for clarification: the actual heterogeneity of things, the enlargement of efficient causality to include the level of self-direction and motivation, the nature and conditions of referential perception, valuation and its justifiability, moral choice and its categories. There is to-day so much analytic ability-if it were only freed from its presup- positions! It is a pity to see it turn round and round on its own axis. And so we come to Frankena's paper on valuation. It is a carefully presented analysis of my various remarks on the subject and recognizes the pivotal nature of the contrast between cognition and valuation. Though interwoven, the two tasks differ in their nature and conditions. I believed in value-judgments and their statement in value-assignments. It was not a mere matter of the evincing of feelings and emotions. That, I take it, was a tour-de-force which accompanied the positivistic reduction of meanings to the method of getting sensations. No; I studied valuations with realistic empiricism as a background. It seemed to me that we were making claims in valuation but they were not the same kind of claims as in cognition. I recognized that people spoke of value-judgments as being true or false, especially moral ones; but-to use the phrasing of to-day-I recommended a change in usage. I thought that it would be less misleading if we defined true in connection with cognitive claims as meaning "acceptable as a case of knowledge." That is, the claim is granted. A valuation, on the other hand, that is, a value assignment could be regarded as justifiable, well-based, adequate. What I had in mind was the point that cognition is essentially descriptive and factual</page><page sequence="20">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 91 It is largely concerned with what I called knowledge-about, and tended toward neutrality and impersonality. Valuation, on the other hand, is, quite clearly, an affair of reflexive bearing, of a double base, of what the object means to us. Our feelings, purposes, attitudes are relevant to the value assignment made. But it still seemed to me that we were ap- praising objects in this relational way and that we had developed corre- sponding categorial meanings, esthetic, utilitarian, moral. In each of these fields we develop standards and criteria. The relation of valuations to standards is an interesting one. These tend to be socially established and to be prescriptive. But the reflective individual can always challenge them. His Umwertung should be relevant and rational, defensible. It should surprise no one that I was led to reject G. E. Moore's objective, intrinsic theory of value. And this for three good reasons: (I) valuation did not seem to me to be an affair of intuition, (2) it is reflexive and relational, and (3) it has a motivational tonus. The revolt against intuitionism is pretty strong to-day even in England, its home.6 The essential point I made is that value is not an objective property, natural or non-natural. What we really assert in a valuation is that the object is valuable to me, the group, humanity. We make a justifiable, relational appraisal. It is common to point out to-day that if value were merely an intuited property-non-natural if you will-there would still be the question of its appeal. Now all this seemed fairly obvious to me. The framework of critical realism suggested it. Surely, we do appraise objects and take attitudes towards them accordingly. Our feelings get reference. Our attitudes are pro or con. And these attitudes find expression in language in talk about objects. But such terms are not descriptive but valuative. Thus, in saying that a picture is beautfiful, we are not primarily describing it but esthetically appraising it. What we do, if queried, is to support our esthetic judgment by calling, attention to features of the picture which have esthetic import. It is not merely a matter of evidence, as in cognition. It follows from all this that I agreed with Moore that moral terms are not descriptive but valuative. To say that an act is right is not primarily to point to its satisfactory consequences but to approve of it morally as commendable, perhaps because it fits in with some moral rule. In oughtness we feel a demand upon ourselves and our accepted moral principles. I like the category of demand in preference to command. I think the imperative mood has been overdone recently. But all this is perfectly natural and in accord with the best traditions of philosophical naturalism. Surely, a man is an appraising agent with 6 In his recent Ethics, Nowell-Smith argues against both Moore and Broad along these lines.</page><page sequence="21">92 PHILOSOPHY AND PHIENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH purposes and the job of evaluating objects and possibilities. It seemed to me very unfortunate that Moore's intuitionalistic approach to intrinsic value set so many young thinkers off on this wild-goose chase of anti- naturalism in ethical theory. The essential thing was the clarification of the nature of valuation. To value is not to describe or to intuit a non- natural property but to appraise on relational grounds; in this sense, to give reasons for the appraisal, to say why something desired is desirable. What I objected to in the logical positivists and in Stevenson was the reductive approach. Moral judgment is not an affair of suggestion and persuasion and the use of emotive terms, but of justifiable principles related to attitudes and concern with what is considered good for ourselves and others. A consequential approach to morals must always feed back into moral attitudes; and these have their roots in such factors as socially recognized rights and duties, (justice) and the adjustment of self-regarding and other-regarding motivations, all this finding expression in rules and standards. It is not surprising that, as a technical philosopher, I was also critical of C. D. Broad's attempt to bring a prior synthetic propositions into the moral field. I quite saw why he was led in this direction. It ran parallel to his appeal to causality and substance as a prior concepts applied to sensations in perception. Now, I had argued that categorial meanings develop within the framework of referential perceiving with its coordination of percipient and referent and its activities. As we saw, this view enabled us to give a base for concepts and to undercut the sensationalistic form of the verificational theory of meaning. But much the same argument holds for the rise of value-meanings and assignments, including moral concepts. All are empirical in origin and regulative application. Here they are native to the framework of persons, demands, concerns, consequences and established attitudes. To recognize this framework is to expect the divergence between the ought and the is, between demand and description. Only a science or a philosophy which does not fully acknowledge the existence of valuing agents can still goggle at the contrast. To me it is but the culmination of self-directive efficient causality. How could man act without normative guidance ? So much in the way of perspective in the value field. I must now turn to Frankena's queries. In section 2, he points out that I recognize that we can have knowledge about our feelings, purposes and desires. Quite so. We can even have knowledge about our past valuations. But to judge valuatively involves an appraisal which may be questioned and needs justification. As I see it, this can come only in the way of support which plays into sensitized feeling and cumulative attitude. A valuation must wear well. It must be something</page><page sequence="22">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 93 you can live with. It is not an affair of mere feeling but of tested feeling about. The context must be relational, exploratory, discriminative. That is how criteria become relevant. It is good because... Don't you feel it so ? What people call truth, here, is really adequacy, justifiableness, a sustainable attitude towards. It- does not have the kind of objectivity characteristic of description. But it has objective import. All forms of radical empiricism like to translate statements about things into predictions about the future. "This object is round" becomes "I shall have a succession of round-like sensations." But, surely, these are not equivalent, even though the second follows from the first causally with the addition of myself as a percipient. And when I say that a friend is likeable, I do not merely mean that I shall have enjoyable experiences in association with him. I expect these but I connect them with traits in the friend which affect me agreeably. A pro-attitude has an objective base. But a value-assignment is not a description. It has its own vocabulary. I suppose that it was because I was interested in agency as well as in knowing, that I was led to contrast cognition and valuation. Even knowledge has to be valued. Affective response is the very basis of living. But it. is seldom blind. It has its own logic, the experimental working out of criteria and standards. To call value a tertiary quality seems to me, again, to continue the confusion between the context of cognition and that of valuation. To speak of it as a non-natural property does the same. To call it an inherent property does not seem, to me, much of an advance. Surely, to value is to appraise relationally, to connect up the object with a response in a significant way. Henceforth, we tend to think of the object after this fashion though not descriptively. Paul is generous; the act is right; that law is just. If you say that I am right, that it is true that these assertions hold, you are merely endorsing my claims but not maintaining that they correspond to facts in a cognitive manner. That is why I spoke of value- assignments as different from descriptions. Once one has adopted this outlook, transcendentalistic theories of values go by the board. Plato's Form of the Good is an entity to be intuited after due preparation. In his revolt against the carelessness of hedonism, G. E. Moore took refuge in intuitionism. What was needed was a more careful examination of the significance of valuation, non-moral and moral. There are many signs that this is under way. What helped me at the time was, I think, the definiteness of my epistemology. Responses, attitudes, appraisals seemed clearly to be something else again; a practical, agential linking up with the object under the impulsion of needs and purposes, a thoughtful valuation able to give "becauses." In sec. 4, Frankena asks why feelings cannot be the base for predicates of a cognitive sort about objects.</page><page sequence="23">94 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Now I think there is a natural division of labor here, with a biological foundation. My feelings tell me how I feel and, referentially, how I feel about objects and events. But description of the objects depends upon the use of sensory data. It is not the "relativity" of satisfactions, as he suggests, but their irrelevance to the cognitive enterprise that leads us to set them aside. On the other hand, they are relevant to actions and the growth of motivations and attitudes, pro and con. The context of these is very varied and harbors conceptual distinctions, which find expression in words and phrases. The increasing realization that concepts are not entities to be pointed at and named, but functions of discrimination, in making a good deal of difference in this field. At the moral level, we have distinctive categories, such as duty, right, the virtues, the morally good. These presuppose natural goods, things desired and commended. And the context of morals may be said to be conduct in the light of standards and social demands. Right seems to me to signify that type of conduct which is to, be favored and adhered to because it is in accordance with a moral rule and because this rule is believed to be for the good of the society. Thus it is relational and has a spread which includes attitude and belief. Such rational favoring of rules takes the form of my identification with them. To violate them is to violate my own moral integrity. Hence the sense of ought and ought not. These express demands upon myself related to my moral adoptions. Taken in this context, the categorical imperative simply expresses the demand on me of my own moral identifications. Such deontology is not an affair of intuition but of established attitude. It should always be under the control of consequences. I do not think that Frankena would disagree with me on essentials. What has happened, since the years in which I sketched these distinctions, is the swing, first, from intuitionism to a positivism which had no adequate feeling for categories and then, gradually, to a more realistic outlook. The difference between the logic of description, induction and deduction, and that of valuation and its rational support was only slowly explored and formulated. But I find myself in large agreement with the emphases of Hampshire, Toulmin, Nowell-Smith and others. Yet, as an American, I would protest that the perspective thus arising is very similar to that sketched by Everett, A. K. Rogers, J. B. Pratt and myself a considerable time ago. The clue was there in the realization of the difference in intention between knowing and valuing. If his admirers consider me too critical of G. E. Moore, it must be remembered that I was essentially a con- temporary and that I diverged in both epistemology and axiology. I could never see that valuation was not as natural an operation in its own genre as descriptive cognition. Value was not a non-natural property, for it was simply not a property at all; and yet objects are valuable to us.</page><page sequence="24">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 95 Ten Hoor's study of naturalistic religion is done with so much under- standing that I have little to reply to. My point of departure within religion was, of course, that of modernism or liberalism. Here was already an evolution, in a cultural sense, away from dogmatic features of super- naturalism; and with it had gone personal and social reorientation. The belief in immortality had become less positive; prayer was less petition and more meditation; eschatology was not taken seriously. Interest in psychology and the social sciences had increased. The social climate in the United States was one of gradualism and tempered optimism. But there was awareness of problems. Reform movements were in the air. The next step in religion, as I saw it, was to carry modernism a step further, to make it face up to the possibility that the whole supernatu- ralistic framework might well have to be relinguished. What then? Not something negative but something positive. A frank facing up to the human situation, a reinterpretation of the import of human living with its clash between goods and evils. The idea was that the experienced meaning of human life was intrinsic to its texture, as this was displayed in human relations of all sorts, from those of everyday life to those of artistic and scientific endeavor. Meaning must not be tied to some, sup- posed, cosmic plan, but to meaningful activities which were found fruitful in satisfactions. A little healthy semantics is needed here. Philosophy should be an agency to help in such a transition, sup- plementing the sciences. I draw no sharp line between a philosophy of life and a religious outlook with its working attitudes and communal activities. But, as a technical philosopher, I suppose, I thought of philo- sophy as feeding into the adjustments and the ongoing life of the community rather than as a set of doctrines to replace those of Christian Dogma. -On the whole, I thought of these as gradually evaporating and losing their influence, as in some measure happened in the Eighteenth Century. But with this broad, positive base in philosophy and science I did not think of myself as-a "rationalist," agnostic or free-thinker. These seemed to me dated epithets for it was supernaturalism which was on the defensive. And, in addition, I had some definite analyses to help clear up traditional puzzles which had retarded philosophy's confluence with the scientific outlook, analyses such as those discussed in preceding sections. All this, as I saw it, favored a positive position of a constructive sort. That was why I adopted the term, humanism, as the evocative symbol. Many others have likewise felt it to be- the right word. Some like to speak of scientific humanism; others prefer to call it naturalistic humanism. To me, that is a matter of emphasis. So much in the way of historical perspective. But what happened? Mankind entered a period of war, revolution and social turmoil. Ideology clashed with ideology. Like every other element of human life, religious</page><page sequence="25">96 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH thought and feeling were affected. On the one hand, Marxian and Freudian attacks on supernaturalistically motivated and oriented religion were pushed home with vigor. On the other, Protestant theology underwent a process of activation along neo-Calvinistic lines, thanks, largely, to German thought. An able restatement of medieval Thomism continued to exert pressure. And, to cap all, what was called existentialism contribut- ed its quota of terminology and mystique. As Ten Hoor points out, it is a matter of basic framework. A realistic empiricism just does not invite the introduction of theological categories into its empirically established ones. St. Thomas seeks to show some incompleteness in the latter which points beyond them. This is prepared for by his definitions. But the conception of efficient causality along evolutionary lines, which I have indicated undercuts this formal dialectic. There seems to be no leverage for a prime mover. And so we come to the set-up of crisis theology and Protestant existen- tialism. One can but admire the conceptual energy of Tillich, for example. He aims at a reorientation of Christian thought along more dynamic lines. The "eternal" breaks into the "temporal," There is the kairos- doctrine of crisis. There is an ecstatic reason akin to prophetic revelation; there is faith as "a being grasped by the ground and abyss of being and meaning"; there is the unconditional and the finite. Surely, these are largely emotive words. But, when all is said and done, we have here a theology in recognized league with Bergson, Schelling and Bohme. God is not so much proved to exist as assumed. He is guaranteed by an ecstatic reason set up to do the job. Thus He is beyond fact. Even to assert his existence in this sense is blasphemous. He is being a se, the unconditioned, the infinite, the ground. But, to the evolutionary materialist, the ground floor of being is just the cosmic level of matter and energy which precedes biological evolution and makes it possible under favorable conditons. The model, potentiality, is just the causal would if of integration. The vertical dimension emerges. Here I have stressed an efficient causality which permits self-guidance. So far as I can see, this modification removes the blindness of mechanistic materialism against which William James rightly protested. One final remark and I must conclude this outline of my position. It should be recognized that the contrast between essence and existence of which existentialism makes so much is an inheritance from idealism. The realistic empiricist never departs from existence when it comes to causal activity and that freedom of decision essential to unconstrained choice. I do, then, what I basically want to do at the time. But I am quite aware that I may regret it later when returns are in and sober, second thoughts have their say. Criteria and reason play back into action in varying degree. But I cannot here condense the qualifications which existentialism</page><page sequence="26">MY PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION: A REJOINDER 97 needs. In its own context it has done some good. But its framework is very vague. What seems to me desirable is a stress upon human agency, personal and social, of an informed sort. Let our committments be as rational as possible. Here is the question of praxis; and this requires the clarification and guidance of practical discourse. Concepts and motivation must develop together. It is, surely, not bare freedom which is to be emphasized but freedom guided by justifiable valuations. But I confess I rather enjoy the rhetoric of the existentialists so long as it is not used to befog issues. I shall not even try to summarize. The level of philosophical competence to-day is very high. What it seems to lack is the forthright realism I have defended. There is no "iron curtain" between the percipient and the object perceived. What is needed is, first, the shift from the presup- positions of traditional empiricism with its implicit subjectivism to a realistic empiricism of objective reference and characterization; second, the adoption of a theory of meaning built around this operational axis; third, the clarification of categorial meanings, such as causality and substantiality, in this matrix, to remove the Humian skepticism which went quite logically with traditional empiricism; fourth, the working out of the evolutionary notion of levels of causality, levels culminating in self-guided, human agency; fifth, the recognition that valuation is different from pure cognition and has its own categories; sixth, the connection of moral categories with human agency and its motivations. All this, I have argued, will find issue in a non-reductive materialism. As I see it, then, phenomenalism, logical positivism, Kantianism and idealism were, in the last analysis, developments stemming from a cultural situation we have outgrown. We are at last in a position to fit man into nature while doing justice to what is so distinctive about him, namely, his ability to know about his world and himself and to act in the light of valuations. I expect that traditional puzzles will clear up, once this framework is accepted. Dewey came near to making the shift, but he did not bite in deeply enough. Rusell was on the verge of it, but his retention of the presup- positions of Hume frustrated any frank physical realism. The logical positivists were too satisfied with slogans and techniques but acted as catalyzers. My advantage, as I see it, was that I was not tied in with a tradition. I still think the framework I explored deserves reconsideration. ROY WOOD SELLARS. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.</page></plain_text>
