In a time of spiralling costs and cutbacks by publishers, the advent of a new series dedicated to the rapid publi- cation of high quality, affordable monographs and collec- tions is welcome news to the archaeological community. Prehistory Press has the goal of providing timely publi- cation of a range of scholarly work, both in the Old World and the New World. In this respect, the Press will fill the gap left by the demise of British Archaeological Reports. The volume reviewed here is the first issued by this new press and despite some problems with editing and un- evenness of quality among the papers, it is a good initial effort; even those articles in need of stylistic embellishment offer solid analyses. As the subtitle indicates, the volume is a compilation of papers from the Second Maya Lithic Conference, held in San Antonio, Texas from October 19 to 22, 1982; Wil- liam Fowler and Marc Thompson contributed additional papers. The 21 papers by 20 scholars discuss material from various sites in Belize (nine papers), southern Mexico (five papers), and Guatemala (three papers), but there is a dis- tinct focus on a few key sites (five papers on Colha, three on Cerros, two on Tikal). The papers by Fowler, Eaton, Awe, and McAnany deal with general issues or compare data from several sites. Topically, the authors deal with descriptive taxonomies to facilitate chronological and functional assignments and examination of prehistoric production, craft specialization, microwear analysis, and exchange systems. The authors primarily discuss flaked stone, but several do mention ground stone implements. As an aside, some of the terms the authors employ may confuse readers not accustomed to American usage. For example, in this context a biface is simply a piece worked on both dorsal and ventral surfaces, and does not refer to a specific form, unlike the European use of the term to connote a hand axe. In addition, many of the contributors refer to macroblades, which, although not formally de- fined, seem to be those blades longer than 10 cm. Fowler's introductory paper, on lithic analysis as a means of processual inference, is an excellent review of recent studies in southern Mesoamerica. He identifies ma- jor themes in Mesoamerican lithic studies, which the con- tributions highlight, then presents areas for future re- search. Key among the latter are 1) the need to develop a lithic chronology independent of ceramics, 2) reduction models specific to each local or regional industry, 3) stress on tool function and consumption as elements of eco- nomic organization, and 4) increased focus on replicative experiments, and ethnographic and ethnohistoric analo- gies. The papers which follow, divided into five sections, illustrate the themes Fowler identifies. Fowler and the editors articulate the contribution that lithic studies have made over the past 20 years in resolving major problems of site chronology, function, and interaction. Only a few of the authors, however, follow through fully on Fowler's call for explicitly processual studies, a fact which lessens the value of the volume. Nonetheless, the various papers indicate the significant increase in interest and sophisti- cation of lithic studies in Mesoamerica since the early 1970s, and some of the contributors discuss issues of general interest to scholars who work in other parts of the world. The first three sections are chronological treatments of Maya Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic lithic deposits at various sites. Most of these papers present the results of typological studies. The basic typology includes a series of formal tools which comprise a distinct complex iden- tified initially by Hester and Shafer. In their paper on Classic period material from El Pozito, Belize, Hester, Shafer, and Berry provide a comprehensive list of the Maya chert tool types. Biface forms include oval bifaces, ground- bit celts, tranchet-bit bifaces, stemmed bifaces, lanceolate bifaces, and several other types. The three uniface types are discoid, triangular, and retouched flakes. Plain and stemmed blades and macroblades were important elements in the tool inventories. Arrowpoints were made on flakes</page><page sequence="2">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 19, 1992 525 or blades. Eccentrics (zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and circular types) formed a distinct category. Mitchum and others note the presence of drills and perforators, made on small flakes or burin spalls. The Maya knappers em- ployed four to five different reduction strategies to pro- duce these tools and associated debitage in the Preclassic and Classic periods. Many of the authors note the evidence for extensive reuse or recycling of stone tools in various periods. In another paper, Hester and Shafer use the abun- dant material from the Colha workshops to outline a clear break between the Classic and Early Postclassic. The latter deposits exhibit 1) common use of soft hammer percus- sion in contrast to the almost exclusive use of hard hammer techniques in the early phases, 2) considerable use of im- ported chalcedony, 3) a focus on projectile point produc- tion, and 4) mixture of household midden deposits with workshop debitage, unlike the unmixed "industrial" Clas- sic deposits. The papers by Potter, Shafer, Mitchum, Roemer, Thompson, Sheets, Moholy-Nagy, and Hester, Shafer, and Berry, contain repetitive descriptive typologies. While these taxonomies are all important within the context of the individual reports, some of the authors do not go much beyond the classification and leave the impression that they will elaborate on the key correlations elsewhere, but never do in this volume. Several of the papers in Section 4, "Site Summaries and Special Studies," also lack adequate discussion. There are however, several outstand- ing articles in Sections 1-3. Fedick provides an excellent paper on chert tool production and consumption among Classic Period Maya households based on the analysis of debitage from 12 residential trash deposits between Tikal and Yaxha in the Peten lowlands. To examine the level of integration between centers and rural zones, he lays out and tests three hypotheses which "relate variability in household production and consumption to variables of spatial distance, social distance, and the effects of supply and demand" [p. 103]. He presents several models that attempt to define the role of economics in integrating Classic period centers and their hinterlands, and succinctly lays out the hypotheses and the expectations derived from each of these models. In a finely reasoned discussion, he explains the need to study the entire debitage assemblage, not just the individual final products. He concludes that large centers did not control lithic production in the Peten. In a situation of dispersed residence and production, Clas- sic Tikal and Yaxha served as integrative nodes between centers and their surrounding rural zones. Fedick does the best job of developing the processual inferences Fowler urges in the introduction. Aldenderfer also examines center/non-center relations and demonstrates effectively the complexity of flaked stone tool production and consumption in the Late Classic Pe- ten lakes region. Since this area lacks a production center on a par with Colha, even centers have at best "attached specialists," while lithic production in small sites occurs in various contexts, from "cottage industries," with part-time specialists, to completely ad hoc, unspecialized manufac- ture. Aldenderfer's methods of analysis and sophisticated hierarchy of lithic production within different site contexts deserve careful attention by any scholar interested in the political economies of early states. While many of the authors raise the issue of craft spe- cialization, several deal with the matter directly. Despite a choppy writing style, Roemer provides solid data for com- parative purposes. From his work at a Colha workshop, he suggests the knappers worked skillfully and rapidly; the assemblage exhibits minimal platform preparation for blades and bifaces, and there is evidence for rapid pro- duction of these forms. The prodigious quantities of de- bris at Colha also suggest large-scale professional opera- tions. Roemer estimates that there are 4.95 million pieces of debitage (none larger than 3 x 3 mm) in a 1 cu m section of the deposit. After a good, concise discussion of traits associated with craft specialization, he opines that we must consider such activity as one end of a continuum. I disagree with Roemer in his pessimistic assessment of our ability to distinguish between full-time and part-time specialization; the difference should be discernible in the quantity and quality of lithic production. In the best dis- cussion on this topic, Clark and Bryant ask whether spe- cialists produced the projectile points at Yerba Buena, a Late Classic site in Chiapas. Clark has become noted for his conservative approach to the issue of specialization by knappers, and he again presents a cogent argument, based on certain critical premises (e.g., the need to calculate total output in order to evaluate properly whether the produc- tion of a specific form exceeded the needs of the artisan and his family) that, despite a substantial amount of de- bris, the small number of points, and the numerous errors in manufacture preclude characterization of the Yerba Buena material as evidence of full-time specialization. In discussing the production of celts at Becan, Thompson deals tangentially with specialization. The small mounds of debitage around the site exhibit task differences be- tween those who collected and others who worked the chert nodules-at best a minimal type of specialization. In the final paper in Section 3, Sheets examines the chipped stone tools retrieved during early dredging op- erations at the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza. This study supplements the others because of the clear ritual context of the Cenote. Several other contributors suggest</page><page sequence="3">526 Book Reviews certain forms, such as stemmed macroblades and eccen- trics, had nonsecular functions (an inference based on burial and cache proveniences of the artifacts), but Sheets argues that not only were other tools (various bifaces, obsidian blades, thinning flakes) thrown in, but also the process of lithic production itself may have been imbued with religious significance [p. 184]. Based on his analysis of the lithics, Sheets sees two periods and styles of Cenote use: 1) a Late Classic use by the Maya, and 2) an enhanced Late Classic to Early Postclassic use by a Mexican-oriented group. He also states that the Cenote lithics suggest eco- nomic prosperity in the Terminal Classic-Early Postclassic as the result of resumed trade with Mexican centers. Section 4 presents a range of specialized studies. Mo- holy-Nagy's analysis of the Tikal flaked stone is note- worthy because of the relatively small size of the assem- blage (73,000 pieces retrieved in 14 excavation seasons) despite the urban nature of the site, and because of its being the only detailed discussion in the volume of the problems associated with typological classification. In their report on chert debitage from the Harvard Copan exca- vations, Valdez and Potter demonstrate the value of study- ing sites with small lithic collections-such sites show the variation in prehistoric economic systems. Their conclu- sions for this major center are similar to Fedick's for the Tikal-Yaxha corridor, i.e., that flintknapping was a cottage industry with no centralized control, largely because of the poor quality of the local cherts. The implication is that flakable stone, unlike metals or ceramics, becomes the subject of craft specialization only under optimum con- ditions of high resource quality and maximum availability, and even under the best of circumstances the mere pres- ence of good chert or obsidian may not have supported a specialized traffic in the commodity. The value placed on flaked lithics was often insufficient to generate and support large-scale specialized trade. Torrence (1986) makes very much the same argument for the Aegean obsidian trade. In the first of two papers on microwear analysis, Lew- enstein tests the accuracy of determinations of tool fianc- tions derived from edge angle measurements. In a rigorous program of experimentation she made and used 67 tools for a wide range of tasks, then measured the edge angles and recorded use-wear traces. Her results suggest that for the experimental sample and the archaeological tools from Cerros, edge angles exhibit considerable overlap among various categories and so are not reliable indicators of function. The study clearly demonstrates the value of Maya flaked stone analysis to lithic studies in general. The only problem in the presentation is the use of stem-and- leaf plots to list all edge angles; I found these hard to follow. The second paper deals with woodworking tools at Cerros, in an attempt to discern specialization in "wood artisanship." In a thoroughly documented and well-pre- sented report, with a very useful table summarizing types of microwear from different wood-working actions, Lew- enstein notes that most tools (67%) at Cerros with such traces are casual implements; it is imperative that analysts include such unretouched or minimally retouched lithics in their study samples. Clark presents a highly instructive, ethnoarchaeological study of modern Lacandon Maya knappers who manufac- ture projectile points and blades. Several questions guided his examination of four workshops (two in use, two aban- doned) and two knappers. He set out to determine if one can identify the locus of manufacture in situations where knappers systematically dispose of debris, and to charac- terize the nature of workshop debris and how it appears once it is taken from the workshop. He found that dis- crepancies in individual care and knapping skill were in- deed reflected in the workshops. He concludes tht archae- ologists can identify workshops by the contents because, even with careful cleaning, thousands of micro-flakes re- main on earthen workshop floors. Clark's painstaking work in counting hundreds of thousands of flakes amply illustrates his contention that proper recognition of the manufacturing loci requires study of many floor samples for microdebitage. In addition, he found that production of blades and points occurred in separate locations, the desired end products were missing from workshops, and a low blade to core ratio exists in the debris, all as one might expect. The other two papers in this section suffer from gram- matical and syntactical flaws, but do offer valuable data. Eaton argues that most tools (celts, chisels, blades, smoothers) used by ancient Maya artisans to construct pole and thatch buildings and masonry structures were common implements with multiple functions. He makes the key point that we must expand our definition of lithics to include a structure's individual stones, each of which is an artifact. Gibson identifies what he calls "constricted adzes" on the basis of morphology, style, and microwear analysis (admirably, at both low and high power). The paper could have been strengthened by reference to Lew- enstein's edge angle studies. This is one indication that the volume is not as well integrated as it should be. The final section contains two overview papers. Awe's brief contribution encourages continued development of "holistic" Maya lithic studies. He notes the evolution of such studies from basic descriptive classifications to com- plex analytical systems based on geological methods and economic theories. The former refers to obsidian sourcing studies, which facilitate discussion of trade networks. A</page><page sequence="4">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 19, 1992 527 problem is that most of the lithics discussed in this volume are chert or chalcedony. While many of the authors attri- bute the chert to various sources (especially the "chert- bearing zone" of northern Belize), the assignments are made on the basis of macroscopic attributes, especially color and texture. Chert, however, is notoriously difficult to source on the basis of such visible attributes, or even by trace element analysis. The authors cannot be faulted for the attempt to connect artifacts to particular quarries, but there should be an explicit statement that this is at best a haphazard and tenuous approach. Geochemical studies are currently under way in an effort to develop a reliable chert sourcing technique based on normative min- eral composition (Foradas and Yerkes, personal commu- nication, 1991). As for the economic theories, only a few of the papers discuss such models adequately. McAnany's excellent concluding paper does take up the issue of economic models. She attacks Sanders' notion of symbiotic diversity as the stimulus to craft production and trade within and between the highland and lowland re- gions of central America. In a well-crafted critique, she notes that each zone exhibits rather more ecological com- plexity and heterogeneity in resource distribution and ex- ploitation than the Sanders model allows. From the ex- amination of ethnographic and ethnohistoric cases, she argues that full-time specialization can arise only under the conditions of a money-based economy, or acute land shortages which limit options. She then suggests that trade networks artificially create resource imbalances, which lead to expanding the range of the systems. I believe she fails to give sufficient credit to ecological constraints that stim- ulate exchange. Stone tools fit into her scheme when she explores the articulation between political and economic networks. Since tribute alone is an inadequate means to supply a group with a ubiquitous commodity (e.g., chert tools), low level, non-centralized barter exchange still oc- curs in hierarchically-structured societies. This is precisely the point that many of the preceding studies make. As with the substance of the papers, there are many things to applaud and decry in the technical aspects of the volume. On the positive side, the production quality is very high. The large format and fine font make text and tables highly legible and attractive. The high quality bond paper and flexible spine will stand up to continuous use. The publisher reproduced both photographs and line drawings sharply; this is no mean feat, especially the ex- ceptionally clear photographs of flaked stone tools. The flaws are matters of omission and commission. The lack of a list of figures, a list of tables, and an index was perhaps a matter of choice by the editors, but the inclusion of these features would have enhanced the value of the vol- ume as a reference tool, a function I think it will clearly serve. There is a distressing number of typographical er- rors, most of which would have been noticed by careful proofreading. All but two of the titles in McAnany's ex- tensive bibliography lacked italics. Since this was the first effort by a new press, I am certain that the publisher will eliminate such errors in subsequent volumes. As a vehicle for the timely, affordable publication of the results of important conferences and other research this series pro- vides a vital service to academe. This volume demonstrates that even though compre- hensive studies of Maya lithics are only in their second decade, they already exhibit considerable sophistication, and in the future promise to be a major source of infor- mation on the role of stone tools in complex societies. Because Mesoamerican civilizations used flaked stone to a greater degree than did many complex societies of the Old World, Maya lithics offer us another vantage point from which to examine the economic development of early states. While not all the papers rise sufficiently above ty- pological issues to grapple with the behavioral implica- tions of lithic analysis, many of the contributors do engage in the processual dialogue Fowler calls for in the intro- ductory essay. The individual gems in this collection make the volume a worthwhile addition to the bookshelf of those interested in flaked stone tools at the substantive and theoretical levels.
