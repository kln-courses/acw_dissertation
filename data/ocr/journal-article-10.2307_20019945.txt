Thorstein Veblen and Max Weber: Two Studies The Metaphysics of Business: Thorstein Veblen John Wenzler Business enterprise, it is true, proceeds on metaphysical grounds and is swayed by con siderations of nominal wealth rather than material serviceability; but, none the less business enterprise and business metaphysics control the course of industry. The Theory of Business Enterprise Modern economic theorists, who generally consider themselves value free social scientists, often have been puzzled by the work of Thorstein Veblen. Although Veblen insisted that he too was an objective social sci entist, most of Veblen's readers have sensed that his theory expressed a powerful moral critique of American culture. For example, Veblen's famous concept of "conspicuous waste," which he defined as expenditure that "does not serve human life or human well being on the whole" seems to imply a prior moral judgement. One cannot decide what serves human well being without determining what humans ought to be. Yet, Veblen insisted that he employed his concept in a purely technical sense that implied "no depre cation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste."1 Although many of Veblen's readers have dis missed such assertions of objectivity as a humorous disguise that veiled Ve blen's moral purpose, Veblen's commitment to science seemed to be much more than an elaborate joke.2 Throughout his career, Veblen consistently claimed that he was a scientist rather than a moralist. In nearly all of his writings, Veblen championed the scientific point of view and repeatedly told his students that "we are interested in what is, not what ought to be."3 The only time that Veblen chose to respond publicly to criticism of his work, he did so in order to defend his objectivity against a critic who had argued that The Theory of the Leisure Class was moral philosophy disguised as social science.4 Veblen's insistence on his absolute scientific neutrality even as he employed loaded terms and definitions has prevented his inter preters from agreeing about his moral stance and thus about the broader significance of his work.5 In order to develop a more coherent account of Veblen's theoretical approach, I believe that we need better to understand the ambiguous in 541 ? 1998 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">542 Wenzler tellectual tradition that he confronted. Veblen insisted on separating sci entific facts from moral values throughout his career because he believed that the most insidious flaw of American capitalism was its tendency to transform values into facts. Veblen perceived this flaw in business enterprise because he was responding to a powerful tradition of American economic theory that had predicted that capitalism would unite scientific and moral law. Throughout the nineteenth century, popular American economists such as Henry C. Carey and Henry George had argued that the market place would produce and distribute moral virtue and spiritual freedom as efficiently as it would produce and distribute industrial resources. John Bates Clark, Veblen's teacher and the most influential American economist during Veblen's career, inherited this tradition and epitomized its faith in the harmony between science and morality. In his Distribution of Wealth, Clark argued that "the income of society is controlled by a natural law .... This law, if it worked without friction, would give to each agent of pro duction the amount of wealth which that agent creates."6 Through this natural/moral law, Clark believed that the system of private property would moralize the economic landscape of America so that one would be able to measure a man's virtue by means of his possessions. Even the critics of the American economy in Veblen's era often accepted this goal of uniting moral and natural law as the legitimate purpose of economic progress. They merely argued that American society had not yet realized the promises of the American dream because it had not yet distributed the commodities that symbolized moral virtue to those who had truly earned them.7 Veblen rejected these "metaphysical grounds" of American business enterprise, not only because he considered them false, but also because he considered them the chief source of dissension and despair in modern so ciety. Instead of believing that the effort to unify moral values with material facts justified capitalism, Veblen argued that it led men into a deadly world of illusion and violence. According to Veblen, it was the capitalist's meta physical desire for moral honor rather than his vulgar bodily needs that led to the social conflict and irrational waste of resources characteristic of capitalism. The businessman's effort to demonstrate his moral worth through the accumulation of physical wealth justified the military adven tures of imperialist politicians and undermined social solidarity. It led to a war of all against all in which men fought with each other for control of the commodities that would symbolize their virtue. For Veblen, therefore, the spiritual goals of American capitalism corrupted the flesh of industrial progress, and the moral promises of private property undermined the re ality of America's material abundance. In order to escape from the illusions of business metaphysics, Veblen attacked Clark's desire to harmonize moral truth with scientific law at its</page><page sequence="3">The Metaphysics of Business 543 philosophical roots. He did so by sharply distinguishing between "two di vergent methods of apprehending and systemizing the facts of experience" throughout his career. Veblen repeatedly contrasted the "spiritual," "per sonal," "ideological," or "animistic," method of interpreting experience with the "materialistic," "impersonal," "non-teleological," and "matter-of fact" method. All of these distinctions focused on the difference between the way that we explain the behavior of conscious, ideological, human agents and the way that we explain the motions of inanimate, nonteleologi cal, physical objects. Thus, the fundamental epistemological idea at the heart of Veblen's thought was a categorical distinction between people and things or between mind and matter. This basic distinction led to Veblen's effort to segregate facts from values because Veblen assumed that only hu man minds?and not the phenomena of nature?were capable of formu lating and acting upon moral beliefs.8 Although this idea seems obvious when stated so baldly, it became central to Veblen's criticism of business enterprise because he believed that business metaphysics turned this obvi ous relationship between agents and objects up side down. According to Veblen, businessmen and political economists constantly tended to impute moral agency to natural phenomena at the same time they ignored the moral agency of human beings. By focusing on Veblen's effort to maintain this categorical distinction between people and things, we can begin to understand Veblen's theory as a more coherent whole. The dichotomy between agents and objects led to the other important dichotomies of Veblen's theory such as his distinctions between modern science and political economy, between the laboring class and the business class, and between industrial and pecuniary employments. According to Veblen, modern scientists, industrial workers, and engineers all focused on controlling and manipulating the inanimate processes of na ture. Their philosophical point of view was governed by their emphasis on the relationship between people and things. Political economists, the leisure classes, and businessmen, in contrast, focused on controlling and exploiting other spiritual agents. Their philosophical point of view was governed by their emphasis on coercive and competitive relationships between people. The distinction between agents and objects also led to Veblen's explanation of private property as a leisure class institution that undermined the dif ference between people and things. In addition, it was central to Veblen's analysis of the business cycle, which was caused by conflict between the industrial worker's effort to increase man's power over inanimate nature and the businessman's effort to dominate other people. Once we understand the central importance of this distinction between people and things to Veblen's analysis of modern society, we will also be better able to understand his moral ambiguities. Veblen found it difficult</page><page sequence="4">544 Wenzler to articulate a consistent moral relationship between the social scientist and society because society is neither a person nor a thing. Unlike individual human beings, society is not a conscious teleological agent, but unlike bio logical evolution, society is not a completely mechanical and amoral process either. As such, society did not fit neatly into Veblen's epistemological cate gories. In order to avoid the error of economists like Clark, who thought of the economy as a quasi-person that shared his own moral values, Veblen assumed that the moral beliefs of the social scientist were irrelevant to his analysis. Yet, Veblen could not avoid making implicit judgments about the ends that social life ought to achieve in his effort to explain the "waste" caused by capitalism. In addition, Veblen's assumption that society was a thing led him to underestimate the extent to which human values could shape society. He generally saw moral beliefs as "cultural lag" or as a de layed mental response to social development, rather than as an active cause of social change. This prevented him from fully articulating alternative val ues that could challenge the perverse values of the businessmen that he criticized. But this is getting ahead of the argument. Before we can look at Veblen's alternatives to business enterprise, we have to understand why Veblen considered business values perverse. DARWINIAN SCIENCE VERSUS POLITICAL ECONOMY Veblen's famous claim that economics was "not an evolutionary sci ence" was not simply a complaint about the static mathematical formulas of classical economics, which were incapable of explaining the dynamic process of social change. Veblen acknowledged that "efforts to formulate and explain schemes of process, sequence, growth, and development" abounded in "pre-evolutionary" science. The essential difference between Darwinian science and political economy went much deeper than this. It was "a difference of spiritual attitude or point of view ... a difference in the basis of valuation of the facts for the scientific purpose."9 Economics had failed to become a Darwinian science because its fundamental philo sophical preconceptions differed from those of modern scientists. The "spiritual attitude" of modern science, according to Veblen, consisted of two epistemological assumptions. First, modern scientists assumed that non-human events or processes never could be explained by attributing tele ological purpose or meaning to them. Second, modern scientists assumed individual human behavior only could be explained by attributing teleologi cal goals to the human mind. The pre-Darwinian "spiritual attitude" of political economy, in contrast, imputed spiritual agency to the economic process as a whole while it denied the agency of individual human actors.</page><page sequence="5">The Metaphysics of Business 545 Veblen's historical account of the modern scientific point of view fo cused on humanity's increasing tendency to separate the mind from the impersonal phenomena of nature. Primitive cultures, according to Veblen, made no sharp distinction between actions of human beings and the events of the natural universe. Because they assumed that animals, trees, and riv ers had intellectual motives much like their own, they populated the uni verse with a multitude of non-human spiritual agents. "Primitive people [were] guided by animistic norms. They [made] up their cosmological schemes and the like, in terms of personal or quasi-personal activity, and the whole [was] thrown into something of a dramatic form."10 Because primitive mythology explained the patterns of nature by imputing human purposes to natural events, the primitive universe became a vast play in which the aims, emotions, and ideals characteristic of human agents within society expressed themselves on a cosmic scale. Primitive cultures also sought to alter the natural environment in the same way that they sought to influence other human beings. Magic rituals and religious ceremonies were attempts to persuade the spiritual agents of nature to pursue ends that corresponded to the ends of particular groups of people. Along with this mythology of nature, however, Veblen argued that primitive societies necessarily had developed a body of matter-of-fact knowledge similar to the knowledge sought by modern scientists. In addi tion to knowing about the personalities who governed the universe, "they [knew] equally well the matter of fact that water runs down hill, that two stones are heavier than one of them, that a pointed stick may be stuck in the ground, and the like."11 Veblen called these "generalizations from ex perience" industrial or lower knowledge, as opposed to the higher knowl edge of myth and theology. Although most people throughout human history had had a livelier interest in higher knowledge because it gave more freedom to human creativity, Veblen argued that the survival of a society depended on its stock of industrial knowledge. Religious attempts to modify nature by appealing to the spiritual forces that governed it failed to provide food, shelter, and clothing as effectively as mechanical attempts to manipu late nature conceived of as an impersonal sequence of facts. Modern science developed, according to Veblen, as industrial knowl edge of impersonal sequences increasingly encroached upon the higher realm of myth and theology. He argued that "the guiding hand of a spiritual agency or a propensity in events becomes less readily traceable as men's knowledge of things grows ampler and more searching."12 As a society gained more knowledge, it became harder to impute spiritual consistency to nature without contradicting known sequences of facts. Consequently, mythologists were forced to populate the universe with fewer spiritual agents, and those spirits that continued to exist receded into the back</page><page sequence="6">546 Wenzler ground where they seldom interfered with daily life. Darwin's Origins of Species represented the culmination of this process of dehumanizing nature because Darwin had explained the evolution of the entire biological uni verse without referring to any prime mover outside of the facts themselves. By demonstrating that the "colorless impersonal sequence of cause and ef fect can be made use of for theory proper, by virtue of its cumulative char acter," Darwin had banished all teleological agents from his account of the universe.13 In the late nineteenth century, natural scientists in all fields of research increasingly had adopted the same approach. For these modern scientists, "esoteric knowledge of matter-of-fact" had replaced "the more emotional and spiritual virtues that once held the first place" as the central goal of man's idle curiosity.14 Not all modern thinkers were willing to accept the mechanistic con sequences of Darwinian science, however. Romantic philosophers, accord ing to Veblen, resisted the point of view of modern science by continuing to look for some sort of quasi-spiritual force behind the facts of nature that would direct them toward the accomplishment of humanly meaningful ends. Although they no longer were able to believe in the multitude of spiritual agents that had populated primitive mythologies, Romantics still looked for some sort of dramatic consistency in the processes of nature as a whole. Hegel's teleological philosophy, which argued that the emancipa tion of the human spirit was the "end" of human history, was a perfect example of Romanticism according to Veblen. Hegel was not content to describe the facts of history and to explain their efficient causes but had to find the ultimate meaning of these facts. For Veblen, this desire to infuse scientific facts with meaning or value always distorted the post-Darwinian scientists' effort to discover impersonal, cause and effect, sequences. Unlike Hegelian philosophy, Darwinian natural science was a "scheme of blindly cumulative causation, in which there is no trend, no final term, no con summation. The sequence is controlled by nothing but the vis a tergo of brute causation, and is essentially mechanical."15 Facts were "opaque" to the modern scientist because they were the beginning and the end of his research, and he did not try to look beyond them to discover their signifi cance. Conventional economic theory, according to Veblen, shared the Ro mantic preconceptions of Hegelian history. Like Hegel, but unlike modern scientists, political economists perceived a "meliorative trend" within the course of events. Economic theory imputed "to things a tendency to work out what the instructed common sense of the time accepts as the adequate or worthy end of human effort. It is a projection of the accepted ideal of conduct."16 Much like primitive mythologists, economists assumed that the economic system as a whole was a spiritual agent that sought to achieve</page><page sequence="7">The Metaphysics of Business 547 goals similar to the goals of the human agents within their society. Adam Smith's metaphor of the "unseen hand," which suggested that an invisible animistic agent guided the economic process toward the ends desired by Smith better than individual human beings, perfectly expressed these tele ological preconceptions of political economy. More recent economists, al though they might have rejected Smith's metaphor, continued to analyze the economy as if it the marketplace was governed by a conscious tele ological purpose. They believed that they had theoretically explained an economic phenomenon, such as money or credit, when they had demon strated "the end which, 'in the normal case,' it should work out according to the given writer's ideal of economic life, rather than in terms of causal relation."17 To explain a phenomenon, for a political economist, was to de scribe the moral values that the phenomenon ought to achieve. Because modem economists continued to explain economic processes by looking for the spiritual or human motives that governed them, Veblen believed that they were incapable of discovering impersonal and mechanical relationships between economic facts.18 The economist's Romantic desire to impute teleological agency to the nonhuman processes was not the only philosophical difference between modern science and political economy, however. Political economy also dif fered from modern science because it tended to deny spiritual agency to the human mind. At the same time that Darwinian science was eliminating agency from the natural universe, according to Veblen, modern psychology and anthropology were emphasizing that individual human behavior had to be the result of conscious purposeful action. Veblen argued that the "later psychology, and the sciences which build on this later psychology, insist upon and find ... a teleological trend" in "individual conduct."19 Veblen's "instinct of workmanship" emphasized this assumption of tele ological purpose within individual behavior. According to Veblen, work manship had to be an instinct because "as a matter of selective necessity, man is an agent. . . seeking in every act the accomplishment of some con crete, objective, impersonal end. By force of his being such an agent he is possessed of a taste for effective work, and a distaste for futile effort."20 Because the process of evolution had provided human beings with the fore sight that enabled them to anticipate the consequences of their actions, people were spiritual agents. This meant that it was not possible to explain human action without understanding the teleological purposes of the hu man agent as well as the environment in which he found himself. As natural scientists increasingly banished all other agents from the universe, there fore, scholars were beginning to recognize that the meaning and purpose that continued to exist in their experience had emanated from the human mind.</page><page sequence="8">548 Wenzler Political economy had failed to this achieve this recognition, however, because it had adopted "as a matter of course or of common notoriety" the hedonist psychology developed by early nineteenth-century Utilitarian philosophers.21 Hedonism, according to Veblen, eliminated the human mind as an active agent by reducing all human motives to the physiological desire to achieve pleasure and avoid pain. Veblen expressed this idea forcefully in a famous passage of "Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science." Here, he claimed that the hedonistic man was: an isolated, definitive human datum, in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another. Self-imposed in elemental space, he spins symmetrically about his own spiritual axis until the parallelogram of forces bears down upon him, whereupon he follows the line of the resultant. When the force of the impact is spent, he comes to rest, a self-con tained globule of desire as before. Spiritually the hedonistic man is not a prime mover. (My emphasis) By trying to study human behavior in the same way that Darwinian scien tists studied natural phenomena, hedonists suggested that teleological pur pose was as irrelevant to human action as it was to the motion of a cannon ball. They were thus moving in the exactly opposite direction of modern psychologists. Veblen employed the instinct of workmanship to argue that these he donistic assumptions made political economy irrelevant from the perspec tive of a modern science of human behavior. If man was an agent "possessed by a taste for effective work," according to Veblen, then "pleas ure . . . [resulted] from the attainment of some already existing end of ac tion; it [was] not itself an end."23 Human activity was not something incidental to the process of saturating given desires. The activity is itself the substantial part of the process, and the desires under whose guidance the action takes place are circumstances of temperament which determine the specific direction in which the activity will unfold itself in the given case.24 In other words, Veblen believed that pleasure could not be the final goal of human action because a person's chief source of pleasure in life was the successful accomplishment of whatever goal he already wanted to achieve. Whereas the hedonists had assumed that man's universal desire for sensual pleasure determined his mental ends, therefore, Veblen argued that a man's "already existing" spiritual ends determined what would please him. The significance of this distinction is evident in difference between the hedonist's analysis of the motives of business enterprise and Veblen's analy sis. According to the hedonists, a businessman tried to make as much money as possible for the same reason that any human being did any thing?so that he could maximize his desire "to procure the pleasurable</page><page sequence="9">The Metaphysics of Business 549 sensations of consumption." According to Veblen, in contrast, "business men habitually aspire to accumulate wealth in excess of the limits of prac ticable consumption, and the wealth so accumulated is not intended to be converted by a final transaction of purchase into consumable goods or sen sations of consumption."25 This meant that making money was an "already existing" teleological end in itself for the capitalist, which gave him spiritual satisfaction regardless of the sensual pleasures that money could buy. Thus, Veblen believed that the important questions about business enterprise, from the perspective of modern science, focused on the origins and con sequences of this spiritual imperative to make as much money as possible. Where and when did it arise? What were its consequences for the social and economic life of the community? How did the businessman's spiritual goal of accumulation differ from the spiritual goals pursued by other human agents within the businessman's community or by other human agents in other communities? Conventional economists, because their preconceptions reduced all human motives to the universal desire to achieve pleasure and avoid pain, could not even ask these questions about the teleological pur poses of business enterprise or of any other human endeavor. Although, at first glance, the hedonistic attempt to deny teleological agency to people seems to contradict the Romantic attempt to impute agency to things, Veblen argued that these two preconceptions reinforced each other within conventional economic theory. In order to believe that the "meliorative trend" that they had imputed to the economic process governed the economy as a whole, economists had to assume that no discretion resides in the intermediate terms through which the end is worked out. Therefore man being such an intermediate term, discretion cannot be imputed to him without violating the supposition. Therefore, given an indefeasible meliora tive trend in events, man is but a mechanical intermediary in the sequence. It is as such a mechanical intermediate term that the stricter hedonism construes human nature.26 In order for the economic system to have its own end, human beings had to become mere means, mechanical tools employed by the invisible hand in its effort to allocate human resources beneficently. By looking for tele ology in all the wrong places, therefore, economists had allowed the spiri tual purpose that they had imputed to nonhuman economic processes to usurp the purposes of individual human beings. Economists were not, however, the only people in modern society to see human beings as means rather than ends. For Veblen, the contrast be tween modern science and political economy not only demonstrated the difference between the spiritual attitudes of two groups of intellectuals but also the difference between the points of view of the two major classes in modern society. The industrial or working class, according to Veblen, was</page><page sequence="10">550 Wenzler most likely to adopt the point of view of modern science. Because workers earned their livelihood by altering the inanimate environment of nature, the matter-of-fact preconceptions of Darwinian science were necessary to them in their daily activities. The business class, in contrast, was much more likely to adopt the point of view of political economy. Because they earned their livelihood by manipulating the spiritual environment of other people, the materialistic conclusions of Darwinian science were irrelevant in the daily activity of a businessman. Furthermore, the pecuniary occupations of businessmen, unlike the industrial occupations of laborers, made them more likely to adopt the hedonistic idea that people were mere means rather than independent spiritual agents. To understand this argument, however, we need to see how Veblen's distinction between manipulating people and manipulating things shaped his theory of the social classes. LEISURE, LABOR, AND BUSINESS Veblen's leisure class was not a group of people who did nothing or even a group of people who did things that we would normally think of as leisurely activities. Of the four occupations that Veblen specifically at tributed to the leisure class, "government, warfare, religious observances, and sports," only sports would immediately strike the modern American as a form of leisure. Warfare, religion, and even government seem to be the opposite of leisure because they are serious endeavors that one would not pursue merely for the sake of relaxation or recreation. But relaxation and recreation were not the fundamental spiritual goals of Veblen's leisure class. The feature that united all of the leisure-class occupations into a single category, for Veblen, was that they were all endeavors in which men sought to conquer other spiritual agents, either human or divine. Veblen's leisure class was the class that acquired its economic goods and achieved its social standing by dominating other agents. The industrial class, in con trast, was the class that acquired its economic goods by altering the inani mate environment to make it more suitable for human existence. The leisure class manipulated people; the industrial class manipulated things. The business class, according to Veblen, was essentially a modem mani festation of the leisure class that employed the leisure class institution of private property to conquer and control other human agents. The modem businessman's quest to accumulate capital like the medieval aristocrat's quest for military glory was a spiritual attempt to dominate other agents through metaphysical signs and symbols. There was, however, an important difference between the modern businessman and the old-fashioned aristo crat. Whereas the traditional aristocrat openly expressed his disdain for the</page><page sequence="11">The Metaphysics of Business 551 vulgar occupations of the laboring class, the modern businessman was con vinced that his metaphysical endeavors somehow improved the material well-being of society as a whole. Although, in reality, the businessman spent his days exploiting other people like the medieval lord, he believed that he was altering the inanimate environment like the industrial worker. This am biguity in the social role of the businessman led to the ambiguous precon ceptions of political economy, which thoroughly conflated the difference between exploiting people and manipulating things. Veblen's counterintuitive description of business enterprise as form of leisure arose out of his genetic analysis of modern society, which divided social history into four basic stages: the era of savagery, the barbarian era, the era of handicraft industry, and the era of machine production. Accord ing to Veblen, the industrial class arose in the era of savagery and remained consistent throughout history, although it lost most of its cultural prestige in later eras. The leisure class arose in the barbarian era and gradually evolved into the business class through the eras of handicraft industry and machine production. By looking at these origins of business enterprise, we can better understand why Veblen thought of leisure as the spiritual domi nation of other people and how business enterprise became an unacknow ledged form of leisure. The era of savagery was the first and longest period of human history, according to Veblen. In this stage of civilization, every individual in a com munity had to engage in productive labor because the primitive state of industrial knowledge prevented the society from producing an economic surplus that could feed non-producers. Individuals within the savage society also had to cooperate with each other in the distribution of economic sup plies so that everyone would get enough resources to maintain his or her capacity for work. The cooperation thus imposed on the savages by the niggardliness of nature meant that the dominant spiritual feature of this presumptive initial phase of culture seems to have been an unreflecting solidarity largely expressing itself in a complacent, but by no means strenuous, sympathy with all facility of human life, and an uneasy revulsion against apprehended inhibition or futility of life.27 There were no class distinctions in this savage society and industry was "organized on the ground of workmanship alone." Although the savages did engage in mythological speculations about the spiritual agents who con trolled their natural environment, their mythologies were simply an attempt to satisfy their idle curiosity and had little economic significance. Because the key to the material well being of both the individual and of the com munity as a whole was the community's joint ability to manipulate the im personal sequences of nature, interpersonal conflict had few economic consequences for the savage.</page><page sequence="12">552 Wenzler The transition from this classless state of society to the barbarian stage of culture, in which the leisure class arose?"the most universal and most radical mutation which human culture has undergone in its advance from savagery to civilization"?was marked by the increasing economic signifi cance of interpersonal conflict. As the barbarian's predatory culture emerged, the character of the struggle for existence changed in some degree from a struggle of the group against a non-human environment to a struggle against a human en vironment. This change was accompanied by an increasing antagonism and a con sciousness of antagonism between individual members of the group.28 Although Veblen could never fully explain how and why a formerly peace able and cooperative society would become predatory and competitive, he did argue that this change would have been impossible before it became productive enough to produce a surplus. In contrast to most nineteenth century economists, who had assumed that scarcity provoked social conflict and that abundance would lead to social harmony, Veblen believed that economic scarcity forced men to cooperate but that abundance gave them the freedom to engage in the interpersonal battles that characterized high culture. "Force and fraud" were the chief means by which the emerging leisure class of a barbarian society harvested the economic surplus produced by its human environment. Warrior classes liberated themselves from the vul gar requirements of industrial labor by appropriating the excess production of others through force. Priestly classes elevated themselves above the com mon herd by the more subtle means of fraud. They transformed primitive mythologies into economic assets by trading the intangible threats and promises of nonhuman spiritual agents for tangible economic goods. Be cause the demands of the spiritual agents imputed to nature were immeas urable and indefinitely extensible, there was "no limit to the value of such ministrations except the limit of tolerance, 'what the traffic will bear.'"29 This meant that priestly fraud could usually appropriate the entire surplus that the warriors did not acquire through force. As warriors and priests began to dominate the human environment, the barbarian society was di vided into two classes. The industrial class continued to obtain its subsis tence by manipulating the impersonal environment as the savages had done, but the leisure class now focused on spiritual conquest and no longer had direct contact with the matter-of-fact natural environment in its eco nomic activities. At the same time that the leisure class freed itself from industrial la bor, it also developed a code of cultural values that stressed the moral superiority of leisure-class occupations. The fundamental idea at the heart of barbarian culture, according to Veblen, was the invidious distinction be</page><page sequence="13">The Metaphysics of Business 553 tween "exploit" and "drudgery." Exploit implied the power to transform other teleological agents into means rather than ends. "In so far as it results in an outcome useful to the agent" exploit involved "the conversion to his own ends of energies previously directed to some other end by another agent."30 In the mind of the barbarian, a successful act of exploit signified the spiritual superiority of the exploiter because he had succeeded in im posing his will on another agent. The quest for honor, dignity, and nobility that motivated aristocrats in a barbarian culture was thus a quest to domi nate others. "With the primitive barbarian . . . 'honorable' seems to con note nothing else than the assertion of superior force. 'Honorable' is 'formidable,' 'worthy' is 'proponent.' An honorific act is in the last analysis little if anything else than a recognized successful act of aggression."31 Al though the aristocratic concept of honor did acquire additional connota tions through time, it never lost its original meaning, and Veblen considered the idea of a nonexploiting nobility to be a contradiction in terms. In contrast to the spiritual conquests implied by exploit, drudgery was the industrial act of making "new things" out of "inert" material. Because the working drudge merely confronted an impersonal world that could not be exploited (because it had no ends of its own), drudgery could never confer prestige on the drudge no matter how efficient he became in his work. Not only did drudgery lack honor in and of itself, but the leisure class also exploited those who engaged in drudgery. In the barbarian mind, therefore, the men and women who worked for a living were doubly de graded because they lacked the spiritual power to resist domination by other agents. Eventually, industrial labor, which had been satisfying to the savage because he possessed a native instinct for workmanship, became "irksome" to the barbarian. Labor became vulgar, ignoble, and base and it remained so as modern civilization developed. "The nobility of labor," Veblen observed, "is a disingenuous figure of speech" because the entire concept of nobility had been built on the exploitation of labor and the invidious denigration of industry. Perhaps the most paradoxical manifestation of the leisure class's cele bration of exploit and disdain for labor was conspicuous waste. Conspicuous waste was essentially a form of exploit directed against the industrial proc ess itself. Because the ostensible purpose of labor was to contribute to the material well-being of humanity, the best way for an aristocrat to demon strate his power over industry was to channel labor into actions that failed to improve human welfare. An aristocrat, for example, hired menial ser vants and bought his wife expensive clothes that incapacitated her for labor not because these actions contributed to anyone's physical happiness, but because such displays of wasted labor demonstrated his honor. A member of the leisure class constantly had to waste at least as much as his neighbors</page><page sequence="14">554 Wenzler or he would risk losing his moral standing. This institution of "conspicu ously wasteful honorific expenditure" demonstrated that the leisure class sought wealth primarily because it satisfied their "spiritual well-being" rather than "the 'lower' wants of physical well-being or sustenance only."32 If the purpose of exploitation merely had been to satisfy the material needs of the exploiter, conspicuous waste would have been counterproductive and the limits of exploitation would have been narrow. Because exploitation and the invidious moral prestige that it conferred on the aristocrat had become teleological ends in themselves, however, the barbarian's capacity for accumulation and oppression was as boundless as his desire for spiritual transcendence. For the leisure class, therefore, personal conflict between spiritual agents had become both the means and the end of economic endeavor. Humanity's direct confrontation with the nonteleological environment, either in the production of physical goods or in the satisfaction of physical desires, came to seem vulgar to leisure class sensibilities. This exclusive emphasis on interpersonal struggle meant that leisure class schemes of knowledge focused almost exclusively on teleological agents and that "the vulgar facts of industry [were] beneath the dignity of a feudalistic deity." The purest version of leisure-class philosophy, according to Veblen, was medieval scholasticism, "in which the imputed degree of nobility and pre potency of the objects and the symbolic force of their names are looked to for an explanation of what takes place."33 Scholasticism assumed that all of the objects in the universe shared the aristocrat's obsession with "re lations of personal mastery and subservience and the ideals of personal gain." This thoroughgoing philosophy of invidious animism made the lei sure class's learning useless for the material survival of the community. In fully developed barbarian societies such as medieval Europe, the matter of-fact knowledge necessary for the survival of civilization was maintained "only in the obscure depths of vulgar life among those neglected elements of the population that lived below the reach of the active class struggle."34 The impersonal ideals of modern science were "more nearly akin to the spiritual life of the serfs and villeins than ... to the grange or abbey." So far, if this cultural analysis of leisure had been a purely historical account of an extinct class, many defenders of capitalism in Veblen's era might have agreed with it. In fact, Veblen built his theory of barbarian society largely on the sociological arguments of Herbert Spencer and Wil liam Graham Sumner, two staunch defenders of laissez-faire capitalism.35 Like Veblen, Spencer and Sumner had argued that the moral and legal system of medieval Europe had focused on a man's personal status and prestige rather than on abstract and impersonal laws. What made Veblen's analysis radically different from theirs, however, was his claim that the capi</page><page sequence="15">The Metaphysics of Business 555 talist institution of private property had originated in the barbarian era and continued to promote the predatory values of the leisure class rather than the scientific values of labor. According to Veblen, ownership was "the im mediate function of the leisure class proper. . . . The conventional leisure class and the institution of ownership as a conventional and equitable claim to extraneous things are results of the same economic force."36 This asser tion allowed Veblen to argue that the leisure class's obsession with exploit pervaded modern capitalism in a way that Spencer and Sumner would have denied. Whereas they believed that laissez-faire capitalism had replaced the status society of medieval Europe with a society based on impersonal con tracts and natural law, Veblen argued that modern capitalism had univer salized the spiritual conflicts of the aristocracy. By providing every individual in society with the opportunity to gain moral prestige through the accumulation of property, capitalism had incited a war of all against all in which everyone sought to conquer his neighbors. In order to make this argument, Veblen first had to demonstrate that ownership was social institution rather than a scientific fact of nature, as many economists believed it to be. He argued that the idea of ownership? that one man to the exclusion of all others has the right to control a par ticular physical object?was not implicit in the material facts of nature. Knowing about who owned an object did not provide the scientist with new information about its matter-of-fact characteristics or about its indus trial uses. Because ownership was thus irrelevant to the mechanistic se quences of Darwinian science, it was a spiritual fact imputed to the physical universe by human beliefs. It was "a conventional fact and has to be learned; it [was] a cultural fact which has grown into an institution in the past through a long course of habituation."37 Because ownership was a so cial belief rather than a physical fact, a social scientist had to analyze own ership in the same way that a historian or an anthropologist would analyze any other system of beliefs. To understand the meaning of ownership, one would have to ask why a culture would begin to impute this kind of spiritual relationship between men and things. Because the notion of dominance and subservience was implicit in the concept of ownership, Veblen argued that it would have arisen only in the barbarian era of culture when men had begun to think about human rela tionships in terms of dominance and subservience. The idea of ownership would have made little sense in a savage era of society for two reasons. First, disputes about the distribution of ownership rights, an inevitable con sequence of the institution of ownership for Veblen, would have been fatal to a society that depended so heavily on the cooperative production and distribution of material goods. More importantly, savages would not have imputed coercive social relationships between themselves and the objects</page><page sequence="16">556 Wenzler of the nonhuman world because the social relationships between human savages themselves were so peaceable. A genial savage would be likely "to emphasize the peaceable, non-coercive character of the divine order of things." Only in the barbarian era, therefore, when men began to think of each other as masters and servants, would they believe that inanimate ob jects also could become their masters or their servants. Within the barbarian era, Veblen traced ownership specifically to the social institutions in which the master/servant relationship had originated? slavery and patriarchal marriage. He speculated that early in the barbarian era groups of raiders would attack other communities to steal women and food. While these early barbarians probably would have distributed the in animate resources that they acquired equitably amongst themselves for the sake of their mutual survival, each warrior would have been tempted to exert exclusive control over his female captives. For a barbarian, the pros pect of possessing a woman would have been much more attractive than the prospect of possessing inanimate articles of consumption. Because women were clearly teleological agents, who had their own ends in life, "they [were] fit subjects for command and constraint; it minister[ed] to both his honor and vanity to domineer over them."38 By bossing around his cap tive wife, the warrior satisfied his cultural desire for exploit more immedi ately than he could have done by owning land, tools, or food. At the same time, his captives also became trophies, which demonstrated his prowess to his peers. After a long period in which the community became accus tomed to keeping slaves, therefore, "the captor comes to exercise a cus tomary right to exclusive use and abuse over the women he has seized." Veblen argued that "this customary right of use and abuse over an object which obviously is not an organic part of his person constitutes the rela tionship of ownership, as naively apprehended."39 The institution of own ership thus began as a relationship between a human master and a human servant, rather than as a relationship between people and things. Once a society had become accustomed to thinking about human re lationships in terms of ownership, however, they could begin to impute the same kind of relationship to inanimate objects. Veblen argued that "it be comes a relatively easy matter to extend this newly achieved concept of ownership to the products of the labor performed by the persons so held in ownership."40 Owners used the products produced by their slaves to sat isfy their material needs, of course, but they were even more valuable "as a conspicuous evidence of his possessing many and efficient servants, and they [were] therefore useful as an evidence of his superior force."41 Even tually, the fact that a man possessed many objects became a symbolic dem onstration of his prowess even if it was not obvious that he had acquired his wealth through the domination of other agents. Owning and consuming</page><page sequence="17">The Metaphysics of Business 557 the inanimate products of labor became a metaphorical means of owning and exploiting other human agents. This argument turned the conventional economic analyses of slavery and ownership on their heads. Because hedonist economists assumed that consumption was the teleological end of all economic action, they believed that men took slaves primarily so that they could acquire the products of slave labor. For them, the human relationship of slavery was simply a means by which the master altered his relationship to the inanimate universe. This meant that it was possible to separate the institution of private property from exploitative relationships between people. For Veblen, in contrast, the human relationship of slavery was the teleological end-in-itself of owner ship. Conspicuous consumption of the inanimate products of exploited la bor was primarily a metaphorical means of demonstrating that one had successfully exploited another agent. This meant that, for Veblen, it was impossible to separate the institution of ownership from coercive relation ships between human agents. In a peaceable and cooperative society, the metaphorical ownership of inanimate objects would cease to make sense because it would no longer be necessary to demonstrate one's honor and prowess. Although the cruder forms of slavery had been eliminated in mo dem capitalism, therefore, Veblen argued that the goal of the capitalist in his quest for property still was to achieve dominance over other members of his society. The primary difference between the modern businessman and the barbarian was that businessmen usually obtained their property and prestige through pecuniary exploits in the marketplace rather than through physical exploits of military combat. This spiritual analysis of the motives of accumulation explained why the quest for wealth seemed to be so insatiable even in a modern industrial society that had vastly increased its capacity to produce material goods. Because the desire for wealth was inherently competitive, no absolute amount of physical property would ever give a man satisfaction. If a man had less wealth than most of his neighbors, he would "live in chronic dis satisfaction with his present lot," but if he were lucky enough to reach the average level of wealth in his community, this chronic dissatisfaction will give place to a restless striving to place a widening pecuniary interval between himself and this average standard .... [T]he desire for wealth can scarcely be satisfied in any individual instance, and evidently a satiation of the average or general desire for wealth is out of the question. However widely or equally, or 'fairly,' it may be distributed, no general increase of the community's wealth can make any approach to satiating this need, the ground of which is the desire of everyone to excel everyone else in the accumulation of goods."42 For Veblen, therefore, the economic conflict and competition characteristic of the marketplace were not the means by which a capitalist economy dis</page><page sequence="18">558 Wenzler tributed resources efficiently but the teleological end in itself of the system of private property. Through the metaphor of property, everyone in modern society tried to become as selfish, wasteful, and oppressive as the traditional leisure class. Having described property as a leisure class institution consistent with the aristocrat's disdain for productive labor, Veblen still had to explain why modern businessmen and economists had come to believe that ownership rights promoted labor. In the twelfth century, when "the fact of a person's being engaged in industry was prima facie evidence that he could own noth ing," Veblen's analysis of property might have coincided with contemporary common sense. In nineteenth century, however, most businessmen would have been insulted by the suggestion that they had obtained their wealth through exploitation rather than through industrial service. Veblen thus had to explain how the businessman's belief that ownership was the result of industry had arisen out of aristocrat's distinction between ownership and drudgery. Veblen's effort to provide this explanation led to his analysis of the handicraft era that came between the barbarian era and the era of business enterprise. The handicraft era was a "hybrid growth," according to Veblen, which produced the hybrid social philosophy of "natural rights" that led to the confusion between facts and values characteristic of modem business enterprise. According to Veblen, European handicraft production originated with the "masterless men" who escaped from the control their feudal lords in the late-medieval period by moving into protected cities. By becoming a craftsman and selling his products in the petty markets that arose in this era, the masterless man could achieve a certain measure of economic in dependence from the feudal system. Because the handicraft worker was simultaneously creating useful objects and selling these objects in the mar ket, Veblen argued that "the habitual outlook and bias given by the handi craft system are of a twofold character?technological and pecuniary."43 In order to succeed, the handicraft worker had to combine a capacity for workmanship with a capacity for salesmanship. Like the medieval slave, he created useful objects out of inert material, but like the medieval priest, he manipulated the spiritual agents that he encountered in the marketplace through subtle forms of force and fraud. Because handicraft work thus com bined the impersonal workmanship of savages with the spiritual exploits of the aristocracy, Veblen described it as a "qualified or mitigated (sophisti cated) return to the spirit of savagery."44 The new cultural emphasis on the technological uses of matter-of-fact sequences led to the tremendous increase in productive power that marked the modern era. At the same time, however, the new emphasis on the pecuniary manipulation of man</page><page sequence="19">The Metaphysics of Business 559 by man led to the system of business enterprise, which would eventually waste much of this increase in the quest for invidious honor and prestige. The "natural rights" social philosophy that corresponded to this dual istic bias of handicraft labor also was a "hybrid growth, a blend of personal freedom and equality, on the one hand, and prescriptive rights on the other hand."45 The preconceptions of natural rights eliminated all of the privi leges, rights, and invidious distinctions of the feudal class system?except the rights of property. To the handicraft worker, the privileges of property, unlike other aristocratic privileges, seemed inviolable because they ap peared to come directly from man's relationship to nature rather than from his relationship to other men. From the perspective of a handicraft worker, ownership was a 'natural right,' in the sense that what a man has made, whatsoever he has mixed his labor with, that has thereby become his own to do with it as he will. He has extended over and infused into the material of his work something of that discre tionary force and control which in the nature of things, the masterless man of right exercises in the movements of his own person . . . Natural ownership is workman ship wrought out and stabilized in a material object.46 The masterless man was thought to own the products of his own labor in the same way that the slave master owned the products of his servant's labor. This idea lay at the heart of the classical labor theory of value; it suggested that the property possessed by a handicraft worker was morally equivalent to the amount of industrial labor that he had performed. From Veblen's perspective, this idea was anomalous from the start, and he thought that it was the foundation of the modern confusion between facts and values. For Veblen, the consequences of industrial labor neces sarily were mechanistic rather than personal or pecuniary. Labor was an effort to modify the inanimate environment in order to achieve an imper sonal end such as a functioning clock or a bountiful harvest. Because work manship sought to alter the impersonal sequences of nature, its consequences had to be measured in the matter-of-fact terms of science rather than in the personal terms of value and property. A man acquired property, in contrast, through his personal interactions with other people in society rather than through his workmanlike relationship with the inani mate universe. To say that the industrial work performed by a laborer was equivalent to the value of property that he had acquired was to confuse his pecuniary relationship to other men with his industrial relationship to the inanimate universe. Thus, natural rights falsely identified the exploits characteristic of the leisure class with the drudgery characteristic of indus trial workers. By doing so, it "contaminated" the instinct of workmanship "with the ideal of self-aggrandizement and the canons of invidious emula tion." Under this system, "even the serviceability of any given action or</page><page sequence="20">560 Wenzler policy for the common good comes to be rated in terms of the pecuniary gain which such conduct will bring to its author."47 Despite these inherent ambiguities, Veblen argued that the system of natural rights initially helped to stimulate labor and to protect workers. During the early handicraft era when the material equipment required for industrial production was inexpensive, many individual workers were able to acquire them, and the right to own their means of production gave them a measure of independence from aristocrats. As the technological progress stimulated by the new emphasis on workmanship began to replace handi craft industry with machine technology, however, the aristocratic heritage of the rights of ownership reasserted itself. Unlike handicraft production, modem machine production generally required large and expensive fixed equipment. It also required a large body of workmen to work interdepen dently rather than independently. When this integrated system of produc tion was combined with the individualistic moral and legal system based on the natural rights of property, those who owned again began to be sepa rated from those who worked. Generally, a few merchants and master craftsmen gained control over the expensive instruments of production and hired other workers as wage laborers. This produced an increasingly wide differentiation between workers and owners "which grew into a 'division of labor' between industry and business, between industrial and pecuniary occupations?a disjunction of ownership and its peculiar cares, privileges, and proficiency from workmanship."48 Consequently, the social structure of modern society was becoming remarkably similar to the social structure of medieval Europe. A large group of industrial workers produced the ma terial goods required by society while a small leisure/business class focused on spiritual conflict in the marketplace and wasted the excess production of labor in invidious displays of honor. Like the spiritual occupations of traditional leisure class, the pecuniary occupations of businessmen focused on the manipulation of people rather than on the manipulation of things. "The sagacity characteristic of the pe cuniary employments is chiefly a sagacity in judging what persons will do in the face of given pecuniary circumstances."49 Furthermore, businessmen usually profited from these personal transactions through force and fraud, as had the traditional aristocrats. Generally, they employed force with their employees and fraud with their customers. Although the business class lacked some of the legal and conventional powers that the traditional lei sure class had exorcised over its slaves, the rights of property gave busi nessmen the balance of power in wage bargains. Because the ownership rights of businessmen allowed them to control access to the essential pieces of equipment required in the industrial process, they had the power to cre ate unemployment or to sabotage production unless industrial workers</page><page sequence="21">The Metaphysics of Business 561 agreed to their terms. The increased freedom of the modern worker and the tremendous productivity of modern technology made it difficult for the business class to waste all of the excess production of modern industry, but they came close to the standards set by the medieval leisure class. At the same time that businessmen acquired power similar to that of medieval lords over their workforce, they also were acquiring power similar to that of the medieval church over their customers. Veblen often compared the advertisers employed by modern corporations to the "salesmen of the faith" employed by other religious institutions. In a particularly bitter pas sage of Absentee Ownership, Veblen suggested that there was little differ ence between the indulgences and relics produced by the medieval church and consumer products produced by modern corporations. He claimed that the propaganda of the faith is quite the largest, oldest, most magnificent, . . . and most lucrative enterprise in sales-publicity in all Christendom. ... No pronounce ment on rubber-heels, soap-powder, lip-sticks, or yeast-cakes, not even Sapphia Buncombe's Vegetative Compound, are yet able to ignore material facts with the same magisterial detachment, and none has yet commanded the same unreasoning assent or acclamation.50 Like ancient priests modern advertisers sought to transform the spiritual anxieties of the population into an economic asset. They enhanced the sal ability of their commodities by imputing magical powers to them so that they could relieve the stresses and satisfy the dreams provoked by modern life. Although salesmen had not yet become as successful in ignoring the material facts of life as had traditional preachers, their aims and methods were the same. Veblen noted that "it is of the nature of sales-publicity to promise much and deliver a minimum. . . . Worked out to its ideal finish, as in the promises and performances of the publicity agents of the Faith, it should be the high good fortune of the perfect salesman in the secular field also to promise everything and deliver nothing."51 As businessmen became like modern aristocrats, however, the continu ing influence of natural rights theory prevented them from acknowledging that they were exploiting industry rather than aiding it. A modern capitalist could not denigrate industry like an old-fashioned aristocrat because natu ral rights theory suggested that his property rights were legitimate only if he had somehow produced his fortune through his own labor. Although the vast private fortunes accumulated by modem captains of finance made this idea seem ridiculous from the materialistic perspective of modern sci ence, economic theory helped businessmen to maintain their faith. Political economy offered businessmen a mythology of "production" that completely ignored the industrial process of producing material goods so that they could believe that acquiring property rights was the moral and spiritual</page><page sequence="22">562 Wenzler equivalent of creating useful objects. As Veblen argued in The Theory of Business Enterprise, The institutional animus of ownership, as it took shape under the discipline of early modern handicraft, awards the ownership of property to the worker who has pro duced it. By a dialectical conversion of the terms, this metaphysical dictum is made to fit the circumstances of later competitive business by construing acquisition of property to mean production of wealth; so that a businessman is looked upon as the putative creator of what he acquires. By force of this sophistication, the acqui sition of property by any person is held to be, not only expedient for the owner, but meritorious as an action serving the common good.52 This myth was the intellectual foundation of business metaphysics. It was John Bates Clark's natural law of distribution, which gave to every agent in the economy exactly what he had produced. By transforming the pecu niary exploits of modern businessmen into acts of industrial service, eco nomic mythology completely replaced objective facts of modern industry with the moral values implicit in the natural rights of property. The main alternative to this metaphysics of business in modern society was science and the "discipline of the machine." At the same time that the business class was beginning to focus almost exclusively on the spiritual realm of market transactions, the machine process was teaching the work ing class to think like Darwinian scientists. Workers did engage in pecuniary transactions to some extent because they bargained over their wages and had to buy their supplies in the marketplace, but they spent most of their time on the job. At work, the primary goal of the industrial employee was to make the industrial process operate as efficiently as possible. This meant adopting the preconceptions of modern science because: the machine process compels a more or less unremitting attention to phenomena of an impersonal character to the sequences and correlations not dependent for their force upon human predilection nor created by habit and custom The machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought. If (the worker) takes to myth mak ing and personifies the machine or the process and imputes purpose and benevo lence to the mechanical appliances ... he is sure to go wrong.53 Just as scientists were eliminating nonhuman spiritual agents from their account of the universe, the machine process was eliminating teleological beliefs from the experience of industrial workers. This meant that the myths of political economy and the quasi-personal relationship between an owner and his possessions that had become so important to businessmen were becoming meaningless to modern engineers and industrial laborers in their daily work. At the same time, machine technology was also was destroying the aristocratic assumption that all men were engaged in a perpetual compe tition for prestige and honor. Veblen argued that machine process created an "industrial republic," in which the individualistic values of the leisure</page><page sequence="23">The Metaphysics of Business 563 class were counterproductive. In the modern process of production, differ ent industries were dependent on cooperation with each other, and "the higher the degree of development reached by a given industrial community, the more comprehensive and urgent becomes this requirement of intersti tial adjustment."54 Conflicts and disturbances at any point in this industrial process tended to disrupt the system for everyone. This encouraged "soli darity in the management of the entire industrial traffic of the community." Consequently, the businessman's tendency to think in terms of competition and conflict, like his tendency to impute anthropomorphic relationships to the physical world, was alien to the habits of thought inculcated by modem technology. Veblen believed?or hoped?that the habituation of workers to this modem process of production eventually would convince them that the rights of property were as meaningless as the other aristocratic privi leges that the masterless men had eliminated. This would allow them to develop a social order based on the point of view of Darwinian science rather than on the mythology of natural rights. BUSINESS CRISES So far, then, we have argued that Veblen saw a growing cultural con flict in modern society between businessmen who focused on the domina tion of people and industrial workers who focused on the manipulation of things. The most telling economic consequence of this conflict were the business crises and depressions that characterized modem capitalism. Dur ing a business crisis, much of the industrial equipment and many of the industrial workers in a society were idle at the same time that the material needs of a large portion of the population remained unsatisfied. This was a phenomenon unique to the modern system of business enterprise. Al though premodern societies often had suffered through famines, they had not experienced privation while they were surrounded by industrial equip ment that could produce what they needed. These crises were important to Veblen's analysis of modern society because they demonstrated that "the exercise of free contract, and the other powers inhering in the natural right of ownership are incompatible with the modem machine technology."55 They occurred because the businessman's desire to maximize his pecuniary income often came into conflict with the industrial workers' desire to maxi mize physical production. Eventually, Veblen believed that the friction pro duced by depressions of increasing severity and length would destroy the hybrid combination of business and industry characteristic of the system of business enterprise.</page><page sequence="24">564 Wenzler In order to understand Veblen's explanation of business crises, we need to understand his theory of capital. Veblen argued that there were two dis tinct ways of measuring the utility of a capital good in modern society. From the perspective of the industrial worker or of the community at large, a capital good was an instrument required in the process of material pro duction. From the perspective of the businessman, however, capital was a means of acquiring a pecuniary income. Businessmen used their pecuniary control over essential tools to dominate the process of industry and to ex ploit workers and consumers. For them, the utility of a capital good de pended, not on its productive efficiency, but on its "earning potential" or its ability to divert the largest possible share of ownership rights into the hands of the businessman. Veblen argued that capital pecuniarily considered rests on a basis of subjective value; capital industrially considered rests on material circumstances reducible to objective terms of mechani cal, chemical, and physiological effects.56 Pecuniary capital was psychological or subjective because it was valuable to the extent that it enabled the capitalist to dominate other teleological agents. Industrial capital, in contrast, could be measured in matter-of-fact terms because it was useful to the extent that it helped the community to alter the inanimate environment. Because conventional economic mythol ogy had identified the process of acquiring property rights with the process of producing material goods, conventional economists had failed to per ceive this distinction between industrial and pecuniary capital. According to Veblen, this explained why they had failed to develop an adequate theory of business crises. Depressions were phenomena of busi ness, "of price, earning, and capitalization" rather than of "the mechanical facts of production and consumption." Crises occurred, not because a so ciety had somehow lost the industrial capital required to satisfy its material needs, but because businessmen were no longer able to make an adequate income on their pecuniary investments. They were "maladies of the affec tations" during which businessmen "did not see their way to derive a sat isfactory gain from letting the industrial process go forward on the lines and in the volume for which the material equipment is designed."57 This happened when there was a "discrepancy between that nominal capitaliza tion which (businessmen) have set their hearts upon through habituation in the immediate past and that actual capitalizable value of their property which its current earning-capacity will warrant."58 In order to understand business crises, therefore, one had to understand how and why the pecu niary value or the earning potential of capital investments would suddenly decrease for many capitalists throughout the economy. Veblen argued that there were two ways that this happened. Either a period of business pros</page><page sequence="25">The Metaphysics of Business 565 perity briefly inflated the value of pecuniary capital, leading to a crisis when the era of prosperity ended, or the rapid progress of industry depreciated the pecuniary value of investments faster than businessmen had anticipated. Business crises caused by inflation had occurred frequently between 1817 and 1873, a period marked by several cycles of boom and bust. Ac cording to Veblen, some form of wasteful extra-industrial expenditure that increased the demand for industrial products and raised prices generally had initiated the booms in this period. He noted that war, the preparation for war, and the protective tariff all had been effective means of creating business prosperity during the nineteenth century. All of these actions wasted resources and produced inefficiencies from the perspective of in dustry, but they increased the demand for vendible products, which was good for business. Famines, droughts, and other large-scale natural disasters would have had a similar stimulating effect according to Veblen's theory. When an extraindustrial event of this sort raised prices dramatically in a particular industry, the earning potential and therefore the capital value of its existing investments increased. Since modern businessmen measured the value of a company by predicting how much profit it would earn, rising prices increased the assets of a corporation without increasing its supply of physical capital. Once the nominal capital value of a company had in creased, however, it had more collateral, which allowed it to increase its credit and to expand its operations in an effort to earn even more profits. As the corporations initially effected by inflation expanded their operations, they bought more supplies thereby increasing the demand for products pro duced by other businesses. This lead to a cycle of higher prices, increased credit, and expanded operations that could spread prosperity to business men throughout the economy. Such an era of business excitement would continue as long as the wasteful disturbance kept up prices, and it often continued for a while after the disturbance had ceased. For a certain period, inflation could increase the profits of the business class, in general, because of "the relatively slow advance in the cost of labor during an era of prosperity." Veblen argued that: wages ordinarily are not advanced at all for a considerable period after such an era of prosperity has set in; and so long as the eventual advance of wages does not overtake the advance in prices ... so long, of course, a differential gain in the selling prices accrues, other things equal, to virtually all business enterprises.59 Although wages lagged behind other prices, workers did benefit from busi ness prosperity to some extent because they could find more work and longer hours at their previous rate of wages. Once the excess supply of unemployed labor had been absorbed into the economy, however, wages began to rise and the era of prosperity quickly ended for businessmen.</page><page sequence="26">566 Wenzler Higher wages increased the costs of production for businessmen throughout the economy thereby lowering the pecuniary value of capital assets. Just as higher prices for commodities increased the capital value of a business without increasing its industrial resources, higher wages decreased its capi tal value without decreasing its industrial resources. This decrease in the value of pecuniary capital not only ended the era of prosperity but lead to a crisis because businessmen had made loans and investments based upon the inflated capital values created by prosperity. As wages rose: the rate of earnings falls off; the enhanced capitalization based on enhanced puta tive earnings proves greater than the earnings realized or in prospect on the basis of an enhanced scale of expenses of production; the collateral consequently shrinks to a point where it will not support the credit extension resting on it in the way of outstanding contracts and loans.60 The decreased earning potential of capital thus made it impossible for many businessmen to pay interest on their loans, which were based on the inflated nominal value of their assets rather than on its current earning potential. Loans that had seemed conservative during prosperity began to look "un wise," and creditors began to call in their debts. Eventually, to a greater or lessor extent, liquidation ensued, and the industrial resources of the economy?with a lower pecuniary value?were concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer creditors. From the perspective of industry, there was no reason why such a "business" crisis also should lead to decreased material production. In all likelihood, the industrial capacity and efficiency of the economy had in creased during the period of prosperity. Although workers were receiving higher wages by the end of the boom, they obviously were not receiving more goods than they needed or could produce. Furthermore, although profit rates were decreasing, the material standard of living for most capi talists did not need to decrease. Few businessmen had to experience "hard ship in the way of a reduced command over the material means of the production, of life, or of comfort."61 The problem was that "business en terprise . . . proceeds on metaphysical grounds and is swayed by consid erations of nominal wealth rather than material serviceability."62 What mattered to a businessman was his social prestige, and "a businessman's rating in the business community . . . [rested] on the pecuniary magnitude of his holdings and his transactions, not on the mechanical serviceability of his output."63 This meant that businessmen considered a reduction in the value of their capital assets "a hardship" even if it failed to cause a reduction in their material standard of living. They sensed that there was something horribly wrong with an economic world that prevented them from earning the rate of profit that they had come to expect during the</page><page sequence="27">The Metaphysics of Business 567 era of prosperity. Thus, industrial production, although it was still required for the material well being of society, no longer seemed to be worthwhile from immaterial perspective of business. Businessmen stopped investing capital and producing goods until some new kind of wasteful stimulus led to another boom. Because "business metaphysics [controlled] the course of industry," therefore, the spiritual anxieties of the business class often had "grave consequences for industry and for the material welfare of the com munity."64 Although cycles of prosperity and crisis, as described above, had oc curred regularly in the mid-nineteenth century, Veblen argued that Ameri can business enterprise had been mired in a longer and more serious slump since the 1870s. Since 1873, according to Veblen, businessmen had suffered through a long period of depressed profits that had been interrupted only by short and infrequent booms.65 Veblen believed that this long business slump, which coincided with an era of tremendous industrial progress, dem onstrated that "chronic depression, more or less pronounced, is normal to business under the fully developed regime of the machine industry."66 This was true, according to Veblen, because the tremendous rate of technical progress in modern industry often destroyed the pecuniary hopes of busi nessmen all by itself. Like the cycle of boom and bust, technological pro gress tended to cause a discrepancy between the nominal capital value of a business enterprise and its current earning potential. Perhaps we can best illustrate how the constantly increasing efficiency of the modern industrial system decreased the earning potential of pecu niary capital, according to Veblen, by looking at the experience of a single hypothetical investor. When Capitalist A invests in a particular machine or process, he expects it to provide a certain rate of pecuniary return as long as it is industrially useful. This expected rate of return determines the capi tal value of his investment. If a more efficient method of production is discovered while Capitalist A is still using his original equipment, however, Capitalist B, who invests in up-to-date technology, can expect to make the same rate of profit at lower prices. Competition thus reduces prices so that the earning potential of Capitalist As investment decreases. Although no mechanical disaster has decreased the serviceability of Capitalist As indus trial equipment, his pecuniary capital has decreased below its nominal value. He no longer can earn the rate of profit that he expects, and he may not be able to pay off his loans, which are based on the original value of his investment. From the pecuniary perspective of Capitalist A, industrial progress has "destroyed" his capital. Although the industrial destruction of pecuniary capital had happened occasionally before the advent of machine industry, Veblen argued that the</page><page sequence="28">568 Wenzler rapid pace of technical progress since the 1870s made it a perpetual prob lem for businessmen. He argued that from the inherent character of the machine industry itself ... it follows that the earning capacity of any industrial enterprise enters on a decline from the outset, and that its capitalization, based on its initial putative earning-capacity, grows pro gressively antiquated from the start."67 Because industrial equipment constantly tended to lose its ability to gen erate pecuniary profits before it ceased to be useful as a means of produc ing material goods, progress created a perpetual discrepancy between the initial nominal value of capital investments and their current value. From the perspective of industry, of course, Veblen believed that there was no reason why this perpetual loss of pecuniary value should lead to industrial unemployment. As productive as the modern machine process had become, it could not produce more things than men could consume, especially in a capitalist society that wasted so much of its production on warfare and conspicuous consumption. This meant that there was no ma terial reason to abandon a functioning piece of industrial equipment when more efficient models were developed. People who use industrial appliances such as refrigerators or stoves at home, for example, do not immediately dispose of functioning machines when more efficient versions become avail able on the market. They may try to acquire the best machine that they can find when their current equipment breaks down, but there would be no reason to destroy a useful appliance simply because someone else has another appliance that was even more useful. Similarly, if economic pro duction were based on the material needs of industry alone, there would be no reason to abandon dated machinery unless the people using these machines could satisfy more urgent needs of the society by working else where. Because businessmen were interested in maximizing profits rather than maximizing production, however, the destruction of pecuniary capital seemed disastrous from their perspective. In order for a businessman to continue operating industrial equipment that was not state-of-the-art, he had to acknowledge that its earning potential had decreased. Businessmen were loath to do so for two reasons. In the first place, if the differential earning-potential of his equipment declined drastically, there was a good chance that a businessman no longer could meet the feed interest pay ments on his credit. This would lead to bankruptcy. In the second place, all businessmen, both the creditors, who gained material equipment during a depression, and debtors, who lost it, simply detested to admit that their pecuniary magnitude had decreased for all of the spiritual reasons men tioned above. For businessmen, therefore, the incessant pace of modem industrial progress created an unattractive market situation that they de</page><page sequence="29">The Metaphysics of Business 569 scribed as "over-production" or "cut-throat competition." These terms did not mean that the economy was producing too much or that businessmen had become more ruthless and competitive than normal. They simply meant that too many businesses were unable to earn "a fair rate of profit" when they had to compete against state-of-the-art equipment at the current level of prices. Eventually, if unrestrained industrial progress were allowed to continue, prices got so low that many businessmen no longer considered production worthwhile. By shutting down insolvent factories and laying off workers, however, they only aggravated their problem. Unemployment de creased the demand for vendible products and made it even more difficult for continuing businesses to earn a profit. Because these depressions caused by industrial progress were becom ing perpetual in a modem industrial economy, Veblen argued that "the full dominion of business enterprise is necessarily a transitory dominion." Even tually, the economic pressure of perpetual business depressions would eliminate one of the "two divergent cultural tendencies" that clashed with each other in a business society. The hybrid combination of natural rights and scientific progress, of business and industry, which had characterized nineteenth-century American culture, could not survive for very long in the twentieth century. Either the aristocratic ideals of business would produce a modem dynastic state, in which scientific and industrial progress would decline, or an industrial republic would finally liberate the instinct of work manship from the institution of ownership. If a dynastic state did follow the era of business enterprise, it would come through the efforts of businessmen to respond to depression. From the perspective of business, the two most effective responses to depression were monopoly and war. Monopoly power allowed businessmen to maintain the profitability of older investments by slowing the pace of innovation and restricting competition. The wave of corporate mergers that was occurring while Veblen wrote The Theory of Business Enterprise at the turn of the century was a largely successful attempt to achieve this kind of monopoly power. Veblen believed, however, that monopolies would have to become larger and larger in order to eliminate competition as the industrial econ omy became increasingly interdependent and as the amount of pecuniary capital seeking profitable investments accumulated. This meant that control over the production process would have to concentrate in the hands of fewer and fewer pecuniary magnates. War also helped to maintain the prof itability of modem business enterprise because it was the most effective means of wasting resources and increasing demand. Imperialism, which also was on the rise at the turn of the century, created business prosperity by maintaining domestic demand through military expenditures that destroyed the excessive production of machine industry. As a nation's leaders increas</page><page sequence="30">570 Wenzler ingly trained its people for war, however, Veblen believed that they would become more belligerent and superstitious and therefore less suitable for scientific and industrial occupations. As pecuniary power concentrated in the hands of a few monopolists and as the community increasingly focused on invidious warfare, the ambiguous moral code of natural rights would completely degenerate into the barbarian moral code of honor and prowess. Even the illusionary and half-hearted respect for science and industry char acteristic of the nineteenth century would disappear in a repressive modern state geared for war. If, in contrast, an industrial or socialist republic were to replace the system of business enterprise, it would come because workers simply had lost their faith in pecuniary values. From Veblen's perspective, the power of modern businessmen resembled the power of priests more than it re sembled the power of warriors. In the end, the business class depended on the myth of ownership and the metaphysics of natural rights more than it depended on direct physical coercion. Because the privileges of ownership were extraneous to the physical process of production, businessmen would soon become impotent if industrial workers, as a group, stopped believing in their mythologies. At some point during a depression, industrial workers could decide that it was ridiculous to sacrifice the material efficiency and well being of the community in order to maintain the pecuniary magnitude of the captains of finance. Once the spell of ownership was broken, they could operate the machinery of modern industry for their own purposes rather for the spiritual satisfaction of the owning class. In The Engineers and the Price System, Veblen speculated in some detail how such a transition might take place, but the essential factor was always the "spiritual attitude" of industrial workers. Ultimately, the fate of the twentieth century de pended on whether common men believed in the moral values promulgated by businessmen and imperialists or in the vulgar facts that they confronted everyday at work. DEMENTIA PRAECOX Much to Veblen s dismay, Americans seemed to be choosing myth over fact during the final decade of his life. After allowing himself to hope that World War I and the Russian Revolution might make the world safe for socialism, a disappointed Veblen sensed that American society had become "something of a psychiatric clinic" in the 1920s. In an era of "business as usual," the American legion, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Lusk Commission, American culture seemed to be "breaking down into the systematized il lusions of dementia praecox." Veblen complained that "the logical faculty</page><page sequence="31">The Metaphysics of Business 571 appears to have suffered a notable degree of prostration throughout the American community; and all the while it is the more puerile crudities of superstitious fear that have been making particular and inordinate gains."68 As Veblen looked forward into the twentieth century at the end of his life, the fear of a neo-feudalistic state legitimized by a culture of fantasy and deception loomed large in his imagination. In many ways, of course, the "American Century" has borne out Ve blen's worst fears. No century has been more prolific in its waste of human life. None has been more extravagant in its waste of industrial resources to the point where we may destroy the material foundations of human ex istence in our search for immaterial profits. Public culture in the twentieth century has become obsessed with the magical logic of advertising and in vidious displays of prowess in sports, warfare, and business. The privileges of property have further contaminated the rhetoric of democracy as the rights of ownership have concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer men. Our public culture in this century might well be described-as a kind of dementia in which the words and images we employ to describe our society have become alienated from the material facts that shape our ex perience. In other ways, however, Veblen's fears appear to have been exagger ated. Scientific progress and industrial development have not been stifled, as Veblen feared that they would be in a neobarbarian state. At the same time that the twentieth century has become the most wasteful century in human history, it also has become the most productive and efficient. Sci entists have continued to make new discoveries in physics, chemistry, biol ogy, and medicine while the industrial system has become an ever more efficient and interdependent means of producing useful goods. It seems that the metaphysics of business enterprise have continued to flourish in the midst of the machine process that Veblen believed would either destroy or be destroyed by business. At the end of the twentieth century, American culture has not made that final choice between the illusions of business and the facts of industry that Veblen considered immanent the beginning of the century. The continuing coexistence of these "two divergent cultural tendencies" indicates that they may be more compatible than Veblen be lieved. Although business and industry are not identical, as the classical economists assumed, they are not always the hostile enemies that Veblen portrayed them to be either. In the experience both of the businessman and the worker, business and industry often have reinforced each other in ways that Veblen failed to anticipate. In his analysis of business enterprise, for example, Veblen perceptively observed that the desire to maximize profits was not synonymous with the technical requirements of maximizing production. As we have demon</page><page sequence="32">572 Wenzler strated, this distinction allowed Veblen to show how industrial progress could lead to business depressions for rational business reasons that con ventional economists could not explain. Yet, Veblen underestimated the ex tent to which the profit motive would continue to spur technological innovation in the twentieth century. Businessmen still can acquire an in vidious differential advantage over their competitors by increasing the ef ficiency of production process that is under their control or by acquiring the rights to technological innovations. Although technological advances destroy the pecuniary capital of some businessmen, they often produce vast fortunes for others. Veblen's desire to purify the process of production by isolating it completely from the profit motive led him to ignore this complex interrelationship between profits and production. This prevented him from anticipating that the continuing dominance of the business class could cor respond to increasing industrial efficiency as it has?through the twentieth century at least. In his analysis of the modern worker, also, Veblen failed to see that the machine process could reinforce rather than undermine pecuniary val ues. Although Veblen believed that modern industry inculcated scientific habits of mind, one could argue that it makes the modern proletarian even less likely to think in materialistic terms than the handicraft worker did. Often a modern factory worker needs to know much less about the indus trial process of production than did the handicraft worker. A shoemaker who makes shoes from scratch needs to know more about leather, knives, and nails, than an industrial worker who performs a simple and repetitive act without knowing how it fits into the larger process of production. In contrast to Veblen's arguments, therefore, the work experience of a modern laborer often leaves him freer to develop magical ideas about material pro duction than did the work experience of a handicraft worker. In fact, the routine nature of factory labor often makes the modern proletarian even more likely to think of his labor in strictly pecuniary terms. Because work has become so pointless and alienating for so many workers, they have less interest in the impersonal ends that their labor seeks to accomplish than in the pecuniary wages that they receive from their employers. This suggests that the modern machine process, which Veblen saw as an antidote to the preconceptions of business enterprise, often reinforces these preconcep tions. Veblen failed to recognize that capitalism often makes labor irksome not only by making it a sign of social inferiority but also by transforming the physical process of labor into a degrading routine. Veblen considered the "discipline of the machine" benign because it was imposed on the worker by the impersonal laws of nature rather than by other human agents. In the work experience of the modern proletarian, however, the</page><page sequence="33">The Metaphysics of Business 573 objective discipline imposed on him by industrial facts often becomes in distinguishable from the personal discipline imposed on him by business managers and "efficiency experts." By controlling the machinery of pro duction, capitalists not only determine if and when the worker will be al lowed to work, as Veblen argued, but they also determine the nature and the process of labor. The businessman can control pace of a worker's labor by controlling the speed of his machines, and he can determine the skills? or lack of skills?that the worker will need to develop by his choice of industrial processes. When analyzing the process of distribution in a capi talist society, Veblen perceptively recognized that the system of private property allowed businessmen to employ inanimate objects as a means of controlling other human agents. By offering the "impersonal" process of production as the alternative to the "personal" process of distribution, how ever, Veblen failed to see that the capitalist's ambiguous power existed within the realm of production as well as in the realm of distribution. Thus, the industrial process by itself has not provided workers with an escape from the perverse values of business. By suggesting that impersonal science and industry are not complete as alternatives to business enterprise, these arguments bring us back to the questions of waste and morality with which we started. At the beginning of the essay, I suggested that, by employing the concept of "conspicuous waste" in his theory, Veblen was making an implicit moral judgment about the teleological ends that society ought to achieve. One cannot describe an action as wasteful or efficient unless one knows what an actor ought to accomplish. From the amoral perspective of Darwinian science, which stud ies the blind accumulation of impersonal causes and effects, "waste" has no meaning. Because the scientist assumes that nature has no purpose, he cannot describe natural events as wasteful or efficient. From the perspective of industry, also, the concept of social waste makes sense only if one knows the teleological ends that society ought to seek. The engineer can deter mine whether a process is efficient only if he knows the purpose of that process. By calling business and leisure wasteful, therefore, Veblen was making a moral judgment about the social values that were most beneficial to human well being. According to Veblen, business enterprise, in its quest for pecuniary value, undermined all of the other possible ends that society might seek to accomplish, such as the quest for universal human welfare, scientific truth, or artistic beauty. In a business society, all of the excess production of human industry was employed in the businessman's battle for invidious prestige and honor rather than for these generic human ends. By arguing that the competitive values of business were not inherent in human nature, Veblen exposed the contradictions in the conventional economists' effort to employ their supposedly "value neutral" science as a</page><page sequence="34">574 Wenzler means of justifying business enterprise. Nevertheless, by calling business values "wasteful" Veblen himself also was making a moral judgment about business rather than offering a scientific analysis of it. In his effort to prove that he used the term "conspicuous waste" as a scientific concept rather than a moral judgment, Veblen argued that a shared idea of waste was inherent in a society's perception of the world: There is a good deal of a consensus as to what manner of things are wasteful. The brute fact that the word is current shows that. Without something of a consensus on that head, the word would not be intelligible; that is to say, we should have no such word .... It is because men's notions of the generically human, of what is the legitimate end of life, does not differ incalculably from man to man that men are able to live in communities and to hold common interests.69 Thus, Veblen suggested that, by describing business enterprise as wasteful, the social scientist was not making a private moral judgment of his own but was reporting the moral consensus of the human community. This ar gument is somewhat incoherent. Obviously, the "brute fact" that people use the word "waste" does not mean that they agree about what is wasteful. Human beings have used words such as "truth," "beauty," "justice," and "virtue" for centuries without ever reaching a consensus about what is true, beautiful, just, or virtuous. By suggesting that a generic concept of waste was embedded in man's social consciousness, therefore, Veblen seemed to mirror the mistake of conventional economists whose hedonistic calculus suggested that the values of business enterprise were embedded in the in dividual mind. In both cases, the suggestion that the "legitimate ends of life" can be discovered through an impersonal scientific analysis of facts ignores the political and literary dialogue whereby human communities at tempt to forge a moral consensus. Veblen seemed to believe that, once the illusions of ownership were dispelled, workers would have little problem deciding what to do with their labor. This idea does not seem to be tenable in the era of modern industry and mass production. In the era of savagery, when a community could do little more than provide for its material subsistence, men may have had a rough consensus about the "legitimate" ends of industry. Today, however, when we can produce much more than we require for our basic physical subsistence, such a consensus has become more difficult to achieve. In or der to develop a compelling alternative to the values of business enterprise, industrial workers need more than an impersonal analysis of the competi tive aims of businessmen. They also need a powerful alternative vision of "the legitimate ends of human life." Veblen's scientific analysis may clear the ground on which these alternative values can be constructed by de stroying the notion that business values are inevitable and natural. Yet, be</page><page sequence="35">The Metaphysics of Business 575 cause science and industry focus on means rather than ends, they are not capable of revealing the "legitimate ends of human life" all by themselves. ENDNOTES 1. Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York, 1899), pp. 98-99. 2. Casual readers and critics of Veblen are not the only people who dismiss his claims of moral neutrality. See, for example, Rick Tilman, the most prolific student/admirer of Veblen writing today. In a recent essay on Veblen, Tilman argued that: "Veblen's theory of institutional change had a potent normative component. . . . Conventional economics has been heavily influenced by the radical ethical relativism and moral agnosticism inherent in neoclassical economics. The Veblenian position thus provides a clear alternative, with its normladen focus on the desirability of particular values." See "Some Recent Interpretations of Thorstein Veblen's Theory of Institutional Change," in Thorstein Veblen: Critical Assessments II, John Cunningham Wood ed., (New York, 1993), pp. 455-56. I think that there is some truth in the idea that Veblen's theory had a "normative component" but Veblen never would have described his theory in this way. He constantly attacked the tendency of other economists to "normalize" their theories, and he would have been horrified by the idea that his own theory was "normladen." I also want to argue in the course of this essay that he did not see conventional neoclassical economists as "moral relativists" or "moral agnostics." What bothered Veblen about neoclassical economics were the pervasive moral assumptions that undermined its claims of objectivity. 3. See Joseph Dorfman in Thorstein Veblen and His America, (New York: 1934). Veblen considered "The Place of Science in Modem Civilization''' his best essay. See Dorfman, p. 260. The essay became the title work of the most important collection of Veblen's essays. Dorfman also discussed how Veblen's emphasis on moral neutrality confused his classes as well as his readers: "Of Veblen's own opinions on prevailing questions no one was certain .... A student in the course in trusts would ask what could be done about the situation he described. Veblen's eyes would sparkle, the lines of his face would be drawn into a quizzical smile, and he would answer, in effect: "Mr.-is not satisfied with the philosopher's statement, 'I want to know.' Mr.-wants to do something about it.' The class would laugh and Veblen would say no more, but often he would tell his students: 'We are interested in what is, not what ought to be.'" pp. 246-247. 4. See Thorstein Veblen, "Mr. Cummings's Strictures on The Theory of the Leisure Class" in Essays in Our Changing Order, Leon Ardzrooni ed., (New York: 1934), pp. 16-31. Especially see pp. 18-19 where Veblen defended his definition of "waste." 5. On this confusion about Veblen's meaning, also see Tilman. In The Intellectual Legacy of Thorstein Veblen: Unresolved Issues, (Greenwood Press: Westport, Connecticut, 1996), Tilman notes that "there is no consensus among Veblen scholars left, right or center, be they social scientists, humanists or otherwise, regarding the central meaning of his work." p. Xi. 6. John Bates Clark, The Distribution of Wealth, (New York: 1899), p. v. Clark taught Veblen at Carleton College in Minnesota during the 1880s. Clark was a founding member of the American Economic Association. Today the most prestigious award that an American economist can win is the John Bates Clark Award. 7. In my dissertation, "Transcendental Economics: The Quest to Harmonize Economic and Moral Law in Nineteenth-Century American Thought," I study this tradition of American economic thought in detail by looking at the work of Henry C. Carey, Henry George, and John Bates Clark. I argue that Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was a friend of Carey's, helped to legitimize this way of thinking about the economy with his transcendental philosophy of mind. Emerson argued that the moral laws of the human mind were embedded in the scientific laws of nature. See, for example, Emerson's "Compensation,"</page><page sequence="36">576 Wenzler in which he says "Thus is the universe alive. All things are moral." The Selected Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Brooks Atkinson ed., (New York: 1940), p. 175. Veblen's philosophy of nature was essentially the opposite of Emerson's. Veblen might say, "The universe is not alive. No thing is moral." 8. Notice the similarity between the categorical distinctions in Veblen's thought, and the epistemological categories of Immanuel Kant. According to Kant, the human mind, in the noumenal realm, was "spiritual," and "teleological" whereas the phenomenal realm of natural science was materialistic and pre-determined. Veblen wrote his doctoral dissertation on Kant, and I think that Kant's philosophy continued to influence Veblen in more profound ways than most scholars have recognized. One could even argue that Veblen's attack against capitalism was based on his belief that it violated Kant's categorical imperative by treating human beings as means?or as phenomenological objects?rather than as ends. Although Veblen's dissertation has been lost, he published an interesting essay on "Kant's Critique of Judgment" in 1884. This can be found in Essays in Our Changing Order, 175-193. 9.

It would take us away from the main argument of the essay to explore the interesting relationship between Marx and Veblen. Veblen considered Marx a Romantic, like the classical economists, because he believed that Marx assumed that some sort of non-human spiritual force was directing history to a specific human end, a socialist society. On a more subtle level, Veblen also believed that Marx's discussion of class interests was teleological. To talk about the interests?as opposed to the tendencies?of a class is to impute teleological consistency to it according to Veblen. Whereas Smith had seen a single spiritual agent governing the capitalist economy toward a harmonious end, Veblen thought that Marx saw two spiritual agents fighting out an inevitable battle.

Although this claim may surprise some readers today, it was a widely shared opinion amongst economists in Veblen's era. In some works of American history, the "Gilded Age," which preceded the reforms of the Progressive Era, has been described as an era of great prosperity for business. This was not how most of the businessmen who actually lived through the Gilded Age experienced it. Simply by noting the existence of a long depression, Veblen was not being iconoclastic. I discuss this issue in some detail in the fifth chapter of my dissertation, "The Crisis of Transcendental Economics." Also see, James Livingston, Origins of the Federal Reserves System: Money, Class, and Corporate Capitalism, 1890-1913, (Cornell: 1986). The first chapter discusses this issue. The most influential contemporary account of the depression was David A. Wells, Recent Economic Changes, (New York: 1889). 66. Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of Business Enterprise, p. 234. 67.
