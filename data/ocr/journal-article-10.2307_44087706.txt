<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas Pughe The Politics of Form in J.M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals J.M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals (1999), frequently read as his thinly veiled plea in favor of animal rights, is a textual hybrid, part fiction, part academic lecture.1 He actually gave the two parts of his text as the 1998 Tanner lectures at Princeton University, thereby imi- tating his fictional alter-ego, Elizabeth Costello, a celebrated Australian writer invited to speak at an American university. Reviewers paid little attention to what they took to be Coetzee's post- modernist posturing; why could he not come out more directly with his opinions? The Lives of Animals also contains responses by four dis- tinguished academics from different disciplines (anthropology, litera- ture, philosophy, primatology), including one by animal rights theorist Peter Singer. This thereby intensifies the jeu de miroirs between fictional and actual lectures and between fiction and theory.2 The Princeton respondents indeed echo Elizabeth Costello's fictional audience (to whom the main part of the text's narrative frame is devoted), for her radical animal rights stance gives rise, within the fiction, to sometimes heated debate. "Do you really believe . . . that poetry classes are going to close down the slaughterhouses?" (LA 103), her son, who is among the audience, asks her at one point. Such inbuilt resistance to the text's political message implies a critical reception on the readers' part, over and above the sympathy they may have for Costello's cause. This duality is his ironical "lesson." As Marjorie Garber, one of Coetzee's Princeton respondents, puts it: "In these two elegant lectures we thought John Coetzee was talking about animals. Could it be, however, that all along he was really Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 18.2 (Spring 2011) Advance Access publication May 21, 2011 doi:10.1093/isle/isr031 © The Author(s) 2011.

Put differently: while his fictional alter-ego is talking about animals or, rather, ani- mality, Coetzee is really questioning representation; not only does the text, on a thematic level, incite the readers to resist cruelty to animals, but, on a formal level, it invites them to resist- or, at least, to recon- sider-the terms in which this call to resistance is clad. Could it be, then, that the metafictional form of Lives , as much as its concern with animal rights, accounts for its critical thrust? Derek Attridge rightly warns that readers who take these lecture-fictions only as arguments fail to respond "to the full ethical force of the fictions themselves" (19 7).3 In what follows, I want to argue that it is in fact the reflexive quality of Coetzee's writing, and the double resistance it provokes, that constitutes, in Jonathan Bate's term, its "ecological work" (Bate 200). A brief word on this term: Bate uses it to help define what he calls an "ecopoem"; such a poem tries to think "the question of the making of the oikos" (Bate 200). As an example Bate cites Elizabeth Bishop's "The Moose," a poem that, according to him, shows that the "ecological work" of language does not simply consist in a didactic attitude. Of course, the ecopoem- or, by extension, other genres of eco-text- may concern any other aspect of "the relationship of the human and the non-human environment, throughout human cultural history."4 Animals do, however, play a special role in this relation- ship. As the editors of the Literature and the Environment reader put it in their introduction to a chapter devoted to "The Human Animal": "some still-wild part of us searches for a way to reconnect with the natural world. Our longing inevitably returns us to our ancient ties with other animals" (Anderson et al. xxiii). Hence the importance for the ecocritic of studying the representation of animals and the attrac- tiveness of Bate's notion of "ecological work." Yet Bate does not define precisely what such textual work may consist in; he seems to suggest that it is finally a question of mimesis, of "getting close" to nature, as his formula "truth to nature as a criterion of aesthetic judgement" implies (34). Jonathan Skinner, editor of the poetry mag- azine ecopoetics , has in fact proposed an approach to the "ecological work" of literary writing that corresponds more closely to Coetzee's aesthetics in Lives : "Imagining endangered species is a useful act of language; writing that de-centers the habitual configurations, enough to see who's endangered, may be more useful." It is indeed Coetzee's de-centering of "habitual configurations" that will interest me here; such configurations include even the argument in favor of animal rights. Insofar my approach, though sympathetic to animal rights, is in fact more closely associated with ecopoetics, with the question of</page><page sequence="3">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 379 how to represent nature in an eco-centric or bio-centric way. It is thus primarily concerned, to use Cary Wolfe's pun, with animal rites, or, more precisely, with the interconnection between rite and writ(ing). The aim of this essay in discussing Lives , then, is to provide a concrete example of the way aesthetic discourse can be said to do "ecological work."5 In the first part of Lives , entitled "The Philosophers and the Animals," Costello denounces animal exploitation in research and food production, systematic cruelty that is, she says, sanctioned by the canonical figures of Western philosophy. In contradistinction to the hegemonic "speciesist" discourse, Franz Kafka's story, "A Report to an Academy," is said to offer an imaginative engagement with an animal's way of experiencing, an argument Costello reinforces in the second part ("The Poets and the Animals") when she conducts a seminar on the image of animals in poems by Rainer Maria Rilke ("The Panther") and by Ted Hughes ("The Jaguar") while also responding to criticism of her views by one of the host university's philosophy teachers. In both the lecture and the seminar, she ascribes to the artistic imagination the capacity- absent, according to her, from scientific and philosophical discourses- to empathize with animals. Costello's denunciation of human cruelty to animals takes the form of a radical critique of what Wolfe (2003) has called "the dis- course of species" dominating Western intellectual history. In "The Philosophers and the Animals," she therefore takes to task the canon- ical figures in the history of philosophy, accusing them of having failed to respond adequately to "the challenge of animality," l'épreuve de l'animalité, as Elisabeth De Fontenay puts it in the subtitle to Le silence des bêtes (1998), her monumental study of human- animal rela- tions in European philosophy. The slaughterhouses and animal labo- ratories, says Costello, symbolize the bankruptcy of a whole system of thought, based on reason, on the logos. In part 2 of Lives , she even goes to the theatrical extreme of halting the debate that is raised against her, dismissing a philosophy professor of the host university because his language appears to her to be imprisoned in what Adorno and Horkheimer call "the dialectic of enlightenment"- in a way of thinking that claims to uphold reasoned argument but that in fact harbors its dialectical opposite, namely, the rejection of differ- ence; reason itself becomes a myth of human superiority. Hence Costello argues: I am not sure I want to concede that I share reason with my opponent. Not when reason is what underpins the</page><page sequence="4">380 ISLE whole long philosophical tradition to which he belongs. ... If the last common ground that I have with him is reason, and if reason is what sets me apart from the veal calf, then thank you but no thank you, I'll talk to someone else. (LA 67) I am sympathetic to Costello's situation, and I admire her courage; however, I think her refusal to enter debate and to "share reason" must make us skeptical, if we are to follow the model of the fictional audience Coetzee has built into his text. Whom will Costello talk to if not to reasonable and critical people? This is precisely the problem Lives struggles with: its metacritical approach is an attempt to argue against the hegemonic "discourse of species" within a framework of reasoned exchange.6 Many of the points Costello makes polemically are more profoundly and subtly developed in the literature address- ing the issue of animal rights and, beyond it, the horizon of posthu- manism. Her radical attitude is at least partially shared by- to name some of the references cited in this essay- Derrida, De Fontenay, Wolfe, and several of the contributors to Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer's Great Ape Project . Coetzee's footnotes in Lives clearly show his familiarity with the relevant literature. This, then, is the critical background which Costello mounts a defense of poetry, arguing, romantically, that only the artistic imagination is capable of freeing itself of the "speciesism" according to which nonhuman animals are used as foils to define the specificity and superiority of humans (and also of certain humans over others, as, for example, the etymological connection between the words chattel, cattle, and capital would seem to suggest).7 But to the poet, as Keats writes, "the tiger's yell / Comes articulate and presseth / On his ear like mother tongue" ("Where's the Poet? Show him! show him" [280]). Costello claims, with respect to Thomas Nagel's famous essay contesting that humans can ever know what it feels like to be an animal, "Despite Thomas Nagel . . . despite Thomas Aquinas and René Descartes . . . there is no limit to the extent to which we can think ourselves into the being of another. There are no bounds to the sympathetic imagination" (LA 35)- as if imaginatively we could transcend the human-animal boundary, we could transcend language.8 Costello's romantic "fusionism" or primi- tivism is of course shared by a host of twentieth-century writers, several of which she approvingly mentions herself- D.H. Lawrence, Robinson Jeffers, Gary Snyder, Ted Hughes- and who frequently appear in environmentalist anthologies such as Anderson et al.'s Literature and the Environment.9 In the seminar on Rilke and Hughes that Costello teaches in part 2 of Lives ("The Poets and the Animals"),</page><page sequence="5">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 381 she tries to show the "sympathetic imagination" at work in two poems. Rilke's "The Panther" and Hughes's "The Jaguar" reflect a modern city dweller's relation to nature of which the zoo is a major symbol. The big cats, moreover, incarnate primitivist yearning. These elements, over and above the poems' celebrity, explain Costello's choice. One might therefore expect her to read the texts as sympa- thetic renderings of wild animals' suffering in captivity. But Costello's main concern is to reject the traditional practice, in fable or allegory, of pressing animals into symbolic usage. Poetry must be "true" to animal life. On the strength of this criterion she declares Hughes's "Jaguar," written in response to Rilke's "Panther," the superior of the two poems. In Rilke's poem, she argues, "the panther is there as a stand-in for something else. He dissolves into a dance of energy around a centre, an image that comes from physics, elementary par- ticle physics" (LA 50). According to her, Rilke's poem attempts "to find an idea in the animal" and is not "about the animal" (LA 51). Hughes, by contrast and, "leaving aside the ethics of caging large animals- is feeling his way towards a different kind of being-in-the world" (LA 51). He has tried to body forth the jaguar, to show what it may mean to inhabit the jaguar's body, to move as a jaguar. Indeed, what Hughes admires about the jaguar is that despite its caged state, the great cat seems to have retained an element of ungov- ernable wildness, which allows it to abstract itself from the zoo surroundings: He spins from the bars, but there's no cage to him More than to the visionary his cell: His stride is wilderness of freedom: The world rolls under the long thrust of his heel. Over the cage floor the horizons come. (Hughes 15) These lines clearly evoke and reject Rilke's well-known ones about the bars of the panther's cage. It is doubtful, though, that Hughes's comparison between the jaguar and the visionary, both ignoring the limits of their respective confinement, can be thought of as any less anthropomorphic than Rilke's comparison between the panther's incessant circling of his cage and the atoms circling around the nucleus. Costello is in fact quite insensitive to the effects of Rilke's poetry, which, it is true, get lost in translation: His vision, from the constantly passing bars, Has grown so weary that it cannot hold</page><page sequence="6">382 isle Anything else. It seems to him there are A thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.10 His rhymes, regular iambic meter, and repetitive diction, in the origi- nal, seem to suggest an incessant passage of bars before the panther's eye, blunting its vision, making the world disappear in a blur of bars. Of course, this wearied cat harbors none of the irreducible wildness that Hughes would like to sense in the jaguar and that is no doubt what attracts Costello to the younger poet's feline. She prefers Hughes because his celebration of the cat's indomitable wildness reflects the intensity of her political convictions. Thus Costello's reading actually reinforces the anthropomorphic quality of Hughes's poem. One might, in opposition to her, feel that Rilke has found formal solutions that are more apt to evoke the animal's sensations, for example, when the motif of the bars is echoed by the poems iambs and rigid stanzaic structure. The older poet therefore seems to come closer to Costello's claim in favor of the poetic imagination, namely that it manages to "return the living, electric being to lan- guage," even though in this case the being in question is the "despair" of the panther rather than the "pride" of the jaguar (LA 65). The conclusion to this line of argument is to accept that both poems are equally anthropomorphic; the difference between them is a question of how we judge the effect of their respective anthropo- morphism. Inevitably, the poem must remind us of the nature/ culture divide, even as it explores that divide. The problem of Costello's claims, directed against anthropomorphism and pathetic fallacy, is succinctly summarized by Lawrence Buell: "to ban pathetic fallacy- were such a thing possible- would be worse than to permit its unavoidable excesses. For without it, environmental care might not find its voice" (218). As a response to the ambiguous qualities of anthropomorphism, Buell perceives in certain poets a kind of "episte- mologica! stuttering" (182), which might also be a way of describing Coetzee's metafictional strategies. At any rate, Costello's audience remains skeptical of her demon- stration; her son, for example, wonders: "Isn't that what is so suspect about the whole animal-rights business: that it has to ride on the back of pensive gorillas and sexy jaguars and huggable pandas because the real objects of concern, chickens and pigs, to say nothing of white rats or prawns, are not newsworthy?" (LA 55). Costello's reading, for all its considerable power of persuasion, remains a fiction, which ironically reminds us that the union between human and animal in the domain of the poetic imagination is a question of representation.11 This irony is reinforced when Costello tries to</page><page sequence="7">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 383 read- or, perhaps, misread- Kafka's story "A Report to an Academy" as an illustration of her faith in literature. In "A Report to an Academy" (first published in 1917 in a journal entitled Der Jude), a trained. ape, who has acquired speech, reports before an academic audience on his transformation from ape to human.12 The story is partly inspired by the German romantic poet Wilhelm Hauff 's novella, "The Ape as Human Being" ("Der Affe als Mensch," 1826), in which a trained orangutan's aping of human behavior serves as a distorting mirror of some of the "superior" species' manners. Kafka no doubt also knew other literary examples in which apes serve to mirror human apes, such as Thomas Love Peacock's Melincourt (1817).13 This satirical tradition has left its traces on Kafka's shaping of the ritual of initiation his Red Peter has to undergo in the course of his journey toward humanity; among other trials proving his aptness, he has to be able to down a bottle of schnapps and, of course, speak, like Costello, before a learned assem- bly. But it is not this link with satire that draws Costello to Kafka's "Report." Rather, she is struck by the parallelism between the story and the psychologist Wolfgang Köhler's classic monograph, The Mentality of Apes- published like Kafka's text in 1917- in which the results of a series of behaviorist experiments testing the "intelligence" of apes were made public for the first time. Kafka's text is thus inter- preted as a meditation on the cost to the wild animal of this course in humanization (though compared with contemporary laboratory testing, Köhler's experiments seem relatively benign): According to his own account, Red Peter was captured on the African mainland by hunters specializing in the ape trade .... So were the apes Köhler worked with. Both Red Peter and Köhler's apes then underwent a period of training intended to humanize them. Red Peter passed his course with flying colours, though at deep personal cost. Kafka's story deals with that cost. (LA 27) In Costello's interpretation, Kafka's art opposes to Köhler's behavior- ism the power of the sympathetic or poetic imagination.14 Moving and insightful as this comparison between Kafka and Köhler cer- tainly is- for reasons of space, I will not deal with it in detail- it allows only a rather partial reading of "A Report to an Academy." Kafka uses his lecturing ape in a Swiftian manner to ridicule the "rational animal," a point of departure that develops in the course of the story into a meditation on knowing and representing animals. There is no trace of primitivism in Kafka's writing, though his</page><page sequence="8">384 isle sympathy with the ape is pervasive. Red Peter begins his report by warning his audience that he cannot say what he was like when he was an ape, having crossed the dividing line from ape to man. Describing his former life, he says, means distorting it: "Of course what I felt then as an ape I can represent now only in human terms, and therefore I misrepresent it, but although I cannot reach back to the truth of the old ape life, there is no doubt that it lies somewhere in the direction I have indicated" (176). Though the speaker on the other side of the divide can no longer describe the "truth of the old ape life" (Affenwahrheit in the German original),15 his narrative never- theless points in the direction in which that truth lies. Red Peter's truth is epitomized by the word "way out" (Ausweg), which first occurs when he tries to describe his feelings upon being captured and caged for transport to Europe: "But over and above it all only the one feeling: no way out" (178). Red Peter's intensive education- he prides himself on having achieved the degree of intelligence of an average European- was indeed his only way of escaping human bru- tality toward animals, especially being locked up in a zoo: "To get out somewhere, to get out! Only not to stay motionless with raised arms, crushed against a wooden wall" (178). Red Peter, the human in the ape body is all ape, for the trappings of humanity he has acquired, speech in particular, are but parts of his strategy to preserve his animality, they are his way out. One might add here that if Costello had taken into account the particular quality of Kafka's writing, her comparison between fictional and scientific accounts of training apes- especially training them to sign- could have proved more fruitful.16 Beyond the satirical aim of presenting the "humani- mal" as an escapee from bestial humans, Kafka's "Report to an Academy," already by the genre of speech it imitates, de-metaphorizes the verb to ape. Red Peter concludes his report with the following ironic words: "I am only making a report. To you also, honoured Members of the Academy, I have only made a report" (184). Yet he has re-ported (i.e. "brought back") nothing. Instead, he has aped human speech, a trick or art he has acquired from dire necessity and which disguises and preserves his animality. In this sense, Red Peter really does ape human language; that is, he inspires it with his "ape truth." His report at once reveals and conceals the ape. The term Ausweg may thus also be taken self-reflectively to refer to a strategy of writing that tries to be true to the animal's experience by using language that continually questions itself, figuring the truth by its failure, just as Red Peter can only imply the "ape truth" by dis- guising his true being in human speech. Thus, as Graham Huggan has suggested, "A Report to an Academy" is a kind of "counterbeast</page><page sequence="9">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 385 fable" which "diverts the anthropocentric axioms of beast fable away from their usual targets- the frailties of humanity- using them instead to test the very limits of the human: the capacity for reasoned thought" (710). In sum, Kafka reveals himself to be much more aware of the limits and the ambiguities of mimesis than Elizabeth Costello seems to realize. She informs her audience that in her role as a lecturer she identifies with Red Peter, a remark that could be taken as a kind of metaphor for the "sympathetic imagination" (LA 18). And yet, ironi- cally, Red Peter himself questions the capacity of language to render the truth of the animal. Such is Coetzee's irony at his heroine's expense. Like Kafka, Coetzee makes fiction by parodying academic discourse and like Kafka's fictional lecture, Coetzee's doubles back on its own language, provoking the reader's "yes, but . . ." reaction. This is made strikingly clear at the point in the first part of Lives when the fictional audience's skepticism erupts into open protest. In the course of her comments on "A Report to an Academy," Costello speculates that Kafka may have implied an analogy between racial discrimination and the "speciesism" of which Red Peter is a victim: "If Red Peter took it upon himself to make the arduous descent from the silence of the beasts to the gabble of reason in the spirit of the scapegoat, the chosen one, then his amanuensis was a scapegoat from birth, with a presentiment, a Vorgefühl for the massa- cre of the chosen people that was to take place soon after his death" (LA 26). Kafka's "presentiment" seems to express itself, as we have seen, in his parody of reasoned discourse and of what Derrida calls le pouvoir-avoir of the logos, that is, the power of human exceptionality that comes with language (Derrida 278).17 In the ape's position as a lecturer, Costello is a great deal less subtle than Kaflca. Her talk comes to a disturbing crisis when she draws an analogy between modern slaughterhouses and the Nazi death camps. Denunciation of the camps, she says, "reverberates . . . with the language of the stock- yards and slaughterhouses .... The crime of the Third Reich, says the voice of accusation, was to treat people like animals" (LA 20). On the strength of this remark about the use of animal imagery to describe the Shoah, she proceeds to a much more controversial analogy: Let me say it openly: we are surrounded by an enter- prise of degradation, cruelty and killing which rivals anything that the Third Reich was capable of, indeed dwarfs it, in that ours is an enterprise without end, self- regenerating, bringing rabbits, rats, poultry, livestock</page><page sequence="10">386 isle ceaselessly into the world for the purpose of killing them. (LA 21) Costello's fictional audience is understandably ill at ease, and one member of the faculty, a distinguished poet called Abraham Stern, accuses her of levity and blasphemy: "You misunderstand the nature of likeness; I would even say you misunderstand willfully, to the point of blasphemy" (LA 49-50). You misunderstand the nature of like- ness. With this criticism Stern counters Costello's claims in favor of boundless sympathy with animals of which her analogy is meant as a kind of example. We cannot speak about animals without using analogies- even if the idea of a union in suffering seems to deny this- and thereby we reveal the historical, cultural, and moral condi- tions under which these analogies were produced. The whole problem, made painfully obvious by the reference to the Shoah, is how to use them. Here, then, Costello's romantic primitivism is shown to be politically and ethically ambiguous. Kate Soper suc- cinctly sums up the origin of this ambiguity: "[TJhose who deplore the 'anthropocentricity' of human attitudes to nature must accept that the very coherence of their complaint relies on the acknowledgement of human exceptionality" (420). Primitivism, in other words, is a liter- ary form of exceptionality. Costello is certainly not alone in observing that the logic of "spe- ciesism" allows the "othering" of all forms of life, animal or human, thereby, for example, condoning slavery and racism. In his response to the Princeton version of the text, Peter Singer, for example, alludes to Isaac Bashevis Singer's comments on this question in order to underline that "a comparison is not necessarily an equation . . . [Singer] is not saying that the crimes are equally evil, but that both are based on the principle that might is right, and the strong can do what they please with those who are in their power" (LA 86). Elisabeth de Fontenay, too, follows this implacable logic to the extreme of crimes against humanity. Her research, she says, has been guided by three interwoven themes: A particular affection for animals, that goes without saying. But also, even if this may seem paradoxical or be taken by some as a hurtful analogy, the memory of the destruction of several million men, women and chil- dren. And over and above all this, a true incapacity to define a human quality of any kind that is unique and specific. (13)18</page><page sequence="11">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 387 Love and respect for animals, the memory of the Shoah and an anti- humanist stance are elegantly and movingly connected here. The con- nection between these three themes motivates De Fontenay's painstaking analysis of "speciecism" in the philosophical canon, an analysis no less radical than Costello's without, however, arriving at the conclusion that the "discourse of species" can be criticized and destabilized in any other form than from within. De Fontenay insists on the necessity of contextualizing and criticizing specific animal metaphors, on keeping the metaphors alive, as she says ("the need to transform the fixed expression Tike cattle to the slaughterhouse' into a living metaphor"), at the same time as she emphasizes the link between race and species (13). Clearly, the "life of the metaphor," the precise "nature of likeness," escapes Costello's control, dislocating her argument, well intentioned as it may be, and conjuring up the specter of her racism. Her fervent defense of animal rights becomes embroiled in biopolitics. The effect of this passage in her lecture, then, is not to prove Costello wrong, but, instead, to make her dis- course turn back on itself and question its pathos, its claim to empathy. It becomes, in Huggan's words, "a fable of the impossible attempt to escape anthropocentrism" (713). This is the problem Derrida alludes to when he puns on animaux and animots, and also on suivre and être in the title of his essay ("L'animal que donc je suis").19 He therefore refutes the idea of poetic fusion: "Beyond the pole of the so called human, beyond it yet not at all at the opposed pole, that of 'the animal' or of 'the life of the animal', there can be found a heterogeneous multitude of forms of being, ... a multitude of ways of organising the relations between being and death . . ." (282). Yet this does not imply that the literary imagination has nothing to contribute to the understanding of animality; on the con- trary, like De Fontenay, Derrida insists that "thinking the animal is the domain of poetry" (Derrida 258). Not a collapsing of the two opposed poles, then, but, rather, the attempt to replace opposition by a kind of "inter-animality," to use a term suggested by Maurice Merleau-Ponty (qtd. in De Fontenay 653). Derrida's remark has an important aesthetic dimension, for it seems to invite us to return to the long tradition of literary anthropomorphism and to try to rein- vent it (in light, certainly, of the discoveries of primatology)- in other words, to explore the "nature of likeness" in exploring nature. For Derrida, this raises, as he puts it, "the immense question of pathos" (277). In sum, if Costello's defense of animal rights is the expression of a certain suffering (a desperate attempt "to save her soul," as she insists [LA 43]), this is a pathos Coetzee invites, even provokes his readers to respond to critically.20</page><page sequence="12">388 isle The difference between Costello's primitivism and Coetzee's ironic representation of it can be rephrased by using Margot Norris's concept of "biocentrism," which describes a way of treating "the animal (including the human animal), as [one] do[es] Nature, the realm of the biological: as a plenum" (4). According to Norris's study, writers representing a biocentric strain in the Western cultural tradi- tion take their cue from Darwin and Nietzsche; she turns to Lawrence, Kafka, and, in the pictorial arts, Max Ernst as examples. Biocentrism, essentially, has its roots in modernism, and one can well imagine Costello being interested in the same writers and artists as Nortis. Yet, despite the seeming agreement between Norris and Costello, there is an important difference. Biocentrism, Norris insists, must not be conceived as a norm antithetically opposed to anthropo- centrism, as a "democratic extension of recognition and protection to natural, organic, unconscious life" (24). That is roughly how Costello's position could be described: literature as an ecological counter-norm. Biocentrism, however, is neither a stance nor a norm but a challenge to representation. To quote Norris again: "For biocen- tric thinkers, then, mimesis acquires a negative value inimical to the animal's power and to the body's life . . ., an insight that required artists to re-evaluate the ontological status of their media as negative being, as mere simulacra of life" (5). In other words, animality puts mimesis under the pressure of continual revision. Sensitivity to this kind of pressure, to the need "to re-evaluate the ontological status of [his] media," is clearly what distinguishes Coetzee's aesthetics from his main character's romantic primitivism. Though there is a contin- uum between nonhuman and human animals, the continuum of life, there exists no absolute criterion that would allow us to judge the closeness to nature of any given text, for, as Adorno warns, "[i]n every perception of nature there is actually present the whole of society" (101). That is why the "ecological work" of language is not a question of copying nature but instead a question of continually revi- sing and re-evaluating the means of its representation. Lives invites us to share Costello's concern with the fate of animals; it incites us, as do Derrida and De Fontenay, to consider the aesthetic as a form of ecological thinking. Yet the text's metafictional form also leads us to question the power of mimesis as a means of making sense of the lives of animals. The aesthetics explored by Norris and Coetzee thus amounts to a self-conscious and self-critical form of mimesis, in con- tradistinction to the primitivism Costello develops in her interpreta- tions of Kafka, Rilke, and Hughes. My argument here takes its cue from Th.W. Adorono's Aesthetic Theory- a text that proposes a sys- tematic critique of mimetic representations of nonhuman nature but</page><page sequence="13">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 389 that also offers a plea in favor of their re-evaluation and re-invention. True, when Adorno insists that writers should try in representing nature to strive for "the artistic expression of its negativity," (100) that negativity seems to him to be so absolute as to almost preclude the possibility of re-evaluating existing literary forms.21 And yet, in his critical theory communion with nature, or, in Costello's terms, "sym- pathetic imagination," represents the Utopian perspective of mimesis, a utopia beyond anthropocentrism and the commodification of non- human nature: "The image of nature survives because its complete negation by artefacts would necessarily involve closing one's eyes to the possibility of a sphere beyond bourgeois work and commodity relations" (Adorno 102). To paraphrase Adorno with respect to the questions that concern us here: the image of animals suggests the continuity of life in a sphere beyond nature's reification and exploita- tion but only when the animals' otherness or "negativity" is respected. Such self-critical mimesis is one way in which language could be said to be doing "ecological work." In the case of Lives , this work consists in exploring the ethical problem of how to speak for the animal other, avoiding, on the one hand, the anthropocentrism or ethnocentrism of "ecology managers" (Costello's own term [LA 53]) and, on the other, the dangers of aesthetic primitivism. In what direction, to conclude, could the "ecological work" of lan- guage and, more specifically, the work of critically exploring the "nature of likeness" between the lives of nonhuman and human animals be further developed without falling into Costello-like con- tradictions? As my reading of Lives has tried to show, the representa- tion of animals and thus of empathy with their lives or with their plight is not primarily a problem of finding the right words (or even of avoiding anthropomorphism). Rather, what needs to be under- stood is the relation of "significant otherness"22 between humans and animals. The animal's is an otherness that keeps signifying ourselves and is hence multiple, constantly productive and changing through the course of history and culture (as, for example, Kafka's re-interpretations of the beast fable show). For this reason, animal images, even the most blatantly anthropomorphic ones, over and above their quality as imitations inevitably reveal a history of human/ animal contact.23 Furthermore, foregrounding the contact-side of animal representation is what makes the approach to mimesis sug- gested in Lives and theorized by Norris and, on a different level, Adorno, self-critical and also biocentric. This approach stands in stark contrast to traditional Platonic mimesis, which amounts to "mere simulacra of life" (Norris) since it stresses the aspect of imita- tion. Using Gilles Deleuze's language, we could say that exploring</page><page sequence="14">390 ISLE the contact side of animal-representation is a question of emergence or becoming rather than of sameness. Deleuze's theory of "becoming animal" (devenir-animal) is in fact a radical alternative to romantic primitivism. As I understand it, this concept defines the opposite of primitivism, namely, a destabilization of norms and conventions in representing human/animal relations, a process that Anne Sauvagnargues describes as "thinking the animal as a becoming a-normal (devenir anomal) of the human" (163, translation mine).24 Alluding to Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963), Deleuze explains that "becoming animal" should not be thought in terms of imitating animals: "Becoming is never imitating. When Hitchcock wants to do birds, he does not reproduce the cry of any bird, he produces an elec- tronic sound like an expanding field of intensity or a wave of vibra- tions, a continuous variation that is like some terrible threat we feel within ourselves" (Mille Plateaux 375, translation mine). Hitchcock, in Deleuze's view, does not pretend to get the birds right, to represent their essence, but to evoke their significant otherness, almost as if he were translating their cries so as to make them resonate within the spectator (25). With respect to our reading of Coetzee's Lives , Deleuze's claim that the writer should speak "for" animals seems particularly relevant (L'Abécédaire). He does not pretend, as does Costello, to speak instead of animals, as their (privileged) representa- tive. On the contrary, he explains that we should try to speak from their position (à la place de), which is less a form of advocacy than a kind of rhetoric. Such rhetoric would refashion more conventional forms of language until they reach the limits of intelligibility, those limits, as De Fontenay explains, "where the distinction between the rational and the irrational, between language and silence or between music and a scream becomes so tenuous that the writer finds himself responsible before the mouse folk, as in Kafka, or before the rats, as in Hofmannsthal" (35, translation mine). The responsibility of the writer to animals would thus consist in the attempt to put into lan- guage what their otherness signifies to us, the human animals, and thus to make new forms of expression emerge. Coetzee himself could be said to be allegorizing this responsibility to animals when, at the end of his novel Disgrace (1999), he shows his hero playing on a child- ren's banjo to an audience of death-bound dogs in a pound the music of an opera he is composing, as if the theme of that work (the lan- guishing of Teresa Countess Guiccioli, Byron's mistress) emanated from the suffering of the dogs and could only be represented by the broken sounds of the banjo. If the theme of the opera is somehow like the dogs' plight, still the sounds of the banjo do not pretend to imitate the dogs- they emerge not from a sense of sameness but</page><page sequence="15">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 391 from a sense of contact. Therefore, the scene only superficially sym- bolizes the character's "going to the dogs," using the dogs to mock the novel's hero; it can alternatively be read as Coetzee's attempt to become responsible, in Deleuze's sense, to the dogs. Like Kafka's "Report," the scene amounts to a beast fable that strains at its figural- ity. In Disgrace , published the same year as Lives and thus a kind of companion piece to the lecture-fiction, Coetzee has evidently sug- gested an alternative to Costello's primitivism, an alternative that works at "decenter[ing] the habitual configurations" (Skinner). Notes 1. Henceforth abbreviated as LA in parenthetical references in the main text. The two parts of Lives were later integrated almost unchanged into Coetzee's novel Elizabeth Costello (New York: Viking, 2003) which shows the eponymous writer-heroine in a series of representative situations over the course of her life, situations of moral and intellectual conflict and crisis. These are frequently public occasions such as lectures; Coetzee calls them "lessons" rather than "chapters." The term lesson is of course ambiguous, pointing at once to the authoritarian genre of discourse the novel imitates and to the way the heroine's language and style tend to undermine her authority. 2. Of his four Princeton respondents, only literary critic Marjorie Garber seemed to appreciate Coetzee's aesthetics. Peter Singer tried to imitate him by composing a fictionalized conversation about Costello's views without, however, trying to make sense of the author's metafictional strategy; the two other commentators, anthropologist Wendy Doniger and primatologist Barbara Smuts, reacted as if Costello and Coetzee were one and the same person. 3. Lives also contains references in footnotes to the animal rights debate. They have been suppressed in the later novel, which reinforces the impres- sion that Costello's arguments are in fact, to use Attridge's term, " arguings , utterances made by individuals in concrete situations" (ibid.). Employing the same line of argument, Huggan has called The Lives of Animals "a cannily dis- placed apologetics for the poetic imagination" (Huggan 710). 4. Thus Greg Garrard's definition of ecocriticism (Garrard 5). 5. My essay thus proposes a complement to Stephen Mulhall's The Wounded Animal: J.M. Coetzee and the Difficulty of Reality in Literature and Philosophy (2009). In this study, published after this essay was completed, Mulhall takes Lives as a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion of the relation between philosophy and literature. Taking his cue from an essay on Lives by Cora Diamond ("The Difficulty of Reality and the Difficulty of Philosophy"), he reads Coetzee's work as a critical contribution to the ancient yet continuing debate about the status of literary texts in moral philosophy. Diamond's important essay is reprinted in Stanley Cavell et al/s Philosophy and Animal Life (2008). The work of these philos- ophers foregrounds the relation between philosophy and literature; my own, the relation between literary theory and ecology.</page><page sequence="16">392 isle 6. Costello's daughter-in-law Norma, who is in the audience, harshly criticizes the writer's irrationalism. She makes "all the obvious objections," Peter Singer points out in his response to Coetzee's Princeton lecture; he also wonders if Coetzee "really shares Norma's very proper doubts about [Costello's claims]" (LA 91). 7. Cary Wolfe remarks on the insidious relation between species and race in "[the] humanist discourse of species [that] will always be available for use by some humans against the social other of whatever species- or gender, or race, or class, or sexual difference" (Wolfe 8). This relation is explored in other texts by Coetzee, notably his novel Disgrace (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1999). See also my "Species and Race in Coetzee's Disgrace and The Lives of Animals " (unpublished conference paper). 8. Cf. Thomas Nagel. "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" In Mortal Questions. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1976 (cited by Coetzee in Lives 31, note 10). 9. Many of the texts grouped together under the heading "The Human Animal" in part 1 of this anthology exemplify the primitivist yearning for fusion with the animal other. 10. In Stephen Mitchell, ed. Bestiary: An Anthology of Poems about Animals. Berkeley: Frog, 1996: 84. The original German reads: Sein Blick ist vom Vorübergehen der Stäbe so müd geworden, dass er nichts mehr hält. Ihm ist, also ob es tausend Stäbe gäbe und hinter tausend Stäben keine Welt. (In Rainer Maria Rilke. Die Gedichte. Frankfurt a.M.: Insel, 1998: 451.) 11. John Carroll emphasizes "the continuity between human nature and the nature we share with other primates, and, in decreasing degrees with all other animals and living beings . . . but acknowledging the continuity of animal and human nature does not require us to overlook the fact that the arts are themselves one of the most salient and functionally important parts of human nature" (Carroll xxii). Seen thus, poems about animals both chal- lenge and reinforce the "discourse of species," a point that Carroll's own brand of "Darwinian" criticism does not always seem to take seriously. 12. Henceforth cited as "Report" in parenthetical references. 13. On Melincourt cf. Bate (194-99). The most stimulating recent treatment of Kafka's beast fables is by Norris (1985). 14. In her response to Coetzee, Wendy Doniger says that Costello/ Coetzee's reading of Köhler through Kafka has "persuad[ed her] that Coetzee has in fact entered the head of Sultan [one of Köhler's apes] to discover the better questions that the captive ape might have thought about . . ." (LA 103). But, of course, this proves no more, as Doniger herself acknowledges, than that "[n]o one can prove that someone else does not know how animals feel" (LA 103). 15. The neologism Affenwahrheit ironically alludes to other compound words using Affen- in German (Affenschande "crying shame" or Affentheater "nonsense, complete farce") in which the ape-prefix reinforces the disappro- bation contained in the main noun, a typical example of theriomorphism. 16. I am thinking particularly of the metadiscursive reflections of prima- tologists about their use of anthropomorphism in the description of the</page><page sequence="17">Politics of Form in The Lives of Animals 393 behavior of great apes (see e.g. the articles by Jane Goodall and H. Lyn White Miles in Cavalieri and Singer (10-18, 42-57), or the remarks of Frans de Waal on this subject (9-11). 17. See also Derrida's remark that "logocentrism is first and foremost a thesis about the animal, about the animal that lacks the logos , lacks the power that comes from possessing the logos ( privé du pouvoir-avoir le logos)" (278). All translations of Derrida are my own. 18. All translations of De Fontenay are my own. 19. Suivre (to follow) and être après (to be or come after), as Derrida puts it in the French original (Derrida 261). 20. As Boris Cyrulnik reminds us, "when human beings represent them- selves together with animals, they transform the animal into an actor in their play" (16, translation mine). Though Costello's lectures are not plays, they are, as Attridge says, "arguings." For Huggan, as for Elizabeth's daughter-in-law Norma (a member of the fictional audience), her animal rights stance is a "confused mixture of liberal do-goodism and Christian eschatology in which the mission to save lives becomes a displaced quest for self-redemption" (Huggan 712). 21. For a more extensive discussion of the "negativity" of nature in Adomo, see, for example, Jauss (especially 44-45). 22. It is to describe a transformational relation with animals that Donna Haraway employs this term (3 passim), a relation contrasting radically with the conventional speciesism by dint of which the animal as non-person defines the human-as-person. In the "nature-cultural" world we inhabit, Haraway argues, humans and animals are always each other's "companion species," or, put differently, they are co-constitutive (32). 23. The notions of "contact" and of "imitation" are taken from Michael Taussig's reflections on the two-layered nature of mimetic procedures (24). 24. Deleuze indeed plays with the nouns animal and anomal (a neologism), thereby suggesting a connection between animality and the "anomality" of the text. Works Cited Adomo, Theodor W. Aesthetic Theory.
