<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MYCENAEAN FIGURINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS THE fragment of the figurine described below is now at the Museum of Classical Art and Archaeology at the University of Illinois, and is reported to have come from the citadel of Mycenae 1 (Figs. 1-4). It is made of well-sifted yellowish clay, its surface is smoothed by a flat scraping tool, marks of which are clearly evident, and it is cov- ered with a thin yellowish wash or slip. Parts of the head are painted over with a lustrous brown-black paint, which, owing to uneven baking, has, in some places, turned to the well-known Mycenaean reddish hue. The clay, the slip, the paint used, the workmanship, and the incrusted earth which here and there adheres to the sur- face, and which fills all small holes, indicate that the figurine is genuine.2 The head and the neck alone are preserved, with only the tip of the nose slightly chipped. The neck, 0.023 m. in length, is long, rather flat, and rounded at the sides. The face is flat, triangular, and slightly upturned. The forehead is very low, almost non-existent; the orbits are formed by pinching the clay on either side of the nose, thus forming rather prominent and sharp eyebrows, and the eyes are rendered by elliptical dots of paint. The flat cheeks have been shaped by scraping off the clay on either side of the nose, and have been sharply terminated by means of a broad tool. The chin is long and pointed.3 It is well undercut and slightly turned upward. The mouth is rendered by a slanting slit cut with a knife. The aquiline nose is the most prominent feature of the face (Figs. 2, 3). It is 0.02 m. long from the forehead to its tip. It rises from the middle of the low forehead, following the outline of the skull for a while, but beyond the level of the eyes it curves outward boldly to terminate in a broad tilted tip. The nostrils are rendered by two rather deep holes, and the upper lip was formed by cutting the clay to make the triangular base of the nose more prominent; in fact, this last part seems to have been cut by means of a sharp blade or a saw (Fig. 1). Color was used to represent the eyes, and the eyebrows are empha- sized greatly by an irregular band which is continued around the edge of the plane of the cheeks. A broad band of color covers the upper lip extending beyond the slit mouth. The crown of the head is slightly conical; and its surface measures 0.037 m. in length and 0.03 m. in breadth (Figs. 2-4). It is covered with paint, to represent hair, which is gathered up at the back, probably by means of a net. The ears, placed very low and at different levels, are plastically but rudely rendered by means of triangular, slightly convex clay pellets, the outlines of which are indicated by color. A broad band joining the lower ends of the ears and another distinguishable over the break form the only decoration of the neck (Fig. 4). 1 It was acquired by the University in the spring of 1928. I wish to express my thanks to Professor W. A. Oldfather, who secured the piece originally, for comment and assistance, and to Director Windsor for his aid in obtaining the books needed in my studies. I am also under obligation to Mr. Paul Evans for the drawing of fig. 5. 2 The total height of the preserved fragment is 0.068 m.; from the chin to the top of the head, it measures 0.045 m.; the maximum breadth of the face amounts to 0.028 m., while the maximum breadth of the head is 0.035 m. 3 Its length from the lower lip to the point is 0.013 m. 237 THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA</page><page sequence="2">FIG. 1. - -MYCENAEAN STATUETTE.

The color over the crown of the head, of the eyebrows and upper lip clearly indicates hair, while that painted around the ears probably marks the outline of those parts. The broad band which frames the features of the face could be conceived as indicating hair or as marking the limits of the face (Fig. 2). The pointed chin, however, and the fact that the band is a continua- tion of that marking the eyebrows, seem to prove decidedly that hair is indicated at the edge of the plane of the face, and, therefore, that the figure represented is bearded. This is further suggested by a female statuette found at Mycenae by Professor Tsountas,' on which the band around the face is naturally omitted, although the eyebrows and the crown are covered with paint. The band over the lip of our figure indicates that the figure also wore a moustache. The date of the figurine cannot be established from the level in which it was found, since that is unknown, but there can be no doubt that it belongs to the well-known family of Mycenaean figurines which appear at the beginning of the Late Helladic III period.2 It presents strong similarities to the female figure found by Professor Tsountas in the 40th chamber tomb of Mycenae, to the male figurine found by Schliemann in the citadel of the same city,' and to that discovered by the Swedish expedition at Asine.4 Unfortunately for the first two, we have no data which can place them within definite chronological limits, but Professor Nilsson states that the example from Asine was found with vases of the granary style.5 It consequently belongs to the closing years of the Late Helladic III period and this has been ac- cepted by the excavator, Professor Axel W. Persson, who dates the shrine in which it was found at about 1200 B.C.6 The Asine figure, however, in respect to technique seems to be more advanced than ours; especially noticeable is the modelling of the forehead and the more elaborate arrangement of the hair. That toward the end of the Late Helladic III period the artisans at Mycenae could produce figures as elaborate and as true to nature as the Asine idol is proved by the stucco head discovered in 1896 on the citadel of Mycenae.7 Yet technical differences at a time when plastic art was still feeling its way cannot be depended upon absolutely, and, unless supple- mented by other evidence, should not be considered as decisive proof. The addi- tional evidence required is provided by a superficial and yet important factor: by the personal appearance of the people in the Late Helladic period. The Asine statuette represents a male bearded figure with the upper lip cleanly 1 Eph. Arch., 1888, pls. 9-15.

MYLONAS shaven. In a similar manner the hoplites on the well-known warrior vase from Mycenae, the gold heads of the silver cup, and the ivory head of a warrior from the chamber tombs of Mycenae are represented with long wedge-shaped beards, but with the upper lip shaven.' All these representations, however, belong to the closing years of the Late Helladic III period.2 In earlier remains, in masks from the fourth and the fifth shaft graves, the rulers are represented wearing a moustache.3 It is evident that the fashion of shaving the moustache was introduced to Mycenae and to the Mycenaean world at a late period and probably well after the beginning of the Late Helladic III era.4 Our statuette represents a bearded man wearing a mous- tache (Figs. 1-3); it was, therefore, made before the custom of shaving the upper lip became prevalent, and likewise at a time when modelling of the human form was not far advanced. Consequently it was made before the Asine example, or any of the other known male figurines, and possibly at an early date in the Late Helladic III period. The clay and the place in which the figure was found indicate that it was pro- duced in a Mycenaean workshop. The flat surfaces of the neck and the face, the treat- ment of the crown of the head, the undercutting, the use of a blade or saw, the making of the eyes, nostrils, and ears, and the general feeling of the work seem to in- dicate that it was not produced by a coroplast, but by an experienced wood- or bone- carver, experimenting in a new material. That such artisans existed in Mycenae is proved by the various gold and ivory articles decorated in repousse or incised work. That they were willing to handle other material than wood and bone is proved also by the Mycenaean stelae. It is, therefore, quite possible to recognize in our figure the work of a wood- or bone-carver, and to believe that it was produced at an early stage in the Late Helladic III period. Morphologically the figurine belongs to the type established in the Cyclades during the early part of the Bronze Age. The upturned triangular face, the prominent nose, and the long neck are characteristic of those early representations of the human form. We naturally wonder whether there was any connection between the Cycladic and the Mycenaean types, seemingly separated by a long period of years. The late Professor Tsountas believed such a connection existed,5 while Professor Nilsson excludes such dependence and suggests an independent development in the two sections." The dates of the Cycladic culture, represented by the graves of Amor- gos, Paros, and Syros, are not, however, definitely established.' In the cemetery of Haghios Kosmas we found a Cycladic marble figurine in a burial dating from the clos- ing years of a cemetery and settlement whose life was brought to an end apparently by the Minyan invasion. We can presume that if the Early Helladic settlers of Hagh- ios Kosmas continued to inhabit their village during the Middle Helladic period, they would have continued to produce and place figurines in their graves even at a later date. Such may have been the case in the Cyclades, which, as far as we know, were not occupied by Minyan tribes. In fact, in one of the graves of Chalandriane, 1 Furtwiingler-Lischcke, Mykenische Vasen, pls. 42-43; Eph. Arch., 1888, pls. 7-2 and 8-12. 2 Pottier in R.

It is quite possible, then, to accept the view that the period which separates the Cycladic and the Mycenaean figurines is not so great as heretofore believed, and that influence of the one on the other is not altogether impossible. The supposition of influence is strengthened when we remember the sudden appearance of the figurines in the Mycenaean world, their similarly sudden appearance in Minoan graves as soon as Cycladic influence ap- peared in Crete in the Early Minoan period,2 and the complete absence of figurines in Late Minoan graves. Cycladic influence on the Mainland of Greece can be traced in the Cyclopaean walls, especially at Tiryns, which, as pointed out by Professor Tsountas, may have been built by islanders.3 Interesting evidence is obtained from a silver band discovered at Syros. The date of that band is not definitely established, but it seems to be later than that of the well-known Cycladic "frying pans."4 The latter at Haghios Kosmas were produced until the closing years of the Early Helladic period.' Consequently the band should belong to a period corresponding to the Middle Helladic years of the mainland. The same dotted technique employed in decorating the band is found in a diadem and three pendants from the IVth shaft grave of Mycenae, from which the band is not so very far removed in date.6 At one end of the Syros band a bird-shaped figure is preserved, representing possibly an idol,' and offering striking similarities to the later Mycenaean figurines. These simi- larities can be explained only if we assume that the makers of the latter knew the type established in the islands and illustrated by the example from Syros. We may finally conclude that with our present data we cannot exclude Cycladic influence on Mycenaean figurines, and that the latter can be included in the type established in the islands in the Early Helladic Age. We are again on uncertain ground when we try to establish the purpose of these Late Helladic figurines and their identity. Schliemann discovered more than two hun- dred in the citadel of Mycenae alone,8 and yet more have been found in practically all the excavated Late Helladic sites; and still the purpose which they served is a matter of conjecture. With very few exceptions these figurines represent females. Schliemann, because of his great faith in Homer, identified them with Hera; Tsountas divided them into types and accepted them as representations of god- desses;9 Professor Nilsson pointed out that such figurines are found in sanctuaries, in graves, and a few in houses, and that they can be divided into three groups; votive offerings, gifts to the dead, and idols of a household cult. Specimens belonging to the second group are the most numerous and present the greatest difficulties. I Eph.

MYLONAS Professor Nilsson believes that they were placed in graves to provide a luxurious after-life for the poor,' but strangely enough female figurines are almost universally found in graves, although probably a host of male slaves worked for the comfort of the powerful master in actual life. Professor Persson believes them to be "substi- tutes for wives and perhaps for female slaves,"'2 in which case we must presume that they were placed in the graves of male members of a community only. Further, it has been noticed that these figures are found in the poorer graves. Gold, silver, jewelry and beautiful vases are found in the graves of the rich. These offerings seem to indicate that human beings then as now were more than anxious to assure them- selves of comforts and to heap up securities against an unknown future. And if the figurines could secure the much-sought-for comfort, one would naturally expect to find them in all the graves. Their cost was very small and their manufacture easy, while the spacious graves of the period were in no danger of being overcrowded with such gifts. The fact that figurines were found in some of the richer graves seems to indicate that the wealthy were not entirely averse to using them. It is more probable that differences in burial customs were responsible for the rich or the poor kterismata and that such differences are exemplified by the placing of figurines in some of the graves only. Differences in burial customs are further suggested by the variations noticed in the construction of the graves, in the laying of the gifts in the chamber or in the dromos, in the discovery of gems in some groups, and of ivory objects in others.3 In practically all excavated Mycenaean sites female figurines were found among the ruins of the houses and lately these have been discovered in the sanctuary of Asine. At least the Asine examples served as idols of a female deity. In comparing the figures from graves with the cult idols we find that they are identical in shape. Two of the Asine examples, at least, are identical with figurines of the second, and possibly the later, type found in graves. If we accept the theory that the grave fig- urines are simply personal attendants destined to provide comfort for the deceased, we can hardly explain their similarity to cult idols. To give the form of the Goddess to beings of such inferior standing seems incredible; and the natural conclusion appears to be that the grave figurines also represent deities, if those found in houses and at Asine are cult idols.4 With our present knowledge, of course, we cannot be dogmatic and certain of our interpretations, but on the other hand we are not justified in rejecting what seems to be the only plausible explanation supported by the evidence at our disposal. The different types of figurines can be accounted for by the fact that some may be earlier and others later, and by the assumption that different functions of the same deity or various deities with different functions are 1 Nilsson, op. cit., p. 264; D.

Holland has suggested that the band which usually runs up the back of Mycenaean figurines is not a braid but a snake which is an attribute of deity, in J. P. Harland, op. cit., p. 32. If this identifi- cation be correct, then the figurines are proved to represent goddesses.</page><page sequence="7">A MYCENAEAN FIGURINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS 243 represented.1 Such an interpretation is essential because of the numerous representa- tions of the Cretan Goddess, who is now distinguished as mother of the mountains, goddess of the tree-cult, of domestic cult, of sea-faring, etc., and is pertinent for the mainland deity.2 When we turn to male representations we find that their number is exceedingly small, in sharp contrast with the astonishingly large number of female figurines. Even though we may consider that these were made in materials other than clay, we still have very few examples to study. Probably the best known male figures are the two bronze statuettes found at Tiryns by Schliemann and at Mycenae by Pro- fessor Tsountas, who accepted them as importations from the East 3 (Fig. 5 h, i). Their workmanship, however, and especially their similarity to clay figures, which, though barbarous in appearance, were certainly produced in Mycenaean workshops, seem to indicate that they were made locally. Sir Arthur Evans identified these two statuettes with the Syrian Lightning God Resheph, on the evidence of their high conical caps and of the position of their arms.4 But we doubt if these two elements can wholly justify the identification, since we find them in other Mycenaean repre- sentations that have no connection with Syrian or Egyptian deities. Some of the warriors on the famous silver rhyton from the VIth shaft grave at Mycenae wear conical helmets.' The ivory head of a warrior from a Mycenaean chamber tomb is covered by a conical helmet, and a similar but taller and narrower helmet appears on the ivory head from Spata 6 (Fig. 5 k). Representations of the human form on Mycenaean vases are rare and usually late. Yet we possess at least three sherds on which warriors presumably are depicted wearing a high conical cap. All three were found at Mycenae by Schliemann. The first is illustrated and described by its discoverer. The figure on it "has a very large eye" (reminiscent of the men on the fishermen vase from Phylakopi) "and a headdress in the form of a Phrygian cap "7 (Fig. 5 g). On the second sherd a warrior (?) is represented wearing a very high conical helmet made of leather, and on the third the high conical cap of a man is bordered with vertical small lines especially noticeable in the Warrior vase (Fig. 5 d, e).8 Moreover, the helmets of the bronze statuettes do not terminate on the top in the smooth and rounded point of the Egyptian " white crown " (Fig. 5 f), but in well- formed flat buttons similar to those found on the helmets of the ivory heads which served to hold the plume (Fig. 5 h, i, k). If we now turn to the position of the hands, we shall find that the posture is a com- mon one to warriors brandishing a lance with the right arm and holding the shield on the left, bent at the elbow. Representations of such warriors are not unusual in 1 Cf. C. W. Blegen, Zygouries, pp. 205-206. Cf., however, A. J. B. Wace, Chamber Tombs at Mycenae, p. 215; Persson, op. cit., p. 85.

Tsountas, in describing the statuettes, pointed out their similarity to warriors painted on a Late Helladic III vase discovered by Schliemann in Tiryns 1 (Fig. 5 b). Some of the hoplites on the well-known Warrior vase from My- cenae are painted in an identical position 2 (Fig. 5 a) and we find them again repre- sented with the right hand raised and the left bent at the elbow on the stele dis- covered by Tsountas in the grave of Kato Peghadi at Mycenae 3 (Fig. 5 j). It is impossible to believe that all these figures represent Resheph; the conical helmet and the position of the arms prove that the bronze statuettes are warriors and not images of the lightning god. A third male statuette, made of lead, was found in the beehive tomb of Kampos in Laconia by Professor Tsountas in 1890.4 It has been variously interpreted as an idol, an athlete, and a flute-player. We have seen that the real significance of figures placed in graves is not yet determinable, and therefore we shall limit ourselves to the fact that the Kampos statuette served as a kterisma. The specimens made in clay are fewer still and less well known. A male clay statuette was discovered at the Chapel of Haghia Triada, to the south of the village of Haghios Vasileios in the Argolid. With it were found about 200 female and animal figures in a heap, on the east terrace of the chapel.5 They were evidently votive offer- ings, and such a purpose was served by the male statuette also. Such votive idols are especially well known from sanctuaries in Crete, from Petsofa and the Dictaean cave particularly.6 A second male figurine was discovered by Schliemann at Mycenae, but it can give us no definite information.' The male examples cited thus far repre- sent warriors, or served as offerings placed in graves or dedicated in a shrine. We have seen that some of the female figurines represent a deity which is also depicted on signet rings and on plaques. It is natural to wonder whether similar contemporary representations of a male god existed and whether any of the male figurines could be accepted as cult idols. Tsountas has identified a male God, possibly Zeus, on the limestone tablet dis- covered by him on the Acropolis of Mycenae.8 The figure at the center of the com- position almost entirely covered by an 8-shaped shield certainly represents a deity, because on either side of it are two female worshippers. A closer examination of the tablet, in the light of our present knowledge of the conventions of Minoan painting, enabled Professor Rodenwaldt to prove that the central figure is not a male but a female deity, and that the worshippers were offering homage to a female deity of war, a forerunner of Athena.9 A second source of information, the well-known sig- 1 Eph.

MYLONAS net ring from the citadel of Mycenae, offers no more help.' On the bezel of this ring a cult scene is certainly engraved,2 in which an important part is played by a God- dess seated under her sacred tree. A small rigid figure holding an 8-shaped shield and possibly a spear engraved above the votaries seems to be hovering in the air. This small figure was believed to be a war God. We find it impossible, however, to determine whether the figure is male or female, now that the shield and spear have been proved to be the characteristics of a female war Goddess. Consequently no argument for the existence of a male God can be based on this representation; or, in fact, on some of the other scenes on signet rings, since the cult character of these representations must be established first.3 Signet rings, therefore, that shed light on the Mycenaean-Minoan female deity are of little value as evidence for a male God. Our last information is derived from Asine. There, in the summer of 1906, a hall, evidently a shrine, was found, and among its contents was the fragment of a male idol.4 This might be either a votary or a cult idol. We can recall that in the shrine of Knossos such a votary was found holding a dove.5 The size of the Asine idol, how- ever, indicates that the male statuette was not only a cult idol, but, as Professor Nilsson rightly asserts, that it was the chief idol of the sanctuary.6 The work of the Swedish expedition at Asine, therefore, proved that towards the end of the Late Helladic III period male cult idols existed on the mainland of Hellas. The study of the existing Mycenaean figurines makes clear that we have very few male statuettes from Late Helladic times, and that they fall into four classes or groups. To the first belong representations of warriors; to the second, offerings placed in graves; to the third votaries; and to the fourth cult idols. To which of these four classes does the figure at the University of Illinois belong? It cannot be a repre- sentation of a warrior, because it does not wear a helmet, and for the same reason it cannot be a representation of a king or a ruler. The size of the figure, its similarity to the Asine idol, its careful modelling and rendering of the features of the face con- trast greatly with the size and summary rendering of the known clay figures placed in graves or found in votive heaps, and indicate that our specimen did not serve as a kterisma or as a votive offering. This is further indicated by the report, which by it- 1 Furtwiingler, Die antiken Gemmen, I, pl. 2, fig. 20; D. Fimmen, Die kretisch-mykenische Kultur, fig. 56; R. Arch., 1900, pl. 8; Bossert, op. cit., p. 28833, fig. 394 c.; Evans, op. cit., II, p. 341 and fig. 194 e. 2 Although Mayer in Jb. Arch, I., 1892, p. 191, believes that it represents a princess with her attend- ants; the small figure is a soldier attendant who stands as a sentinel in the background. Milchh6fer, in his Anfdnge der Kunst, p. 136, sees in the small armed figure a representative of the Curetes or Cory- bantes "who dance attendance on Rhea Cybele, clashing spear on shield." 3 Such a scene we find on the electrum ring discovered by Tsountas in 1893 in the lower city of Mycenae. It represents a male figure standing before a seated female figure: Sir Arthur Evans, J.H.S. XXI, 1901, p. 175, fig. 51; Furtwuingler, III, p. 36, fig. 14. But there is nothing to prove that the scene is not secular and the figures human beings. The same could be stated for the ring from Vapheio (Eph. Arch., 1889, pls. 10-39; Furtwaingler, I, pl. 2, fig. 19); for the ring from Mycenae with "a mourning scene for a divine, youthful hero" (Furtw~ingler, III, p. 56; Evans, I, fig. 116); for the ring in the Ash- molean Museum (Nilsson, op. cit., p. 296, fig. 85) and even for the ring from Knossos with the descend- ing figure holding a spear (Evans, I, fig. 115) or the figure on the sarcophagus from Milato (J.H.S. XXI, 1901, p. 174, fig. 50). In general see Nilsson, op. cit., pp. 343 ff. 4 Sir Arthur Evans, P.M. IV, pp. 756 f. considers this idol a female representation. His objections have not been answered by the excavators of Asine, but the Illinois specimen proves that the pointed chin was also a male feature and could in certain cases represent a beard. 5 Evans, II, p. 339, fig. 1992. 6 Nilsson, op. cit., pp. XXII ff.</page><page sequence="11">A MYCENAEAN FIGURINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS 247 self could not be considered decisive, that the figure was not found in a grave or in a cache of votive offerings. We have only the fourth group left and to it we must ac- cordingly ascribe our specimen. It is possible to accept the Illinois figurine as a cult idol of a male God, if that of Asine is to be so interpreted. The "Lord of Asine" belongs to the closing years of the Late Helladic III period. The Illinois figurine is a little earlier and since it is earlier than any of the other male statuettes discovered thus far, it can be conceived as the earliest known representation of a male cult idol from the mainland of Greece. Because of this, and because of the fact that only three other male figures made in clay are known from the Mycenaean world, this broken fragment possesses a very special interest.1 It is impossible to identify the God whose cult idols appear in Late Helladic times. He cannot have been a war God, since that office was held by a Goddess, whose image we have in the stucco tablet and possibly also in the signet ring from Mycenae. It is natural to presume that the Late Helladic people would make cult idols of their main God and identify these representations with the father of Gods and of men, with Zeus. Our evidence, however, is slight, and any such identification, although tempting, is speculative, and will need to be backed by stronger and more compelling evidence before it can be accepted. But such a supposition allows us to remark that the Indo-European tribes of the mainland of Hellas, with the opening years of the Late Helladic period begin to represent their Gods in human form. The old ani- conic character of their religion2 is giving way, possibly under the influence of Crete, to that anthropomorphism which exercised such a profound influence on the birth and development of the historic arts of Hellas. The "Lord of Asine" and the similar figure at Illinois can be conceived as heading the long procession of divine statues on which the glory of Hellas rests in such a large measure. GEORGE E.

That these Middle Helladic sites were occupied by the earliest Indo-European tribes that descended in Greece was proved by Professor Blegen. Cf. Haley-Blegen, in A.J.A.
