<plain_text><page sequence="1">Japanese Works in The Art Institute of Chicago: Five Recent Acquisitions JAMES T. ULAK Associate Curator ofJapanese Art The Art Institute of Chicago n May 1992, the galleries of East Asian art at The Art Institute of Chicago opened to the public after several years of planning and renovation. These galleries feature the museum's extensive holdings of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean art, and their configura- tion reflects the patterns of nearly a century of collect- ing. The establishment of the Department of Oriental Art in 1922 was, in fact, preceded by nearly a quarter cen- tury of astute collecting. Central to the Japanese collection was the Clarence Buckingham Collection of Japanese Woodblock Prints. Formally acquired in 1925, the col- lection had been housed at the Art Institute since 1914, a year after Buckingham's death. While this world- renowned collection sometimes overshadowed other aspects of the Japanese materials, a consistent pattern of acquisition in other areas of Japanese art paralleled the growth of the print collection. Through several genera- tions, a succession of curators seemed to reach tacit accord on a philosophy of collecting. Selecting from great diversity, three specific types of art were deemed especially desirable: the woodblock print and themati- cally related painted images, religious iconography, and decorative painting. In reviewing major acquisitions of Japanese art made during the past decade, it is not surprising that works in each of the categories mentioned above are most promi- nent. This essay examines works from all of these cate- gories. The first of these works is a portrait of the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma, which com- bines appropriate psychological intensity with an opu- lent realism (pl. 2 and fig. I). This sixteenth-century icon is especially striking in its affinity to warrior portraits of the period. The second work discussed is a pair of six- panel screens dating from the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century that depicts a lush cornucopia of millet under sun- and moonlight (figs. 4a-b). These screens are unique in their compositional presentation and replete with symbolic intention. The last part of the essay examines three works by the print designer and painter Katsushika Hokusai (pls. 3-5 and figs. 7-9). For nineteenth-century European and American collectors, the name Hokusai was virtually synonymous with Jap- anese art. His most prolific and creative period was in the 183os, when he was in his seventies. Hokusai designed Chie no umi, a print series depicting the customs of fish- ing, for a small format, and initially ten images were pro- duced. The extreme rarity of these prints suggests that the series was discontinued and was perhaps a commer- cial failure. The Art Institute was able to acquire three images from this series. They stand as a jewel-like distil- lation of Hokusai's haunting vision of a natural world undulating with life and as remarkable examples of the printmaker's art. Daruma The predominance of Japanese Buddhist iconography in the Art Institute's collection of Asian art reflects two important eras in the history of that religion. The first FIGURE i. Japan.

This icon of the patriarch Bodhidharma, while faithful to thirteenth- century prototypes, exudes a worldly vitality notable in sixteenth- century art and bears a strong resemblance to secular Japanese portraiture of the period. 175</page><page sequence="2">?~ ~ ~ : ..? ..,:. i +i .~~? .. ?j,..:ki .. ,,S' ? .: ?I:qB~,- '?,.: ?.,.!: .....

While this era was marked by numerous stylistic changes and shifts in focus, doctrine, and patronage over the course of five centuries, the Buddhism of this period was devoted almost exclusively to the needs of the aristocracy. Indeed, there were many points when the ecclesiastical and secu- lar authority virtually melded. The second era, which occurred in tandem with and was simultaneously stimu- lated by the political overthrow of the ruling Kyoto aris- tocracy in the late twelfth century, included a variety of populist revival movements embracing all social classes. These movements generally offered radically simplified and humanely consoling formulas for salvation. Aristo- cratic Buddhism relied heavily on ritual and demanded a complex iconography, reflecting a courtly manner in its measured, regal, and somewhat remote style. Populist Buddhism made as many demands on artists' work- shops, although the results were more narrative in com- position, evoking divine accessibility and suggesting visually the rewards of the afterlife. Notable examples of the earlier, aristocratic Japanese Buddhist works in the Art Institute's collection include the wood and lacquer sculptures of a seated Bodhisattva and Bishamon-ten. The museum's examples of the later populist Buddhism, which are reflected mainly in the iconography of Pure Land Buddhism, include Descent of the Amida Trinity, Seated Bodhisattva, and Legends of the Yuizu- Nembutsu (fig. 2), a painting that describes the origins of a proto-Pure Land Movement sect. Pure Land Buddhism was generally dismissive of esoteric approaches, and its practitioners encouraged recitation of a simple hymn of praise: Namu Amida Butsu, "all praise the Lord Amida." This prayer sufficed as a means of eventual access to the Western Paradise. Less prominently represented in the Art Institute's collection is the art of yet another revolutionary reli- gious force: Zen Buddhism. Zen (or Chan in Chinese) was certainly known in Japan in the seventh century and was absorbed piecemeal by some of the established sects. It was only in the thirteenth century that the emergence of two not dissimilar political forces-one in Japan and the other in China-placed Zen in an unexpectedly dom- inant position in Japan. The Mongol invasions in China overwhelmed the Sung rulers by the last quarter of the thirteenth century and threatened Japan. Zen monks sought refuge under the new military government in Japan, headquartered in the tiny eastern fishing village of Kamakura. These emigre monks espoused a rigorous belief system that had emerged in sixth-century China and, in the course of time, their monasteries also became significant repositories of secular learning. In spite of frequently contentious relationships with a succession of Chinese governments, these monks were widely FIGURE 2. Japan. Legends of the Yhtzu Nembutsu (detail), fourteenth century. Handscroll: ink, color, and gold on paper; 30.5 x 1176.9 cm. The Art Institute of Chicago, Kate S. Buckingham Collection (1956.1256). This narrative painting describes the founding of the Yizui sect, one of several populist Buddhist movements that preached the use of simplified salvific formulas.

In return for a safe haven, they offered their Japanese protectors a style of Buddhism that matched the mood of the new regime, which was militaristic in rigor, and therefore simple and demanding. Furthermore, the emigres offered to their hosts' nascent government a spiritually sympathetic and fully structured religious establishment. At this point, the government saw that it was possible to circumvent the symbiotic relationship between the Kyoto aristocracy and the Tendai sect, which, as the dominant esoteric sect, had a virtual monopoly over the religious beliefs of the aristocracy. Zen Buddhism, under the sponsorship of the military shogunate, would be the new government's means of regulating the often unpredictable forces of religion.' The religious iconography that accompanied the Chinese monks to Japan was considerably developed. The use of imagery in the pursuit of enlightenment has always existed within Zen in a spirit of uneasy compro- mise. From its earliest days, Zen discouraged reliance on transmitted scripture, commentary, or image. In this way, Zen sought to redirect Buddhism to its radical and origi- nal disparagement of the senses. The senses deceive and ensnare in a cycle of desire and pain; that which is learned from the senses, or that on which the senses rely, is fun- damentally suspect. Yet, inevitably, several kinds of images enjoyed pop- ularity. They included, most prominently, images of the Daruma and the five major patriarchs who succeeded him, images of Zen masters, images of certain trans- historical Buddhist deities particularly revered in Zen circles, images of exemplary historical and legendary fig- ures, and nonfigural works such as landscapes or bird- and-flower paintings from which religious insight could be garnered. In some instances, the value of images was in the expression of anecdotal insight into the Zen pro- cess. The Art Institute's image of Nawa, or hemp-robed, Monju Bodhisattva (fig. 3), is typical of this approach. This image evokes the legend of a venerable Chinese scholar who was scorned for his reliance on textual learn- ing by the Monju in the guise of a young monk. The act of composing poetry or of painting, often by amateur hands, was viewed as a tool of spiritual growth. These practices were alternatively encouraged and condemned by Zen masters. The rendering of an ink monochrome landscape became an act of reflection, a mirror of a mind's state. Within the Art Institute's collection, Sesson's Land- scape of the Four Seasons presents a superb example of the infusion of a secular topography with religious nuance by a monk-painter. Until recently, a credible example of patriarchal imagery from the Zen tradition was absent from the Art Institute's collection (see pl. 2 and fig. i). Within the FIGURE 3. Japan.

The deity Monju incarnated as a beautiful young monk was a popular iconographic representation in medieval Zen monasteries. According to the legend recounting his appear- ance, he admonishes all who are too intellectual in their pursuit of enlightenment.

This stately vision of millet fields ripe for harvest is at once decorative and filled with symbolic reference. The confidence exuded in these paint- ings captures the mood of a country finally at peace after long political strife. range of Zen imagery noted above, the categories of patri- arch and master were perhaps the most important. The relationship between master and disciple plays a pri- mary part in Zen Buddhism. For this reason, the image of a revered master takes logical precedence over the icon of a deity. The semilegendary founder of Zen was Daruma (c. 470-c. 543; in Sanskrit the name is Bodhidharma), the twenty-eighth patriarch in a lineage from Sakyamini Buddha. Daruma was an Indian aristocrat who relin- quished power and wealth in search of enlightenment. He journeyed to southern China and, in a cave at the Shaolin monastery, engaged in intense meditation for nine years. Daruma admonished his followers to seek single-mindedly the Buddha nature within, dispensing with a reliance on text or ritual. The emergence of Zen at this moment in Buddhism's eight-hundred-year history suggests that the reform movement was more complex than the traditional hagiography of the founder provides. The movement owes much to Buddhism's early assimila- tion of yogic practices in India and perhaps the melding of those practices with Taoist perspectives in China. Images of Daruma were known in China from the eighth century onward. Essentially, three methods of pre- senting the patriarch became standard. He was depicted full-length, standing on a reed as he coursed miraculously across the Yangzi River en route to Shaolin. He was also portrayed as seated in meditation both in a natural land- scape setting, often at the mouth of a cave, or without a context. Finally, he was depicted in a three-quarter pose bust portrait, as in the Art Institute version. Inscriptions are frequently but not always in the upper portion of these works.2 In the Art Institute portrait (pl. 2 and fig. i), Daruma is represented as an Indian in a rich, sensual fleshiness with full lips and a prominent nose. In this image, the patriarch's head is covered and the enveloping red robe, decorated with medallions, conceals two attributes often depicted in images of this type: earlobes elongated from the weight of earrings, which was a princely mark, and a long fingernail on the left thumb, which was the sign of an ascetic.' Depictions of the supposed inner state of the patriarch range from descriptive to actively engaging. The descriptive mode usually entails the seated or stand- ing meditative figure in the context of a landscape. The viewer is invited to observe an approximation of the "historical moment" of Daruma's primary meditation experience. Noteworthy in most of these images is the depiction of the patriarch's eyes, which gaze to the far distance or are downcast, implying a reflective counte- nance. The mode of engagement depicts the patriarch's eyes bearing directly upon the viewer. This form is most often employed in the half-torso or bust portrait, a style that emerged no later than the early twelfth century. This style of the portrait evokes the intense connection between master and disciple, and suggests as well the 178 ULAK</page><page sequence="6">startling immediacy of enlightenment espoused by Zen. Interpretations of this gaze vary from admonitional and severe to the knowing but benevolent stare rendered in the Art Institute portrait. Prototypes of the Daruma image certainly arrived in Japan with, if not before, the wave of Chinese immigration in the thirteenth century. For example, an ink drawing of the Six Patriarchs of the Bodhidharma Sect dated to the thirteenth century is housed at the temple Kosan-ji in Kyoto and depicts the Zen founder as a clean shaven, bald old man, Chinese in appearance and seated in a chair. This drawing is probably based on a Chinese print or book illustration of the mid-eleventh century.4 The book is probably the earliest extant depiction of the patriarch. Several well-known early images that are also in Japanese collections depict Daruma wearing a red robe impressed with circular gold medallions, and are attributed to Chinese artists. In these examples, an Indian-featured Daruma is seated in a schematically described cave intended to represent his place of meditation at the Shaolin mon- astery. These paintings are among the earliest prototypes for the robe with gold emblems that were available to Japanese artists.' There are also other examples represent- ing the red robe without the medallion motif. The ink-monochrome brush of the Art Institute por- trait outlines and describes a fleshy, sumptuously robed form. While these lines are deftly modulated, far more attention is paid to the face and to the pattern of the robe. The lines contain and describe a form whose cen- tral power derives not from the traditionally expected techniques of the ink-monochrome brush but from a jarring realism created by color, pattern, and enveloping line. These features and the generally mannered sense of this portrait suggest fashionable Japanese painting of the sixteenth century. The facile combination of dexterous brush and lavish color are characteristic of a larger styl- istic current which grew strong near the close of the six- teenth century. The Japanese predilection for bright, pat- terned forms gradually reasserted itself within structures learned from Chinese ink-monochrome and professional painting. The hand of a professional painter knowledge- able in the iconographic requirements of other Buddhist traditions and also experienced in the production of sec- ular portraiture is apparent.' Inscriptions on the reverse of the Art Institute painting indicate that it was remounted in the fourth year of Horeki, which corresponds to the Gregorian calendar year of 1751 and that the painting was in the possession of a certain temple, Shorin-ji. Temples gener- ally strove to have at least important paintings remounted in one-hundred-year cycles. This general calculation allows for a mid-seventeenth century dating at the latest. But a consideration of the stylistic matters noted above comfortably places the date of execution in the mid- sixteenth century. Millet Under the Aspects of Sun and Moon The Art Institute's notable collection of screen paintings was enhanced with the acquisition in 1989 of an impor- tant pair of six-fold screens depicting fields of ripe millet under sun- and moonlight (figs. 4a-b). These screen paintings are striking examples of a type of painting that became increasingly prominent in the mid- to late sev- enteenth century. FIVE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS I79</page><page sequence="7">This pair of six-panel screens presents two views of millet fields. Each field is arrayed in bouquetlike fashion in the lower foreground of the composition. Above the fields, gold-foil clouds break in stylized scallops to reveal deep blue sky and either a circular sun in gold or a moon in silver. The sun screen depicts a field of green leafed but full-headed grain. The moon screen shows a very similar but not identical clustering with the leaf and grain treated in gold hues and covered with a light ink wash. The plants are rendered in remarkable detail. The gold-foil squares that form the cloud background have been heavily restored with gold paint, and the blue pigment of the sky is comparatively garish and quite roughly applied, suggesting later repair to substantially worn or damaged upper halves of both screens. The plant renderings, on the other hand, seem intact. Fortu- nately, the dramatic effect of the stark juxtaposition of finely detailed foreground and nearly blank background is intact, as well. These paintings are unsigned and of a composi- tional type especially popular from the second half of the seventeenth through the early eighteenth centuries. The subjects of these paintings are frequently classical (seasonal plants are in this category) and are described in bright, opaque pigment on a bare, metallic colored or actual foil ground. Often any hint of a transitional mid- dle ground or depth perspective is eliminated. The source for this style is usually traced to Hon'ami Koetsu (I558-1637) and Tawaraya Sotatsu (?-1643?), who worked both independently and as collaborators in the first quarter of the seventeenth century. Later seventeenth- century screens thought to be by followers of Sotatsu FIGURE 5. Japan. Maize and Cockscomb, mid-seventeenth century. Six-fold screen: colors and gold leaf on paper; 59.4 x 169.5 cm. The Art Institute of Chicago, Kate S. Buckingham Endowment (1959.599). In the late seventeenth century, Japanese painters frequently used the large-screen format to depict flora recently imported to Japan. Maize, or corn, was one form of exotica that they chose to paint. increasingly used a compositional device that placed subject matter, particularly plant life, in the foreground of the painting.7 Another well-known Art Institute screen, depicting maize and cockscomb, is a prominent example of this type (fig. 7). While these artists engaged in some of the century's most notably innovative cre- ations, virtually all of the major workshops sensed the important shifts in taste and responded by adapting their respective methods. Millet Under the Aspects of Sun and Moon (figs. 4a-b) seems to be an adaptation of the same formula by a Tosa artist. This family of artists was closely allied with the court since Heian times (794-1185). From the early thir- teenth century, they began to suffer the vicissitudes of their patrons' fortunes, and were particularly eclipsed by the popularity of the Zen-inspired ink-monochrome style. The new stability of the seventeenth century and the renewed interest in court culture drew the Tosa paint- ers at least temporarily into the mainstream. They were propelled by the obvious talents and political acumen of Tosa Mitsuoki (1617-1691), the most prominent repre- sentative of that lineage.8 The Tosa style was generally characterized by repre- sentational or narrative detail and a vibrant palette. A com- I80 ULAK</page><page sequence="8">parison of the millet screens with the plant life renderings in the maize-and-cockscomb screen (fig. 5) is instructive. The latter was rendered generally in an uncircumscribed wash which relied often on a technique that applied wet on partially dried pigment (tarashikomi) for stylized modeling effects. Leaves in the millet screens were executed with light outlining for definition and a false embossing tech- nique of layered paint (moriage) for dimension. Other features of the millet screens also suggest a Tosa lineage. The subject of millet was often used by the Tosa school. Usually millet fields were rendered in a narrative that included depictions of quail, sparrows, or, in one well-known instance, roosters feasting on grain within easy reach. It has been suggested that the theme was not indigenous but adapted from Chinese sources in the fifteenth or sixteenth century.9 The Art Institute millet screens clearly break from that narrative representation. The use of sun and moon in the millet screens was most likely derived from several influences. The earliest prototype for the sun and moon placed within a screen with an ostensibly secular subject can be found in a pair of landscape screens from the early sixteenth century belonging to the Kongo-ji temple in Wakayama Prefec- ture. These works, long admired for their magisterial ele- gance, have been used at the temple as attendant images at ordination ceremonies. In Buddhist iconographic tradi- tion, sun and moon, the most visible of the celestial spheres, represent the cosmos over which Buddhism exercises a benevolent reign. Because the screens were long used in the Buddhist ordination ceremonies held at this Esoteric sect temple, it was assumed that the paint- ings were commissioned for that expressed purpose and that the sun and moon were, in effect, purposeful inclu- sions with religious meaning. While there is no convinc- ing proof for this theory, the fact that viewers have, for some centuries, presumed this intention adds an element of interpretive richness to these or any other screens employing the paired celestial symbols.1" A more directly traceable literary reference in the millet screens is found in the tradition of illustrating the Tales of Ise, a tenth-century uta monogatari, or collection of loosely linked prose episodes that each contain a sec- tion of verse." In the twelfth of the one hundred forty- three episodes comprising the Tales oflse, a young woman of Musashi (an area now in Tokyo's western suburbs) is spirited off by her lover against her family's wishes. Pursued by authorities, they hide in the tall grasses on the Musashi plain. To the west is a vast expanse and, in the far distance, Mount Fuji is visible. As the dragnet closes in on the couple and threatens to burn the grass, the woman cries out for mercy. This poignant episode, when illustrated in a narrative fashion, usually depicted figures hiding from torch-wielding henchmen. The decid- edly more refined and evocative interpretation of this epi- sode, especially in screen format, rendered a foreground of dense, tall flowering grasses on both screens, often FIGURE 6.

Nickerson Endowment (1936.25i). Depictions of the sun and moon at the horizon line behind a field of flowering grasses were often references to literary and historical events associated with the plain of Musashi, an expanse to the west of modern-day Tokyo. FIVE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS I 8</page><page sequence="9">with Mount Fuji's silhouette in the far background. Visible in the grasses at the horizon line is a red sun. In some versions, a moon is depicted on the opposite screen. Yet another category of screen using these images is sim- ply called "sun and moon with autumn grasses"; an exam- ple of this type of screen is in the Art Institute's collection (fig. 6). In neither type are figures depicted. Either of the above types, or their variants, were probable sources for works with dense, complex foregrounds and rather plain, austere backgrounds. Beyond compositional allusions, they transmitted, as well, less easily determined literary and religious references. Another important influence on the design of the millet screens was the newly emergent scientific observa- tion of the time. From a scientific perspective, two fea- tures are noteworthy: the successful attempt to render the contrasting light of midday and of a moonlit night, and the accuracy of the plant renderings. Both features reflect the voracious interests of educated Japanese in the late seventeenth century. Although Japan was closed to nearly all foreign contact with the institution of the sakoku policy in the 1630s, the authorized Dutch trad- ing port at Deshima in Nagasaki continued as an entry way for information from the West as well as from other parts of Asia.12 Gardens containing herbal medicines and rare imported plants were in vogue, and their depictions in ostensibly decorative painting is noted from about this period.13 The simple, bold design of the Art Institute screens provides both a majestic distillation of several converging traditions and a twist of easily overlooked experimentation. Three Prints from the Series Chie no umi by Hokusai As the decade of the 183os opened, Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) was seventy years old, a highly regarded artist, print designer, and book illustrator who had for more than half a century imaginatively visualized the popular culture of Edo (now known as Tokyo). At a point when his achievements had already guaranteed his position in the pantheon of important nineteenth cen- tury artists, Hokusai broke new ground. During the period sometimes called his "golden decade," he trans- formed what had been a secondary interest for print artists-the landscape-into a vitally expressive force. In fairly rapid succession, Hokusai produced his Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku Sanju-Rokkei, c. 1830-32), One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets, as Told by the Nurse (Hyakunin Isshu Uba Ga Etoki, c. 1831), A Tour of Japanese Waterfalls (Shokoku Taki Meguri, c. 1833-34), Eight Views of Ryuiky- (Ryiky- Hakkei, c. 1833), and Rare Views of Famous Japanese Bridges (Shokoku Meikyo Kiran, c. 1834). Some images from among these series are so well known to both the Japanese and Western eye as to be considered synony- mous with the best of Japanese art. Also during this period of intense productivity came perhaps the rarest of his landscape series, Chie no umi (translated as A Thou- sand Views of the Sea or The Wisdom of the Ocean).14 Three complete sets of this series are known. Within that select grouping is a set referred to as the Garland series, so designated because it was auctioned at the FIGURE 7. Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, 1760-I849).

Night fishing, either from a boat or by wading in a stream, has been perennially fascinating for onlookers. Hokusai catered to this curiosity, evoking a sense of anticipation and ritual. 182 ULAK</page><page sequence="10">FIGURE 8. Katsushika Hokusai.

Garland sale in 1945."5 The Garland series was then pur- chased as a unit by a private individual who held it until 1983, when it again became available at auction.16 On that occasion, the Art Institute acquired three of the most dramatic images from the series. Fishing by Torchlight in Kai Province (Koshi7 hiburi) (pl. 3 and fig. 7), Choshi in Shimorsa Province (Soshui Choshi) (pl. 4 and fig. 8), and Whaling off the Goto Islands (Goto kujira-tsugi) (pl. 5 and fig. 9) entered the Art Institute as superb additions to an already substantial collection of Hokusai's works. The remaining seven prints were disbursed among pri- vate collectors.17 If its title is considered literally, the Chie no umi series was projected to run to one thousand prints. Only ten images, however, are known. In addition to some extant preparatory drawings for the known completed prints, an additional two preparatory drawings (Shina- gawa and Kazusu no ura) exist. Printed versions of these images are not known to have been completed, but the drawings clearly suggest that the series was moving beyond the extant ten prints."8 Virtually all of the works in the series contain ele- ments recognizable in other Hokusai prints. Eight of the images are set in specific provinces, seven depict particular fishing techniques, and three reveal vistas with sea-related themes but without specific mention of techniques. The series celebrates life and its dependence on the bounties of the sea and rivers, and it had two important commercial features: it provided a landscape travelogue with an encyclopedic compilation of ocean- and fresh- water-fishing techniques and, with its concentration on depicting water, it offered an opportunity to use a pig- ment recently imported to Japan from Europe called Prussian blue. Roger S. Keyes suggested that Prussian blue was first used in Japan in a print made in Osaka in 1825, and appeared in some designs in Edo in 1829. This deep, bright, and chemically stable blue was resilient in the pres- ence of light and water, and it replaced the traditional organic blues produced from ai (polygonum tinctorium- indigo) and aigami (commelina communis-dayflower), which were notoriously fugitive. The novelty of Prussian blue caused it to be used in a wide variety of prints, some- times as the only pigment in a monochromatic palette."1 The Chie no umi images were produced on a com- paratively small scale. The paper is approximately one- half the size of the sheets on which most familiar eigh- teenth- and nineteenth-century Japanese print images were produced; this rather standard print size is called oban, and it measures approximately thirty-eight by twenty-five centimeters. The individual images in the Chie no umi series are on a paper size called yoko-chiban, measuring approximately nineteen by twenty-six centi- meters. It seems reasonably clear that the yoko-chuiban images were printed in tandem on an oban-size sheet and then cut. For example, Fishing by Torchlight in Kai Province and Whaling off the Gotoi Islands, two of the three prints acquired by the Art Institute, seem to have been initially printed on single sheets. In some, but not all, impressions of the Torchlight print, for example, a miniscule line of a tree top can be seen at the bottom of the print, as can an oversliced remainder of the tree top in the whaling print.2" Printed signatures and seals, as well as FIVE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS 183</page><page sequence="11">FIGURE 9.

Landscape prints began to develop as an alternative to theater and courtesan prints during the late eigh- teenth and early nineteenth centuries. Several factors were at play in this shift of the dominant subject matter. Throughout this period, a series of government reforms attempted to alleviate real economic crises, as well as to exercise a degree of control over a potentially disruptive merchant class. In the rigid, four-tiered neo-Confucian class system imposed by the Tokugawa government, war- riors, farmers, artisans, and merchants were ranked in descending order of importance and privilege. This struc- ture was largely a social fiction because the key to eco- nomic power was held by the merchant (chonin) class. Merchants were the principal patrons of the metropoli- tan pleasure quarters and theaters. In times of economic hardship, the imposition of sumptuary laws on publish- ers curtailed the printing of actor and courtesan prints, and limited the kinds of pigments and precious materials that could be used in the making of prints. These measures were largely symbolic gestures intended to encourage a spirit of austerity and sobriety. In 179o, a 184 ULAK</page><page sequence="12">system of government censorship was instituted that, enforced with varying degrees of severity until 1874, scrutinized the material and subject matter of prints, including attempts at political satire. The popular pleasure genres managed to survive, and often the more controversial types of prints would elude official sanctions, but government watchfulness inevitably necessitated shifts in publishing strategies. Landscape as a subject gradually filled the void and simultaneously responded to growing public interest in the world beyond the demimonde. As travel restrictions in the nineteenth century became less stringent, the great highways (T6kaid6 and Kisokaido) facilitated movement from Edo to Kyoto and points in between. Religious pilgrimage was the ostensible reason for much of the travel by commoners. Print images of popular sites served both as souvenirs for travelers and as tantalizing visions of yet-to-be-seen locales. The increase in popularity of landscape was not sudden. From the beginning of the late seventeenth cen- tury, some use of landscape, however schematic, was visible in prints. By the last quarter of the eighteenth century, landscapes were rendered with increasing care, although they often served as backdrops for the primary figure studies. Hokusai was producing prints with land- scape as the central subject in the last decade of the eigh- teenth century. Because of his prodigious talent and independence, Hokusai had apprenticed in and mastered a range of print formats, an experience not normally available to artists allied with highly specialized schools. His career began under the tutelage of Katsukawa Shunsho (1726- 1792), master of the workshop that dominated the pro- duction of actor and theater prints during the second half of the eighteenth century. After Hokusai's separa- tion from the Katsukawa group in the mid-179os, he worked as a painter and an independent designer of prints, book illustrations, and surimono, the limited-edi- tion prints that were used for poetry.21 His interest in landscape became evident in this period. Along with many other early nineteenth-century artists, he exper- imented with what were understood to be European or Western-style landscapes. Examples were available in books and single sheets largely through intermediary adaptation or copying by the Chinese. The three prints chosen by the Art Institute represent the most dramatic moments in the series. Fishing by Torchlight in Kai Province (pl. 3 and fig. 7) depicts fisher- men wading into swift rapids (Kai Province is now known as Yamashina, which is to the west of Tokyo). Some hold torches to attract fish while others reach into the water to snare the catch. The sky is rendered in an unusually deep black, with specks of stars in white reserve. The immedi- ately surrounding embankment and foliage are rendered in a yellow-orange, suggesting the glow given off from the torchlight. The landscape grows into greens and blue greens as it recedes from the center of lighted activity. The sinuously stylized rapids emerge from a horizontally flowing river at mid-distance and then turn at a ninety- degree angle to fan into vertically cascading rapids in the center of the composition. The Prussian blue is master- fully applied from deep to lighter shades as it moves from the dark distance into the lighted foreground in alternat- ing ribbons of pale and dark blue. In Choshi in Shimosa Province (pl. 4 and fig. 8), two fishing boats struggling in the turbulent sea off the coast of Shimosa near the fishing village of Choshi (in present- day Chiba Prefecture) to the east of Edo is the subject for Hokusai's bravura manipulation of Prussian blue in, once again, alternating shades. The viewer is immedi- ately reminded of Hokusai's Great Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura) from the series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (fig. io). Whaling off the Goto Islands (pl. 5 and fig. 9) depicts a whale as it menaces a wary fleet somewhere in the Goto Islands off Kyushu in the far west of Japan. While it is doubtful that Hokusai ever witnessed a scene like this, other known printed images could easily have supplied him with the inspiration. The whale emerges as a true leviathan, with threatening eye and anthropomorphic qualities. Its form is the center around which blue pig- ment and the churning froth of varying shades are orchestrated. What appear to be vertical stains or imper- fections in the upper left center of the print are actually small columns of smoke rising from fires tended on two of the boats. This detail does not appear on all of the whaling prints and suggests some experimentation with the image.22 In a sense, the prints in the Chie no umi series were an inevitable distillation of Hokusai's long experience in small-scale print design, whether in book illustration or in the more lushly developed surimono. With this series, he effectively blended the intimacy of scale with the power of his larger images. The rarity of extant impres- sions from the series has been noted by collectors since the nineteenth century.23 The paucity of examples sug- gests either that the works were commercial failures or were actually produced for an initially limited audience. It has been suggested that the prints in this series have a uniformly "muddy" quality, the result of the artist intend- ing to approximate in some way the darker features of Western oil painting. There are indeed other examples of Hokusai's involvement in such experiments.24 Whatever the initial response to this series, its appreciation among collectors has been constant throughout the late nine- teenth and twentieth centuries.

There is some confusion in determining the date by which this piano arrived at Darmstadt. Interior views of the completed rooms at Darmstadt, including one with the "Manxman" in situ, were published in Berlin in 1898 in a portfolio of plates entitled M6obel und Zimmereinrichtungen der Gegenwart. An interior view of the sitting room, published by Baillie Scott in 1899, shows a conven- tional upright piano; the "Manxman" piano is included only as a colored drawing: see Baillie Scott, "Decoration and Furniture for the New Palace, Darmstadt" (note 36), pp. iii and 113. 41. Three months later, on May 14, 1902, this piano (number 95399), identified as being designed by M. H. B. Scott Esq., was packed for shipment, along with piano number 95406 designed by C. R. Ashbee, and sent to "The Director of the National Museum of Dec- orative Art, Budapest, Hungary" for show at the International Exhi- bition held from September to November 19o2 in that city. They were returned on January 31, 1903, as "damaged." Later that year, on November 17, 1903, Baillie Scott's piano, described as being "black and purple," was taken on hire to London for exhibition at the Woodberry Gallery, 37 New Bond Street, for a period of less than two months. The piano was apparently unsold until October 20, 90io, when Broadwood records indicate that piano no. 95399, identified (incorrectly) as an "Ashbee" design, was sold for ?42 less io%, along with another upright, to J. C. Sherwin and Son, Market Square, Hanley, Staffs. The Victoria and Albert's piano still bears a metal label for "J. C. Sherwin &amp; Sons, Hanley, Est. I855." 42.

In offering a highly abbreviated description of the relationship between the Kamakura government and Zen, it is difficult "to elude the trap set by storytellers of the heroic" (Jeffery P. Mass, Antiquity and Anachronism in Japanese History [Stanford, Calif., 1992], p. 18). In fact, elements of the Kyoto aristocracy displayed a genuine interest in the spiritual aspects of Zen and, because the aristocracy did not want to be politically outflanked by the sho- gun, it offered patronage to Zen monks. This process of co-opting combined with the government's close monitoring of Zen at least seemed to prevent Zen monasteries from amassing military forces, a pattern seen in other sects.

Like the Art Institute's work, these images present the patriarch in bust portraits with head and hands. Other features of these paintings bear a great similarity to the Art Institute's Daruma.

One of the earliest works of this style known in Japan is the thirteenth-century painting signed by the painter known as Ganki or Shugetsu. He seems to have been Chinese. The painting is inscribed by the Japanese monk Muzo Seisho (1234-1306); see entry 2 in Bodhidharma (Tokyo, 1988). 6. The general terms of this portrait suggest the work of a provincial professional artist rather than a monk painter. For example, Hasegawa T-ohaku (1539-1610), who later became a central figure in the artistic ferment of Momoyama-period Kyoto, executed Buddhist iconography, including portraits of Zen masters, while he still resided in western Japan. His well-known portrait of the warlord Takeda Shingen (1521-1573) reveals a similar juxtaposition of tex- tile detail and dominating visage. See Nakajima Junshi, Hasegawa T6haku, in Nihon Bijutsu Kaiga Senshu (Tokyo, 1979), vol. 25. 7.

Sakoku, meaning "national isolation," was a gradually evolved policy that actually began with edicts issued against foreigners, particularly missionaries, in the late sixteenth century. These edicts were unevenly enforced over a period of nearly forty years. In 1635, however, Japanese people were forbidden from leaving Japan and, in 1639, foreigners, with the exception of Dutch and Chinese traders, were forbidden entry. 13. Christine M. E.

The provenance of the so-called Garland set has interesting Chicago connections. The set was known to have been owned by the Spaulding family, whose collection now forms a major portion of Japanese print collection in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The Spauldings met Frank Lloyd Wright in January 1913, some eight months before the death of Chicago businessman Clarence Buckingham. Records suggest that about three hundred prints were sold by Wright to Buckingham, the majority of which were works by Hiroshige. In September of that year, the Spauldings inquired through Wright about the disposition of the Buckingham collec- tion following Buckingham's death. In the ensuing eight years, the Spauldings arranged for Wright to be a principal supplier of prints to them. It is unclear whether or not the Chie no umi series was purchased through Wright. In any case, the Spauldings apparently sold the set to Frederick Gookin, the first keeper of the Buckingham Collection at the Art Institute. It is assumed that Gookin acquired these for his personal collection. Eventually, the series passed to the Garland collection.

Ainsworth Collection, exh. cat. (Oberlin, Ohio, 1984), p. 42.

Matthi Forrer, Hokusai (London, I991). See discussion of nos. 47 and 49. 21. Keyes (note 19), p. 90o. Keyes offered a very satisfactory defini- tion of surimono: "Meaning literally 'a printed object,' it was later used to describe certain kinds of private publications rather than commercially published woodblock prints. Originally the word was applied to prints published by members of poetry groups for private distribution; gradually it was used to describe prints which were used to announce or commemorate certain events, like musi- cal performances. What these prints shared, besides their circum- stances of private publication, was an important printed text." 22. The author is indebted to Sebastian Izzard of Christie's, New York, for this observation and for other information concerning the 1983 sale. 23.

Hokusai's fame in the West was secure before his death and, remarkably, even before the Meiji Restoration (i868) and Japan's reopening to the outside world. His fame was owed in part to the accolades of Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796-I866), a Bavarian physician, naturalist, and ethnographer employed by the Dutch at their trading station in Nagasaki. In a carefully supervised visit to Edo in 1826, Siebold may have met Hokusai, or at least had indirect communication with him. A series of paintings attributed to Hokusai that is now in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden, 20o6 NOTES FOR PAGES 179-185</page><page sequence="19">was commissioned by Siebold. These paintings were executed on Dutch paper, and display an understanding of Western techniques of perspective, modeling, and chiaroscuro. Hokusai's fascination with Western representational techniques, however, certainly pre- ceded his possible encounter with Siebold. It is instructive to view these paintings in terms of the dramatic compositions and odd palettes found in some of the prints in the Chie no umi series. See Willem van Gulik, "Fifteen Paintings by Hokusai in the Von Siebold Collection," in Philipp Franz von Siebold's Ukiyo-e Collection: An Introduction (New York, 1978), pp. 35-47; and Philipp Franz von Siebold's Ukiyo-e Collection (Tokyo, 1978), vol. 3, pp. 8-37. TRAVIS, "Paul Strand's Fall in Movement," pp. 186-195. This essay is written in honor of James N. Wood, who appreciated Strand's garden photographs while director of the St. Louis Museum of Art, and who on coming to The Art Institute of Chi- cago as director in 1980 made it possible to purchase many magnif- icent Strand photographs for the permanent collection. Since 1980, the Art Institute has acquired thirty-six photographs by Paul Strand. Twelve purchases were made through the Ada Turnbull Hertle Fund. Gifts were received from Helen Harvey Mills, Walter Rosenblum, and the Paul Strand Foundation. The print of Fall in Movement was made by Richard Benson after Strand's death. Before Strand died, Benson had made a master set of the prints in Portfolio Three and Portfolio Four that Strand approved. These then became the guide prints for the completion of the portfolios. My appreciation of Strand's work and career has been helped by Walter and Naomi Rosenblum, Michael E. Hoffman, Sarah Greenough, and Kaspar M. Fleischmann. I am also grateful for the assistance of Sylvia Wolf, Colin Westerbeck, Anthony Montoya, Catherine Duncan, and Lori Singer in the preparation of the manuscript. i. A group of Strand garden photographs were shown after his death at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in an exhibition orga- nized by Michael E. Hoffman entitled "Paul Strand, Discoveries: The Early Years 1915-i916; and Garden Images, 1956-1974"; the exhi- bition ran from November 12, 1978, to June 30, 1979. In November 1992, an exhibition selected exclusively of Strand's Orgeval garden photographs was presented at the Virginia Zabriskie Gallery, Paris. This exhibition was accompanied by an illustrated booklet with an introduction by Catherine Duncan. 2. In 1926, Strand took a vacation to Colorado, where he took at least one natural still life that he included in comprehensive retro- spectives of his work. 3.

Strand is described as "remote and austere" in Naomi Rosenblum, Orgeval: A Remembrance of Paul Strand (New York, 1990), p. 7. The "doggedness and suspension with which [Strand] protects himself against conditions" is a character description from a letter from Gaston Lachaise to Alfred Stieglitz, quoted in Naomi Rosenblum, "Paul Strand: The Early Years, 1910-1932" (Ph.D. diss., City University of New York, 1978), p. 154. 6. Strand's early street portraits were taken with a lens on which was mounted a right-angle mirror or prism allowing him to photo- graph ninety degrees from where the camera was pointed. He had tried mounting a fake lens on the body of a Graflex camera, but it was discovered by his subjects. 7. Basil Davidson described the Orgeval garden as "admirably wild" in "Working with Strand," in Maren Stange, ed., Paul Strand: Essays on his Life and Work (Millerton, N.Y., 1990), p. 217. 8. Catherine Duncan has provided a full description of the Orgeval garden in "The Years in Orgeval," in Stange (note 7), pp. 231-38, and in "Paul Strand: The Garden: Vines and Leaves," Aperture 78 (0977), PP. 46-48. 9. Strand's book on France was entitled La France de profil with a text in French by Claude Roy. It was published in Lausanne by La Guilde du Livre in 1952. Strand's book on the village of Luzzara, Italy, was entitled Un paese with a text in Italian by Cesare Zavattini. It was published by in Turin by Giulo Einaudi in 1955. io. The title The Apple That Fell, The Garden of Eden (0973) is written on the verso of an original print in Paul Strand's hand. The other title is written in Hazel Strand's hand. As no other prints with metaphorical titles are in Strand's own hand, one may ques- tion whether these titles were his own. It is unlikely that after sixty years of resisting them others would take it upon themselves to assign them without his permission. Catherine Duncan, who worked with the Strands on the garden photographs, remembers that, because Paul was not able to write, the titles he created for his last works had to be recorded by Hazel. I1. Another print of The Great Vine in Death (1973) bears the title The Great Vine Alive in Death and is dated 1972. 12. See Catherine Duncan, "The Years in Orgeval," in Stange (note 7), PP. 236-38. 13. Michael E. Hoffman remembers this to be the working title of Strand's book of garden photographs. 14. Catherine Duncan proposes this idea of an open future in "The Years in Orgeval," in Stange (note 7), p. 238. 15.
