<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel. By Benjamin D. Sommer. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009. Pp. xv + 334. $85. Traditional Jewish belief expressed in liturgy and philosophical writing posits that God has no form or body. God is incorporeal and any anthropomorphic depiction is metaphorical. In this new book, Benjamin Sommer disputes this belief, claiming that from the Bible until the present most Israelites, Judeans, and Jews have believed that God has a body and denial of such is a minority view (cf. Mai monides). Furthermore, most sources reflecting Israelite religious intuition assume God has more than one body. But all God's bodies are essentially a single body, for God's body is fluid and when He is embodied in one place He remains embodied in other places simultaneously without one body dimin ishing the other. In the introduction Sommer defines "body" as "something located in a particular place at a particu lar time, whatever its shape or substance" (p. 2), and identifies many biblical passages (mainly Penta teuchal) locating God in a specific place at a specific time. Because God's presence in one place does not negate or diminish His simultaneous presence elsewhere His body must be "fluid." Chapter one examines ancient Near Eastern concepts of divine fluidity including 1) "fragmenta tion," by which a particular god bearing a specific name and personality was at one and the same time</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 675 one god and several gods (Ishtar of Arbela and Ishtar of Nineveh were both Ishtar, etc.); 2) overlapping identities of several deities (Ninurta's body or Marduk's attributes were identified with various, distinct gods; Eniima elis identifies Marduk with Ellil and Ea); 3) individual gods embodied simultaneously in various corporeal manifestations (Shamash was the heavenly solar disc, but also the cult statue standing in his temple(s) in Sippar or Larsa). Similar beliefs occurred in West Semitic religions. Baal (Hadad) "fragmentized" into local, indi vidually worshipped be&lt;alim. Other gods were identified with him by being given the appellative sem-Ba'al or pan-Ba(al (Phoenician Tanit pan-Bacal: Ugaritic Athrat pan-Ba'al). These gods enjoyed multiple corporeal embodiments without diminishing the god in heaven or on Mt. Zaphon. Stone pillars (byt'l, skn, sikkanum, selem) embodied divinities without diminishing the heavenly body. Chapter two discusses divine fluidity in ancient Israel. Fragmentation is evidenced by YHWH Teman and YHWH-Shomron at Kuntillet Ajrud. YHWH's angels resemble the avatars of Hinduism. They are not independent messengers from the heavenly retinue but independently functioning parts of YHWH. YHWH was embodied in wood or stone. YHWH's Asherah at Kuntillet Ajrud was not His con sort goddess but His arboreal embodiment. The goddess Asherah (cf. 1 Kings 18:19) became a part of YHWH just as the Phoenician goddess Tanit was sem-Ba'al, and Asherah embodied as a tree was essentially a tree-like embodiment of YHWH. YHWH was also embodied as a stone massebah. Jacob anointed a massebah, turning it into a place where YHWH was present, just as the Mesopotamian Mouth Washing rite turned the statue into a god. In the Northern Kingdom YHWH was worshipped in the form of gillulim (stone idols), massekot (molten images), golden calves (2 Kings 17:12, 15-16), and perhaps an altar or Ephod. In Gen. 31:11-13 an angel says "I am ha'el bet'el where you anointed a massebah," with YHWH calling Himself ha'el while He is both an angel and a massebah. Chapter three examines Pentateuchal sources rejecting YHWH's fluidity. In general, YWHW's name is His appellative and He Himself, so it can be YHWH's hypostasis or emanation and found anywhere. YHWH's Kabdd is both His fame and a tangible attribute indicating but not exhausting His presence (sekinah in Rabbinic parlance). However, in Deuteronomic (D) and the Deuteronomistic (Dtr) writings YHWH's name is just a name. Placing it on the temple indicates divine presence, ownership, or attention without embodying YHWH. YHWH's body is in heaven whence He looks down, but it does not descend. There is nothing in the temple apart from His name. YHWH's body is not fluid so that He cannot be incorporated in icons, pillars, and Asherot, and he can be worshipped in only one place lest one think that He is fluid or multiple. Negating divine fluidity leads to cult centralization. The pronouncement "Hear O Israel, YHWH is our God, YHWH is one" (Deut. 6:4) expresses YHWH's unity, declaring that He is not fluid and is indivisible. Priestly writings (P, H, Ezekiel) reject divine fluidity but in opposite ways. For them, God has an anthropomorphic body and Man is its likeness. YHWH's body and the radiant effulgence enveloping it are called Kabod. YHWH's Kabod descended from heaven at Sinai and entered the Tabernacle. YHWH's body is not material and the Priestly conception should be characterized as "non-material anthropomorphism." God is not so large that the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him (cf. 1 Kings 8:27; Dtr), but the size of His Kabod varies. It covers Mount Sinai, but to reside among His people God can condense it and reside in the tiny Holy of Holies. After entering the Tabernacle, God departs only to travel from place to place. YHWH appears in the Tabernacle but not outside and never returns to Mount Sinai or heaven (but cf. Ezek. 8-12, where YHWH abandons the temple). Chapter four examines the relationship between the concepts of the divine bodies and parallel concepts of holy places, because the latter are derived from the former. Source E's Tent of Meeting Cohel md'ed) stood outside the camp, and a person seeking God would go out there. A pillar of cloud would descend upon the entry to the tent and YHWH would speak to the person inside. Source P's Tabernacle-Tent of Meeting (miskan 'dhel md'ed) stood at the center of the camp with YHWH's Kabod permanently within. Its erection was the culmination of creation, and from within God would call to Moses to speak with Him. These two opposing views coincide with religious ideologies described by J. Z. Smith as locative-centripetal and utopian-centrifugal. For Sommer, P's view was locative while</page><page sequence="3">676 Journal of the American Oriental Society 130.4 (2010) E's was Utopian. P distinguishes sharply between center and periphery, with the one, indivisible divine body always being at the center, while E considered every place as a potential center on the condition that the divine body could be found there, and this possibility exists when the divine body is fluid. The locative ideology was preceded by "Zion Theology" (term coined by Tryggve Mettinger), which connected YHWH to the Ark first located at Shiloh and afterwards at the heart of the Land of Israel in Jerusalem, where it was supposed to remain permanently. But Priestly theology differed from Zion-YHWH Sebaot theology in that the center was mobile. Sommer calls this concept "locomotive," and it is essentially a compromise between the locative and the Utopian approaches because YHWH is always found in the center but the center moves. The com promise is expressed by the Priestly double designation miskan 'ohel md'ed. The doubling is expressed in the architecture which combines (Solomon's) temple with tent. D and Dtr disagreed. For them YHWH never descended from heaven, there was no Tent as focus of divine presence, and the temple was not a house in which He was found. D's Ark was only a tablet box. Jerusalem was a chosen, sacred city but not a place of divine residence, for YHWH resided in heaven. Chapter five concentrates on stories about the origin of the sanctity of the holy places and these stories' attitudes towards divine presence. For P the pinnacle of cosmic history was the days of initiat ing the Tabernacle, after which YHWH entered the Tabernacle. Completing the Tabernacle brought creation to fruition as history started anew. These days should have been joyous but concluded in the catastrophic deaths of Nadav and Abihu. But why? To answer this question Sommer examines tales of origins in J/E. Every such story contains an element of expulsion or exileâ€”Adam and Eve from the Garden, Abram from his homeland, Moses from Egypt to Midian. Expulsion and exile undermine the concept of a center, because following the expulsion the center becomes the periphery, and vice versa. Sommer suggests that this plasticity in relationship to center and periphery occurs in the Taber nacle initiation also. The Garden of Eden was a divine locality but not a natural habitat for Man, who must be driven out. Similarly, the Tabernacle was a place for divine presence but unsuited for people, including priests, so they must be killed. Ironically, the Tabernacle is not even suited to YHWH, for He must shrink Himself in order to fit, and shrinking entails danger. In the end, God erupts and harms the priests. Combining the locomotive nature of divine presence in the Tabernacle (the mobile center) with the disaster which occurred on the day of its initiation shows that, for P, YHWH is in exile at the very time He resides in the Tabernacle because His natural place is heaven. Chapter six traces fluidity and non-fluidity traditions in Judaism and Christianity. The anti-fluidity traditions of P, D, Dtr shaped the Bible as received. Nonetheless, the fluidity tradition was not entirely expunged and can be discerned even when enveloped by anti-fluidity traditions. P's radiant Kabod in the Tabernacle became the Sages' sekinah with its radiance (ziw) and was found in specific Jocales. Contrasting texts mention sekinah found simultaneously in several places. YHWH's sekinah speaks with YHWH, showing that sekinah is both YHWH and distinct from Him. The same is true of YHWH's memra' in Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel. The fluidity tradition waxes stronger in Kabbalistic literature. Some Kabbalists view the Sefirot as entities distinct from YHWH; others see them as integral parts of the Godhead. In some texts individual Sefirot interact as if separate entities, but they are considered simultaneously part of the divine unity. In Lurianic Kabbala, God's body fragmented into smaller embodiments at the moment of creation, so God who continues existing in heaven is also found at specific localities on earth. In Sommer's opinion Judaism reverts in Kabbala to the pre-Deuteronomic faith in which the fluid divine body was embodied in pillars, trees, and icons. The fluidity traditions of the Bible and ancient Near East continue in the Christian Trinity, as seen in Christian interpretation of Gen. 18 (Abraham and the three angels). As for anti-fluidity traditions, Prot estantism follows D because the church is not considered God's house, while Catholicism continues P, but in its conception of the Eucharist it follows E and the fluidity tradition. The fact that Christianity in its various confessions contains authentic, entrenched biblical traditions Sommer regards as a biblical warrant for some Christian beliefs. Specifically, the belief that God has an earthly body and a heavenly embodiment is an authentic, perfectly "kosher" Jewish belief! On the other hand, Christianity's rejec tion of P because of its legalism is not justified because just as Christianity facilitates divine-human contact by embodying God in a human body (Jesus the son) so P facilitates God's approach to the</page><page sequence="4">Reviews of Books 677 world by building the Tabernacle, the place of his Kabod. (I disagree for the same reason that I reject comparison of the Tabernacle to the cult statue; see below.) Divine fluidity might appear polytheistic because God is found in multiple places. But for Sommer it is the Bible's most monotheistic concept and enables all sorts of desirable God-man relationships. Fluidity permits God to be everywhere and interact with man without spatial limitations. The number of divine bodies is potentially infinite, allowing God to change, approach man, and search him out. A fluid divine body is divisible but divisibility does not diminish his size and presence everywhere because it is infinite. God's fluid body is unlike any other body and is unfathomable, but it is approach able and man can have dialogue with Him. Ultimately the fluidity model replaces a God actively found everywhere at all times with a God who potentially can be embodied everywhere and at any time, the result of the two being omnipresence! A concluding appendix discusses monotheism and polytheism in ancient Israel and the Bible. Som mer defines monotheism "broadly" as belief in the existence of several gods but worship of a single god who possesses all authority, even though minor gods and heavenly beings who obey Him can be approached as intercessors before Him. The Bible describes the Israelites as polytheists but ancient Israelite religion as revealed in archaeology and epigraphy was really monotheistic. The ancient Israel ite onomasticon contains no overtly idolatrous names, and the iconography provides no representations of any gods apart from YWHW (represented by a winged disk). Only the Ta'anach cult stand may attest worship of Asherah along with YHWH. This may imply that early on she was worshipped as well (Sommer rejects identifying Asherah at Kuntilet Ajrud with a goddess). As for the Bible itself, Sommer finds in it monotheistic-monolatry, i.e., belief in several deities but ascription of all essential power to YHWH alone. The Bible mentions several gods, beney 'elim, l/'ney &gt;eldhim, qeddsim, YHWH's heavenly retinue, etc., but all these divinities obey YHWH, have no inde pendent power, do not act on their own, do not rebel against YHWH, and don't compete with Him. They are gods in name only, for to all intents and purposes they are impotent and non-existent. In contrast to all other ancient Near Eastern religions, only YHWH is sole creator and absolute ruler of the universe. The book leaves several questions for further consideration: 1) Sommer defines "body" as "something located in a particular place at a particular time, whatever its shape or substance." A body can therefore be abstract, lacking substance and form. Such a body can enter an anthropomorphic icon, be assimilated and take on the properties and form of the icon and be indistinguishable from the icon. However, when it enters a stone pillar it will not be assimilated by the stone but will remain abstract and amorphous and still without material. Contra Sommer, the stone will remain the god's dwelling place and nothing more without turning into the body of the god. Sommer compares erecting the Tabernacle and the entry of the Kabdd to the Mesopotamian Mouth Washing ritual which introduces the god to the divine statue (p. 74). In my opinion this comparison is farfetched because the Mesopotamian ritual turns the statue into the living god, while the Tabernacle is never more than a container and never turns into God Himself. There is a precedent for Sommer's conten tion in Mesopotamian temples, which according to their Sumerian ceremonial names were identified with the resident gods (so Thorkild Jacobsen), but Sommer has not raised this possibility and to me it seems unlikely. 2) Sommer explains Asherah at Kuntilet Ajrud as a cultic implement, specifically an embodiment of YHWH Himself. But he did not consider R. S. Hess's thesis (adopted recently by Nadav Naaman) that'srth is not "his Asherah" but the divine name Asheratah. If Hess is right there is no reason not to regard 'srth of Ajrud as a goddess. If they are wrong, then in my opinion 'srt(h) is to be understood as a holy site or temple (cf. Akkadian esirtu) on the basis of Akkadian blessing formulae which invoke a god and his temple. 3) Sommer interprets the twelve pillars and twelve stones erected by Moses (Exod. 24:4) and Joshua (Josh. 4:20) as embodiments of YHWH (p. 31). He has gotten carried away on these points, and it is preferable to view these stones as symbolic embodiments of the twelve tribes, comparable to Mesopo tamian statues of humans, placed in the temples before the gods to represent the supplicant in perpetual prayer. A parallel closer to home would be the pillars from Hazor upon which are engraved human hands (raised in prayer).</page><page sequence="5">678 Journal of the American Oriental Society 130.4 (2010) 4) Sommer suggests that in many senses, in Kabbala, Judaism reverts to pre-Deuteronomic stages of development (p. 132). Surprisingly he overlooks Simo Parpola ("The Assyrian Tree of Life: Tracing the Origins of Jewish Monotheism and Greek Philosophy," JNES 52 [1993]: 161-208), who regards the Assyrian sacred tree as the roots of the Sefirotic tree of the Kabbala which, according to Sommer, is the prime example of fragmentation of the divine body and the fluidity model. 5) In discussing YHWH's physical representations, Sommer ignores YWHH's embodiment as a(n anthropomorphic) cult-statue in Michayahu's temple (Judg. 18:30) and doesn't discuss suggestions that a YHWH cult statue even stood in Jerusalem. 6) In the appendix on monotheism Sommer claims that YHWH has no heavenly opponents and this indicates YHWH's exclusive supremacy, in contrast to Enuma elis or the Baal epic in which the chief god is challenged by rivals. But he overlooks Helel (Lucifer), son of Shahar (Isa. 14:12-14), who rebels against YHWH. 7) The book deals only with corporeality, i.e., God's material embodiment in physical objects, but offers no systematic discussion of anthropomorphism, God in human form. The Bible is rife with anthropomorphic descriptions of God, often mentioning His limbs and organs. God is described in human roles (warrior, king, shepherd, judge), wearing or wielding suitable costume and appurtenances. It would have been appropriate to allude to the connection between these descriptions and the divine bodies which were described. More specifically, to what extent and in what manner is God incarnate in such bodies? When are depictions of God as a warrior riding a cloud, flashing lightning, thundering, and causing earthquakes visible manifestations to be considered incorporations of YHWH and His body? Are God's eye's and heart (Deut. 11:12; 1 Kings 8:28; 9:10) or mouth and hand (1 Kings 8:24) mere metaphors for divine providence or are they descriptions of YHWH's body and an indication that the Deuteronomistic school considers God's body to be of human form and not abstract (see p. 64 on the basis of Deut. 4:15-16)? In chapter six, Sommer metamorphosizes from biblical scholar to Jewish theologian. At this point he no longer writes as a detached reader of ancient sources but as a religious Jew seeking guidance from the Hebrew Bible in shaping his personal beliefs. As a theologian and educator Sommer asks which aspects of God can be viewed by contemporary Jews with the assistance of the fluidity tradition. On the one hand, embodying God helps Jews appreciate the importance of performing commandments, in particular the Sabbath, by the observance of which Man imitates God, the creator. On the other hand, emphasizing the divine body and its presence in specific places entails recognition of sacred space, holy places, and the Holy Land. But God's bond to such places is not unseverable, because God can aban don them, meaning that the sanctity of a site (including the Temple Mount) is a transient or potential sanctity without always being active sanctity. The shift from detached, "objective," philological, and historical inquiry to theology and even to sermonizing is commonplace among Christian Bible scholars but much rarer among Jews, who tend to draw a line between biblical scholarship and Judaism in practice, and Jewish theology is usually derived from Rabbinic sources. Sommer declares himself a believing Jew, but readily adapts critical biblical scholarship, and its results and conclusions actually guide his faith. By frequently using the terms "sensitivity" and "intuition," Sommer discloses his belief that the Bible is an expression not of revelation originating with God but rather of the human religious sensitivity of the People of Israel (just as foreign sources express Gentile religious sensitivity). Another hallmark of the volume (and especial ly the final chapter) is Sommer's conviction that religious innovation does not annul previous beliefs and that there is no need for harmonization in reaching theological and religious conclusions. This book certainly will resonate positively amongst the adherents of Abraham Joshua Heschel, Yochanan Muffs, Mordechai Kaplan, and Martin Buber. In conclusion, Benjamin Sommer's study of God's bodies contributes significantly to our under standing of biblical religion as an exemplary comparative study, encompassing various periods and disciplines not usually studied together. Sommer is a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the rabbinic school of Juda ism's Conservative Movement. It is therefore likely that this book reflects the biblical theology with which Conservative rabbinical students will be inculcated, and the concept of God it presents will not</page><page sequence="6">Reviews of Books 679 be confined to academia but will influence the spiritual world of many Jews in America and elsewhere. No doubt some will take issue with this or that point or with the entire book, but there is also no doubt that the volume will interest and enlighten professional scholars, theologians, and lay readers wishing to know God.
