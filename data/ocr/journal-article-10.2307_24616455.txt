The Book of Sindibad and The City of the Sun I shall begin by telling a story. There was once a king called Ciro who had seven wives but no sons. When finally the heir arrived, the king was above all anxious to assure him a good education. He sent him to school, but after three years his son still knew nothing. So the king sent for a wise man, Syntipas (or Sindibad), who was a philosopher. Within six months, Sindibad promised the king, his son would be the wisest man in the world. "If I fail in this undertaking, you should kill me." The story tells how Sindibad succeeded in his quest. "And so Sindibad, once he had taken the king's son from his father's hands, led him to his own house. First of all, he built for him a spa cious home with an ornate interior, which he had plastered in shining white. Then on the walls he painted all the things that the young prince needed to know. He said to the prince: 'You are going to pass all your days in here, within these walls, until you have learnt everything that I have painted on them'. From that moment, the philosopher sat down close to the boy, and living constantly with him, explained to him the meaning of all those paintings." After six months, "the boy had acquired more knowledge than anyone else had been able to attain."1 At this point of the story, things get more complicated because, by gazing at the stars, the master discovers that the boy is in danger of death and will be able to save himself only by staying silent for seven whole days. But the part of the story that interests us here is the teaching method adopted by the master. "He followed my progress in just the right way," the prince would later tell the king, "taking only small steps at a time."2 This means that the philosopher had respected the natural rhythms of the boy's progress, using a method opposed to that of the schools (which had in fact failed in their task). That is to say, the philosopher had used a method in harmony with nature, pleasing and gradual, of which the essential components were the use of images, the order of presentation, and the play of multiple references between images and words, which could be either words dictated by the master or words written into the images themselves as illustration or explanation. The master, as the young prince would remark later, had painted onto the walls all that he wanted to teach him: "illustrating the content with writings, and displaying both in an accurate order that included the Sun, the moon and the stars."3 This story is part of a text written by an anonymous Persian author between the seventh and the ninth centuries. It has been cited here in a Byzantine translation from the end of the eleventh century entitled 11 libro di Sindibad (The Book of Sindibad), which was only one of many translations of this This text was first published as "Le città utopiche del cinquecento italiano: giochi di spazio e di saperi," L'asino d'oro 4.7 (1993) 64-81.

Its fortune and diffusion were extraordinary, both in the East, where part of it was integrated into the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, and in the West, where it was known from at least the twelfth century onward and circulated under many titles, of which the best known was II lihro dei sette savi {The Book of the Seven Wise Men). What seems not to have been previously noted, as far as I know, is that this story, with which the book opens, presents several points of similarity with Thomas Cam panella's La città del sole (The City of the Sun). There an encyclopedic education is also presented in simple and rapid terms, combining the use of images with that of words. The circular temple placed on the summit of the hill, right in the center of Campanula's Utopian city, is adorned with a cupola on which the major constellations are painted: "with their names noted, and the virtues they exercise over terrestrial things, all in three verses for each constellation." Seven circles of walls surround the city ("all of them of huge dimensions, and named according to the seven planets"). On these walls, all the arts and sciences are illustrated in painted images with written explanations. There, writes Campanella, "everything which it is necessary to know is painted, and the paintings are explained in words." He adds that "the masters of these things go there, and find their pupils playing, with no constriction. In that way they learn the history of all knowledge before they are ten years old."4 In The Book of Sindibad the sevenfold structure is also considered of great importance. The education of the prince takes six months and is then made public in the seventh month, when he triumphs over his enemies. Similarly, in The City of the Sun, the pupil is educated by proceeding physically around six circles of walls, culminating in the seventh and final circle, which contains the central temple decorated with the astral images. The Orient, we might add, is one of the topi cal spaces of wisdom in the Western imagination. The language attributed by Thomas More to his Utopians is Persian, and it is again in the Orient that the inhabitants of the City of the Sun are placed.5 "These people originate from the Indies," the Genovese explains to the Ospitalario. "Many of them were philosophers who fled from the ruins of Mogori and from other oppressors and tyrants. For that reason they decided to live philosophically in a community." Further on, they will be described as "Pythagorean Brahmins."6 It is from the Orient that The Book of Sindibad (or The Book of the Seven Wise Men) also derives. A long tradition that lasted well into the nineteenth century considered it as deriving specifically from India. The part of The City of the Sun that we have been examining here, dedicated to the images painted on the city walls and their pedagogical function, was destined to find a remarkable reception in the context of pedagogical thought and Utopian values in Europe. It acted as an important influ ence on the experimental thought of Comenius, for example. Modern scholars have also dedicated considerable attention to it, emphasizing how it should be seen as an example of Campanella's educational ideal, deriving from the ideal of the humanists. It has been linked to the tradition of the Art of Memory, of which it can be seen as a simplified example, with important democratic implica tions. It has also been considered as a project of the avant-garde or as a kind of open-air museum to be used by the general public.7 The textual link with The Book of the Seven Wise Men that we have proposed here thus adds a number of new dimensions to a web of relationships and meanings already rich in their complexity. At the same time, it calls our attention to the theme proposed in this essay: and that is, the close link between Utopian spaces and the concept of the encyclopedia. To put it another way, the writing of Utopian texts was also, at least in many cases, a way of reordering the map of knowledge, and thus of redesigning the encyclopedia in terms of urban space. 4 Campanella 1941,58, 56, 60, 61.

Utopias: Games of Space and Knowledge There are some aspects of the relationships we have been discussing that must remain in the back ground here. For example, we will not be concerned with the fact that—as the texts of both More and Campanella clearly demonstrate—the "alternative" space of Utopias permits the representation, in detached but authoritative terms, of an ideal form of knowledge, a network of beliefs and values that are attributed explicitly to the inhabitants of that particular "world that nowhere exists." Another aspect of Utopian texts that will not be emphasized here, although it has been acutely noticed, if in differing terms, both by Baczko and by Klein, is the physical description of the Uto pian city. These descriptions, according to Baczko, are inspired by a principle of transparency: "the alternative society is precisely one that dissimulates none of its mechanisms and means of functioning, differently from the opaque nature of all societies so far known." What the Utopian city demonstrates, we might add, is a meaningful image of the principles that inspire it, a visible representation of the alternative forms of knowledge from which it is born and which give it form.8 Robert Klein has underlined the cosmic symbolism that characterizes many Utopian cities of the Renaissance, conferring on the image of the Utopian city the image that the author has of the cosmos. Klein has also demonstrated the strict link between urban planning and the Utopian city. In both cases, the design of the city leads to the production of an image that gives material form to its social structure, either by making evident or by modifying the data. In either case, he argues, the authors accept the postulate that men can be changed by organizing the space in which they move. On the other hand, the image of the Utopian city is, again according to Klein, an image projected by the "ego," a kind of mandala through which the author gives harmonious form to his dreams and unsatisfied desires. It is possible, according to Klein, that Campanella, by transforming his imaginary republic into the plastic vision of the City of the Sun, realized within himself the beneficial influence that the space of this city is presumed to exercise on all its inhabitants.9 By concentrat ing his attention on models of the city, Klein came to recognize that Utopian images serve a similar function to the one underlined by Baczko, who proposes the study of Utopian texts as a component of the social imagination. Such Utopian images, according to Baczko, offer receptive structures to collective hopes in their search for a moral and social ideal, and thus they become active agents that contribute to the crystallization of widespread dreams.10 The problem that inspires the inquiry pursued in this essay is of more modest and specific dimensions. It concerns the idea that the structure of some sixteenth-century Utopian texts is such that the space and order of the text itself comes to resemble the space and order of a new encyclo pedia. This means that to design the new city implies designing new forms of knowledge, making the writing of the Utopian text into a "serious" form of intellectual game. The image of a "game" has been used by both Baczko and Louis Marin in reference to the founding text of the modern Utopian tradition-—that is, Thomas Mores Utopia. Baczko looks at the interplay of texts and images (including the Utopian alphabet) that animates Mores text in its various editions, between 1516 and 1518: More, Pietro Gilles, Erasmus, and Budé, Baczko writes, all play at making Utopias, according to the rules of "serious game-playing" (serio ludere). It is an erudite game, as well as a poetic one. It also presupposes a coexistence, or rather a unity, of knowledge and the imagination. The dramatic problems of real life are far from being absent, but 8 See Baczko 1981, 880 and Baczko 1978. 9 See Klein 1970 but also Marconi et al. 1973 andSciolla 1975. 'SeeBaczko 1981, 869.</page><page sequence="4">34 LINA BOLZONI they appear through the filter of the game, whose space is completely artificial and coincides with the writing of the text itself. According to the sestina added by Pietro Gilles to the 1518 edition of the Utopia, such a space is to be found between the world that does not exist and the best of all possible worlds. Such a ludicrously paradoxical dimension, we might want to observe, will later on be fully explored, almost as if sleepwalking, by Doni, well known as the editor of the first Italian translation of Mores text.11 Furthermore, it is interesting to note, in this playful context, a game described in Girolamo Bargagli's Dialogo de' giuochi che nelle vegghie sanesi si usano di fare (1572; A Dialogue on the Games Played during the Evenings in Siena), called a "gioco dell'usanza" (a game about customs), "in which the players pretend that it is in their power to reform the world, and each one of them describes the good customs they would like to introduce and the bad ones they would like to eliminate." It is referred to as an example of those games that derive from the topi cal category of "transmutation": that is, they start out from real things only to finish up by adding to, masquerading, or transforming reality.12 By the end of the sixteenth century, then, people were playing the game of creating Utopias, so much so that the game could be described and catalogued according to a precise and reassuring rhetorical pattern. Furthermore, this game was seen as an integral part of the life of the private academies that Bargagli is describing, taking advantage of a long tradition of literary and cultural memories that themselves conditioned and provided the oc casion of the game itself. In a sense, then, this is the point of arrival and the moment of exhaustion of a tradition that started with Mores Utopia. Games, or more specifically "jeux d'espace" (games about space), are mentioned by Marin in a perspective that connects the ideas of Derrida and Lyotard to the implications deriving from the ancient concept of the logic or rhetoric of topics. For Marin, the Utopian topic is a game concern ing space in the sense that it creates a neutral space that cannot be identified either with the old or with the new world, with truth or with falsity. It expresses a criticism that is never an end in itself but rather provides a glimpse of "the other" within both space and time. The Utopian discourse is constructed as a topic insofar as "it constitutes a multiple space constituted in discursive terms, in terms of topoi whose dispersion and plurality obey specific processes and determined forms of creation" (constitue un espace multiple et disperse en lieux discursifs, en topoi don't la dispersion et la pluralité obéissent à des processus spécifiques et à un travail determine). Utopias, in Marins opinion, rather than being concerned with ideal worlds, are more concerned with their own pos sibility of sustaining a discourse about an ideal world, that is, with creating "a total organization of a world-space as a text" (une organisation totale de l'espace-monde comme texte).13 A rich tradition of studies has also demonstrated the strong impact exercised on mental cat egories, and above all on perceptions concerning the text itself, by the advent of printing. Walter Ong, to take one example, has shown how the advent of printing accentuated what one might call the spatial dimension of texts.14 The words in printed texts are arranged in a far more methodical and systematic way than they were in the manuscript tradition, making them appear as things, as objects disposed on the space of the page. Analogously, the mental processes of knowledge, of read ing, and of the production of texts are perceived in terms of local motion, that is to say, in terms of movement or of a journey. This is the context in which the new developments in logic and rhetoric emerge, as we find them, for example, in the works of Rudolph Agricola and then in the Ramist 11 See Firpo 1977. On the subject of paradox in the Renais sance, see Colie 1966. 12Bargagli 1982, 114 and 113. 13 Marin 1988,24-25. See also the observations in Greenblatt 1980,23ff. 14 Ong 1968.</page><page sequence="5">UTOPIAN CITIES IN CINQUECENTO ITALY 35 movement. Topics become an organized map of inventive procedures, visualized and reproduced, projected in ordered sequences onto the page. It was in this intellectual climate that ancient metaphors assumed a new life, a new consistency, and a new density of meaning, as in, for example, the metaphor that represents the writing of a text in terms of a journey, the following of a path, a process of navigation. It has been justly noted that real experiences, such as the voyages of discovery of the times, deeply influenced the Utopian literature of the sixteenth century from its earliest examples. Thomas More tells us that Raphael Hathloday, the discoverer of Utopia, had been a navigator with Amerigo Vespucci. On the other hand, it may justly be asked whether the suggestions deriving from historical journeys were not being superimposed onto the mental models or metaphors mentioned above. To put it in other terms: if the new climate of the age led to the inspiration and writing of a text being perceived in terms of a journey, at the same time it may be said that one of the canonical ingredients of Utopian literature—the journey toward an unknown island—at the same time mirrors and doubles the mental model we have described above. It should be remembered that Mores Raphael may have the face and look of a sailor who has undertaken many voyages, but he is essentially a philosopher, expert in Greek and Latin, who journeys carrying books and who has left all his goods with his brother in order to see the world. "He did not travel like Palinurus," More writes, "but like Ulysses, and even more like Plato."13 It is possible to read in this light also another typical element of Utopian literature, which has been underlined by Claude-Gilbert Dubois: that is, the fact that Utopian cities are generally seen from above, with a view that takes in the whole city in panoramic terms, as shown by the illustrations that accompany the text.16 Dubois explains this point of view by underlining the absence of time and the prevailing sense of space. This phenomenon can also be explained in terms of a pervasive and ordered topical pattern that governs the pages of the text, guiding the description. In the section that follows, we shall attempt to show how precisely this pattern can be found in Utopian texts characterized by diverse types of ideal, carrying out in each case the same function: that is, of permitting the ordering of an encyclopedia in terms of the various places within the Utopian city. 3. Antonio Francesco Doni's The Wise World We shall now analyze three Utopian texts of the sixteenth century in the light of the above consider ations, beginning with the Mondo savio {The Wise World) by Anton Francesco Doni (1552-1553). This Utopian text is part of a larger work containing also Mondi celesti, terrestri et infernali . . . ('Celestial, Terrestrial and Infernal Worlds), and Mondo piccolo, grande, misto, risibile, imaginato, de' pazzi e massimo {The Small, Large, Mixed, Ridiculous, Imaginary, Foolish and Maximum World)}1 The description of the Utopian city is thus presented as a small piece of a larger mosaic that tends to shatter traditional points of view. The world of knowledge (or of madness, according to a repeated play of interchange between the two terms) is the fruit of a vision conceded from above: by Jove and Mercury, who descend to earth and dress themselves up as men. This theme of seeing things from above is loaded with meaning from the very beginning of the text of Worlds. Doni claims that the procedure followed in the text, like that followed by the Academic Pilgrims themselves, 15 More 1971, 82. 16 Dubois 1978. 17 On the various editions of Doni's work, see Ricottini Marsili Libelli 1960. For interpretations of the Worlds, see Grendler 1969; Badaloni, 1973; Masi 1988,58ff; Pissavino 1991.</page><page sequence="6">36 LINA BOLZONI is similar to that practiced by someone who welcomes a foreign guest to his country. First of all he conducts his guest to the most famous sites, then to the more secret ones, taking him finally high up on a building from which the whole city is visible below. So this text begins from the most famous things known at once to be true, then passes on to the more secret ones, and finally closes with a view by a superior intelligence that inquires into our inmost soul in its every part.18 The path of knowledge proposed in this text is thus presented with a telling image as a guided tour of a foreign city, culminating in a panoramic vision seen from above. A little further on, the theme of the vision seen from above is translated into a narrative epi sode comprising a journey undertaken by both the Vignaiuoli and the Pellegrini academics. It is of particular interest here to note that the decision to ascend into the sky is inspired by a curiosity to discover whether or not there are other worlds like ours. The Pellegrini academic called Elevato observes that most people say it is impossible to know this. Nevertheless, "there were some as curi ous as I was who said that it might be possible to find a way to climb into the skies just as a way had been found to reach the Antipodes."19 The narrative continues in a tone of bizarre literary invention, but it is nevertheless possible to discern in this part of it a group of themes that will recur later on in the works of Giordano Bruno. The discovery of America has expanded the confines of the world, upsetting at the same time the traditional image of a unique, closed cosmos.20 Later on, in the sec ond part of the Worlds, dedicated to the idea of hells (inferni), the discovery of America reappears symbolically linked to an analogous possibility of multiplying the number of spaces, beginning with those of literary invention itself. "However did you manage to find so many hells?," Dante asks Momus, "for my part I was convinced that it was not possible to go further. Our ancestors never managed to penetrate into such deep regions." "If our modern navigators had been content only to follow the paths traced by our ancestors," replies Momus, "they too would have failed to find so many new lands."21 From this point onward, Doni loses no opportunity of multiplying his infernal regions. His reader is invited to pass through "the hell of scholars, the hell of those who are unhap pily married, of prostitutes and ruffians, of rich misers and the generous poor, of soldiers and idle captains, evil doctors, lawyers, artists, usurers, ignorant poets and composers." The topic continues to dilate until it explodes, just as the confines of the known world have done. The barriers have fallen, enlarging the familiar spaces as well as emphasizing the theme of space itself, and that of possible new worlds. At the same time, the suggestions linked to plurality tend, in Doni, to amalgamate and find their expression in a sense of circularity. The image of the wheel returns with obsessive regularity in his works, indicating both the dimension of metamorpho sis, or the ultimate conservation of life, and the anguished dimension of a destiny of repetition, the impossibility of escaping imprisonment in a combinatory art that can use only a finite number of elements. The experience of printing itself helps to link the image of the wheel both to an existential experience and to one of writing: "eccoci dopo questi annaspamene di dare, di distruggere et dopo che noi habbiamo girato questo mulino un pezzo, che la ruota si ferma del nostro cervello, l'acqua ci manca, et non c'è più roba da macinare" (so here we are, after all this anxious giving and destroy ing, and after we have let this mill wheel rotate for a time, the wheel of our brain stops, we remain without water, and there is nothing more to grind). Or again: "le lettere dell'alfabeto sono un mulino che gira per tutti i libri, che noi giriamo con essi la vita nostra" (the letters of the alphabet are like lsDoni 1562,4.1 have consulted the examplar in the Biblio teca Universitaria di Pisa hallmarked H. m. 11. 29. 19 Doni 1562,7. 20 See Ricci 1990. 21 Doni 1562,244-245.</page><page sequence="7">UTOPIAN CITIES IN CINQUECENTO ITALY 37 a mill that turns around for all the books, and that we turn around joining them to our lives). On the other hand: "quale è la cosa che in questo mondo non sia fatta, rifatta, volta, rivolta, aggirata, et rigirata più volte?" (is there anything in this world that is not done, then redone, turned round, turned round once more, turned over and over time and time again?")22 It is well known that Doni's Utopian city takes the form of a circle. From the great temple that rises at its center, a hundred streets depart "tirate a linea, come fanno i raggi d'una stella" (in straight lines, like the rays of a star). The city, as he had just written, is built according to a perfect circle, as if it were a star. This reference to a celestial phenomenon is emphasized at once, and often underlined. The function of this type of model is clear: "onde chi stava nel mezzo del tempio, et si voltava tondo tondo, veniva a vedere in una sola volta tutta la città" (so that anyone standing in the middle of the temple, and who turned around in a complete circle, could see the whole city at one glance).23 The city is thus visible in its entirety. The map of its sites opens up with the maximum of clarity. One could say that its spaces correspond to a logic of nature, so that the spaces for error, for antisocial behavior, tend to be reduced to zero. Any residual exceptions can be eliminated by the pain of death. On the other hand, it is also true that in the island of Utopia there is no place in which to hide, no place for the practice of vice, given that the presence of so many eyes makes honest endeavor a necessity.24 Private space is thus viewed as potentially dangerous. The full visibility of the Utopian city can thus also become an obscure and disturbing dimension of its transparency. This narrative structure, proceeding as if along the radii of a wheel, governs Doni's Utopian city. It allows a rational disposition of the arts and crafts: "aveva la città in ogni strada due arti, come dire, da un canto tutti i sarti, dall'altro tutte le botteghe di panno. Un'altra strada: da un canto spe ziali, all'incontro stavano tutti medici. Un'altra via: calzolai che facevano scarpe, pianelle e stivali, dall'altro tutti I cuoiai..." (in every street of the city there were two arts or crafts: on the side of one street all the tailors could be found, on the other side all the shops selling cloth. In another street there were the sellers of medicines on one side, and on the other all the doctors. In another the shoemakers made shoes, slippers and boots, while on the other side of the street there were the leather merchants . . ,).25 In this way, as Paolo Cerchi has observed, the city becomes the ordered container of an encyclopedia, which is reformulated according to rigorously naturalistic criteria.26 The circle with its one hundred radii becomes the diagram of a rational and simplified reordering of the knowledge necessary for human life, in which the traditional hierarchical and far more abstract classification is replaced by empirical and functional criteria (pharmacists/doctors, shoemakers/ leather merchants, etc.). It is a characteristic of this new perspective that the "shops" become the image of the "places" according to which the encyclopedic topic is arranged. The image of the circle returns at the end of the first part of Mondi, in Mondo Massimo (The Greatest World). Now the procedure is no longer defined in terms of "favole poetiche, ο finzioni uscite dal sapere umano" (poetic fables, or fictions invented by the human mind) but pursues the way of truth. Charity claims to speak now, explaining that she is the center of the soul. "Il centra è punto indivisibile; nientedimeno tutte le linee da quello alia circonferentia mosse, complicate in sé contiene, et in tutte, quasi esplicando s'estende" (The center is an indivisible point. Nevertheless, all the lines extending from there to the circumference contain the center entwined within them, 22 Doni 1562,143. 23 Doni 1562,173. 24 More 1971,47. Doni 1562,174. 26 Cerchi 1988, 303: "This city, seen from its central temple, is like a panopticon which allows a general and simultaneous view of all the professions."</page><page sequence="8">38 LINA BOLZONI almost seeming to explicate it in their extension).27 At this point, Doni is repeating a traditional image that explains the relation between multiplicity and unity.28 This allows us to look again, in a new light, at the structure of the ideal city, where the possibility of regulating life according to nature expands, becomes more articulate, more visible, and at the same time concentrates on a center and realizes itself in its entirety. But given that everything has its contrary, as Doni often remarks, this image brings to mind a particular aspect of the fable of the seers that introduces the Mondo savio, or Wise World. Doni derives the fable from the Facezie of Piovano Arlotto (and passes it on to Campanella).29 In the fable, the seers foresee that there will be torrential rains and that everyone will go mad because of the terrible stench that will rise from the ground. The seers try to think of a way of defending themselves, so as to avoid such lunacy and to achieve domin ion over a world gone mad. What happens, however, is that the madmen, being decidedly more numerous, stronger, and more vigorous, win the day and force the seers to live as they do. What interests us here is the description of the precautions taken by the seers: "Cosî questi strologatori, ο indovini che io mi voglia dire, antivedendo questa materia, si ristrinsero insieme, cioè unirono tutta la lor saviezza in uno e fecero fare una stanza con tre ο quattro cerchi di mûri, et la fecero foderar d'asse, et turar tutti i buchi et tutti i fessi de gli usci et delle finestre, accioché Ί puzzore della terra non andasse loro al cerbero" (Thus these astrologers, or seers, or whatever you want to call them, foreseeing what was going to happen, got together and gathered all their knowledge into one room that had three or four circles of walls, and they had it lined in wood, and they filled up all the gaps and cracks in the windows and doors, so that the stench would not filter inside and affect their brains). Then it started to rain, and "corsero a imbucarsi là dentro in quella casa matta che egli havevano fatto fare a bella posta" (they ran inside, into that fortress they had had built on purpose).30 The term used here, the "casa matta," is intentionally ambiguous (meaning both fortress and madhouse) and underlines the ambivalence of the situation. This is a building in which all wisdom is concentrated. It is a fortress that defends people from the madness that prevails outside. On the other hand, it is closed in on itself and so becomes claustrophobic, leading the house of wisdom to become the house of folly. It would be possible to use this description of the construction of the "madhouse" to exemplify some of the characteristics of Utopian cities that have engaged the attention of earlier scholars, including, for example, their complete artificiality and isolation, their nature as closed worlds, and their use as a defense against the "otherness" of the world outside.31 The "madhouse" of the seers is in many respects a counterpart of the city in The Wise World. To return to the theme of this essay, the "madhouse" functions as an example of a powerless and pretentious encyclopedia. Furthermore, it should be observed that the seers are violently attacked in the text for their frenetic desire for dominion. As the academic pilgrim known as The Wise Man remarks to his readers when he introduces the little story of the "madhouse": they can judge the world of that story to be as mad or as sane as they like. He cares very little, even if it is called a world of hermaphrodites. In 27 Doni 1562, 202 and 213. 28 See Poulet 1961. 29 Luigi Firpo noted that the sonnet by Campanella, "Senno senza forza de' savi delle genti antiche esser soggetto alia forza de' pazzi," probably derives from the fable with which Doni introduces the Mondo savio (see Campanella 1954, 1320: sonnet no. 13). Doni's text probably derives from Piovano Arlotto (see Campanella 1977, 121). See also Folena 1953, facezia 94, 148-149. Folena draws attention to a variation on this story in Fregoso 1506. Costanzo Di Girolamo has furthermore communicated to the author that this theme is present in the troubadour tradition: see Una cmtat fo, no saicals, byCardenal 1975,3:1515-1518, where its origins in folklore are underlined. }0Doni 1562, 168.

The Città felice (Happy City) of Francesco Patrizi da Cherso It is well known that the little work that the young Francesco Patrizi dedicates to the description of The Happy City (1553) is based on the idea that a large part of its population lives in slavery.33 Of the six classes into which the population is divided, only three (the warriors, the governors, and the priests) are citizens in the full sense of the word. These classes are free. They participate in the government of the city and can aspire to happiness; for the entire organization of the city is directed toward that aim. This happiness, seen as a privilege enjoyed by only a few (even if the whole social fabric is constituted with such happiness as its goal), is considered a virtue in the Aristotelian sense, but it also contains Platonic and Hermetic implications, resembling as it does a kind of heroic or divine fury. The way in which Patrizi presents his text in his letter of dedication to Urbano and Girolamo della Rovere is of great interest in the context of the theme developed in this essay. He tells us that he has "ridotto le ordinationi et statuti che Aristotele vuole che habbia una città, che debba essere felice, in bello et brieve ordine, et concatenato in modo che si possa facilmente vedere la necessità di quelle ordinationi" (synthesized the order and the statutes that, according to Aristotle, should govern a city, which ought to be happy, in a pleasing and compact order, so devised as to allow an easy overview of those statutes).34 The expressions italicized above indicate that the young Patrizi was already cultivating an interest he would later develop further in significant ways: that is, an interest in the new developments in logic and rhetoric, in order to achieve a method at the same time rapid, functional, and easily visualized, and therefore endowed with a considerable persuasive force. The strategies he used to gather together his material, and reduce it to order, become evident in the course of composition of his text, allowing the reader to trace their patterns. They are of differing types, but all of them have a common characteristic: that is, they derive the distribution of social and economic functions from the classification of the different human faculties, as well as from the needs that derive from them. Thus, in contrast with Doni's approach in The Wise World, the scheme of Patrizi's encyclopedia is decidedly hierarchical. The central idea is that the city serves to conserve the link between body and soul. The con servation of life is thus a primary condition for the acquisition of virtues, and so of happiness. For this reason, Patrizi constructs a classification of the different human needs, and to each category he assigns a corresponding category of workers. We can visualize this procedure with a diagram or with a numerical scheme that reveals a decided preference for certain numbers (above all, 3 and 7). As well as this anthropomorphic image of the city (and these are the medicines, Patrizi writes, that will purge the body of our city of all its bad humors that might bring pain and torment to it, whether to particular members or to the whole body), we also find in this text the image of a logical "tree" that is developed in the light of certain allegorical/mnemonic procedures.35 32 Doni 1562, 168. 33 For further bibliographical indications, see Bolzoni 1980 and Vasoli 1989. 34 Patrizi 1553, fols. 2r-v. 35 For the image of the city as a body, see Patrizi 1553, fols. 10v-l lr.

And so that no envious woodworm eat into this flourishing tree, the surrounding ground must be watered with the cool water of equality [...]. For I believe that this would destroy those damned woodworms at birth, preventing them from biting into the unity of the tree, and consuming it from the roots upwards. [. . .] But if it should happen that any one branch start to feed on its own evil humors, instead of nourishing itself on the general good of the tree, wishing harm to its neighbors, it would be necessary to cut it off with an axe.36 The image of the tree is used here with moral overtones, as well as mirroring the procedure according to which the text itself is constructed. Moreover, in the Venetian context in which Patrizi moved, the expression that would soon be used to indicate the logical procedure with which material is reduced to order, and visualized in diagram form, is precisely that of "reducing it to the order of the tree" (fig. I).37 Another image that performs the same structural function, and is also repeated insistently in the text, is that of the mountain to be climbed, accompanied by indications of the various stages of the ascent. The fact that the Happy City, as noted above, is constructed with the sole purpose of guaranteeing perfect happiness to the elect is represented with this image of the mountain. Its peak is where happiness has its home, a paradise full of delight. There it is possible to drink the waters of the supercelestial fountain.38 Using a scheme that reminds us of the medieval and encyclopedic image of the great chain of being (fig. 2), Patrizi places the different classes of citizens on the dif ferent steps that lead up the mountain. Of the lowest or peasant class he says that they are a set of men who precede everyone else, clearing the road ahead so that it is possible to get to the top. And given that the produce of the earth needs to be refined, we find above them crowds of millers, of men grinding chickpeas, of grinders of corn, of bakers, butchers, and cooks. Because these men need tools for their work, we then find another crowd, this time of artisans, of stonebreakers, build ers, carpenters, and smithies. Given that everyone needs to be dressed, we also find those who are expert in sewing clothes of silk for the citizens, and so on.39 What we have here, then, is a kind of procession that winds tidily along the various stations in an ascent that only a few (that is, only the elite) will finally surmount. So here too the different classes of citizen are ordered according to the pattern of an encyclopedic map, although the various relationships among them are no longer divided into a binary relationship, as in Doni. In fact here, instead of the circle, we have a tree or a mountain: that is, images with a high limit and a low one, constructed according to a precise line of development that implies a hierarchical order. 36 Patrizi 1553, fol. 10r. 37 This expression can be found, for example, in the editorial programs of the Accademia della Fama, of which Patrizi was a member, as well as in the works of Orazio Toscanelli who, after the closure of the Academy, carried into effect many of its projects (see Bolzoni 1995). 38Patrizi 1553, fols. 3r-4v. 39Patrizi 1553, fols. 7r, 7v, and 8v.</page><page sequence="11">4« Delia Uipoteticd tcrgomentdtione", '(Commcffa } &lt;J Conditional:, VUipoteticd •&lt; Congiunta &gt; altrimente ^ Copulatiua.

Tommaso Campanella's La città del sole (The City of the Sun) So we return in the end to the text from which we began, Tommaso Campanula's City of the Sun. As in Mores earlier book, the suggestions deriving from the journey of discovery are entwined with a dimension of allegory. The visitor in The City of the Sun, called The Genovese, claims to have been a helmsman with Christopher Colombus. The story narrates that when he arrived in Taprobana, after having sailed around the world, he had to ward off an attack and so made a forced landing: "mi rinselvai ed uscii in un gran piano proprio sotto l'equinoziale" (I ran into a wood and came out in the middle of a large plain right under the equinoctial line).40 This journey, which brings him ever closer to the city of the sun, thus appears as a journey toward deeper knowledge and purification. The wood clearly implies a reminiscence of Dante's journey. If, as we have already underlined, an efficient system of education guarantees for all the citizens an approach to the encyclopedia of the arts and sciences, it can also be argued that the city itself is organized in a way that makes it into a visible and persuasive image of the new encyclopedia proposed by Campanella. The city functions as an image of Campanula's philosophy. This means that we can use the tables prepared by Campanella to illustrate his Metaphysics (figs. 3-4) in order to visualize the system of knowledge that inspires The City of the Sun,41 We can, then, use the image of the "tree" as a means of visualization, as we did with Patrizi, although with the difference that here the tree lives with and within the circle, so to speak. That is to say, the encyclopedia of knowledge is no longer the privileged possession of those at the peak of a social hierarchy but is intended as the structural foundation of an entire community, spread ing its beneficial rays over the whole social body. It is well known that the leader of Campanella's City of the Sun (placed at the root of the tree and at the same time at the center of the circle or the social hierarchy) is a priestly prince called Sun, or the Metaphysician. With his universal knowl edge, he represents the unifying root of multiplicity, while at the same time he guarantees the city against tyranny. Three princes obey him. They are called Pon, Sin, and Mor, and they correspond to Campanula's three primary metaphysical principles: Power, Knowledge, and Love. The different governing bodies of the city, and the different officials in charge of the various sectors, refer back to these princes, according to their specific qualifications. This concept is illustrated by the following passage, which could well be visualized in the form of a logical tree: Li capi principali delle scienze son soggetti al Sapienza, [...] che è esso Sole [...] Sotto a lui sta il Grammatico, il Logico, il Fisico, il Medico, il Politico, l'Economico, il Morale, I'Astronomo, l'Astrologo, il Geometra, il Cosmografo, il Musico, il Prospettivo, l'Aritmetico, il Poeta, l'Oratore, il Pittore, il Scultore.

Under Power, we find the Strategist, the Smith, the Weapons Maker, the Money Maker, the Engineer, the Master Spy, the Groom, the Gladiator, the Artilleryman, the Slingsman, and the Judge.42 This immediate transcription of the encyclopedia into the urban spaces of the city becomes even more evident when it is explained that every virtue has its own officer, called Liberality, Magnanim ity, etc. In this way, the moral system is reproduced or photographed in the ranking of the various officers. The ancient tradition of the personification of the virtues is taken literally. It is in the spaces of Utopia that they find their places and the possibility of reciting their parts. The Ospitalario objects that if all the goods are communal, nobody will want to work, and there will be no friendship, etc. The reply of the Genovese, constantly repeated, is: "Io non so disputare, ma ti dico che . . (I don't know how to dispute, but what I can tell you is this . . .): that is, I saw it all, and that is how things were.43 Thomas More had already used the same technique with his Hathloday. Logical argument and disputing are brushed aside. The city, one could say, explains itself. It is immediately persuasive. The Utopian city communicates through the recital of its spaces and the pattern of its images. It could be claimed that these are long-lasting characteristics of the genre. Calvino, when he analyzed the texts of Fourier, the "Ariosto of the Utopian writers," emphasized their visionary but at the same time obsessively classificatory characteristics.44 42Campanella 1941, 92. 43 Campanella 1941, 62. 44 Calvino 1980,225ff.</page><page sequence="17">UTOPIAN CITIES IN CINQUECENTO ITALY 47 Bibliography Baczko, Β., Lumières de l'Utopie (Paris 1978). , Entry on Utopia in Enciclopedia, vol. 14 (Turin 1981) 856-920.
