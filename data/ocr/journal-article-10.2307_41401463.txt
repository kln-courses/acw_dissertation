<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Erin McGraw Familiar Pleasures: Some Masters* Of the many pleasures held out by books, one of the most potent is that of discovery. Readers love the opportunity to explore unfamiliar lives, to ponder the questions that shape those lives, to participate imaginatively in struggles that are unique and engrossing. Readers are armchair versions of hunters on the veldt, all of us stalking unanticipated interests, undimmed excitement, some fresh way of seeing our world. Not surprisingly, we tend to expect this freshness of vision most from new books and new authors. But powerful pleasures of discovery can also be delivered by familiar material. Returning to a world that has already been closely delineated by a writer allows us to sink more deeply into that world, to better appreciate its priorities and to observe more carefully the psycho- logical progress of its denizens. Popular novelists understand the power of such familiarity very well; they know that most fans buy books specifically because they want to return to the physical and psychological territory imag- ined in the last two or three or four novels by a Tom Clancy or Stephen King or Mary Higgins Clark or Anne Rice. Literary writers, too, often focus their energies on a single locale or stratum of society, allowing us the thrill of recognition while also deepening our understanding of a place and its inhabitants. Returning to a situation allows a thoughtful author to ring changes on it- examining setting from different perspectives, placing characters in the way of shifting forces, exploring the weight of history and social disruption. In this manner writers such as Peter Taylor, who examined the wealthy and near-wealthy in Tennessee throughout * An essay-review of The Atonement and Other Stories. By Louis Auchincloss.

[743]</page><page sequence="2">744 THE GEORGIA REVIEW his long career, are able to give readers an extraordinarily full experience of a particular society- its assumptions, its secrets, its burdens and delights. In- deed, when someone as acute as Taylor writes repeatedly about the same place and cast of characters, I come to know that place better than I know my own community, since in my daily life I lack such an insightful guide. The pleasures of familiarity increase, of course, with rereading. Once we have made the journey through a novel or story and learned its basic terrain, the work's landscape, which had seemed so chaotic upon first reading, reveals itself as patterned and skillfully arranged. When a reader knows what repeated word or image, what misleadingly quiet characterization to watch for, reader and book can achieve a happy intimacy, the gleeful collusiveness of a shared secret. To give an example, a first reading of William Goyen's transporting "Had I a Hundred Mouths" is a shocking, nearly visceral experience. Readers must struggle to marry Goyen's shocking material (incest and mutilation) to language that is not only lush but strangely loving, filled with biblical allu- sions to forgiveness and lovingkindness. Rereading demonstrates that Goyen's effects depend not just on the high-octane fascination provided by his gothic material, but also on carefully developed allusions to Greek and Christian mythology. Ultimately those allusions give the story its own mythic dimen- sion, one considerably more resonant than the mere shock and titillation of subject matter. But because Goyen is a skillful writer who knows how to keep the skeleton of a story properly covered, the fullness of his artistry is more apparent for readers who sit down with the work a second or third time. Of course, rereading can also be a dismaying activity, particularly if we return after many years to a well-loved book of our adolescence. Those themes and voices that spoke to us so compellingly don't always have a long shelf life (I submit, for example, that it's almost impossible for anyone over age thirty to read Salinger with admiration), and sometimes plots that felt bold and visionary upon first reading come to feel strained, melodramatic, or jejune ( Portnoy's Complaint volunteering itself as an example). Every reader will have his or her own list of titles. But enduring work invites readers into a deepening kinship with a writer's obsessions and themes. We might read new work that returns us to a writer's signature society or locale, or we might reread work already published- and in this essay I will consider two books from each category. In either case the pleasures of the familiar allow readers to respond with particular acuity, and to weigh with special care the perceptions, burnished by time and long pon- dering, that the writers hold out to us. The strength of these books lies not in mere familiarity or mere surprise, but in their ability to wed the two, so that what readers thought they already understood gives way to a new under- standing, a greater depth, a fuller pleasure. #</page><page sequence="3">ERIN MCGRAW 745 Louis Auchincloss has long been known as a chronicler of the wealthy and powerful-bankers, lawyers, inheritors of monetary and social privilege. Throughout his career- he has published an astonishing thirty-nine volumes of fiction- he has focused on the American gentry, a slice of society rarely glimpsed by most of us. Story after story in book after book has analyzed the lives of men and women whose attitudes and choices are shaped by their wealth and family names. In a literary age such as our own, in which minority and disenfranchised voices have become important, Auchincloss' work feels almost quaint, centering as it does on a world in which the characters use the word right not so much in connection with issues of morality as with issues of appropriateness- the right school to attend, the right family to marry into. But a deep morality quietly attends Auchincloss' vision, a sense of final judgment that is suggested by the title of his most recent collection, The Atonement and Other Stories . Again and again his characters are forced not only to confront the errors of their lives- bad decisions based on willfulness, desire, unrestrained appetites, or off-center impulses- but to make restitution for those errors, often in complicated ways. Auchincloss, who has been appro- priately compared to Henry James, writes stories in which actions are not simple, motivations are not unmixed, and characters are connected to others at many dimensions of obligation. The title story is a fine example. Sandy Tremain, who is well-off, good- looking, and practicing insider trading from his Manhattan brokerage, suffers a crisis of conscience. He watches his wife Amanda, who is studying what he assumed was the editorial page of the Times to cull her opinions for the day. Amanda prided herself on having moved to the left of her admired father's extreme right wing; she was a fan of Adlai Stevenson. She had met the former Illinois governor and been charmed by him. She was very proud of that. She talked a lot about it. And why, pray, was he having such snippy thoughts? The last sentence displays the signature Auchincloss perspective: catching a character in the act of self-observation. His characters are given to scrutiny and reflection; they seek some final, fair judgment. And so Sandy watches his silly wife and despises her, but at the same time despises himself more for breaking the law at the brokerage and putting her at risk. With brisk efficiency the story traces Sandy's distress as examiners from the Securities Exchange Commission turn their scrutiny on him, but the real center of Auchincloss' concern has to do with Sandy's hunger to take respon- sibility for his actions. He longs to confess and atone, to begin his life anew upon a bedrock of honesty. But however he might long for such public cleansing, he has a wife and two daughters whose entire security rests on the family's social position- a position that Sandy can only protect by refusing to</page><page sequence="4">74Â¿ THE GEORGIA REVIEW confess. When he protests to his father, in the story's final scene, that his wife could marry someone else, someone scandal free, and his children could take the new husband's name, his father chides him for selfishness: "And you can forget all about them; isn't that the point? So you can enjoy your bath of self-pity and see yourself as a kind of ro- mantic international drifter! . . . Your job is right here, my son. And it's going to be a tough one, believe me. So tough that no penance will be required for any wrong you've done. . . . I'll order a cab and drive you home." The net that draws around Sandy's feet is ultimately not the net of falsehood and indiscretion but that of obligation, whose strands prove to be considerably stickier. The notion of atonement-not mere repentance, but trying to find a way to undertake a fresh, unsullied life- preoccupies this collection. In "The Last Great Divorce" socialite Clarinda Eliot ponders Howard Eberling, her second husband, who endured public excoriation when he deserted his first wife to marry "the wife of his closest friend and law partner," as one newspaper column indignantly pointed out. Unable to tolerate the opprobrium, Howard withdraws from the social life that first attracted Clarinda to him, becoming a cheerful academic hermit and presenting her with an increasingly deadened existence. Despairingly, she looks at him and thinks that "this new life was a kind of atonement," one that costs her far more than it costs Howard. More comically, "The Maenads" sketches the defunct marriage of a graceful social climber: Gabriella, who had originally seen him as a charming brand to be plucked from the burning, a task, as she deemed it, to atone for the unseemly passion that had drawn her to him, had at last given up the hopeless task of weaning him from an existence of watchful opportunism and reducing him to the death-in-life of her father's dim little bank, and had withdrawn with her two prim boys to a disapproving isolation. Even in this sardonic passage, the notion persists that atonement draws us into closer relationship with those around us. Gabriella strives, for a while, to make up for the regrettable result of her passion by confining her rakish husband to her father's "dim little bank," and as the story progresses, we see that her eventual withdrawal still manages to cast a long, chilling shadow over her ex- husband's life. The passage above also carries, in its formal syntax and detachment, a self-consciously old-fashioned quality only partly undercut by the long sen- tence's humor. Auchincloss, who is in his eighties, writes prose that seems to belong to the first half of this century, sentences that interrupt themselves to ponder, amend, modify, reconsider. The style emphasizes nuance over move-</page><page sequence="5">ERIN M Ð¡ GR AW 747 ment, and in his first-person stories has a theatrical, even bombastic tone. "The Golden Voice," for instance, takes the form of a dramatic monologue in which Seamus McLanahan, former district attorney for Manhattan and former US Ambassador to India, says to his interlocutor: . . . you'd like to hear something of my failures? You don't really believe I had any failures? Well, Mr. Gigadibs, there you are wrong. You are terribly wrong. My whole life has been a failure, not a tragic failure, but a pathetic failure. And that , my friend, is the only thing worth talking about, and talk about it I shall. The power that Auchincloss extracts from passages such as this comes more from conventions of the stage than from those of the page; his appeal here derives from the drama of a single, strong voice, not from intricacies of lan- guage. The attractiveness of this passage comes from Auchincloss' ability to present a character whose very privilege feels exotic to most readers, whose wealth and opportunities might make him seem unbelievable had not the author created, across fifty years of fiction writing, a world populous enough to hold this Seamus McLanahan without straining. Reflecting his career as a lawyer, Auchincloss writes stories that unfold with unfailing logic and persuasion, bringing readers ultimately to a judgment he has foreseen from the start. His characters are not undone by the crude, obvious traps of privilege-gluttony, for instance, or acquisitiveness- but by the much keener blades of duty and honor. And their stories take on weight and credibility because they are told by a writer who has observed these people at length and with an intelligent compassion that few writers, these days, will expend on the rich. To move from the stories of Louis Auchincloss to those of Padgett Powell feels almost like a shift in genre. The two authors' approaches to short fiction could hardly be more different: where Auchincloss charts his stories firmly in New York society's upper reaches, Powell situates his in a landscape that is often blurry, that is in fact not even reliably terrestrial, although it always sounds Southern. While Auchincloss' stories have a dependable, classical, fixed structure, Powell's are extraordinarily fluid; in some cases they simply chuck traditional notions of plot and character development to sail on comedy and rhythm alone. Nevertheless, just as Auchincloss marks out his territory by references to boarding schools and the names of investment firms, Powell declares himself unmistakably by the nature of his brazen, freewheeling, hy- perarticulate, and hilarious narrative voice. "Trick or Treat" begins like this: On her way to the grocery store, to which she could walk, in celebration of which she often wore lizard-skin cowboy boots and</page><page sequence="6">748 THE GEORGIA REVIEW other dress excessive for a daily trip to buy food for a family, Mrs. Hollingsworth recited, "It loves me, it loves me not. I love iÃ­, I love it not-" until she was interrupted by a child behind a picket fence next to the sidewalk. "What are you talking about, lady?" This came equably from a round freckled face just above the sharpened pickets, all of which suggested briefly an uncarved, unlit pumpkin speaking to her. "The South," Mrs. Hollingsworth said to the pumpkin face, which she presumed, not altogether comfortably, a portrait of innocence. The child was in fact a portrait of insolence and had wanted to say not "What are you talking about, lady?" but "Hey, lady, how about some pussy? " He had watched her for weeks walk in costumes to and from the store and he had prodigious twelve- year-old need. Pretty much every aspect of this passage teeters on a delightful, absurd pin- nacle-the lustful, calculating boy with his round face; the overdressed woman chanting a child's rhyme on her way to the grocery store; and the mock- solemn language, perfectly steady in tone, that describes the two characters. The narrative voice unflappably notes the sharpness of the picket fence, the inappropriateness of Mrs. Hollingsworth' s boots, and the incongruous depth of the boy's sexual desire. The restraint of tone, no matter what is being de- scribed, only makes the passage funnier. Voice, of course, is one of the great preoccupations of Southern writers. From William Faulkner to James Dickey, Southern fiction in this century has been characterized by forceful, strongly developed voices, and Powell is both an inheritor and one of the best living interpreters of this tradition. His par- ticular gift lies in his ability to create a voice that can hold contradictory impulses- hope and resignation, desire and repulsion- by yoking them with puns and associative leaps. A particularly intricate example is provided in the lengthy "All Along the Watchtower," which begins with a character named Mr. Albemarle strolling along a parapet and pondering. He doesn't know how he arrived in this place, and fog obscures whatever might lie in the moat be- neath him. He is visited first by soldiers and then by extraterrestrial beings who announce themselves as "aliens of affection." Struggling with this con- cept, Mr. Albemarle says, "You mean, when a man finds his wife naked on another man's sailboat and he sues the yachtsman for alienation of affection-" "Yes. We are in attendance." "We are on that boat, usually," said another alien of affection. The first alien slapped this second alien upside the head with a flipper-like arm. "We are always on that boat." The aliens take a reading on Mr. Albemarle and pronounce that "the worm of his passion is twisted"; then they wish him well and depart, leaving him to brood.</page><page sequence="7">ERIN IVÃ CGR AW 749 MÅ. Albemarle knew that the aliens meant something deeper and worse, as they had told him, and that they were right. His passion was bent and his desire was dirty and veiled. He knew men whose passion was straightforward and whose desire was clean and open and who were not Pat Boone. They were true cowboys of the heart. . . . These cowboys had cowgirls; open-eyed girls in red skirts who danced with you if you asked and kissed you back if you waited long enough to kiss them first. And a true cowboy knew how to wait, and he knew whom to kiss in the first place. Mr. Albemarle did not know whom to kiss because he wanted to kiss no one, really, and when he got tired of that he wanted to kiss everyone. At that point, waiting seemed contraindicated. Waiting for what? For everyone to say yes? Powell slams together abstract, high diction with conversational idiom, skips from metaphysics to cowboys, shifts from the detached, formal language of a diagnostician's office to the clear exasperation of the passage's final sentence. The result isn't realism- no human talks the way Powell's characters think- but Powell isn't after realism. Instead, the passage, like many in this volume, gives emphatic expression to the highest and lowest human desires, which wind tightly around each other. Powell doesn't try to pry them apart, for in his hands there is very little difference between the highest and lowest human desires. By the end of "AH Along the Watchtower," a cowgirl (Dale Mae) has materialized for Mr. Albemarle, and every time he veers back toward brooding obsessiveness, she hikes up her red skirts to remind him that the unease of the brain can never be quelled, but the unease of the body can. Solace enough. Most of the stories in Aliens of Affection eventually map out the way to this solace. Characters as diverse as Mrs. Hollingsworth in her lizard-skin boots, a cuckolded college professor, and a schizophrenic (who may or may not own a forty-seven-pound chihuahua) on the lam from his medications all find relief through the ministrations of the body. Even Wayne, who was featured in Powell's previous collection Ð¢Ñ pical- fearful Wayne with his un- reliable potency and his green-specked teeth- is able to find a Pamela Forktine who yearns for him. Notwithstanding the book's title, the characters in Aliens of Affection do ultimately find partners, and the stories' firm, clear resolutions feel like a final gesture of generosity from an author unusually generous with his gifts. Upon a first reading, Muriel Spark's new volume of collected stories appears to be a book at odds with itself. Although Open to the Public runs to almost four hundred pages and contains thirty-seven stories, it doesn't seem dense or even particularly full; if anything, it quite often feels understated. Although many of the stories teeter on the verge of the gothic, relating the actions of ghosts, vengeful and destructive seraphs, or flying antique china saucers, the</page><page sequence="8">750 THE GEORGIA REVIEW narrative is typically fueled by a breezy, brisk tone that can be unsettling. It takes a while to accustom oneself to Spark's world, in which extraordinary things occur but characters don't seem terribly upset by them. Spark's characters do seem a little bit upset, though, and this small edge of psychological realism gives these stories their off-balance thrill. The ghost (nicknamed Needle) who narrates "The Portobello Road" nonchalantly re- lates in a single sentence that her friend George killed her- "He looked as if he would murder me and he did." She then spends a paragraph detailing how George buried her corpse in a haystack. The paragraph ends: Then George climbed down, took up his bottle of milk and went his way. I suppose that was why he looked so unwell when I stood, nearly five years later, by the barrow in the Portobello Road and said in easy tones, "Hallo, George!" The tone is so dry that it's difficult to calibrate how much malice lies in Needle's greeting, and how much genuine, daffy pleasure at seeing an old friend. Spark delights in uncertainty of this sort, in which kindness is nearly inseparable from nastiness, and the resulting tension keeps her stories from becoming a string of mere curiosities in which odd events occur and char- acters say ambiguous things. Often Spark brings ambiguity to a symphonic level of complexity, a dizzying accretion of guesses, contradictions, and a growing unease that is her stock in trade: she creates the effects of a horror story without writing anything horrifying. In her masterly "The Twins," members of a normal- seeming family smoothly lie to one another and to the narrator, silkily shifting blame and assigning malice until even the simplest human exchange begins to feel evil, or at least suspect. In "Alice Long's Dachshunds" a little girl who fears that she lost one of her landlady's five dogs dances with joy and relief when she learns that all of the dogs have been found hanged. And in "The Leaf Sweeper" dotty Johnnie, who hates Christmas, encounters another ver- sion of himself, which might be a ghost and might be a symbol- a Johnnie who loves Christmas. The two Johnnies quarrel, and the story ends after they have merged into a single, unhappy creature. The narrator, who has sympa- thetically watched Johnnie's transformation, comments: The town council gave [Johnnie] the leaves of the park to sweep. He seldom speaks, and recognises nobody. I see him every day at the late end of the year, working within the mist. Sometimes, if there is a sudden gust, he jerks his head up to watch a few leaves falling behind him, as if amazed that they are undeniably there, although, by rights, the falling of leaves should be stopped. The final phrase is a judgment by the story's narrator (most of Spark's stories are written in the first person), a statement of compassion for and solidarity with Johnnie. Its firmness of tone, however, suggests that the phrase is not a</page><page sequence="9">ERIN M Ð¡ GR AW 75 1 wistful desire on the narrator's part, but a statement of mild outrage, as if the falling of leaves can and must be stopped, a state of affairs that should be taken up with the mayor. This marriage of a logical, almost flat-footed tone with the plot's airiness gives the story an interest it would otherwise lack, a screw- ball balance of empathy and efficiency. I don't know of any other writer who could pull it off. And, of course, the passage is beautifully written. To read Spark is to encounter delight after delight; she is a precise and witty stylist, and her de- scriptions, particularly of characters, are matchless. Not mere catalogues of physical attributes, her assessments include judgments of attitude and spirit, as in this breakdown of one Daisy Overend: A tubular skirt clung to her hips, a tiny cap to her hair, and her hair clung, bronzed and shingled, to her head, like the cup of a toy egg of which her face was the other half. Her face was a mere lobe. Her eyes were considered to be expressive and they expressed avarice in various forms . . . Now, she did not drink. I saw her sipping barley water while her guests drank her gin. But Daisy had danced the Charleston in her youth with a royal prince, and of this she assured me several times, speaking with swift greed while an alcoholic look came over her. "Those times were divine," she boozily concluded, "they were ripping." Although the tone is not quite satiric, it is close, and whatever small amount of respect a reader might have mustered for the flapper of the first paragraph is shredded by the blowzy, tipsy image of the third. Open to the Public is strewn with tidy observations that will often leave readers uneasy as to the mental state of the speaker: in "The Playhouse Called Remarkable," the narrator finds herself in a conversation with a man who claimed to have come from the moon. "As a provisional measure," she wryly thinks, "I worked it out that either he was mad or that he was not mad." And "The Pawnbroker's Wife" begins on a note of horrifying calm, like a passage by Gabriel Garcia Marquez blended with one by John Hawkes: "At Sea Point, on the coast of the Cape of Good Hope, in 1942, there was everywhere the sight of rejoicing, there was the sound of hilarity, and the sea washed up each day one or two bodies of servicemen in all kinds of uniform." Such moments appear frequently. Spark's work has remained remarkably consistent throughout her career, and the deadpan accuracy that characterizes "The Portobello Road," the first story in the volume, is still in full swing for "The Hanging Judge," the last. Naturally enough, not all of the many stories are perfectly satisfying- "The Girl I Left Behind Me" is formulaic, as is "The Ormulu Clock," a selection that is mystifyingly often chosen for anthologies even though its thudding symbolism is far from Spark's best work. Other stories reveal the imprint of Spark's peers: "The Dragon" recalls Angela</page><page sequence="10">752 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Carter, and "The Thing About Police Stations" is a Flann O'Brien-ish pirou- ette into absurdity. But most of the pieces included in Open to the Public are satisfying in Muriel Spark's complex fashion- funny, troubling, lingering long in the mind. If Open to the Public demonstrates a literary talent that has remained amaz- ingly consistent, The Complete Stories by Bernard Malamud shows its readers the evolution of a writer- a very different experience. The fifty-five stories here illustrate the enlarging of Malamud's sense of narrative, his experiments with style and approach, his return visits to subject matter that compelled him. It is instructive, to say the least, to study the development of one of this century's masters. It is also a joy. Malamud's fiction has a depth and command of tone hardly approached by any other writer of his time. Using an ornate comic voice, he brings to the page material that is often otherworldly, often terrifying. Frequently com- pared to Flannery O'Connor, another writer who used rough humor to de- scribe divine actions in merely human lives, Malamud wrote fiction that teeters on a slender fence separating realism from allegory. But unlike O'Connor's, Malamud's work rarely holds a wild, supernatural sense of release. For him, comedy is a frail shelter erected against the unspeakably bitter reality of hu- man existence. His stories are powered by a raging despair; they feel like cries to the universe indicting a God who could have created humans so flawed, so morally tiny. His best-known creations are ironic, Yiddish-inflected tales in which some inexplicable action interrupts the lives of hard-working, disgruntled students and businessmen. The characters find themselves, generally against their will, lifted to a realm of vision and understanding that forces them to reassess their lives: Manischevitz, in "Angel Levine," acknowledges the hypocrisy that has shaped him, and Schwartz, the title character in the hilarious and horrifying "Jewbird," dies from a vicious act of prejudice. These tales and others for which Malamud became famous were written in the middle of his career, not at the end. The period of his best-known stories extended roughly ten years, starting with the publication of "The Magic Barrel" in 1953. But by the mid-1960's Malamud's interest had moved away from the Jewish ghosts and charlatan healers and angels that had pre- occupied him. Instead, he began to write more self-reflexive stories that con- cern themselves not so much with the situation of all humanity as with the situation of the artist. Malamud's later pieces frequently center on his alter ego Fidelman, a mediocre American painter living an impoverished existence in Italy, where he is the dupe of whores and thieves. Fidelman is restless in his art, constantly experimenting, swinging back and forth between hubris and self-contemptÂ»</page><page sequence="11">ERIN M Ð¡ GR AW 753 He lovingly copies Tiziano's "Venus- of Urbino" in the story "Naked Nude," creates conceptual sculptures from holes in the ground in "Pictures of the Artist," and is coaxed into ruining his one truly original painting in "A Pimp's Revenge." Malamud appears to be judging his own accomplishment in these stories, and the judgment is fierce. At the end of "A Pimp's Revenge," when Fidelman realizes he has ruined the single hope he might have had for artistic immortality, he wrestles a knife out of his model's hand while Ludovico, the model's pimp, watches. F twisted it out of her grasp, and in anguish lifted the blade into his gut. "This serves me right." "A moral act," Ludovico agreed. The rich irony of the last line, in which a pimp can pronounce, not incor- rectly, on the morality of Fidelman's attempt at suicide, gives a small taste of Malamud at his vintage best: the passage combines hopelessness with humor, and it passes judgment in a way that prevents a final judgment from being made. The Complete Stories is filled with such vivid moments. Like Spark, Malamud is able to describe a character in a single, extraordinary phrase- in "Riding Pants" a butcher strokes "the fat-to-bursting beef-livered cat that looked like him"; in "A Pimp's Revenge" Fidelman, behind on his rent, trudges upstairs "pelted by the landlord's fruity curses"; in the first paragraph of the unforgettable "Idiots First" Mendel pulls on "his cold embittered clothing." The last example might border on the overwrought, but the grief and anger of the phrase allows this reader, at least, to accept that Mendel's bitterness is so extreme it has dripped into his very clothes. Malamud is a master of voice, and both his narrative and his dialogue ripple and sing. However sad a story's plot, and sometimes it is heartbreaking, the voices that carry it are lithe and dexterous, full of pleasures for the reader. In "Take Pity," Rosen, a former coffee salesman, explains to census-taker Davidov the death of a neighbor: "How did he die?" Davidov spoke impatiently. "Say in one word." "From what he died?- he died, that's all." "Answer, please, this question." "Broke in him something. That's how." "Broke what? " "Broke what breaks. He was talking to me how bitter was his life, and he touched me on my sleeve to say something else, but the next minute his face got small and he fell down dead, the wife screaming, the little girls crying that it made in my heart pain. I am myself a sick man and when I saw him laying on the floor, I said to myself, 'Rosen, say goodbye, this guy is finished.' So I said it."</page><page sequence="12">754 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The Yiddish accent is wonderfully wrought through the strained and inverted syntax, the repetition, the unadorned vocabulary. Malamud extracts a kind of wincing beauty from this inelegant speech- "Broke what breaks," Rosen says, and the simplicity of his sentence leaves room for mystery and sorrow to radiate. Sometimes MalamuÄs dialogue rips away from realism entirely, entering an existential realm so pure it seems to reflect the conversation of angels. In "Idiots First," Mendel totters with the last of his energy to collect enough train fare for his dim son Isaac to go to an uncle in California. Throughout the struggles of the long night, Mendel is shadowed by an evil, godlike char- acter named Ginzburg. The extent of Ginzburg's power is impossible to gauge, but he is always present when Mendel is disappointed, humiliated, or denied, and Ginzburg's eyes hold "a shimmering, starry, blinding light that produced darkness." In the end, Ginzburg reveals himself to be the ticket taker guarding the way to the pulsing, chuffing train; he alone will decide whether to let the boy board. "For myself," the old man begged, "I don't ask a thing. But what will happen to my boy? " Ginzburg shrugged slightly. "What will happen happens. This isn't my responsibility. I got enough to think about without worry- ing about somebody on one cylinder." "What then is your responsibility?" "To create conditions. To make happen what happens. I ain't in the anthropomorphic business." "Whatever business you in, where is your pity?" "This ain't my commodity. The law is the law." "Which law is this?" "The cosmic universal law, goddamnit, the one I got to follow myself." "What kind of a law is it?" cried Mendel. "For godsake, don't you understand what I went through in my life with this poor boy? Look at him. For thirty-nine years, since the day he was born, I wait for him to grow up, but he don't. Do you understand what this means in a father's heart? Why don't you let him go to his uncle?" His voice had risen and he was shouting. Isaac mewled loudly. "Better calm down or you'll hurt somebody's feelings," Ginzberg said with a wink toward Isaac. Again Malamud centers on the coldness of the universe to individual pain and helplessness. The ferocity of the conversation is stunning, the rage of Dos- toevski and the cold eye of O'Connor joined by a vision that is convinced of its own inadequacy. Like Jeremiah, Malamud understands himself to be de- feated already. Nevertheless, like Jeremiah he must speak, and from his outrage rises eloquence. The voice is perfect: harrowing and magnificent, unmistakable and enduring. -Qy</page></plain_text>
