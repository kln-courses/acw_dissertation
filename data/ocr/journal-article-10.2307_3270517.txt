<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHISM, RELIGION, AND THE CONCEPT OF "GOD" ILKKA PYYSIAINEN Summary It is here argued that, although the Buddha and the buddhas are not regarded as gods by Buddhists, they clearly fulfill the criteria of "counter-intuitive agents" as they have been presented by Pascal Boyer. To the extent that religion can be understood as human thought, action, and experience that involve counter-intuitive representations, Buddhism does not have to be the problematic touchstone for a global concept of religion. God and Religion Western folk theories, as well as theological theories, of religion are based on the concept of "God." Moreover, as Benson Saler (2000) has argued, even the non-theological scholarly concept of "religion" has been determined by the prototype effect of the Judeo-Christian tradition; by the same token the concept of "God" has come to occupy a prominent role in it. Scholars have implicitly assumed that such beings as for example Vishnu, Zeus, Manitou, or Mithras, all in some sense belong to the same category; they all are gods. Yet it has never been clarified what it is that makes gods gods. It seems that, although the Christian God is considered only one member in this wider category, actually the whole category has been created on the basis of the Judeo- Christian idea of God (Pyysiainen 1997; Pyysiainen and Ketola 1999; cf. also Kazanas 2001). That calling all these beings "gods" may be problematic has been realized by many scholars, and concepts such as "superhuman beings" (Lawson and McCauley 1990:61, 82, 89, 112, 124, 165), "nonnatural entities" (Barrett and Keil 1996), etc. have been substituted for "God." This, however, in no way helps us explain what exactly it is that separates these beings from other kinds of beings and unites them into a coherent category. A new label does not solve the problem; ? Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden (2003) NUMEN, Vol. 50 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">148 Ilkka Pyysidinen only a new theory could do it. The concept of the "supernatural" is notoriously problematic, and "superhumanity" shares the same problems (see Saler 1977). These terms are mere labels with no theory concerning the objects thus labeled. Superhuman beings are identified as such by mere intuition; the set of characteristics that count as "supernatural" or "superhuman" have never been specified (Pyysiainen and Ketola 1999; Pyysiainen 2001:9-23). A somewhat different view has been presented by Stewart Guthrie (1980; 1993; 1996) who thinks that religion is typified by belief in humanlike but nonhuman beings. Such anthropomorphism and animism derive from the fact that all perception is inferential, and our inferences are directed towards ascribing the maximum of organization to our perceptual stimuli. Therefore, we tend to see "faces in the clouds," meaning and purpose in everything that happens, etc. This has been of evolutionary advantage for us: it is for example always better to mistake the wind playing in the long grass for a snake than vice versa. Religious beliefs about nonhuman but humanlike beings are one manifestation of this general tendency to animism and anthropomorphism. What distinguishes religious animism and anthropomorphism from other forms of the same phenomenon has not been specified by Guthrie. Yet he is not willing to discard the category of "religion," but only sees it as a construction based on the prototype effect of some especially salient phenomena (cf. Boyer 1996; Saler 2000; Pyysiainen 2002a). There are thus great difficulties involved in conceptualizing religion as belief in god(s), superhuman agents, etc., although we intuitively think that some such beings, nevertheless, are essential in religion. As is well-known, Buddhism has been the favorite example of scholars who have argued that we should find some other way of defining religion than the one based on the idea of belief in gods or superhuman beings (e.g. Durkheim 1965:37-57; Herbrechtsmeier 1993). It may therefore be useful to re-examine the question of the Buddha's divinity, in order to find a new way of approaching the concepts of "God" and "religion." I shall not try to construct a new "definition" of religion; in definitions we only reduce the defined concepts to undefined ones</page><page sequence="3">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 149 without that much benefit from the point of view of empirical study would be gained. Theories are more important than definitions (see Boyer 1994b:32-34). The Buddha, buddhas, and buddhahood The Westerners that first came into contact with Buddhism, guided by their Christian background, identified the Buddha and the buddhas as god(s). In due course it, however, dawned on them that the Buddhists did not consider buddhas as gods (devas) (see, e.g., Windisch 1917; Lubac 1952; Schwab 1984; de Jong 1974; 1979). But neither are they mere human beings. As the late J.W. de Jong (1979:27) has pointed out, the simple dichotomy man-God is not enough to account for the special status of the Buddha and the buddhas in the Buddhist religion; buddhas rather are beings sui generis and thus form a third category, in addition to "man" and "God." Etienne Lamotte (1948:37-49) has distinguished three research tra- ditions vis-a-vis the figure of the Buddha: mythological, rationalis- tic, and pragmatic. Emile Senart (1882) and Hendrik Kern (1882- 1884:1:296-356), inspired by the nature mythological tradition in comparative religion, saw the legend of the Buddha as a personification of astral phenomena; Kern even doubted whether there ever was a per- son called "Buddha." The rationalists, in turn, thought that behind the legendary elements there was a historical kernel: the Buddha had been for his earliest followers only a wise man and a teacher of ethics as well as of some kind of "psychology" (e.g. Oldenberg 1903:84-230; Rhys Davids 1880). The pragmatic tradition is best exemplified by Lamotte (1948) himself; it emphasizes that the legendary elements belong even to the oldest records we have, and that it thus is not easy to distinguish fact from fantasy in the Buddha legend (also Lamotte 1958:718-733; cf. Thomas 1975; 1971) (see de Jong 1979:23-26). Yet also Lamotte has been criticized for valuing the "canonical" texts as more repre- sentative of "true" Buddhism, compared to non-canonical texts (Pye 1973). Andr6 Bareau's detailed efforts notwithstanding, it is very difficult to determine how the various beliefs concerning the Buddha have</page><page sequence="4">150 Ilkka Pyysidinen evolved (see Bareau 1953; 1962; 1963; 1969; 1970-1971; 1974a; 1974b; 1979; 1980). Bareau accepted the view first put forward by Jean Przyluski (1918-1920:11:515-526, 13:365-429, 15:5-6) that for his first followers the Buddha was just a human being. During the Maurya period (322-185 BC) he then came to be equated with the mythical "wheel-turning king" (cakravartin raija) and thus was seen as a unique being, or a "functional god" of sorts (Bareu 1962:32-33; 1963:361-362; 1969; 1974a:288; 1979:2, 64, 72-73). More recently, there have been a number of attempts to interpret and explain the Buddha legend according to its supposed "symbolic functions" and "mythical meanings" (e.g. L6vy 1982; Elder 1983; Pyysiiinen 1987; see Pye 1979). How living Buddhists actually represent the concept has so far not been studied, except for Gananath Obeyesekere's (1966) paper on Sin- halese Buddhists' perception of the Buddha. Intellectually, Sinhalese Buddhists recognized that the Buddha is dead, but yet emotionally felt that he is somehow present in his relics. More experimental work on such conceptualization, along the lines suggested by Justin Barrett and Frank Keil, is needed. Barrett and Keil (1996) showed through a se- ries of experimental studies that American college students had two kinds of representations of God: the theological concept was based on such rehearsed cultural knowledge as for example that God is omni- scient, omnipotent, etc. However, in fast online reasoning tasks peo- ple unconsciously used a more humanlike representation; God could for example answer a prayer only after he first had finished answer- ing another prayer. Barrett (1998) subsequently replicated the study in India, substituting Brahman, Shiva, Vishnu, and Krishna for God (four different versions of the stories were prepared); the results were essentially the same. Such experimenting should also be done to find out how Buddhists use the concept of "buddha" in their online reason- ing. The early Buddhist texts, however, give support to de Jong's (1979:27) claim that, in Buddhist beliefs, the Buddha and the buddhas are a sui generis type of beings. To provide a couple of examples, in a Theravada text the Buddha replies, when asked, that he is neither a</page><page sequence="5">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 151 god (deva), an "angel" (gandhabba), a "demon" (yakkha), nor a hu- man being, but a buddha (Arnguttaranikdya II 38-39). He is "unique, without a peer, without counterpart, incomparable, unequalled, match- less, unrivalled, best of bipeds" (Arnguttaranikaya I 22). To Cunda, the goldsmith, the Buddha said that the meal offered by him (which even- tually killed the Buddha) was such that it could not be digested by gods or men, only by the Tathdgata (i.e. the Buddha) (DTghanikdya II 126-128). What makes the Buddha unique in Buddhist beliefs is the supposed fact that some kind of inner experience, the nature of which is only very vaguely described, had transformed the suffering and frustrated Gautama into a "perfectly enlightened one" (sammasambuddha). Yet all the texts lack precision of what exactly is supposed to have hap- pened in Gautama's mind at the moment of his "enlightenment." The word bodhi ("enlightenment") appears only in the Mahdsaccakasutta where it is related how the Buddha ponders whether there could be "another way to enlightenment," apart from self-mortification. In the Vinayapitaka, in a probably more recent passage, we read that Gautama had recently become a "fully enlightened one" (pathama- bhisambuddho); his "enlightenment" clearly being taken as something not in need of further explanation (Vinayapitakaz I 1). Even the word nirvdna appears in the earliest accounts of the Buddha's experience only in one passage, in the Ariyapariyesandsutta. There it is said that after years of vain attempts, while meditating in the surroundings of Uruvela, the Buddha immediately attained "the excellent freedom from bondage, nibbana," that was not subject to birth, aging, illness, sorrow and suffering. At that very moment Gautama knew: "My liberation (vimutti) is steadfast. This is the last birth; there will be no more (re)births." (Majjhimanikaya I 167; see Bareau 1980). According to the Suttas Mahasaccaka, Bhayabherava and Dvedha- vitakka, the liberation was preceded by the four states of meditation (jhdna) and the three mental abilities (fidna). The Buddha describes his experience after the third ability: "When I was liberated to freedom I knew: birth is destroyed, Brahma-life lived and the task accomplished.</page><page sequence="6">152 Ilkka Pyysidinen There will be no new life." (Majjhimanikaya I 17-23, 114-117, 247-249). Thus, the Ariyapariyesandsutta is completely silent about how the Buddha reached his nirvana, and the Mahasaccakasutta describes the liberation as due to the practice of the four jhanas ("states of meditation") which the Buddha, however, already had practised for years without success. The jhana states are described by a traditional formula that appears in the Tipitaka 86 times. They are given four different functions: 1) they are preparation for insight (vipassand); 2) preparation for the four or five arapajhinas ("formless meditations"); 3) preparation for the "ways of living like Brahma" (brahmaviharas); or 4) an independent way to nirvana (Griffiths 1983:57-59, 62-65). As to the three fidnas - the ability to remember one's past lives, the ability to see how all beings are (re)born and die, and the ability to un- derstand the asavas ("intoxicants") as they arise and are destroyed - only the last one is specifically Buddhist; the other two belong to the traditional list of six paranormal faculties (abhififia) as they are known in ancient Indian sources (see Jayatilleke 1963:437-438; Jaini 1974; Ariguttaranikaya I 254-256). Therefore the knowledge of the asavas has been seen as the real essence of "enlightenment" as here described (D6mieville 1927:283, 290-291; Bareau 1963:79-84). The four asavas are: sensual pleasures, becoming, ignorance and (later) "views." These appear in the Tipitaka in stereotypical descrip- tions of how someone achieved nirvana by liberating himself from the dsavas, as in the case of the Buddha's first five converts who attained nirvana by merely listening to the Buddha's teaching (Vinayapitakari I 10-20). No further explanation of the nature of this liberation is pro- vided, and in later Buddhism the asavas no longer play a central role (Johansson 1985:177; Masefield 1986:85). At some point in time, the idea that the four jhanas culminate in the destruction of the intoxicants has been connected with the view that the insight is based on an un- derstanding of the "four noble truths." In this way, a combination of these two alternatives has come to be considered the true nature of the liberating insight (Bronkhorst 1986:95-98, 100-104; cf. Schmithausen 1981:205).</page><page sequence="7">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 153 There is also the (possibly later) belief that Gautama had striven for the perfect enlightenment through several cycles of rebirths, which implies that before his last rebirth as Gautama he had already accumu- lated such religious merit that he could for example choose by himself into which family he will be born (see Bareau 1962; 1963; 1974b; 1980). Although the belief that in distant past six other buddhas had preceded Gautama may not have belonged to the earliest tradition, it must predate the split of the various schools, as the names of the six buddhas are identical in the texts of the various schools. After the Sattra period, the number of the previous buddhas was increased into 24 (e.g. in the Buddhavanisa and the Cariyapitaka). In the Satras, it is not yet implied that all beings can strive for buddhahood; the career of a bodhi- sattva (buddha-to-be) is first presented as an alternative for the ideal of an enlightened disciple (arhat) in the Sarvastivadin Avadana literature (Dtghanikaya II 225; Thomas 1971:167-168; Foucher 1949:148). In Mahayana, the idea of the bodhisattva career was then followed by the idea of a "Tathagata embryo" or "womb of the Tathagata" (tathagatagarbha), inherent in all beings (Ruegg 1969:31-32). This idea can be understood in three different ways: 1) All beings are the in- terior ("womb") of Tathagata; 2) Tathagata is identical with the inner essence ("embryo") of all living beings; 3) the inner essence of living beings is the "embryo" of the Tathagata (e.g. the Ratnagotravibhaga; see Ruegg 1969; Pyysiainen 1993:108-110; King 1991:48-56). The tathdgatagarbha idea is closely related to the idea of a "Buddha nature" (Chinese fo xing, Japanese busshi). The idea that all sentient beings possess the Buddha nature was appropriated by the four major indigenous schools of Chinese Buddhism, and was then transmitted to other East Asian schools of Buddhism. The Sanskrit equivalent of the Chinese fo xing has been much debated, but now buddhadhdtu is rather generally agreed upon. This doctrine holds that all sentient be- ings already are buddhalike; they just do not realize it. Buddha nature thus is understood both as the potential to realize buddhahood, and that buddhahood itself (King 1991). Without entering the subtleties of Mahayana doctrine, I merely want to point out that there is a diver- sity of opinions on the constituents of buddhahood and its relationship</page><page sequence="8">154 Ilkka Pyysidinen with other important metaphysical terms. That some kind of buddha- hood exists, is beyond doubt; it is only its conceptual formulations that vary. In many Mahayana treatises such most basic concepts as "bud- dhahood" and nirvana are even said to be mere "words and signs" and thus not to correspond to the Ultimate Truth (paramartha satya) (see Pyysiiiinen 1993:104-124). That has never meant that Buddhist practice would have been given up as unnecessary for spiritual devel- opment, though (see Sharf 1995). Although the conceptions regarding the Buddha's nirvana or "en- lightenment" are in this sense vague, they are, of course, of primary importance in defining what makes the Buddha and the buddhas some- thing unique. The Buddha is a "perfectly enlightened one"; he is also enlightened by himself (unlike his disciples), and wants to lead oth- ers to enlightenment (unlike the paccekabuddhas, "solitary buddhas"). Whatever nirvana and perfect enlightenment are, they characterize the buddhas. The traditions picture the Buddha as having found a com- pletely novel way to "liberation," without unequivocally explaining what it actually consisted of (see Majjhimanikaya I 163-166, 240- 247; II 212). After his "enlightenment" the Buddha approached the five ascetics, with whom he had practised austerities, and replied to their greetings: "Monks, do not address Tathagata by name and by the word 'friend.' Monks, Tathagata is an arahat, a perfectly enlight- ened one. Listen, o monks, deathless has been found, I will instruct you, I will teach dhamma." (Vinayapitakah I 8-10). Gautama had be- come a "buddha," whatever that was understood to mean. The impor- tant thing here is that it is possible for the Buddhist to have the belief about the uniqueness of the Buddha and the buddhas without having discursive beliefs about the precise nature of this uniqueness; the idea of a Buddha-essence can be used as a premise in reasoning without that the nature of the essence is specified (see Ahn et al. 2001). Counter-intuitiveness In the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha and the buddhas are un- equivocally distinguished from the devas ('gods'). It is, however, to be noticed that the devas are understood very differently than what</page><page sequence="9">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 155 God is in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions, despite the fact that etymologically deva is related to the Latin deus. Both derive from *deivos ('shining, sky'). (The English equivalent of deus, 'god,' de- rives from the Indo-European ghu-, 'to call, invoke.') In denying that the Buddha was a god, the early Buddhists were not of course deny- ing the Judeo-Christian God; this idea was not even known to them. Instead, they were denying the then current ideas of devas and fsvaras ('Lords') (see NMgarjuna's IRvarakartrtvanirakrtih). In contrast to the Brahmanic gods, the Buddha was a human being that then became a buddha (whatever it means). Yet in many of the somewhat later texts he is more like a heavenly being that became a man, than the other way around (see Pyysiiinen 1993:144). In a sense, the Buddha, indeed, oc- cupies in the Buddhist belief environment a similar position as God in the Judeo-Christian beliefs. I shall return to this soon. To the extent that the Buddha and the buddhas are beings sui generis and thus differ from human beings, we should be able to specify what is it that makes them different from humans. I suggest that the recent the- orizing by Pascal Boyer (1994a, b; 1996; 2000a, b; 2001) offers good means of reconceptualizing the relationships between buddhas, gods, and human beings (see Pyysiainen 2001:9-23). Boyer has adopted Fred Sommers' (1959) "ontological tree" and Frank Keil's (1979) way of employing this idea in empirical work as the starting point in devel- oping his ideas of "intuitive ontology" and such counter-intuitive vio- lations against it as is commonly found in religions. Sommers (1959) argues that ontological distinctions are manifested as predicate restric- tions: any given term can have only certain kinds of predicates; thus, knowing some of these allows us to predict what other predicates are applicable. Keil (1979; 1996), for his part, has done experimental re- search on the evolution of ontological distinctions in small children. His results by and large seem to confirm Sommers' suggestions, al- though the categories used are slightly different. Even preschoolers are capable of mentally representing ontological distinctions; this, how- ever, is intuitive knowledge: the subjects are not necessarily aware of having it, and cannot always conceptualize it. Yet they are, for exam- ple, able to predict the applicability of various kinds of predicates: if</page><page sequence="10">156 Ilkka Pyysidinen something can cry, then it can also be tired; if it is made of metal, it can also be fixed, and so on, even when the subjects do not know what this something is. The ontological status of a given term is inferred from its use, and once it is inferred, it can be used in an appropriate manner. The insights of Sommers and Keil can be enriched by arguments about the modularity, or domain-specificity, of the human mind, de- veloped in evolutionary psychology and cognitive science (e.g. Atran 1990; Tooby and Cosmides 1995; Cosmides and Tooby 1994; Karmi- loff-Smith 1992; Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994b; Sperber 1994; 1996; Mithen 1998). It is on this basis that Boyer has developed the idea of "intuitive ontology," i.e. tacit, intuitive knowledge concerning the divi- sion of objects into certain basic ontological categories, together with the corresponding mechanisms of reasoning. Boyer argues that there are certain evolved mechanisms that are somehow genetically encoded and are bound to appear when a subject matures in normal conditions. Contextual factors thus play a role in cognitive development, although development is genetically coded. Boyer has presented slightly varying lists of the intuitive ontological categories. When referring to Keil's work, he writes that "ontological categories like ABSTRACT OBJECT, LIVING THING, ANIMAL, EVENT, and so on are arranged in a taxonomical tree according to precise formal constraints" (Boyer 1994b:101). In his 1996 paper, he says: "Let me first consider ontological distinctions between such domains as PERSONS, ARTIFACTS, ANIMATE BEINGS, EVENTS and ABSTRACT OBJECTS" (Boyer 1996:84). And, again, "Intuitive ontology comprises 'naive theories' of broad domains such as PERSON, ANIMAL, PLANT, or ARTIFACT" (Boyer 1998:878). Later, he writes, referring to his earlier work, "Indeed, a 'catalogue' that uses only the categories of person, animal and artefact and includes only breaches of physical and cognitive properties associated with those categories virtually exhausts cultural variation in this domain (Boyer 1996; 1998)" (Boyer 2000a:103). In yet another paper, Boyer (2000b:198) distinguishes between PERSONS, ANIMALS, PLANTS, ARTIFACTS, and NATURAL OBJECTS. Barrett (2000), referring to Boyer (2000a), distinguishes persons, animals, plants, artifacts, and natural non-living things.</page><page sequence="11">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 157 Whatever the most basic division is, and how it is enriched in maturation, the important thing is that it forms the natural basis of the counter-intuitive representations of various religious traditions. "Counter-intuitiveness" is a technical term referring to violations against intuitive expectations about ontological categories; therefore, "counter-ontological" may have been a better choice than "counter- intuitive," as (Boyer 2001:65) recently has remarked. It is important to realize we are here talking about violations of non-conscious, intuitive expectations, not of explicitly held views, theories, or "worldviews." "Counter-intuitive" also does not mean funny, strange, or untrue; it only means something that contradicts panhuman intuitive expecta- tions of how entities behave. These expectations can be violated either by transferring to a representation a property it intuitively should not have, or by denying to it a property it intuitively should have. Thus are formed for example the ideas of personal beings without a body (gods, spirits, etc). and of various kinds of artifacts that have psycho- logical properties (e.g. a statue that hears prayers). On this basis, we are, in principle, able to construct a "catalogue of the supernatural," i.e. to create by a simple cross-tabulation a list of the various pos- sible forms counter-intuitive representations (Boyer 1994a, b; 2000a; 2000b:196-199; 2001:61-71; Barrett 2000). According to Boyer, such counter-intuitive representations constitute the category of "religious ideas," and concepts that merely confirm intuitive ontologies are ipso facto nonreligious, although counter-intuitiveness as such is not a suffi- cient criterion for religion (Boyer 1994a:408; 1994b: 122, 124; see also Atran 1996:234; 1998; PyysiBainen 2001:197-236). It is their counter-intuitiveness that makes religious concepts inter- esting and attention-grabbing; it is their intuitive properties that make it possible to make inferences from them. Thus, in oral transmission, it is their optimal counter-intuitiveness that gives religious concepts and beliefs an advantage in cultural selection. They contain one salient violation of intuitive expectations, while in other aspects they remain intuitive; therefore they have such inferential potential that makes them useful from an everyday point of view. For example, a statue that hears prayers only involves one violation of expectations: a physical object</page><page sequence="12">158 Ilkka Pyysidinen that hears. A statue that hears prayers from a 100 miles distance is too complicated an idea and therefore unlikely to survive in cultural trans- mission, without getting simplified (Boyer 1994b: 113-119; 2001:61- 89; Barrett and Nyhof 2001). Therefore, we do not find in folk tra- ditions representations such as "(a) cat that can never die, has wings, is made of steel, experiences time backwards, lives underwater, and speaks Russian" (Barrett 1998:611). In religious representations, violations of biological expectations most often relate to birth and death: gods, saints, etc. are born in some unusual way, and also their death either involves something extraor- dinary, or they do not actually die at all. Among other biological vio- lations of expectations are extraordinary size and other bodily abnor- malities, a body that radiates light, etc. Violations of intuitive physics include, for example, various kinds of miraculous deeds: walking upon the water, clairvoyance, invisibility, etc. Counter-intuitive psychology, for its part, includes phenomena such as omniscience, mind-reading, etc. In many instances, the violation concerns at once two or all three of these domains (see Loomis 1948; Thompson 1955-59; Pyysiiinen 2002b). It is also to be noted that finding counter-intuitiveness in reli- gious representations does not mean to say anything about the truth or meaning of these representations; in this respect various interpretative possibilities remain open. I suggest that representations of the Buddha and the buddhas are different from representations of humans in the sense that they involve counter-intuitive elements. Yet they are at the same time also similar to representations of humans in the sense that they include the folk- psychological idea of an agent characterized by a belief-and-desire psychology (with some non-standard elements in it). This, however, also means that representations of the Buddha and the buddhas have much in common with representations of gods: both are counter- intuitive agents. I shall not consider the various fictive buddhas and bodhisattvas, as their "superhumanity" is in any case so obvious. This view explains our intuitive understanding of Buddhism as a re- ligion, as well as the conception that the Buddha and the buddhas in some sense belong to the same category as gods. It is the formal prop-</page><page sequence="13">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 159 erty of being counter-intuitive that allows us to classify the Buddha and the buddhas together with gods; the specific content of representa- tions of the Buddha and the buddhas differentiate them from represen- tations of gods. Counter-intuitive representations also can be put into different kinds of uses. It seems to me that representations of the Bud- dha and the buddhas partly serve similar functions as representations of God in the Judeo-Christian traditions, some important differences notwithstanding. In the following, I first provide a few examples of the counter-intuitive properties of the Buddha and the buddhas; after that, I briefly discuss the functions of representations of the Buddha and the buddhas. Finally, I comment on the possibility of a globally valid concept of religion. Counter-intuitive properties of the Buddha and the buddhas The representations of the Buddha and the buddhas involve many kinds of violations of intuitive expectations. As it is not always possible to disentangle biological from the physical, or even from the psychological, I shall give examples of the Buddha's and the buddhas' counter-intuitive properties, without trying to classify them. Yet it is clear that all of the three categories discussed above are involved in the counter-intuitive representation of the Buddha and the buddhas. As to the birth of the Buddha, he is reported to have resided in the heaven of the happy gods, before choosing by himself into which family to be born, and before descending into the womb of his mother. The mother then in due course became pregnant, without intercourse with her husband (Majjhimanikaya III 119-124; Dfghanikaya II 12- 15). In the later sources, her dream about the bodhisattva entering (or coming out from) her womb through her right side in the form of a white elephant, without piercing her side, is described as something that actually happened. In for example the Mahavastu, the bodhisattva is said to be born virginally on the strength of his own karmic merit and to have come down from heaven to earth in order to enlighten men who have become blind (Mahavastu I 77-78, 113-115, 134). He is born in a "mind-made" body (manomayakaya) from the right side of his mother, yet without piercing that side (Mahdvastu I 117-118, 174;</page><page sequence="14">160 Ilkka Pyysidinen II 18). The Buddha thus no longer is a man who became buddha, but a buddha who became man. The Buddha's death also involves counter-intuitive imagery. Before his death, the Buddha's skin is reported to have become somehow ra- diant; the Buddha then explained that this was always so when a bud- dha was enlightened or was about to enter parinirvana (DTghanikaya II 133-134). His death is also described as having been accompanied by an earthquake (DTghanikaya II 156). Finally, the Buddha is reported never to have answered the question of where he will be after his death, which may or may not count as a violation of intuitive expectations (cf. Bering and Bjorklund 2002). According to the Buddhist tradition, nirvana does not mean simple annihilation; this view has then lead to the problem of what happens after an enlightened one dies and is not reborn. This question is never given a clear answer in Buddhist texts (see Majjhimanikaya I 136-138; Mahapraji~paramita~Sistra, p. 155 Lamotte). On the other hand, after his death, the Buddha is believed to be present in his relics (see above). Buddhas also are believed to appear in different forms or bod- ies, such as "the body of own essence" (svcbhivikakiya), "the body of enjoyment" (sambhogakaya), and "the apparitional body" (nirma- nakaya), described in Mahayana sources (e.g. Ratnagotravibhaga, pp. 289-290, 324; Mahayanasamgraha X 1). The body of own es- sence is the indivisible and uncompounded (asamskrta), inconceiv- able Dharma-body, the Buddhist "Absolute." The body of enjoyment is a "magical" outflow (nisyanda) of the Dharma-body and manifests Dharma for the benefit of living beings. The apparitional bodies are the bodies of the various historical buddhas. In this way the Buddha ap- pears in various forms, without ever being separated from the Dharma- body (Ratnagotravibhaga, pp. 326-331; Mahayanasarigraha X 1, X 6). Asafiga for example writes that, although the body of enjoy- ment and the apparitional body are transitory, the Tathagata's body (Tathagatakaya) is eternal because the other two bodies lean on the Dharma-body, and joy and apparitions never cease (Mahayana- samgraha X 37) (see Pyysiainen 1993:132-137; Lamotte 1958:689- 690).</page><page sequence="15">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 161 The Buddha is also said to have the 32 major and 80 minor marks that characterize the mythical Great Kings (the cakravartins) as well as buddhas. The marks include, for example, thousand-spoked wheel figures on the soles of feet, webbed fingers and toes, penis in a sheath, jaws like a lion's, 40 teeth, etc. (Dighanikaya III 142-145). This list probably derives from old Indian folk religion, and may also have been modified according to what was seen in the statues of Buddha made in northwestern India around the beginning of the Common era (Thomas 1975:220-222; Lamotte 1958:479-486; Bareau 1969:13). The Buddha also is reported to have had paranormal abilities and to have performed miracles, although he is said to have emphasized that one should not boast with paranormal abilities. In addition to the six traditional abhiifi"a (see above), he is for example recounted to have crossed the river miraculously, without a ferry (Dighanikaya II 183-98). The Mahavastu of the Lokottaravada school ("transcendentalists"), for its part, teaches that the buddhas are otherworldly (lokottara). "There is nothing in the Buddhas that can be measured by the standard of the world, but everything appertaining to the great seers is transcendent (lokottara)" (Mahdvastu I 125). Representations of the Buddha and the buddhas thus in many ways violate against ordinary ontological expectations, yet retaining the ker- nel of the intuitive belief-and-desire psychology. Not only biological and physical but also psychological expectations are violated: the Bud- dha and the buddhas are not constrained by ordinary lawful biologi- cal and physical processes, and also their minds work in non-standard ways. Although the Buddha was a human being, the followers' rep- resentations of him have, in the course of time, gradually grown ever more counter-intuitive. Representations of the Buddha and the buddhas include both coun- ter-intuitive, intuitive and normal, and odd but not counter-intuitive features. The way they combine goes against Boyer's idea of a cog- nitive optimum: there is not only one violation of biology or physics, but several, and this is so also with regard to psychology. This might be explained by the fact that the optimum only concerns orally trans- mitted folk traditions where constraints of memory play a role (see</page><page sequence="16">162 Ilkka Pyysidinen Rubin 1997). Mnemonic techniques of specialists, and especially the introduction of writing, make it possible to store and to transmit radi- cally counter-intuitive ideas that in spontaneous, ordinary transmission would either be lost or transformed into a simpler form (see Sperber 1996:74; Pyysidinen 1999). This line of reasoning has the consequence that, as long as the Buddhist tradition was transmitted orally, the Bud- dha must have been represented in simpler ways than what is the case in the later, written sources. He was not necessarily represented by em- ploying purely intuitive concepts; all that can be predicted is that his counter-intuitive properties (if such there were) were simple. So, one reason for why the later texts picture the Buddha in more radically counter-intuitive terms is that earlier, in the oral transmission of the tradition, this was not yet possible. Buddha, God, and religion The category of counter-intuitive agents is wide and varied. Gods are only one example of counter-intuitive beings. To the extent that it is at all possible to form a coherent category of gods, I suggest that gods play the role of "interested parties" in human social life (Boyer 2001:189). They know and understand everything that humans do and think, are interested in it, and also are believed to intervene in human activities, punishing and rewarding us according to our deeds. They thus are like any person with power, except for the fact that they have counter-intuitive properties. Besides, representations of gods are used in conceptualizing and explaining such human knowledge, dispositions, and preferences, which are otherwise difficult to understand. Our moral knowledge, for example, partly consists of panhuman preferences and inclinations encoded in our minds in evolution. It is, however, cognitively easier for us to consider our moral intuitions as someone's viewpoint; this someone is a god. Ascribing moral ideas to a divine mind both explains these ideas (their existence and their binding nature) and makes it easier for us to process moral knowledge in the mind (see Boyer 2001:169-202; Pyysiainen 2001:158-193).</page><page sequence="17">Buddhism, Religion, and the Concept of "God" 163 As Boyer (2001:170-174) points out, the relationship between religion and morality can be understood in three complementary ways: besides the interested party model, morality can also be conceived of as sets of commands laid down by the gods, or as based on the example of exemplary beings, be they bodhisattvas or saints. In practice, it is the interested party model that is most widely employed. What is true of morality also holds for many other aspects of social life; gods are an inevitable part of it. Various aspects of the social life are understood, explained, and mentally represented by employing the ideas of gods (see Boyer 2001; cf. Durkheim 1965). By reconceptualizing gods as "counter-intuitive agents," we arrive at a precise, theoretically motivated, and empirically testable concept. In this view, religion is typified by the presence of representations (mental and public) of counter-intuitive agents, which are taken seriously by the group in question and are used in the organization of social life as well as in personal life management. Here I have not, however, been concerned with a detailed explication of this idea (see Pyysidiinen 2001; 2002a); instead, I have only wanted to show that the Buddha and the buddhas most clearly belong to the category of counter-intuitive beings, and that Buddhism thus need not be problematic with regard to a global concept of religion, not even when only considered in the light of its written sources.
