<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes United States trying to return artifacts from Guatemala New York/Boston (The New York Times/The Boston Globe). In January 1998 26 Precolumbian stone and ceramic artifacts from the Peten Lowlands and the southern Guatema lan coast were brought inside suitcases to Miami by two persons who described the artifacts on Customs forms as "30 artifacts and two books packed into 10 boxes." Because no required official permission from the Guatemalan government to take them out of the country existed, U.S. Customs agents promptly seized the artifacts as cultural patrimony of Guate mala. The collection of pottery and figurines, dated between 500 and 1200 A.D. and valued at $165,000, was then taken to a vault in the basement of Customs' headquarters inside the World Trade Center. The pieces survived the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and were found months afterward by crews sifting through the rubble. They are now in a Miami warehouse. No information was given why the artifacts remained stored in New York for so long. With the intent of returning them to Guatemala the American Justice Depart ment took the first steps toward legally taking ownership of the artifacts recently, but the two importers who have not been charged yet by prosecutors have hired attorneys to fight to keep the pieces in the United States. A conclusion has not yet been reached. Alleged evidence for Olmec origins of Mesoamerican writing New York/Washington d.c. (New York Times/Science). At the end of last year a team of archaeologists led by Mary E. Pohl of Florida State University in Tallahassee discovered near the Olmec centre of La Venta, Tabasco, Mexico, a cylinder seal and fragments of a carved greenstone plaque bearing glyphs. These artifacts date to c. 650 B.C. and therefore predate other known examples of early Meso american writing for more than 300 years. According to Mary E. Pohl, Kevin O. Pope of Geo Eco Arc Research, Aquasco, and Christopher von Nagy of Tulane University, New Orleans, who have discussed this important finding in a recent article (see: Science, Vol. 298, Number 5600, Issue of 6 December 2002, pp. 1985-1987) the artifacts reveal that key aspects of early script were already present in Olmec writing: the combination of pictographic and glyphic ele ments to represent speech, the use of the sacred 260-day calendar, and the connection between writing, the calendar, and kingship. The authors suggest that Mesoamerican writing originated in the polity of La Venta. Among specialists this interpretation has been discussed controversially. While some scholars reacted to the new findings with excitement, others reacted with justifiable cau tion, questioning the glyphic elements as examples of true writing, as opposed to iconography. Michael D. Coe of Yale University, for example, stated that until much more evidence of Olmec writing was uncovered this interpretation would remain speculative. The image on the cylinder seal, which has the size of a human fist and apparently was used as a roller stamp, shows a bird. Two glyphs emanate from the bird's beak, suggesting speech scrolls. The authors of the Science article interpret the glyphs as 3 Ajaw and "King". 3 Ajaw is known as a day in the sacred calendar and could also have functioned in this context as the personal name of a king. In their report Pohl, Pope and von Nagy attempted to identify other glyphs on fragments of the plaque that was found in refuse deposits at the site of San Andres, three miles from La Venta. Xipe Totee statue found in situ in El Salvador San Salvador/Berkeley (Paul E. Amaroli/Karen Olsen Bruhns). Life- to near life-sized ceramic statues of the Mexi can deity Xipe Totee appear in the early Postclassic through out Mexico and Mexican influenced areas. Although a fair number of these statues are known, only three have had good provenience data: the Mazapan Phase (Early Postclassic) statue excavated by Sigvald Linné in 1934 in the ruins of a structure above the Xolalpan Palace in Teotihuacan, an Early Postclassic statue excavated by Manuel Torres in Veracruz at Piedras Negras (also known as Madereros) near Cerro de las Mesas, and, more recently, a Postclassic statue found with another, of an anthropomorphic bat deity, in Tezoquipan, in Central Mexico. However, in the early months of 2002 an additional statue of Xipe was found in central El Salvador. The archaeological site of Carranza is located approxi mately 1 km south of the large urban site of Cihuatan, of which it may have been a suburb. The site is located on the floor of the Acelhuate Valley and all but two of its structures have been destroyed by agricultural activities, mainly the mexicon • Vol. XXV • Februar 2003</page><page sequence="2">1^%?; Fig. 9. Excavation of Structure 1, Carranza. planting of sugar cane. On a visit to the site in 2001, Dr. Rodrigo Brito picked up several sherds of what was evidently the body of a large, hollow Xipe statue. Other sherds of Tohil Plumbate suggested an Early Postclassic (Guazapa Phase) date for this group of (originally) more than ten platforms. Accordingly, a rescue operation, sponsored by the Fundación National de Arqueología de El Salvador (FUNDAR) and directed by Paul E. Amaroli, was carried out after the cane was harvested. Six weeks of excavation, interrupted by an assault by armed robbers which resulted in the loss of all the excavation and survey equipment, were carried out on Struc ture 1, where the Xipe sherds had been found. Structure 1 was in an amazingly good state of preservation, given that it had been under cultivation for nearly 4 decades (Fig. 9). The platform is oriented to 14° azimuth (from geographic north). Constructed of large cobbles and earth, it originally stood about 80 cm in height. The platform was faced with slabs of pumice and tuff, including two slabs with carved designs, one a circle and dot, the other a spiral. Both designs are associated with Mexican depictions of Xipe. A stair on the south side of the platform shows two stages of construction and was Ca«arv # © Vi ,^\pe"f^eC s\aWe ua9^e^S " \ Fig. 10. Plan of the Xipe Temple at Carranza. bordered by balustrades with the typical Early Postclassic proportions of talud/tablero. A fragment of a bifacially worked large chert knife was found on the stairs. The surface of the platform has a fill of white volcanic ash, perhaps the remains of a damaged floor. On the north side of the platform top were three rooms defined by their wide stone foundations, the walls probably having been of adobe, now destroyed, but suggested by the masses of a distinctive sandy clay earth (like that still used to form adobe bricks) found around the bases of the foundations and upon the contempo rary soil surface around the platform itself. Almost all of the fragments of Xipe were recovered from the centre room at a very shallow depth (between surface and 25 cm) (Fig. 10). Some of the sherds had been moved about by plowing, but the majority appeared to be in their original positions, piled on top of each other. Most were large frag ments, ranging from about 10 to 30 cm in length. There was no evidence that they had been buried, as would have been the case if this was a ritual offering. It appears very much like the statue was in its original position in the centre room when it was destroyed, along with Structure 1. Like the buildings studied thus far at Cihuatan, this structure was burned and its incense burners and other materials associated with it were smashed. A number of arrow and lance points were found associated with the broken pottery and burned earth on top of and around Structure 1. A significant portion of the statue was recovered, enabling us to see that the hollow statue was made in three separate parts: the head, the chest and arms, and the lower body and legs (Fig. 11). Originally it must have stood between 1 m and 1.5 m high. The skin of the sacrificed victim which Xipe wears is represented by appliquéd scales. Many of these retain their original yellow paint.

This piece preserves some of the original yellow paint. 11 mexicon • Vol. XXV • Februar 2003</page><page sequence="3">12 Preliminary analysis of the ceramics associated with It may be noted that the figure represented on a roughly Carranza Structure 1 enable us to say with certainty that the contemporaneous plaque found at Ixtapaluca, in the Chalco building and its contents pertain to the Early Postclassic region of the Basin of Mexico, and wearing both a pectoral Guazapa Phase, although we have few (and largely unreli- with the 7 Reptile Eye glyph and a monster maw headdress able) C14 dates for this phase.

Apparently this situation persisted up to the Late The Xochicalco stelae, Quetzalcoatl and Postclassic, since Durán (1995, II: 74, Chapter 7), describing Venus, revisited the temple of Quetzalcoatl, mentions that the drums dedi Ljubluana (Ivan Sprajc). The meaning of the stelae of cated to Ehecatl were beaten at sunset; it thus seems that, Xochicalco, subject of a number of studies, still defies a while Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli ruled the dawn, Ehecatl was thorough and compelling interpretation. Manuel Aguilar's "lord of the evening twilight" (López Austin 1994: 26). paper recently published in mexicon (2002) represents a Following another line of reasoning, we can recall that, new attempt to solve the problem. Elaborating on Sáenz's according to Klein (1976: 85ff, 97), the gods of Venus in its (1964) and Piña Chan's (1977: 32ff) arguments, the author morning manifestation are never depicted en face, because views the iconographic content of the stelae as a mythological this is a characteristic of the deities associated with the earth; narrative concerned with the god Quetzalcoatl and the planet frontal representations, such as those found at Tula, Chichen Venus. In response to his hope "to generate discussion and Itza and Xochicalco, may thus refer exclusively to the evening, motivate further research on the topic" (p. 133), I wish to call earth-related aspect of the planet.

However, the emerging from the gaping maw of a serpent or reptilian concept of nocturnal sun merged with the evening aspect of monster. Seler (1960-61, vol. 1:692ff) identified comparable Venus, and both were related to the rain god (Klein 1976:97; motifs at Postclassic Chichen Itza with Kukulcan or 1980; Sprajc 1993a: 38; 1996a: 61). The personages on the Quetzalcoatl and, considering the transformation of this god stelae may thus well refer also to Venus, but not to the to the morning star reported in the Contact-period sources, morning star. This is suggested not only by the above men related them specifically to the morning aspect of Venus, tioned evidence but also by the date 4 Olin on Stela 3. The Extending Seler's argument and comparing the figures on feathered serpent carved on a monolith from Maltrata, Xochicalco Stelae 1 and 3 with similar icons represented in Veracruz, Mexico, has a star symbol attached to the body, and Tula, Sáenz (1964: 7If) and Piña (1977: 32ff) identified is accompanied by the 4 Olin glyph (Baird 1989: Fig. 39), them with Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, Venus as morning star, indicating that this date was somehow associated with and Aguilar essentially follows their interpretation. He adds Quetzalcoatl and Venus. However, its specific referent could that, according to the Anales de Cuauhtitlan, Quetzalcoatl not have been the morning aspect of the planet: according created the first men on a day 7 Ehecatl, and concludes that to the Codex Vaticanus A, 4 Olin was the date of Quetzal the main personage on Stela 1 associated with the date 7 coatl's disappearance in the Red Sea, but in Vaticanus B Reptile Eye, corresponding to 7 Ehecatl, is "Quetzalcoatl this is a name of Xolotl (Caso 1967:197). The two gods were as Venus the morning star (Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli)" (Aguilar closely related, but Xolotl, specifically, was clearly associ 2002: 134). Vol. XXV • Februar 2003</page><page sequence="4">ated with Venus as evening star (Seler 1960-61, vol. Ill: 392-409; Brundage 1982: 208ff; Sprajc 1993a: 29f; 1996a: 47f; 1996b: 89). Consequently, Stela 3, too, may represent a deity comparable to the later Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl (or a fusion of both), but if a specific aspect of Venus is also implied, it must have been the evening star. It is worth adding that neither on the stelae nor on any other monument of Xochicalco do we find a glyph representing 1 Acatl, which in later periods was the characteristic calendrical name of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the morning manifestation of Venus. Other Sonographie and glyphic data that Aguilar inter prets as references to the morning and evening visibility periods of Venus are far from being explicit and may well have different explanations. For example, the author argues that the left lateral face of Stela 1 (side D) refers to the evening star visibility period, which is supposed to be implied by two 7 Tochtli glyphs delimiting a 260-day interval (Aguilar 2002: 135). The average duration of both the morning and the evening star visibility periods is, indeed, close to 260 days, but if such had been the purpose underlying these glyphs, one would expect to find other records of character istic Venus intervals on the same stela; however, the glyphs on the other faces, which Aguilar associates with the morning star period, are spaced at intervals that have no apparent connection with the Venus cycle. In sum, one may agree that Quetzalcoatl, or some ances tral version of this god, is represented on the stelae of Xochicalco. The evidence discussed above suggests that the planet Venus is also involved, particularly its evening mani festation, but many details of the iconographic and glyphic narrative remain, in my opinion, obscure.
