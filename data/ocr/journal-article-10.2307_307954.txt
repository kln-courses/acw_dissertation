<plain_text><page sequence="1">Slavic and East European Journal THROUGH THE EYES OF THE CHILD: THE ARTISTIC VISION OF ELENA GURO Vera Kalina-Levine, New York City In his reminiscence about Elena Guro, Vasilij Kamenskij links Guro's poetry with a tragic event in her life, the loss of her only child. Unable to come to terms with her son's death, Guro, in Kamenskij's recollection, went on imagining her son was alive and continued to buy toys for him, maintain his room, draw his portraits, and write stories and poems for him.' Although both the emphasis on biographical roots of a poet's imagination in general and Kamenskij's reminiscences in particular have to be taken cum grano salis,2 it is striking that as both a poet and a painter Guro was almost obsessively preoccupied with the world of the child. As a poetic persona, she frequently identifies with children or at least expresses her strong empathy with them by assuming a maternal stance toward life. She further confounds the issue of her parentage when she states in one of the prose sketches in Baby Camels in the Sky (Nebesnye verbljuzata): "You see, I have no children, may be that's why I love so unbearably everything that is alive. Sometimes it seems to me that I am a mother to everything" (121). While there is uncertainty with respect to Guro's status as a parent, it is a noteworthy detail of her family background that her grandfather on her mother's side was the well-known pedagogue Cistjakov, who both wrote stories for children and was the publisher of A Children's Journal (Zurnal dlja detej) in the years 1851-1865.3 But whatever the specifics of their ostensible bio- graphical underpinnings, Guro's creative interests were also clearly grounded in some of the most important trends and assumptions which gained momentum in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, the period that nurtured Guro's literary and artistic sensibilities. One such trend was primitivism which, at the time Guro entered the literary scene in Russia, fostered an idealization of childhood and sought to legitimize its world not only in literature but also in art, psychology, philosophy, political thought, and the law.4 30 SEEJ, Vol. 25, No. 2 (1981)</page><page sequence="2">The Artistic Vision of Elena Guro 31 In literature, the glorification of childhood provided a broadly based impetus for what became a central concern of the Russian Futurists, namely their endeavor to renovate language. By the time Elena Guro developed an abiding interest in the incipient Futurist or rather, Cubo- Futurist cause, heralded by the miscellany A Trap for Judges I (Sadok Sudej I) in April 1910, she had a number of published works to her credit. Most of these works were incorporated in the collection of prose, poetry, and plays entitled The Hurdy-Gurdy (Sarmanka), published in February 1909. To the extent that Guro's idealization of childhood was anticipated in her first book and as such predated her involvement with Futurism, it did not grow out of her endorsement of the Futurist demand to overthrow established forms and conventions so much as it converged with it. Within this perspective, it is pertinent that even before she turned to literature, Guro had expressed her interest in the world of the child in painting. In addition, in 1911 Guro planned to publish a book of fairy-tales, a project which, however, never came to fruition because her publisher lost both the literary material and its water-color illustra- tions.5 As far as her work as a painter is concerned, Guro not only treated fairy-tale subjects on canvas,6 but often used simple, child-like designs (-flowers, stars, trees, et cetera) in her book illustrations. Her friend, Olga MatjuSina was struck by the childish quality of Guro's drawings and watercolors: "A posthumous exhibit" ... Yet everything is alive in it: cheerful puppies run, make somersaults, delicate birches quiver, a cat pricks up its ears keenly ... Everything is painted with only a few lines, sparingly and expressively.7 Giving literary and artistic expression to her interest in the in- fantile world, Guro made a multifaceted contribution to what was a specifically modern version of primitivism, the growing cult of child- hood. This cult gained its forcefulness from the belief that childhood exemplified not only the most desirable human state but also the ideal artistic condition. Perceiving a fundamental similarity beween the child and the artist, Guro viewed childhood as encapsulating the natural artistry of mankind. Her identification of childhood with genu- ine artistry was not unlike that of Rainer Maria Rilke who wrote, shortly before his two influential trips to Russia, that the essence of artistry lay in child-like naivet6, unselfconsciousness, openness to and instinctive trust in life.8 For Guro, as for Rilke, emulation of the artistic sensibility of the child was not a mere return to the romantic ideal of the noble savage who had been praised for both his intuitive wisdom and keen sensitivity</page><page sequence="3">32 Slavic and East European Journal to beauty. Children in her eyes are born artists, endowed with unique perceptions in both life and art and with a predisposition for playfulness which she considers to be at the source of all creativity. Childhood for Guro epitomizes that stage in human development in which reality is not yet divided into fixed categories or ordered by the principle of causality. The child is a symbol of wholeness, free to connect outwardly unrelated phenomena and to intermix reality with fantasy. Fascinated with the world of childhood, Guro dedicated her oeuvre to exploring it from several perspectives. The child's vision not only colors the feelings and ideas conveyed in her works but also informs the techniques and devices that shape the presentation of their thematic material. Exploit- ing children's language and imagery, Guro captured both the symboli- zational mechanism and the freshness and immediacy of their experi- ences. In the process, she illuminated not only the rich fabric of the natural artistry of children but also aspects of creativity in the making. The original freshness of the infantile world and concomitantly, the identification of the child's perceptual experiences with artistry are at the center of Guro's attention as early as her debut work entitled "Early Spring" (Rannjaja vesna). Originally published in An Anthology of Young Writers (Sbornik molodyx pisatelej) in 1905, this story was later incorporated in Guro's book The Hurdy-Gurdy, under the title "Arrival in the Country" (Priezd v derevnju).9 The story is a recollection of infantile perceptions. It recapitulates the patterns by which a little girl orders and apprehends the world around her. This world is based not on causal relations but mostly on sensory happenstance. Patterns emerge from relationships of surface contiguity, as they are apprehended and related to one another by the senses rather than by the intellect. In her sensory approach to life, the child or the little girl in the story is a born impressionist who dwells on her impressions solely for their pleasurable if not esthetic value. Guro's insistence on pure sensory perception, unspoiled by thought and analysis, as well as her extreme concentration on trivia, are characteristic of literary impressionism as it was practiced in the late nineteenth century by, among others, Fet in poetry and Cexov in his short stories of the 1899-1903 period.10 Although the child's perceptions in "Arrival in the Country" are presented through the refraction of the adult persona, they preserve all their freshness and immediacy. But the persona is occasionally unable to hold back comments that point distinctly to her adult status in life, for instance: "We were then still blissfully unaware that everything is much more prosaic with adults, that they don't have the same feelings as children" (106). In spite of the few "authorial" comments from the adult perspective, however, most of the impressions captured in the</page><page sequence="4">The Artistic Vision of Elena Guro 33 story belong to the little girl; it is the temperament of the child that puts its stamp on or filters the captured moments. Rendering reality the way it appears to her pure and immediate perception, the little girl presents at times unrealistic pictures, based on sensory illusions rather than on facts. Thus, travelling on a train, she displaces the source of motion, observing: "In the window frame, strips of earth and sky rush by quickly" (100). Similarly, looking out of a moving carriage, it appeared to her that "the station huts swam back" (102). However, it is not only the absence of analytical knowledge but also her naivete and inexperi- ence that are at the source of the little girl's original vision. Capable of marvelling at even the most commonplace phenomena, she assigns nature a very special place in her scheme of life. Although she has little understanding of natural phenomena, she is intensely aware of their sensory qualities, as when, filled with delight, she wonders: "Oh, what smells with such dampness and warmth? ... What's that light-violet little thing along the ravine?" (103) However nature is not the only discovery that captivates the little girl. Ordinary language, the mere sounds of the most prosaic words seem to acquire new, almost myster- ious dimensions, as when she overhears a conversation of adults: "Delivery of gas tar to the farmstead, a brick factory . .-The novelty and delight from new, fresh words and names, not worn out with use and somewhat rough and hard, was being transmitted to us." (106). The child has a unique feeling and appreciation for language. However, it is not so much the referential meaning as the totality of language that appeals to the infantile imagination. The child's emphasis on language as an autonomous whole may even lead to a dislocation of meaning. In the story, the young protagonist confuses a sequence of events as she misinterprets like sounding words: roBopHna O KaKMX-TO Bbie3AaX. CTapUlyo ceCTpy &lt;&lt;BbIBO3MHM. &gt;&gt;I OT 3TOrO OHa Bce CTORUna npe~q 3epKanoM, KpyroM cyeTMrlaCb cpaHI4y)KeHKa; a Hac yBOHnJ Ba eTCKy1o. (99) She talked about some departures /introductions to society/. The eldest sister was "to part" /to be brought out/. And from this she kept standing before a mirror, the French girl fussed around and we were taken to the nursery. The event that holds all the impressions together is a move to the country. This event is filled with excitement not only because the idea of it is novel and unexpected but also because the very experience of the journey is a source of an unprecedented wealth of impressions. It leads to a "newly discovered land" which is to be explored in all its sensuousness and with all the senses. In her unquenchable thirst for new perceptions, the little girl deems no color, sound, shape, or scent too trivial to notice.</page><page sequence="5">34 Slavic and East European Journal The child's confrontation with reality takes place mostly on the physical or sensual level. Even her apprehension of time is marked by concrete- ness; her awareness of the future derives from such specific actions as the covering up of furniture in preparation for the summer: "We partici- pated in the preparation of the future, in tidying up the apartment" (99). The little girl's life unfolds in an indistinct flow of time, interrupted by only a few special events such as, Christmas or a trip to the country: "From time to time, in the dark and narrow nursery, among endless Mondays and Tuesdays, in the color of ordinary boredom, there opened up pleasantly trembling windows from which a holiday could come" (97). Her vague awareness of temporality derives from these holidays which act as signposts in the passage of time. Their arrival is antici- pated with great impatience and their proximity calculated by focusing on fixed events in life: We liked to while away the time until the set date; wake up in the morning with an impatiently pleasant awareness: one more day gone by and another has arrived; and there's reason to hurry and live it through faster (98). Unable to consciously reckon time, the little girl views sleeping as an indicator that yet another day has elapsed. But if such attitude points to a distinctively infantile conception of time, the little girl's childishness is also reflected in her underlying egocentrism, apparent in her remark that the earth was "disobedient" as it "rocked, pushed and collapsed" under her feet. Connected with the girl's egocentric view of the world or even its direct corollary, is her tendency to animate inanimate objects. Things literally live for the sake of the little girl, and the world is nothing but an extension of her feelings and perceptions. Here the impulse to capture the infantile vision is harmoniously meshed with the use of metonymy which is so characteristic of Guro's prose. 1 Unable to hold on to the multitude of feelings and perceptions, the little girl projects them or some striking parts and aspects of them into the surrounding world. There they are endowed with autonomous existence and as such function as the anthropomorphic reflections of the child's psyche, the psyche of an artist. It is interesting that some thirteen years after Guro wrote her "Arrival in the Country" Boris Pasternak turned his attention to por- traying the child as an artist in his story "The Childhood of Luvers." The similarity between Pasternak's story, particularly its first part entitled "The Long Days," and Guro's work is remarkable. Although psychologi- cally, philosophically, and structurally much more complex, Paster- nak's piece not only follows the basic plot outline but also uses some of the motifs and devices of"Arrival in the Country." Its very title captures</page><page sequence="6">The Artistic Vision of Elena Guro 35 the mood conveyed at the beginning of Guro's story. The long days for Zenja Luvers, as for the young protagonist in Guro's story, are times of loneliness and alienation from the incomprehensible and distant world of adults. The possibility for change and a glimpse of happiness arrive with Zenja's parents' decision to move to the country. Described at some length, the actual journey to the country gives rise to a multitude of fleeting impressions which undergo imaginative transformations in Zenja's inexperienced mind and as such attest to her innate artistic sensibility. Through Zenja-the child, Pasternak captures the very pro- cess of creativity, the original shaping of envisioned material, leading to what Tynjanov called "a turning of vision." Like Guro, Pasternak pre- sents his story as a recollection of childhood perceptions and experiences through the eyes of the adult persona. This persona is clearly a poet who uses densely poetic prose to capture the original vision of the child. There is no attempt to eliminate the distortions that result from the child's reliance on sensory perception rather than on facts. Like the little girl in Guro's story, Zenja attributes movement to the mountains she sees from the moving train: The mountainous panorama extended and kept on growing. Some were black, others were refreshed, some were obscured, others obscured. They came together and separated, they ascended and climbed down. All this moved in a sort of low circle, like the rotation of stars, with the prudent caution of giants anxious for the preservation of the earth, on the edge of catastrophe.12 As for all children, abstractions make no sense to Zenja. She grasps the meaning of abstract concepts by finding their analogy among con- crete, tangible phenomena. 13 Thus, she transposes the unfamiliar con- cept "frontier of Asia" into an "iron balustrade placed between the public and a cage full of pumas" (198). In both stories, language constitutes one of the most important discoveries of childhood. Its inherent psychological significance is underscored by Zenja's panic when she is unable to identify or put a linguistic construct on the occurence she sees in the distance. Once she learns its name, she feels comforted: The girl understood nothing and contentedly sucked at a falling tear. She wanted only one thing, to know the name of the unknowable-Motovilixa. That night it explained every- thing, for during the night the name still possessed a complete and reassuring significance for the child (180). The actual object behind the word "factory" is of less interest to Zenja than the label itself. For the child, the name of a thing does not signal mere recognition but represents the very essence of that thing., The</page><page sequence="7">36 Slavic and East European Journal ability to designate an object by its name represents its complete mastery and therefore the expunction of the terror believed to be inher- ent in the unknown. Just as the little girl in Guro's story, Zenja Luvers is not under the sway of the communicative aspect of language. As a result, she easily experiences displacement in meaning, as in the follow- ing: "Later something was said in French, in the language she knew well but in a language she could not understand."14 To the degree that language is connected with unique perceptions of the child, it is at the source of what Pasternak called the "poetic caprice" of childhood. As Zenja matures, her life becomes prose and is transformed into fact. Guro's interest in the child's unconventional use and understand- ing of language constitutes one of the most important points at which her primitivism converges with Futurism. Insofar as the child enjoys language qua language, independently of its referential or symbolic function, the child represents the prototype of the Futurist; he is the original champion of "the word as such." Indeed, the affinity between the child's inventive playfulness with language and the Futurist pur- suit of neologisms and even of zaum was recognized by such leading spokesman of the Futurist movement as Krutenyx and by such early Formalist critics as Sklovskij, Tynjanov, and others. The child's natural orientation toward language as such, language in its purely esthetic function, finds a particularly strong expression in children's folklore. It assumes an important role in children's play which, as Jan Mukatovsky pointed out, "is the foundation of a good part of children's folklore in which its procedures and results achieve stabilization. Here belong for instance children's counting-out rhymes which sometimes lead to an 'artificial speech,' consisting of words that have no relation to reality."15 But although children's play with language is essentially self-focused, it also conceals an underlying link with some practical, extra-esthetic purpose such as articulatory practice, mastery of the meaning associa- tions between phonetically similar words, and others.16 Guro's interest in the linguistic experience of children in general and her child-like predilection for phonetic innovation in particular is most clearly illustrated by the following poem entitled "Words of Love and Warmth" (Slova ljubvi i tepla) from her collection Baby Camels in the Sky: XMn 6bil BOTIK - )KBOTHK BOpKOTHK /ypaTMK KOTMK - nywaThK, flyuoH-HMK,</page><page sequence="8">The Artistic Vision of Elena Guro 37 BenoBaTMK, KouwypaTHK - floTaCHK... (120-121) Once upon a time there was/ Bootie-tummy/ Purly/ Dopey/ Kitty-fluffy/ Feathery/ Whitely/ Kit-catty/ Tussely... Built from parallel diminutives, the poem emphasizes the phonetic interplay rather than the commucative function of the separate words. All of the rhymed nouns can be viewed as a tightly knit chain of vowels and consonants, on the one hand resembling the teasing games that children play with names, for example, MiSka-SiSka, MaSa-kaga (Botik, from Bot, was the name of one of Guro's cats), and on the other hand, not unlike the pure sound games mentioned by Roman Jakobson in his seminal study on child language.17 These games consist of the stringing together and of the gradual modification of particular sound configura- tions, as in: pupsi, pipsi, titsi, tatsi, feitsa, litsa, bitsa, tatsa. However, Guro does not restrict herself to the stringing of partial similarities on the purely phonetic level; she works with meaningful word units on the one hand and utilizes the semantic potentialities of sounds on the other. The consistently used diminutive suffix -ik, enhances the child-like atmosphere of the poem and the particular selection of sounds phoneti- cally reinforces the key image "kot." Out of a total of 46 consonants, there are thirteen k, nine t, but only three each b, v, r, p, ., 1; two 2, and one each d, n, t, s. It is interesting to note that in the phonetic develop- ment of child language, the two most prominent sounds of the poem (k and t) emerge, as Jakobson pointed out, at a relatively early stage. The velar k is originally merged with the dental t. The latter (t) always precedes the former (k) in the order in which children acquire differen- tiated consonants. 18 Guro's poem is based on or brings into relief the earliest consonantal phonemes of child language. As far as the organi- zation of stressed vowels is concerned, the poem reveals an interesting pattern. Apart from the two initial y sounds, the entire scheme consists of the vowels o and a. The poem opens with two o sounds and ends with two a sounds, enclosing a triplicate alternation of o - a. It is noteworthy that in its reprinted version in the collection The Three (Troe),19 the entire poem is enclosed by two prose sketches in which the vowels o and a represent the distinguishing sounds of the title names, "Kot Bot" and Kot Vat." In the prose works, as in the poem, the image of a cat serves as an impulse for the exploration of the infantile imagination. In "Kot Bot" Guro treats the child's ability to engender new meanings as a by-product of his play with language, for example "U nego byl belyj, ?ivotnen'kij</page><page sequence="9">38 Slavic and East European Journal ?ivotik." (He had a white, tummyzoid tummy). "Kot Vat," a eulogy to Guro's cat, called here "a symbol of eternal youth," "a rising sun," borders on the ridiculous unless seen as an attempt to capture the child's enthusiasm for and ability to bestow freshness on the most ordinary objects in his environment. The three pieces together create not only a thematic sequence but also a continuity in their phonetic patterning. The initial o in the name "Bot" is elaborated in the o-a alternation in the central poem, only to give way to the a sound in the title name "Vat" of the concluding prose sketch. Linked by sound and by their feline subject, the three pieces point to a common semantic denominator. To the extent that, using Kiril Taranovsky's classification of sounds, the vowels o and a are connected by the distinctive feature of compactness "usually associated with emotions of vastness, completeness, greatness, balance, strength, and power,"20 all of these emotions evoked on the level of sound, echo and expand the semantic content of the series. The phonetic level reinforces the common semantic denominator, that is, the allure, greatness, equanimity, and naive sense of omnipotence of the feline protagonist of the three pieces. On the lexical and rhythmic levels, the poem "Words of Love and Warmth" draws on some of the central devices of children's folklore. The importance of diminutives and of rhymes in children's language in general and in children's poetry in particular does not require a great deal of expounding. However, if as has been observed, children's folklore has a special predilection for consecutive rhymes and for the pairing of assonant and rhymed words,21 Guro in her poem takes these devices to their ultimate extreme. The entire poem is buit of consecutively rhymed words which, as suggested above, constitute an extended piling up of partially like configurations. Similar stringing of echoing words occurs also in a poem which, conscious of its playful and carefree origins, opens with the observation: OT cHaCTb5 JieTHero pom)KAaTC CenosBa!

All fine words: Pondlet, watery,/ fordlet,/ dromedary,/ bewildered,/ little freighter. Unlike this poem which accentuates the difficult r sound, the poem "Words of Love and Warmth" contains no difficult consonantal clusters, thus fulfilling the infantile need for easy pronunciation. This is in direct</page><page sequence="10">The Artistic Vision of Elena Guro 39 opposition to the Futurist demand for a "rough texture." Although some members of the extended nominal compounds function as fixed epithets of the word "kotik" ("belovatik," "puSatik," "vorkotik"), others consti- tute neologistic derivations from recognizable roots; they are grammati- cal rather than lexical innovations ("duratik," "pugoneik," "koguratik," "potasik,"). Aware of children's dislike of metaphor,23 Guro forms her neologisms from words that denote concrete actions or attributes and which are in effect synecdoches pertaining to the single subject of the poem. The subject, a cat, represents perhaps the most popular animal figure in children's folklore, particularly in Russian lullabies.24 Al- though Guro's poem is not a lullaby, it is set in an atmosphere of drowsiness, evoked in the brief introductory passage: Y KOTa OT nleHM Tenna pa3ownMcb yWUKM. PasbexanHcb 6apxaTHble yWUKH. A KOT pacKH ... - MC... Ha 6onoTe KaHanHCb 6enOBaTMKI. The cat's ears drifted apart from warmth and laziness. Its velvet ears fell apart. And the cat became li .. .-i ... The whitelings were rocking over the swamp. The word "raski . . .-is .. ." is an onomatopoetic transformation of the word "raskisat"' applied to an optical and dynamic occurence; it is a phonetic and intonational accompaniment to the loss of firmness. Fur- thermore, echoing the word "kiska," the infantile synonym for "ko.ka," it underscores the image of the cat, or rather, its singular condition. It might be said that this word epitomizes what Osip Brik meant by the term "zvukoobraz" (sound-image), the reproduction of a visual sensation by the inner structure of the word. For Alexej Krutenyx, word experi- mentation of this kind served as proof that Elena Guro was an early practitioner of zaum, - transrational poetry. He substantiated his contention by pointing, however, not to "Words of Love and Warmth" but to a much more distinctive illustration, the poem "Finlandia," published in the collection The Three. The analogous innovation in this poem which strives to recreate the aural atmosphere of Finland, is the word ".ujat" instead of ".umjat" (rustle). Krutenyx wrote that conifer- ous trees precisely ".ujat" whereas deciduous trees "?umjat."25 Closely linked with Guro's endeavor to recapture the originality of children's language was her aspiration to reproduce the freshness of their perceptions. Her fascination with the child's ability to perceive freshness in even the most commonplace phenomena is in the back- ground of an entire section of Guro's Hurdy-Gurdy, called "Trifles" (Meloti). In these miniatures, objects are animated with feelings of joy, contentment, and stability. These feelings stem from the presumption</page><page sequence="11">40 Slavic and East European Journal that reality is endowed with intentionality and specifically, with benev- olent intentions not only toward the child but toward all of life. A mere suggestion of strife or difficulty is resolved instantaneously and magic- ally, either in a dream or by the power of a wish. The vision projected here is that of a fairy-tale; but instead of fantastic or supernatural beings, this fairy-tale's protagonists are the minutiae of everyday life, presented in phantasmic illumination. The simple, commonplace ob- jects, designated by words which reflect affectionate attitude, that is, by diminutive forms, are infused with anthropomorphic life as they appear, however, not to an adult but to a child. A different kind of fairy-tale is evoked in the poem "Children's Hurdy-Gurdy" (Detskaja garmanoCka), from the book that inherited part of this poem's title. The fairy-tale is enacted here on the stage of a puppet theater by such commedia del'arte figures as Harlequin and Colombine. Harlequin's song about a wondrous never-never land rep- resents a fairy-tale within the fairy-tale which is the poem. The scene focuses on visual and auditory details, seen independently of any unify- ing and motivating relationship with the whole. The function of the scene is purely esthetic, but esthetic in terms of a naive onlooker, of a child. It is a spectacle which captivates the child's attention with its great variety of things taking place simultaneously: sparkles of icicles and of stars made from gold paper, snowflakes, a quadrille played on the hurdy-gurdy and danced by a cat, rope jumping by Colombine along with Harlequin and a monkey, a duel between two clowns, Harlequin's singing, and so forth. Although the spectacle with its music and multi- farious movement appeals to the sensory perception of the spectator, it also reveals his emotional involvement: "Oh, its thin rims rubbed off a bit!" (Ax ee obodoCki obterlis' nemnolko!). It is noteworthy that although rhythmically the poem consists of what James Bailey defines as "strict accentual verse,"26 with two- and three-ictus lines and with intervals of one to three syllables between stresses, most of the lines have a distinct trochaic cadence. To the extent that such a cadence is often found in children's poetry, the rhythmic structure of the poem enhances the infantile associations of its content. As far as rhyme is concerned, while some lines are rhymed in an alternating pattern of "exact" rhyme, other lines contain merely an "approximate" rhyme, for instance: iskorki-igraet, obodolki-elolkoj. In addition, almost all of the words in the poem are tied together in an intricate pattern of sound repetition, be it alliteration or assonance: s ledjanyx-sosulek-veselen'kuju, obodoCki-obterlis'-soberemsja. The evocation of the world of the fairy-tale is at the center of a number of other works by Guro. One poem in the collection The Three</page><page sequence="12">The Artistic Vision of Elena Guro 41 takes its point of departure from PuSkin's poem-fairy-tale "A Tale About the Dead Tsarevna and About Seven Bogatyrs" (Skazka o mertvoj carevne i o semi bogatyrjax). Guro's poem is an idiosyncratic response to the question known in English as "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all," rendered in the epigraph of her poem: TbI MHe 3epKanb4e CKa)K Aa BCK) npaBAy AOonom) KTO MeHqI 3Aecb Mwnee (79) Tell me, mirror/!

CKaKI4 Aa BCiO npaBAy onom)Km: 9F nb Ha CBeTe BCeX Mnoee, My light, mirror! say/ Report the whole truth:/ Am I the nicest in all the world,... However, while the epigraph in Guro's poem points to its fairy-tale subtext, the poem repudiates the very premise of the fairy-tale world. Not the realm of the marvelous and of the fantastic, but concrete nature, a beautiful flower, constitutes the ideal reality in Guro's framework. Looking at the flower from several perspectives and capturing its mani- fold associations, the poem creates a fairy-tale of its own, a fairy-tale in which the concrete object in nature is seen under a variety of imagina- tive illuminations. Guro's interest in the fairy-tale was in large part motivated by her desire to attain playful and imaginative stylization. Stylization along with the recapitulation of the child's unconventional vision enabled her to render an uncommonplace presentation of concrete reality. Appre- hended by and reflecting the perceptual, linguistic, and imaginative experiences of the child, this reality was at the same time given its literary shape by an artist-the prototypical artist, created in the image and possessing the vision not of a man or woman but of the child. Portraying the artist as a child and the child as an artist, Guro achieved an effective illustration of her primitivist cult of childhood.</page><page sequence="13">42 Slavic and East European Journal NOTES 1 Vasilij Kamenskij, Put' Mntuziasta.

E.F. Kovtun, (Pamjatniki kul'tury) notes that Guro achieves a harmonious synthesis of color and form, conveying thereby a sense of heightened spirituality. Her color organization is based on the principle of co-introducing several hues which "like voices in a Bach fugue reflect and enrich one another as they develop and undergo interdependent transformations" (324-25). Kovtun traces the plastic design and simplicity of Guro's paintings to the influence of cubism (323). 7 Olga MatjuSina, "Prizvanie," Zvezda, No. 3 (1973), 149.
