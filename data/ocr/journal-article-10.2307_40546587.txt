<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Case For George Lukács BY FREDRIC JAMESON For Western readers the idea of George Lukács has often seemed more interesting than the reality. It is as though, in some world of Platonic forms and methodological archetypes, a place were waiting for the Marxist literary critic which (after Plekhanov) only Lukács has seriously tried to fill. Yet in the long run even his more sym- pathetic Western critics turn away from him in varying degrees of disillusionment: they came prepared to contemplate the abstract idea, but in practice they find themselves asked to sacrifice too much. They pay lip-service to Lukács as a figure, but the texts themselves were not what they had had in mind at all.1 Such discomfort is hardly surprising, for it marks the approach of Western relativism to its own conceptual limits: we conceive of our culture, indeed, as a vast imaginary museum in which all life forms and all intellectual positions are equally welcome side by side, pro- viding they are accessible to contemplation alone. Thus, alongside the Christian mystics and the 19th century anarchists, the surrealists and the Renaissance humanists, there would be room for a Marxism that was but one philosophical system among others. Nor can it be some requirement of absolute belief that prevents Marxism from being assimilated in this fashion, for the religions themselves, transformed into images, easily coexist in the eclectic tradition with which we are 1 Susan Sontag: "I, too, am inclined to give Lukacs all the benefit of the doubt, if only in protest against the sterilities of the Cold War which have made it impossible to discuss Marxism seriously for the last decade or more. But we may be generous toward the 'late' Lukács only at the price of not taking him altogether seriously, of subtly patronizing him by treating his moral fervor aesthetically, as style rather than as idea . . ." (Against Interpretation). Adorno: "Lukács' person is above suspicion. But the conceptual framework to which he sacrifices the in- tellect is so narrow as to smother everything that needs to draw free breath to live: the sacrifizio del' intelletto does not leave the latter unscathed . . ." (Noten zur Literatur II). Steiner: "German is Lukács' principal language, but his use of it has grown brittle and forbidding. His style is that of exile; it has lost the habits of living speech," etc. (Language and Silence).</page><page sequence="2">4 FREDRIC JAMESON familiar. No, the peculiarity of the structure of historical materialism lies in its denial of the autonomy of thought itself, in its insistence, itself a thought, on the way in which pure thought functions as a disguised mode of social behavior, in its uncomfortable reminder of the material and historical reality of spirit. Thus as a cultural object, Marxism returns against cultural activity in general to devalue it and to lay bare the class privileges and the leisure which it presupposes for its enjoyment. It thus ruins itself as a spiritual commodity and short-circuits the process of culture consumption in which, in the Western context, it had become engaged. It is therefore the very structure of historical materialism - the doctrine of the unity of thinking and action, or of the social determination of thought - which is irreducible to pure reason or to contemplation; and this, which the Western middle-class philosophical tradition can only understand as a flaw in the system, refuses us in the very act in which we imagine ourselves to be refusing it. No wonder, then, that Lukacs' life work fails to be understood from the inside, as a set of solutions and problems developing out of each other according to their own inner logic and momentum; no wonder his works are taken to be external signs of arbitrary positions, symptoms meaningless in themselves and comprehensible only in terms of shifts in the party line. His intellectual development is replaced by a myth of the career of Lukács which all his Western commen- tators repeat in one form or another without reflexion. After a neo- Kantian period, we are told, after his studies with Simmel and Max Weber, the Hegelian Lukács of the Theory of the Novel (1914-15) begins to emerge. And just as the Kantian had become a Hegelian, so during the war the Hegelian becomes a Marxist, joins the Hungarian Communist Party, participates in the revolutionary government of Bela Kun. The third Lukács, a Bolshevik with strong activist lean- ings and unrepentent Hegelian tendencies, writes a seminal work, History and Class -Consciousness (1923), which the party condemns. In the wake of his autocritique, the most familiar and mature Lukacs takes form - the Stalinist Lukács of the 1930's and 40's, the theore- tician of literary realism, easily assimilable to the official socialist realism of the same period, and expressed in such works as Balzac and French Realism (1945), Goethe and His Time (1947), Russian Realism in World Literature (1949), and The Historical Novel (1955), as well as numerous studies of 19th and 20th century German liter- ature and thought, published in East Berlin after the war. With the thaw, a more moderate Lukács restates his general position on modern-</page><page sequence="3">The Case for George Lukacs 5 ism in On Critical Realism (1958), and after the Hungarian uprising, goes into retirement, preparing the two-volume Aesthetik (1963) in which he returns, but from a Marxist point of view, to the neo- Kantian theoretical projects of his youth. It will be noted that the elaboration of this biographical myth depends on the division of a life into discontinuous "periods," an operation which presents a two-fold advantage. On the one hand, the passage from one period to another falls outside the myth proper: thus the transitions from one position to another turn out either to exceed (as in the notion of a semi-religious conversion to communism) or to fall short (as in the spectacle of servile obedience to the party line) of what even the most sympathetic historical consciousness may be expected to relive and to understand from the inside. On the other, the various periods may now be played off against each other without our having to commit ourselves to any of them. So the young Marx was used against the older one; and early Lukács (whether that of the Theory of the Novel or of History and Class-Consciousness) serves to discredit the later theoretician of realism; indeed, the final Lukács, with his return to the beginning, is bound to suggest the failure and the vanity of the whole enterprise. Yet what if the earlier works proved to be fully comprehensible only in the light of the later ones? What if, far from being a series of self-betrayals, Lukacs' successive positions proved to be a progressive exploration and enlargement of a single complex of problems? In the following pages, we will show that Lukács' work may be seen as a continuous and life-long meditation on narrative, on its basic struc- tures, its relationship to the reality it expresses, and its epistemological value when compared with other, more abstract and philosophical modes of understanding those realities. I. The chief conceptual opposition within which all of Lukács' exam- ination of literature has taken place is the familiar Hegelian one of the concrete and the abstract. Hegel's originality, of course, was to have transformed this purely logical distinction into an ontological one, to have demonstrated how lived experiences and life forms themselves could be in its light evaluated against each other; to have evolved a comparative, or indeed dialectical, mode of thinking such that every perception of a given experience or work is at the same time an awareness of what that experience or work is not: a definition by</page><page sequence="4">6 FREDRIC JAMESON negation. It is clear that the feeling of concreteness, of filled density of being, or that of abstractness and impoverishment of experience, are essentially derived from just such implicit comparisons between one experience and another, one work and another, one moment of history and another. What is perhaps less evident is the degree to which this Hegelian opposition overlaps the more familiar contemporary notion of alien- ation: for the abstract and the alienated, no doubt, name the same object. Only it is easy to see why Western thinkers have on the whole preferred the concept of alienation: the latter permits the diagnosis of an evidently fallen and degraded reality without de- manding of the mind any reciprocal attempt to imagine a state in which man no longer is alienated. It is thus a negative and critical concept, from which the Utopian moment has been quietly elimin- ated; whereas the term abstract forces us, through its very structure as an antithesis, to preserve and develop the idea of concreteness in order to complete our thought. The most characteristic Marxist use of this opposition is of course that according to which it is society itself which is seen as the ultimate source of the concreteness or the abstractness of individual existence. In literary terms, this means that society is conceived at any given historical moment as that préexistent and indeed preformed raw ma- terial which ultimately determines the abstractness or the concreteness of the works of art created within it. "Men make their history themselves," said Engels in a famous passage, "only they do so in a given environment which conditions it, and on the basis of actual relations already existing, among which the economic relations, however much they may be influenced by the other, the political and ideological relations, are still ultimately the decisive ones, forming the keynote which runs through them and alone leads to understanding." It would be a truism to say that the airplane and the department store, the bearer of the Légion d'honneur and the problems of women's emancipation, cannot be elements of works from societies in which these things do not exist: what is more important is the influence of a given social raw material, not only on the content, but on the very form of the works themselves. In the art works of a pre-industrialized, agricultural or tribal society, the artist's raw material is on a human scale, it has an im- mediate meaning, requires no preliminary explanation or justification on the part of the writer. The story needs no background in time because the culture knows no history: each generation repeats the</page><page sequence="5">The Case for George Lukacs 7 same experiences, reinvents the same basic human situations as though for the first time. The social institutions are not felt as external traditions, as forbidding and incomprehensible edifices: au- thority is vested in the king or priest, is immanent to them: as human actors they express it fully in a three-dimensional way. The physical objects of such a world are equally immediate: they are clearly human products, the results of preordained ritual and of an immediately visible hierarchy of village occupations. Even the supernatural, magical or religious, ideology of such a way of life returns to man in the anthropomorphic shape of gods and personalized forces: no doubt it is a projection, but the very mechanism of projection is still naively undisguised in the story-telling structure of the myths themselves. The works of art characteristic of such societies may be called concrete in that their elements are all meaningful from the outset: the writer uses them, but he does not need to demonstrate their meaning before- hand: in Hegel's language this raw material needs no mediation. When we turn from such a work to the literature of the industrial era, everything changes: the elements of the work begin to flee their human center: a kind of dissolution of the human sets in, a kind of centrifugal dispersal in which paths lead out at every point into the contingent, into brute fact and matter, into the not-human. Even those most basic components of the story, the characters themselves, become problematical: now they have personalities, and the choice of personality traits, the portrayal of the hero as dreamy and idealistic rather than choleric and cynical, demands organic justification within the work itself. Thus the hero's temperament will be explained in terms of his father and his family situation; or will perhaps be given as emblematic of a certain relationship to the existing society and its predominant values; will be shown as bearing metaphysical value as a defial of the universe, or in the end simply remains unjustified, whereupon the work tends to sink to the level of accident, to become a kind of case history. The same loss of immediate comprehensibility takes place on other levels as well: in the time of the work, in the institutions that form its background, in the objects among which the characters move. For the unquestioned, ritualistic time of village life no longer exists; there is henceforth a separation between public and private, between work and leisure: and the story must find its elbow-room in a world in which men's lives are divided between routine drudgery and sleep. So the novelist arranges his plot to take place on week-ends (L'Etranger of Camus), during vacations (Thomas Mann), during</page><page sequence="6">8 FREDRIC JAMESON great crises in which the routine breaks down (war literature). If the hero's profession leaves him enough free time for his private life (Joyce's Ulysses), then somehow the very choice of the profession must be justified in its turn (advertising as a poetic activity, as a work with language). Where there is inherited wealth and leisure, either it is based on a kind of unexamined social presupposition (as in the landed gentry who furnish the actors for the 19th century English and Russian novels); or else it remains a mere family accident, and the problem is not solved, but only thrust into the past, into earlier generations (and here the very emblem of the process might well be that unmentioned chamber pot which Henry James privately admitted to have been at the origin of the Newsome fortune in The Ambas- sadors). So also with the very framework of the story itself: the institutions of the modern world, within which the characters live out their dramas, end up as something merely given, as the result of the accidental origin of the work in a particular national situation, at a particular moment of historical development. The village, the city state, is a whole world in itself: but the superhighway, the modern university, or the Amer- ican army, or the great industrial city, all these things constitute unrealized, and ultimately unrealizable, foreign bodies within the work of art. And what is true of overall social organization is all the more visible in the individual commodities of a given society, in the various objects and products among which the characters move: the chairs and motorcycles, the food, houses and revolvers which are no longer felt as the results of immediate human activity, which inhabit the work like so much dead furniture, tear through the human surface of the work like so much alien inorganic matter. It will be observed that modern literature has developed special techniques, elaborate methods of symbolism, in the express hope of giving meaning to such stubbornly resistant things, of assimilating them to the humanized substance of the work of art. And symbolism as such is a central phenomenon of modern literature: we will discuss it later at more length. For the moment it is enough to say that whatever the merits of symbolic and symbolizing modes of thought as a solution to this dilemma, their presence in the work always stands as an indication that the immediate meaning of objects has disappeared: the process would not arise in the first place if objects had not already become problematical in their very nature. A far more telling objection might be made to the reality of this contingency in modern life: it is contingency, it might be said, in</page><page sequence="7">The Case for George Lukacs 9 appearance only. In fact, all such apparently inhuman institutions and things are intensely human in their origin. Never has the world been so completely humanized as in industrial times; never has so much of the individual's environment been the result, not of blind natural forces, but of human history itself. Thus, if the modern work of art were only able to enlarge its point of view far enough, if it were able to make enough connections between such widely disparate phenomena and facts, the illusion of inhumanity would disappear: once again the content of the work would be completely comprehen- sible in human terms, even though on far vaster scale than before. Yet it is precisely this enlargement which is irreconcilable with the very form and structure of literature itself. The framework of the work of art is individual lived experience, and it is in terms of these limits that the outside world remains stubbornly alienated. When we pass from individual experience to that collective dimension, that sociological or historical focus in which human institutions slowly become transparent for us once again, we have entered the realm of disembodied abstract thought, and have left the work of art behind us. And this double standard, this life on two irreconcilable levels, corresponds to a basic fault in the very structure of the modern world: what we can understand as abstract minds we are incapable of living directly and with immediacy in our individual lives and experiences: our world, our works of art, are henceforth abstract. We may therefore conclude this preliminary discussion by empha- sizing the two basic characteristics of concreteness in art. First of all, its situations are such as to permit us to feel everything in them in purely human terms, in terms of individual human experience and individual human acts. Second, such work permits life and experience to be felt as a totality: all its events, all its partial facts and elements, are immediately grasped as part of a total process, which may be social or may still be understood in metaphysical terms. For the moment, the most important aspect for us of this feeling of totality is not the ideology which explains it but rather its immediate presence or absence in that particular social life from which the writer draws his raw material. As we have shown already, if this feeling of im- mediate wholeness and interrelationship is not there in real life to begin with, the artist has no means at his disposal to restore it, at best he can simulate it only. The Theory of the Novel is Lukács' first full-scale attempt to apply these categories to the forms of Western literature. His terminology underlines an opposition in them of essence (Wesen) to life, or in</page><page sequence="8">10 FREDRIC JAMESON other words, of meaningfulness on the one hand, and the events and raw materials of daily existence on the other. The development of forms in ancient Greece provide him with a kind of scale model or dialectical myth of the various possibilities, the various relationships, inherent in this basic opposition. (And we should add that for the moment the historical accuracy of this picture of ancient Greece is of no consequence for us: we may take it merely as a convenient conceptual framework for the presentation of Lukács' discussion of the modern novel.) The first of the three basic stages which Lukács finds in Greek literature is that of the epic, which is concrete in the sense developed above: in it meaning or essence is still immanent to life, and genuine narration, epic narration, is possible only when daily life is still felt to be meaningful and immediately comprehensible down to its small- est details. After this Utopia, in which essence and life are one, the two terms begin to fall apart, and the place of epic is taken by tragedy. For in tragedy meaning and daily existence have become opposed to each other: they coincide only at the moment of the tragic crisis itself, when the hero holds them together for an instant in his own agony, maintaining his absolute demands on life, his ultimate passion for meaning, even on the point of destruction by that meaningless outside world which denies him. Tragedy therefore no longer offers a con- tinuity, but is organized around and is dependent on those heightened instants of crisis alone, fitful and unstable in their very structure. When they also disappear, when meaning and life part company irreparably, then the third stage of Greek art is at hand, that of Platonic philosophy. Here, in a world in which the raw materials of daily life have become utterly worthless, essence or meaning takes refuge in the purely intellectual realm of the Ideas, and literature, except insofar as it expresses itself in the Platonic myths and fables, has become itself impossible. Already, in spite of their common methodology, the differences between the Lukács of Theory of the Novel and Hegel himself, parti- cularly in the Aesthetik, become apparent. Despite the great value Hegel places on Greek art, he sees the history of Western art, and history in general, as an ascension of forms, from the symbolic forms of oriental art, in which the spirit is still caught and emprisoned in matter and in the monstrous forms of the Assyrian and Egyptian deities, through the classical forms of Greece, in which spirit finds its adequate expression in the purely human figure, to the romantic art of the modern world, in which matter little by little falls away, and</page><page sequence="9">The Case for George Lukacs 1 1 pure spirit comes to expression in language. No doubt Hegel had already felt the novel to be a modern replacement of epic, in Lukacs' sense. But for him, as is well known, the fulfillment of art lies, not in any art form, but in its self- transcendence, in the transformation of art into philosophy: what human beings at first naively projected in religion, what they then made visible to themselves in artistic creation, they ultimately bring to self-consciousness only in philosophy itself. But for Lukacs, as we will see again and again in varying contexts, pure thought never has absolute value as a privileged means of access to reality: on the contrary, it is narration which is for him the absolute, and even the preliminary sketch of the stages of Greek art has for its presupposition the primacy of narration. Only the epic can be considered a purely narrative form: tragedy is drama, that is to say, it presents instants only, can no longer have recourse to the techniques of narrative continuity; and in philosophy, of course, the dominance of pure thought, far from being a virtue, is judged and evaluated precisely by its elimination of narration as a formal possi- bility. It is against this preliminary background that the basic idea of the Theory of the Novel emerges: the novel as a form is the attempt in modern times to recapture something of the quality of epic narration, as a reconciliation between matter and spirit, between life and essence. It is a substitute for epic, under life conditions which henceforth make the epic impossible: "it is the epic of a world abandoned by God." As such, the novel is no longer a closed and established form, with built-in conventions, like tragedy or epic: rather it is problematical in its very structure, a hybrid form which must be reinvented at every moment of its development; and each novel is a process in which the very possibility of narration must begin in a void, without any acquired momentum. Its privileged subject matter will therefore be the search, in a world in which neither goals nor paths are established beforehand. It is a process in which we witness the very invention of those problems whose solution is its story. Where the epic hero represented a collec- tivity, formed part of a meaningful, organic world, the hero of the novel is always a solitary subjectivity: he is problematical, that is to say, he must always stand in opposition to his setting, to nature or society, inasmuch as it is precisely his relationship to them, his integration into them, which is the issue at hand. Any reconciliation between the hero and his environment which was given from the beginning of the book and not painfully won in the course of it would</page><page sequence="10">12 FREDRIC JAMESON stand as a kind of illicit presupposition, a kind of cheating with the form, in which the whole novel as process would be invalidated. The prototype of the novel's hero is therefore the madman or the criminal; the work is his biography, the story of his setting forth to "prove his soul" in the emptiness of the world. But of course he can never really do so, for if genuine reconciliation were possible, then the novel as such would cease to exist, would once more give place to epic wholeness. Thus the novel, as an attempt to give meaning to the outside world and to human experience, is always the result of subjective will, subjective wilfullness: it is not the world from which such unity springs, as in the epic, but rather the mind of the novelist which attempts to impose it, by fiat. For this reason, the activity of the novelist always takes place under the sign of what the German Roman- tics called Irony: for Romantic Irony is characterized by a structure in which the work takes its own subjective origin into account, in which the creator completes his creation by pointing to himself: larvatus prodeo. Thus it can be said that for Lukács the most basic image of human freedom is not the hero of the novel, for he can never succeed in his quest for ultimate meaning, but rather the novelist him- self, who in telling the story of failure succeeds: whose very creation stands as that momentary reconciliation of matter and spirit towards which his hero strives in vain. The creative activity of the novelist is the "negative mysticism of a godless world". The novel has therefore ethical significance. The ultimate ethical goal of human life is Utopia, that is, a world in which meaning and life are once more indivisible, in which man and the world are at one. But such language is abstract, and Utopia is not an idea but a vision. It is therefore not abstract thought, but concrete narration itself which is the proving ground of all Utopian activity, and the great novelists offer a concrete demonstration of the problems of Utopia in the very formal organization of their styles and intrigues themselves, whereas the Utopian philosophers only offer a pallid and abstract dream, an insubstantial wish-fulfillment. Given the opposition between matter and spirit on which Lukacs' theory rests, it is clear that novels will tend to fall into two general groups, depending on which term is accented. Yet in another sense the simplicity of this typology is deceptive; for the starting point of the novel must always be subjective, must always be human experience: the objective term, the outside world, scarcely bothers to dream of its reconciliation with man. So the world-oriented novel (which Lukács</page><page sequence="11">The Case for George Lukács 13 calls the novel of abstract idealism) proves to be based on a kind of optical illusion. Its hero is characterized by a blind and unshakeable conviction in the world's meaning, by an unjustified and obsessive faith in the success of his quest in the here-and-now, in the very pos- sibility of reconciliation. For such an obsessed hero (whose prototype is of course Don Quixote), the apparent resistance of the real world can be easily accounted for by magic and the hostile operations of evil sorcerers: thus he never really comes into contact with outside reality, but only with the Utopian vision of it which was his starting point. The paradoxical result of such an attitude in the form is that the novel of abstract idealism will result in a series of objective events and adven- tures, will offer an objective surface, even though this surface objec- tivity is nothing but the result of madness and subjective obsession. The precondition for the creation of Don Quixote was a social world in which secular rationality was still imperfectly disengaged from the superstitious and ritualistic world-view of the middle ages, in which therefore Don Quixote's madness was not capricious, but corresponded to a reality in the outside world itself: and this reality is of course interiorized in the novel in the form of the romances and dreams of chivalry, so that the novel as a whole becomes, not the un- questioned and degraded story-telling of these popular stories, but a reflection on the very possibility of story-telling itself, a coming to self-consciousness of narration. Yet as the modern world grows increas- ingly secularized, the tension which gave Don Quixote its vitality begins to dissolve: the heroes of abstract idealism no longer find their justification in their moment of history, but tend increasingly to be- come arbitrary, mere grotesques, whose idée fixe is capricious: and in a novelist like Dickens we find a static, lifeless opposition between amusing eccentrics on the one hand, and a sentimentalized middle-class universe on the other (sentimentalized precisely because the novelist has taken it at face value, has smuggled into his work a preconception as to the nature of that external reality which it was the business of the novel to explore without any preconceptions). Only in Balzac perhaps is some ultimate version of the novel of abstract idealism possible: and even here, in the henceforth secularized world, it is based on a formal tour de force. On the one hand, we find the familiar obsessed hero, the man of the idée fixe, inventor, poet, businessman, aristocrat: yet the second term of the opposition, that outside reality without which no tension is possible, is now nothing more than the sum total of all the other obsessed characters of la Comédie humaine itself, in other words, of society. Thus once more</page><page sequence="12">14 FREDRIC JAMESON a genuine totality comes into being in which the other works of the series provide a density of external reality, a massive resisting outside world, for use in the individual conflict within any given story. Yet obviously this tension is bought at great cost: the Comédie humaine is what Sartre would call a de-totalized totality, it is never completely present in any individual work, only the fragments of the whole are fully realized before us. With Balzac the novel of abstract idealism is exhausted as a form, the reality of the modern world no longer offers adequate materials for its construction. So slowly the second general type of narration, the novel of romantic disillusionment, comes into being to replace the first. Here the empha- sis is squarely on the soul itself, on the subjective experiences of the hero whose task is to interpret the world from within his own conscious- ness. Where the first form threatened to disintegrate into a series of empty adventures, into hollow picaresque or entertainment literature, this second type of novel is immediately menaced by solipsism. Its hero is passive-receptive, contemplative, and his story is forever on the point of dissolution into the purely lyrical and fragmentary, into a series of subjective moments and moods in which genuine narration is lost. Yet at this point Lukács makes one of his most remarkable observa- tions and it has often been pointed out that in this he anticipates the whole direction of the modern novel (Proust, Mann, Joyce) at a time, 1914, when it was only just coming into being. For where the external world of the earlier novel form was primarily spatial, where the hero's experience of such a world took the form of a series of adventures and wandering through geographical space, now, in the novel of romantic disillusionment, the dominant mode of being of external reality will be Time itself. It is this shift in meta-physical emphasis which will save the most illustrious examples of the new form, such as Flaubert's Education sentimentale, from mere static poetry, which will once more justify and permit a kind of genuine narration in them. Now once again the passive-contemplative hero can act, his life can be told as a story: yet these acts are now acts in Time, are Hope and Memory. Now once again the novel can express a kind of unity of meaning and life, but it is a unity thrust into the past, a unity remembered only. For in the present the world always defeats the hero, frustrates his longing for reconciliation: yet when he remembers his failure, par- adoxically he is at one with it: the process of memory has drawn the resistant outside world into subjectivity and has there, in the past, reinstated a kind of unity with it. In this the remembering hero is a</page><page sequence="13">The Case for George Lukacs 15 little like the novelist himself: for both, Time is profoundly ambiguous in its very nature, both a life-giving and a life-destroying force. In the hero's life it is the source of all pain, of all loss, the very element of his education to the vanity of all things: yet at the very same moment, Time is for novelist and reader the basic fabric of life itself, and of the illusion of a richness of experience. Time is duration and flow at once, results in a density of narration in the same moment in which narration underlines the tragic passage and ephemerality of all things. After these two basic types of narration, Lukacs presents us with attempts at synthesis, in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister and in the novels of Tolstoy. And, as we might expect, these syntheses are themselves polarized, into a subjective and an objective orientation. In Wilhelm Meister a hero of a relatively passive-receptive, romantic type ends by discovering a meaningful external universe, a social environment which no longer resists the individual, but offers fulfillment to his subjective talents and potentialities, which is not characterized by dehumanized, alienated institutions, but rather reflects purpose in its hierarchy of tasks, is once more on a human scale. Yet this recon- ciliation is based on a tour de force: for the form of the book as a whole is dependent on the existence of the masonic-like elite who appear at its conclusion. All the apparently accidental adventures and encounters of Wilhelm Meister turn out to be deliberate tests and object lessons planned for him by this all-knowing priestly caste into which he is ultimately received. Thus the apparent solidity of Goethe's novel is the result of a forcing, a deformation, of external reality along the lines of wish-fulfillment: Utopia is not won concretely line by line, but established by fiat at the end of the book which reaches back and transforms its beginning. Tolstoy on the other hand profits from the existence in his historical situation of an element absent from the experience of the Western European novelist: from the presence of Nature itself, which grounds the portrayal of the external world, the second term of the novelist's opposition, in renewed solidity. Where in the West, the drama of the individual and his passions was opposed to the empty convention- ality of his society, in Tolstoy both of these phenomena are seen as ultimately deformed and vitiated, both enter into opposition with Nature itself, with glimpses of some primal reunified genuine natural existence. Yet once again this tension is a precarious one: for it depends, not on any realized and fully achieved narration of the natural term, the natural life, but on mere lyric glimpses of what such</page><page sequence="14">16 FREDRIC JAMESON a life might be. In this sense Tolstoy falls short of a reinvention of the epic, creates fragments that strive towards epic unity only. For it is clear to Lukács, at the end of his work, that the transfor- mation of novel into epic has as its precondition, not the novelist's will, but the transformation of his society and his world. The renewed epic cannot come into being until the world itself has been transfigured, regenerated; and his final comment, that the novels of Dostoyevski offer a glimpse into such an ultimate, totally humanized Utopia, must be taken more in the way of prediction than of formal analysis. The great richness and suggestiveness of the Theory of the Novel results more from the problems its speculative framework permits it to raise than from the solutions it offers. In the first place, there is in it a contradiction between form and content which ultimately casts doubt on its conclusions. For on the formal level, as an analysis of the work of the novelist himself, of his perpetual effort to reconcile spirit and matter, the Theory of the Novel is irreproachable; yet insofar as the book also involves a theory of the hero, a theory of the novel's content, we may be surprised to detect a whole set of hidden presuppositions, a whole preconceived psychology which is in conflict with the neutral or purely formal Hegelian conceptual framework of the rest of the book. Here indeed we find Lukács describing the hero's quest as an attempt to "prove his soul" (Browning), to overcome the primal homesickness of Being by "returning home" in a metaphysical sense (Novalis: "Immer nach Hause!"), by reintegrating that "trans- cendental site" (neo-Kantianism) which was the original dwelling of the soul. The objection is not to this doctrine as such, which has its own fascination for the modern mind and suggests ideas of Heideg- ger and Kierkegaard, but to its incompatibility with Lukács' formal description of the novel as a process in which no guide-lines are given in advance, in which therefore even this characterization of man's metaphysical quest in the world is not permissible, and stands as a preconceived value imposed on the initial formlessness of existence. We may state this contradiction in another way by recalling the degree to which all of Lukacs' analyses of the novel depend on what is a kind of literary nostalgia, on the notion of a golden age or lost Utopia of narration in Greek epic. No doubt, as we indicated above, such a conception of literary history may simply be taken as an or- ganizational fiction, as a mythological framework, for the concrete analyses of the book: yet in the long run, the historical inadmissibility of the framework returns to vitiate the individual analyses. By the same token, any change in the framework will entail a far-reaching</page><page sequence="15">The Case for George Lukacs 17 réévaluation of the empirical history of the novel itself. Obviously now the ultimate realization of a reconciled universe will be projected into the future, and with such a shift in perspective we are already well within a Marxist theory of history. But more than this, we would expect the removal of the idea of a golden age to result in a new interpretation of modern literature as well, and to allow for the possibility of at least partial moments of reconciliation in modern times, of at least isolated examples of genuinely concrete works of art in a way which the overall historical scheme of the Theory of the Novel seemed to preclude. Yet even in the Hegelian framework of the book itself there are weaknesses which Lukács' later work will attempt to rectify: the aim of the work is the creation of a typology, of a characteristically Hegelian working out of pure formal possibilities in the chronological unfolding of history itself. The evident weakness of such a typological viewpoint can be seen in such passages as the one in which Lukács, having established the novel of romantic disillusionment as a general category, as a genus, admits that it has perhaps only one genuine representative or member, namely the Education sentimentale of Flaubert. And just as Marx, standing the Hegelian dialectic on its feet, dissolved the Hegelian series of ideal forms into the empirical reality of history itself, so from this logical defect of the Theory of the Novel it is but a step to the abandonment of types as such, to the apprehension of Flaubert's work itself as a unique concrete empirical historical phenomenon, as a unique moment of the history of the novel, an ungeneralizable combination of circumstances. At this point, then, we would expect further development along the lines of the Theory of the Novel to result in the replacement of the all -encompass- ing typological theory by a series of concrete historical monographs, by a dissolution into concrete literary history itself. Finally, it should be noted that even within the framework of the Theory itself there are signs of an important shift in perspective. In the first two typological chapters (those which defined the novels of abstract idealism and of romantic disillusionment), the content of the novel was characterized as an opposition between man and the outside world. Even when the resistance to the hero comes in the shape of other characters, Lukács basically thinks of this resistance in terms of a struggle between man and his environment, between man and the universe, between man and things: the human elements of the conflict are always assimilated to the more general category of the World itself, the not-I, the Being of nature. Such a way of looking at the</page><page sequence="16">18 FREDRIC JAMESON drama of human life cannot but be metaphysical, for the basic model is always the relationship of man to some absolute outside himself. Yet when we turn to the chapters on Goethe and Tolstoy, we find that, perhaps without any conscious awareness on Lukács1 part, this metaphysical second term, the World, has imperceptibly glided into a new one, namely Society. But at this point everything changes, and the very quality of the opposition is different: the new tension is not a metaphysical, but a historical one, and man's relationship to his social environment is no longer the static and contemplative one of his metaphysical situation in the universe. For society is an evolving and changing organism, and now for the first time it is given to the hero of the novel as Lukács sees him not only to contemplate his distance from external reality in a fixed manner, but to change it. Now external reality is not alien to him, but of the same substance as himself, for it is history, and the result of the activities of men, and that maxim of Vico will come into play which is so significant in Lukács' later work and indeed for Marxism in general: "the compre- hensibility of human history, as opposed to that of nature, lies in this, that we ourselves made the one, and did not make the other." Thus, in the very working out of the problems of the Theory of the Novel itself there are decisive signs of that shift from a metaphysical to a historical view of the world that will be ratified by Lukács' conversion to Marxism. Indeed, I would be tempted to reverse the causal re- lationship as it is generally conceived, and to claim that if Lukács became a Communist, it was precisely because the problems of nar- ration raised in the Theory of the Novel required a Marxist framework to be thought through to their logical conclusion. II. His next work, History and Class-Consciousness (1923), would however seem to have little enough to do with these purely literary problems. Its title is misleading enough, for the new book is not so much political as it is epistemological, and aims at laying the founda- tion in a technical manner for a new Marxist theory of knowledge. By "class consciousness," therefore, Lukács means not so much an empirical and psychological phenomenon, nor those collective man- ifestations explored by sociology, but rather the a priori limits or ad- vantages conferred by affiliation with the bourgeoisie or the proletariat upon the mind's capacity to apprehend external reality. Thus this immensely influential work of Lukács distinguishes itself from the outset from the more familiar Western critique of ideology as it is</page><page sequence="17">The Case for George Lukacs 19 practiced by such writers as Lucien Goldmann and Sartre. For the concept of ideology already implies mystification, and conveys the notion of a kind of floating and psychological worldview, a kind of subjective picture of things already by definition unrelated to the external world itself. The consequence is that even a proletarian world-view is relativized, and felt to be ideological, while the ultimate standard of truth becomes the positivistic one of some "end of ideology" which would leave us in the presence of the facts themselves, without any subjective distortions. It is however because Lukacs takes so-called bourgeois philosophy seriously that he can evolve an adequate theory of proletarian knowl- edge. For him, we may say, what is false is not so much the content of classical middle-class philosophy as it is the form; and in this, Lukacs applies to the realm of philosophy the method that Marx himself had already practiced in his critique of middle-class economics. For Marx's criticism of his predecessors (Smith, Say, Ricardo) aimed not so much at the detail of their work - theory of ground rent, market circulation, accumulation of capital, etc. - most of which he takes over into his own system; but rather at the over-all model, or lack of it, in which these details find their interpretation, in which they are to be put in perspective as parts or functions of some larger totality. Marx is able to show, not only that the middle-class economists were unable to evolve a unified field theory into which these various empirically observed phenomena might be integrated, but indeed, that in an almost instinctive fashion they avoided doing so. It was as though they sensed the dangerous social and political consequences of the kind of total and systematic model of economic reality which will later be embodied in Das Kapital: in order to avoid those con- sequences they are obliged to pursue their research on a fragmentary and empirical level only. Marxism is frequently misunderstood as a theory of material or economic interest; even though at the level of individual psychology the notion of self-interest originates much earlier, at the time of Hobbes and La Rochefoucauld. Yet it would be less inexact to claim that Marxism is a theory of collective or class self-interest. For while it is not at all surprising or paradoxical to find a man willing to sacrifice his immediate personal interests for some greater ideal or cause, the very passionate adherence to such a cause, its binding force, is almost certain to derive from its collective basis, from its structure as a defense mechanism of the group or class with which the individual feels himself at one. The member of a given class therefore defends</page><page sequence="18">20 FREDRIC JAMESON not so much his own individual existence and privileges, as the very preconditions of those privileges in general: and in the realm of thought also he is willing to venture only to the point at which those preconditions begin to be called into question. We may therefore in a more abstract way say that the influence of class-consciousness on thought is felt not so much in the perception of the individual details of reality as in the over-all form or Gestalt according to which those details are organized and interpreted. As with Marx's critique of middle-class economic theories, so also for the Lukacs of History and Class -Consciousness the limits of middle- class philosophy are signalled by its incapacity or unwillingness to come to terms with the category of totality itself. That this is no mere external standard of judgement but rather a dilemma with which the classical philosophers were themselves concerned may be seen in the orientation of pre-Marxist German philosophy around the problem of the universality of the individual subject or knower: a universality which is posited in abstract form only in the concept of the trans- cendental ego of Kant or in Hegel's absolute spirit. Lukacs' originality is to have returned this abstract philosophical problem to its concrete situation in social reality itself, and to have asked the question of the relationship between universality on the epistemological level and the class-affiliation of the individual thinker himself. For Kant's critical philosophy had already assigned its ultimate limits to the universality to which middle-class rationalism had aspired. (For Kant, of course, these limits are not those of middle-class thought alone, but of the human mind in general: but this a-historical manner of posing the problem only marks his profound identification with the type of thought he is studying.) According to Kant, the mind can understand everything about external reality except for the incompre- hensible and contingent fact of its existence in the first place: it can deal exhaustively with its own perceptions of reality without ever coming to terms with noumena, or things-in-themselves. For Lukács, however, this dilemma of classical philosophy, to which Kant's system is a monument, derives from an even more fundamental, pre-philo- sophical attitude towards the world which is ultimately socio-economic in character: namely from the tendency of the middle classes to understand our relationship to external objects (and consequently our knowledge of those objects) in static and contemplative fashion. It is as though our primary relationship to the things of the outside world were not one of making or use, but rather that of a motionless gaze, in a moment of time suspended, across a gap which it subse-</page><page sequence="19">The Case for George Lukacs 21 quently becomes impossible for thoughts to bridge. The dilemma of the Thing-in-itself becomes then a kind of optical illusion or false problem, a kind of distorted reflection of this initially immobile situa- tion which is the privileged moment of middle-class knowledge. But this static relationship to the objects of knowledge is itself but a reflexion of the life experience of the middle classes in the economic and social realm itself. Their relationship to the objects which they produce, to the commodities, the factories, and the very structure of capitalism itself, is a contemplative one, in that they are not aware of capitalism as a historical phenomenon, as being itself the result of historical forces, as having within itself also the possi- bility of change or of radical transformation. They can understand everything about their social environment (its elements, its function- ing, its implicit laws), except the existence of the environment it- self: their rationalism can assimilate everything but the ultimate questions of purpose and existence. In this sense, capitalism is itself the first Thing-in-itself, and the primal contradiction upon which all later more specialized and abstract dilemmas are founded. When we turn now to the class consciousness of the worker, to those new possibilities of thought inherent in the structure of a proletarian epistemology, it is clearly not enough simply to claim that the philosophical problems are different, that the old problems and dilemmas no longer obtain. What Lukács must show is that proletarian thought has precisely the capacity for resolving antinomies which middle-class thinking in its very nature was unable to deal with: he must show how something in the very structure of proletarian thought itself permits access to the totality of reality, and to that totalizing knowledge which was the stumbling block of classical bourgeois philosophy, to an overcoming of the static model of knowl- edge from which the classical middle-class dilemmas sprang. Some- thing must be found in the very lived situation of the proletarian himself which corresponds, as a concrete reality, to that union of subject and object, of knower and known, which Hegel posited as a solution to the Kantian problem of the Thing-in-itself in the domain of pure thought. This privileged structure of the worker's situation lies paradoxically in its narrow, inhuman limits: the worker is unable to know the outside world in a static, contemplative manner in one sense because he cannot know it at all, because his situation does not give the leisure to intuit it in the middle-class sense, because, even before he posits elements of the outside world as objects of his thought, he feels himself to be an object, and this initial alienation, within</page><page sequence="20">22 FREDRIC JAMESON himself, takes precedence over everything else. Yet precisely in this terrible alienation lies the strength of the worker's position: his first movement is not towards knowledge of the work, but towards knowl- edge of himself as an object, towards self-consciousness. Yet this self- consciousness, because it is initially knowledge of an object (him- elf, his own labor as a commodity, his life forces which he is under the obligation to sell), permits him more genuine knowledge of the commodity nature of the outside world than is granted to middle-class "objectivity". For "his consciousness is the self-consciousness of merchandise itself, or in other words, it is the self-consciousness, or the revelation to consciousness of capitalist society based on commodity production and exchange". Implicit in this new type of self-consciousness are all the elements of a successful solution to those epistemological dilemmas in which middle-class thought found itself involved. It is commodities that structure our original relationship to objects of the world, that shape the categories through which we see all other objects. Yet such objects are ambiguous; they vary in appearance accordingly as their objective nature or their subjective origin is emphasized. Thus for the bourgeois, a commodity is a solid material thing whose cause is relatively unim- portant, relatively secondary: his relationship to such an object is one of pure consumption. The worker on the other hand knows the finished product as little more than a moment in the process of pro- duction itself: his attitude towards the outside world itself will thereby be significantly altered. For he will see the objects around him in terms of change, rather than the timeless "natural" present of the middle class universe (with its corresponding emphasis on Man as a universal). Moreover, inasmuch as he knows the interrelationship of tools and equipment to each other, he will come to see the outside world, not as a collection of separate, unrelated things, but as a totality in which everything depends on everything else. Thus, in both of these ways, he will come to apprehend reality as process, and the reification into which the outside world had frozen for the middle classes will be dissolved. The privileged relationship to reality, the privileged mode of knowledge of the world, will no longer be a static, contemplative one, will no longer be one of pure reason or abstract thought, but will be the union of thought and action which the Marxists call praxis, will be one of activity conscious of itself. At this point the Kantian problem of the Thing-in-itself, of the predicate of being, is doubly resolved: first of all, Being is found to be an abstraction, the consideration of it as a</page><page sequence="21">The Case for George Lukacs 23 separate phenomenon is bound to lead to antinomies, inasmuch as the basic reality of the world is one of becoming and process. And second, as was already foreshadowed in Hegel's system, the outside world, as the result of human labor, considered now not as Nature but as History, is of the same substance as the subjectivity of the worker himself: the subjectivity of men can be seen as products of the same social forces which create commodities and ultimately the entire reality of the world in which men live. Henceforth, following the usage of Lenin in Materialism and Empiriocriticism, Lukács will characterize the process of knowledge itself as one of a reflection (Widerspiegelung) of reality. But the various polemics to which the so-called reflection theory of knowledge has given rise may be avoided by seeing in this figure of speech not so much a theory in its own right as the sign of a theory to be elabo- rated: "the discovery of a reflection . . . always indicates the existence of an articulated link between at least two systems of relationships; the notion of reflection at this point functions as an indication ('signal') of this articulated link. But when it is a question of think- ing this link as such . . . then the concept of process alone proves to be genuinely operative, that is to say productive of the knowledge of such a link."2 The figure of the reflection of reality in thought is therefore simply a kind of conceptual shorthand designed to mark the presence of that type of mental operation we have elsewhere de- scribed as a historical trope, namely the setting in contact with each other of two distinct and incommensurate realities, one in the super- structure and the other in the base, the one cultural and the other socio-economic. We may now draw some conclusions as to the implications of History and Class-Consciousness for the literary problems with which Lukács had previously been concerned. It would seem indeed that it was epistemology, and abstract philosophy in general, which tends under its own internal momentum to reduce the phenomenon of reflection to a static type of mental image more or less adequate to the realities outside. What Lukacs describes as proletarian truth is on the contrary a sense of forces at work within the present, a dissolving of the reified surface of the present into a coexistence of various and conflicting historical tendencies, a translation of immobile objects into acts and potential acts and into the consequences of acts. Indeed, we are tempted to claim that for the Lukács of History and Class- 2 J. L. Houdebine, "Sur une lecture de Lénine," Tel Quel: Théorie d'ensemble (Seuil, 1968), 295-296.</page><page sequence="22">24 FREDRIC JAMESON Consciousness the ultimate resolution of the Kantian dilemma is to be found, not in the nineteenth century philosophical systems them- selves, not even in that of Hegel, but rather in the nineteenth century novel: for the process he describes bears less resemblance to the ideals of scientific knowledge than it does to the elaboration of plot. Thus, with its humiliation of middle-class philosophy, History and Class Consciousness lays the ground work for that differentiation of the esthetic experience which Lukács will later exhaustively work out in the Aesthetik,* where indeed narration is valorized in that it presupposes neither the transcendence of the object pole (as in science) nor that of the subject (as in ethics), but rather a neutralization and mutual reconciliation between the two, thus in its very structure anticipating the life experience of a Utopian world. Yet inasmuch as the construction of Utopia henceforth no longer falls to literature, but rather to praxis and political action itself, the whole organizational framework of the Theory of the Novel must now be reconsidered. Now indeed that nostalgic vision of some golden age in which an epic wholeness was still possible gives place to a view of history for which men already are implicitly reconciled to the world around them, in the sense in which that world is itself neces- sarily the result of human labor and human action. Yet the failure to see through the reified surface of the outside world is itself histor- ically conditioned: for before the nineteenth century, when the bases of modern capitalism are laid in the form of thorough-going indus- trialization of the environment and world-wide organization of the market system, the prerequisites for a genuinely historical understand- ing of life are not yet complete. It is not until the nineteenth century, therefore, that what had previously been understood (and expressed) in terms of a conflict between man and destiny or Nature can be narrated in the purely human and social categories of what Lukacs will henceforth call realism. III. After History and Class Consciousness, therefore, there can be no question of a return to the kind of Hegelian and typological deduction of possible novelistic structures which had been undertaken in the Theory of the Novel. Now on the contrary Lukacs sets himself the task of exploring the conditions of possibility of precisely those works which have been able to "reflect" social reality in its most concrete 8 But already sketched out in "The Subject-Object Relationship in Art," Logos, 1917-18.</page><page sequence="23">The Case for George Lukacs 25 historicity, in short, of accounting theoretically for the existence of what he will call the great realists, of Goethe and Scott, Balzac, Keller, Tolstoy. That he will later shift more questionably from description to prescription and attack modern writers in the name of some a priori model of realism does not invalidate this starting point, for which the word merely designates the empirical existence of a concrete body of works to be explored. No doubt the most obvious and immediate method of character- izing what is distinctive in realism lies through an analysis of the content of the realistic works, and in particular of the human motif in them, of the characters themselves. For Lukács realistic characters are distinguished from those in other types of literature by their typicality: they stand, in other words, for something larger and more meaningful than themselves, than their own isolated individual destinies. They are both concrete individualities, and yet at the same time maintain a relationship with some more general or collective human substance. The notion of typicality, which for Western literary theory has become old-fashioned, if not downright suspect, was already present in what must be the first full-scale specimen of Marxist literary criticism, namely the long exchange of letters between Marx, Engels and Lassalle about the latter's play, Franz von Sickingen. It was therefore explicitly related to the problem of the historical drama, or the histori- cal work of art in general: and Lukacs' own version of this idea is worked out at great length in his book, The Historical Novel. For if its relevance to other forms of literature may be questioned, there can at least be no doubt that the historical work, aiming explic- itly at a picture of a whole period of history, bears thus in itself a standard by which it may then be judged and the question as to whether the characters and situation of a historical work are adequate to reflect the basic historical situation itself has validity in terms of the form itself. The problem is one of the role of the accidental and of the necessary in the work of art: does the free shaping power of the historical playwright or novelist extend to certain kinds of liberties with the subject matter which he has (through his initial free choice) assigned himself? For Lassalle, the tragedy of Sickingen (which he meant to be exemplary of the general tragic situation of the German revolution in 1848) lay in a moral and intellectual flaw: the leader of the first revolt against the great princes during the upheavals of the German Reformation fell because of his ingrained diplomatic and political mentality, because as a statesman he allowed himself to be unduly fascinated with the intricacies of Realpolitik and intrigue</page><page sequence="24">26 FREDRIC JAMESON among the princes, and lost sight of the vital revolutionary energies generated by the revolutionary goal itself. Lassalle's defence of his play seems at first glance unanswerable: This was the tragedy he wanted to write, he tells Marx and Engels, although at the same time there were many others he could have chosen. No doubt had he told the story of Thomas Muenzer, he admits, the whole basis of the tragic situation would have been quite different. But for Marx and Engels the play is faulty because the intellectual flaw which Lassalle stresses is not the real cause of Sickingen's down- fall. The latter was not a moral but a social one: Sickingen could never have had the support of the revolutionary peasants because his basic social aim was utterly different from theirs, aimed, not at a liberation of the land itself, but at the reestablishment of the petit nobility, which itself suffered from the domination of the great princes and of the Church. Thus, for Marx and Engels, the tragic situation of Sickingen was an objective one, and had nothing to do with any agonizing moral choices inside his mind, any grandiloquent moral postures he might strike on stage. As the play stands, the character of Sickingen does not typify the real historical dilemma, the situation of the play does not give a genuine model of the forces at work during the period: and Marx and Engels show how all the formal weaknesses of the play (its endless speechifying, its reminiscences of Schiller rather than Shakespeare) flow from this more fundamental weakness, this inadequacy of the work to its raw material. The interest for us of such an analysis, as well as those of Lukacs in The Historical Novel which follow much the same line of reasoning, lies in the idea that the form of the work is dependent on some deeper logic of the raw material itself; the word typical merely serves as a name for the articu- lation into individual characters of this basic reality which is the sub- stance or content of the work of art. Of course this category has been badly mishandled in the vulgar Marxist practice of reducing characters to mere allegories of social forces, of turning "typical" characters into mere symbols of class: such as the petty bourgeois, the counter-revolutionary, the landed noble- man, the Utopian socialist intellectual and so forth. Sartre has pointed out that such categories are themselves idealistic, in that they presuppose immutable forms, eternal Platonic ideas, of the various social classes: what they leave out is precisely history itself, and the notion of the unique historical situation, to which Lukács has himself always been faithful in his own criticism. We cannot here discuss the more immediate and interesting features</page><page sequence="25">The Case for George Lukacs 27 of Lukács' discussion of types in the historical novel, in particular his distinction between world-historical figures (that is to say, the great names of history, the Richelieus or Cromwells or Napoleons) and the average, relatively anonymous, invented figures whom Scott places at the center of his novels. It is enough to point out that here, as everywhere, Lukács' method is a formal one; and in this case turns on a distinction between the forms of the drama and of the novel, and of the relative functional difference between characters in each. The great historical figures, the real leading characters of history, will be central in drama (Macbeth, Wallenstein, Galileo) because the dramatic collision is a far more concentrated and heightened one; whereas the novel, which aims at a total picture of the historical back- ground, can only tolerate such figures in secondary, episodic appear- ances, for it is only in such a distant, secondary way that they appear in our everyday lives, in our own lived experience. But the essential characteristics of the typical are to be found else- where: in particular, it should be noted that for Lukács the typical is never photographic. In that perennial confrontation of Balzac with Zola, to which we will return, he points out that the romantic exagger- ation and unrealistic grotesqueness of the Balzacian character, as melodramatic as it is, is far more expressive of underlying social forces, is far more profoundly typical, than are the highly schematic, stereo- typed characters of Zola (the rich peasant, the miner, the factory owner, the shopkeeper, and so forth), even though the latter would seem at first glance to be far more adequate to the basic aims of realism itself. It is as if, in the works of Zola, the idea, the precon- ceived theory, intervened between the work of art and the reality to be presented: Zola already knows what the basic structure of society is, and this is his weakness. For him the basic raw material, the professions, the socially determined character types, are already determined in advance: this is to say that he has succumbed to the temptation of abstract thought, of the mirage of some static, objective knowledge of society. Implicitly he has admitted the superiority of positivism and science over mere imagination: but for a point of view like that of Lukács, for which narration is the basic category, and abstract knowledge a second best only, this means that the novel in Zola's hands has ceased to become the privileged instrument of the analysis of reality, and has been degraded to a mere illustration of a thesis. Whereas Balzac does not really know what he will find beforehand. The Avant-Propos to the Comédie humaine shows that his aim is one</page><page sequence="26">28 FREDRIC JAMESON of a typology, of a vast zoology of human society, but that the vast energies of the work are released by the idea of a method, rather than the discovery ahead of time of a kind of table of the basic elements. Moreover Balzac's feeling for historicity and for historical change is so intense that he would be incapable of imagining a fixed archetype of the social types, of the petit bourgeois for example: the petit bourgeois in his work is always characteristic of a given period, of a given decade, he is in constant evolution, in his clothing style, in his house furnish- ings, in his language and mentality, from the days of Napoleon to the last years of Louis-Philippe. Thus a Balzac character is not typical of a certain kind of fixed social element, such as class, but rather of the historical moment itself; and with this, the purely thematic and allegorical overtones to the notion of typicality disappear completely. The typical is not at this point a one-to-one correlation between indi- vidual characters in the work (Nucingen, Hulot) and fixed, stable components of the external world itself (finance aristocracy, Napoleonic nobility), but rather an analogy between the entire plot, as a conflict of forces, and the total moment of history itself considered as process. At this point, it would perhaps be well to observe that this entire discussion of the content of works of art is in reality a formal one: if we began by seeming to discuss content, it was because of the nature of the historical novel or play itself, in which a built-in distinction between form and content is maintained in its very structure. For where the ordinary novel gives the illusion of absolutely disengaged reading, of a self-sufficient work which needs no object or model in the outside world, the historical novel is characterized by the manner in which it always holds such a model, such a basic external reality, before our eyes in the very act of reading it. It does not matter whether we have no intellectual interest whatsoever in the historical exactitude of Scott's pictures of the middle ages, of Flaubert's Carthage, we cannot help but intuit this external reality, we cannot help but intend a real object (in the Husserlian sense), no matter how emptily and vaguely: the very structure of our reading of the historical novel involves com- parison, involves a kind of judgement of being. Thus, when we leave this specialized form and turn to the realistic novel in general, we may restate the above discussion in purely formal terms: but in these terms, the human elements of the work, the char- acters, become raw materials just like any others, just like, for example, the material descriptions in the book, and the notion of the typical, no longer quite appropriate for this more general formal point of view, gives way to another kind of terminology. Here, the principal</page><page sequence="27">The Case for George Lukacs 29 characteristic of literary realism is seen to be its anti-symbolic quality; realism itself comes to be distinguished by its movement, its story- telling and dramatization of its content; comes, following the title of one of Lukacs' finest essays, to be characterized by Narration rather than Description. It is perhaps easiest to begin with the negative part of the definition, with that hostile diagnosis of symbolism which will be a constant throughout Lukacs' career: for him, symbolism is not just one literary technique among others, but represents a qualitatively different mode of apprehending the world from the realistic one. Symbolism, we may say, is always a second best, always a kind of admission of defeat on the part of the novelist: for by having recourse to it the writer implies that some original, objective meaning in objects is henceforth inacces- sible to him, that he must invent a new and fictive one to conceal this basic absence, this basic silence of things. The symbolic mode is of course not so much the result of the writer's personal esthetic as it is that of the historical situation itself: in their origin, all objects have a human meaning. Even nature itself is humanized, in the manner by which man makes his home within it, by which he converts it to his own use (thus the rocky and barren landscape of Greece is turned inside out like a glove, domesticated, by an economy that adapts to it with sea-faring and commerce, artisinal production). This original meaningfulness of objects becomes visible only when their link with human labor and production is unconcealed. But in modern industrial civilization this link is hard to find: objects appear to lead an inde- pendent life of their own, and it is precisely this illusion which is the source of the symbolic. In Zola, the mine comes to be felt as a beast, nightmarishly inhabiting the landscape, devouring human flesh. In Joyce, the newspaper office comes to seem the cave of the winds: whatever realistic, historical meaning it also possesses has come to seem too drab and prosaic for the work of art. Henceforth the furniture in the Spoils of Poynton, the brooding cities of Dickens and Dostoyevsky, the morally expressive landscapes of a Gide or a D. H. Lawrence, exist self-sufficient in the work of art, carry their meaning built into them. Even the neutral objects of a Robbe-Grillet are the result of this symbolizing process: for they also reply, but by silence, and the eye continues to search them for some obsessive pattern, some immediate visual comprehensibility, which remains forever in doubt. Thus symbolism results, not from the properties of the things them- selves, but from the will of the creator, who imposes a meaning on</page><page sequence="28">30 FREDRIC JAMESON them by fiat: it represents the vain attempt of subjectivity to evolve a human world completely out of itself. In this, it is much like the earlier middle class ethic of the moral imperative, the Ideal or the Sollen, which Lukács criticizes in the Theory of the Novel. In sym- bolic works of art, we strive for some meaningful relationship to the outside world, to objective reality, only to return empty-handed, having lived our life among shadows, having touched nothing but ourselves of the world around us. This is perhaps the moment to comment on the rejection of modern art and of modernism in general which is implicit in this idea of Lukács. In the Castle of Kafka, after one of the characters has shown K. that all of his actions can be interpreted in a quite different, and far more unfavorable light, the hero replies: "It's not that what you say is false: it's just that it's hostile." Such might be the motto for Lukács' attitude toward modern art. It is both diagnosis and judge- ment: yet the whole dimension of judgement rests on an ambiguity, for it presupposes that the modernist writer has some personal choice in the matter, and that his fate is not sealed for him by the logic of his moment in history. The same ambiguity is visible in Marxist revolutionary theory as well, where the revolution cannot come into being until all the objective conditions are ripe for it, and where yet at the same time Lenin can apparently force this condition by sheer will-power, can create a proletarian revolution before the preceding middle-class one has had time to run its course. If therefore we set aside that part of Lukács' work which constitutes a set of recommendations to the artist (and which is complicated by the fact that Lukács aims here at two publics at once: at the writers of socialist realism just as much as the "critical realists" of the West), we find that his analysis of modernism is based on a fundamental fact of modern art: namely the observation of a qualitative leap in recent times, of an absolute difference between that literature which is ours, and which began around the time of Baudelaire and Flaubert, and the classical literature which preceded it. No doubt, depending on the width of our historical lens, this absolute break can be located earlier, perhaps around the beginning of the 19th century, with the French revolution and German romanticism: in this connection it is significant that the attitude of Lukács reproduces almost exactly that of Goethe and Hegel towards romanticism itself. Classicism is the healthy, said Goethe, romanticism the sick. And Hegel criticized the subjectivism of the romantics in much the same terms which Lukács reserves for the modernists. The judgement is the inevitable one</page><page sequence="29">The Case for George Lukacs 31 which a philosophy of the concrete must pass on the abstract, and it should be added that it is very often precisely from a relatively old-fashioned, anti-contemporary, even reactionary viewpoint (see Yvor Winters and, indeed, Edmund Burke himself) that the most penetrating analyses of the actual are made. The advantage of Lukács over sympathetic theoreticians of the modern lies in his possibility to compare. He is not inside the modern phenomenon, completely given over to its fundamental values, able to see it only through its own eyes: he can define it and limit it off as a historical moment against that which it is not; yet such comparisons will always, in their very structure, seem to imply a judgement on the side of the older term. At this point it should be noticed that Lukács' criticism of modern- ism was already implicit in the Theory of the Novel itself: we showed how the four typological chapters tended to fall into two groups, the first (on the two basic types) apprehending man's relationship to the world in a metaphysical way, the second (on Goethe and Tolstoy) seeing it in social or historical terms. It was no accident that the first two chapters were so rich in suggestions and intimations of modern- ism: for modern or symbolic art is precisely characterized by its a-historical, metaphysical way of viewing human life in the world. The distinction between realism and symbolic modernism was there- fore already present in the shift towards a novel which apprehended reality, and the human environment, in terms of human history. Thus, by a kind of detour, we find that the basic methodology of the earlier work, the separation between soul and world, meaning and life, retains its vitality in the later writings: it has merely gone under- ground, shed its familiar Hegelian terminology, and will continue to inform the distinction between symbolism and realism, between a merely willed synthesis between meaning and life, and one which is somehow present in a concrete way in the historical situation itself. Yet for Lukacs the symbolic mode of presentation is itself merely a symptom of some deeper underlying mode of apprehension which he will call Description, that is, a purely static contemplative way of looking at life and experience which is the equivalent in literature to the attitude of bourgeois objectivity in philosophical thought. For the realistic mode of presentation, the possibility of narration itself, is present only in those moments of history in which human life can be apprehended in terms of concrete, individual confrontations and dramas, in which some basic general truth of life can be told through the vehicle of the individual story, the individual plot. Yet such</page><page sequence="30">32 FREDRIC JAMESON moments have been relatively rare in modern times: and there are others in which nothing real ever seems to happen, in which life is felt as waiting without end, perpetual frustration of the ideal (Flau- bert) ; in which the only reality of human existence seems to be blind routine and the drudgery of daily work, forever the same day after day (Zola); in which finally the very possibility of events seems to have disappeared, and the writer seems relatively reconciled to a framework in which the truth of the single day can stand as the microcosm of life itself (Joyce). In these historical situations, even when the literary work itself seems violent and agitated, such ex- plosions will turn out on closer inspection to be mere imitations of events, pseudo-events, imposed from above by the novelist who despairs of evolving any genuine events from the colorless stream of experience itself. Indeed, melodrama (as in Zola) is one of the principle devices by which modern literature has sought to conceal its contradictions: the violent clash between larger-than-life collective units (the mob in Germinal, the barbarians in Salammbô), or between absolute Good and Evil, conceals the absence of any genuine human interrelationship on the individual level, in individual lived experience. And where modernism resolutely assumes its situation, it abandons plot entirely, renounces narration in the older sense, and seeks to make a strength from its basic weakness. Thus description, as a dominant mode of representation, is the sign that some vital relationship to action and to the possibility of action has broken down. Lukács compares the horse race in Zola's Nana with the similar episode in Anna Karenina: the first is a brilliant set- piece observed from the outside, it has little to do with the fates of the characters. In the second, the characters are passionately involved: lengthy external descriptions are unnecessary because we feel the intensity of the event, not through visual contemplation, but through the hopes and expectations of the characters themselves. Thus descrip- tion begins when external things are felt to be alienated from human activity, come to be viewed as static things-in-themselves; but it is fulfilled when even the human beings who inhabit these lifeless settings become themselves dehumanized, become lifeless tokens, mere objects in motion to be rendered from the outside. Lukacs tends to account for the realistic, genuinely narrative mo- ments in literature in two ways: from the personal situation and attitudes of the writers themselves, and from their objective historical situation. The analysis of the subjective precondition of realism forms a parallel to the analysis of the preconditions of knowledge of the</page><page sequence="31">The Case for George Lukacs 33 totality in History and Class Consciousness, although on the literary plane the explanation may seem relatively simplistic: the great real- ists, Lukacs tells us, are those who somehow fully participated in the life of their times, who were not mere observers, but were actors also, were "engaged" in a far less limited and political sense than in Sartre's familiar usage. Yet in his examples of such engagement, Lukacs thinks his materialism through to a consequent and even paradoxical con- clusion: if it is the material substructure, the social situation, that takes precedence over mere opinion, ideology, the subjective picture someone has of himself, then we may logically be forced to conclude that under certain circumstances a conservative, a royalist, a believing Catholic, can better seize the genuine forces at work in society than a writer whose sympathies are relatively socialistic. This is the ulti- mate force of Lukacs' comparison between Balzac and Zola: it may seem wilful and perverse to claim that the champion of Dreyfus was detached from the basic issues of his time. Yet even so unpolitical a writer as Henry James shrewdly observed not only that Zola's political engagement followed the end of his creative career in litera- ture, serving as a substitute for the latter, but that it also seemed to reflect some nagging sense of unfulnllment in the writer's private life as well, some feeling that he had never really come to grips with genuine Experience. And there can be no question that Zola's methods of work (a kind of rationalistic division of labor, choice of theme before characters, careful background documentation and notes, a visit to the locale, and so forth) are those of the observing outsider rather than the imaginative participant. Whereas Balzac, for all his intellec- tual and moral criticism of the middle-class age, the secular corruption of the July Monarchy, lived out its basic ambitions and drives in his very bones, in his life passions, dreaming of the riches of the Sardinian silver-mines, of a quick fortune made in the theater, feverishly col- lecting spurious treasures, furnishing one house after another, long- ing for the ultimate stability of the landed proprietor, finding the causal forces of his moment in history already full-blown within himself, without having to observe them in others, from the outside. No doubt it is vain to recommend such a life as a model for the realistic writer, as Lukács sometimes seems to do: but it should be pointed out that newer kinds of psychological analyses, such as that which Sartre has made of Flaubert, are merely refinements, using psychoanalytic techniques, on this basic model: thus the formal prac- tice of Flaubert is seen as reflecting his detachment from the possibil- ities of lived action in his situation as a second son to whom the</page><page sequence="32">34 FREDRIC JAMESON practical fulfillments of middle class life seemed denied. But this subjective disposition of the realistic writer is only the reverse of the objective possibilities of the historical situation in which he lives, and which his work reflects. Balzac's historical luck was to have witnessed, not the later, fully evolved and finished capitalism of the time of Flaubert and Zola, but the very beginnings of capitalism in France, to have been contemporary with a social transformation which permitted him to see objects, not as completed material sub- stances, but as they issued from human work, to have been able to apprehend social change as a network of individual stories. We can dramatize this by saying that in Balzac, factories do not yet exist as such: we watch not the end products but the efforts of the great capitalists and inventors to construct them: social and economic reality is still relatively transparent, the result of human activity still visible to the naked eye. But the only factory in the works of Flaubert is that pottery works which is but a passing stage in Arnoux's checkered career, and through which Frédéric passes with infinite boredom, attentive only to Madame Arnoux's eyes and hands as she patiently explains the mechanics of production (" 'Ce sont les patouillards', she said. He found the word grotesque, somehow wholly unsuitable in her mouth."). Like Frédéric, Flaubert is condemned by his historical situation to a life of monotonous tourism amid industrial monuments that mean nothing to him. And as has already been shown, when Zola, impatient with this massive lifelessness, tries to breathe vitality into it, he can only do so by having recourse to myth and melodramatic violence. Thus realism is dependent on the possibility of access to the forces of change in a given moment of history: at the time of Balzac such forces are those of beginning capitalism, but the nature of the forces is not itself so important: for in another situation, Tolstoy's literary vitality comes from the existence in Russian society of the rising class of the peasantry, with which he identifies himself in a Utopian and religious manner, but whose very presence gives him a strength inaccessible to his Western contemporaries. (Here also, it should be noted that the analysis of the Theory of the Novel is maintained: except that for the relatively metaphysical formulation of a primal Nature in Tolstoy's environment, Lukács here substitutes the social reality behind the ideal of Nature and the natural life, namely the peasantry itself.) Thus that ideal of the concrete which was inscribed in the Theory of the Novel as a will to reestablish epic narration remains intact in</page><page sequence="33">The Case for George Lukacs 35 the later theory of realism, where it is shown, in the sense of History and Class Consciousness, and indeed, like revolutionary praxis itself, to depend on those privileged historical moments in which access to society as a totality may once again somehow be reinvented. Thus Lukács' work confirms the opinion of no less an expert than Martin Heidegger himself, who saw in Marxism not merely a political or economic theory but above all an ontology and an original mode of recovering our relationship to Being itself.4 But of such an opening onto Being, now conceived as a social and historical substance, it is narration which is both the formal sign and the concrete expression. 4 Brief über den Humanismus, 27.</page></plain_text>
