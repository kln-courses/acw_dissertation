<plain_text><page sequence="1">WITHIN AND BEYOND Felix Gonzalez-Torres's "Crowd" Christopher Ho In one of his best-known works, Felix Gonzalez-Torres installed thirteen black- and-white photographs at Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York, each depicting a single, carved laudatory word from the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial at the Museum of Natural History on the Upper West Side. Devoid of people, the photographs' concern seemed resolutely formal: the spatial tension between the flatness of the pictures' surfaces and the actual curve of the semi-circular wall depicted, emphasized by the concurrence of the wall's cornice and the photographs' top edges. A week later, however, Gonzalez-Torres struck all but three photographs: "Soldier," "Humanitarian," and "Explorer." A celestial blue box, the upper perim- eter of which was lined with light bulbs, was placed at the center of the room. Part minimalist box, part pop-art camp, this installation was enhanced by the gyrations of a go-go dancer, who briefly appeared atop each day wearing only silver briefs and a Sony Walkman. And if this performance playfully re-coded the stolid virtues fronting one of New York's foremost museums,1 so the institution of art in general received further assault on the third week of the exhibition. A rectangular pool of silver-wrapped candies now covered nearly half the floor of the emptied space. Gallery goers were invited to take these candies, and depending on the number of visitors and their constitutions, the shape of the installation altered, only to be replenished and reformed into a rectangle at closing in preparation for the next day. At first glance, Gonzalez-Torres's Every Week There Is Something Different (1991) appears to fall into the broad category of Conceptual Art, which came to the fore in the decade between 1965-75.2 Indeed, the morphological shifts it undergoes-from the straightforward presentation of art photography to an installation which actively engages gallery visitors-aptly graphs the key tendencies of this art: the "withdrawal of the visual" and the "suppression of the [contemplative] beholder."3 But unlike the ironic tenor or overt polemicism of, say, a Mel Bochner or a Hans Haacke, the passage from the photographs, which appeal to the disembodied eye, to the interactive candies, which involve the oral orifice and the body's alimentary tract, is mediated by erotics of the go-go dancer. The pivot from the verticality (so long associated with the purely visual) of the photographs on the wall to the horizontal plane of the candies on the floor enacts man's supposed devolution from rational being to libidinal animal in the change of axis from standing upright to laying in * 1</page><page sequence="2">bed. And what more appropriately marks the move from the autonomous artwork to the inclusion of the receiving subject than the erotic, the logical denouement of which would literally take place in three-dimensional reality? (One never sees, for example, the end of a good porn.) But it is less sex than sexuality that interests Gonzalez-Torres, whose own homosexuality and HIV+ status provided an undercurrent to his works, spinning them with a consistent if vague political dimension and allying them with feminist- inflected art as much as the works' forms veered toward (proto-)conceptual trappings. Though again, it is difficult to pin down Gonzalez-Torres, for although his reliance on the photographic and the found image follows the lead of Louise Lawler, Sherry Levine, and Barbara Kruger, there is a subjective depth and visual expression absent in his feminist counterparts. Consider Untitled (1991), consisting of an enlarged photograph of an empty bed with two nearly identical pillows indented with the shape of heads displayed on twenty-four billboards around New York City in conjunction with the exhibition Projects 34: Felix Gonzalez-Torres. This piece (clearly in dialogue with Daniel Buren's 1968 project in which 400 striped posters were scattered around Paris), rehearses the axis shift from vertical (billboard) to horizontal (bed) from Every Weeks There Is Something Different, as well, it collapses public and private. Obliquely referring to the recent death of Ross Laycock, the artist's long-time companion, it derives in part from the autobiographical. Sugges- tive of homoeroticism (insofar as the paired pillows are the same), its strength nonetheless lies not in strategies of identity politics but in what might be termed the return of auratic prerogatives to Conceptual Art's "aesthetics of administration."4 Indeed, I will argue that Gonzalez-Torres's recent exhibition at Andrea Rosen (the second after his death) reorients the artist's work away from feminist strategies of photographic appropriation and the attendant polemics of proving the false neutrality of the visual sphere and the image repertoire to a photographic model theorized in Walter Benjamin's 1931 "A Short History of Photography." The exhibition, focusing on works incorporating crowd images, highlights one poignant theme raised by Conceptual Art: the impossibility of maintaining critical distance- the traditional role of the avant-garde-when, historically, such a position is obliterated by the ever-broadening tentacles of the culture industry and, art- historically, the pendulum is beginning to swing the other way-witness the return to expressionist painting or the widespread aestheticization of montage techniques in photography. The argument, then, resolves these two related phenomena-the former which signals the death of the avant-garde, the latter which blithely pretends it never existed at all-by posing one as the antidote to the other. It claims that Gonzalez-Torres deploys art's mnemonic and poetic dimension (hitherto simply trashed in 70s post-modernism or abused by 80s neo-expressionism) to cleave that distance necessary for criticality. To make such a claim is to suggest a dialectical advancement and a paradigm shift: Gonzalez-Torres resuscitates practices of institu- tional critique enacted by Conceptual Art and feminist works alike (of the museum- gallery-patron and the hegemonic, masculine discourses which structure that nexus); he reformulates them as well. Paving the way for much art of the 90s, he 2 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="3">takes a purely spatial model of critique, which stipulates that subversion must involve participation and that unveiling must come from within rather than from a detached and elevated vantage (witness Buren's reliance on the museological frame or Kruger's mimesis of advertising strategies), and augments to it a temporal dimension, in which art's mnemonic faculty, as in Benjamin's description of the outmoded debris of modernity, possesses a radically disruptive potential-a poten- tial which comes from behind, which "brings the immense force of 'atmosphere' concealed in these things to the point of explosion."5 Not so long ago, it seemed as if Conceptual Art was dead, washed aside not only by a return to large-scale paintings, as epitomized by Julian Schnabel and David Salle in the 80s-with all their implications of creative genius, expressive transcendence, and, not insignificantly, Wall Street cash to match-but riven by internal exhaus- tion. For some, Conceptual Art brought modernism's reductivist tendencies to their logical end: the total negation of the art object. In this sense, the goals of (Greenbergian) modernism and the avant-garde intention to merge the artistic and socio-political spheres (the unifying scaffolding of Constructivism, Dada, and to some extent Surrealism) finally collude in a happy if ultimately mutually destructive truce. For the artist-critic Jeff Wall, the narrative of this double end is inexorably intertwined with photography. If conventional wisdom provides that it was photography's ability to produce near-perfect imitations of external reality that pushed painting into abstraction and internal issues of composition and medium specificity-in sum, into autonomy-photography (or more specifically photojour- nalism, art photography's de-aestheticized counterpart), for the avant-garde, also signaled the ultimate de-skilling of the artist. This near-complete withdrawal of authorial control, of emphasis on academic training and technical sophistication, deflated the artist into the everyman and thrust art into the everyday: "you push the button," promised Kodak, "and we do the rest." Rather than opposing these two strains of the photographic legacy, Wall claims one as the amplification of the other. Noting that gaming with the "anaesthetic"-the condition and look of non-art-was integral to the modernist project, Wall sees Conceptual Art's appropriation of photojournalism as finessing even Minimalism's extreme critique of arts legitimacy, in which "the techniques and abilities most intimately identified with [the fine arts] were placed into question."6 The issue of the game-of tempting art's boundaries-is indeed crucial in this account; for Wall, even as Conceptual Art purported to merge art with life through photography, historically, it turned toward photojournalism just as that field underwent a professionalization. Thus Conceptual Art received photojournalism as an aesthetic, in effect preserving art's supposed rarified sphere, its autonomy, and the artist's position of control and manipulation. Worse, if this gambit failed in its purported avant-gardist claim to merge art and life, it also (re)injected a lethal virus into modernism proper (of which Conceptual Art is now revealed as a part).

Thus photo-Conceptualism (such as Ed Ruscha's banal images of gasoline stations), according to Wall, marks the apogee of art under modernism's aegis. True to this dire conclusion, since the late 70s, Wall has produced luminous back-lit transparency boxes which hark back to pre-modern, narrative-laden history paintings, in which the Picture returns to pick up where modernism, now seen as an isolated aberration, splintered off. Wall's conflation of Conceptual Art and modernism at large might seen strange, for the former has often been considered if not the antithesis of at least somewhat inimical to the latter. Though no less doomed, this account poses Conceptual Art as a neo-avant-garde revival of historical-avant-gardist tactics of, among others, reducing art to serially produced objects (in critical identification with the commodity and its apparatus of presentation and distribution) and illuminating art's context (whether physical, institutional, or legal). In sum, it considers Conceptual Art to be an extension of the Duchampian readymade. Though even here, distinctions must be made. Dividing Duchamp into, on the one hand, his unassisted readymades and, on the other, his painted work and assisted readymades, critic Benjamin Buchloh allies Joseph Kosuth and the British group Art &amp; Language with the first category, and Marcel Broodthaers, Buren, and Haacke, with the second. Kosuth's art-propositions, based on Wittgenstein's Tractatus, for instance, presents the extreme of the positivist trajectory of modernism, in which Greenbergian self- reflexivity is simply transposed from the perceptual to the discursive sphere, resulting ultimately in verbal rather than visual tautology; indeed, Kosuth takes Ad Reinhardt's "Art as Art," the summa of American formalism, and translates it in 1966 into "Art as Idea as Idea." On the other hand, the second group of conceptual artists shifts focus from art's internal delimitation to its adventitious support, which is to say, extending Duchamp's strategy of allying art to contemporary modes of industrial production and consumption, they further highlight art's legal organiza- tion and institutional validation. Like Wall, Buchloh draws a lineage from Minimalism, though here it is seen less as the last breath of pure modernism (before its vitiation by photography) than as already having eroded art's autonomy. Thus what Haacke's 1969-70 Visitors' Profiles takes from say, a Donald Judd, is not the concern of delimiting the parameters of art, but rather the expansion of art into its context-the interchange between audience, object, and architectural frame.7 (This shift of focus is mediated by the former's post-minimal, proto-conceptual Condensa- tion Cube [1963-65], which literally injects the minimalist cube with water which rises and falls according to the number of people in the gallery and the resultant variation in room temperature.) Yet even this story of revival (of Duchampian tactics) nevertheless dovetails with Wall's account of demise (of modernist reductivism), for both end on a downbeat. Not only does the reduction of the artist into a clerk (in Haacke's case, cataloguing the statistics of each gallery visitor) seem inimical to Conceptual Art's subversive and HO / Within and Beyond * 5</page><page sequence="6">radical claims, so does its deadpan aesthetic mimic, perhaps too closely, the "totally administered world," to use Adorno's phrase, which it attempts to belie (for instance, the quasi-scientific field known as "visitor behavior studies" that seeks to measure and manage museum attendees). Thus even as Conceptual Art debunks the modernist escape into transcendental autonomy, its attempt to expose the ideologi- cal functions and effects of capitalism is undermined first by the total extinguishing of the subject and with it the possibility for a critical voice, and second by its over- identification to the inner workings of global capital, rendering it all but indistin- guishable from what it seeks to critique.8 To cite these accounts is not only to underscore Conceptual Art's demise, but to sketch the constellation of terms from which Gonzalez-Torres's works arise and which they ultimately reshuffle. On the one hand, resistant to refuting the historical precedence of Conceptual Art entirely and returning to what amounts to a new kind of painting with its auratic and manifestly retinal surfaces, as does Wall; on the other, equally weary of the wholesale extinguishing of a poetico-transcendental dimension and the slide into an "aesthetic of administration," in heed of Buchloh, Gonzalez-Torres navigates these poles; and he does so precisely through using the one as the antidote to the other. To this effect, photography acts as the fulcrum in two ways. First, it (re)introduces the referent, effectively extending the target of Conceptual Art's institutional critique beyond the frame of art's apparatus; in this sense, Gonzalez-Torres takes the lead of much feminist art. Secondly, and more originally, photography returns an element of the auratic into Conceptual Art, though-and this is the point-not in the way Wall proposes. For here, auratic traces function to cleave a critical distance between the receiving subject and the artwork-precisely that distance which Conceptual Art's identification with its object of critique disallowed. These two points, the referential and the auratic, constitute Gonzalez-Torres's key contributions to sustaining the legacy of Concep- tual Art. Conceptual Art's problem, with which Buchloh's essay concludes, paradoxically emerged first as a solution to Minimal Art, which almost from the outset was articulated as positing two mutually exclusive positions: of masterly overview and sovereign vantage, in the tradition of Renaissance perspective; and of imbrication, which announced the ultimate breakdown of the arts' boundaries.9 Clearly, Conceptual Art (as, it might be noted, its historical precedents, Constructivist and Productivist works) opted for the latter stance; not only was it involved in a phenomenological inquiry into subjective response (as in Minimalism), but it also actively sought to highlight art's institutional site and economic logic-to shift focus "from work to frame."'0 Yet this was immediately complicated by Conceptual Art's wish to be critical, to pose itself against bourgeois culture. How to critique when one is complicit, where is the critical distance? It is this issue which Buren, whose works constitute a crucial precedent for Gonzalez-Torres's billboard projects, addresses. 6 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="7">Aiming for what Siegfried Kracauer termed "a kind of distraction which exposes disintegration rather than masking it," Buren straddles the two options Minimalism leaves. Within and Beyond the Frame (1973), for instance, as the title indicates, is literally located in part in John Weber Gallery and in part outside of it, not only extending the parameters of an exhibition beyond the museum's walls but, more importantly, underscoring the bounded discourse of the modern gallery (where business meets fashion meets art) and its elitist separation from the everyday. And yet Gonzalez-Torres's billboard works-which include Untitled (The New Plan) (1991), Untitled(1992), and Untitled (For Jeff) (1992)-though structurally similar (insofar as they were part of larger exhibitions in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Kassel respectively), diverge in one crucial way: they incorporate a photographic image. Though no less readymades than Buren's striped canvases (distinguished from actual awnings only by their inconspicuously painted edges), Gonzalez-Torres's photo-billboards are insistently referential; more, their images are neither just stock- and-trade cliches nor aleatory snapshots, but directed towards a gay audience. The jeans from Untitled (The New Plan), as Nancy Spector notes, refer to a common uniform for gay men, just as the shadowy figure in Untitled might allude to loss in the light of AIDS; finally, the person referred to and whose hand appears in Untitled (For Jeff), in fact nursed a friend of the artist through his final illness.11 This gesture towards a sub-culture, though attenuated at times to mere insinuation, pervades not only the works that literally make use of photography, but the artist's entire oeuvre. Consider Untitled (Double Portrait) (1991), for instance, which aptly graphs the disintegration of the minimalist cube into its environs. A stack of endlessly replenishable papers to be taken by its viewers, it at first resembles such Conceptual Art projects as Buren's 1975 Baile Is in Manhattan, which features a group of "picketers" holding up striped panels. Yet printed on each sheet are two conjoined circles, which might, as the title suggests, be extremely reduced diagrams of (same sex?) heads. The injection of the anthropomorphic, however tenuous, nonetheless allows the work to read as something more than purely formal. It is nearly impossible, given the endless papers, to avoid seeing the circles as the common symbol for infinity; and this second injection, of the temporal, is only confirmed by Gonzalez-Torres's work of the same year, Untitled (Perfect Lovers), in which the circles appear as two round clocks ticking in unison next to each other. The anthropomorphic and the temporal of course, were the two terms to which Minimalism's detractors called attention;12 and it is precisely these terms which poignantly reappear in Gonzalez-Torres's 1994 Untitled (21 Days of Bloodwork- Steady Decline). Taking the high-modern, self-referential square grid, that quintes- sential mark of atemporality, the artist vectors it with an index of time and the body's decay. (In this sense, this work retains a structural connection to photography through the indexical.) Though here, time is not cast as infinite: for a generation familiar with the devastating effects of AIDS, the descending line in these graphs unmistakably signals diminishing T-cells in the blood, leading to sickness, even to death. HO / Within and Beyond a 7</page><page sequence="8">Gonzalez-Torres's method (only glossed here) of placing art "in drag," to use his own phrase, expands Conceptual Art's critical project beyond the frame of art's institu- tions and delves into the larger ideological discourses (of power and domination, of gender construction, of sexual dispossession) which buttress those institutions. On this score, he clearly takes cue from contemporaneous feminist art, which likewise make Roland Barthes's secondary mystification a central strategy.13 Yet if feminist art debunked the purported neutrality of the visual sphere along the lines of gender, Gonzalez-Torres's works further appeal to a social group (i.e., gays) not necessarily part of the artworld. In welcoming non-privileged spectators into a straight male audience, the artist resolves one shortcoming of Conceptual Art, which was often accused of being unable to communicate to-much less transform the consciousnesses of-an "alternative public not composed of the participants in its own projects and deliberations."14 More, the issue of deploying a coded language distinguishes Gonzalez-Torres's projects from conceptual and feminist practices alike. The difference between conceptual artists and Gonzalez-Torres is that although both take the strategy of subversion from within, the former turns the language of the institution against itself while the latter adds another layer to that language (that of allegory, the result of montage and appropriation),'5 thus unraveling the paradox between imbrication and masterly overview that emerges with Conceptual Art's attempt to both involve itself and retain a critical voice. The difference between feminist art and Gonzalez-Torres's works is that although both, through the method of re-coding, are intent on exposing the male domination of the visual sphere and that sphere's function as an instrument of subjugation and control, the latter further speaks in a code.'6 And it is this cleft, between the languages of the critical and the criticized, however slight and guarded, which Gonzalez-Torres presses on another level too. The model sketched above-culled in part from the practices of identity politics- is problematic in several ways, blatant among them contradictions on the level of the sign. For even as it focuses on the instability of the signifier (in its attempt to debunk modernist autonomy and symbolic totality), it insists on its readability (if only by a marginal audience).17 However conflicted this might be, it is symptomatic of Gonzalez-Torres's systematic and conscious address of the problems arising with Conceptual Art. To this end, he develops a more sophisticated approach, again drawing from photography. Ironically and paradoxically, the artist's photographs raise less the issue of referentiality than of aura: ironically, because photography's reproducibility was supposed to extinguish aura, eradicating any semblance of authenticity, uniqueness, and autonomy upon which that concept rests; and paradoxically, because Gonzalez-Torres's return to the auratic might not be regres- sive, as it is in Wall, but progressive, providing the critical distance Conceptual Art ultimately lacked. (Indeed, one characteristic of aura is "the unique appearance of a 8 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="9">Felix Gonzalez-Torres, "Untitled" (Beginning), 1994.

HO / Within and Beyond * 9</page><page sequence="10">distance, however close at hand."18) What distinguishes a simple return to out- moded artisanal forms and a critical application of those forms? Perhaps the most poignant and certainly the most influential argument for the destruction of aura was advanced in Walter Benjamin's 1936 "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," which admonished that art not only reflect but internalize contemporaneous techno-scientific developments against the threat of war. This dire implication-that a retreat into artistic autonomy results in massive human destruction-turns on the essay's central opposition, between the aestheti- cization of politics and the politicization of aesthetics. On a local level, this manifests itself in the difference between traditional art-which absorbs a contem- plative beholder-and art which "a distracted mass absorbs."'9 The former model allows the people to view their own destruction "as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order."20 Under the misguided tenet lVartpour lart, aesthetics palliate the profoundest crimes against humanity, allowing them to be perpetrated as discontinuous from actuality-as object-events to be contemplated at a distance (a situation the alienation modernity heralds only exacerbates). In contrast to sublimating life into art, Benjamin argues for art which encroaches onto life, which blurs the boundaries between artist, artwork, and audience. Relieved of traditional criteria such as formal elegance and internal coherency-and of its auratic trappings-art can instead turn to adventitious concerns: politics. Clearly, the model advanced by Benjamin intends a double transformation: of the artist from shaman to producer, and the viewer from contemplative individual to collective mass. Yet this is only one facet of aura; there are others that deal less with authorial voice and its correlative singular beholder, or at least which cast these terms differently. Is there a possibility for an aura without authority, of a de-authorial aura? I think there is, and here we shall turn-finally-to the recent exhibition at Andrea Rosen. To be sure, Gonzalez-Torres's works laterally connect with modern modes of sense perception, as Benjamin advocates. Consider Untitled (Double Fear) (1987), Untitled(1986), and Untitled(1990), which take as their subject matter crowds, that commonplace of urban life. The first two include circular photographs taken from a slightly elevated angle of teeming heads, while the last centers around a small photocopied verbal descriptions of a simmering riot outside of one of Donald Trump's new gambling resorts.21 All three incorporate the newspaper-the photo- graphs are in fact cutouts, and the photocopy is from a column. (Here it is important to recall that, for Benjamin, the newspaper was the only valid form of modern "literature," its staccato stories and urgent tone, the juxtaposition of often unrelated columns under attention-grabbing headlines, and its quotidian and manifestly disposable nature, all aptly counterpointing the inundation of stimuli and barrage of small shocks which constitute everyday life.) Just as Untitled (Double Fear) represents crowds overflowing the close crop of the photograph, a reminder of urban overpopulation, the grid of circular clocks in Untitled (1986) suggests globalization and its not unrelated effect of uprootedness: it recalls similar clocks likewise set at different time zones found in hotel lobbies and airports, those generic, 10 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="11">multinational spaces of transience. And if these works thematize certain modern phenomena, Untitled (1990) enacts others on a literal level as well. Its modes of address (journalistic), production (mechanically reproduced), and distribution (paper stacks to be dissipated), systematically undermine art's purported rarefaction, uniqueness, and autonomy. And yet this reading falls short, privileging one aspect of Gonzalez-Torres's work in exclusion of others. For all Untitled (Double Fear)s incorporation of the informative, tell-all disposition of newspapers, the print's slightly beige tint and the cropping of the indistinct images leaves the viewer on a lurch: are these from an historical event (the Kennedy assassination, the counter-cultural riots of the 60s)? The constellation of different sized circles within the circular canvas evokes the spots left in the eye after staring at glaring light; and this afterimaging is not only physiological but historical as well, prompting various modalities of remembering. Likewise, the subject of time from Untitled (1986) returns in Untitled (1986-87) in a markedly different guise. To be sure, the newsprint of crowds reappears; but here, it is slipped inside a glass bottle, recasting the jet-setting pace and urban center hop (from New York to Frankfurt to Hong Kong) alluded to in the former work into the slow and meandering route of a bottle carried by ocean currents-into a tale of romantic adventure and desert island solitude that comes straight from childhood (in fact, the art historical reference is to Magritte). Finally, can it really be claimed that Untitled (1990) has no aura about it? For it attempts to ease the jumble of the information age, not only distilling the newspaper into a single paragraph, but centering that paragraph on a large (29 x 23 inches) white expanse of paper. Indeed, on its verso side is the following passage: The enormous scale of the problem makes it difficult for people to grasp. "Small corruption is easy to understand and, for politicians, usually fatal," said Ted Van Dyk, a longtime Democratic strategist. "Big corruption is seldom fatal because it is beyond most people's comprehension. People can't understand a $200 billion loss." On one level the connection to the story about Trump's casino (on the recto side) is simple: the equation of gambling and corruption. Yet to read this work as a purveyor of such high moralistic arrogance is to miss its subtlety. In fact, the account involves an impending riot, in which individual accountability is often absolved ("I didn't know what I was doing; I was just caught up in the whirl," runs one common narrative). Like large-scale corruption, the enormity of mass actions disallows critical distance, physical proximity to others precluding the mental space necessary for reflection. (The irony, of course, is that these moments of quietude are supposed to be provided for by a vacation, which in this instance is inappropriately used to gamble, the logic of which-spending money to earn more-echoes capitalism's relentless exchange and circulation.) If there is a moral to the story, it is this: one must distinguish between an unthinking mass and an empowered crowd, a manipulatable collective and a motivated collection of individuals. Surely, when Benjamin wrote "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," he was HO / Within and Beyond * 11</page><page sequence="12">aware of the difference between the former-impeccably enacted at the Nuremberg rallies-and the latter, in which the participant was not merely an actor in an orchestrated production ultimately controlled by a single director, but in which his mental faculty was accorded equal importance as his physical body. It is significant that the auratic imperatives in Gonzalez-Torres's works function to resuscitate only the receiving and not the authorial subject. The crowd photographs which recur in most of the works in the Andrea Rosen exhibition possess a vague, even somber tenor which prompts the viewer's imaginative faculty, a strategy furthered by the designation of works as "Untitled" followed by the most tenuous of interpretative guideposts, a parenthetical phrase or word such as "Double Fear" or "Spaghetti." And this ambiguity, of the blurred images further reinforced by their nondescript titles, inevitably recalls photography's early history; as Benjamin recounts, the first Daguerreotypes "had to be turned this way and that until, in the proper light, a pale gray image could be discerned," and "the first people to be reproduced entered the visual space of photography with their innocence intact, uncompromized by captions."22 Here, in his 1931 essay "A Short History of Photography," is a markedly different account of photography from that of five years later, in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Far from the conception of photography as disrupting the auratic underpinnings of traditional art, its reproducibility eradicating forever any traces of authenticity and originality, it is seen as itself auratic. Though again this aura is not equivalent to that of painting. Rather than contingent on the presence of the artist's unmistakable hand in the photograph, it results from the long exposure times then still necessary, during which the subjects grew, as it were, into the images. Indeed, "no matter how artful the photographer," Benjamin asserts, no matter how carefully posed his subject, the beholder feels an irresistible urge to search such a picture for the tiny spark of contingency, of the Here and Now, with which reality has so to speak seared the subject, to find the inconspicuous spot where in the immediacy of that long-forgotten moment the future subsists so eloquently that we, looking back, may rediscover it.23 This long exposure time, which "caused the subject to focus his life in the moment rather than hurrying past it," parallels the beholder's subsequent engagement in front of the work.24 Many of Gonzalez-Torres's works demand active participation (the paper stacks and candy piles) or allow curatorial latitude (the light strings, beaded curtains, and verbal portraits); more, the images recurring in the photo- graphs-footsteps in deep snow or sand, empty chairs-constitute a visual proscenium to be traversed, their emptiness a welcome quietude which if not alleviates then at least provides a brief respite from the whirl of modernity. It is this rare pocket of privacy which allows the beholder of Untitled (1988) to inspect himself and his surroundings with some critical reflexivity. As a jigsaw puzzle, the mark of mass production is indelibly etched onto the works surface, the jumble of repetitive units subsequently combined into a single object mimicking the 12 * PAJ 67</page><page sequence="13">procedures of a Taylorist factory line. Yet there is a temporal dimension to the piece, too, which is less regulated than leisurely, the final image (again of a crowd) coming to fruition not without some pleasant anticipation on the player's part. And this moment of vague apprehension allows viewers to project themselves and their pasts into the image; as well, here it refers to some collective past, the puzzle not only prompting a psychic regression to childhood but fingering a historical era before television's colonization of spare time. (The putting together of the puzzle might even be seen as a metaphor for the process of constructing history from its disparate detritus, the focus upon which, not incidentally, Benjamin believed could unravel the false totality and historicist continuum of modernism.25) Untitled's deftly paradoxical deployment of the (readymade) puzzle format and the (infinitely reproducible) photograph to invoke pathos and mnemonic rumination functions on the level of the image itself The crowd, that hallmark of modernity, appears for once as mute. What emerges in its silence is a single viewer, who looks back at it-at his surroundings-with clarity. This work originated from my fear of losing everything. This work is about controlling my own fear. My work cannot be destroyed. I have destroyed it already, from day one. The feeling is almost like when you are in a relationship with someone and you know it's not going to work out. From the very beginning you know that you don't really have to worry about it not working out because you simply know that it won't. The person then cannot abandon you, because he has already abandoned you from day one-that is how I made this work.26 So Gonzalez-Torres has poignantly written about his paper stacks. The relinquishing of authorial control is, paradoxically, the only form of control possible. Yet his works are more than cynical gestures, the child's strategy of pre-empting failure by actively embracing it: "If I can't have it, I don't want it." For even as they displace the notion of a single and singular unity with a model of plurality, they do not slide into pluralism. As Douglas Crimp distinguishes, whereas the former posits art's dispersal, the latter entails "the fantasy that art is free, free of other discursive practices and institutions, free above all, of history."27 This fantasy of freedom is predicated on the notion of art as unique, original, and autonomous-as perfectly embodied in Jeff Wall's light boxes, which quote from paintings of the ancien regime through to Delacroix and Seurat, history reduced to a vast shopping mall of styles to consume, a mountainous catalogue of empty signs to plunder. In contrast, Gonzalez-Torres extends Conceptual Art's critical project, countering its tendency towards over-identification with systems of global capitalism by re- introducing a sensate receiving subject; as well as carving a space for critical distance, this return is a critical position itself, posed as it is against the ever-expanding phantasmagoria of commodity culture, the enervation modern experience fosters.

And this reading, for all it is worth, is mine. NOTES 1. As Nancy Spector writes, "In such a contrived and kinky context, the photos quickly acquired different shades of meaning; their bold inscriptions slyly reminded one of the Village People, the late 1970s musical group whose members flaunted and parodied stereotypical macho roles-construction worker, Indian chief, policeman, and so on-with camp bravura." Felix Gonzalez-Torres (New York: Guggenheim, 1995), 101. 2. The dates are from Benjamin Buchloh, "Conceptual Art 1962-1969: From the Aesthetics of Administration to the Critique of Institutions," October 55 (Winter 1990), 105. 3. The terms are, respectively, Benjamin Buchlohs and Charles Harrison's. 4. Again, this phrase is from Buchloh, "Conceptual Art 1962-1969." 5.

For an excellent account of this paradigm shift, see Hal Foster, "The Crux of Minimalism" in The Return of the Real (Cambridge: MIT, 1996), 35-69. 8. And these are only the internal problems with Conceptual Art. Buchloh ends his essay with a not-too-oblique reference to the widespread return to painting in the 80s: "Or worse yet, the Enlightenment-triumph of Conceptual Art-its transformation of audiences and distribution, its abolition of object status and commodity form-would most of all only be shortlived, almost immediately giving way to the return of the ghostlike reapparitions of (prematurely?) displaced painterly and sculptural paradigms of the past. So that the specular regime, which Conceptual Art claimed to have upset, would soon be reinstated with renewed vigor. Which is of course what happened" (Buchloh, "Conceptual Art 1962-1969," 143). 9. This polarity between mental and physical proximity, in which one disallows the other, is notoriously cast in Michael Fried's "Art and Objecthood" (Arforum 5 [June 1967], 12-23) as an opposition between "objecthood" and "theatre." 10. This phrase is Craig Owens's, from "From Work to Frame, or, Is There Life After 'The Death of the Author'?" in Beyond Recognition (Berkeley: University of California, 1992), 122-139. 11.

Charles Harrison, editor of the journal Art-Language, quoted in Thomas Crow, "Unwritten Histories of Conceptual Art: Against Visual Culture" in Modern Art in the Common Culture (New Haven: Yale University, 1996), 215. 15. Allegory was, as Buchloh points out, from the very start a way of speaking under interdiction, of saying surreptitiously what would normally be banned-and thus an instrument for the marginalized ("Allegorical Procedures," 43). 16. As the artist writes of Untitled (Perfect Lovers): "Two clocks side by side are much more threatening to the powers that be than an image of two guys sucking each other's dicks, because they cannot use me as a rallying point in their battle to erase meaning. It is going to be very difficult for members of Congress to tell their constituents that money is being expended for the promotion of homosexual art when all they have to show are two plugs side by side, or two mirrors side by side, or two light bulbs side by side" (Gonzalez-Torres quoted in Spector, 73). 17. In part this conflict is historically bound: Gonzalez-Torres is working at a moment when the post-structuralist model of textuality, seen so far as an avant-gardist disruption of representation, comes under increasing attack, its flattened morphology accused to parallel rather than resist the ever-undifferentiated landscape of late capitalism, and its "play of signifiers" seen to signal rather than refute the total assimilation of art into the "political economy of the commodity-sign" (see, for instance, the respective positions of Fredric Jameson, Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism [Durham: Duke Univer- sity, 1991] and Jean Baudrillard, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, trans. Charles Levin [Saint Louis: Telos, 1981]). Again, then, the question is of maintaining a position of criticality amidst imbrication (the arena has simply shifted from actual institutions to the realm of representation); and just as Gonzalez-Torres deploys art's mnemonic dimension against Conceptual Art's "aesthetic of administration," so does he maintain the referential axis here against feminist art's tendency toward the simulacral. 18.
