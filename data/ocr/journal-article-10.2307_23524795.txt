<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATRIOTIC TENDENCIES IN TARGUM JONATHAN ON THE PROPHETS Moshe Aberbach Baltimore The Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible were designed to educate and elevate the masses who were no longer familiar with Hebrew. Ever since the Second Century B.C.E., the Bible readings at synagogue services included selections from the Prophets, and there was as yet no fixed cycle of readings, so that anyone could recite whatever passages seemed to him most appropriate. The reader would be accompanied by an interpreter — known as the Meturgeman — who would not only translate, but also explain and interpret the text for the benefit of the Aramaic-speaking congregation. Not everything in the Biblical text was deemed suitable for the ears of the uneducated masses. Anthropomorphic and anthropopathic expres sions, for example, had to be reworded to make them theologically unobjectionable. Religious practices in Old Testament times which no longer conformed to those prevailing in the Talmudic era had to be explained away to avoid the pitfalls of undesirable deviations from orthodoxy. Above all, the merciless criticism of ancient Israel by the Prophets had to be toned down in an age when the long-suffering masses wanted messages of comfort and hope rather than predictions of divine punishment and doom. The morale of the people, already shaken by the disasters of the destruction of the Second Commonwealth and the ruin of the Temple of Jerusalem, was subjected to additional strain by sectarian, and especially Christian propaganda, the burden of which was that God had forsaken the Jews and that their only hope for salva tion was to accept the teachings of the new faith. The Aramaic translations of the Bible, which had a long oral history behind them before they were committed to writing, as well as the homiletical Midrashim which consisted primarily of synagogue sermons, were accordingly designed not only to edify the people and improve their practices, but also to raise their morale by making it clear that God had never rejected Israel; that the calamities which had befallen them were "chastisements of love"; and that if only they repented from their sins, the final redemption was, so to say, around the corner.</page><page sequence="2">MOSHE ABERBACH The tendency of the Targumim and particularly of TJ (as well as of the Midrashim) was therefore strongly patriotic — in sharp contrast to the universalist tendency of most of the major Prophets. Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the famous passage in Is. 19:25, which reads as follows: "Blessed be My people Egypt, and the work of My hands Assyria, and My inheritance Israel". This concept of equality before God between Israel and her powerful neighbours is completely lost in the rendering of TJ: "Blessed be My people whom I brought forth from Egypt; because they had sinned before Me 1 exiled them to Assyria, and now that they have repented they are called My people and inheritance Israel". It is noteworthy that no attempt is made to deny that Israel had sinned — this was after all the only theologically acceptable explanation for Israel's suffering — but the prophetic concept of universalism is deliberately reinterpreted to be the opposite of what Isaiah had intended to convey. In the same vein, Isaiah's threat that God would punish His enemies — "Ah, I will ease me of Mine adversaries, and avenge Me of Mine enemies" (Is. 1:24) — where the context leaves no doubt that the reference is to Israel and particularly its ruling classes, is turned by TJ into a message of consolation for Jerusalem and punishment for Israel's enemies: "The City of Jerusalem I will comfort; but woe to the wicked when 1 shall reveal Myself to wreak judgement upon Mine enemies a nd render ven geance upon My adversaries". Let me cite one more example of the same tendency. Amos, perhaps the most universalist of Israel's Prophets, chides his people and denounces their ethnic pride. "Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me, O children of Israel, saith the Lord" (Amos 9:7). This was, of course, not very palatable to the Targumist who renders: "Are ye, O children of Israel not considered before me as beloved children?" Thus, the prophetic denigration of Israel is turned into a divine expression of love for Israel. Equally difficult to swallow was Amos' prediction that "Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel" (Amos, 5:2). This is significantly altered in TJ which renders: "Fallen, no more to rise, is the daughter of one congregation of Israel." By the judicious addition of the words "one congregation", the sting is largely removed from Amos' dire prophecy. "One Congregation" is, of course, the Northern Kingdom of Israel which did, indeed, fall, but was survived by the Southern Kingdom of</page><page sequence="3">PATRIOTIC TENDENCIES IN T.J. Judah which subsequently assumed the title of Israel. The Talmud confirms that this passage in Amos caused anguish, especially among Palestinian Rabbis, some of whom actually tried to reinterpret it, with a view to changing its unrelieved gloom into an optimistic prediction. The passage in question was, therefore, read as follows: "She is fallen, she shall not (fall) any more, arise O virgin Israel" (T.B. Ber. 4b). The authors of TJ were acutely conscious of the suffering endured by the Jews at the hands of their enemies, and the popular desire for some compensatory blessings had, therefore, to be given expression in a suitable verse. And, sure enough, we find that Joel 2:25 — "I will restore unto you the years which the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer and the cutter" — is rendered by TJ: "I will complete (or pay) unto you good years in exchange for the years in which nations and tongues, governments and kingdoms have robbed you". TJ repeatedly insists that God had never forsaken Israel, which con tinued to be His beloved people; that in due course He would have mercy on them; and that the exiled Israelites would be redeemed, strengthened and restored to their land, which would be extended beyond its ancient boundaries. In contrast, the enemies of Israel would be humbled and cursed, and vengeance would be exacted on them. Let me cite a few characteristic examples: Is. 2:6: "For thou hast rejected thy people, the house of Jacob." Taken literally, this was unacceptable both theologically and to Jewish national pride. TJ accordingly translates: "For ye have forsaken the fear of the Mighty One who redeemed you, O house of Jacob." Although this rendering involves sharp criticism of Israel, it was still preferable to any suggestion that God had forsaken the Jewish people. In the famous parable of the vineyard in Is. 5:1 ff., the first verse, "Let me sing for my beloved a love song concerning his vineyard", is interpreted by TJ: "The Prophet said, let me now give praise unto Israel which is likened to a vineyard, the seed of Abraham my beloved one, the praise of my friend concerning his vineyard. My beloved people is Israel..." Even more expressive is TJ's homiletical interpretation of Is. 28:9: "Whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast ?,י In TJ this becomes: "To whom was the Law given, and who was commanded to understand wisdom? Was it not the house of Israel who are beloved above all the nations and cherished above all the kingdoms?"</page><page sequence="4">4 MOSHE ABERBACH The same interpretation — "the house of Israel who are beloved above all the nations and cherished above all the kingdoms" — is also given by TJ on Is. 46:3, where the literal translation of MT reads: "Harken unto Me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by Me from your birth, carried from the womb1'. It is evident that the chosen people concept, which psychologically played a vital role in maintaining Jewish morale and solidarity, needed particular reinforcement at a time of major crisis when the Jewish political entity had been extinguished and religious freedom depended on the whims of ruthless Emperors and the commanders of their legions. Since it was theologically inconceivable that God, who had allowed His people to be decimated, exiled and enslaved, could possibly be in the wrong, TJ, following sound Rabbinic doctrine, attributes Israel's suffering to the sins of the people. But, by the same token, Israel is vouchsafed divine compassion once they ceased from their wrongdoing. Thus, Hosea 3:3: "And I said to her, 'you must dwell as mine for many days; you shall not play the harlot, or belong to another man; so will 1 also be to you'." TJ's homiletical interpretation reads as follows: "The Prophet said to her, 'O congregation of Israel, your sins have caused you to be exiled. For many days you have eagerly followed my worship; you shall not go astray, neither shall you worship idols; and I also will in future have mercy upon you'." TJ's homily on Is. 8:2 is particularly instructive. The literal rendering of MT reads: "And I got reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zecha riah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me". This straightforward statement becomes in TJ: "And I summoned as faithful witnesses before me the curses which I threatened to bring in the prophecy of Uriah the priest — behold they have come. So also all the consolations which I promised to bring in the prophecy of Zechariah son of Jeberechiah I shall in future bring back." This interpretation, which bears unmistakable evidence of Rabbi Akiba's influence (cf. T.B. Mak. 24b), is pure Midrash, and the Biblical text serves merely as a vehicle for a profound message of hope which made a significant contribution to the morale of the Jewish people, both in the Holy Land and in the Diaspora. Another example of the insertion of such a message of comfort and hope is Is. 6:13, where the text reads: "And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains standing when it is felled". The first part of the verse is rendered accurate ly by TJ, which then continues: "Like a terebinth and like an oak, which</page><page sequence="5">PATRIOTIC TENDENCIES IN T.J. appear to be dried up when their leaves fall though they still retain their moisture to preserve a seed from them. So the exiles of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall return to their land." It should be noted that the last sentence is not even alluded to in the Hebrew text. In contrast to the glaring weakness of contemporary Jewry, restored Israel was to be strong. TJ accordingly interprets Is. 18:2 — where the Ethiopians are described as "A nation tall and smooth, a people feared near and far, a nation mighty and conquering" — as referring not to the Ethiopians, but to Israel, "A people robbed and spoiled... a people that shall henceforth be powerful". In the same vein, II Samuel 22:28 — "Thou dost deliver a humble people, but thy eyes are upon the haughty to bring them down" — is explained by TJ: "And the people of the house of Israel who in this world are called a needy people you shall in future deliver, and by your Memra you shall humble the mighty ones who prevailed against them." The patriotic tendency of TJ is also evident in Malachi 1:5, where the Prophet predicts that "The Lord shall be great beyond the border of Israel"; in other words, the monotheistic faith of Israel would spread into other countries. This is, indeed, expressly stated in the same chapter, in verse 11: "For from the rising of the sun to its setting My Name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to My Name, and a pure offering." However, in TJ's rendering of Mal. 1:5, the theolo gical import of the verse is partly transformed into a political promise: "The glory of the Lord shall be great, and He shall extend the territory of Israel." ' :i; *b, Acquisition of territory by Israel is also implied in TJ's rendering of Zechariah 9:6-7, where the literal translation of the Hebrew reads: "And a bastard (or: a mongrel people) shall dwell in Ashdod ... and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites." In TJ this becomes: "And the house of Israel shall dwell in Ashdod where they were like strangers ... and Ekron shall be filled with the house of Israel like Jerusalem." It may well be that these interpretations originated during the later Hasmonean age when territorial expansion was actively pursued by a dynasty whose religious ideals had been abandoned for political ambition. In practical terms, the restoration of Israel could be achieved only if the Roman Empire collapsed and Israel's hostile neighbours were punished for their cruelties to the Jews. The number of TJ passages expressing hostility to Rome — often transparently disguised as Edom or Babylon — as well as toward other enemies of Israel is so large that only the most significant can be cited here. Thus, Is. 34:9 — "And her streams (referring</page><page sequence="6">6 MOSHE ABERBACH to Edom) shall be turned into pitch, and her soil into brimstone" — is rendered by TJ: "And the rivers of Rome shall be turned into pitch, etc.". Is. 54:1 — "For the children of the desolate one shall be more that the children of her that is married" — becomes in TJ's translation: "For the children of Jerusalem that is desolate shall be more than the children of Rome that is inhabited". Is. 21:9 — "Fallen, fallen is Babylon5' (a verse cited in Revelation 14:8 and 18 2־, where Babylon is synonymous with Rome) — is rendered by TJ: "Babylon is fallen; and she shall also fall in future". Here, too, the reference to Rome is unmistakable. Highly significant as well are the TJ renderings of the headings of prophecies concerning Babylon, Moab, Damascus, Egypt and Dumah (an Arabian tribe), to be found, respectively, in Is. 13:1; 15:1; 17:1; 19:1 and 21:11. In each case TJ interprets the Hebrew Massa (lit., burden, i.e., oracle or prophecy) as "The oracle of the cup of cursing to be given to so-and-so to drink". Clearly the wish was father to the unsympathetic rendering. Even when the Prophet explains his profound sympathy for Moab, as in Is. 15:5 ("My heart cries out for Moab"), and again in Is. 16:9 ("Therefore, I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I drench you with my tears, oh Heshbon and Elaleh"); and finally, in Is. 16:11 ("Therefore my soul moans like a lyre for Moab and my heart for Kir-Heres") — even in these verses TJ, no doubt identifying Moab with the Nabatean Arabs who committed many atrocities when they served the Romans as auxiliaries in the Roman Jewish War of 66-70 C.E. (cf. Josephus, Bell. V, 13, 4-5, par. 551, 556fT.)y delib: ately avoids the prophetic expressions of sympathy, making the Moabites themselves rather than the Prophet cry and moan in anguish. Finally, there are numerous passages interpreted by TJ in an eschato logical sense. Where, for example, the Prophet may speak about contem porary nations such as the Assyrians, TJ applies the predictions to the nations of the world in general. For instance, in Is. 10:27 — "And his yoke shall be destroyed from your neck", (the reference being to Assyria) — TJ renders, "And the nations shall be broken before the Messiah". Nowhere is this tendency illustrated better than in Isaiah chapter 53 where the Suffering Servant becomes a powerful Messiah who delivers Israel from her enemies and raises her to unprecedented glory. The concept of vicarious suffering, which is by and large alien to Rabbinic thought and is rarely encountered even in Biblical literature, is completely ignored by TJ. What the congregations in the synagogues wanted to hear was not messages of evil and pain, but predictions of hope and glory. TJ provided these in ample measure.</page></plain_text>
