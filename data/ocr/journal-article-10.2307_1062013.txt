<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mircea Eliade SOUTH AMERICAN HIGH GODS PART II Although in it there are numerous lacunae, the ethnology of South America provides a rich body of materials for the historian of religions-so much so that he almost feels it to be a privileged area of study for him. There is an enormous corpus of documented material. It is at times distressingly uneven, but it does have the merit of having been collected now for almost four centuries. (As a matter of fact, Alfred Metraux, a few years before his tragic death, was considering a projected history of South American religion which would have been based exclusively upon the writings of missionaries and travelers.)1 Another distinctive feature of South American ethnology is that, although acculturation is rapidly transforming and disfiguring what is left of traditional societies, the possibility of recovering, in its integrity, a tribal religious system is not to be precluded. Completely unexpected, for instance, was Reichel-Dolmatoff's discovery of the Desana's theology, a model and justification of the tribe's religion and social structure (see below, pp. 261 ff.). But for the historian of religions, the importance of South America lies especially in the richness and complexity of its This is the second of a series of articles on South American religions based on a course given in 1964. I have added the footnotes and some bibliographical in- formation. I am grateful to my assistant, Mr. William R. La Fleur, for his care in correcting and stylistically improving the text. 1 Personal communication, June 1962. 234</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions religious creations. It must remain for the time being an open question to what degree this very richness and complexity of religious creations are the result of the intricate and still obscure cultural history of South America. In fact, there is reason to doubt the possibility of our ever being able precisely to reconstruct the history of the South American cultures. The confidence exemplified, for instance, by Wilhelm Schmidt in 1912 when he thought he could describe the Kulturkreise and Kulturschichten 2 of South America simply no longer exists. Schmidt's own enthusias- tic, but also rigid and premature, synthesis was already obsolete in the year of its publication.3 But actually, this type of knowledge is not necessary in order to understand the South American religious creations and to judge their originality. Naturally, it is always valuable and useful to know the socioeconomic stage and the cultural condition of the tribe whose religion is being considered and studied. A hunting or a food-collecting society will, for instance, have a tendency to conserve archaic elements which in a planting society would have been either lost or drastically transformed. On the continent of South America, some of the most ancient hunting and food- collecting cultures seem to have survived right up until the beginning of the eighteenth century-in spite of influences reaching them from agriculturalists and, in some cases, encounters with the early Christian propaganda. But this situation was greatly altered in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Al- though a number of tribes are still classified by ethnologists as hunters and as food-collectors,4 some of them have been in contact 2 See Wilhelm Schmidt, "Kulturkreise und Kulturschichten in Siidamerika," Zeitschrift fir Ethnologie 45 (1913): 1014-1130. 3 See Jose Vicente Cesar, "W. Schmidt e a etnologia Sul-Amerioana," in Anthropica, Studia Instituti Anthropos, vol. 21 (St. Augustin bei Bonn, 1968), pp. 40-65, esp. pp. 53 ff. Even a faithful disciple such as W. Koppers did not hesi- tate to criticize Schmidt's theory of South American culture cycles; see "Eine Wiirdigung des wissenschaftlichen Lebenswerkes von Professor Pater Schmidt und seine Bedeutung fur die Amerikanistik," Anais do XXXI Congresso Inter- nacional de Americanistas (Sao Paulo, 1955), 2:1129-51, esp. 1136. On the other hand, Schmidt's linguistic contributions are extremely valuable, and the chapter which discusses the languages of South America in his work Die Sprachfamilien und Sprachenkreise der Erde (Heidelberg, 1926), pp. 209-67 is still useful; see Herbert Baldus, Bibliografia critica da etnologia Brasileira (Sao Paulo, 1954), p. 649; cf. also C6sar, pp. 42 ff. A younger member of the "Vienna School," Josef Haekel, attempted to apply a corrected version of the Kulturschichten concept on the basis of the six volumes of the Handbook of South American Indians (Washington, D.C., 1946-50); see J. Haekel, "Neue Beitrage zur Kulturschichtung Brasiliens," Anthropos 47 (1952):963-91; 48 (1953):105-57. But see the criticism by H.

Murdock, "The Current Status of the World's Hunting and 235</page><page sequence="3">South American High Gods, II with planter cultures.5 In addition, the possibility must be enter- tained that a number of the hunting tribes in the tropical forest zone actually represent "the wreckage of evolved agricultural societies forced into an environment unsuitable to the basic economic pattern." 6 It must also be remembered that some of the agricultural societies and even some of the hunting and collecting tribes have either directly or indirectly come under the impact of Andean urban civilization. Paradoxically, this composite, syncretistic, and in some cases even hybrid and decadent social, economic, and cultural situation provides an ideal field for historicoreligious investigations, first and foremost because of the variety and richness of the religious morphology, but more particularly because it provides us with exceptional examples (some of which were until recently un- suspected by scholars) of what might be called the dialectical possibilities of religious forms-that is, the limits to which a specific religious form, when in the process of change, meta- morphosis, combination with other elements, camouflage, or decay, can go before being completely distorted or annihilated. Such processes can be witnessed in the case of all South American religious figures, but we find them nowhere more intensely active and productive of more diversified results than in the case of the "High Gods," a fact whose significance will appear more clearly at the end of the present investigation.

Perhaps the most striking example is that of the Guyaki, an Amazonian hunting-collecting tribe recently investigated by Pierre Clastes; see "Ethnographie des indiens Guayaki," Journal de la Societe des Americanistes 57 (1968): 9-61. Although they are "peut-etre la seule tribu indienne totalement depourvue d'agriculture" (p. 50), the Guyaki relish the products of agriculture, and from time to time they plunder the plantations of the Paraguayan farmers in order to snatch maize and manioc (p. 51). A seventeenth-century source, however, presents the Guyaki as maize cultivators (p. 59). Simply stated, this tribe is one which abandoned the planters' techniques and way of life and regressed to a more archaic stage of culture. As we shall see, hunting constitutes a sort of ideal and paradigmatic model for many South American societies. The religious meaning of such real or half-imagined regressions to a hunting economy will become clearer at the end of this article. 6 Donald W.

No one has ever seen his face, although a tradition exists that there were people in a former age who encountered him directly. Described as a giant with white hair, his face is said to be covered with red hair up to the eyes.8 His disposition is an amiable one, and the shamans pray to him in cases of illness and other types of distress. His anger is also, however, shown from time to time. He does this through thunder- storms, and on such occasions the Botocudo implore him with the words, "Do not be angry, Maret Khmaknian (Old maret)!" 9 The other celestial spirits serve as intermediaries between this High God and the shamans, and they, moreover, escort the souls of the dead to heaven.10 In a number of the Ge tribes-such as the Canella, the Apinaye, the Sherente-the sun is elevated to the rank of a High God, and we will, consequently, discuss these divinities later in the context of other South American solar deities (see pp. 258 ff.). Among the Amazonian population of the Tupi-Guarani group, the figure of the Supreme Being seems to have undergone many and various modifications. Traces of a cult in honor of a creator "Great Father," Tamoi, are to be found among the Tupinamba. The cult has a strong eschatological orientation. During an eclipse, the Tupinamba, appealing to Tamoi in prayers and lamentations, implore him to refrain from destroying the world. After the Portuguese conquest, this eschatological element was greatly intensified and manifested itself through a centuries-long series of millenaristic movements. The Tupinamba began a search for the mythical land of Tamoi, a sort of paradise whose inhabitants know neither death nor old age. There are similar millenaristic move- 7 Curt Nimuendaju, "Social Organization and Beliefs of the Botocudo of Eastern Brazil," Southwestern Journal of Anthropology 2 (1946):93-115, esp. 105 ff.; see J.

One of these, the Apapocuva-Guarani, has a myth according to which Nan- deruvu9u ("Our Great Father") some time ago withdrew into a distant country, a region which is eternally dark except for the light which emanates from the chest of the god. It is anticipated that Nanderuvugu will someday destroy the world, and it was for this very reason that the Apapocuva-Guarani initiated a quest for the "land without evil," the place where sandecy ("Our Mother"), the wife of Nanderuvu9u, lives.ll The messianic migrations of the Tupi-Guarani represent one of the most interesting episodes in the religious life of the South American aborigines, and we will discuss them in another context. For the present, it needs only to be added that Nanderuvugu is totally indifferent to the fate of mankind. There is, furthermore, no proof of the existence of a cult centered around him. If it were not for the fact that he is expected to destroy the world at some time in the future, he could be considered a deus otiosus. Greater actuality and "presence" are retained by the Supreme Being of the Mbya, another Guarani tribe; he gives life to the world and is prayed to for success in hunting and for health.12 The myth of the cosmic catastrophe is well known in South America,13 but it does not in every instance elicit millenaristic movements of the Tupi-Guarani type. For example, the Mun- durucu, a Tupi tribe from the interior of Brazil and representative of a more archaic cultural level than the Tupinamba, possess both the myth of the world's end and the belief in a syncretistic Super- natural Being called Karusakaibe, but, nevertheless, they have no messianic movement. The figure of Karusakaibe is an extremely complex one; originally, it seems, he was a High God with strong trickster traits and became, in time, a Culture Hero.14 Albert 11 Metraux, "The Tupinamba," in Handbook, vol. 3, esp. pp. 131 ff.; see Hand- book, pp. 89 ff., concerning the Guarani; Jean Vellard, Une civilisation du miel (Paris, 1939), pp. 168 ff.; Zerries, in Les religions amerindiennes, pp. 343 ff. 12 Vellard, p. 170. 13 See P.

A number of the Karusakaibe's myths are translated into Italian by R. Pettazzoni in his Miti e leggende (Turin, 1959), 4:375-89. In his valuable monograph, Mundurucu Religion (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1958), Robert F. Murphy considers Karusakaibe to be simply a Culture Hero (pp. 12-13), but Martin Gusinde (Anthropos 55 [1960]: 304) 238</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions Kruse describes Karusakaibe as both a creator and a civilizing god. He at one time came to earth and created the souls of men, the sky and its stars, the plants and the animals, together with their tutelary spirits. To the Mundurucu he taught the arts of hunting and agriculture, and he gave them the dualistic organization of their society. Although he is regarded as omniscient, he is not thought to be the originator of the whole of the Mundurucu culture. His children are not the result of sexual intercourse with his wife, for he has never approached her. Instead, he impregnated her from a distance by his word, and so she bore a son. A second son was carved by Karusakaibe from a piece of wood. These are all features which characterize not a High God but, rather, a demi- urge or a Culture Hero. Karusakaibe, it should be noted, is also considered to be immortal. Disappointed by the ingratitude of men, he has retired to a region which has mist but no sky. Other traditions claim that he has become the sun. He continues to watch over the Mundurucui, his children, caring for their well-being and punishing their transgressions of his laws. Before hunting and fishing and in case of illness, the Mundurucu address prayers to Karusakaibe. But eventually he will destroy the world and incinerate mankind.15 As is well known, the end of the world is not always and neces- sarily brought about by the sins and disobedience of men. Some- times annihilation becomes inevitable simply in order to renew, that is, to re-create the cosmos. The fact that in many cases the very same deity who is regarded as the universe's originator is also thought to be the one who will someday destroy it is an indication that such a High Being, although aloof, is not a deus otiosus. PURi AND ITS COGNATES According to Zerries, the Cariban people from the interior of the Guianas exceed even the Tupi people in evidencing a tendency toward "monotheism" or henotheism.16 Recent investigations by A. Kruse and J. Haekel have brought some light into an extremely confused and intricate matter. Haekel surmises that among the populations of Brazilian Guiana and the Orinoco River, the names Pura, Pore, and Puruf denote a transcendental principle. Originally, these terms expressed the notions of "power," "sacredness," and and Zerries (in Les religions amerindiennes, p. 345) have convincingly shown Karusakaibe's original and more archaic status as a Supreme Being. 15 See D. Horton, "The Mundurucu," in Handbook, 3:271-82. 16 Zerries, in Les religions amerindiennes, p. 346. 239</page><page sequence="7">South American High Gods, II "universe," but later came to be employed as direct appellations for the High God.l7 That is, the earliest thing suggested by the term "Pura" and its cognates was not so much a specific name of a Supreme Being as a general term signifying what was sacred or powerful.18 Haekel, after comparing all the data available to him in 1958, concluded that the original Cariban conception of the High God could be analyzed in the following way: The High God was without a name and was connected with celestial or cosmic light. He had a companion who was also his servant, but this companion is not to be regarded as a Culture Hero. The High God went to heaven but came back to specific places on earth in order to bring men into being and to enter into communication with them. Although there are only a few allusions to the creation of the world, there are multiple myths telling of how man was made from matter. There seems to be a general celestial orientation of "Pura religion"; the spirits reside in heaven, and it is to a celestial paradise that the dead go. The myths reveal that the High God renews himself by shedding his skin and that he offered the potentiality for doing the same to mankind but that men, for various reasons, did not take advantage of the offer and do not have the capacity to remain immortal. Haekel remarks, further- more, that among the Califia Carib group from Surinam, the dualism implied in the paired term "God and his servant" is something that corresponds to the divine demiurgic twins who are associated with cosmic polarities. Among the Cachuyana, the High God has been substantially modified by the assimilation of elements of a Moon God. This summarizes Haekel's reconstruction of what he feels might have been the original religious ideas of the populations situated between the Amazon and the Orinoco rivers. It is, of course, a hypothetical reconstruction and, as we shall shortly see, is open to criticism. As a preliminary orientation to the problem, however, Haekel's summary is useful. The problem arises when we turn to the particular tribes and look at them one by one. Among the Arikena, for example, Pura means "God." Pura and his servant Mura are imagined as small and good-looking men with red skin and white beards. They have neither parents, nor siblings, nor mates. They are, in addition, immortal and do not even become 17 See A. Kruse, "Pura, das h6chste Wesen der Arikena," Anthropos 50 (1955): 404-16; J. Haekel, "Pura und Hochgott," Archivfuir Volkerkunde 13 (1959): 25- 50, esp. 48 ff. 18 Hlaekel, "Pura und Hochgott," p. 35. 240</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions aged because of their capacity to shed their skins like spiders. They stand on the zenith of the celestial mountain in order to be able to observe everything from that vantage point. But Pura alone is the master. He and Mura both appeared in the time of beginnings along with the water, the sky, and the earth. No one knows how the sky and earth came into being, but it is known that the sky is composed of mist and is inhabited by small men and women who are the servants of Pura and also producers of thunder and lightning. There are holes in the sky, and these have different animals in them-that is, the constellations. In the mythical times Pura and his servant came down to earth and Pura built a cabin for himself in the very region which is today inhabited by the Arikena. He also carved out of wood and later animated a couple of human figures. Upon these human beings Pura desired to confer immortality and required that they enter a jar full of a hot liquid and slough off their skins inside the jar. But mankind did not pay attention to Pura's instructions and, as a consequence, is mortal. The moral and social laws of the human community were given to men by Pura in song. One day he addressed them and said, "My children, your father will now go to heaven, but you are to remain here." Some time later Marmarinu, a man-eating snake, took and swallowed all the human beings but one, who fled to Pura. Then Pura and his servant went out to meet the serpent but were themselves swallowed by it during the en- counter. Eventually, however, they were able to cut open the monster's belly and managed to escape. Pura then carved a new set of human beings out of wood and climbed back to heaven once again. But his troubles did not cease, because as men multiplied on earth they disregarded and contravened their god, and Pura eventually destroyed the world with a fire and a deluge. Only a few men survived this destruction and did so by climbing onto the back of a giant roe deer. Pura, however, will burn the world again because of man's wickedness.19 This expectation of a second cosmic cataclysm is reminiscent of the eschatological terror of the Tupinamba and of the Apapocuva-Guarani. A somewhat different picture of the High God is provided by Protasius Frikel in his study of the Arikena (Warikyana) of the Brazilian Guiana. The Warikyana see the High God in the figure of the Primordial Sun. His name is sometimes Pura, but the word 19 Ibid., pp. 26-27, based on Kruse's article ("Pur .. .") and on that of G. Polykrates, "Ein Besuch bei den Indianern am Rio Trombetas," Ethnos 22 (1957): 128-47. 241</page><page sequence="9">South American High Gods, II "Pura" is also used to refer to the world, magico-religious forces, primordial man, and the Culture Hero. Pura lives in heaven and has authority over the three cosmic elements. Mura, his servant and companion, presents certain lunar elements and also some of the features of a trickster. Pura and Mura together made human beings from hunting bows. Pura is described by other informants as the world itself when it is suffused by the light from the Pri- mordial Sun. The soul after death goes to heaven, there becomes a member of a particular celestial clan, and then eventually comes back to earth to be reincarnated here. The Warikyana express it in these words: "We die for the other world." This entire cycle of deaths and resurrections seems to have the eternal revolution of the sun as its model.20 Outside of Arikena populations (the Warikyana, the Kachu- yana), Pura as the name of a High God does not seem to occur among other Cariban tribes. But among some rather distant and culturally different ethnic communities, there are cases of names similar to Pura. For instance there is Puru of the Saliva, an agricultural tribe situated in southern and eastern Colombia. The research of H. von Walde-Waldegg in 1932-33 disclosed that Puru is a High God, invisible, uncreated, and in existence before the world was. Purui, who is most adequately conceived of as somewhat like the air, is a creative force from which all natural powers and objects come into being. He rules over mankind and, depending upon the conduct of men, gives them either good fortune or ill. A set of natural phenomena of extraordinary energy-such as wind or fire-are thought of as emanations of Puru. At the beginning, that is, in mythical times, Puru made the rain to fall and in this way fertilized the earth. When he wishes to punish mankind, he unleashes the elements with all their power to destroy. The world has already once been completely destroyed by Puru through a deluge.21 Haekel attempted to enlarge even more than that noted above the territory in which "Pura" and its cognate words occurred as key religious terms.22 He pointed out that the Surara and the Pakidai, two seminomadic tribes from the Rio Araca and the Rio Demini areas, venerate an impersonal power which is called 20 Protasius Frikel, "Zur linguistisch-ethnologischen Gliederung der Indianer- stamme von Nord-Para (Brasilien) und den anliegenden Gebieten," Anthropos 52 (1957): 509-63, esp. 516 ff.; Haekel, "Pura und Hochgott," p. 29. 21 H. von Walde-Waldegg, "Notes on the Indians of the Llanos of Casanare and San Martin," Primitive Man 9 (1936): 38-45; Haekel, "Pura und Hochgott," pp. 44-45. 22 Haekel, "Purd und Hochgott," pp. 39 ff. 242</page><page sequence="10">History of Religions Pore.23 The Surara and the Pakidai are culturally related to the Waica of Venezuela, a tribe which has a Supernatural Being called Omaua or Omayali (the latter term seemingly the hypostasis of the former), a deity who created the earth and the majority of all living beings and remained for a while with the Waica, but then produced a deluge and retired into the heavens. There is a special relationship between Omaua and the Waica shamans.24 Wilbert considers Omao of the Sanema to be a High God, and Becher compares Omaua of the Waica with Pore, the High God of the Surara and the Pakid&amp;i.25 Zerries, however, has demonstrated that the Waica actually borrowed the name and probably also some of the functions of the deity Omaua from their Cariban or Aruac neighbors.26 Haekel accepts Zerries's argument; neverthe- less, he argues that even before the Cariban influences upon them, the Waica were probably familiar with a High God comparable to the one of the Surara and the Pakidai.27 A SEMANTIC PUZZLE Haekel's hypothesis is not void of plausibility, but Zerries has recently advanced certain arguments against it. He calls attention, for instance, to the fact that among the Waica the term bole designates the spirits of the dead but can also refer to the dog or the jaguar28-probably because in South America the jaguar is 23 Ibid., p. 40; Haekel bases his conclusions on H.

Haekel's presentation and discussion of Omaua ("Pura und Hochgott," pp. 42 ff.) is based mainly on some earlier articles of Zerries; see "Schopfung und Urzeit im Denken der Waika-Indianer des oberen Orinoco," in Proceedings, 32nd International Congress of Americanists, 1956 (Copenhagen, 1958), pp. 280-88, "Die Vorstellungen der Waika-Indianer des oberen Orinoco fiber die menschliche Seele," in Proceedings, pp. 106 ff., and "Some Aspects of Waica Culture," Anais do XXXI Congresso International de Americanistas (Sao Paulo, 1955), 1:73-88.

Moreover, among the Araraibo there exists the belief in a bush spirit called Pore who roams about in the forest in the form of an ape and warns the various types of game when the hunter approaches.29 It might be added that the Surara and the Pakidai have a myth according to which the banana is a gift of an invisible spirit named Pore. Becher informs us that Pore can also be understood as an impersonal power, but then, even if not identical, it is still very similar to the definitely personalized spirits of the dead among the Waica. The banana, furthermore, is related to the spirits of the dead and plays a role in funeral rituals.30 On the basis of the facts that Zerries brings together, he argues for the existence of a religious complex centering around the terms bole and Pore that includes the following elements: spirits of the dead (Waica and Guahibo), Master of Animals (the Araraibo), and an invisible spirit which bestows gifts (such as the banana in the myth of the Surara and the Pakidai), which has a certain related- ness to the moon but which is equally conceived of as an impersonal power. There appears to be a specific structural coherence among the moon, death, Lord of the Animals, alimentation, and fertility. Zerries is impressed by the fact that the whole semantic family which includes the cognates bole, borero, Pore, and other terms is one which stresses the sacred powers in the bush and of the dead; this makes it impossible for Zerries to accept Haekel's hypothesis that the Waica, the Shiriana, and other related tribes know a High God which corresponds to the Cariban Pura.31 It is not necessary for us to enter into this linguistic and historicocultural controversy. It suffices simply to point out that, if Haekel's understanding of the term "Pore" is correct (that is, that it originally expressed notions of power, sacredness, and the universe, but came in time to be the appellation for the High God), then the fact that this central religious complex undergoes differing valorizations does not make for great difficulty.

It really need not surprise us that the very same semantic complex-that is, Pura, Pore, bole, and so forth-could be used in some cases to refer to an impersonal sacred power, in other cases to a creative High God, and in still other instances to the equally important themes of death, the game, and fertility. The very dialectic of the sacred tends to promote any religious form to an exalted and supreme position. This, of course, does not imply that there was an evolution of the Cariban High God such as Pura out of some prior religious matrix somehow analogous to the funerary bole of the Waica, for instance. It is difficult to imagine an evolution of "cosmogonic" or "supreme" deities out of spirits of the dead or out of Masters of Animals; the latter themselves imply and presuppose the existence of a world and of those initial modifications of that world tanta- mount to the beginnings of the "sacred history" (the appearance, for instance, of death). Much more plausible would be a situation in which the Waica and some tribes related to them developed their own specific funerary valorization of the sacred power Pura while the Cariban populations used the very same term as the preeminent name of the High God. THE FATE OF SOME SUPERNATURAL BEINGS In the view of the Tamanak, another Cariban tribe from Guiana, the earth was created by the Supernatural Being Amalivaca and his brother Votchi. Before his departure from earth into heaven, Amalivaca, desiring to confer the gift of immortality upon man- kind, declared that he was about to shed his own skin and that men ought to imitate him in this in order to become young again. But one woman's incredulity about this irritated Amalivaca, and he proclaimed that she would die, thus introducing death into the world.32 This myth resembles a certain episode concerning Pura (see p. 241). One can, moreover, recognize in Amalivaca a male version of Amana, the goddess of the Califia (see below, pp. 253-54). Also detectable are certain resemblances to Guanari, a divinity of 32 Cf.

Maleiwa brought mankind into being by drawing men out of the earth; these were the first Goajiro. This particular mythic theme is popular in the northern areas of South America and also among certain North American tribes. Maleiwa, in the belief of the Goajiro, civilized them and eventually saved them from the deluge by raising up a mountain on which men could take refuge. Even today it is Maleiwa who sends the rain and gives all the good things which the Goajiro expect from life.36 The Warrau of the Orinoco Delta worship a celestial High God named Kanobo ("Great Father"), who is at times represented by anthropomorphic statuettes made of wood, stone, or clay. It should be noted that, although the Warrau have conserved remnants of an old stage of culture, they were also strongly influenced by the Andean civilizations. This may account for the fact that their image of Kanobo is kept in a cultic building for that purpose, a place where very often a priest also makes his home. All of this indicates that the Warrau are a people on a level of culture quite different from the majority of tribes studied in 33 Zerries, in Les religions amerindiennes, p. 352; J. M. Cruxent, "Guanari, dios bueno Maquiritare," Boletin indigenista (Caracas) 1 (1953): 325-28. 34 According to Wilhelm Saake, Inapirikuri, the first human being, of the Baniwa (an Arawak tribe on the Rio Negro) was made entirely of bones-that is, was immortal. He was omniscient, did not have a wife, and made his companion out of clay. He then drew human beings out of a hole in the earth and bestowed on them their social institutions: see Saake, "Aus der tJberlieferung der Baniwa," Staden-Jahrbuch (Sao Paulo, 1958), 6:83-91, and "Die Juruparilegende bei den Baniwa des Rio Issana," Proceedings, 32nd International Congress of Americanists, 1956 (Copenhagen, 1958), pp. 271-79. But one can see that Inapirikuri is a syn- cretistic figure; he is a Culture Hero, a mythical ancestor, and also tupdna, that is, "god"; see Zerries, in Les religions amirindiennes, p. 345. 35 M6traux, in Handbook, 3: 711; Zerries, in Les religions amerindiennes, p. 355. 36 J.

This festival takes place at the time when the rivers overflow, and there usually is a great deal of epidemic illness and death-especially among the children. During the festival, the Warrau, having erected a central pole in the middle of Kanobo's "temple," dance around this pole and pray for the safety of their children. This ritual around the central pole is held by Wilbert to be an archaic relic, in spite of the fact that the "temple" cult seems to be a rather recent influence from Andean civilization.37 When we later ex- amine some other, similar South American rituals, we will see the fuller significance of this relic retained by the Warrau. In his extensive study of the religion and mythology of the Witoto, Preuss came to the conclusion that their principal, and in many ways their only real, divinity was Moma ("Father"), a deity which Preuss identified with the moon. Moma or Noma was without parents and had come into being solely by the power of the "Word," that is, by the supernatural force inherent in certain magical formulas and in the myths. But on the other hand, Moma was himself the personification of the "Word," and it was this "Word" which he transmitted to the first human beings. It was Moma who had founded all the existent religious ceremonies, but he himself had no worship directed toward him. "Yet he was more than a theological concept, for without him the chants and cere- monies would have been without power." 38 According to Preuss, the Witoto believe that creation took place in the following way: Moma brought all that exists into being out of the "appearance" (naino) of a thing's "nonexisting substance"; that is, he made it out of the "original thing" of everything that exists. In connection with his creative role, Moma refers to himself as Naimuema or "he who is or possesses what is not present (inexplicable, illusive)." In another myth, which complements the one above, it is related that Moma drew plants and animals out of his own body. Preuss was impressed by the remarkable similarity between Moma's creative activity by the 37 Johannes Wilbert, "Rasgos culturales circuncaribes entre los Warrau y sus inferencias," Memorias de la Sociedad de ciencias naturales La Salle (Caracas) 16 (1956): 237-57, esp. 239 ff.; see Paul Kirchhoff, "The Warrau," in Handbook, 3:869-81, esp. 879-80. On the basis of Wilbert's investigations ("Die soziale und politische Organisation der Warrau," Kolner Zeitschrift fur Soziologie und Sozial- psychologie 10 [1958]: 272-91), Murdock classifies the Warrau among the hunting and gathering peoples (Man the Hunter, [n. 4 above], pp. 18-19). 38 Metraux, in Handbook, 5:562. 247</page><page sequence="15">South American High Gods, II "Word" and the prologue to Saint John's Gospel,39 but he felt that there was no reason to suspect a Christian influence. But, by con- trast, on Husiniamui, the only sky god of the Witoto, Preuss did detect some Christian influence; this deity, in spite of his being celestial and immortal, is especially concerned with headhunting and cannibalism. Moma, it should be noted, is especially present in plants, and it is he who ensures their fertility. Moma also was the first to die and is resuscitated annually in the fruits 40-all of which is related to his lunar structure. A few words will suffice concerning two other tribes of the Amazon Basin, the Tucano and the Cubeo. Their supreme deity is Hiimanihinkii, who is said to have a house in heaven where he lives with his spouse and receives the spirits of the dead. He is thought to have created the earth and the rivers but does not now intervene in the lives of men. Goldmann suspects that Humani- hinkii is a product of Christian influences.41 Koch-Griinberg, who had visited the Cubeo at the beginning of our century, presented a rather different picture. He understood Himanihinki to be a tribal ancestor who was also a powerful magician and could take on animal as well as human forms. Before ascending into heaven, he had lived in a house at the top of a mountain and, furthermore, demonstrated certain traits of a Culture Hero, such as being born miraculously as a warrior and being the one who introduced manioc.42 Thus, in spite of the presence of Christian influences, some original traits and themes can still be detected in these religious expressions. It should also be noted that, generally speaking, "Christian influences" such as these do not fully account for or explain away the High God ideas which are present; on the contrary, the fact that a higher religion successfully influenced the existent religious ideas provides an indirect illustration of a 39 Konrad Th.

We need not give great attention to the tribes of the pano linguistic family of the tropical forests and savanna; information about them is scarce, and what is available is controversial. The Conibo are said to believe in a god called Mueraya, who rules in the sky and is the protector of the shamans. According to one of Girard's informers, the shamans consider Mueraya to be a High God whom ordinary mortals cannot see. Mueraya created heaven, earth, and mankind and lives in the center of heaven and from this location sends rain to earth when requested by the shamans to do so.43 The Cachinaua, another pano-speaking tribe, speak of an "Old Father" who lives in the sky with his wife, the "Old Mother." He is a thunder god but also at the same time a mythical ancestor and a psychopomp, for he brings the souls of the dead to heaven and protects them during their journey there.44 THE CASE OF THE TACANA The more examples looked at, the more complex and intricate the morphology of the South American High Gods appears to be. And at this point, we are far from having exhausted the most im- portant sources available. Quite recently, Karin Hissink and Albert Hahn brought to light some very interesting information concerning the Tacana of Bolivia.45 This tribe has been engaged in agriculture for a long time, but its religious ideology and its cult, as Hissink noticed, are still integrally related to the spiritual universe of hunters and food-gatherers. In this case too a com- petent and intelligent investigation revealed the presence of a surprisingly rich and diverse mythical tradition. The Tacana believe that before the present earth came into being there were other worlds which were successively destroyed by flood or by fire and that, moreover, a similar fate awaits the present earth (Hissink and Hahn, pp. 37, 41 if.). The earth is thought to have come into being by itself, but there are other sources which claim that it was created by the Supreme Being, Caquiahuaca, or by the Lord of the Animals, Deavoavai. The animals, men, and 43 Rafael Girard, Indios selvcticos de la Amazonia Peruana (Mexico City, 1958), pp. 249 ff. 44 Metraux, in Handbook, 3:681; Zerries, in Les religions amerindiennes, p. 362. 45 Karin Hissink and Albert Hahn, Die Takana, vol. 1, Erzdhlungsgut (Stutt- gart, 1961).

This type of duplication of the cosmogonic myth and of the myths of origin is not without significance. Caquiahuaca is regarded as the highest among the gods, and although he is considered to be the source of all things, nothing specific is told about his cosmogonic activity. He is described as an old man with a white beard who inhabits a mountain cave which is guarded by three gigantic animals. Said to have himself come from another world, he is the Navel or the Center of the World and is, in addition, the Lord of the Mountains and the instructor of shamans, having a small black stone as his symbol. But Caquia- huaca is also a Culture Hero and, by a terrestrial woman, has had a son, Turiana, who was made by his father to be the Lord of the Northern Region and the Lord of War (Hissink and Hahn, pp. 89 ff.). A number of inferior deities, which are in the form of men or birds and are called Edutzi, are thought to be helpers of Caquiahuaca. Their habitation is either in the mountains or in other worlds, and they are, as a matter of fact, divinities or spirits of nature-such as, for instance, of Sun, Moon, and Fire. These Edutzi have existed not only before the present world came into being but even before all the worlds which were antecedent to this one. The new species of animals which came into being in the mythical age were really produced by the Edutzi. They, like Caquiahuaca, have terrestrial wives and play a role in the selection and the instruction of shamans (Hissink and Hahn, pp. 99 ff.). But the Tacana have other Supernatural Beings as well, such as the Twin Heroes and the Earth Mother, an ambiguous deity who is imagined to be an old white-haired woman who lives under- ground. Mentioned above but requiring further comment is Deavoavai, who is also known as Ehibe Deha (literally, "The Lord of the Forest"). His appearance is that of a little man with a face painted to make him resemble a jaguar; he is said, moreover, to be invulnerable (Hissink and Hahn, pp. 153 ff.). It was also mentioned above that Deavoavai is regarded as a creator of the universe and is at the same time both a Culture Hero and the Lord of the Dead. Chibute is another personage among these deities and in many ways seems to duplicate the functions and role of Deavoavai. That is, he too is Lord of the Forest and of the Animals and is, in addition, considered to be the producer of the universe as well as of men, animals, and plants. He looks like a small but strong, dark-skinned, and hirsute man. His visage too is painted 250</page><page sequence="18">History of Religions to resemble a jaguar. He hunts with a bow and two arrows and is supposed to be the son of Deavoavai's sister (Hissink and Hahn, pp. 163 ff.). Hissink writes that the Tacana claim that Deavoavai as a creator and Culture Hero is much older than Caquiahuaca and the Edutzi (Hissink and Hahn, p. 522). This does not necessarily mean that the belief in a Lord of the Animals antedated the notion of a High God, although such a chronological sequence cannot be precluded and may correspond to reality in a number of cases. But what seems to have happened in the case of the Tacana is that the god Caquiahuaca assimilated some elements from the agri- cultural and higher urban cultures,46 while at the same time Deavoavai retained the profile he had had since the archaic hunting stage of culture. Of course, it must be admitted that we do not know the original form of Caquiahuaca-that is, as he was before the impact of foreign influences. Andean influence, for instance, seems to be suggested by the fact that Caquiahuaca is referred to as the navel or center of the world. In addition, the myth that he came from another world also suggests a foreign influence. In summary, we may conjecture that Caquiahuaca's profile underwent a certain change when affected by certain "superior" religious ideas coming from outside the Tacana culture, and, therefore, the figure of the Lord of the Animals, when compared with a modified version of a High God such as Caquiahuaca seems to be, is certainly older. This type of process has to be kept in mind when any attempt is made to compare the "age" of a High God with that of a Master of Animals. Generally speaking, a Supreme Being shows a tendency to disappear from the cult and become a deus otiosus, or else, on the contrary, he assimi- lates the attributes and functions of Atmospheric and Fertility Gods, Culture Heroes, and Sovereign and Savior Deities, and by so doing he retains his supremacy while at the same time loses some of his most archaic traits. The fact that the introduction of agriculture clearly separated the old Tacana tradition from the newer one is proven by the myth of the origin of the plants. Zerries47 has demonstrated that the 46 On the influences from higher cultures and religions, see Hissink and Hahn, pp. 459 ff. (Inca), pp. 496 ff. (Christianity), and pp. 539 ff.

In a future article discussing the religious ideas of the old-planters' cultures, we will return to this important myth. For the present, it is appropriate to point out that the Tacana myth explains the origin of the wild plants alone and is silent about the cultivated ones. The cultivated plants are supposed to have been brought to earth from another world by the Edutzi, but the significant thing is that nothing is said about their origin (Hissink and Hahn, pp. 47, 395, 524 ff.). GREAT GODDESSES AND HIGH GODS The place of the High God is in some instances occupied by a Goddess. This type of supremacy of a female deity does not, as far as can be judged, bear a direct relation to specific social structures or to a characteristic mode or economic activity. But the quality of our information is not the best, and it does not permit us to determine the role of the Goddess in the religious life of the tribe in every case. Thus, for example, the Chamacoco venerate a Great Mother called Echtewuarha, who controls everything in the uni- verse, including her own husband, a Great Spirit. Because she is the mother of the clouds, the Chamacoco pray to her for rain. Metraux, however, considers the available information to be lacunary and thinks that the position of this Goddess is difficult to assess.48 However, Baldus49 in 1931 already compared Echte- wuarha to the Universal Mother of the Cagaba (Kogi) of Colombia. We will look at this in greater detail below, but it should be 48 M6traux, in Handbook, 5:563. It is significant, however, that during the important Afiaposo feast, celebrated at the end of the initiation of young men, the women hide themselves, some even pressing their faces against the ground. It is believed that if the women were ever to discover that the masks, representing the spirits, were in reality human beings, the whole tribe would perish; see M6traux, in Handbook, 1:359 ff.

They venerate a Great Goddess named Kuma, and she, according to some sources, created the world with the assistance of her two brothers, the water serpent Puana and the jaguar Itciai. But one informant claimed the following about her: "Everything sprang from Kuma, and everything that the Yaruro do was established by her." The informant added: "The other gods and culture heroes act according to her law." 51 But in the myths, Kuma is not presented as an indulgent mother; she was, in fact, opposed to peopling the earth with human beings.52 She created the first Yaruros, and they were civilized by her son but later sinned, and Kuma, because of this sin, sent a flood which destroyed the majority of mankind. Kuma rules over a western paradise to which the dead go and are reborn as children and live an eternal paradisiacal existence there-the kind of life that the Yaruro claim to have known before the arrival of white men in their land.53 The shamans, during their trances, travel to the land of Kuma and recount in detail what they see there.54 The shamans' trances take place in front of a pole around which men and women dance in separate circles. This pole represents an axis mundi which connects earth with heaven. This is not unlike the ritual pole of the Warrau (see p. 247), but it should be noted that Kuma does not live in the sky but, rather, in the western region. The sacred pole of the Yaruro seems to be the vestige of a forgotten cult of a celestial deity.55 The Calihia and the Galibi, Cariban populations from the north coast of Surinam, have an extremely interesting mythology and theology and, for this reason, deserve a more detailed analysis. Here, however, we should notice the fact that the place of the High God is occupied by a Great Goddess named Amana ("with- out a navel," that is, one who was never born). She is imagined in 50 Zerries, in Les religions amerindiennes, p. 340. 51 M6traux, in Handbook, 5:563. See Vicenzo Petrullo, The Yaruros of the Capanaparo River, Venezuela (Washington, D.C., 1939), p. 241.

We shall shortly see if the most recent information on the Cagaba justifies a joining of these two divinities. 253</page><page sequence="21">South American High Gods, II the form of a beautiful woman whose body terminates in the form of a serpent.56 She is eternal because she can unceasingly re- generate herself by sloughing off her snake skin. Amana has begotten everything and contains everything. She, moreover, can take on any form and resides in the waters of heaven and exercises power from the Pleiades. Spirit-Serpent and Serpent-Sun are other of her appellations. She gave birth to the twins Tamusi and Yolokan-tamulu, brothers who must be thought of together just as light and darkness imply one another. Tamusi is the creator of all that is good and is also the ancestor of the Califia people; he resides in the cold light of the moon and is also the Lord of Paradise. Yolokan-tamulu, by contrast, is the source of darkness and of evil but does not seem to be thought of as a Trickster figure or as an adversary.57 He is the Lord or the grandfather (tamulu) of the nature spirits (yolokan). This pair of twins seems to represent the cosmic and spiritual polarities, something which is very characteristic of South American mythologies.58 Amana and the twins seem to belong primarily to the shamanic ideology. In fact, the shamans can enter into direct contact with Amana during their trances, and at such times either they are lifted up into the sky by her or else she descends to their ritual hut during the shamanic seance.59 In contrast to Amana, the twins cannot be summoned by the entranced shamans. Yet they are symbolically represented by a stone which is in the calabash of the shaman. There are many other important aspects of the religious life of the Califia which cannot be discussed in this context. We may note in addition, however, that Tamusi, like his mother Amana, resides in the Pleiades and is in combat with the evil powers and especially with a certain astral spirit which attempts to swallow the constellation. Such a catastrophe has, in fact, happened a few times in the past, and on such occasions Tamusi recreated the world. But it is certain that the cosmic calamity will take place again sometime in the future.60 As we have seen, this type of mythical and eschatological motif is especially found among the Tupi-Guarani tribes (see p. 238). 56 de Goeje, Philosophy, Initiation and Myths of the Indians of Guiana and Adjacent Countries (Leiden, 1943), pp. 26 ff., 35 ff., 117 ff.

All are "Sons of the Mother" and are subject to her "law," which means that they come into life, die, and are reborn in an unending cycle. It was the Mother who begot the Culture Heroes of the Kogi; one of them discovered fire, another discovered how to make clothing, a third invented the dance, and others were the initiators of other aspects of culture. But some of her sons were wicked and brought about such things as diseases, the incitement of men to violence and aggression, as well as other evil things. It is because all are sons of the Mother and because every Kogi is also a son of hers that they all together constitute a single great family. Essentially, the Mother is good, caring for and protecting her children. The entire moral code of the Kogi culture is founded on rules of conduct of a son vis-a-vis his mother. The relationship of an individual Kogi to the Culture Heroes or to the "Fathers"62 is analogous to the relationship which exists among parents, brothers, cousins, and other relatives. Life and fertility are opposed by death (heisei), a powerful counterforce. Just as life and fertility are conceived of as epiphanies of the woman, so death is a man and "the masculine concept." For the Kogi, "the two concepts of good and bad, or woman and man, and of light and darkness are in perpetual combat and mutually destroy themselves daily." 63 But this too is encompassed by and belongs to Mother's "law." Thus, there are three categories of personal forces: the Mother who gives, the "Masters" who grant permission, and Death who asks. Every individual human being strives to obtain an "agreement" between himself and these three forces through personal rites which he will repeat throughout his or her life. A Kogi never separates himself from the Mother. At birth he 61 See Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Los Kogi: Una tribu de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta-Colombia (Bogota, 1951), vol. 2.

In death he enters a third intra- uterine state, that of the tomb. A fourth phase is that in which he is reborn into the world of the dead, and it is here that he can remain indefinitively united with the Mother or, with her consent, be reborn again in the ordinary world.64 The Mother is the Cosmic Female and as such is omnipresent; yet as a divine personage she is imagined as being below the world and seated on a great stone. She is a fleshy but beautiful woman, entirely nude and with long, black hair. The world itself is conceived of as an egg with nine layers inside it. The Mother is said to have nine daughters, and each of these represents a certain type of arable soil, such as a black soil, a red one, clay, sandy soil, and so forth. These various soils correspond to the layers within the cosmic egg and, moreover, symbolize a scale of values. Men live on the fifth earth-the black soil-which is the one at the center. In this world, the Mother is personified by all women and lives in and through them, but she is also personified in nature, primarily in the primordial waters, in rain, in animals, and in minerals. The earth's caves and crevices portray the Mother's orifices.65 Moreover, the cultic house into which men retire to perform their ceremonies is a representation of the Mother. Upon entering it they say, "We are in the very body of the Mother." 66 The idea of rebirth plays an important role in the life of the Kogi. Mentioned above were the four stages or modes of being that an individual undergoes during his eternal circuit "within the Mother," but the myths tell of an even more perfect and desirable time in the past when human life could be periodically regenerated. This mythic tradition tells of the time of beginnings when the priests (mama) were able to recover their youth by penetrating through a "gate" in the hill or by bathing in a sacred lagoon.67 This is a well-known and widely distributed motif, and its sym- bolism-that of death and rebirth-is evident: the mcima descen- ded in concreto into the world of the dead and returned rejuvenated. Paradoxically, the religious valorization of the masculine 64 Ibid., p. 86. 65 Ibid., pp. 86 ff.; see also Reichel-Dolmatoff, "Notas sobre el simbolismo religioso de los Indios de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta," Razon y fabula: Revista de la Universidad de los Andes, no. 1 (1967), pp. 55-72, esp. pp. 63-67, summarized in Eliade, The Quest, pp. 138 ff. 66 Reichel-Dolmatoff, Los Kogi . . ., 2:151; cf. p. 87. 67 Ibid., pp. 87-88. 256</page><page sequence="24">History of Religions principle is an ambivalent one. Hatei Se, the Father Phallus,68 is now and then mentioned next to the Universal Mother, but he is not really a divine person but, rather, a sporadic representation of the masculine concept which appears in the form of a serpent, a stick, or as some other phallic symbol. But Heisei, Death, is not occasional or sporadic; like the Mother, he is omnipresent and powerful. Heisei is present in every masculine form and symbol- snakes, arrows, and the like. Although the personification of Heisei is less elaborated than that of the Mother, he is actually felt by the Kogi to be more "real" than she; this is evidenced by the fact that Death is mentioned more frequently than the Mother in the context of everyday life. She is graciously disposed toward her children and protects them, but Heisei, it seems, is everywhere. He is in the house, in the fields, and in the wilderness as well- always near men.69 To summarize this, we can say that the masculine principle does not seem to have been able to reveal its power and creativity in the sexual sphere. Since life, creativity, and fertility were the exclusive prerogative and function of the Mother, the masculine principle seems to have become identified with negation of life. In this instance, therefore, the masculine-feminine polarity does not find a solution in a hierogamy but, instead, comes to be drastically reinterpreted and made into an irreducible opposition between Life and Death. Nevertheless, a final victory on the part of the Mother cannot be contested, because she, ultimately, has even the dead in her own body and under her own protection. The Universal Mother, therefore, as a theophany of Life, accepts and sanctifies the complementary polarities. This par- ticular theology has two consequences. First, a generalization of the dualistic symbolism is achieved so that it extends into the world, into society, and into individuals.70 Second, a basis is provided for the important concept of yuluka, a term which can be translated as "being in agreement," "being equal," or "being identified." Thus, the concept of "being in agreement" and the knowledge of how to bring the creative and the destructive energies into balance, is, for the Kogi, the guiding principle for human behavior.71 68 "Padre Pene" (ibid., p. 89). 69 Ibid., p. 91. 70 Eliade, The Quest, p. 139. 71 "The serpents are bad; nevertheless, one has to be in agreement [estan de acuerdo] with the snakes-in the sense that, identifying oneself with the malignant force symbolized by the snake, one is considered a 'brother,' as if belonging to the same family"' (Reichel-Dolmatoff, Los Kogi .. ., p. 92); my translation. 257</page><page sequence="25">South American High Gods, II The Mother has all the characteristic features of a High God; she is the source not only of the world, of life, and of men, but also of the other gods and of the heroes. It is probable that the Mother retained her exalted position in the religious life of the Kogi precisely because all the polarities and antagonisms came very soon to be valorized as so many expressions of cosmic, animal, and human life. Thus, the ultimate reality, or that which is sacred, the source of creativity, and the structure of meaning-that is, everything that is and is meaningful-derives from Life or points to its irreducible mystery. In order to find a comparable theology and symbolism, one has to recall the grandiose religions of the Mother in medieval India. Moreover, just as in India, so here, too, among the Kogi the internal coherence and the thoroughgoing systematization of the religion of the Mother are very largely the work of the priests. Indeed, the Kogi priests, or mama, are supposed to have received their knowledge directly from the Mother. They play a very important role in the religious life of the tribe, and it cannot be denied that their traditional and esoteric doctrine is extensive, profound, and articulate. SUN GODS In evaluating the importance of solar divinities in the religions of South America, Metraux wrote: "Outside of Peru, where the Sun was both the ancestor and the principal god of the Inca dynasty, the Sun and the Moon were potent deities nowhere other than in three small Ge tribes of eastern Brazil, the Apinaye, the Sherente, and the Canella. There were also traces of a solar cult among the Guarani and among their modern descendants, the Apapocuva, but its importance was slight." 72 As we will presently see, a great generalization such as this one has to be very carefully qualified. It is significant that the sun, the moon, and the other stars and constellations play an important role in all the mythologies from Tierra del Fuego to the Guianas, while only seldom do they appear as central figures in the actual religious life of the tribes involved. The sun and the astral bodies are considered to be Culture Heroes or mythical animals which have climbed into the sky and taken their present celestial forms there. This mythical theme is found equally among hunters, fishers, and farmers.73 72 Metraux, in Handbook, 5:565. 73 See Zerries, "Sternbilder als Ausdruck jagerischer Geisteshaltung in Siid- amerika," Paideuma 5 (1952): 220-35, esp. the map on p. 233. 258</page><page sequence="26">History of Religions The presence of personifications of the sun among hunting cultures may be understood as evidence of the archaism of solar divinities. Although we are ignorant of what they were precisely, certain processes seem to have modified previous situations. This can be inferred from some of the available data. Thus, M6traux points out that, among the Mataco, "Sun was a mythological figure but not a functioning deity, for no prayers were addressed to him and no ceremonies were performed in his honor." Yet shamans in ecstasy "visited" him and asked his help in the solution of their problems.74 In the case of High Gods, the absence of a cult does not constitute a disproof of their religious validity.75 The fact that among the Mataco the shamans still "visit" Sun is something that emphasizes Sun's archaic nature and, furthermore, indicates the presence of an original structure of a High God (the "Wise God"). We will understand the religious importance of such ecstatic "visits" when we later investigate the ritual climbing of sacred poles. Lowie insisted on the fact that the majority of the Ge tribes of northern and central Brazil consider Sun and Moon to be real divinities and not simply mythical figures.76 They are credited with the creation of mankind-as they are among the Canella and the Apinaye-and the Sherente refer to Sun as "Our Creator." The eastern Timbira and the Apinaye pray to Sun on behalf of their crops and also for the cure of illness. The Canella invoke their solar gods for rain, for the protection of game, and for abundance in their harvest of crops and wild fruits. But especially among the Apinaye the Sun God has a preeminent position. He is addressed as "the Father," and in praying to him a person is expected to do so far from the village, while facing the sun and without the use of routine formulas. There are also certain collective ceremonies dedicated to the Sun God and songs addressed to him. Further proof of the preeminence of his position is the fact that a solar symbolism is what basically informs the circular plan of the village with its radial paths leading to the huts. The round meat pies used by the Apinaye in rituals are also informed by sun symbolism and are, in point of fact, actually 74 M6traux, in Handbook, 5:564. 75 See, inter alia, Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion (New York, 1958), pp. 99 ff. 76 R.

While someone is hunting, it is possible for him to receive direct revelations from Sun either in dreams or in visions. Nimuendaju recorded a village chief's vision in which Father Sun appeared as "tall and light-skinned and his hair nearly descended to the ground behind him.... His eyes were exactly like two stars. He was very handsome."77 Jensen and Haekel are inclined to see a solarized High God in this Father Sun of the Apinaye.78 For the Sherente, by comparison, Sun and Moon never appear directly to the worshiper. A visionary will receive instructions but only through one of Sun's intermediaries, such as Venus, Jupiter, or one of the stars. Moon's principal delegate and representative is Mars. However, revelations such as these cannot be obtained through the performance of ritual. During the Great Fast, the major religious ceremony of the Sherente, there takes place a climbing of ritual poles in honor of Sun.79 Our understanding of the South American solar deities has been amplified by some more recent investigations. Among the Waiwai, an Amazonian tribe located on the border between British Guiana and Brazil, Sun plays a central role in the religious life of the people and is worshiped through ritual offerings and invoca- tions. The shaman communicates with the Sun God by songs and prayers. The significant thing is that he does this directly and without the assistance of attendant spirits. He addresses the Sun God as "Father." Certain myths, moreover, tell of a celestial "visit" which two shamans undertook in order to appease Sun and to cause him to shine again in a cloudless sky.80 The shamans in ecstasy can journey to heaven and to the sun, and at death the shaman's soul climbs a long wooden ladder to the sky.8l Briefly stated, Sun is an important and popular god for the entire tribe, is the focus of a rich body of ritual activities, and at the same time enjoys a special kind of rapport with the shamans. Such position and efficacy on both a cultic level (in the religious life of the entire tribe) and on the level of ecstatic experience (as among the elite or the "specialists") are evidence of a complex and powerful religious structure. The absence of any cosmogonic element as 77 Curt Nimuendaju, The Apinaye (Washington, D.C., 1939), pp. 136 ff. 78 Adolf E.

The above notes should suffice to illustrate the richness and complexity of some of the solar deities of South America. They are sometimes the creators and protectors of life and enjoy a full and energetic cult in which the entire tribe takes part; or again, they may be accessible only through intermediary deities or only to the shamans who are capable of flying to heaven in their ecstasy. There is, then, a range of possibilities for the Father Sun, a range not unlike that found among other types of High Gods. He can be the very center of the tribal religious life, or be approached only through intermediaries, or be accessible ex- clusively to the shamans. Furthermore, when such a solar god disappears from the cult and becomes a deus otiosus, he may still assist the shamans. Of course, this range and these differences may reflect (1) the typological variety among Sun Gods, or (2) a series of trans- formations and modifications which are related to a cultural history of which we are generally in ignorance, or (3) the de- ficencies in our own information because the "field workers" (travelers, missionaries, or anthropologists) either did not satis- factorily carry out their investigations of the religious life and the mythological traditions of the tribes or else arrived on the scene too late and as a consequence could detect only fragments and remnants of a now degraded and almost forgotten traditional culture. Something of an index to the proportions and consequences of an inadequate body of information is provided by a comparison of what had been until recently the whole corpus of ethnological documentation about the Desana, a small Amazonian tribe, with the wealth, precision, and coherence of the materials recently brought out by Reichel-Dolmatoff about that same tribe.83 The 82 The Waiwai know Mawaru, the creator of mankind, but he is present only in the creation myth and there are no rituals or magic connected with him (Fock, p. 25; see also pp. 38 ff. and 93 ff.). 83 G.

They disparage fishing and horticulture and emphatically claim that they are hunters and that only the hunter's life is a life that is worthy of men. This notwithstanding, products from the hunt provide no more than 25 per cent of their total alimentation, and the remainder of their diet is supplied by the activities of fishing and horticulture.84 In addition to group ceremonies related to their life cycle, the Desana (and also all the other tribes of the Vaupes-Papuri region) hold periodic reunions which are called baydri (or dabukuri in lingua geral), on which occasion the cos- mogonic myth and the myths of the origin of the tribe are recited. The Sun, in the view of the Desana, has always existed and is called page abe ("Sun Father"). "It was not," declared Reichel- Dolmatoff's informer, "a word or a thought, but a state (of being)."85 This "state of being" was one of a golden and yellow light, and from it emanated the entire creation. But once the light had accomplished this feat, Sun commenced to organize his creation, establishing the cycles of cosmic life, the norms for social institutions, and the rules for individual behavior. The Creative Sun is not really identical with the existing luminary in the sky but is, rather, the creative principle which continues to exist as such and which, although invisible, can be known through the beneficent influence which emanates from him. Having con- cluded his creative activity, Sun retired to Axpikon-dia, which is the subterranean paradisaical zone. He did, however, send as his representative that luminary which we see today in the firmament and through which he continues to exert his power by bestowing light, warmth, protection, and especially fertility. The universe is divided into three superimposed zones: the superior or celestial, the intermediate or terrestrial, and the inferior or paradisaical. The most important structure within the celestial zone is the Milky Way, which is understood to be an immense seminal flux that fertilizes the intermediate zone. In this way, the Milky Way serves as a means of communication between the celestial and the terrestrial cosmic levels, and it is designated 84 Reichel-Dolmatoff, Desana ..., p. 8. The Desana consider the hunt to be men's activity par excellence and, thus, regard themselves as "masculine," while they judge fishing to be "feminine"; a fishing tribe such as the Pira-Tapuya is thought of as feminine in character, and the Pira-Tapuya, consequently, are "providers of wives" (pp. 12-13). 85 "No era palabra o pensamiento, sino un estado" (Reichel-Dolmatoff, De- sana ..., p. 31). 262</page><page sequence="30">History of Religions as the region of ecstatic visions and halucinations. In fact, this entire area is governed by Vixo-maxse, the divine personification of the narcotic powder vixo (Piptadenia). Shamans (paye) and those who smoke the vixo ascend to the Milky Way, where the shamans ask the Vixo-maxse to serve as an intermediary between themselves and other divine figures.86 All the divine figures, among which the Master of Animals (Wai-maxse) is most popular, were created by the Father Sun in order to protect his creation.87 All these intermediaries are representatives of Sun. Ultimately, therefore, all the cosmic energies, the universal life, and all fertility are dependent upon the Father Sun.88 There is no myth concerning the origin of man. Yet we learn that Father Sun, having decided to populate the earth, enjoined a certain mythical personage named Pamuri-maxse to guide the ancestors of the Vaupes River tribes from the original and para- disaical-uterine zone to the territories they actually inhabit today. The voyage was made in a grand canoe which was also a giant serpent. The sexual symbolism implied in this is confirmed by the etymology of the name Pamuri, a word which suggests an ejacu- lating phallus-that is, Father Sun sending a new creator to populate the earth.89 Sex is the source of life, but it can also bring death, chaos, and destruction. Sun committed incest with his daughter, and she subsequently died, but Father Sun was able to resuscitate her by fumigating her with tobacco smoke.90 This crime of incest was followed by a period of chaos, a period during which beasts and demons appeared in great numbers and endangered the very life of the world. But the creator reestablished order by proclaiming the prohibition of incest; he thus made the first and most important socioethical rule.91 Ritual participation for the individual consists mainly in the ceremonial smoking of tobacco and invocations to various animals in order to obtain a specific power or excellence. Invocations to the divinities, such as Father Sun, the Lord of Animals, or any other of the Supernatural Beings, are made through the priests (kum~) 86 Ibid., pp. 32 ff. 87 See the myths of the creation of the gods, ibid., pp. 19 ff.

As a matter of fact, the shaman is a representative of Father Sun, and it is through the narcotic vixo that the shaman enters into contact with super- natural forces that Sun has created and has appointed as his delegates.94 Due to his spiritual solar light, the paye has the power to see things that are invisible and, thus, to "penetrate" into other cosmic levels. The sexual symbolism of Father Sun is obvious, moreover, in the shaman's mystical activity.95 The function of the priest (kumzu) was also instituted by Father Sun. He is not a healer, but is particularly involved with the various ethical aspects of social and family life. He participates in the communal festivals, uses the halucinatory vixo, and assists the smokers in realizing the mystical value of their ecstatic experience. But the principal function of the priest is to pronounce what are called "the canticles of God" during the great ceremony when food is distributed to all the members of the community. He has a small altar and ritual objects that are carved out of wood and represent Sun and his daughter. Even more than the shaman, the kumu' emits a great amount of inner light, and his powers are always compared to an intense light which is invisible but capable of being perceived through its results. Assisted by his "light," the kumu' is able to discover everyone's thoughts.96 Another of his functions is to perform the "name giving" ceremony for a child who has reached the age of three years. The ceremony begins with a recitation of the cosmogonic myth, is followed by the story of the coming of the ancestors in the serpentlike canoe, and ends with the rehearsal of the genealogy of the child involved. The ritual recitation of these myths is again repeated on the occasion of the initiation of boys and girls.97 92 Ibid., p. 117. 93 Ibid., pp. 131 ff. 94 Ibid., pp. 97 ff. 95 The soul of a paye "does not have power without the knowledge which is given by the Light.... He is a part of the Sun's light." Like the solar light, the light of the shaman's soul is gold-yellow, "that is to say, representing the fertiliz- ing powers of the Sun" (Reichel-Dolmatoff, Desana ..., p. 98). For a comprehen- sive analysis of "mystical light," see Eliade, Mephistopheles et l'Androgyne (Paris, 1962), pp. 17-94. 96 Reichel-Dolmatoff, Desana . . ., pp. 105 ff. 97 Ibid., pp. 109, 114-15. Cf. Eliade, Myth and Reality (New York, 1963), pp. 33 if., on the significance of such repeated recitations of the cosmogonic myth. 264</page><page sequence="32">History of Religions It seems, therefore, that for the Desana, Father Sun represents not only a creative High God but also the fons et origo of all the sacredness in the universe. The other divine figures, as well as all specialists of the sacred such as the shamans and priests, are all creations or representatives of Father Sun.98 What is par- ticularly characteristic of the Father Sun of the Desana (and this is true for all the Tucano tribes of the Vaupes area) is the very intimate connection between solar light, sacredness, creativity, and sexual symbolism. As a matter of fact, there is here no religious idea, figure, or activity which does not in one way or another bear an equally sexual signification. The reason for this hierophanic pansexualism may be looked for in the identification of solar light and solar warmth with the origin and perpetuation of cosmic and animal life. But of no less importance here is the fact that, after the creation, Father Sun retired to the inferior and paradisaical zone-a zone which was interpreted as the cosmic uterus and, therefore, as the source of universal creativity and spiritual powers. Communication with the divinity, thus, is imagined in terms of a passive sexual contact: "the penetration of the cosmic uterus in order to encounter in it that security, that nourishment, and those requisite energies which can enable one to exist outside that uterus." 99 The mythological valorization of sex and sexual activity should not conceal the magnitude of this energetically and thoroughly articulated religious system. In it, sexuality is the expression par excellence of life, fertility, well-being, continuity, and essentially of the security that derives from confidence in the sacrality of life. But, as we have seen above, the theology of the Desana is re- markably complex. The entire creation emerges from an "ultimate reality" of which the most elevated expression is Father Sun. Expressing it in other words and in the terms of contemporary philosophy, we can say that Father Sun is one with the "ground of being." His cosmic as well as his spiritual activity is a consequence of his ontological plenitude. This type of cosmogony and theogony is one which takes place by emanation and is also the exemplary model for man's own spiritual activity. Father Sun remains invisible, although the solar light is the source of life and wisdom; parallel to this and modeled upon it is the inner light of priests and 98 Of special interest is the assertion that such an important figure as the Master of Animals was created by Father Sun. 99 Reichel-Dolmatoff, Desana ..., p. 115; but one must read the entire passage. 265</page><page sequence="33">South American High Gods, II sages which cannot be seen but is capable of being perceived in and through its results. We have accented here the materials brought to light by Reichel-Dolmatoff's monograph because their quality and, consequently, their methodological significance are obvious.100 First of all, this material reveals the theoretical coherence, the richness, and the complexity of an archaic religion. But it also, by being the kind of material it is, raises many important questions vis-a-vis the material on the Desana that antedated Reichel- Dolmatoff's work and, in general, the material on other "primi- tive" tribes. The following question arises: Does such a systematic presentation of the religious life of the Desana represent an ex- ception-in the sense that the author chanced to encounter an extraordinary tribe or an exceptionally articulate informer-or does it perhaps reveal a general poverty in the corpus of South American ethnology ? We are aware of the rapid acculturation that took place in the last few decades. It is true that in a considerable number of cases the field worker simply came too late. But there are also cases where the paucity or the mediocrity of the results is the consequence of too narrow a range of interests on the part of the researcher. The excellence of Reichel-Dolmatoff's materials forces us to admit that, in general, what we have tended in the past to ignore is the quality and the grandeur of a particular "primitive" religious system. Thus, the most interesting and valuable aspects of archaic theologies escaped our investigations and are probably lost forever. 100 In a letter to Reichel-Dolmatoff, Claude Levi-Strauss stated that, after the publication of Desana, South American ethnology would not be the same. It is true that Reichel-Dolmatoff's monograph is based on the information provided by a single informant and by a very intelligent one-but this was also true in the case of Marcel Griaule's Dieu d'Eau. It is clear that Desana theology was rigorously worked out by "specialists," for the moon, declared from the very beginning to be the brother of the sun, does not play any role in the religious life or in the mythology. 266</page></plain_text>
