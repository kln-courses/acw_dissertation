The books under review provide a reminder of how many Victorians continue to serve as fruitful subjects for biography and how many eccentrics appeared during an era supposedly governed by strict canons of social conformity. Literary historians are most likely to find the first two volumes of interest. Collie's is the first biography in more than six decades of George Borrow, whose adventures as New Testament distributor on behalf of the British and Foreign Bible Society led to that early-Victorian bestseller, The Bible in Spain (1842). Borrow also wrote Lavengro (1851), a sympathetic quasi-autobiographical account of early nineteenth-century English rural life that became a schoolroom classic later in the century. Grice is the first biographer ever of Francis Kilvert, the Anglican parson whose diaries of life in rural Wiltshire and the Welsh border country during the 1870s were first published sixty years later. Hailed by critics such as V. S. Pritchett and Richard Hoggart, the diaries have remained in print since the 1930s. The source materials that survive permit Grice to provide less a polished life than a series of useful essays introducing the man, his neighbors, and his literary remains. James Fitzjames Stephen was the subject of a classic Victorian biography by his brother Leslie Stephen (1895), but his own Liberty Equality Fraternity (1873) remained out of print for nearly a century, and Colaiaco's professed purpose is to complement the earlier life with "an intellectual biography" designed to rescue from the shadows one of "the great minds of Victorian England" (p. x). He accomplishes that task in a largely topical but admirably cogent and readable manner. One of Stephen's prime claims to fame is that, professed liberal that he was (as late as 1873 he stood, unsuccessfully, for Parliament in the Liberal interest), he found himself increasingly at odds with such varied members of the Victorian liberal world as Matthew Arnold, Charles Dickens, William Ewart Gladstone, and John Stuart Mill-all of them, like Stephen, absorbed by the task of coping with the apparently onrushing democratic tide. Arnold's ideas, as advanced in Culture and Anarchy, impressed Stephen as too theoretical and Olympian and as likely to make the state too powerful. At the same time, Stephen deplored Dickens's sentimental radicalism, his persistent but fallacious assumption "that all the folly and stupidity are found in the highest places, and all the good sense, moderation, and ability in the lowest " (p. 51). He had even less sympathy for the democratic Gladstone, whom he privately denounced in the late 1870s</page><page sequence="2">352 Book Reviews as "'the mouthpiece of blind and furious passions,' the servant of 'King Mob'" (p. 192). Stephen's most systematic criticism was directed against John Stuart Mill, the chief Victorian prophet for modern civil libertarians and feminists, and it is to Liberty Equality Fraternity that Colaiaco devotes his longest chapter. Stephen had approved of Mill's Logic, but he thought On Liberty to be based on too sanguine an attitude toward human nature and human progress and flawed by fallacious reasoning and the neglect of law. Neither as historian nor as analyst, codifier, and judge did Stephen neglect the law. Whatever the view of today's historians, contemporaries saw his prime claim to constructive accomplishment as that of a latter-day Lycurgus, one of those English utilitarians who imposed on the Asian subcontinent the Anglo- Indian Codes that, in Stephen's words, enabled "a handful of unsympathetic foreigners . . . to rule justly and firmly about 200,000,000 persons, of many races, languages and creeds" (p. 103). Ben Tillett (1860-1943), controversial trade union leader and Labour M.P., was the type of product of the new democratic era that Stephen would under- standably have feared. Schneer's biography is the first of a man he dubs "one part eccentric, two parts egoist, three parts crusader" (p. 2). Brought up in poverty in Bristol, he successfully led the London dock strike of 1889 and became a prophet of the. "new unionism" of the 1890s. Later he was a founder of the I.L.P., a "good soldier of Jesus Christ" (p. 75) in Labour churches, a socialist, a syndicalist, and an eloquent militant during "the great unrest" of 1910-14. During the London transport strike of 1912, when Lord Devonport chaired the Port of London Authority, Tillett led his assembled followers in the chant, "Oh God, strike Lord Devonport dead" (p. 160). The deity failed to oblige, and within two years Tillett had turned his wrath on German militarism instead. In 1917 it was as champion of the war effort that he was elected to (and proudly took his place in) the Parliament that five years earlier he had denounced as "the rich man's Duma, the employer's Tammany, the 'Thieves' Kitchen,' and the poor man's despot" (p. 164). The fiery advocate of the general strike, who had visualized himself as a Napoleon leading a citizen's army of well-drilled trade unionists into the class war, could at other times become the champion of binding arbitration as a substitute for all strikes and the patriot for whom "War between Capital and Labour . . . would be a calamity" (p. 189). "Consistency was never his strong suit" (p. 2), concedes the author of this succinct but highly informative and readable life, obviously the product of unusually thorough research. The chief weaknesses of the book are a general lack of concern with economic history as opposed to social and a tendency to see "the British working class" not as a semantic convenience but as a quasi-anthropomorphic entity. Thus Schneer writes that during the 1890s "the British working class forged and strengthened its modern organizational forms" (p. 59), but, having decided that trade unions should not be its "sole necessary instrument" (p. 61), it "further develop[ed] its political muscle" (p. 120) during the decade that followed. He appears to assume for that class a self-evident socialist mission toward which "the seeds of Tillett's later apostasy were already perceptible" (p. 75). And yet Schneer's evidence reveals not one class but a multitude of divergent interests, purposes, and tactics. Because Tillett's eight-decade-long career encompassed so many such variations and contradictions, he is indeed a "peculiarly useful figure in British labour history to study" (p. 225).</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 353 Beatrice Webb (1858-1943) was a virtual contemporary of Ben Tillett. Like Tillett, she grew up in a large family, had scant formal education, was plagued by intermittent ill health, became much concerned with London's dockland (and its East End generally), and was a convert to socialism. When she met Tillett, to be sure, she found him "ignorant and unwise" (p. 224), and whereas, to Schneer's regret, Tillett left little evidence about his inner or family life, Beatrice Potter (as she was until 1892) began at age fifteen one of the most fascinating diaries of the Victorian era. Its pages, too, tell us far more about "the Victorian crisis of thought" that Colaiaco discems in Stephen's life than do Tillett's recorded speeches. With Herbert Spencer as informal tutor and with other eminent Victorian "intellectual aristocrats" as guests at the Potter dinner table, young Beatrice could indeed search her soul about how to find meaning in a life bereft of the consolations of orthodox Christianity and how to reconcile, in a democratic age, two divergent paths toward social progress: to rely on "the infallibility of the judgment of the great working masses" or to have well-trained investigators discover "social laws . . . by the scientific method" (p. 123). Although Beatrice Webb drew upon her diaries for My Apprenticeship (1926) and although all three million words are now available in microfiche (Cambridge, 1978), even nonspecialists will be intrigued by the sharply etched pen portraits of prominent late Victorians such as Joseph Chamberlain, with whom she fell deeply in love during the 1880s. During the later years of that decade of social reform-mindedness, she largely resolved her internal conflict between emotion and intellect by channeling her dynamic energies into social investigation. She became at once an idiosyncratic feminist and rather less the godmother of the British welfare state than a tough-minded socialist fully prepared to sacrifice the individual to the presumed communal good. The MacKenzies have selected excerpts and identified people and places with exemplary care; only when they touch upon the broader historical context (as in introducing the Irish question on p. 149) do they occasionally go wrong. They are surely right, however, to suggest that Beatrice Potter established a type of partnership with her diary that anticipated by two decades the one with Sidney Webb. Thereafter the two partnerships overlapped, and historians have every reason to welcome the prospect of further volumes of diary excerpts. WALTER L.
