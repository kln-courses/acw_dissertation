<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHU HSI'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING HARVARD UNIVERSITY If not an axiom, it is at least a reasonable presumption in the theory of knowledge that ways of knowing must vary with the nature of the objects to be known. The knowledge of colors and sounds occupies eye and ear as the knowledge of a mathematical theorem does not; knowledge of mental states, whether our own or those of others, calls for a quite different mode of attention, to which Bergson in recent years has given the name of intuition. It is a direct application of this principle that if anything like men- tality or purpose is a factor in the wider world, what we call ' scientific procedure ' would not be likely to discern it. Such a factor might also elude 'intuition,' so far as this function is occupied with observing our own minds and with ordinary social intercourse. It would not be un- reasonable to suppose that some disciplinary preparation of the organ of perception would be necessary in order to apprehend it. This is the essential consideration accounting for much of the char- acteristic tenor of the theory of knowledge in Oriental thought. The arts of knowledge must be governed by the nature of the world we live in. Given a Hindu or a Buddhist type of metaphysics, then some form of Yoga, or physical-moral propoedeutic, would be a natural prerequisite for insight. An excellent illustration of this is found in the paper on " Integration of Consciousness in Buddhism " contributed by Professor James H. Woods to the volume of " Indian Studies in Honor of Professor Charles Rock- well Lanman." The paper is based upon a passage in Dharmapala's comment on Visuddhi MaggaI in which there is proposed a theory of the higher reaches of knowledge. Preoccupied as a Buddhist must be with the fact of change, Dharmapala accepts the view that the passing events can have no substantial reality: " If we ascribe entity to them, we distort life." But, he reflects, change presupposes some unity; and what one seeks as the highest prize of Book vii, 203. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING knowledge is an insight into this unity. Now there is an ideal being, the Tathdgata Buddha, to whom this unity is evident. The Tathagata is not disturbed by transition; he understands its laws. He perceives the numerous things in the world, and recognizes their attractive qualities, but knowing also their mortality, he is not tempted to seize on any of them as his good: he is like the lotus, not disattached, not swept away by the current, and yet on the other hand not fascinated, not under illusion, unspotted by the world: he overcomes the world by compre- hending it. But of what value to the ordinary mortal is this ideal insight of an ideal being? It is this, according to Dharmapala, that the ordinary being, without reaching for himself a final fullness of insight, may dis- cern the Tathdgata, and thus be assured that the final attainment he seeks is indeed possible, because it has been reached. But how is one to discern the Tathagata? Clearly not by the senses, nor by the ordinary means of observation. A prior self-discipline is required, consciousness must be "integrated '; and to this end a rigorous self-control must run through all behavior: Without the control of conduct, no equipoised mental events. Without poise, no insight.... When one discerns the order of things, one discerns Him. When one discerns Him, one is aware of the coherence of existence. One is presumably looking for objective knowledge,-highly general knowledge, to be sure, but definitely within the realm of objective truth,- How do things ultimately cohere? In the path of this quest, we have this curious interposition of the Tathlgata, whom, it is said, we must first know. This to us cryptic proposal may be interpreted, in terms of more general categories, somewhat as follows: Things and events are not merely additive items whose sum makes up the world; science reveals them as parts of a single system, Nature. Now ' Nature' is a term of hope, rather than of scientific achievement; the final synthesis of the laws of change is never reached. Before we reach this elusive physical unity, the question recurs which in western thought we supposed we had banished,-perhaps the ultimate order of things is less an order of fact than an order of meaning or value! We appear driven to assume a teleological structure in things, as a condi- tion of completing our scientific labor. The Buddhist, never wholly succumbing to anthropomorphism, provides this teleological element by invoking a quasi-personal being as a symbol of the nature of the final coherence of things, and then develops a special branch of his theory of knowledge for the perception of this being.</page><page sequence="3">CHU HSI'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE ill In this generalized form, the doctrine of Dharmapala is typical of a widespread tendency in Oriental theory of knowledge. It appears, strongly marked, in Chu Hsi, in whom strands of Buddhist thought fuse with a vigorous re-interpretation of Confucianism. It is of peculiar interest in his case, because this remarkable thinker of the twelfth cen- tury, the most systematic of Chinese philosophers, was also closer than any other before our own century to an anticipation of what we now call 'scientific method' and tend to invoke as the whole of wisdom in the business of knowing. I. CHU HSI AS RATIONALIST AND AS EMPIRICIST Dr. Hu Shih has designated the period running roughly from 1100 to 1600 A. D. as the Rationalist Age of Chinese Philosophy, including therein both Chu ilsi and Wang Yang-ming EEMJ3. The contrast implied in the term ' rationalistic' is a contrast with the mystical ten- dency of the Buddhist schools, particularly the Ch'an 49' school, which sought for its followers a sudden, personal, ineffable enlightenment. In reaction against this esoteric obsession which had begun to appear to Chinese common sense as a meaningless mystification, the Sung Con- fucianists went boldly at the business of presenting an explicit system of the world,-a system which reason could aid in discovering as well as in expressing and defending. This does not mean, however, that to the Sung Confucianists the universe could be reasoned out without appeal to experience. And as between Chu ilsi and Wang Yang-ming, Chu ilsi might fairly be de- scribed as an empiricist. In his theory of knowledge he repeatedly insists on the necessity of much observation as a basis for any important insight into 'principles.' It was in this sense that he interpreted the demand of " The Great Learning " for the " investigation of things." He gives many evidences of being himself a keen observer of nature. HEis notes on the likeness and differences between man and the other animals are remarkable: In our sense of heat and cold, of hunger and repletion, in the love of life and shrinking from death, and in the instinctive seeking for what will benefit and shunning of what will be prejudicial,-all this is common to man with other creatures. (But) the diversity of Law is seen in the existence among ants and bees of the the relation between sovereign and minister, in which there is mani- fested no more than a gleam of Righteousness; or in the existence among wolves</page><page sequence="4">112 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING and tigers of the relation between parent and child, in which there is manifested no more than a gleam of Love. .... It is not the case that man, as the being possessed of the highest intellect, stands alone in the universe. His mind is also the mind of birds and beasts, of grass and trees. 'Man,' however, 'is born endowed with the Mean, the attribute of Heaven and Earth.' Chu Hsi quotes the last sentence from Yang Kuei-shan (1053-1135). The sagacity of the passage may be measured not alone by its easy acceptance of biological continuity underlying difference, but by its identification of the differentia of man. Biologically, as we now see, the peculiarity of man turns out to be the balance which exists among his instinctive propensities,4 a balance which fits him for hesitation and reflection, and thus for the influence of ideas upon his behavior. As the Sung philosophers expressed it, very accurately, he "is endowed with the Mean." Chu Hsi observes things not solely for the sake of collecting interesting items of information, but for the sake of discerning the 'principles' they embody. This also is wholly in accord with the spirit of empirical science. It has much in common with Bacon's interest in discovering the 'forms' of phenomena, through the collecting and tabulating of instances of like- ness and difference. Chu Hsi presents no rules for discovering the ' principles'; there is nothing in his work corresponding to the ' methods of induction' of Bacon or Mill. It is well to remember, however, that these methods are not what their name implies, since no rule for in- duction has ever been given by any logician. The various methods, so-called, are merely ways of assembling phenomena in the hope that relationships may become salient; but the perception of those relation- ships is still a work of mother-wit, for which no rules can be given. Chu Hsi simply insists that all effort to observe must be attended by thought: In the 'investigation of things' and the 'perfecting of knowledge,' even though the response to environment be natural and easy, how can there be neg- lect of thought in approaching any matter.5 In what sense, then, can Chu Hsi be regarded as a ' rationalist'?

N., 265.</page><page sequence="5">CHU HSJ'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 113 sought 'principles ' and a system of them-so does every scientist. But Chu Hsi may deserve the name rationalist in this sense, that he leaps at once to the ultimate principles. His intermediate structure of classi- fied knowledge is very sketchy. And in the 'principles' which he finds, there is reason to believe that his eyes have been guided by another than the scientific mode of vision. I need do no more than recall what some of these 'principles-' are. What he finds in every living thing is a union of the primary duality, Li f! and Ch'i A, Life-charter and Substance, neither of which can exist without the other. Ch'i (which Bruce translates Ether) is a subtle all- pervasive quasi-material entity, capable of local variation, of degrees of density and of resistance to the pure control of the spiritual principle, Li. So far, this is not a bad set of categories for scientific use, especially if we translate Li, with Bruce, as 'Law.' But Li has a pedigree which may disqualify it. It must be understood as one of four manifestations of the Ultimate Being, these four to be taken in a descending order. They are: T'ien X, Heaven; Ming f, Heaven's Decree, which is at the same time the Vocation, Bestimmung,6 of the creature; Hsing 1M, the Nature of the thing; Li A, the individualized embodiment of the Nature, i. e., the Life-charter of the individual being. T'ien and Ming can be regarded as the active, transmitting function; Hsing and Li as the receiving function. These functions are two aspects of the same continuous activity: for Heaven is always engaged in its decreeing of destiny; and things are always showing signs of an impressed Law, the Hsing or Nature of the species, contained in the Li or Life-rule of the individual. This activity and this receptiveness, taken together, constitute what we may call the life of T'ien, or the manifestation of Tao A, the Ultimate Order of the World, which for Chu Hsi is a moral order. With this pedigree, Li can hardly fail to be less a biological Life- charter (though it is this) than a moral Life-charter, an admonition of what the individual ought to become as a moral being.) It is this 6 Zenker's translation. The German term here seems peculiarly apt. 7The translation 'Law' for Li is defective, since it fails to convey the in- dividualized quality, which for Chu Hsi is characteristic. In this respect, 'Charter ' is better. Zenker's term, ' Form,' is still wider of the mark, though he defends it in a learned footnote (Geschichte der chinesischen Philosophie, ii Bd., S. 253 n). He seems to me quite right in rejecting McClatchie's translation as ' Fate,' though this, too, may carry the needed individualized connotation. But he appears to overlook the fact that the Li of Chu Hsi's cosmology is intentionally distinguished</page><page sequence="6">114 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING alteration from the factual to the ethical point of regard, in his list of 'principles' that gives them, from the scientific quarter, an a priori character; in this sense we may provisionally accept the epithet ' rational- ist' for his epistemological attitude. We shall return to this question in our third section. For the moment, let me point out further relations between Chu Hsi's theory of knowledge and the current conception of ' scientific method.' from the Li of common usage. It is quite a different character. The Li of com- mon use, which Legge translates 'propriety,' is NIO; the cosmic Li of Chu Hsi is 3A. Chu Hsi uses Li in its usual sense in his traditional list of the cardinal virtues, commonly translated Love, Righteousness, Reverence, Wisdom. The term for Love is Jen f-, more accurately translated Fraternity or Human Reciprocity; the term for Reverence is Li At, a sensitive regard for the fitness of things verging toward etiquette in social observance, or the good form which arises from perfect tact. This is clearly a quality of the subject, whereas the Li which is received through the heavenly activity is for the subject an objective reality. Zenker's effort to unite 'propriety' with the cosmic Li is thus radically mistaken: if 'Form' were to be used for Li, it would have to be in the strictly objective Aristotelian sense, and with a note of obligation which Aristotle's Form does not convey. On the evolution of the concept of Li, I may quote parts of a letter from Professor Lin Tsai-Ping, March 1932. "The Confucianists of the Han Dynasty usually explained the word 'Li' by 'Tiau li' (order, system), or 'Wen li' (streaks). For instance, Ch~ng Hsiian in his commentary on Li Chi jj614f (the Book of Rites) said 'Li' means 'F~n' or division (classification?). And HsU Shen =pW in his Shuo WTV Ety- mological Study of the Chinese Language) said 'The original signification of Li means to work on jade.' Tuan YU-tsai in his commentary on Shuo WTn said 'Li means to divide and analyze.' Chang Hsing-fu in a book called Shuo WTn Fa I said 'Originally Li means to work on jade' and the words 'Shun' (obedient) and 'Shih' (right) are both defined by the word 'Li.' So we can see that 'Li' means order or system. " Then in the Book of Rites, in the chapter on Music there is a sentence which reads like this: "'Wlhen Li is externally manifest (in the conduct of the ruler), the people never fail to accept and follow him' (Li Chi, p. 63, 1. 10). "Ch~ng Hsiian in his commentary explained the above in this way: 'Li here means that which regulates conduct.' In these words we can see that ' Li ' here is made to mean behavior (etiquette), and in reality this import is still derived from the sense of ' order, system and streaks,' and therefore they are objective." (The word 'streaks' which occurs in Professor Lin's exposition refers to the fine lines of cleavage just faintly visible in jade, indicating its structure, and guiding the tool of the workman.) "As to the relation of 'Li' with the mind, there is a passage in Mencius, saying:</page><page sequence="7">CHU HSJ'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 115 II. CHIu HSI AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD Science, in its present guise, is both empirical and rationalist; we have come to recognize that these two contrasting directions of thought are not incompatible. And Chu Hsi, as we have seen, buzzes close to the idea of a scientific investigation. His insistence that there can be no Li without Ch'i,-or very roughly speaking no Form without Matter,- hence no 'Pure Form' in the Aristotelian sense, directs his attention always to the 'things.' It is always in rebus that ideas and principles of order have to become manifest. This is the essence of the empirical spirit. But the motivation of Chu Hsi is not the motivation of modern science. "'What do the minds of men agree in approving? They agree in approving Li and Yi (rightness) "The significance of 'Li' in ethics can be seen from the passage in the chapter on Music in Li Chi, which reads: "'There is no limit to the influence exerted on men by things. When man fails to control his likings and aversions, " things " dominate him; and he becomes as it were transmuted into a " thing." When man has become thus transfigured he has extinguished in himself the heavenly Li, and impoverished his own desires' (p. 47, 1. 6). "The Confucianists of the Sung Dynasty accepted all the three meanings of Li above mentioned.... They frequently mentioned Li and Yu (desire) side by side as antithetical. ... "The new interpretation of 'Li' introduced by them is this: They gave it a metaphysical signification, but at the same time did not regard it as a transcendental entity beyond the physical phenomenon. The various interpreta- tions given it may be classified in two categories: " (1) 'Li' means the intrinsic nature of things, or why things are what they are. For instance, Ch~ng I said, 'All that appear before our eyes are things; and everything has its "Li." This is the reason why fire is warm and water is cold. It is also "Li" that makes the particular relations between fathers and sons, kings and their subjects, what they are.' Chu Hsi said, "'There is nothing in the universe but motion and quiescence alternately following one another without interruption: this is called 'I' (change). And there must be a Li governing this motion and quiescence. This is the so-called Tai Ch'i (the Great Absolute).' " (2) 'Li' means 'what ought to be.' For instance, Lu Chiu-Yfian said, "'We are endowed with everything, and nothing is wanting; so if occasion calls for compassion we would naturally show our compassion, and when occasions require us to feel ashamed, we would naturally feel ashamed. . ..' "In conclusion I wish to point out the fact that although there are quite a number of interpretations for the idea 'Li' expounded by the Chinese philosophers, yet all of them emphasize the objectivity of 'Li.' Whether I am right in this opinion, I submit it. ..."</page><page sequence="8">116 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING Bacon-typical here of the scientific spirit,-sought principles for the sake of the control of nature. Chu Hsi was interested not at all in the mastery of nature, but rather in self-mastery and the right ordering of life. There is a strain of almost Buddhistic finesse in his persistent efforts for the precise definitions of his leading categories; but, for him, as for the Orient generally, neither science nor metaphysics is pure theory,-detached speculation; they are an integral part of the defini- tion of a right way of life. This carries with it another difference. 'Scientific knowledge' as we understand it today, has a peculiar relation to a democratic organization of society. It belongs to every man. For scientific knowledge must be verifiable; that is to say, anyone who can comply with the conditions of observation may discover its truth for himself. No peculiar genius, no esoteric insight, no aesthetic or moral preparation are demanded in order to note an eclipse or to determine the effect of carbon on the tensile strength of steel. Hence the important truths of science lend themselves to dissemination through the schools, they become popular possessions. Wherever there are new national systems of education, 'scientific knowl- edge' is playing, and should play, an increasing role. The traditional scholarship of China and India stood in strong contrast to this. Not only did it demand peculiar gifts, but in many of its higher reaches, as we have seen, it called for a special moral discipline. One who achieved it set himself apart from other men. Not that others were forbidden to follow-on the contrary, at least in China the way stood open to all-but it was recognized that the excellent things were in their nature difficult, and therefore rare. Scholarship became the mark of an aristocratic group. Now to Chu Hsi and his school belongs the signal merit of showing China a way out of this invidious contrast. Chu ilsi holds to the aristo- cratic tradition in this sense that he in no degree mitigates the difficulty of knowing the special objects with which he is concerned. Since ethical conditions are involved, they cannot be put on the scientific highroad. But he also saw that unless scientific truth is the whole truth-as it is not-it will not of itself satisfy any human mind: for no truth is sufficient for men or nations but the whole truth. The obvious utility of scientific knowledge, and its easy spread through a democratic society, would constitute no reason for displacing any sort of valid knowledge- ethical, metaphysical, aesthetic, literary, psychological-which may lie outside the scientific border.</page><page sequence="9">CHU HSJ'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 117 The issue, then, is whether this further knowledge can be made generally accessible. This Chu Hsi believes possible. The importance of this position will justify a separate and closer examination of the ethical conditions of knowing as conceived by him. III. THE ETHICAL CONDITIONS OF INSIGHT The severe strictures upon Buddhism which abound in the writing of Chu Hsi may be a measure of how much he was influenced by Buddhism. He frequently directs his shafts against those practices of meditation, or ' still sitting,' which especially characterized the Ch'an school. This school, which in Chu Hsi's time was the chief vehicle of the 'Nothingness' cult of the Prajna-paramita tradition, had transformed the notion of the Yoga. In its original form Yoga could be roughly described as an intense effort to create the conditions for perfect mental self-control, beginning with a thoroughgoing muscular control of the body. The Ch'an school made of it an art of mental self-cancellation, attempting to induce an attitude of fortunate receptivity in which a sudden uncommandable enlightenment may occur,-an enlightenment in which the emptiness at the heart of all phenomena is transparently mani- fest. The kinship between this ideal and the paradoxical Nothingness of Tao has been frequently pointed out; and the teachers of the Ch'an sect, said to have received thanks from their students for " having taught them Nothing," are not far from the Taoist picture of the sage, who " conveys by silence his instruction." llu Shih regards Ch'an Buddhism as the beginning of the Chinese conquest-both by assimilation and by reduction to emptiness-of Buddhism, the invading metaphysical monster. Chu lHsi, however, is not prepared wholly to dismiss the meaning of meditation. Consider his criticisms, and observe what remains. Its physical aspects he regards with undisguised disfavor. Still-sitting is simply incompatible with a useful life; and there is something ab- normal if not ludicrous in the bodily rigor: Consider the teachings of the Buddhists on rigid posture and hard discipline,- holding a dusting brush with the hands erect, carrying water and fuel... ." 8 The mental direction is wrong: the meditators are concentrated on themselves, they are aiming at complete self-transparency; but the true object of knowledge is the outside world: 8 BRUcE, P. H. N., 189.</page><page sequence="10">118 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING They indeed observe and contemplate the Mind, and yet with it all, we can- not in their company attain to the moral ideal of Yao and Shun, simply because, not recognizing the Divine Law, they regard Mind alone as ruler; and thus there is no security against falling into selfishness. This accords with a saying of our predecessors that the sages regard Heaven, the Buddhists regard Mind, as the foundation of things.9 In an almost Kantian turn of thought, he condemns the effort to learn of the Mind (if that were our object) by direct introspection; for this would suppose that there are two Minds, one to observe and one to be observed,-" as if the mouth were to gnaw the mouth, or the eye to gaze at itself." The certainty of a development of selfishness in this self-absorption seems to Chu lHsi clearly to defeat whatever moral purpose it may enter- tain: " The selfishness of ordinary men, and the self-concentration of the Buddhist, are one and the same selfishness." 9' But the chief difficulty is in their misconception of the object to be known. It is one thing to direct the effort of knowledge to a trans- cendant absolute, another to direct it to a self which dissolves into nothingness, still another to direct it to the 'principles' which are in the things. It is only the last which is legitimate. When meditation ends in a trance, and cannot say what it perceives, it acknowledges itself to be on a false scent. " 'By the art of Meditation to enter Tao ' means that when thought reaches the point that its stream is cut off, Divine Law is perfectly mani- fested. This again is incorrect. True thought is Divine Law; its con- tinuous flow and operation are nothing else than the manifestation of Divine Law. How can it be that we are to wait till the stream of thought is cut off before Divine Law is manifested? . . . If the Buddhist really apprehends Divine Law, why must he act contrary to and confuse, cut off, and destroy all these, beclouding his own mind, and losing his true knowledge of himself ? " 10 This is beautifully clear and emphatic: it expresses Chu Hsi's pre- dilection for the concrete, for knowing things in rebus. He can quite properly appeal to Mencius for a much directer statement of the neces- sary ethical prelude to knowledge, " Hold fast the Mind, and preserve it,"-by which Chu Hsi understands "not that we are to sit in rigid posture and preserve a manifestly useless intelligence" (or to reduce 9 Ibid. 9a BRUCE, P. H. N., 254. 10 BRUCE, P. H. N., 301 f.</page><page sequence="11">CHU HSI'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 119 intelligence to uselessness), but rather " not allowing the doings of the day to fetter and destroy the natural goodness of the virtuous nature." But these criticisms of meditation are not by any means a complete view of Chu lHsi's actual theory. For in the first place, his metaphysics is not so far from the positive aspects of the contemporary Buddhism as from the negations of the Ch'an school. He, too, had his mysterious and absolute unity, the T'ai Ch'i of his predecessors, which " is called the Infinite, because it has no relation to Space and Form. It penetrates the entire universe so that there is nothing in which it is not; yet no one hears the sound of its voice: it is invisible and not to be perceived by any of the senses."" There are at least two ways of dealing with an unnameable Absolute; one is to put oneself into an equally unnameable state of mind, plunge into the dark, and emerge speechless. The other is to acknowledge the existence of this ultimate unity, and the experience thereof, the tathata of the Buddhist, and then, since one can do no more with them, give one's attention to the plural aspects of the world. Chu Hsi prefers the latter alternative: he indicates the place for a monistic resolution of his cosmic dualism of Li and Ch'i, and then occupies himself with the plurality of second principles. Among these second principles, in some- what ambiguous relations to the rest, is Mind in general, lHsin i:, which corresponds in the universe to the Mind of the individual man. Of this Mind we see clearly only this; that it is referred to repeatedly, following the dictum of Shao Yung (1011-1077), as the enceinte (or Platonic Receptacle?) of the Nature, Hsing. Compare now with this vague conception, a few lines from the Suran- gamma Sutra, one of the earliest known in China, in which the Tathagata Buddha is represented as speaking to a great assemblage, expounding the nature of the Universe. Two things appear to them through his dis- course: first, that Each one's heart is coextensive with the universe, seeing clearly the empty character of the universe as plainly as a leaf or trifling thing in the hand. and, second, That all things in the universe are all alike merely the excellently bright and primeval heart of Bodhi, and that this Heart is universally diffused, and com- prehends all things within itself.'2 II Heinrich HACKMANN, Chinesische philosophie, 346 f. 12 S. BEAL, A Catena of Buddhist Scriptures from the Chinese, 343.</page><page sequence="12">120 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING The 'heart ' here appears as individual mind and also as cosmic mind. It would not be unjust to Chu Hsi to suggest that his conception of the cosmic role of Mind is comparable with that of the " Heart of Bodhi " in this Sutra; nor is it far away from the generalized function of the Tathdgata, as we drew it at the outset from the passage discussed by Professor Woods. Indeed, Chu Hsi, in trying to express how the One appears in the many things, makes use of the common Buddhist-Hindu simile of the moonlight on the water: As the heart of the Tathagata is not born and does not perish, it mirrors itself in all things, as the moon on the water."' With these substantial agreements in the quasi-mental nature of the cosmos, in its secondary categories, there might be expected to be rapprochement in the corresponding theory of knowledge. At first glance, this rapprochement is not marked: we find Chu Hsi falling back on pre-Buddhistic imagery in his effort to indicate a method for the knowledge of the 'principles'; he makes a great deal of the quantitative and spatial notion of " extending the mind " which he finds suggested in Mencius, and in the Doctrine of the Mean: Mencius had said: " By developing our mind to the utmost, we under- stand our own nature and know Heaven." In the Doctrine of the Mean it is said that " When the mind is enlarged it can enter into everything throughout the universe.... The mind of the man of the world rests within the narrow limits of the senses." 14 Chu Hsi so thoroughly adopts this figure as to say that " All other distinctions are lost in this distinction between greatness and littleness." 15 His notion of the mental is through- out strongly tinctured with the physical: the word 'spiritual,' which im- plies perhaps the farthest remove from the material is still, with him, a matter of ethereal fineness as of a ghostly body, rather than a matter of pure thought. Consider this passage: The Mind is most spiritual. So fine is it that it penetrates the very point of a hair, or the smallest blade of grass, and I become conscious of them. So great is it that there is not a single place from nadir to zenith, or within the four points of the compass, where it is not present. (Then with an analogous assertion of extension in time, which does not involve the physicalizing of mentality: ) Back through the countless ages of the past, or forward through the unknown periods of future time, my thought reaches to the end of them the very moment it pro- 18 Ghanavyuha 94tra, quoted by H. HACKMANN, Op. cit., 347. 14 BRUCE, P. H. N., 178. 15 Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">CHU HSI'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 121 ceeds from my Mind. It is unfathomable in its spiritual intelligence, most in- tangible, most spiritual and marvellous in its orderliness! 16 This is only to say that Chu ilsi-as is not surprising-is pre-Cartesian in his categories: he has not made the radical distinction between the mental and the non-mental. In the eyes of certain contemporary phi- losophers, who consider that Descartes did his cleavages too well, this may rank as a merit. I believe, however, that while the Cartesian dualism, like all other dualisms, has to be overcome, the cleavage can only be cured by being first clearly seen; so that the Cartesian stage has be gone through in every philosophical tradition, sooner or later. In any case, the first conception of metaphysical knowledge which we find in Chu ilsi is that of a semi-physical penetration of the object, a sort of out- ward expansion of the mental reach, very swift if not instantaneous. But Chu Hsi is not bound by the letter of his own metaphors. He had gone too far with Buddhism to be a contented naturalist in his theory of knowledge. In the 'enlargement of the mind' there is a qualitative change to be achieved: it carries with it an ethical 'enlargement,' an attainment of 'magnanimity,' of freedom from petty self-absorption or self-concern. His predecessor, Chou Tun-i, had already indicated as stages in the Knower's Progress, a series of formidable personal attain- ments,-' nobility,' ' sagehood,' ' sainthood,' heavenly character,'-which perhaps may have served as a fair exoteric substitute for the ten stages of elevation devised by esoteric Buddhism as a condition for final insight. But with his gift for finding the central things in the psychology of character, Chu Hsi was less concerned with the stages than with the essential quality running through them all. This quality is Sincerity or Truthfulness, the unselfishness of the mind. Confucius had remarked that without Sincerity, neither Righteousness nor Propriety had any grounding; and on this account we often find Sincerity appended as a fifth to the traditional scheme of four virtues. To Chu isi, however (as for Gandhi), Truthfulness is not so much another virtue as the soil in which any virtue whatever must grow, and any progress in attaining objective truth. The enemy of clear insight, he frequently designates simply as 'desire,' which is consistently opposed to 'Li': When man's mind is empty and still, it will follow naturally that it is pure and clear. When it is clouded by creaturely desire, it is sunk in the deepest darkness.... 1I BRUCE, P. H. N., 170-1.</page><page sequence="14">122 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING The Mind is essentially formless spirit; all laws are complete within it, and all phenomena come within the sphere of its knowledge. In these days, people are for the most part perverted by their physical nature, and beclouded by creaturely desire. Thus their minds are darkened, and they are unable to perfect knowledge.... The Mind is not like a horizontal door which has to be made larger by force. You must clear away the obstructions arising from creaturely desire, and then it will be pure and clear, with no limit to its knowledge. In investigating the principles of phenomena, there will be free communion.17 Sometimes the enemy is specified as the desire for gain: Though there is no one who does not possess this Mind, most men know only the desire for gain, till the Mind becomes completely submerged in it.18 But for the most part, it is designated as 'egoism,' as in the following passage, typical of many: In the passage, 'When the mind is enlarged, it can enter into everything throughout the universe,' the expression 'enter into I is like what is spoken of as 'the universal embodiment of Love in actions,' and means that the principle of the mind permeates everywhere like the blood circulates in the body. If there is a single thing into which it does not enter, its permeation is incomplete, and it fails perfectly to embrace all things, which is egoism. For selfishness pro- duces separation between the ego and the non-ego, so that they stand opposed the one to the other.19 In all this, however, Chu Hsi makes no recommendation to abandon the world, nor to uproot desire. He does not propose that the crav- ing for individuality is the root cause of all suffering and of ignorance. Selfishness has to be overcome, but not the Self. The natural state of the mind is not selfish: our nature is our 'Li,' and the cure of selfishness is the return to our original quality, which is out-turned and absorbed in the object. It is true that desires are to be feared, and to be kept under perpetual vigilance: "whether great or small there must be no careless- ness with regard to any of them." One who aspires to the highest knowl- edge will resemble the ascetic; he will "make desires few"; he may emulate saint T'ang who " did not come within the sound of lewd music, nor approach dissolute women, nor seek to accumulate property or money." 20 But the word in regard to desire on which Chu Hsi ends is the Confucian word 'Watchfulness,' not the Buddhist word 'Extinction.' Chu Hsi himself was not insensitive to the fact that in thus committing himself to the sober and continuous discipline of human nature, he lost 17BRUCE, P. H. N., 177, 166, 181. 18 BRUCE, P. H.

His philosophy draws no sharp lines and calls for no crises in the life of insight. He does go so far toward recognizing the validity of such sudden illumination as the Ch'an devotees sought and professed to find, as to see in the ' return' to the original clarity of the Mind an operation 'profound and mysterious ' and manifold in its varieties: The first thought of repentance and turning toward goodness which arises in the midst of darkness-this is a 'return.' The sudden awakening from sleep is a picture of the 'return.' Or when, the repression of the moral principle in man having reached its climax, there is a sudden clearing of the channel . . . this again is a 'return.' The principle has countless transformations, and wherever you find it, it is always profound and mysterious.21 Sudden enlightenment, then, is not excluded: but insight is more likely to arrive through the path of induction, as a late sequel of the prolonged 'investigation of things ' and of the persistent struggle against selfishness. It may not be amiss to remark that, in this point, Chu Hsi stands nearer to the spirit of original Buddhism than to that of the Buddhism of his own! environment. For the whole point of the Noble Eightfold Path is that it constitutes an ethical interlude in the quest for Nirvana. " Right Views, Right Effort, Right Livelihood " . . . these are the media in which an unselfish habit is to be built up; how far such habit has actually destroyed the root of illusion,-this is to be tested only occasionally, by " Right Meditation." The life of the early Buddhist thus naturally fell into a rhythm or alternation of out-going and introspective activities,22 an alternation whose necessity is suggested here and there by phrases of the great Chinese sage. This ethical preparation for knowledge is very far removed from the preparation by which a typical rationalist, like Spinoza, may be conceived to draw up his list of axioms and definitions. It is not a search for self- evident premises. It is a cultivation of a finer degree of receptivity to the realities operating in the given world. It is, then, a development of empiricism, rather than of rationalism; an empiricism which pays careful respect to the conditions under which alone the subtler and deeper aspects of the universe can be apprehended. To this extent I must venture to present a caveat to Hu Shih's classification of our philosopher. 21 BRUCE, P. H. N., 170. 22 On the principle of alternation, cf.

CHuIL HSI AND CONTEMPORARY THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE Chu isi uses two metaphors in regard to the knowledge of things. One is that knowledge is a sort of response, a response which ought to be universal. The other is that of penetration of the object. In the passage above quoted, the Mind in knowing is figured as permeating things everywhere as the blood in circulating permeates the body: there is an ' entering into' things, which is said to resemble an infusion of Love into action. In this metaphor, one is immediately reminded of Bergson's language in describing intuition, which in contrast to scientific knowledge,-ab- stract, analytical, relative, adopting points of view from outside,-is con- crete and absolute, 'entering into the object' and 'coinciding with its essence.' Bruce repeatedly and aptly calls attention to the kinship of these two conceptions.23 Now Bergson did not at first regard intuition as subject to ethical conditions. On the contrary, what he later described as deliverances of intuition, namely knowledge of Time and of the Self, he at first de- scribed as " Les donne'es immtedictes de la conscience," an unavoidable sort of perception. In the article of 1903, "IIntroduction a' la meta- physique," he had decided upon the word ' intuition' to designate this special mode of knowledge; and he there described it as a ' sympathetic intelligence,' in which the element of feeling is implied. It is a sort of living-out beyond oneself, an attaining of immediate rapport with the living objects, which called, as he then saw, for an effort contrary 'to the natural slope of the mind!' And this effort, he suggested, might even extend so far as to attain awareness of the principle of unity in things. But it is chiefly in his theory of art that the ethical factor becomes mani- fest (Le Rire, III). Here he represents the artist as metaphysician who reaches by intuitive perception into the nature of living objects. This perception is due to a sort of accident of birth,-the artist is endowed with a non-utilitarian streak in his consciousness of things; at least at one corner of his experience,-optical, auditory . . . -he is emancipated from the pragmatic obsession, the technical interest which attends all scientific observation: he is ' disinterested.' Thus art appears to Bergson as a mode of reporting metaphysical insight, and the insight itself appears to be based on a kind of congenital unselfishness in one spot of human nature. 28 BRUCiE, P. H. N., 61 n.; Chu Hsi and his Masters, 53 n., 251.</page><page sequence="17">CHU HSI'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 125 This power of intuition, then, would be irregularly distributed in the race; and among objects, it would apply only where there are living things which have an 'inside' to be sympathetically apprehended. If there be in the world, as Bergson supposes, a realm of mechanism, the ashes of dead life, there intuitive sympathy would have no application: pragmatic knowledge would be appropriate.24 But Chu Hsi, though he has a repu- tation of being a dualist, has no such realm of inanimate matter: he carries his attribution of life and even of degrees of consciousness throughout the universe much in the spirit of Fechner, Paulsen, White- head. Hence he allows no exceptions in behalf of pragmatically inter- ested modes of knowing. All penetration into the realities of things requires a moral objectivity whose essence is unselfishness. Let the mind go, so that it may be broad and tranquil, and it will be enlarged. Do not let it be prepossessed by the divisive influence of selfish thought, and it will be enlarged.25 As compared with Bergson, then, Chu Hsi has far more for his ethic- ally sensitized intuition to perceive. And because of this he would further disagree with Bergson in his view of the nature of scientific knowledge,- he would not hand science over to the 'pragmatic' way of knowing. What is the distinctive trait of the pragmatic theory of knowledge? It is not that knowledge is in the interest of action,-the most abstruse piece of Buddhist speculation may be that. But it is that knowledge is (partly or wholly) constituted by action; our ideas mean what they lead us to do,-as a sign-post means ' Turn to the right or left '; our judg- ments about the world are instruments for guiding conduct, and are therefore to be chosen, rather than thought out,-to be chosen for the sake of their value as instruments of living. There are anticipations of pragmatism in the theories of Kant and Fichte, following directly upon their views that a theoretical solution of metaphysical problems is impossible. Kant, unwilling to abandon meta- physical judgments, called on the necessities of the moral sense to deter- mine the outlines of a faith. Fichte sharpened the points both of the skepticism and of the will to believe. Critical knowledge, he held, leads (not to Kant's dialectical illusion) but to subjectivism: it frees us from the specter of a material world which dominates us, but at the cost of reducing the world and the self also to a tissue of pictures:-knowledge 24 See on this point the essay, Le Possible et le R6el, in La Pens6e et le Mouvant, Paris, Alcan, 1935. 26 BRUcE, P. H. N., 183 f.</page><page sequence="18">126 WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING cannot reach reality. One thing alone can deliver us from the impasse of pure cognition,-that is action; and action requires a leap of faith. For action undertakes to make changes in a real world, and it cannot go on without treating the images presented in 'knowledge' as valid reports about things outside myself. The resolve so to treat them, involved in the first stroke of action, is founded on a sense of duty: I ought to act; I ought therefore to treat the picture-world as though it were real: Conscience alone is the root of all truth.... If the will be fixedly directed toward the Good, the understanding will of itself apprehend the True. . . . We do not act because we know; but we know because we are called on to act. Fichte ascribes to the moral will here two quite distinguishable func- tions in knowing. First, it lends to the realm of pictures presented by the understanding a validity which permits us to act in it,-to 'take it seriously.' Then, since this element of duty lies at the base of what Santayana has called 'animal faith,' the world takes on the character of being " the object and sphere of my duties, and absolutely nothing more"; and this character determines the choice of alternative metaphysical hypotheses, each consistent and possible but none of which can be proved to the exclusion of the others. In this sense, Fichte " chooses " his world view: I have chosen the system which I have now adopted from among other possible modes of thought, because I have recognized in it the only one consistent with my dignity and my vocation (Bestimmung).26 In so far, then, as Kant and Fichte allow practical considerations to decide truth, they are pragmatists. But they are not pragmatists of the hearty nineteenth century variety. They limited the values Which may govern judgment to moral values; whereas contemporary American prag- matism would allow every value,-convenience, expediency, beauty, social welfare, the class struggle,-to govern one's creed; knowledge is simply one function in the circuits of the active self, and knowledge can live only if, and in so far as, it promotes life. Then again, Kant and Fichte assumed that moral considerations would eliminate every hypothesis but one; conscience would actually decide your metaphysics, if you would allow it. For contemporary pragmatism, however, living adjustments are always fluent, and truth with them: hence nothing is finally decided. Contemporary pragmatism seeks to clothe itself with the kudos of scientific method: since scientific truth is in the interest of action, and 26 J. G. FIcHTE, Bestimm~ung des Menschen.</page><page sequence="19">CHU HSI'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 127 has to be verified. But, as we have seen, neither of these is a mark of pragmatism. Scientific method is based on the deliberate and persistent effort to escape the circle of humanistic interests, not to say class interests, in its discovery of objective truth. It is thus radically hostile to prag- matism in its contemporary form; and contemporary pragmatism is radically hostile to science. Is the same thing to be said of the partial pragmatism of Kant and Fichte? It is quite possible to regard the whole modern scientific effort, from the sixteenth century onward, as an effort inspired by an ethical con- sideration. Empiricism is itself a form of self-denial, a moral will to let the object speak for itself. But empiricism holds that if we allow it to do so, the object will speak,-i. e., truth is accessible. This is what the pragmatist ignores. Pragmatism, whether in science or in meta- physics, can promise no vision of the real; it is just because it holds that there can be no vision that it calls upon us to choose in the dark. Hence scientific method is hostile even to the tempered pragmatism -of Kant and Fichte; and in this respect, Chu Hsi is with scientific method and against the pragmatists. For his view is that vision is possible; and the moral conditions are not to replace it, but to lead to it. The role of the moral preparation for the higher knowledge is at once sensitization and adjustment; its object is the improvement of the organ of perception. It is an intuition which is to be achieved, a rapport with the object, not a selection from among unprovable theories. Especially important, in Chu Hsi's interpretation of these ethical con- ditions of insight is that they are not, as generally in the Buddhist schools, addressed to the development of unusual or occult powers. The discipline called for by Chu Hsi is open to every man in every occupation; and since the original nature of every man is pure and right, there is nothing to prevent any man from arriving at the insight of the sage. The moral conditions surrender not to special talent, but to the good will which is within reach of all. In this way the Neo-Confucianism of the Sung philosophers adapts to the Mencian formula the Buddhist doctrine that the Buddha nature is in each human being. Thus, while the door to the democracy of 'scientific knowledge-' was not yet fully open in the thought of Chu Hsi, the door was open to a more fundamental democracy, the call that is upon every man to maintain the moral conditions of clear-headedness, and to share with his neighbors a direct knowledge of the first principles of Being, which are at the same time, the principles of right living. Modern democracy requires both aspects of knowledge, and may well learn this from Chu Hsi.</page></plain_text>
