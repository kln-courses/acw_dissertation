They have been termed runways for alien spacecraft, an- cient Olympic raceways, and the largest astronomy text on earth- a wonder to be comprehended only when viewed from above. They are the celebrated Nasca geoglyphs etched on the warm foggy desert known as the pampa on the south coast of Peru. They are located between river val- leys that precipitously carry water down 3000 to 5000 m from the high Andes to the Pacific coast over the relatively short distance of 100 km. The hundreds of straight lines</page><page sequence="2">334 Book Reviews kilometers in length and varying between a few centimeters and tens of meters in width, trapezoids up to 1000 m long, and curious lesser numbers of geometric spirals, zig-zags, and biomorphic figures (mostly birds, fish, and plants) that cover more than 100 sq km, were made by the process of removal of desert-varnished stone deposited there in flood epochs tens of thousands of years ago. Like the decorations on Nasca ceramics the figures are starkly revealed by the borders that outline them, in this case made by the careful piling of the dark detritus that was cleared to make up their interiors. The Nasca lines have adorned the pop -archaeology lit- erature ever since Maria Reiche (1976), an immigrant tu- tor of mathematics, dedicated her life to decoding their presumed mathematical and astronomical secrets, an idea she acquired from the geographer and anthropologist Paul Kosok (1965) more than half a century ago. Just as ama- teur astronomer Percival Lowell's early 20th century tele- scopic gleanings about the Martian canals led to his own bizarre interpretation of that planet as an abode of life for a race of high-tech aliens united in the single-minded goal of saving a water starved planet, thereby dissuading two generations of serious professionals from planetary studies, so too the touristic attention brought to the lines (over- flights in small planes continue at the rate of up to 100 a day) by Reiche's intellectual ownership of the pampa drove most serious archaeologists away from examining them close up. For other examples of this sort of phenomenon in the history of archaeology, see Fowler (1987). Despite the persistence of bizarre theories regarding their origin and function: a tidal calculator, a world map, Olympic raceways, art forms to be perceived by indigenous balloonists, etc. (see Aveni 1990a for a full account), the as- tronomical theory has continued to dominate the litera- ture, often being mentioned in academic textbooks. Only when serious studies were undertaken via largely ground-based work in the 1980s (Reinhard 1986; Aveni 1990; Aveni and Silverman 1991; Silverman and Proulx 2002), did the geoglyphs on the flat region between the Ingenio and Nasca rivers come to be understood in an An- dean cultural context as part of a continuing tradition in- volving social and religious concepts. To those familiar with them, the Nasca geoglyphs are now thought to have been organized and maintained by work/kin- related groups (so-called ayllus) within the framework of a wa- ter/mountain cult. They were spaces to be moved, walked, danced over- assembly areas rather than two-dimensional earthworks meant to be experienced from above. Second only to the Nasca pampa in area covered by ge- oglyphs is that of Palpa. Located just 50 km to the nw, the Palpa geoglyphs cover an 89 sq km area that is not as flat as the Nasca pampa. Moreover, Palpa presents a denser concentration of geoglyphs, a significantly larger number of giant trapezoids, and considerably fewer figural draw- ings. Most of geoglyphs are positioned close to the valleys, where settlements lay. All of these factors provide an excel- lent environment for testing and advancing culturally based models to account for their origin and evolution. The Palpa figures are the subject of Karsten Lambers' ex- pansion of a doctoral dissertation at the University of Zurich and part of a wider joint archaeological and pho- togrammetric study. This welcome contribution applies aerial photogrammetry and GIS technology to the archae- ological database. The presentation begins with a brief crit- ical review of previous research methods and contributors to Nasca research, pointing out shortcomings centered around underrepresented connections between proposed pampa activity and the archaeological record, a deficiency Lambers proposes to remedy by placing the former in the specific context of a regional settlement pattern survey and excavations at two adjacent sites. The introductory part of the work, Chapters 1-4, ends with Lambers' own careful- ly articulated hypothetical formulation of culturally based accounts of Nasca phenomena, which he calls the "Andean model" [39-43, fig 5], The lengthier chapters, a part of Chapter 4 on the de- tailed documentation of the Palpa geoglyphs and Chapter 6 on the archaeological analysis, make up the bulk of Lam- bers' contribution to Nasca studies. His photogrammetric survey generates a database consisting of a geometric mod- el of the topography with a 2 m mesh size, and a virtual, interactive, three-dimensional model of the geoglyphs, to- gether with maps of the geoglyphs at a variety of scales. Lambers' taxonomy of geoglyphs differs little from those of his predecessors (Aveni 1990b: 92), though it is more detailed, especially regarding the shapes of lineal ge- oglyphs and their mode of construction: positive, meaning a cleared inner space framed by heaped boulders vs. the more multi-faceted but rarer combined class, in which the interim portion incorporates other elements (this turns out to be a later phenomenon). Of the 639 Palpa geoglyphs surveyed, over 90% are geometric and over 60% are lineal, the remainder being U- shaped (a type not reported at Nasca), zig-zags, spirals, and meanders. Biomorphs are less abundant on the Palpa than on the Nasca pampa. Unlike the lineals at Nasca, those at Palpa do not criss-cross the entire pampa and, most im- portantly, the ray centers that articulate the structure of the 800 lines surveyed at Nasca are almost totally absent on the Palpa pampa. In examining the Karsten maps, this review- er was able to detect perhaps a dozen such complexes, but they clearly seem to have played a minor role. In stark con-</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Arch neology /Vol. 31, 2006 335 trast, at Nasca one can scarcely find a straight line that does not connect to a ray center. Palpa is different! Chronometric dating based largely on associated finds places the height of Palpa glyph-making activity in the Ear- ly and Middle Nasca ceramic phases (Nasca 2-4, especial- ly Nasca 3), but also reveals that such activity, though di- minished, nonetheless extended over two millennia from the Early Horizon to the Late Intermediate, following the Wari occupation, when stone buildings were constructed on top of the geoglyphs in ways that suggest that they were no longer important, or at least that their function had changed. A comparison of the Lambers plot of the number of geoglyphs with associated ceramics per chronological phase [fig. 28] to that at Nasca (Clarkson 1990, figs III- 15, 16) shows a similar distribution. The distribution of datable fineware ceramics deposited on the geoglyphs indicates no chronological bias with re- gard to Lambers' taxonomic typology, but stratigraphic studies seem to suggest that the anthropomorphic geo- glyphs may have been created earlier. Elaborate and precise articulation such as that found in the Nasca Monkey, Con- dor, and Hummingbird are absent at Palpa. Zig-zags, spi- rals, and meanders also seem to predate the large trape- zoids. Nasca studies also place the biomorphs and spirals earlier in time than the other forms, but the question of chronology is by no means settled. (The present reviewer continues to hold the opinion that the Nasca biomorphs had little to do with the lines.) One of Lambers' major contributions is his documenta- tion to support the hypothesis that the forms of these ear- ly Palpa figural geoglyphs possess elements with regard to motif and iconography that tie them to the Paracas tradi- tion. Lambers thinks that geoglyphs developed out of pet- roglyphs (see also Reindel and Isla 1999) via transfer to an adjacent medium. Like the Nasca sample there is evidence that the geoglyphs were repeatedly walked on. Especially on flat areas, sandy layers appear heavily compacted. Inter- estingly, figures constructed on hillsides do not share in this property; furthermore they show fewer ceramic de- posits, thus indicating that they may have had a different function. Unlike their Nasca counterparts, the straight-line geoglyphs were neither roads nor pathways. Other evi- dence that ritual activity took place on the lines includes the enormous amount of deliberately broken ceramic fineware, spondylus shells, and bits of field crops deposited on the lines, as well as the erection of wooden posts accompanied by the placement of offerings in adjacent excavated pits. Also, as at Nasca, there is evidence of reconstruction and maintenance of geoglyphs. Lambers believes this might ne- cessitate upward reassessment of the time consumed in cre- ating them. Via a series of maps, Lambers presents infor- mation related to possible access routes to the Palpa geo- glyphs through time. Hypothetical routes are based on least (energy) cost pathways utilizing a calculational tool that considers degree of slope as the main factor in the de- termination of the likely direction of movement. These da- ta are reflected against settlement history based on archae- ological studies to yield information on the spatial disposi- tion of geoglyphs and sites. Results indicate that glyph building began away from the valley margins and expand- ed along the margins until all the available nearby regions were exhausted. Geoglyph construction increased during the highly active Early and Middle Nasca periods, when the settlements revealed a demographic peak, then later moved to the large, high plateaus. Lambers meticulously traces these developments from sub-region to sub-region throughout the Palpa environs. The appendices constitute a valuable supplement that enables readers to follow the arguments in detail. These in- clude a select description of specific archaeological contexts (stratigraphy and excavations) and a brief excavation report on the stone structures, which consist of elongated plat- forms on the edge of plateaus and rectangular platforms on trapezoids. Lambers' orientation studies show that glyph directions cover all degrees of the compass, with local topography be- ing a predominating factor, as at Nasca. Likewise there is a preference for orientations along the directions of the ridges and perpendiculars thereto. One can readily discern both these trends from a visual inspection of Lambers' maps. There is no evidence that the Palpa geoglyphs point to mountains and no astronomical orientations are pro- posed, though there is no clear indication in the text that the latter question ever was tested in any detail. The corre- lation between line orientation and surface water mirrors what already has been disclosed at Nasca, and there is no evidence to support the bizarre notion that the geoglyphs were coded to indicate the location of subsurface water. How then does the Andean model fare in the presence of the voluminous data marshaled by Lambers ? This is the subject of Chapter 7. Reading it, one acquires a sense of the pampa as a dynamic locale, a stage teeming with people in- teracting to affirm and reaffirm their social status. One has a better sense of chronological development and readers discover formal connections between the pampa and valley settlements. Despite the general nature of the Andean model and the difficulty of testing it directly via archaeolo- gy (which Lambers himself acknowledges), the study por- trays the Palpa geoglyphs as the result of a complex, guid- ed expression of worldview that involved a considerable in- vestment of manpower over a period of some 1200 years. Finally, one cannot review this work without remarking</page><page sequence="4">336 Book Reviews that Lambers' presentation is a handsome work of art; it is amply adorned with excellent documentary photos, and 10 accompanying large fold- out maps, all neatly boxed. It gives readers the best view (short of a visit) of what the Pal- pa pampa is really like.
