<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iranian Studies, volume 36, number 4, December 2003 Kristin Zahra Sands On the Popularity of Husayn Vaciz-i Kashifi's Mavahib-i caliyya: A Persian Commentary on the Qur'an HUNDREDS OF MANUSCRIPT COPIES OF THE QUR'ANIC COMMENTARY OF HUSAYN B. cAli Vaciz-i Kashifi (d. 910/1504-05), known as the Mavahib-i caliyya or Tafsfr-i Husaynr, have been catalogued in libraries and personal collections throughout Iran, Central Asia, Pakistan and India.' The enormous popularity of Kashifi's commentary, which was known simply as Tafsfr-i Mulli, can be understood primarily by its unique accessibility and literary quality. Although Kashifi himself was well-versed in the many different sciences of commentary,2 the Mavaihib rarely addresses the kind of lin- guistic, philological, legal and theological issues that would require an extensive back- ground in Arabic and Islamic religious scholarship. Instead, Kashifi combined an explanatory translation of Qur'anic verses in simple, concise Persian with highly selective citations from other works of tafsrr and Sufi poetry and prose, to create a remarkably short work for a commentary addressing the entire Qur'an. The Mav.hib's Place among Persian Commentaries The history of Persian commentaries on the Qur'an begins with a translation of the Jilmic al-bayian of Abu Jacfar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 310/923). Following a ruling by a group of scholars on the permissibility of translating and writing Qur'anic exegesis in Persian, the translation was commissioned by Abu Salih Mansur b. Nuh, the Samanid ruler of Transoxania and Khurasan from 350/961 to 366/976.3 Once this Kristin Zahra Sands is a Mellon Fellow and Professor of Islamic Studies at Sarah Lawrence College. 1. C. A. Storey states that copies of the Mavahib are "too common to deserve complete enumeration" and notes that translations exist in Turkish, Urdu and Pashtu-Persian Literature: A Bio-bibliographical Survey (London, 1970), 1: 12-13. Although the tafstr has been lithographed many times in India, the only printed edition to date is the one edited by Muhammad Jalali Na&amp;ini (Tehran, 1938-50). 2. A fact that is demonstrated in the Qur'anic commentary Kashifi began but never finished before the Mavahib, Javiihir al-tafsir. Javwhir al-tafsrr is a much more detailed and scholarly commentary than the Mavahib. Javad cAbbasi has edited and published the introduction and commentary on the first sura (Tehran, 2000). 3.

Two of the most important Persian commentaries were written within a century and a half of the Tabari translation, the Rawd al-jinan wa-rawh al-jananfi tafsfr al-Qurhdn4 of Abu'l-Futuh al- Razi (d. ca. 525/1131) and the Kashf al-asrar wa-cuddat al-abrdr5 of Rashid al-Din al- Maybudi (fl. 520/1126). These commentaries reflect the two dominant influences in Persian commentaries to follow-Shicism and Sufism. Abu'l-Futuh Razi's tafstr is 6 considered the earliest, or one of the earliest, of the Shici commentaries in Persian. In structure and content, it resembles the important Arabic Shici commentary, al-Tibyan ft tafsfr al-Qur'an written by Muhammad Abu Jacfar al-Tusi (d. 460/1067).7 The other trend in Persian commentaries is exemplified by Rashid al-Din al-Maybudi's Kashf al- asrair, a tafsrr that can be characterized as Sufi-inspired and literary. Each section of the commentary is divided into three parts, the first of which is a literal Persian trans- lation and paraphrase of the Qur'anic Arabic verses. The second part, written in both Persian and Arabic, addresses philological, narrative, juridical, and theological issues as found in the Sunni exegetical tradition. The third part, also written in both Persian and Arabic, presents Sufi interpretations, drawing extensively on the commentaries of CAbd Allah al-Ansari al-Haravi (d. 481/1089)8 and Abu'l-Qasim CAbd al-Karim al- Qushayri (d. 465/1074),9 as well as other Sufi figures. Husayn Vaciz-i Kashifi's Mavahib-i caliyya, composed in 897/1491-899/1494, is generally classified, like al-Maybudi's, as a literary and Sufi tafsrr. Kashifi began his exegetical writing with a very large and comprehensive tafstr entitled Javahir al-tafstr li-tuhfat al-amtr which was written for his patron Mir cAli Shir Nawa3i (d. 906/1501), a courtier to the Timurid ruler Sultan Husayn Bayqara (d. 911/1506). Although he had intended to write a commentary on the entire Qur'an, Kashifi stopped writing the Javahir al-tafstr after reaching the beginning of the fourth sura. He completed the much shorter Maviahib-i Caliyya several years later and dedicated it as well to cAli Shir. Like al-Maybudi's Kashf al-asrar, the Mavahib combines exoteric and Sufi mate- rial but does not clearly separate the two. In addition to quoting many of the same sources as al-Maybudi, Kashifi adds later Sufi figures such as Ibn al-cArabi (d. 638/1240), CAbd al-Razzaq al-Kashani (d. 730/1329), Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi (d. 673/1274), and shaykhs from the Kubrawi and Naqshbandi Sufi orders. Kashifi also quotes the Persian poetry of CAbd Allah al-Ansari al-Haravi, Abu'l-Majd Sanali (d. 525/1131), Farid al-Din cAttar (d. 627/1230), Jalal al-Din Rumi (d. 672/1273), and 4.

The use of poetry to comment on the meaning of a verse was a practice of Sufi exegetes long before Kashifi, but Kashifi took the incorporation of poetry to a new level, rarely writing more than a page in the Mavaihib without citing a few lines. The use of poetry to com- ment on the meaning of a verse as a whole is a phenomenon specific to Sufis in this time period. Non-Sufi commentators used poetry, but only as a means to analyze the etymology and meaning of individual words and phrases found in the Qur'an.10 The Mavahib-i caliyya is important not only because of its popularity but also because of its influence on later Persian and Arabic commentators. In his tafstr entitled Minhaj al-sddiqinft ilzam al-mukhdliftn," the early Safavid exegete, Mulla Fath Allah al-Kashani (d. ca. 988/1580), uses Persian translations and paraphrases of the Qur'anic text which follow almost word for word those found in the Mavahib-i caliyya. Al- Kashani also follows Kashifi's organization of material, although he expands it by reinserting the Arabic of the original exegetical sources and by including additional material. The most significant difference between the two works is that Kashifi avoids sectarian material, while Kashani presents and emphatically argues for the Shici inter- pretation of many Qur'anic verses. Another commentator influenced by Kashifi is the Turkish exegete, Ismacil Haqqi Brusawi (d. 1137/1724-25). Ismacil Haqqi quotes from Kashifi throughout his Tafsrr ruih al-baydn'2 and adopts his practice of quoting Persian poetry extensively, despite the fact that the predominant language of Ismacil Haqqi's commentary is Arabic. Kashifi's Discussion of Qur'anic Hermeneutics in the Javahir al-tafsir Kashifi's exegetical style in both his commentaries is based on a hermeneutical theory set forth in the introduction to his Javazhir al-tafstr. Particularly noteworthy in this lengthy exposition and discussion of the sciences of commentary and the accepted practices for reading the Qur'an are the sections in which Kashifi summarizes and then elegantly elaborates on the writings of his Sufi predecessors. While he insists, like most Sufis, on the validity of both exoteric and esoteric exegesis, he emphasizes and privileges the latter: The science of commentary (tafsrr) is comprised of twenty-two types, some of which are like husks and some of which are like kernels, so that one who is intent upon knowing the Qur'an has no other way than by knowing them.'3 10. This is the way in which poetry is used in such commentaries as al-Tabari's Jamic al- bayan (Cairo, 1954-57), al-Zamakhshari's al-Kashshiif Can haqaViq al-tanzil (Cairo, 1966), and al-Qurtubi's al-Jamic li'l-ahkaim (Beirut, 1980). 11.

Kashifi, Javahir al-tafsrr, 127.</page><page sequence="4">472 Sands According to Kashifi, knowledge of the meanings of the Qur'an is obtained in three different ways. The first way is by studying the transmitted tradition (rivayat), which Kashifi defines as sound and correctly transmitted material from the Prophet, the immaculate imams (a3imma macsamin), and the religious scholars among the Com- panions and Followers of the Prophet, as transmitted through the religious scholars of each time period. The second type of knowledge of the meanings of the Qur'an is knowledge (dirayat) of the Arabic language and the other sciences connected to the Qur'an and ahtdTth, which are acquired through study. The third type of knowledge is not acquired through study, but is received directly from God (cilm laduni): Another group, with the help of divine grace by means of sound unveiling (kashf) and pure taste (dhawq), are able to find their way to the Qur'anic sub- tleties and realities. Their words are the innermost kernels of the Book of the Lord of lords, and the science of these people is ladunt, that is to say it is bestowed upon them from near to God, without the intermediary of learning from anyone else, just as God Most High said, We taught him knowledge from Our presence (1 8:65).'4 They read this as well from bequeathed knowledge (viraisat), [a term] taken from the saying of the Messenger, 'Whoever prac- tices what he has learned, God will bequeath to him knowledge of what he did not know.' 15 Kashifi summarizes the three types of study and knowledge by playing on the rhymes of the words dirasat,firasat, and virdsat; and rivayat, dirayat, and vilayat: Mastering the meanings of the Qur'an, then, will either be by study (diriasat), and the people who do that are learned in transmission (rivayat); or by dis- cernment (flrirsat), and the people who are known for that are those learned in acquired knowledge (dirayat); or by bequeathed knowledge (virasat), and they are designated as the people of sanctity (viliyat). Although the sights seen by those who receive unveilings will differ according to the various self- disclosures of God (tajalliydt) and each will suggest a different expression of what was meant, nonetheless the root of all of these words, in truth, goes back to one truth. Verse: Our expression is manifold but Your beauty is one. 16 Among the many kinds of sciences used in commentary which Kashifi describes is the science of interpretation (ta'vrl). He devotes an entire section to the controversy concerning the difference in meaning between the words ta'vil and tafstr.17 Although these terms were used interchangeably by many early Qur'anic commentators, ta'vtl 14.

Ibid., 222-26.</page><page sequence="5">Mavilhib-i Caliyya 473 came to be understood as interpretations which deviate from the obvious or external sense of the words, whether those interpretations are theological, metaphorical, or esoteric. Kashifi situates ta'vtl among the categories he has already established for ways of seeking knowledge of Qur'anic meanings, defining it as an intellectual (caqlf) process performed by jurists and theologians, as opposed to tafstr which is what has traditionally been transmitted (naqlh) from the Companions of the Prophet. Ta'vil will involve setting right (rast kardan) the external sense of some Qur'anic words and verses. While there were a minority of religious scholars who insisted that the external sense of the Qur'an must never be abandoned, a claim they supported by reference to a hadhth stating that whoever speaks of the Qur'an from his own opinion (ra'y) should take his seat in the fire, Kashifi sides with the majority who viewed it as permissible and even necessary, provided words were not taken out of context and provided the resulting interpretations did not disagree with the Qur'an and the sunna. It was an interpretative strategy broadly used to explain anthropomorphic verses whose literal meanings were considered unacceptable. Kashifi notes that tafsrr refers to only one sense (vajh), whereas ta'vil suggests many possible senses (vujah) and therefore may lead to divergent and even conflicting interpretations. Although Kashifi confines the meaning of tadvil to an intellectual rather than a mystical process, he appears, like Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (d. 505/1111),'8 to use the permissibility of tazvil to justify open-ended Sufi interpretation. Kashifi begins his section on the science of "realities" (haqW'iq) and "allusions" (ishiiriit), with ahiidth attributed to the Prophet, which contain the same term used throughout the ta'vil dis- cussion, i.e., "senses" (vujuih). He quotes the first hadth from the Tafsir haqa3iq al- Qur'dn of Abu CAbd al-Rahman al-Sulami (d. 412/1021): "The Qur'an possesses many senses (wujah), so interpret it according to the best of its senses." Another hadtth comes from al-Ghazali's Wujuh wa na;a3ir: "A man will not fully understand until he realizes that the Qur'an has many senses (wujah)."'9 Kashifi also refers to the hadTth most frequently quoted in Sufi hermeneutical dis- cussions that states there are four levels of meaning in the Qur'an: "The Qur'an has a back (;ahr), a belly (batn), a limit (hadd) and a lookout point (muttalac)." Kashifi quotes two slightly different interpretations of the hadtth. The first is cited without attribution, but appears to be a Persian adaptation of a passage from the introduction to the Ta3wrllt al-QurJan of CAbd al-Razzaq al-Kashani: They say that the back (;ahr) is tafsTr, which is useful for the Arabists; and the belly (batn) is ta'vtl, which blesses the possessors of certain knowledge according to their various states and circumstances; and the limit (hadd), which is the farthest one can go in understanding the meanings of speech; and the lookout point (muttalaC), the high step upon which one may rise to receive 18.

Ibid., 276.</page><page sequence="6">474 Sands that knowledge (ittild') by the lights of witnessing the all-knowing speaker.20 In the Bahr al-haqa&amp;iq it is said that the external part (;dhir) of the Qur'an is reciting and reading, its inner part (batin) is for the sake of understanding (fahm) and study (dirayat), and its limit (hadd) is the commandment of what is permitted and prohibited, and its lookout point (muttalaC) is what God (al- haqq) intended by the words.2' While al-Kashani uses the term ta3vil to refer to Sufi interpretation, Kashifi's her- meneutical terminology and theory are closer to the last part of the above-cited passage from the Bahr al-haqaViq.22 In both this section and the section on the difference between tafsir and ta'vtl, Kashifi uses the term batin in a very broad sense to refer to legal, theological, and mystical interpretations, reserving ;dhir for the external wording and recitation of the Qur'an and its commentary by those knowledgeable in the Arabic language and the material transmitted from the Companions of the Prophet. One other section of Kashifi's introduction to his Javahir al-tafstr warrants men- tion here and that is the section in which he writes what amounts to an extensive adap- tation and reworking of passages from al-Ghazali's Ihy&amp;' Culam al-dfn,23 although neither the author nor the title of the work is ever mentioned. Using the chapters from the IhyaV on the ten external courtesies (acdab) and ten inner practices (aCmdl) which should be observed in reciting the Qur'an, Kashifi selects, changes, and adds to al- Ghazali's version. In many passages, he enhances al-Ghazali's basic ideas with lines of poetry, as in the section on abandoning the obstacles to understanding the deeper meanings of the Qur'an. Kashifi, following al-Ghazali, states that the veils to under- standing are four: remaining with the exoteric sciences (literally, the "husk-like" sci- ences), unquestioning acceptance of doctrine (taqlrd), being afflicted with blamewor- thy qualities, and confining the meaning of the Qur'an to what one learns from exoteric tafsrr, believing that no other meaning is possible. The passage on the last veil reads: The fourth veil is limiting the meaning of the Qur'an, that is, a person studies exoteric commentary and believes that there is no other meaning in the Qur'an other than this commentary. Content with this transmission alone, the scent of the fragrance of the wine of passion does not reach his soul. Quatrain: 20. Cf. Kashani, Ta'wflht al-Qur'an, 5.

But if one day you come to the gambling house, you will know that all your life you have been a fraud.24 Kashifi's Persian version of al-Ghazali's material retains the latter's clear and systematic approach while creating a new aesthetic for the same material. It is a style he continues in the Maviahib-i caliyya, a commentary that reflects two of Kashifi's three categories of tafsir. Generally avoiding the intellectual interpretations of jurists and theologians (ta'vrl-i caqli), Kashifi confines himself to transmitted material (naqlt) and Sufi realities (haqa iq) and allusions (ishiariit). Kashifi's Style and Method in the Mavahib Originality in exegesis is expressed primarily by the manner in which a commentator selects, organizes, and presents material written and transmitted by others. Kashifi's Mavahib is distinctive and original because it combines a very readable Persian trans- lation of the Qur'an with a very manageable amount of interesting exegetical material. Kashifi generally avoids difficult material from both religious scholars and Sufi theo- rists, selecting instead stories, poetry and explanations that would enrich anyone' s experience of reading the Qur'anic text. The result is a remarkably accessible work for readers unqualified or uninterested in addressing the intricacies of most Qur'anic commentaries. A good example of Kashifi's attractive and accessible style can be seen in his treatment of the sura Luqman. One of the themes of this sura is the difference between those stories and other forms of entertainment that distract one from remembering God, and stories that both amuse and edify, such as those told about the wisdom of Luqman. Verse 31: 6 reads: There are those among men who buy frivolous talk in order to lead [men] astray from the path of God without knowledge, and the2y take it as an object of ridicule. Those people have a humiliating punishment. As he does for every verse of the Qur'an, Kashifi provides a Persian translation of the Arabic with additional, explanatory comments: There are those among men who buy frivolous talk 24. Ibid., 272. 25. Although I consulted the translations of A. J. Arberry, A. Yusuf Ali, and M. Asad, the translation of the Qur'an here is my own.</page><page sequence="8">476 Sands It has been said that [frivolous talk means] deceitful or distracting talk, i.e., [among men is one who] prefers stories that have no merit, in order to lead [men] astray from the path of God, meaning from His religion; or holding them back from listening to and reciting the Qur'an, without knowledge or proof, and they take the path of God as an object of ridicule mocking and deriding it. Those people have a humiliating punishment that is captivity or death in this world and a humiliating punishment in the life to come.26 Kashifi gives two possible reasons for the revelation of this verse. The first one states that the verse was revealed concerning a Meccan who felt he could compete with Muhammad as a storyteller, luring potential converts away from him: It has been related that Nasr b. Harith had gone to Persia on a trading trip and purchased the story of Rustam and Isfandiyar. He was reciting the story in gatherings of the Quraysh in such a way that they all became enamored and seduced by it, and he boasted, 'Although Muhammad tells the stories of the CAd and Thamud, and stories of the grandeur of the Kings Solomon and David, I speak of the sower of the kingdoms of Persia and the abundant splendor of their kings.' The second explanation given for the revelation of the verse concerns the Mec- cans' practice of purchasing and selling singing slave girls: They say that the verse is about the matter of buying singing slave girls and the men who were so preoccupied with listening to their voices and singing, that they were held back from listening to God's words.28 What has been left out of Kashifi's commentary here is as significant as what was included. Kashifi neatly summarizes the explanations for the revelation of this verse, but leaves out much of the material found in other commentaries, such as the names of the Companions of the Prophet who originally transmitted these occasions of revela- tions, the numerous hadlths concerning singing slave girls, and the legal discussion on 26. Kashifi, Mavazhib, 3: 441. 27. Ibid., 3: 440. 28. Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">Mavcahib-i Caliyya 477 the permissibility of Muslims' singing.29 This material, which is omitted in Kashifi, helps Muslims to clearly define the parameters of acceptable Muslim behavior according to the sources deemed most authoritative. Kashifi's exegesis, however, is content to leave the reader with the idea that the verse is about entertainment that dis- tracts rather than edifies, without getting into legalistic details. The end result is that his commentary more effectively draws the reader's attention to the comparison between the two types of entertainment. The stories about Luqman that Kashifi quotes in his commentary on the Qur'anic phrase, We gave wisdom to Luqman (verse 31: 12), serve then to illustrate praiseworthy storytelling. Before telling these stories, Kashifi orients his readers to the possible time and cir- cumstances of Luqman's life, using a variety of older exegetical sources. One of the issues which preoccupied early Qur'anic commentators was whether or not Luqman was a prophet. Kashifi briefly summarizes their differing views, telling us that a minority of religious scholars have held the view that Luqman was a prophet and that he was connected to other prophets either by blood (as a maternal nephew or cousin of the prophet Job or as the great grandson of Abraham's father), or through acquaintance (as a contemporary of the Prophet David). The majority view, however, and the one that makes for better storytelling, has been that Luqman was not a prophet but rather a remarkable slave who became a respected wise man. He is described as an Abyssinian or Nubian slave, black-skinned and thick-lipped, who worked either as a shepherd, a tailor, or a carpenter.30 In the first story Kashifi relates, Luqman indicates his disinterest in attaining the power he lacks as a slave: One day, at the time of the afternoon nap, a group of angels came to Luq- man's house and greeted him. He greeted them in kind, only he could not see them. They said, 'Luqman, we are angels of your Lord come to make you the ruler (khalhfa) of the earth so that you can judge wisely among men.' Luqman answered, 'If this work is a command from my Lord, I hear, obey and accept, and I hope that he grants me success and assistance. But, if I am given the choice, I choose well-being over being subjected to tribulation.' The angels were astonished by these words. God was pleased with his speech and gave him wisdom to such an extent that ten thousand words of wisdom have been transmitted from him, every one of which is worthy of a learned man.31 29. In his J.hmic al-baydn (Cairo, 1954), 21: 60-64, al-Tabari presents the basic material, which in turn was repeated by later commentators such as al-Qurtubi (d. 671/1272), who presents a particularly detailed summary of the different views on the permissibility of singing (Beirut, 1980), 14: 51-55. 30. Kashifi, Maviahib, 3: 442-43. 31. Kashifi, Mavaihib, 3: 443.</page><page sequence="10">478 Sands Although Luqman is not interested in rank, he nonetheless achieves it by virtue of the wisdom granted to him by God, a fact that amazes those who stand above him in the social hierarchy: One day, an important man among the Israelites passed by Luqman. A group of men were sitting and standing by him, listening to his words of wisdom. The important man said to Luqman, 'Aren't you the black slave that was the shepherd of so-and-so's flock?' He said, 'I am.' The man asked him, 'What brought you to this rank?' He answered, 'Being truthful in speech and trust- worthy, and leaving off what does not concern me.'32 Kashifi's final story demonstrates Luqman's cleverness in confronting an unjust accusation: Regarding the wisdom of Luqman, it is said that one day his master sent him with his other slaves out to the garden to get some fruit. The other slaves ate the fruit on the way but blamed Luqman for it, so that the master became angry at him. Luqman said, 'They have eaten the fruit but have falsely accused me.' The master said, 'How can the truth of this be known?' Luqman said, 'Give us hot water to drink and make us run in a field so that we vomit. Whoever throws up fruit is the liar.'33 Although these amusing stories can be found in most commentaries on this verse, they play a more prominent role in Kashifi's exegesis because they make up the greater part of his commentary. Kashifi further enhances the didactic value of these stories by adding material from Sufi writers. In his commentary on this verse, Kashifi quotes from Jalal al-Din Rumi's version of the story of Luqman and the fruit from the Mas- navi: The master gave the servants hot water to drink, and they drank it in fear (of him). Afterwards he was driving them into the plains, and they were running this way and that. From distress they began to vomit: the (hot) water was bringing up the fruit from them. When Luqman began to vomit from his navel (belly), there was coming up from him (only) pure water. Inasmuch as Luqman's wisdom can show forth this, then what must be the wisdom of the Lord of existence! On the day when all the inmost thoughts shall be searched out, there will appear from you something latent, (the appearance of) which is not desired. 32. Kashifi, Mavahib, 3: 443-44. 33. Kashifi, Mavahib, 3: 444.</page><page sequence="11">Mavazhib-i caliyya 479 When they shall be given hot water to drink, all the veils will be cut asunder (torn off) from that which is abhorred. Anything that is concealed will be made public and anyone who has been deceitful will be disgraced.34 Rumi's telling of this story adds some wonderful imagery to the original tale, enriching its meaning by using the slaves' vomiting as a metaphor for what happens in the Afterlife when peoples' true natures are revealed. The hot water of the story becomes the hot water mentioned in the Qur'an as one of the punishments of Hell. Not all exoteric commentators viewed the use of poetry such as Rumi's Masnavt as a legitimate form of exegesis, because it could be said to express merely personal opinion. Sufis such as al-Maybudi acknowledged the controversial nature of their commentaries by dividing them into exoteric and esoteric sections, and in general did not use the word "tafstr" for the esoteric portions. Kashifi, however, mixes the exoteric and esoteric material together, which has the effect of giving more legitimacy to Rumi's Masnavt as Qur'anic interpretation. After quoting Rumi's Masnavt, he returns to material from early exoteric exegetical sources, although he chooses a short anec- dote that sounds as if a Sufi could have written it: One day [the prophet] David asked Luqman, 'How did you become like this?' He answered, 'I became like this between the two hands of another,' meaning the two hands of God's grace and justice. David reflected upon these words, and then cried out and fainted.35 Sufism and Shicism in the Mavahib In examining the popularity of the Mavaihib, one of the questions which arises is the extent to which controversial interpretations associated with Sufism and Shicism occur in Kashifi's commentary. The occurrence of these interpretations would not only tell us something about Kashifi, but also something about his readers.36 Kashifi's interest in Sufi thought can be studied through the commentaries he quotes on Qur'anic verse 8: 17. It is a verse most commonly believed to refer to the Battle of Badr, a battle in which the Muslims were greatly outnumbered by their Meccan enemies, yet succeeded 34.

Muhammad is said to have taken a handful of sand or pebbles and thrown it towards the enemy at the beginning of the battle. The Qur'anic verse reads: So you (the Muslims) did not kill them, but God killed them, and you (Muhammad) did not throw when you threw, but God threw. This was so that He might grant the believers a benefit from Himself. Surely God is Hearing, Knowing. Most Qur'anic commentators saw the verse as a rebuke to the boasts of some of the Muslim fighters. They also saw in it an allusion to the miracle that happened when Muhammad threw a handful of sand or pebbles that somehow reached each and every one of the enemy fighters, diminishing their strength. Many commentators raised a theological issue here as well concerning the nature of man's actions, with most agreeing that God is the creator of man and his acts, although man then somehow "acquires" these acts. Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali mentions the interpretation of this verse in his defense of Sufi exegesis in the Ihya' Culium al-dtn, suggesting that its exact wording hints at a reality not easily understood: The outward interpretation of this verse is clear, but its real meaning is diffi- cult to comprehend because it both affirms the throwing and negates it. This seems contradictory unless one understands that he threw from one perspec- tive and did not throw from another and that from the perspective from which he did not throw, God, may He be exalted, threw...the real meaning of this is derived from a vast ocean of the sciences of unveiling ('ulhm al-mukashafa). Outward interpretation is of no help with it.37 Al-Ghazali is referring here to Sufi interpretations that see in this verse an allusion to the state in which the individual ego is annihilated and God becomes a human's "hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks."38 More than two hundred years after al-Ghazali, Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) singled out interpretations of Qur'anic verse 8: 17 to demonstrate how some Sufis mistakenly read their false beliefs into the Qur'anic text. According to Ibn Taymiyya, it is correct to see in this verse an indication that God is the creator of man and his acts, but false to find in it any sugges- 37. Al-Ghazali, I.hyd', 5: 173-74. 38. The full text of this hadith, often cited in Sufi works is as follows: "My servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks." The translation here is William Chittick's from The Sufi Path of Knowledge (Albany, 1989). According to Chittick, this version of the hadlth can be found in Bukhari, Riqlq, 38.</page><page sequence="13">Mavahib-i Caliyya 481 tion that man's acts are the same as God's acts, or that man's existence is the same as God's existence.39 Although it has been suggested that Ibn Taymiyya's understanding of Sufi ideas in this area was faulty, his critique was nonetheless highly influential, causing a polarization in the Islamic world by Kashifi's time with regards to the works of Ibn al-cArabi and his followers.40 Kashifi clearly sides with the views of Ibn al-cArabi and his followers, quoting the very ideas that Ibn Taymiyya labels as apostasy. He begins his discussion of verse 8: 17 with a translation of the commentary written by CAbd al-Razzaq al-Kashani, one of the most widely read of the early interpreters of Ibn al-cArabi: The writer of the Ta3wtllt said that God showed the companions the way to the annihilation (fandi) of actions by negating their acts as their own and affirming them as His, so you did not kill them, but God killed them. How- ever, when the Prophet was in the state of subsistence (baqdi) in God, his actions were both negated in the words you did not throw and affirmed as his in you threw, and then acknowledged as God's act in but God threw. This is to convey the meaning of differentiation (taftdI) within the source of all- comprehensiveness (cayn al-jamC), for the one who throws is Muhammad, by means of God, not by himself.4l Kashifi follows this with a quote from Ibn al-cArabi himself: The Futuhat Makkiyya says that the Messenger was the secondary cause (sabab) of the throwing, by virtue of, 'I am his hearing and his seeing and his hand....' Therefore, the elimination of the secondary cause in you did not throw concerns only the property (hukm), not the entity (cayn).42 These two quotes are somewhat out of character with the rest of Kashifi's com- mentary because they use the highly specialized vocabulary found in Sufi metaphysical works. However Kashifi continues with a quote from Jami that helps the reader by drawing a comparison between the state of Muhammad and the state of the prophet David: 39.

Sabagh (Cambridge, 1994), 70-11. 41. Kashifi, Mavahib, 2: 9-10.

Kashifi, Mavwhib, 2: 10. Kashifi appears to be translating from section II 552.32 of Ibn al-cArabi's al-Futuihat al-makkiyya (Cairo, 1972-). See Chittick for an English translation of the full passage in his The Sufi Path of Knowledge, 176, and for an analysis of Ibn al-cArabi's use of the terms sabab, hukm, and Cayn, 44 46, 39-41, and 83-88.</page><page sequence="14">482 Sands In the Nafahat al-Uns . . . it is mentioned that, because of the perfection of Mustafa's state, his immersion in the state of annihilation (faniP) was more powerful than that of all of the prophets and saints. When the Messenger was immersed in annihilation in God, God, in His own words, took away the ascription of the act to him, even though the effect (nishanah)43 of it was his, since he said, you did not throw when you threw but God threw.... This kind of act happened with David when He said, David killed Goliath, but there is a difference between the station of Mustafa and the other prophets. There is a big difference between the act ascribed to the servant, who is the locus of calamities and catastrophes, and the act of the servant which He has ascribed to Himself, the Truth, glory be to Him, the eternal, the One who is blameless with regards to calamities and catastrophes.44 Jami is careful here to describe Muhammad's state as unique, but the lines Kashifi quotes next from Rumi's Masnavr seem to suggest that it is a state that can be experi- enced more broadly: You did not throw when you threw, said God. The act of God takes precedence over all acts. If we shoot, the arrow is not from us. The action of the bow and arrow is God's. Until one has been defeated, one has not discovered the secret. If this is what you want, you should hurry to it.45 Whether or not Kashifi was a member of a Sufi order, he was clearly attracted to the more controversial elements of Sufi thought, as presumably were his readers. Kashifi's beliefs with regard to Shicism are harder to assess from the Mavahib. Throughout his commentary, Kashifi refers respectfully to both Sunni and Shici figures and avoids engagement in divisive issues. Kashifi's neutral approach is all the more 43. I believe that Jami here is using the Persian word nishanah as an equivalent to Ibn al- CArabi's use of the Arabic word athar. Ibn al-cArabi uses the terms athar and hukm to describe the phenomena of the universe as they reflect the divine names. See Chittick, The Sufi Path, 39-41. 44. Kashifi, Mavazhib, 2: 10. I have not been able to locate this passage in any of the following editions of Jami's Nafahdt al-uns min hadarat al-quds, ed. M. Tawhidipur (Tehran, 1958); ed. S. De Sacy ( Paris, 1977); (Cairo, 1989); and ed. M. Abidi (Tehran, 1996). 45. Kashifi, Mavaihib, 2: 10. Kashifi appears to be mixing up different verses from the Masnavr on Qur'anic verse 8: 17. The first line quoted here is line 2: 1308 and the second line is 1: 615 in the R. Nicholson edition of the Masnavt (Tehran, 1994) and that of M. Isticlami (Tehran, 1990). The third line does not follow either one of these lines in these editions and is not one I have been able to locate. It is beyond the scope of this paper to address the problems of Kashifi's rather loose citations from Rumi and Jami, although I thank Mohsen Ashtiany, Mohammad Mehdi Khorrami, and Eliza Tasbihi for their help in identifying what I could.</page><page sequence="15">Mavahib-i Caliyya 483 apparent when his commentary is compared to that of Mullah Fath Allah al-Kashani, written more than fifty years later in the Safavid period. Fath Allah al-Kashani used Kashifi's Qur'anic translation and his compilation of interpretations as the starting point for his own commentary. However, one of the ways in which Fath Allah al- Kashani expands on Kashifi's work is by adding material that is distinctly Shici. For example, when Kashifi addresses a verse such as 33:33, he notes the different inter- pretations of the phrase "people of the house" (ahl al-bayt) without stating his own opinion, and his commentary is comparable in this respect to the work of many Sunni exegetes.46 Fath Allah al-Kashani's commentary on this verse, which is at least five times longer than Kashifi's, cites many additional hadrth and versions of hadUth to support the exclusive interpretation of the ahl al-bayt as referring only to Muhammad, cAli, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn, and not to the wives of the Prophet.47 Other than confirming Kashifi's respect for the family of the Prophet, the content of the Maviihib provides little indication of the author's views on Sunni-Shici differ- ences. Kashifi frequently quotes from the important Shici theologians and commenta- tors al-Sharif al-Murtada (d. 436/1044) and Muhammad Abu Jacfar al-Tusi (d. 459 or 460/1066-67), but he does so not for their Shici views, but rather for Qur'anic inter- pretations and comments that he could easily have taken from Sunni exegetical works. It is difficult to determine whether Kashifi's Sunni readers would have recognized these scholars as prominent Shicis, and even if they did, whether this would have con- stituted a reason for dismissing his work. Conclusion The popularity of Kashifi's Mavihib is, I believe, primarily attributable to its style. It combines a very readable translation of the Qur'an with interesting, but not too demanding, tidbits of information regarding the circumstances of revelation and lives of the prophets. The narrative and poetic material that Kashifi includes give his com- mentary a literary quality that is engaging and entertaining. The paucity of Arabic cita- tions in the Maviihib makes it accessible to those readers whose knowledge of Arabic would have been insufficient for them to appreciate a work like Maybudi's Kashf al- asriar. Other than promoting an unapologetic view of Sufism, the Maviahib is a work that avoids controversy. Theological disagreements are mentioned in passing, when they are mentioned at all, and Sunni-Shici divisions are avoided altogether, making Husayn Vaciz-i Kashifi a writer both Sunnis and Shicis attracted to Sufism could claim as their own. 46.
