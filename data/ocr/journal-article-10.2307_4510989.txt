<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XXXIV Recent Literature [53 1963 30. Bird. Lois and Louis Darling, with a foreword by Roger Tory Peterson. 1962. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. xx + 261 pp., lavishly illustrated with black-and-white sketches by the authors. Price $5.00. This book is aimed at the serious amateur who finds some technical background important in his reading about birds, but who makes heavy going of standard general texts on ornithology intended for college classes. Few authors have the light touch neces- sary to pitch the explanation to the proper level, but the Darlings were successful in this ambitious attempt. The sketches contribute heavily not only to the charm of the book but also to the effectiveness of the discussion. The first 42 pages discuss how birds evolved and how the process of evolution continues. Then 66 pages relate to behavior, including the mechanics of migra- tion. The remainder of the book covers the anatomy and physiology of birds in considerable detail, probably more extensively than any other book on birds aimed at non-technical readers. A brief bibliography, aimed at further reading rather than detailed documentation of the text, completes the work.-E. Alex- ander Bergstrom. 31. The Cry of a Bird. Dorothy Yglesias. 1961. E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., New York. 168 pp., ill. Price $4.95. This is the story of the 31 years the author and her sister spent giving refuge and care to sick birds in a fishing village within a few miles of Lands' End and historic Penzance on the storm-battered Cornish coast. It was not a life-work planned, but an occupation enforced on two girls with no previous interest in birds when the first injured jackdaw came their way by accident. Those who have successfully nursed one injured creature usually have others brought to their ministrations. Thus the Yglesias sisters over the years had so many oiled, sick, and wounded birds to claim their attention and help that they apparently neglected their vocations and were consumed by this avocation of aid to sick birds and the accompanying study of avian pathology and behavior. Through their hands and through their hearts over the years passed some 4,000 birds. Dorothy Yglesias writes of them with such great simplicity that the sensi- tive understanding given each bird is very clear. Each was named and is spoken of as an individual, but without anthropomorphism, so that observations on each bird's behavior give one the feeling that a true rapport existed between the Yglesias sisters and their patients. Diagnosis, treatment, and diet are all carefully recorded, as well as the findings of the attending veterinarian. The results of post- mortems performed whenever possible on those birds that did not survive are of particular interest. The Misses Yglesias have given the land in which the Bird Hospital started to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which from time to time had given them financial aid and is now carrying on the work on a permanent hbas,is. -Elizabet,hf S. Austin. 32. Identification for Ringers. 2. The Genus Phylloscopus. Kenneth Williamson. 1962. British Trust for Ornithology, Oxford. 86pp., paperbound, one color plate, 4 photographs, one sketch. Price 7s. Most Americans who have encountered any of these Old-World warblers in the field have come away with a sense of frustration in distinguishing their notoriously obscure plumages, and some appreciation of the problems of definite identification even in the hand. While none of these birds occurs in the Western Hemisphere (except a handful in extreme western Alaska), this field guide is a model for the treatment of a difficult group. As we are finding out in preparating data sheets on nearctic species for the new manual for bird banders, a really good guide to the bird in the hand is not achieved by casual compilation of a few obvious comments. Comments in the technical literature are often scattered; they include many details of no real value to the identification of the bird in the hand, are often based on rather short series of specimens, and occasionally have gaps in such matters as the colors of soft parts. The best work in drawing up material for banders comes to amount to a serious, technical review of the entire group of birds, such as Williamson has produced here. This guide stresses one point of universal value, the range of variation in any measurement or other characteristic. The previous monograph on the genus (by Ticehurst) showed a single value for the wing tail ratio (that is, tail-length ex- pressed as a percentage of wing-length). Williamson found the variation within a species to be too great for such a ratio to be reliable, except for a few species which have the normal range of variation of this ratio listed.-E.
