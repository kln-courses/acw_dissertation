Düring her inspection and mapping of Blue Creek in 1975, Mary Neivans recovered several hundred obsidian flakes from the area of a looted tomb in the building (1991). The south end of the complex is defined by Structure 9, the Temple of the Masks and the focus of this paper. The Architecture of Structure 9 Structure 9 is 10.5 m tall and occupies a central position within the site core. The temple was constructed on its own platform and linked to Plaza A to the west and Plaza B to the north by means of two large causeways or ramps. Structure 9 is con nected to Plaza A by means of a long ramp which slopes down to the large flat open platform located between Structure 9 and Plaza A. The far westem edge of this lower platform has another ramp which connects to Plaza A between Structure 1 and the ballcourt platform. Space is limited on the Structure 9 platform, so it is possible that any large number of people who came to witness activities taking place on Structure 9 would have gathered on this lower platform. This would also account for the ramp to this level being located towards the south-west comer of the platform and not in line with the building's central axis, thereby offering an unimpeded view of the ongoing activities. A large causeway leads to the Structure 13 Courtard en route to Plaza B. This elite residential courtyard was expanded several times until it achieved its final form. This consists of two large masonry structures with corbel vaults resting on large sub-structures (Structures 12 and 13), a wall with a narrow entrance joining the two principal structures, a vaulted room appended into the platform of Structure 13, and a series of three rooms added consecutively onto Structure 12. The last two of these consist of low masonry walls with pole and thatch upper construction. Structure 13 is clearly the focus of the Compound with its main staircase providing access to Plaza B.

The fact that this "flower house" is in the center of a scene where two other temples are shown suggests that this type of house could be of extraordinary significance, and that important ritual activities were taking place within it. According to the Diccionario San Francisco, written in 16th-century Yucatec, a nikteil na is a kind of Council house ("casa de cabildo o donde se junta el pueblo", Michelon 1976:258). The dictionary also providespopol na "mat house" as an alternative expression for such a structure. In the Moran (1935) dictionary of early 17th-century Cholti, the popol otot Fig. 4.

The "smoking flower" sign often appears in the headgear of nobles, especially in Early Classic iconography. The head variant of this sign can occur in both human and zoomorphic form. Here, the entire left head can be interpreted as the anthropomorphic head variant. The depressed area between the heads may once have had an inset motif or object. The band above it is a kind of sky or perhaps an earth band. The single sign in it is an early form of Thompson's (1962) T103, generally accepted having the syl labic value ki. In this context, ki perhaps refers to "heart", "center" (Freidel, Scheie and Parker 1993:74-75). It suggests that the building was not only in the geographical center of the site but was also seen as the place of the axis mundi, the center of the cosmos. The interprétation of the "smoking flower" head in this context can be based on similar iconography on buildings at other Maya sites. We suspect this head represents the god of flowers, or probably simply a personified flower. "Flower houses" are common in Mesoamerica as houses that were used for counsel, the accession places and résidences of kings. The best known example of a "flower house" in the Maya area is certainly House E in the Palace of Palenque. Even though it is called sak nuk nah or "great white house" in hieroglyphic texts, it was decorated all over its white façade with poly chrome flowers (Greene Robertson 1983:12-22). i An iconographie assemblage very similar to the Blue Creek personified flower heads is represented on an incised F'g- Structure 9, photograph of right-side stucco face, cylindrical tripod from Problematical Deposit 50 at Tikal (Culbert 1993:Fig. 128a).

The platform area west of the pyramid could well have served as a dance platform; though this hypothesis will be hard to prove in the ground. There is overwhelming evidence suggesting a Late Classic date for the construction of Structure 9-sub 4c (Guderjan et al. 1994:15-26). The iconography of the stucco masks as well as the discovery of Sierra Red facsimiles suggest that the builders of the structure deliberately tried to emulate stylistic traits of the Early Classic. These archaic traits may reflect the desire of the lords of Blue Creek to give their Community house the same ancestry as some of the larger centers in the vicinity. An old council house would have provided additional légitima tion to the ruling dynasty of Blue Creek. The delibérate archaization of iconography and ceramics is one of the most dramatic and obvious examples of Maya reinterpreting their history. The fact that this reinterpretation occurs during the Late Classic suggests that by that time Blue Creek had gained a certain amount of independence and was in the process of becoming an autonomous local power. The lords of Blue Creek used the device of archaization to date this independ ence back into the Early Classic. When we began research at the Blue Creek Ruin, we set out to investígate the relationships between the site and other Peten sites to the west and Northern Belize sites to the east. Architectural and ceramic data clearly show that Blue Creek was a participant in the Peten sphere with some, but not extensive Northern Belize traits. Its role as a frontier Commu nity has become quite clear. We are interested in the political, economic and royal relationships between Blue Creek and other sites. We also saw Blue Creek as a "daughter site" established in the Late Classic to deal with inter-polity relations. While this may have initially been true in the history of Blue Creek, we now see compelling evidence to believe that Blue Creek quickly achieved independence and was the focal point of its own royal lineage. The presence of a ballcourt and a stela in the Structure 25 Courtyard lend weight to the concept of inde pendence. Other ballcourts are only known from four other sites in northwestern Belize: Quam Hill, Punta de Cacao, La Milpa (Guderjan 1991), Dos Hombres (Houk and Robichaux 1994). Structure 9 offers equally strong evidence in its place ment with Blue Creek and its iconography. If it is apopol nah, a council house, then Blue Creek can only be seen as a fundamentally independent city. Further, while the archaization seen in the masks may well refer back to the royal lineage's origins at another site, it also clearly establishes the royal lineage's authority and independence.

La estructura 9, una de las estructuras más conocidas de Blue Creek, está situada en el centro de la zona arqueológica. Durante la temporada de excavación de 1993, en la fachada de la estructura 9-sub 4c, una fase anterior de construcción de la pirámide, se hallaron máscaras de estuco y en una tomba asociada a ésta se encontró cerámica correspondiente al estilo "Sierra Red" del Clásico Temprano. Como la construcción de la estructura 9-sub 4c seguramente se puede fechar en el Clásico Tardío, los autores suponen que tanto con las máscaras de estuco como con la cerámica que copia un estilo anterior se pretendía crear una impresión semejante al Clásico Temprano. Las máscaras de estuco muestran flores personificadas y con ello caracterizan la estructura como una "casa comunitaria", tal y como han sido halladas con una iconografía comparable en Copán y Palenque. Se supone que Blue Creek incrementó su importancia política a finales del Clásico y que ésta se manifiesta en la estructura 9 y en sus elementos arcaizantes. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Spätklassische Architektur und Ikonographie der archäologischen Zone von Blue Creek, Belize. Struktur 9 ist eine der größten bekannten Strukturen von Blue Creek und liegt im Zentrum der archäologischen Zone. Im Rahmen der Ausgrabungskampagne von 1993 wurden an der Fassade von Struktur 9-sub 4c, einer früheren Bauphase der Pyramide Stuckmasken und in einem damit assoziierten Grab Keramiken im frühklassischen "Sierra Red" -Stil gefunden. Da die Konstruktion von Struktur 9-sub 4c sicher in die Späte Klassik datiert werden kann, vermuten die Autoren, daß sowohl die Stuckmasken als auch die einen frühen Stil kopierenden Keramiken bewußt ein frühklassisches Erscheinungsbild hervorrufen sollten. Die Stuckmasken zeigen personifizierte Blüten und charakterisieren die Struktur daher als "Gemeinschaftshaus", wie sie mit vergleichbarer Ikonographie auch in Copan und Palenque gefunden wurden. Es wird vermutet, daß Blue Creek in der Endklassik an politischer Bedeutung gewann, und daß diese sich in Struktur 9 und den archaisierenden Elementen manifestiert.</page></plain_text>
