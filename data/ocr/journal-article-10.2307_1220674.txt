AUGUST 1982 SMELLIE'S PHILOSOPHY OF NATURAL HISTORY, HARVARD'S BIOLOGY CLASSES AND BIOCAENOSIS* Joseph Ewan** "To differ in opinions with a weak man, is the surest method to offend him: But to canvass, liberally, controverted points with a true philosopher increases mutual esteem." John RotheramI [see notes at end of article] Robbie Burns said of Smellie: "positively of the first abilities and greatest strength of mind, as well as one of the best hearts and keenest wits that I have ever met with.''2 William Smellie, born in Edinburgh in 1740, son of an architect, at age 12 was apprenticed to a printer for six and a half years. At 17 he won a presswork prize for an edition of Terence. He performed so well that he was advanced until, at 25, he operated his own establishment. At 31 he played the major part in the publication of the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1768-1771), contributing several essays to the three volumes.3 Under 'Nicotiana' it is noted that the excessive use of tobacco leads to the "drying up of the brain to a little black lump consisting of mere membranes," and of "Woman" the Encyclopaedia was succinct: "the female of man. See Homo." His interest in natural history had been stimulated by the Edinburgh botanist Dr. John Hope (1725-1786) who greatly admired the lad. Indeed Hope assisted Smellie in setting up his own printing business. Besides the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Smel- lie was involved in the publishing of the Edinburgh Magazine and Review, 1773- 1776, a 4-volume Thesaurus Medicus, an Account of the Society of Antiquaries, a 9-volume translation of Buffon's Natural History, and 9 volumes of that author's Natural History of Birds. An impressive record indeed. While a pupil in Dr. Hope's botany class at the University, Smellie had delivered an essay on the sexes of plants, opposing Linnaeus in his belief, put forth in Spon- salia Plantarum, that "the faculty of generation" in plants may be likened to that in animals, that plants are endowed with a certain degree of animal life, that pollen is a fertilizing agent. Smellie later published in six closely printed pages of the first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1771, his criticism of Linnaean proposition. Smellie denies that plants "spontaneously propel humours" as Dr. Harvey said of animals, or that their phototropic movements are witness of sentient life. "Lin- naeus," says Smellie, "makes the appearance of the pollen adhering to the stigmata of hermaphrodite flowers an ocular demonstration of an actual coitus" (p. 649). "He is not satisfied with attributing life and a generative faculty to plants: He must likewise attempt to prove, that this generative faculty is so strong and vigorous, as to enable them to produce hybrids or mules by means of unnatural commixtures" (p. 649). Smellie found the analogies "entirely without foundation." "Men or phi- losophers can smile at the nonsense and absurdity of such obscene gibberish; but it is easy to guess what effects it may have upon the young and thoughtless." (p. * Revision of paper presented XV International Congress of the History of Science, Edin- burgh, August 1977. ** Dept.

Smellie condensed his earlier arguments for his Philosophy of Natural History (1790). John Rotheram, however, disagreed. Rotheram was the first English pupil of Linnaeus at Uppsala, taking his M.D. degree there in 1775, with his thesis Med- icamenta Purgantia. The same year that Smellie published his Philosophy Rotheram brought out a little-known tract of 43 pages entitled The Sexes of Plants Vindicated. Rotheram of course was proved correct; Smellie wrong. That Rotheram is not no- ticed today may well rest in part with Erasmus Darwin's having published that same year on the "Loves of plants" in a more provocative style! It is William Smellie's Philosophy of Natural History, published in Edinburgh when he was fifty, that interests us here. In 22 wide-ranging chapters he comments on the habits and life cycles of plants and animals, writing in a lively style which even his critics praised. Such topics as the differences between plants and animals, animal behavior, seasonal changes,-"what are the probable intentions of Nature in changing forms"-gre- gariousness, effects of domestication, longevity, and "progressive scale of animals." This Philosophy of Natural History, of 547 pages, provided with a full index is useful in tracing ideas in the history of biology. The unnatural history of the last decade of the 18th century is also noticed without comment. For example, the wolverine (or glutton) who baits a deer by dropping moss in front of the animal, then darts down upon its back, blinding it, then waits for the blinded deer to collide with a tree trunk and kill itself. Smellie names his principal sources from Aristotle to Spallan- zani, and his contemporary Thomas Pennant. Smellie's Philosophy appeared in Philadelphia the year following its publication in Edinburgh, through Robert Campbell, a successful publisher and bookseller.5 Campbell's Catalogue of the year 1796 lists over 1900 items, including Smellie's 9-volume edition of Buffon. The text of this first American edition of the Philosophy, unchanged over Edinburgh, included footnotes by an unidentified commentator. Many botanical names and references were supplied and the mention (p. 79) of a forthcoming American Philosophical Society Memoir on the mammoth of Ohio sug- gests that Campbell had found a knowledgeable accomplice.6 This Campbell edition sold for $2.00. The second American printing of Smellie's Philosophy, a literal re- print also of the first volume only of the Edinburgh edition, was published in Dover, New Hampshire, in 1808, without footnotes. I cannot find that the New Hampshire edition ever became a familiar text. The popular success of Smellie's Philosophy in this country was due to a Boston physician, born the year Smellie died. John Ware,7 was one of thirteen sons, and there were six daughters, of a minister at Hingham, Rev. Henry Ware, who became Hollis Prof. of Theology at Harvard. John Ware took his M.D. at Harvard in 1816, and "by steady devotion to his profession, gradually built up an extensive practice." At 25 he published Medical dissertations on Hemoptysis. Before he became Hersey Prof. of Medicine on the Harvard faculty in 1832, he brought out a drastically altered edition of Smellie's Philosophy. He took pride in eliminating the "Scotticisms." He also indicated on the title page that "various additions and alterations, intended to adapt [the book] to the present state of knowledge" had been made. I agree with Professor Smallwood in his Natural History and the American Mind that Ware "eliminated many of its best features."'8 Ware held the American market for fifty years with thirteen printings and no consequential changes between 1824 and 1874. Thomas Nuttall evidently knew the unchanged 1791 Philadelphia edition, but in 1825 in his classes at Harvard he taught the Ware text since the Ware edition had just reached the local bookstores.9 Thaddeus Harris, professor of natural history at Har- vard from 1837 to 1842, "exercised" his classes with recitations from Ware's edition of Smellie, with "occasional elucidations."10 During this period the botanist Asa Gray heard his freshman recite "Smellie" once a week, although the Ware edition had drastically abridged the botany.11 Where, for example, Smellie had distinguished movement between plants and animals-plants are alive but not sentient-the func- tion of pollen was also omitted. Prof. Gray wrote his wife on March 18, 1842, "I 464 TAXON VOLUME 31</page><page sequence="4">have got my course of recitations for the Freshmen on Smellie well in progress, and am quite interested in it, though at first I thought it would have been a great bore. ... I give them plenty of illustrations, explanations, and ideas not in the book, which pleases and interests them."12 Dr. Ware deleted discussion of human anatomy and body functions. For example, he deleted Smellie's discussion of the "organs of generation" in Man. Smellie had revived the question of the origin of semen which had puzzled Leonardo centuries before, particularly the "power" of the testes in "converting blood" into semen. Ware deleted footnotes and omitted references. He was especially interested in chemistry and his glossary records some of the current nomenclature: ammoniacal gas, carburreted and sulphuretted hydrogen, etc. The original Edinburgh edition of Smellie's Philosophy never did gain acceptance in England. A single British printing of the Ware revision appeared in London in 1842, known from a single copy today.13 There William Paley's Natural Theology, published in 1802 and patterned in many aspects on Smellie's Philosophy, took its place. Darwin was required to pass an examination on Paley at Cambridge and he cited Paley in the Origin.14 Huxley said Paley was the most interesting Sunday reading allowed him as a boy. Hooker wrote to Darwin as late as 1871 that Paley's commentators really might be "a bit worse" than Paley himself. Almost exactly Smellie's contemporary, Paley, wrote with evangelical fervor. He stressed design in a benevolent universe, and was deeply moved by the care bestowed by the Creator on the most trifling feature of an organism. Paley wrote "The marks of design are too strong to be gotten over. Design must have had a designer. That designer must have been a person. That person is God." William Morton Wheeler, Harvard zoologist, has distinguished the naturalist from the biologist: the naturalist, an observer, classifier, describer, "deeply impressed by the overwhelming intricacy of natural phenomena and revelling in their very com- plexity," versus the biologist, a denizen of the laboratory, the experimenter, who delights in capturing phenomena in a net of abstract formulas and laws. The biolo- gist's besetting sin is oversimplification, from the undue isolation of the organisms he studies apart from their natural surroundings.15 Spallanzani was such a 'biologist.' Nearly fifty years ago Wheeler predicted that the sciences, once called natural history, would bid fair to greater development in the future, from the popular desire that has always characterized the naturalist, that he view organisms and their be- havior in their wholeness, in a biome, where ecologic patterns of climate, soils and biota, and adaptation to them are recognized. In 1790 William Smellie, without labelling the concept, elaborated this biocaenosis. That was his bookmark. And his Philosophy of Natural History, even when grossly diluted by John Ware, was to influence the teaching of biology at Harvard in Asa Gray's time and imperceptively in ever widening circles. Chapter XXII of Smellie's Philosophy entitled "Of the progressive scale or chain of beings in the Universe" opens with the paragraph even more pertinent today: "To men of observation and reflection, it is apparent, that all the beings on this earth, whether animals or vegetables, have a mutual connection and a mutual dependence on each other. There is a graduated scale or chain of existence, not a link of which, however seemingly insignificant, could be broken without affecting the whole. Superficial men, or, which is the same thing, men who avoid the trouble of serious thinking, wonder at the design of producing certain insects and reptiles. But they do not consider that the annihilation of any one of these species, though some of them are incovenient, and even noxious to man, would make a blank in Nature, and prove destructive to other species who feed upon them. These, in their turn, would be the cause of destroying other species, and the system of devastation would gradually proceed, till man himself would be extirpated, and leave this earth destitute of all animation." Darwin underlined the last line of the paragraph and wrote in the margin: "islands!!"

However, Zirkle did not mention Rotheram in his Evolution of Biology (N.Y., 1964) co-authored with M. J. Sirks, when discussing the sexuality of plants. Pritzel (no. 7809) confused the father with the son in reporting the latter's vital dates, 1751-1804. 5. Another scarce book: Caspar Wistar's copy at the Amer. Philos. Soc.; Pilsbry copy at Acad.

Terminal advertisement of the 1791 Philadelphia edition announced Cullen's Materia Medica "lately published." That report and the character of the footnotes naming plants and animals, and the citing of arcane authors whose works we know were in the library of Benjamin Smith Barton (1766-1815) identify him. 7. The latest sketch, "John Ware and the Book of Nature," by George E. Gifford, Harvard Med.
