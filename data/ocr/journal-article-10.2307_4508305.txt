MORRIS* Two competing conceptions of contractual obligation dominate mod- ern contract theory. "Neo-classical" scholars characterise contracts primarily as self-imposed, promissory obligations, while "progressive" scholars contend that contracts are primarily state-imposed obligations that have more in common with restitution and tort. Most theorists, located somewhere between these poles, divide the contractual domain into zones of self- and state-imposed obligations but disagree about where to draw the border. This essay considers one of the difficult border areas, the law of impossibility, frustration and mistake, which it will refer to collectively as "excuse". During the nineteenth-century "classical" era of contract law, scholars considered excuse cases to involve self-imposed obligations.' Most courts implicitly still do. But most scholars, whether progressive or neo-classical, now assign excuse cases to the state-dominated zone. This essay maintains that the classical scholars were right, and many judges still are, but for the wrong reasons. This essay places excuse cases on the self-imposed side of the border, but it avoids both the classical era's reliance on implied intent and the current judicial tendency to dodge the question altogether. Instead it portrays excuse cases as unusual applications of practical reasoning,2 particularly in Of Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, Washington, D.C. Mistake generally relates to facts existing at the time a contract is created. Impossibility and frustration involve facts that the parties expect, at the time the contract is created, to be true in the future. (The distinction between a mistake of existing fact and an erroneous prediction can easily dissolve.) In general, a party who seeks to be excused from performing raises impossibility, while a party who seeks to be excused from making payment raises frustration. Treating these three categories as similar in important respects is common. E.g., P.S. Atiyah, An Introduction to the Law of Contract 4th ed. (Oxford 1989), pp. 234-262; A.

(London 1991), p. 822 (the comparison between frustration and mistake "is interesting and sometimes helpful; but it should not be pressed too far"). 2 "Practical reason", a now-renascent concept, is used here in the Aristotelian sense of reasoning that does not amount to deduction or formal entailment but identifies rational relationships among reasons with a view toward action. Most distinctions between practical and other modes of reasoning can be traced at least to foundations laid by Aristotle. See Aristotle, Nichomachean 147</page><page sequence="2">The Cambridge Law Journal the sense of decision-making in the face of conflicts between reasons, by isolating the reasons at work in these cases and identifying the kinds of conflicts between them.3 This approach uncovers an overlooked but definitional element of excuse cases that anchors them in party agreements. Moder theorists classify excuse cases as state-dominated on the assumption that they involve facts that a contract fails to address- that they are "gap" cases. Those theorists also assume that once a court steps away from literal application of a contract, the contract has no further force and the court has no choice but to impose a decision that originates outside of the contract. This essay rejects both assumptions. First it maintains that excuse cases involve, not conventional gaps, but complete contracts that courts recognise cannot be read literally. Second, it maintains that means other than literal application of a contract can extend the contract's reach. This essay makes a descriptive claim, about how courts necessarily decide excuse cases, rather than a normative claim, about how courts should decide them. This descriptive essay will identify the features that are common to all excuse cases and that demarcate them from other cases involving legal obligation. It is a commonplace of modern jurisprudence that identifying what is to count as an instance of one's subject matter is a difficult task in itself. This problem particularly plagues discussion of excuse cases; we will see that writers cannot even agree whether such a category exists. This essay's exercise in analytic isolation will address that problem by establishing that excuse cases constitute an identifiably separate category. This alone can improve related scholarship by enabling, and even compelling, writers who believe they are addressing excuse cases to talk about the same thing. Why does any of this matter? There are several reasons. By isolating the criteria on which courts in excuse cases necessarily rely and tracing them to their sources, this essay will provide ammunition for a fresh assault on the larger question that splits progressive and neo-classical theorists: the philosophical basis of excuse cases. If this essay's claim is correct, it suggests that excuse cases primarily employ distinctly contractual criteria that further party control and support the institu- tion of promising. This suggests in turn that voluntarily-assumed Ethics (Penguin 1953), VI, 2: 1139a26-31.

Law that advances a voluntary practice and fosters private ordering may rest upon a different legitimacy doctrine from that supporting a law that directly remedies harms (though the two might also be conceived as remedying different kinds of harms). In the same vein, law centred on principles of tort and restitution is more amenable to redistributive ends than is law centred on promissory principles, and may require justification on distributive rather than corrective grounds.5 The question taken up here also bears on issues of institu- tional power, such as the different normative warrants involved in applying a contract and imposing a solution. It even casts light on contract law's compatibility with positivism, by isolating the sources of the reasons on which courts act and determining whether they lie inside or outside the contract, and if outside the contract, whether they are matters of social fact (and thus "legal") or of moral reasoning. We can address none of these larger questions before we identify excuse cases more precisely. I. THE THEORIES OF CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY AND THE LANGUAGE OF JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING A. Theories of Contractual Liability: Classical, Progressive and Neo-Classical Since the emergence of contract as a distinct and relatively unified field of law in the middle of the nineteenth century, three major theories of contractual liability have been prominent: the classical, progressive and neo-classical.6 The classical conception reigned relatively unchallenged 4On power-conferring rules, see H.L.A. Hart, The Concept of Law (Oxford 1990), pp. 26-48, 77- 79, 238-240; J. Raz, Practical Reason and Norms, (Princeton 1990), pp. 97-106. For opposing views on whether contract law can or should advance the principles of distributive or corrective justice, and overviews of the related literature, see, e.g., A.T. Kronman, "Contract Law and Distributive Justice" (1980) 89 Yale L.J. 472 (recasting most contract issues as questions of distributive justice); W.N.R. Lucy, "Contract as a Mechanism of Distributive Justice" (1989) O.J.L.S. 132 (arguing that contract law should not and cannot reasonably be used to advance the principles of distributive justice). 6 Professor Atiyah's history of contract law identifies three conceptions of contract that roughly parallel the three schools listed here.

I, pp. 8-39 (addressing separately "Classical Contract Law", "The Decline of Freedom of Contract", and "Return to Classical Principles?").

This conception of contract dovetailed cleanly with classical liberal theory because it maintained that contractual obligation arises, not from the state, but from the deliberate acts of autonomous individuals who impose liability on themselves. The classical conception fell before assaults that this essay will call "progressive". Progressive theories, rejecting the primarily promissory conception of contracts, demote the promise from its role as the contractual engine to a supporting role as mere evidence.8 They conceive of contractual obligations as imposed to remedy losses either resulting from reliance or incurred in bestowing a benefit.9 Consequently, they re-classify much of contract as a subset of tort or restitution.10 This general softening of the classical lines between contract and tort explains works such as the Gibbonesque "Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract" and the Nietzschean "Death of Contract".11 The progressives, of whom Professor Atiyah is a leading example, focus their attack on classical theory's claim about methods of decision-making: that courts decide contract cases by applying party intent. Progressive scholars assign a much diminished role to the intentions of the parties and, particularly in excuse cases, reject the idea that courts can determine what the parties intended.12 They maintain that an excuse case involves a contract that simply does not provide an answer, so that the law must impose one from sources Contract (Oxford 1979).

Contract as Promise 151 external to the contract based on principles that are not distinctively contractual.'3 Because this means that excuse cases cannot be distin- guished from instances of tort-like or restitutional obligations, it moves excuse cases (along with much of contract law) to the state-dominated side of the border. 14 In opposition to the progressive theories, many scholars champion a refined version of classical contract theory, which this essay will call "neo-classical". Professor Fried has developed perhaps the most prominent theoretical elaboration, although some variation of it is implicit in most leading treatises.15 Neo-classical scholars still insist that the most important parts of contract law centre on promises, but they concede that the classical reliance on "intent" as the basis of all contract-based decision-making was over-ambitious.'6 In particular, the neo-classicists agree with progressives that "implied" intent is a fiction. They also assume that obligations formerly believed to rest on implied intent have no alternative grounding in party agreements.'7 Because of this assumption, the neo-classicists concur in the progres- sives' elimination of excuse cases as a species of the genus contract. Even Professor Fried makes this concession. He maintains, first, that excuse cases fall in contractual gaps where the "will of the parties" has run out so that, second, they must be decided by reference to "non- voluntary principles" that are "external" to the contract.'8 On both counts, this essay will disagree with him. 13 See discussion in P.S. Atiyah, Introduction to the Law of Contract, op. cit., at pp. 254-257; A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts (St. Paul 1960) § 1331 pp. 355-361 (maintaining that judges who purport to formulate implied terms that parties "would have made" had they known the later facts are actually imposing a term based on the requirements of justice: "Justice is more likely to be done if the court is conscious that it is filling a gap that the parties have left and uses language in its opinion that is not language of interpretation only;" see citations therein). For an early foreshadowing of this position, see W. Page, "The Development of the Doctrine of Impossibility of Performance" (1920) 18 Mich. L. Rev. 589, 605-609 (rejecting the fiction of implied condition as causing "confusion of thought"). '4 For a typical statement of this now well-wor thesis, see, e.g., G. Gilmore, op. cit. n. 2, passim, esp. p. 87 ("'contract' is being reabsorbed into the mainstream of 'tort"'). 5 See C. Fried, Contract as Promise. (Harvard 1981). The related literature is substantial. For a more condensed defence of contract law as distinct from tort and centred on the enforcement of voluntary undertakings, see J. Raz, "Promises in Morality and Law" (1982) 95 Harv. L. Rev. 916. A leading example of a consistently neo-classical treatise is G. Treitel, The Law of Contract, op. cit. n. 1. 16 See, e.g., Treitel, op. cit. n. 1, pp. 2, 149-160 (on the limitations of objective interpretation of intent); Fried, op. cit. n. 15, pp. 60-62, maintaining that once a case cannot be decided by subjective intent it must be decided by "non-contractual principles." Fried does, however, concede the existence of a weaker sense of intention to which courts can give expression in unforeseen situations: ibid. at pp. 87-88. His statements about the limits of the effect of intent and the promissory principle, however, indicate that he does not extend the reach of the parties' voluntary assumption of obligations as far as this essay does.

Bases of Judicial Decision-Making: Implied Intent, Equity, and Construction General theories of contractual obligation are efforts to make sense of masses of data in the form of reported cases. Excuse cases need considerable interpretation because they do not contain language that immediately reveals their theoretical underpinnings. Instead these cases employ the language of common-law reasoning and decision- making; an example is the invocation by judges of "implied intent" that classical theorists believed supported their theory. Based on the terminology that they use, the cases divide into three loose groups, each reflecting a different approach to decision-making: implied intent, "justice" or "equity", and contract "construction".'9 These categories are of only limited value. Because they simply adopt terminology used for different purposes, they do not identify separate modes of analysis or methods of reasoning, nor do they even provide commensurable explanations of the cases. Implication of "intent" is a decision-making technique; "justice" or equity is a justification that does not explain the reasoning used; and "construc- tion" either is an undeveloped reference to a technique or an undevel- oped assertion about the basis of a decision. Many scholars have tried to reconcile the cases based on the language used, but apparently none has succeeded. Some have simply thrown up their hands and catalogued the most commonly-used language.20 This essay will not attempt to reconcile the cases, but it will try to explain them. The following analysis of the reasoning process in excuse cases will help us take the language of the cases seriously by suggesting that references to different justifications or techniques do not necessarily conflict with each other but may be slightly inaccurate references to successive steps of the reasoning process (see Section II. D. 3., below). Although these three groupings do not themselves amount to theories of contractual obligation, each has features that give it significant points of contact with one of those three theories. Take decisions based on "implied intent". Because each such decision purports to rely directly on a contract, it corresponds to some form of the classical theory. Examples include the seminal Taylor v. Caldwell and Krell v. Henry, in which judges conform excuse cases to the classical 19 Some variation of these classifications can be found in any leading textbook. Professor Treitel, for example, lists five "juristic bas[e]s" of frustration cases as "implied term", "just solution", "foundation of the contract" (as Treitel points out, this quickly merges into implied intent or construction), "construction", and "failure of consideration" (which seems similar to "construction"). Treitel, op. cit. n. 1, pp. 818-821. 20 See, e.g., Treitel, op. cit. n. 1, pp. 818-821; Lord Wilberforce in National Carriers v. Panalpina (Northern) Ltd. [1981] A.C. 675, 693 (the "[v]arious theories... shade into one another"); Lord Simon of Glaisdale, ibid. p. 702 ("a number of theories have been advanced to clothe the doctrine of frustration in juristic respectability").

In its place courts adopt one of two replacements: the "equity" approach, which has strong but minority support, and the "construction" approach, which apparently commands a majority.23 According to the "equity" or "justice" approach, the discharge of the contract occurs not by act of the parties, but by operation of law because the court creates "a special exception which justice demands".24 This reference to "justice" does not provide much information about the basis of the decision, however; it indicates only that the basis lies outside the contract. This of course lends support to a form of progressive theory. In National Carriers Ltd. v. Panalpina (Northern) Ltd, Lord Wilberforce hints at this link with the broader shift away from classical contract theory: "the movement of the law of contract is away from a rigid theory of autonomy towards the ... imposition-by the courts of just solutions".25 The third category is that of contract "construction". This aligns with some form of neo-classical theory (although not with Fried's particular theory, which characterises excuse cases as based on equity- like principles). A decision that appeals to "construction" purportedly draws its decision-making criteria solely from a contract, but does not rely on implied intent. The problem is that, while "construction" purports to avoid the discredited implied intent, it apparently replaces it with nothing, and amounts only to an unsupported assertion that a decision is in some way grounded in the contract. Consider the discussion in McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission.26 There the High Court of Australia recasts the common law of mistake as a 2) Krell v. Henry [1903] 2 K.B. 740, 748 (discussing impossibility in terms of an "implied condition" in a contract); Taylor v.

Ltd. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co. Ltd [1916] 2 A.C. 397, 403 (court should infer existence of a term if both parties assumed a fact when bargaining). 22 Cases from the classical era are frequently ambiguous as between subjective and objective intent, although they generally moved from the former to the latter; which one a court uses is not important to this essay. 23 A typical, and much quoted, criticism of implied intent can be found in Davis Contractors Ltd. v. Fareham Urban District Council [1956] A.C. 696, 728 where Lord Radcliffe said that invocation of the objective version of the theory of the implied term amounts to "no more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice". See also Lord Denning in Ocean Tramp Tankers Corp. v. VIO Sorfracht (The Eugenia) [1964] 2 Q.B. 226, 238 ("But the theory of an implied term has now been discarded by everyone, or nearly everyone, for the simple reason that it does not represent the truth"). 24 Hirji Mulji v.

How or whether "construction" refines earlier references to implied intent is not clear; as more than one court has noted, "construction" means no more than saying "What, in fact, was the true meaning of the contract?"27 As Professor Treitel points out, "[c]onstruing the contract and implying a term are... only alternative ways of describing the same process".28 To some extent, the apparent split between these three groups is irreconcilable. Not only are the groups incommensurable in the sense that each uses language for a different purpose, but even cases in any one group do not use language consistently. Moreover, some courts divide as to the bases of their decisions,29 some simply recite the various bases without choosing between them,30 and others even cite inconsistent bases without awareness of the apparent contradiction.31 Consequently this three-part grouping of the cases is of only limited explanatory value. One should not, however, disregard entirely the language used by the courts. At the least, it can indicate whether a court believes it is basing a decision inside or outside the contract at issue. The predomi- nance of the language of construction, for instance, indicates that most courts-unlike most theorists-still see excuse cases as based inside contracts, while the persistent use of the language of equity indicates that some courts, including perhaps the House of Lords, see them as based outside contracts. Paradoxically, however, these opposing views of excuse cases can lead to the same erroneous conclusion: that no independent doctrine of excuse exists. The "equity" approach maintains that excuse cases are like any other obligation imposed for reasons arising outside a contract and therefore do not constitute a category distinct from restitution or tort. On the other hand, adherents of the "construction" approach often maintain that there is no independent category of 27 F.A. Tamplin Steamship Co. Ltd v. Anglo-Mexican Products Co. Ltd [1916] 2 A.C. 397, 404 (also quoted by Lord Hailsham in National Carriers Lid. v. Panalpina (Northern) Ltd. [1981] A.C. 675, 688). 28 G.

This erroneous conclusion, reached independently from each of two opposing premises, underlines the confusion that surrounds this area. Part II will try to correct these errors by explaining that excuse cases have distinctive features that distinguish them from both conventional contract and state-imposed obligations: that they require more than conventional contract application but do not require resort to extra- contractual principles such as equity. Excuse cases are instances of a more complex chain of reasoning in which party agreements exert gravitational pull even after direct intent has run out.32 II. A Court in an Excuse Case does not Confront an Unaccounted for Case; Rather it Alters an Apparently Complete Contract A. Excuse Cases Do Not Have Conventional Gaps Both modern theories hold that, when intent runs out, a contract has no further force; as a result the resolution of any related disputes must be based on criteria external to the contract. But this binary view draws an unnecessarily sharp distinction between contractual and non- contractual criteria and overlooks an important intermediate zone that bridges the two. This zone creates a continuum of decision- making criteria graded according to the degree to which they are internal or external to the contract and maintains continuity between the application of a contract and the imposition of a solution. At one end are decision-making reasons provided entirely by the parties. In particular this includes plain language that uncontroversially controls the set of facts to which it is applied. At the other end are reasons that stem entirely from sources outside of the contract. In the broad middle are decision-making criteria that are based on the contract but require more activity by the decision-maker than the mere direct application of contractual terms. Excuse cases are generally determined by reasons that lie in this broad middle range, beyond the direct application of intent but still inclined toward the party-oriented pole. This means that these cases are decided, in varying degrees, by rational extension of the agreement reached by the parties. These For discussions of how a case that is not entirely determined by a rule may nonetheless be partially determined by legal sources see N. MacCormick, Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory (Oxford 1979), pp. 100-195; J. Raz, The Authority of Law: Essays on Law and Morality (Oxford 1979), p. 70 ("a legal gap exists if some legal questions have no complete answer") (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="10">The Cambridge Law Journal reasons are not matters of "intent" in the classical sense, but a check for intent does not exhaust the force of a contract. As Professor Raz maintains, in specific rebuttal of both Atiyah and Fried, "the normative consequences of a promise are only in part the effectuation of the expressed intention of the promisor".33 The binary conception leads to the idea of isomorphic contractual "gaps". A gap opens up, writers assume, when a contract fails to provide a complete answer in a case so that a decision-maker must refer to sources external to the contract to reach a decision.34 It is true that contracts often have large gaps, although the borders of those gaps are not as sharp as the binary view suggests. But the flaw in gap theory at issue here is its failure to distinguish between two very different reasons for referring to criteria beyond the plain words of a contract.35 The more common type of gap case arises from the failure of the parties to include a needed term in a contract. An obvious example is the absence of a price in a contract for sale of goods. (Such a gap can be filled by any of a number of legal sources, for example, by a statute requiring that a "reasonable" price be paid.)36 Why these are called "gap" cases is obvious. Contrary to the assumptions of many modern writers, however, a gap in this sense does not exist in an excuse case. The problem is not that the contract does not provide a complete answer, but that the answer that the contract provides seems in some sense wrong. Fried, for example, overlooks this distinction in his argument that an excuse case is a kind of"accident" because it is unanticipated by the parties.37 In fact, "accident" is a word with a long pedigree in practical reasoning, and earlier usage captures the distinction that Fried overlooks. Aquinas's influential discussion uses "accident" to refer not to unaccounted-for cases but, as in this essay, to refer to cases that are within a rule's scope but for some reason should be excepted from its force.38 Fried's assumption that excuse cases are unaccounted-for cases leads him to skip over the step that distinguishes excuse from other contract cases: the very removal of an excuse case from the class of 33 J. Raz, "Promises in Morality and Law" (1982) 95 Harv. L. Rev. 916, 932. 4 A typical use of "gap" in the contract setting is Atiyah's. See P.S. Atiyah, "Book Review" (of Contract as Promise) (1981) 95 Harv. L.

The critical point is that the criterion for recognising an excuse case-the contract's purpose-originates in the contract itself. Already we see that a conception of reasoning more complex than the binary one is needed to account for decision-making involving apparently complete contracts. B. An Excuse Case Involves Conflict Between Two Kinds of Internal Reasons, Not an Appeal to External Reasons We have just seen that excuse cases involve decisions that seem wrong for reasons based in a contract. This essay will call these "internal" reasons to distinguish them from "external" reasons, which arise outside a contract. Excuse cases arise only when the reasons that defeat a complete contract are internal; cases in which the reasons that defeat a contract are external do not display the internal conflict (between contractual language and purpose) that marks excuse cases. Consider an apparently complete contract that conflicts with standards that are external to it, such as usury laws. In such a case a court simply acknowledges the superior legal rank of the external standards- that certain statutes automatically trump conflicting contracts-and declines to enforce the contract. No excuse-type problem arises. Notice that external sources that defeat complete contracts play a role different from that of external sources that fill true gaps. In a true gap case, no conflict arises (so no part of the contract is overridden). Instead, the contract "runs out" and the decision-maker turns to external sources to fill the gaps. We now return to the contract that is complete but dictates a decision that appears to be "wrong" for internal reasons. This happens when a court senses that the plain application of a contract's terms would dictate a decision contrary to the contract's purpose. Such a court looks through the contract's words to ascertain the point behind the contract, compares that point with the decision dictated by the words, and decides the case according to the point rather than the words. This is a complex process because the court is relying on the words and overriding them at the same time. It relies on the words, probably together with other information about the parties or the context, to discern the background purpose or "practical point" of the contract.39 At the same time it overrides the words' direct application in order to serve the point just derived from them.40 What is crucial is 39 This use of "practical point" draws on John Finnis's use of the concept in Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford 1980), pp. 6-9. 40 See Ronald Dworkin's discussion of the "real" rule, statute, or poem that lies behind a text. R. Dworkin, Law's Empire (Harvard 1986), pp. 16-17. This essay similarly seeks a point behind a contract, but in a manner that is much more constrained than Dworkin's. First, where Dworkin's C.L.J. 157</page><page sequence="12">158 The Cambridge Law Journal [1997] that the court is drawing on the contract itself, and not reasons external to it, to overrule the contract's literal application.41 It is this two-step exercise in practical reasoning that is the hallmark of excuse cases; recognising it permits us to address these cases as separate from other cases involving legal obligations. This dependence on the contract itself as the source of the criterion of wrongness marks the leading cases in each ofthe three excuse areas. In Taylor v. Caldwell,42 the first prominent impossibility case, the defendant was excused from providing a music hall for the use of the plaintiff and from reimbursing him for wasted expenses. There was no true gap in the contract because there was no question what the plain words of the contract required: the music hall owner must provide a hall or pay damages. The contract provided no exception or release in case of destruction of the hall, nor was there any sign that the contract was unconscionable or violated another norm external to it. Nonetheless the court looked past the words of the contract to its apparent background purpose. It decided that although the words dictated that the defendant perform in this situation, performance did not serve the contract's purpose, and it created an exception to the words. Similar is Krell v. Henry43 the first prominent frustration case, which involved the hire of a flat for the viewing of King Edward VII's later-postponed coronation procession. Again the words of the contract provided a complete decision: the defendant hirer must pay the plaintiff owner. The contract provided no exception for postponement ofthe procession. Again the court relied on the apparent point ofthe contract to move the case from the category "resolved by direct application of contract language" to the category "frustration". We see the same pattern in mistake cases. In Associated Japanese Bank v. Credit du Nord,44 a guarantee was void for mistake where the identification of the "real rule" is normatively saturated, ibid. pp. 176-275, this essay's method is evaluative but not necessarily normative. Second, where Dworkin's process permits justification by analogy to virtually any value found in a legal system, ibid, this essay's process binds courts to a fairly low level of abstraction based on the content ofthe contract and the cases the contract must continue to cover. 41 Courts may apply a reasonable person standard to determine how to decide the case in light of the point of the parties' agreement, but that still amounts to extending the reach of the party's agreement rather than imposing an external solution. (Anson's Law of Contract disagrees, maintaining that the use here of a reasonableness standard only serves as a mask for the court's creating an exception that justice demands: A.G. Guest (ed.), Anson's Law of Contract, 25th ed., (Oxford 1979), p. 507.) But just as application of an objective standard for intent in contract law will correspond in most case to the parties' actual subjective intent (contra, progressive scholars cited above) the use here of reasonableness assumptions should generally approximate the manner in which the parties would have resolved the issue in light ofthe practical point of the agreement. Disagreement on this point lies near the heart of the conflict between classical or neo-classical scholars and contract-as-tori scholars. 42 (1863)3 B. &amp;S. 826. 43 [1903] 2 K.B. 740. 44 [1989]!

Brymer,45 a contract for hire of a room for viewing the same coronation procession that was in issue in Krell v. Henry was void for mistake because the procession had already been postponed at the time the contract was made. Neither decision needs conventional gap- filling information, and neither suggests that the contract at issue violated rules or standards external to it. Similar is Sherwood v. Walker,46 the ground-breaking American mistake case. The contract for the celebrated cow "Rose 2d of Aberlone" violated no standards external to the contract; again the "mistake" conclusion can be based only on the court's understanding of the contract's background purpose. In each case, whether the court identified the contract's point correctly is contestable-the difficulty generally is in assessing the role of risk-shifting in the contract-but one cannot deny that ascertainment of a purpose is a necessary step in the court's reasoning. One can argue that the contestability of the statement of purpose could render the distinction between correct and incorrect meaningless in practice, but that does not collapse the distinction at the conceptual level. (This essay addresses that argument in Section II. E. below, where it maintains that other elements of the decision-making process substantially constrain the ascertainment of purpose.) This essay has set out the distinction between internal and external reasons for decision, as well as the reliance of excuse cases on internal reasons. It now attempts to understand further the apparently paradoxical use of party agreements in excuse cases and to identify more carefully the degree to which the criteria of decision in such cases arise inside or outside the contract. It will draw to a great degree on the scholarship of rule-following, which has developed this distinction in depth. Section II. C. briefly sketches the parallel between contract- application and rule-application. C. The Identification of Over-Inclusive Rules Parallels the Identification of Excuse Cases Like a contract, a rule is an attempt to use words (or other conventions) to bind a person or persons in the future.47 Like a contract, a rule has 45 (1903) 19 T.L.R. 434. 46 66 Mich. 568, 33 N.W. 919 (1887). 47 This is far from an original comparison. See e.g., R.S. Summers, Statutes and Contracts as Founts of Formal Reasoning, in P. Cane and J. Stapleton (eds.), Essaysfor Patrick Atiyah (Oxford 1991), ch. 4. Professor Schauer, author of Playing by the Rules (Oxford 1991), might at some point reject the rule/contract parallel. He states (at p. 18) that, because the idea of generality is essential to the concept of a rule, "lu]niess we mean to describe for multiple instances or prescribe for multiple actions it is simply mistaken to use the word 'rule"'. A contract is like a rule for the purposes of this essay, however, in a useful way. It is general in the sense that it is expected to dictate a reason for a particular outcome in a variety of possible situations. Also like a rule, a contract suffers the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of an attempt to control in the present a decision to be made by another person in the future. See ibid., ch. 7 ("The Reasons for Rules"). See also discussion in 159 C.L.J.</page><page sequence="14">160 The Cambridge Law Journal [1997] a background purpose or practical point. In Frederick Schauer's useful nomenclature, this is a rule's "background justification".48 Like a contract, a rule is a device created to allocate power in two ways: first, between persons, to the rule-maker (or the contracting parties) and away from the later decision-maker; second, over time, toward the time when the rule (or contract) is created and away from the time when a decision-maker applies it. In achieving this allocation of power, rules have well-known limitations, which are the founts of Niagaras of literature and are closely associated, beginning with Aristotle, with the need for practical rather than formal reasoning in rule- application.49 First, it is a commonplace that humans cannot foresee all factual contexts to which rules they adopt will apply. Equally important, even if humans could anticipate all possibilities they would not complicate rules or contracts to account for every one of them, because every exception creates added costs. Hence every rule or contract draws a line at some level of probability beyond which it does not continue to anticipate and account for possible events. Compounding these weaknesses are the limitations of language. Because words correspond to abstract and pre-existing categories, they can be incompatible with the context-relative nature of drafters' goals. In most contexts, the words selected to constitute a rule will advance its purpose, but at their edges or in unusual contexts they may dictate outcomes to the contrary. Rule appliers can identify instances of over- inclusive rules only by ascertaining (however unconsciously) a rule's background justification and comparing the decision it dictates with the decision dictated by direct application of the rule's words. This comparison of literal scope with substantive purpose mirrors the critical step that courts necessarily take in excuse cases. We can press this internal/external distinction harder in an effort to answer two questions. First, is the distinction theoretically coherent? Section D maintains that it is. Second, does it survive in practice, or can a court simply posit a background purpose suitable to its desired decision and in that way re-introduce criteria external to the contract? Section E argues that the distinction holds good in practice because P. Atiyah and R. Summers, Form and Substance in Anglo-American Law (Oxford 1991), p. 71 (a rule is "a norm which applies to a class of cases"); W. Twining and D. Meiers, How To Do Things With Rules: A Primer of Interpretation 3rd ed., (London 1991), pp. 9-30 (reviewing the functions of Rules). 1 Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, p. 53.

Meiers, op. cit. n. 47, pp. 40-44, 211-216. See Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics (Penguin 1953), V.x. 1137b ("So when the law states a general rule, and a case arises under this that is exceptional, then it is right, where the legislator owing to the generality of his language has erred in not covering that case, to correct the omission by a ruling such as the legislator himself . . . would have enacted if he had been aware of the circumstances.").</page><page sequence="15">Contract as Promise a court's identification of background purpose is substantially con- strained by the content of the contract. D. A Court that Classifies a Case as an Excuse Case Necessarily Relies on Internal Reasons as Decision-Making Criteria 1. Excuse cases involve two-step practical reasoning in which internal reasons provided by the second step defeat internal reasons provided by the first We first examine this essay's crucial distinction more closely. What is the difference between defeating the language of a rule or contract on the basis of its own background purpose and defeating it on the basis of some other criterion? In the context of rule application, Professor Schauer calls this distinction between sources internal and external to the contract the distinction between internal and external defeas- ibility.50 Internal defeasibility is the overriding of the plain application of a rule based on reasons originating in the rule itself. As we have seen, that reason generally is the decision-maker's understanding of the background purpose or point of the rule.5' To the extent that excuse cases are instances of internal defeasibility they are extensions of reasons derived from the acts of the parties. They do not require decision-makers to question the substance of the contract or to look outside it (other than to context) for guidance. External defeasibility differs in that its reasons originate outside the rule and its justification.52 As we also have seen, they generally comprise other legal rules or principles that exist independent of the contract at issue and defeat it without regard to its background purpose. We can now list the kinds of reasons identified so far and plot their rankings in excuse cases. As Professor Raz points out, different kinds of reasons have different statuses in a decision-making process and, as a result, lead to different kinds of conflicts between reasons.53 This identification of the relative statuses of various internal and external reasons should clarify our understanding of the bases on which various reasons at work in a contract case can defeat each other. We will see that the status of each reason stems first from its source and only secondarily from its content. To begin with, there are the two kinds of internal, contract-based reasons: first, reasons to apply a contract literally, and second, reasons to defeat the literal application in favour of advancing the contract's background purpose. Because both are the same kind of reasons- 50 Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, p. 117. 51 Ibid. 52 Ibid. S3 See J. Raz, Practical Reason and Norms (Princeton 1990), pp. 15-84, 178-199. C.L.J. 161</page><page sequence="16">The Cambridge Law Journal internal, or contract-based-conflicts between them are resolved by weighing the two directly against each other and deciding which should prevail. Each can prevail over the other only on the basis of its substantive merits. Literal application prevails in most cases, but background purpose prevails in excuse cases. Two kinds of external reasons also can come into play in contract cases. We can think of the first kind as "default" rules and principles (although it includes other types of rules and principles) and the second kind as "immutable" rules and principles.54 Only the second surfaces in what can appear to be excuse cases. Each of the two kinds has a different status relative to internal reasons. Default rules and principles come into play only when a true contractual gap needs to be filled. Hence they rank below and must give way to all existing and identifiable internal reasons. It is this formal hierarchical superiority of contract-based reasons to the first kind of external reason that distinguishes contract law from tort and restitution. The internal reasons carry the day over the default kind of external reason because of status-because they are contract- based-and not because they produce outcomes that are in some way better.55 Internal reasons are more than additional reasons or information to be weighed, on a par with other reasons or information; they are special reasons that because of their formal status need not even compete with the first kind of external reason. In short, they prevail because of their kind rather than because of their weight. So internal reasons play two roles: they provide positive reasons to make a certain decision, and they act as "exclusionary reasons" by excluding consideration of the default kind of external reason.56 As a result of this exclusionary function, the resulting decision purports only to be the right answer based on the contract rather than the right answer on the balance of all legal reasons. As we will see, the scope of their exclusionary power is limited: they do not generally exclude consideration of the second kind of external reason, immutable rules and principles. 54 "Immutable" rules and principles cannot be altered by agreement. For an overview of the literature addressing the differences between the two kinds of rules, see lan Ayres and R. Gertner, "Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts: An Economic Theory of Default Rules" (1989) 99 Yale L.J. 87, 87-91. 55 In this way contract-based reasons act as what Professor Raz calls "second-order" reasons that by their superior status defeat "first-order" reasons. For an explanation of second-order reasons and their relationship to other types of reasons, see Raz, Practical Reason and Norms, op. cit. n. 53, pp. 15-84. 56 See Raz, Practical Reason and Norms, op. cit. n. 53, pp. 39-45. In rule-making one of the benefits of exclusionary reasons is efficiency: the conserving of decisional resources by saving the decision- maker the need to reconsider all factors that might be relevant to reaching a decision. Cf. Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, § 7.3 ("The Argument from Efficiency"). In the contract context efficiency is one reason for this exclusionary function, but the primary purpose is power allocation: the contracting parties intend to determine ex ante which reasons a court can consider in applying the contract. Cf Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, § 7.6 ("Rules and the Allocation of Power"). 162 [1997]</page><page sequence="17">Contract as Promise 2. Cases that rely on "justice" are not "excuse" cases but involve a third step, in which a certain kind of external reason overrides internal ones Now for the relationship between internal reasons and immutable external ones. Internal reasons cannot generally defeat the immutable kind of external reason. Immutable rules and principles, which override any conflicting contractual provisions, set the boundaries of the freedom to contract. Immutable reasons divide into two sub-groups. The first sub-group comprises statutes or legal rules that contracts may not violate; this sub-group defeats conflicting contract-based reasons solely on formal grounds due to superior rank. This sub-group includes statutes that simply forbid certain contracts, such as prostitution and usury laws, and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. A second sub-group is a bit more complex in application: it comprises principles that have force that varies across cases, and that at some point can defeat complete contracts. These principles cannot trump contract-based reasons based solely on status, however, but compete with them on substantive appeal. Some of these principles play different roles at different times. They are default principles in certain situations, coming into play only to fill gaps, but in other situations they rise to the status of immutable principles, coming into play even against complete contracts. These include substantive legal principles such as "fairness" and "unconscion- ability". In a case decided on the basis of "unconscionability", for example, a court looks outside the contract for standards of fairness, overrides what it considers an unfair contract, and chooses the answer that is most fair considering all permissible legal reasons. This clarifies what a court does when it invokes "justice" in what may be mistaken for, but is not, a contractual excuse case. Such a court is always referring to criteria of substantive fairness outside the contract and overriding the outcome dictated by the contract. It is returning to the reasoning process first identified in Section II. B. above, the defeat of a contract based on external reasons. In this way a court that decides what it considers to be an excuse case by invoking "justice" is generally adding a third step to the two-step internally- based reasoning process that characterises excuse cases. Because that third step is the conventional application of fairness principles, it does not involve any feature unique to excuse cases and it removes such a case from the excuse category. 3. Courts have failed to identify the natures of and the relationships between the steps of the reasoning process that distinguishes excuse cases One should not overstate the sharpness of the conceptual distinctions drawn here. This essay does not deny that continuity exists between C.L.J. 163</page><page sequence="18">164 The Cambridge Law Journal [1997] interpretation of a contract and imposition of a fair outcome; Section II. E. addresses this continuity further. This continuity does not elide the distinction between the two functions, yet it does help to explain why courts do not always identify whether they are practising interpretation or imposition. It is no surprise, then, that the labels that courts attach to their reasoning often fail to identify the distinctions between direct application of a contract's terms, reliance on a contract's purpose to override its terms, and resort to principles external to a contract. Some courts have acknowledged that the reasoning process involves two or three distinct steps: something beyond the single-step application of a contract, yet connected to the contract in a way that decisions based on external reasons are not. Signs of this idea are evident as early as Bell v. Lever Bros. Ltd, in which Lord Atkin seems to identify the search for contractual intent and the application of the doctrine of mistake as distinct and consecutive steps.57 More recent cases have come closer to articulating the two-step internal-reasons paradox. The Super Servant Two emphasises that the first and most important step is the construction ofthe contract, and that only if that fails to resolve the matter does the question of excuse arise.58 The Super Servant Two does not go on, however, to separate the concepts of mistake and of the flexible principles of equity.59 Associated Japanese Bank v. Credit du Nord roughs out a three- step structure, with the last step an extra-contractual appeal to equity.60 There Steyn J. identifies, first, reasoning based directly on the contract;61 second, "common-law mistake", or reasoning based on the contract but differing in some way from its direct application62 and still separate from and prior to consideration of principles of equity;63 and third, reasoning based outside the contract, on principles of equity rather than of common law.64 Although Steyn J. does not explain what the second step involves, he does separate contract-based or internal criteria from external criteria by correctly using "equity" as a signal that he has reached the third, extra-contractual, step of the reasoning process. 57 [1932] A.C. 161, 226-227. Lord Atkin then, however, collapsed them into one inquiry. 58 The Super Servant Two [1990] 1 Lloyd's L.R. I, 8. 59 Ibid. 60 Associated Japanese Bank turned on the first step and discussion of the second and third was obiter: [1989] 1 W.L.R. 269-270. 61 At p. 268 ("Logically, before one can turn to the rules as to mistake . . . one must first determine whether the contract itself. . . provides who bears the risk ofthe relevant mistake"). 62 At p. 268 ("Only if the contract is silent on the [risk-allocationj point, is there scope for invoking mistake"). 63 At pp. 267-268 (referring to a limited common-law doctrine of mistake "supplemented by the more flexible doctrine of mistake in equity"). 64 [1989] 1 W.L.R. at p. 268 (explaining that "if the contract is held to be valid [after considering the common-law doctrine of mistake], a plea of mistake in equity may still have to be considered") (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="19">Contract as Promise Similarly, when Lord Denning in Solle v. Butcher attempts to expand the scope of equitable jurisdiction to include certain questions of excuse, he locates the application of equity principles as subsequent to the question of common-law excuse. He notes that, where a contract is not void based on common-law mistake, a court nonetheless can set it aside for reasons of justice.65 This identification of "justice" (representing principles formally permissible only in courts of equity) as a step distinct from and subsequent to the excuse analysis illustrates the conclusion reached in Section II. D.2. that reliance upon "justice" constitutes the use of non-contractual reasons in a way that is not unique to excuse cases. This helps to explain the otherwise confusing references to "justice" or similar principles in these contract cases.66 Courts that refer to justice generally have passed through the two contract-based reasoning steps that characterise excuse cases without finding a basis for excuse, then have resorted to principles of equity (and to their equitable jurisdiction67). We should categorise these as more akin to traditional "equity" cases than to "excuse" cases. (Some confusion may persist in the cases because common-law courts traditionally could not apply principles of equity.)68 In this way this essay's characterisation of excuse cases takes seriously the language of many of the cases by clarifying that they are to a degree reconcilable: the "construction" cases tend to lean more heavily on contract-based reasons than do the "equity" cases. By contrast the characterisation of excuse cases as uniformly resting on external criteria simply rejects most of the cases-the "construction" cases-as wrong. Failure to grasp the nature of the second step-drawing on a contract's purpose to override its text-leads to the argument that there is no independent concept of "excuse" at all because such cases are matters of construction and hence are indistinguishable from all cases controlled by contracts.69 Failure to grasp the nature of the third 65 [1950] I K.B. 671, 692. 66 See G. Treitel, The Law of Contract, op. cit. n. 1, pp. 284-285.

E. The Process of Identifying Excuse Cases Substantially Constrains Identification of the Contract's "Point" The keystone of the internal/external distinction, as well as its weakest point in application, is the ascertainment of a contract's background justification or purpose. That step introduces substantial opportunity for error. We have seen that a court that considers declining to apply the literal terms of a contract necessarily makes an inference about the background purpose of the contract because the court needs some basis for its sense that the decision is not right. Hence a court confronting an excuse case cannot say, as it can in a true gap case, that the contract provides no guidance as to how to decide that case. (The most difficult decision generally is whether the practical point of the contract involves risk-shifting.) This raises the question whether, in practice, intelligible limits exist on the range of background purposes that a court can attribute to a contract. It may seem that courts are able to evade any limits by simply referring generally to "significant changes in circumstances", then proceeding to permit a defence of excuse.70 In fact, however, a court's articulation of a contract's background purpose is substantially constrained by the very act of recognition of an excuse case. A judge cannot simply posit any background purpose that supports a desired outcome, but must articulate a background purpose in a way that also preserves the contract's application to the easy cases directly covered by its words. That is, the court must create an exception that makes sense in the context of all of the fact-sets to which the contract uncontroversially applies, as well as to the fact-set being adjudicated. We can identify two separate constraints on the court's ability to modify a contract. First, it can alter the contract's application only in the direction of narrowing its application, thus preserving its application which prevents the contract from coming into operation, or if offer and acceptance on their true interpretation are found to be divergent"). 70 Typical characterisations include "such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing undertaken would ... be a different thing from that contracted for": Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co. v. John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. [1977] 1 W.L.R. 164, 173 (quoting Denny, Mott &amp; Dickson Ltd. v. James B. Fraser &amp; Co. Ltd. [1944] A.C. 265, 274-275, 279). See also The Super Servant Two [1990] Lloyd's L.R., p. 8 ("significant change in circumstances") (citing Hirji Mulji v. Cheong Yue S.S. Co. Ltd. [1926] A.C. 497, 510); National Carriers v. Panalpina (Northern) Ltd. [1981] A.C. 675, 700 ("significantly change[d] in nature"); Associated Japanese Bank v. Credit du Nord [1989] 1 W.L.R. 255, 265 (quoting the "radical change in obligation" test). Bell v. Lever Bros. even raised the Platonic question whether the quality of the thing contracted for was "essentially different" from what the parties believed it to be: [1932] A.C. 161, p. 218 (H.L.). 166 [1997]</page><page sequence="21">Contract as Promise to uncontroversial cases. Assume that a contract provides that occurrences of the fact-set a,b,c,d,e dictate decision X. A court deciding an excuse case may decide that the contract makes sense only if fact z is also present, even though the parties did not include z in the factual predicate. (Perhaps the probability of the non-occurrence of z was too low for the parties to incorporate it into their agreement.) A court can narrow the contract so that it applies only if z is present by adding to the contract's factual predicate so that it reads: a, b, c, d, e and z.71 In Taylor v. Caldwell, z is the continued existence of the music hall; in Krell v. Henry it is the occurrence of the coronation; in Associate Japanese Bank v. Credit du Nord it is the existence of the leased equipment. The court that adds z to the factual predicate creates a contract that produces the desired result in the case at hand. But here we see the second constraint. The court cannot amend the factual predicate with whatever facts it likes; it cannot affect the contract's continued application to other cases. To ensure that the court has drawn on the contract for its reasoning-has grounded the addition of z in a fairly stated "point" to the contract-the court must articulate a justification for z that makes sense in relation to the continued application of a, b, c, d, e to non-controversial cases. This tethers the court to a low level of abstraction when stating the purpose of the contract. The need to justify a rational relationship between the exception and the continuing application of the rule will exclude many attractive options (such as nullifying the entire contract on fairness grounds). It also points up the difference between an excuse case and the defeat of a contract based on external reasons, such as unconscionability: in the latter cases those reasons generally excuse performance even on the contract's core facts. This largely dissolves the apparent paradox of appeal to a contract to create an exception to the contract. The court can decide the immediate case only in a way that acknowledges and is limited by the contract's continuing gravitational force. Up to the point where that gravitational force runs out, the court preserves the decision's distinctly contractual nature and the hierarchical superiority of contract-based reasons for decision.72 71 The method discussed here parallels Professor Raz's discussion of the common-law technique of distinguishing in J. Raz, The Authority of Law: Essays on Law and Morality (Oxford 1990), pp. 183-189. 72 At times Charles Fried appears to soften the apparent dichotomy, discussed above, between what this essay calls internal and external reasons: "Since actual intent is (by hypothesis) missing, a court respects the autonomy of the parties so far as possible by construing an allocation of burdens and benefits that reasonable persons would have made in this kind of arrangement. (It treats the contract as a kind of charter or constitution for the parties' relation)": C. Fried, op. cit. n. 15, p. 73. Fried then reaffirms the dichotomy, however, by stating that this necessarily requires reference to external sources. ("This is ... an inquiry with unavoidably normative elements."): ibid.. C.L.J. 167</page><page sequence="22">168 The Cambridge Law Journal [1997] This qualification again brings into view the limits on this essay's thesis: application of a contract is continuous with imposition of a result. This essay maintains that courts in excuse cases generally apply contracts rather than create them and that these two functions are generally distinct, but it also concedes that they are continuous. For instance, the considerations at work in the two overlap: what outcome most parties would consider fair is relevant to both application and imposition though, it is important to note, for different reasons. This means that at some point contract interpretation blends into contract creation. It helps explain the court's frequent reluctance not to specify exactly what role a consideration plays in a case and why. It also helps to explain the views of many theorists that there is no difference between interpretation and creation. All of this is to explain some of the fog that surrounds excuse cases but not to retreat from the main point; the application/imposition continuum helps to trace the border around this essay's thesis but does not refute its account of the focal features of excuse cases.73 In the law of excuse the functions of contract interpretation and creation remain on the whole distinct in concept and in practice. F. In the Interest ofStability, Courts Limit the Defeating of Literal Application to the More Egregious Cases Understanding the decision-making process in excuse cases raises yet another fear: that courts, newly aware of their power to decide cases based directly on background purpose, will frequently ignore the literal terms of contracts. We can allay these fears by reviewing the reasons a court has to refrain from using this new power in all but the most extreme cases. A court determining when a contract's words dictate a decision contrary to the contract's background purpose must make an "at some point" decision, a dichotomous cut in a continuous spectrum of fact-sets, all but one hypothetical, to which the contract might apply. It must decide at what point the fact-set is such that application of the contract would be contrary to its purpose. For instance, in Taylor v. Caldwell many other situations could have arisen in which the music hall owner would have wished to avoid the contract. He might have received an offer of more money for the same period, the staff might have gone on strike, or the building might have suffered relatively reparable damage. It seems likely that none of these would have sufficed to relieve him of his contractual duty, but a court could not be sure until it performed the excuse analysis. 73 On "selection of central case and focal meaning", see J. Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford 1980), pp. 9-11. See also Joseph Raz, Practical Reason and Norms. op. cit. n. 53, p. 150; H.L.A. Hart, "Definition and Theory in Jurisprudence" (1954) 70 L.Q.R. 37, 46.</page><page sequence="23">Contract as Promise Yet a court cannot override a contract's literal application every time the background purpose suggests a different outcome. Deciding when to do so involves a complex set of factors. A court generally considers not only whether it will reach the correct outcome in this case, but also systemic factors, particularly the effect of such a decision on the entire practice of contract-making. Even in a case where a court has reason to override a contract's literal application the better to achieve the contract's substantive background justification, the effect on the practice of contracting will provide reasons-not necessarily winning ones in any particular case-weighing against override. A look at similar problems in rule-application is again enlightening. Recall that Professor Schauer calls the substantive point of a rule its "substantive justification". He refers to the reason a person chooses the device of a rule as a means to achieve the substantive point as the "rule-generating justification".74 This can be thought of as the benefits of the practice of rule-making or, in our case, of contract-making. A court confronting an excuse defence must consider not only whether it gets the right answer in this case (correctly advances this contract's "substantive justification" or background purpose) but also the effect on rule-generating justifications: the systemic effect of a successful excuse defence on the practice of contract-making. Overriding or defeating a contract's literal words can harm the practice of contract-making, generally by diminishing predictability of application. It also introduces the possibility of judicial error or manipulation in making the interpretive move from the words to the justification. As discussed above, this evaluative step creates some play in the process and can dilute the power of the contract drafters in favour of the contract applier. The possibility of error also encourages parties to expend added drafting costs by lengthening their contracts to cover more contingencies and thus avoid having any contract- related disputes treated as excuse cases. Other costs stem from the resulting increase in the number of cases litigated and the increased complexity of each case. Parties will contest cases that, if the excuse concept did not exist, courts would quickly decide by the literal application of a contract. This added step also requires courts to pause in each case to consider whether it may be an excuse case; absent the excuse concept the courts could simply apply the words of the contract and draw greater benefit from the tendency of rules to economise decision-making resources. This inquiry increases the costs of deciding cases, although it taxes a court's time less than would a complete review of the fairness of each contract.75 74 Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, § 5.4 ("Two Types of Justification"). 7 This review for egregious cases taxes a court's time less than would a complete fairness review because review of a case for extreme characteristics demands significantly fewer decisional C.L.J. 169</page><page sequence="24">The Cambridge Law Journal The risks that excuse cases raise help to explain the common law's traditional hostility to excuse, apparent as early as the unflinching Paradine v. Jane in 1647.76 These risks also help to explain why even modern cases that do not question the vitality of excuse doctrines refuse to find excuse in what appear to be appealing cases (Bell v. Lever Bros., for example77) and continually reinforce the strict limits on these narrow doctrines.78 We also can obtain some sense of the significance of these systemic considerations by comparing British and American law and legal practices. It is generally accepted that the American law of excuse is more liberal than its British counterpart.79 This is consistent with American tendencies in judicial decision-making: to employ less formal and more content-based reasoning methods, and to give less force to precedent and to the systemic effects of particular decisions.80 It is also consistent with the relatively lesser prestige of contractual neo- classicism in the United States (even American neo-classicism is weaker, illustrated by Fried's rejection of a contract-based account of excuse cases), as well as with the weaker status of legal doctrine and of the traditional doctrinal treatise.81 It may also help to explain the conventional belief that Americans tend to more complex contracts and to higher rates of litigation.82 The systemic reasons addressed here are reasons, based on protec- tion of general contract practice, against finding excuses in contract cases. They do not always outweigh reasons to find an excuse, but their degree of force gives contracts some "stickiness" or resistance to being overridden even when literal application seems counter to the resources than does reconsideration of all relevant factors in every case. Schauer seems to agree. See, e.g., Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, pp. 89-91, 230 (on taking a "perfunctory glimpse" at legal outcome, to see if it is an "extreme or dramatic" case and therefore an "obvious" case for override of that outcome). 76 Aleyn 26. 77 [1932] A.C. 161 (H.L.). 78 See, e.g., The Super Servant Two [1990] 1 Lloyd's L.R. 1, holding that, under this contract, events arising due to negligence or unreasonable conduct of defendants could not be the basis for a defence of frustration. 79 See, e.g., G. Treitel, op. cit. n. 1, p. 275. 80 See, e.g., the extensive discussion in P. Atiyah and R. Summers, Form and Substance in Anglo- American Law (Oxford 1991), passim, esp. pp. 88-93, 418-419. 81 A recent exception, reflecting both neo-classical tendencies and a belief in the treatise, is Farnsworth. See R. Barnett, "Contract Scholarship and the Re-emergence of Legal Philosophy" (1984) 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1223 (reviewing Farnsworth's treatise). For a general discussion of the history and current state of the treatise, and of its relationship to doctrine, see A.W.B. Simpson, "The Rise and Fall of the Legal Treatise: Legal Principles and the Forms of Legal Literature" (1981) 48 U. Chicago L. Rev. 632. The treatise tradition remains strong in England, where there is a relative abundance of excellent contract law treatises. What is more, these treatises tend toward a neo-classical, or doctrinal, view. In the United States, by contrast, Farsworth probably is the first major treatise since Corbin and, except for the first Restatement, the first neo-classical or classical work since Williston. 82 See, e.g., P.S. Atiyah, "Tort Law and the Alternatives: Some Anglo-American Comparisons" (1987) Duke L.J. 1002, 1004-1016 (discussing the relative litigiousness of the United Kingdom and the United States).

But these two types of factors-correctness of individual outcome and systemic consideration-do not always conflict; sometimes they point in the same direction. Finding an excuse in a case of most extreme egregiousness, for instance, not only advances the contract's substantive justification by making it the basis of the decision, it also strengthens the practice of contract-making by reinforcing the expectation that courts will decline to apply them in certain unusual cases.8 To the degree that courts limit their finding of mistake to the most unusual cases, future contracting parties will have less fear that courts will alter contracts at the point of application. In most cases, however, interest in the health of the practice of contracting generates pressure for courts to minimise "excuse" cases by making decisions according to the literal contract terms and accepting sub-optimal results in particular cases. If courts were to treat contracts as transparent, deciding every case by looking past a contract's words and directly to its background purpose, the practice of contracting would lose much of its predictability.85 But even such continuous revisability, it is important to note, would not introduce external reasons for decision or destroy the primarily contract-based nature of mistake cases. G. This Method does not Resurrect "Implied Intent"; It Relies on the Effectiveness of Some Formal Features of Law and on a Flexible, Non-Sceptical View of Legal Reasoning Although this essay seeks to restore an understanding of excuse cases as to a degree extending the effect of the parties' agreement, it does not seek to re-establish the classical era's use of "intent". It would be inaccurate, according to most uses of "intent", to say that excuse cases apply the parties' real, although in some way "implied", intent. At any rate it would be a pointless linguistic diversion to analyse the word "intent" more completely in the hope of determining whether a court's reason for decision can be fairly placed under that heading. Presumed intent (like implied conditions) may be a product of what is commonly called the formalist thinking of the classical contract 83 For this use of"stickiness" or what Schauer generally calls "ruleness", see Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, p. 82. 84 The court believed it faced such a case in Aluminum Co. of America v. Essex Grp., 499 F. Supp. 53, 89 (W.D. Pa. 1980): "If the law refused an appropriate remedy when a prudently drafted long- term contract goes badly awry ... [p]rudent business people would avoid using this sensible business tool". 85 Cf. Schauer, op. cit. n. 47, p. 95 ("direct application of the substantive justification ... would engender excess uncertainty"). C.L.J. 171</page><page sequence="26">172 The Cambridge Law Journal [1997] era: the idea that legal reasoning is deductive, categorical and a close cousin of mathematical reasoning.86 The ascendancy of this idea corresponded with a tendency to suppress signs of indeterminacy in the application of the law and fed the assumption that contracts (like whole legal systems) should be gapless.87 Hence, that theory went, a contract must control all contingencies through the deductive applica- tion of its terms.88 Reasoning from conclusion to major premise, this indicated that whenever a court resolved a contract dispute it must be applying the intent of the parties, and led to the view of mistake cases as determined by implied intent. But this essay has demonstrated that a contract can have force for reasons other than the traditional use of "intent". Here that force flows from a combination of the contract itself and of reasoning techniques both sufficiently autonomous and sufficiently cabined to provide decisions that can be criticised and challenged. In fact, a summary look at changing conceptions of legal reasoning, from the classical through the realist to the modern era, will further buttress this essay's claim that courts decide excuse cases based on distinctly contractual criteria. The tidy classical view of legal reasoning disappeared, replaced in realist and progressive circles by a picture of legal reasoning as largely content-based, especially in a political sense, but with a specialised vocabulary.89 Consistent with this change, progressive scholars rejected the elegant classical model of contract in favour of the more wide- open conception of obligations imposed by the state. Ironically, pro- gressive scholars followed classical scholars in holding legal reasoning 86 This harsh view of "formalist" reasoning in the classical era is probably somewhat overdrawn. For recent general discussions of formalism, see, e.g., F. Schauer, "Formalism" (1988) 97 Yale L.J. 509, 510, 535-538; E. Weinrib, "Legal Formalism: on the Immanent Rationality of Law" (1988) 97 Yale L.J. 949. To avoid confusion, I must point out that this essay also attempts to identify certain "formal" features of legal reasoning, "formal" in the sense that they are derived from legally authoritative sources. It distinguishes them from content-oriented or "substantive" reasons, which are the moral, economic or political consequences of application. See, e.g., Atiyah and Summers, op. cit. n. 79, pp. 1-31 (drawing the distinction and proposing, in addition to the word "formalist", a corresponding word "substantivist"). See discussion in R. Summers, "The Formal Character of Law" [1992] 51 C.L.J. 242. Professor Raz draws a similar distinction between "content-independent" reasoning based on formally authoritative sources and "content- dependent", or substantive, reasoning. See, e.g., J. Raz, "Legal Rights" (1984) 4 O.J.L.S. 1, 5-15. 87 Illustrating the era's high regard for deductive, formal reasoning is Henry Sidgwick's The Methods of Ethics (London 1874), in which he criticised practitioners of more casuistic and practical ethical reasoning as "hopelessly loose" (as compared to mathematicians) in their definitions and axioms (from a letter included in the preface to the sixth edition, 1901). That is not to deny that some courts probably were aware that they were employing fictions in order to fit their opinions to this form of reasoning. 88 Charles Fried effectively disarms this idea by explaining that even if one believes that a legal system as a whole cannot have gaps, no similar problem arises with contract law because it is only a part of the law and any gaps can be filled by other legal sources. C. Fried, op. cit. n. 15, pp. 67-69. 89 This position is most prominently associated with American "legal realists". For an overview of legal realism, see S.A. Purcell, J., The Crisis of Democratic Theor, (Kentucky 1973), pp. 74-94; W. Twining, Karl Llewellyn and the Realist Movement (U. of Oklahoma 1973), pp. 3-83, 375- 387.</page><page sequence="27">C.L.J. Contract as Promise 173 to excessively high standards, according to which it is either deductively valid or wholly indeterminate. It is no accident that for both of these schools, as soon as the plain words of a contract run out, the law has no methods for deciding a dispute other than the resort to external "policy". (It is also not surprising that a strong correlation exists between one's views of contract law and of legal reasoning. Those who are more inclined to see contract as dead tend also to doubt the existence of methods of legal reasoning that are distinct from political reasoning.)90 This is why H.L.A. Hart calls legal realists "disappointed absolut- ist[s]".91 Tending to assume that legal answers are not justifiable if they are not formally valid, they are also unable to accept, as constraining and legally forceful, the evaluative distinction between literal and warranted application that is essential to excuse cases.92 Although they are correct that in an excuse case a court does not directly apply the intent of the parties (and hence the court is not deciding the case deductively), non sequitur that the court is left with no basis for its decision other than sources external to the contract. The law routinely relies on methods of reasoning that are more flexible than the classical contract era accepted, yet are more determinate than the progressives believe. This essay illustrates at least one application of legal reasoning that is not deductive but nonetheless provides reasons that are identifiable, that have some force, that bear rational relationships to one another, and that are decidedly legal in character. Unlike the classical and the progressive, the neo-classical account of contract law should be compatible with a view of legal reasoning as practical reason, able to accommodate the distinctions central to this essay while remaining distinct from political reasoning. Neo-classicists who exclude excuse cases from the party-oriented sphere, however, seem to overlook the claim made in this essay and accept the consequences of the progressive's general view of legal reasoning. Again Charles Fried is an example. His acceptance of the progressive account of excuse cases is inconsistent with his view of contract as * See, e.g., P.S. Atiyah, "Book Review" (of Contract as Promise) (1981) 95 Harv. L. Rev. 509, 509 ("increasing doubts are felt about the neutrality of the judicial process in the interpretation and enforcement of contracts, and hence there is greater belief that the enforcement of contracts depends ultimately on collectively imposed value choices"). For prominent statements by critical legal scholars of the progressive dismissal of legal reasoning, see R. Unger, The Critical Legal Studies Movement (Harvard 1983), pp. 8-11; M. Tushnet, "Following the Rules Laid Down: A Critique of Interpretation and Neutral Principles" (1983) 96 Harv. L. Rev. 781, 818-819. H.L.A. Hart, The Concept ofLaw (Oxford 1990), p. 135. In fact, however, the idea of limiting application of a rule to the cases in which it is warranted is a familiar principle of legal interpretation. It is captured in the familiar cessante ratione, cessat ipsa lex, or "when the reason of or for a law ceases, so does the law itself." A more formal reasoning style, however, relies less on this maxim in determining the scope of application of a rule and relies more on the literal language of the rule.</page><page sequence="28">174 The Cambridge Law Journal [1997] doctrinally distinct from tort and of legal reasoning as flexible but nonetheless distinguishable from policy.93 Impossibility, frustration and mistake decisions are grounded in the consent ofthe parties and based on principles that are distinctively contractual. The "gaps" to which most theories of contract consign these cases are not gaps at all but are, upon close inspection, a second step in a decision-making process in which a court draws on the contract itself to create an exception to the contract's literal terms. Hence excuse cases are distinctively contractual in their dependence on a kind of source-based validity: the validity of the legal answer stems from its source in the parties' agreement rather than from a source elsewhere in the legal system. In this way evaluative techniques of legal reasoning extend the force of the parties' choices to resolve even cases turning on contractual excuse. Neo-classical theorists can reclaim excuse cases for the sphere of party-oriented, voluntary obligations. 1 See C. Fried, "The Artificial Reason of the Law or: What Lawyers Know" (1981) 60 Texas L.
