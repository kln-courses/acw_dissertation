Meaning and Scientific Status of Causality BY HENRY MARGENAU HE disagreement with regard to the validity of the principle of causality, existing to-day among scientists, has its roots in the diversity of defi- nitions of the principle itself rather than in a 'problematic scientific situation. As far as the formulation of quantum theory is complete its bearing upon philosophical questions can be fixed with precision provided the questions are phrased intelligibly. But a question is intelligible from a scientific point of view only if it satisfies two conditions: (I) the meaning of its terms must be fixed; (2) it must be in accord with the conventions of the science to which the question is put. The necessity of the first requirement is at once evident; if it were not satisfied the question would have several correct but self- conflicting answers, such as those to which the undisciplined dis- cussion of philosophical problems usually leads. The second requirement, however, reflects a particular weakness of philoso- phy. Within the domain of the latter, words have retained a variability of meaning which, to be sure, makes for beauty and flexibility of expression, but impairs precision of speech. So per- I33</page><page sequence="2">I34 Causality sistent was the tendency toward figurative flourish that even in cases where science had standardized the meaning of a term in a very systematic and useful way philosophers continued to use the term with its former diffuseness. When accused of this pro- cedure they said they were speaking non-technically and deplored politely the scientist's manner of degrading terms into technical ones. Indeed the difference between philosophy and the special- ized sciences began when the latter caused their concepts to crystallize and agreed to name them universally and with care. Even now the distinction between science and philosophy is best described in saying that science proceeds by making the accept- ance of its terms obligatory for all its pursuants, while philosophy allows its advocates to coin largely their own phraseology. This individualism frequently causes confusion and indefiniteness of philosophical attitude. To illustrate: whether causality is a category or not, is chiefly a matter of definition and nomenclature and may be answered correctly by yes and no, in fact the question may be meaningless; proponents for each of these three answers are to be found among modern philosophers. However, the question: is mercury an element has but one correct answer. Similarly, the term energy which has a perfectly definite scientific meaning is constantly used in phrases such as "mental energy" which signifies nothing unless ignorance of the laws of physics on the part of the speaker. Science has avoided such ambiguities. Hence we can effectively guard against them by using technical lingo wherever it is possible. In discussing causality it is neces- sary to formulate the problem in terms of physics as far as they are available. Considerations like these are common with all scientists and many philosophers to-day; they constitute no unsympathetic critique of philosophy, or of the methods employed in philosophical investigations. For the solution of numerous problems the methods of science, which, speaking figuratively, is nothing but the crystallized part of philosophy, are not, or at least not yet, at hand. It is also true that the philosophical terminology is more strongly subjectedito popular misuse than scientific language, and therefore prevented from being standardized. None of these</page><page sequence="3">H. Margenau 135 arguments is sufficient, however, to justify the use of vague philo- phical phrases where definite scientific terms present themselves. Kant's formulations of the causality principle are to be rejected mainly for these reasons. When he says in the first edition of his "Critique of Pure Reason:" "Alles, was geschieht (anhebt zu sein), setzt etwas voraus, worauf es nach einer Regel folgt," this statement is not scientifically clear. "Regel" is entirely unde- fined; it is possible to find a rule for everything that is susceptible of description. On the other hand, if the word is to be interpreted as a means of knowing subsequent events in advance, there arises the difficulty of who is to know and employ the rule, together with all the other inconsistencies which will be encountered shortly in connection with similar formulations. Another pos- sibility of interpretation places the emphasis upon the first part of the sentence and neglects the last as an inessential explanatory phrase. But then, if "voraussetzen" is taken in its temporal sense, Kant's statement amounts to nothing more than the asser- tion that the universe has no beginning in time, which is plainly not identical with the causality postulate. Kant's modified formulation, as it appeared in the second edi- tion of the same book, reads: "Alle Veranderungen geschehen nach dem Gesetz der Verkniipfung von Ursache und Wirkung," and is subject to the same criticism. Physics knows of no such law; as a matter of fact there is no plausible way of defining cause and effect. No laws of physics, if properly stated, involve ref- erence to either of these concepts, and if the distinction of cause and effect is artificially impressed upon the phenomena which these laws regulate, then the laws do not even allow us to differentiate between the two. This fact follows at once from the well known property of reversibility possessed by all natural laws. Newton's law of gravitation, for instance, sets up a rela- tion between an observation on the rate of change of the radial velocity between two masses on the one hand, and the distance between them on the other. But it contains no criterion to de- termine the causal status of these observations. There is no law of connection between cause and effect known to science; moreover, these concepts are foreign to physical analysis. Nor</page><page sequence="4">136 Causality is it of any avail to inject them externally, for the meaning usually conveyed by the words in question is expressed more adequately and precisely by technical terms like boundary condition, initial and final state. Most of the difficulties discussed so far are avoided in Laplace's statement of what he and many later scientists consider to be the essence of causality. He postulates the existence of a universal formula according to which all happenings take place, and ex- presses this state of affairs as follows (Theorie analytique des probabilites): "An intelligence knowing, at a given instant of time, all forces acting in nature, as well as the momentary posi- tions of all things of which the universe consists, would be able to comprehend the motions of the largest bodies of the world and those of the smallest atoms in one single formula, provided it were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it, nothing would be uncertain, both future and past would be present before its eyes." This is certainly an intelligible proposition; it is excellent in its clarity and precision. All of its terms are well defined; the word force is to be understood in its accurate physical sense as the product of mass and acceleration, and "knowledge of a force" means knowledge of the differential equation which relates this product to a function of position, this function being also known. This spirit of Laplace's propositon pervades all of classical physics and has been eminently fruitful in the develop- ment of that science. Is the proposition true? In answering this question we shall find reason for abandoning this particular formulation of the causality principle. Of course Laplace's statement is true. Imagine if possible a perfectly arbitrary universe with a god agitating it according to his ever-changing desires. Although we are still searching for a suitable definition of causality, it seems clear that this would constitute the model of a non-causal world. If we further sup- pose the happenings in this chaotic universe to be discernible and describable, then it must be possible also to represent them by means of equations. These equations will not necessarily contain analytic functions only, nor will they be differentiable. However, if things take place with reasonable smoothness and not too sud-</page><page sequence="5">H. Margenau I37 denly, if "natura non facit saltus," the functions will possess the property of differentiability. It is then clear that differentiation will, in general, simplify the equations, for it will cause additive constants to diasappear. An intelligence powerful enough to know all these differential equations together with the values of coordinates and derivatives at a given time, and able to solve them, would have a complete survey of all events, future and past. In Laplace's world this survey must be possible on the basis of a knowledge of all forces, i.e. differential equations of the second order. This, in itself, constitutes no further restriction upon our arbitrary universe, since there is nothing to prevent us from dif- ferentiating the equations twice; but it expresses a preference which should manifest itself in a universe satisfying this particu- lar causality postulate. In such a world laws should take on an especially simple form if they are stated as second order differential equations. Thus it is seen that Laplace's postulate is not a strin- gent one, it is true for almost any imaginable universe. It im- poses nothing upon a world which by itself runs smoothly, and is certainly a valid approximation to the course of events in the arbitrary, non-causal universe. In that sense the statement in question is true, but it does not seem to characterize causality. Whether or not nature is conveniently describable in terms of second order differential equations is an entirely different issue and must probably be affirmed-although there are cases of physi- cal analysis where description by equations of higher order is customary. The fact that the postulation of a universal formula, as phrased by Laplace, involves the hypothetical existence of an omniscient demon has been considered unsatisfactory by numerous investi- gators. An excellent critique of this point is to be found in Ph. Frank's recent book: Das Kausalgesetz und seine Grenzen. The appeal to a higher intelligence is certainly unscientific and to be avoided if possible. But it is not intrinsically bad if it merely serves to clarify the proposition. The question is: does La- place's supposition of a superior intelligence constitute an essen- tial point of his statement? Evidently not, for if the reference to this intelligence were omitted the assertion, weak as it may be,</page><page sequence="6">138 Causality that nature be conveniently describable in terms of second order differential equations would still remain. But this can be pro- gressively tested by experience and admits of definite verification. Hence it is not legitimate to say that the demon does not exist or is impossible and therefore reject the proposition. A real criti- cism should attack its meat and not its form. It may well be observed in this connection that a very common argument against causality fails for the same reason. This argument appeals to the uncertainty principle which does not permit all the simultaneous data necessary to integrate the universal formula to be known. Hence, it is concluded, the causality principle can not be valid. Here, too, it is forgotten that the criticism is directed against an inessential point in Laplace's formulation which, as we have seen, fails to express the characteristics of a causal universe anyway. The differential equations governing the processes in the arbi- trary, lawless world which has been imagined will in general in- volve the time explicitly. Consequently the forces (which are always to be defined in terms of accelerations, not popularly as "pushes and pulls") will change with time in an essential manner, and not only through the co6rdinates on which they depend. In order to predict the future Laplace's demon would have to know not only the instantaneous values of all forces, he would require their complete form as functions of the space co6rdinates and of time. An entirely different situation arises if we postulate that the forces be functions of space co6rdinates and possibly their time derivatives only. This would constitute a very definite limitation upon natural processes, a limitation indeed which the world agitated by a god would fail to exhibit. For now the forces have the same instantaneous values whenever the co6rdinates and their derivatives assume a given set of values; this endows nature with a regularity which, it appears to us, is very nearly what causality is meant to convey. But this important feature hardly follows from Laplace's formulation and may, at any rate, be expressed more directly as we shall see presently. Before continuing this trend of thought it seems necessary to deal with a definition of causality which is most widely accepted at present. The argument runs: introducing a superior intelli-</page><page sequence="7">H. Margenau I39 gence is not permissible because it is man who makes his science and it must be he who is to judge whether his world is causal or not. A universal formula without an individual knowing it is a vague phrase. Why not modify the proposition last considered by substituting man in place of the demon? The causality prin- ciple is then valid if it is possible for the scientist, on the basis of known laws, to reconstruct the past and to project the future when the present state of the world is completely known. We shall term this conception of causality, in which a clearly anthro- pomorphic attitude combines with utilitarian considerations, the positivistic one for want of a better name. It is quite in harmony with the modern trend of eliminating things that have merely logical status but no concrete meaning in terms of physical opera- tions. Nevertheless it pays to examine it closely. First it is defective from the point of view of intelligibility. The term "possible for the scientists," or, if it is preferred, "pos- sible for the human mind" is objectionable. If it conveys its popular connotation, who is to decide the capabilities of the scientist or the human mind? Even though a present physical theory denies the possibility of knowing all data upon which a detailed analysis of the future depends, this possibility may be restored by later developments. It is true that this fault can be remedied by modifying the positivistic formulation of the causality principle and stating: causality exists if no confirmed physical theory contradicts the acquisition of data by which a determina- tion of future and past events can be made. However, this is very specific and has never been proposed, nor is it exempt from the criticism that follows. In line with the present argument we also note the occurrence of words like "law" and "theory" which, though they figure prominently in physical discussions, still lack universal definitions and are very far from being technical terms. Direct statements about nature are always clearer and less involved than terms like these which refer to our reasoning about nature, and are therefore better suited to define causality. If such con- siderations seem pedantic one must answer that their neglect has caused more difficulties than has the actual solution of philo- sophical problems.</page><page sequence="8">1 40 Causality Yet they do not touch the principal weakness of the positivistic causality formulation. We propose to show that the latter may be satisfied by a non-causal universe. The point is simply this: causality has nothing to do with the question whether future events may be known in advance, its prerequisite is not that the scientist turn prophet. Suppose that the god who agitates his universe according to his inscrutable desires and without restric- tions by law or order should give the scientist exact forewarnings of his actions, so that the latter is able to prophesy with accuracy. Would this make his playland a causal universe? Of course there is no rigid answer since we are still searching for a suitable definition of causality. But if we interpret correctly the universal implication of this concept regardless of its various formulations we feel that one must answer: no. It is commonly conceived, for instance, that the occurrence of miracles contradicts causal- ity; in fact disbelief in miracles is usually justified by the causal constitution of the world. The circumstance that many mir- acles have allegedly been predicted is hardly sufficient to restore a sceptic's belief in them, and hence to reconcile their occurrence with the causality postulate. We conclude: the positivistic form- ulation with its main emphasis upon human ability to know in advance does not express the nucleus of what is understood by causality. Besides, it is anthropomorphic and reflects distinctly the present utilitarian color of our science. Let us now put an end to criticism and select a definition that will satisfy the outlined requirements more widely and state the central part of the concept in question. It will be granted that the crucial feature which makes the arbitrary world non-causal is the irregularity arising from the whims of the god, whether this irregularity may be known or not. To be more specific it is the fact that in a non-causal world the force between two electric charges varies, say, as the inverse second power of the distance to-day, but possibly as the inverse tenth power to-morrow. Or even, while they attract each other to-day, they may repel each other to-morrow. We feel that causality is violated when a given state A is not always followed by the same state B. A definition of the word "state" is certainly necessary, but we may</page><page sequence="9">H. Margenau I 4 reserve it until later. At present the customary intuitive mean- ing will suffice. This property by which any given state has associated with it a unique consequent state has previously' been called "consistency of nature." To avoid circumlocutions we shall continue to use this term. In more adequate phraseology, and without the unsatisfactory reference to states, consistency of nature may be characterized by saying: As a result of the consti- tution of nature, the differential equations by means of which it is described do not contain explicit functions of the time. This statement is less definite than it seems because it does not contain directions as to the choice of variables appearing in the equations, a vagueness which is the counterpart of the indefinite meaning of "state." The existence of variables must of course be supposed since they form the condition under which description of nature is possible at all. But then, if nature is consistent in this sense, the integrated equations will not depend on time in an absolute manner; more specifically if x = f(t) is a solution, then x = f(t - to) is another, so that the motion in question has an arbitrary be- ginning in time which becomes fixed only if accessory conditions are known. Furthermore, to use a previous example, the expo- nent in Coulomb's law of attraction will be invariable in time; if it is -2 to-day it will be -2 forever. The same should hold for all parameters appearing in the differential equations of physics if nature is consistent or causal. It is to be remembered, however, that the occurrence of equa- tions which do not satisfy this requirement, is not at once a proof against causality. In fact we often encounter such equations when a problem is not completely analyzed, for example in the case of forced oscillations. But here, as well as in all similar cases, the explicit time dependence could be eliminated by including in the analysis those parts of the system which produce the varying force, i.e. by "closing" the system. "Impressed forces" always indicate that the physical system in question is an open one. In fact a closed system is simply one to which causal analysis can be applied, that is one which can be described by differential equa- tions not containing the time explicitly. Another point of im- 1H. Margenau, The Monist, Jan. 1932.</page><page sequence="10">142 Causality portance is this: An equation which originally satisfied the causal requirement will, after a single integration, no longer do so. We express this state of affairs by saying that we now have an "equa- tion of motion" and not a "law." (Incidentally it would be very desirable to standardize this particular meaning of the word law in natural science.) Nevertheless this introduces an uncertainty into our formulation of the causal principle, but one which cannot be avoided. It will occupy us when we discuss the analytic char- acter of causality, its property as a non-tautological proposition. Consistency, the central issue of the causality postulate, banishes absolute time from the description of nature (equations of motion) by eliminating time explicitly from its essential rep- resentation (differential equations, laws). It is the only formu- lation which does so. The elimination is necessary because abso- lute time has no physical meaning. Another advantage is the simplicity of the consistency formula, which nevertheless involves everything implied in the usual conceptions of causality, such as the existence of unique laws, strict determinism as far as it is a concomitant of causality. (It does not imply, however, that future events be actually known or knowable by an individual.) Theorems of conservation (energy, momentum), generally felt to be in some way connected with the causality principle but unaffected by its customary formulations, follow at once as analy- tical consequences from the fact that the differential equations do not involve the time explicitly. The principle of consistency, and hence of causality, has no meaning if it can be applied only to the universe as a whole. For in that case the number of describing variables would probably be infinite and the description in terms of differential equations loses its sense. Using the more intuitive definition according to which a state A is always followed by the same state B the failure is evident when we realize that state A may occur only once. Causality is then an empty phrase unless the universe is periodic. But the same would be true of all the laws of physics, in fact of physics as a science, if its statements were inapplicable to small domains of nature. Hence the condition that causality shall have meaning is the same as that for the existence of science.</page><page sequence="11">H. Margenau 143 The philosopher who argues that the consistency definition be void forgets that his argument nullifies science as a whole. As a matter of experience the universe is separable into smaller systems to which differential equations can be applied, and if these equa- tions are of the type here postulated then nature is causal. An observation of this kind carries little weight with those who feel too keenly that the processes in the universe are separable only to a rough approximation. One is entitled to discuss this attitude in earnest only if he is willing to accept all of its conse- quences which include the proposition that science is an illusion. But we note in the first place that it is by no means necessary for an arbitrary nature to be roughly or approximately separable into systems whose fates are independent; to say that it is imposes a definite restriction even if the separation is not completely pos- sible. But let us consider more exactly how it is performed. Measurements on the force of attraction between two electric charges will not in general verify Coulomb's law. We observe that the force depends in some peculiar way upon the position of external charges, which suggests to us that the measured effects are not entirely due to the system in question, namely the two test charges. This is expressed by stating that the system is not completely separated from its surroundings. Next we remove our system farther and farther from surrounding bodies and notice a gradual improvement in the consistency of the measurements. Now the situation would be very simple and satisfactory if pro- gressive isolation produced better and better agreement between the observations. For then the condition of complete isolation, i.e. a closed system, could be defined by a simple limiting process much in the same manner as limits of functions are defined in mathematics. However, the situation is here of greater com- plexity, though still manageable. The agreement is improved only up to a certain point, and then further isolation fails to make itself felt. We have reached the limit of precision of our measure- ments. This limit of precision is a very definite thing which scientists have always considered very carefully. Quantum mechanics emphasizes it greatly and even renders its value in some instances calculable by means of the uncertainty relation.</page><page sequence="12">I44 Causality Nevertheless there is a well known method of dealing with the ever present divergence of observations: the theory of errors al- lows us to compute the most probable value of a measurement from any group of observations. It is the limit of this most prob- able value upon which we base the derivation of Coulomb's law, and not the limit to which actual observations tend. The latter does not exist, but the former does. Hence it is possible to define a state of separation, not by actual physical operations but by blending experimentation with reasoning. We wish to empha- size in this connection that physical concepts need not-and can not-be defined solely in terms of experimental operations or observations; it is both customary and proper in scientific investi- gations to characterize an abstract state of affairs by its logical consequences if they are more simply expressible, whether they are observable or not. For example, when we state the second law of thermodynamics in the form: the entropy of the universe increases, then there is no way of testing the law as such; its evi- dence arises from considerations formally similar to those which have convinced us of the existence of closed systems to which differential equations are applicable. By its definition, a closed or independent physical system is a causal one, because we call it closed when the laws governing its behavior do not involve the time. But strictly speaking only closed systems are accessible to physical analysis. Thus it would seem that physics can never inform us of a failure of the causality principle. This brings us to a point of importance: Is the causal principle a tautology? Here we are forced to make a large concession; an unbiased investigation must not fail to recognize its character as an analytic proposition. Kant, who thought of it as an a priori synthetic judgment, did not formulate it in a way in which its analytic character became apparent. It is certainly true that whenever a physical system does not appear to be closed, that is when the differential equations describing it contain the time explicitly (if it does not behave consistently), we conclude that the variables determining the state in question are not completely known. We then look immediately for hidden properties whose variation may have produced the inconsistencies,</page><page sequence="13">H. Margenau 445 and whose inclusion in the analysis would eliminate them; more- over if we do not find any we invent them. This procedure is possible because in the consistency formulation of causality the term "state" is undefined. The corresponding indefiniteness in the more abstract formulation lies in the absence of specifications as to the number of variables entering into the differential equa- tions on the one hand, and of the order of the equations on the other. If the number of variables is increased indefinitely, or if an indefinite number of differentiations is permitted, time depend- ence can be ultimately eliminated no matter how complicated the processes of nature, provided only that the equations of motion can be differentiated a sufficient number of times. But this re- quires no more than a certain smoothness and continuity which nature certainly satisfies.-On the whole it seems, then, that the causality postulate reduces to a definition of what is meant by "state." It is an agreement to consider those quantities as com- posing the state of a system which enter into a time free differen- tial equation describing its behavior. This line of reasoning leads at once to the inevitable question: Why retain the proposition if it is merely tautological? Tautolo- gies, as everybody knows, add nothing to the knowledge of nature; they expose a property already included in the term they are to explain; their careless use often produces vicious circles. All this is true in a sense; but to suppose that tautologies are always use- less and to be avoided is a very common fallacy. Every definition is a tautology except the first time it is stated. To the writer the word tautology conveys something more objectionable than the gool old "analytic judgment." Really the two are synonymous, and one must free himself from any intuitive bias that may cling to the former term. The principle of conservation of energy is a tautology in the proper sense of the word, yet nobody doubts its fruitfulness, and it is even customary to speak of its validity as though it were an actual proposition about the world. The point in question is this: The general definition of the principle contains no restriction as to the number of different kinds of energy which may be transformed into one another and whose sum is constant. If this number became indefinitely great as a conse-</page><page sequence="14">146 Causality quence of invention whenever a new type was needed the principle would hardly be applicable, it would merely define energies. As a matter of fact, however, nature permits us to get along with very few different types of energy, and its description in terms of energies is exceedingly useful and convenient. Therefore, while the energy principle in its logical formulation is a tautology which amounts to a definition of energies, the analysis of nature in terms of this definition is advantageous. Precisely the same is true with regard to causality. Its logical formulation is inevita- bly tautological and leads to a definition of physical "states," or a selection of variables in the differential equations. But this selection is useful and applicable, so that the causality principle, though tautological in its abstract form, does amount to a state- ment about nature. Moreover it makes sense to say that nature is not causal, for this would be true if, in an attempt to describe nature in accordance with our definition of consistency, the result- ing differential equations were found to contain very many vari- ables or to be of very high order. One might, of course, arbitrarily restrict the latter and permit only equations of the second order, but we feel that this would do violence to the common concep- tion of causality. We have seen that the tautological character of the consistency postulate is no particular fault. Indeed the postulate may be transformed into a synthetic statement if this be desired, but somewhat at the expense of its precision; it might be phrased: Nature is so constituted that its description in terms of differential equations which do not involve the time explicitly (such de- scription is admittedly possible!) is convenient.-We merely state that Laplace's causality formulation is also tautological, while the one identifying causality of nature with human power to prophesy is not. But it stands to reason that the latter modifi- cation, missing, as it does, the central point of the casuality con- cept, pays too large a price for its non-tautological form. In formulating the principle of causality we have almost solved the question as to its validity. Classical physics was based upon it and therefore presents no argument against it. The influence of quantum mechanics upon its status has been considered in</page><page sequence="15">H. Margenau I 4-7 detail in two previous publications,2 whose results may be stated briefly as follows: Classical analysis had come face to face with experiences which its usual methods failed to describe; in fact the treatment of certain problems threatened to become non-causal. At this very instant quantum mechanics achieved a revolutionary feat of great importance: it redefined the concept of physical states in a more abstract manner (in terms of mathematical func- tions satisfying certain requirements) and thereby restored the causal character of physical analysis. It was the conviction that the causality principle must be retained which inspired quantum mechanics although some of its creators have not been altogether conscious of this fact. The impression that quantum mechanics violates the principle now arises whenever the older classical con- ception of states (positions and velocities of the component parts of a system) is carelessly carried over into the new field of descrip- tion in which it has no meaning. The uncertainty principle forbids ultimate extrapolation to the quantities defining a state in the classical sense, but it does not prevent an ultimate extrapolation to /-functions. To be quite impartial one should add that the trustworthiness of quantum mechanics even in questions of ulti- mate extrapolation to classical states is not entirely evident, for it is precisely in the very small domains of space (structure of the nucleus, structure of the electron, and its trembling motion) where its present axioms break down. Quantum mechanics does not constitute an argument against causality. However there comes news from other quarters which may upset the validity of the causal principle. If, as has been reported, the velocity of light, which is an essential parameter in the differential equations of physics, undergoes a slow variation in time, then a revision of the postulate may be in order. Another significant objection has long been known although it is ordinarily overlooked. It has to do with spatial continuity of the universe. If the structure of nature's elements is continu- ous in space, and hence infinitely detailed, the equations repre- senting the behavior of any of its parts will of necessity contain an infinite number of variables. Hence causal analysis, as it pro- 2H. Margenau, The Monist, Jan. 193I; ibid. April I932.</page><page sequence="16">148 Causality ceeds into finer and finer details of structure, will meet the same obstacle which prevented it from exploring an inseparable uni- verse as a whole. Two means are available for avoiding this difficulty; both have been employed. One is to adopt a field theory which fixes minutely the values of a physical quantity at every point of space, but fixes it by means of simple functions so that the scientist is enabled to dominate in one grand sweep all the intricacies of spatial structure. There are reasons, how- ever, why this procedure is unsatisfactory. Unless the field functions used in physical theory are periodic they imply singu- larities which, while they are insignificant as far as many proper- ties of nature are concerned, certainly do not exist.-The other and probably the better way to escape the difficulty is to eliminate its roots, that is to abandon the conception of a continuous uni- verse. This is done in quantum theory by assuming the discrete existence of electrons, protons, neutrons, energy quanta and the like. The magic formula here was to reduce the number of vari- ables appearing in causal description by endowing finite parts of space with homogeneity, so that this finite portion requires no more elements of description than does a point. Here again, quantum theory comes to the rescue of the causality principle. Tale University.</page></plain_text>
