<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTES Amongst the Semites salt is credited with various purgative and protective powers. One of its most notable properties is its decom- posing action on blood, on account of which it came to be regularly applied to sacrificial meat. The neutralising and prophylactic prop- erties imputed to it are illustrated in the Old Testament by Elisha's use of it to cleanse a mischievous-and probably haunted-water- spring (2 Kings ii 19-22), and by its application to new-born infants to ward off malicious demons (Ezekiel xvi 4). To the latter usage close parallels can be cited from German Jewry (I. BENZINGER in Jewish Encyclopaedia, s.v. 'Salt', ad fin.) and the Yemen (E. BRAUER, Ethnologie der Jemenitischen Juden (1934), 388). Among the Moors salt is carried in the hand on going from room to room in the dark (FRAZER, GarneredSheaves (1931), 28); it is distasteful to the devil (ibid.), and it is effective against the evil eye (BENZINGER, loc. cit.). Theocritus describes its use in purging a house of the baleful effects of serpent visitants from the lower regions (xxiv 96-8; cf. the parallels in A. S. F. Gow's note ad. loc.). It was used for exorcism by the Nubians (J. L. BURCKHARDT, Travels in Nubia (1819), 169) and the Arabs (LANE, Arabian Society in the Middle Ages (1883), 41, 188). Further examples will be found in the articles on 'Salt' in the Bible dictionaries, in A. E. CRAWLEY'S article 'Metals and Minerals' in HASTINGS' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, and in S. A. COOK's additional note in W. R. SMITH'S Religion of the Semites 3 (1927), 594-5. From these examples it seems evident that when Abimelech scattered salt over the ruins of Shechem he had a similar apotropaic end in mind. His action was not a gesture or a token. The broadcast strewing of the salt was a last desperate attempt to neutralise the shades of the slaughtered Shechemites and to avert their vengeance. University of St. Andrews A. M.

L. 1950, 24 f.) has suggested the reading ormo which he combines with CDC i, 21. However, the last letter of the word in our passage is quite clearly a mem, although not a final one. The same shape of mem occurs in several places in DSD, e.g. in rin 195</page><page sequence="2">SHORT NOTES (xi, 3), tlr~n (xi, 6), tnr?Q (xi, 8)-and other instances could be mentioned. The first letter does not look like a waw, but it should be noticed that the first letter of the next line has got exactly the same shape and is obviously a waw-the peculiar shape of the letter concerned in both lines being due to the manuscript's being crumpled. The second letter has been corrected, apparently from 0 to r. I therefore suggest the reading n;m,l which I translate 'and terror', equating this word with Syriac hajymd, which occurs in the Syriac codices A, B and C of Luc. xxii 44; as a translation of yev6oevoq ev ytovqc we read there JI.o *o. it L 1 ML (cod. A and C) or Jao.co. (cod. B). F. SCHULTHESS in his Lexicon Syropalaestinum (p. 50) regards both readings as corrupt and draws especially attention to the use of the adverb t,oi; this word, however, does not suggest that the readings are wrong, but is used to mitigate the anthropomorphic way of expression. There is no reason to suspect the correctness of the tradition, the fact being that the word concerned in cod. A and C is written defective, in cod. B plene.-In our passage we find the word written plene. Thus we have in DSD a word which is other- wise known only from a Syriac version of an important Christian tradition. P1. ii, 9: mVn u'Tnl. Several suggestions have been made as to the solution of this expression, 1m:K having been equated with ni:t: "fathers" 1), nilk: "ghosts"2) and niwK: "enmity"3). All these suggestions are unsatisfactory. It has not been recognized by scholars that what we have in rnm 'tnnl is a Syriac idiom meaning "to intercede". In G. BICKELL'S Ephraemi Syri Carmina Nisibena (1866) no. LXVII at the end we read: ne'.hzd 'abwdt(i) I'abzh(i), which BICKELL translates: "occludat delicta mea patri suo".

In 1. 1 the American editors transcribe: 'rn :Sn ptn 1t1, obviously taking :Zt as a participle 1); other scholars prefer the reading u1tn, explaining nala either as a noun formed by the prefix n 2), or as an Aramaic infinitive 3). awl is a very common word both in DSD and CDC (the "Zadokite Fragments") and-constructed with --always occurs in the form :n1t (DSD i 17, v 1, 8, 22, vi 15, CDC x 3, xv 12, xvi 1,4); an Aramaic infinitive after 5 of this particular word in our passage would certainly be very odd. My suggestion is to read ltin ilt7v, regarding this expression as explanatory of p7n ("so that he can prolong, continue his life"), this word meaning "recover" (as from a disease), cf. Is. xxxix 1. In this connection it should be re- membered that the notion of salvation and eternal life as "recovery", "healing" occurs in DSD iv 6: "healing and abundant peace during length of days", cf. CDC viii 4 (which is also to be taken eschatolog- ically). - In 1. 2 the American editors transcribe Stv' plDn, appa- rently treating the passage as an allusion to Is. ix 4: 7iK0-D? t_y3n ]b: "every boot of one tramping in the tumult". All trans- lators (except BROWNLEE, who emends the text to ltihnn Sa%i nwKmzn) regard this allusion as beyond doubt, although it is generally as- sumed that the expression in our context is used in a non-literal see LANDSBERGER in Mitteilungen der altorientalischen Gesellschaft, Band IV, 310, and VON SODEN, Grundriss der akkadischen Grammatik (Analecta Orientalia, 33 (1952), 22. Prof. DRIVER, in a letter, tells me that he is convinced that abztu is from '13K "incline" and means "inclination", "desire", suggesting that it is possible that in Neo-Babylonian awdtu ("word") and ab4tu ("desire") have con- taminated one another. For the meaning "desire", "will" for abutu reference is made to such phrases as rumma abutu ialintu (K6HLER and UNGNAD, Assyrische Rechtsurkunden, XV, 46 (p. 16) and abaitam illak (HUNGER, Becherwahrsagung bei den Babyloniern, 56 (B61)), where the meaning "will" seems far more probable than "word". Prof. DRIVER has kindly drawn my attention to the occurence of the expression abdta abdau (see e.g. Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, IV, 256, 1. 19 (p. 241): li-hu-gu a-bu-us-su, which forms a still closer parallel to the phrase in our passage. 1) BROWNLEE (BASOR, Supplementary Studies, no. 10-12, p. 12), SCHUBERT (op. cit., 44) and DEL MEDICO (op. cit., 38). 2) MILIK (op. cit., 138) and LAMBERT (op. cit., 959). 3) VAN DER PLOEG (op. cit., 1952, 128). 197</page><page sequence="4">SHORT NOTES sense. It is not certain that a reference to Is. ix 4 gives the clue to the understanding of our passage. A glance at the manuscript makes it clear that one might just as well read Raa: in stead of Rtto: and translate: "for in them (i.e. in nSr, ni; and p,n of the impious) is iniquity", this interpretation giving a very clear reason for the pre- vious prohibition. The following itVr;i Sti is an echo of Hos. x 13: Sth r.i nn, the verb there not having been taken in the meaning "to plough" (which undoubtedly is the meaning of the Hebrew text, cf. the parallelism iSp), but in the meaning "to think, devise'", cf. Prov. iii 29, vi 18. The object S7_i, no doubt, has caused this interpretation of aWIn., cf. LXX: vao r 7ape&lt;Mtw07rcrTe acert3av, rin having been taken as "be silent, dumb". Making a stop after jPR 0:a wn, it is easy to recognize that v'ltnnur wn and nmn= t, wIm form a rhythmical parallelism; so, the form wtlina should be taken as lp + infin. constr. with suffix, parallel with the following : + inml. inlta is not an error, the form n;lv having been recorded by PETERMANN 1) as a Samaritan variation of :1t. I take the verb to mean "apostatiZe", see the usage of the verb in DSD vii 23, x 11, CDC xix 34. xl* p,7,. The fourth word of the line is read by the American editors as 'vnn:. This reading implies that the word is derived from inl "to loosen", a derivation defended by several scholars 2).-A comparison with CDC iii 11 f. and ii 16 throws light on our passage. In CDC iii 11 f we read: Q:n nlint "linl nin m , and in ii 16: linn tt'i n7fl7k 'r nl7vnnlt; that we have in these passages the same verb as in DSD iii 3 there can be no doubt, and the interesting thing is that in CDC ii 16 the word has been vocalized as ldtzr. So, we may conclude that the form in DSD iii 3 is to be derived from *iln and not from ini. The verb in CDC iii 11 and ii 16 means "to walk about" (arab. tara), with *rnt "folgen", "sich verlocken lassen" 3), cf. Numb. xv 39. It is natura1 to take nlnna in our passage in the same sense; the form nina might, then, be explained as nomen actionis with 1) "Versuch einer hebriischen Formenlehre nach der Aussprache der heutigen Samaritaner" ( Abhandlungen fiir die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol.

Most scholars take Ilin as the object 2), or as modifying the object 3). It is important to realize the full meaning of trln applied in connection with the impious. Their doings are dark (ii 7), they walk on the ways of darkness (iii 21, iv 11), their origin is darkness (iii 19), their ruler is the Angel of darkness (iii 21), darkness is the element, in which they live, they are "Sons of dark- ness" (i 10), irreconcilably opposed to "Sons of light" (i 9, ii 16). This opposition of light and darkness is to be understood in a strictly dualistic sense; the light-darkness terminology of DSD reminds one of Johannine way of thought. I suggest the equation of ttvln with ']in2 (an interchange due to the frigative pronunciation of begadkephat) and translate accordingly: "(It is) in darkness (that) he looks at the ways of light", the meaning being that, living in dark- ness, he cannot possibly understand the ways of light, although they are visible, cf. John i 5. The line states the simple fact of the insuperable contradiction between and the irreconcilability of light and darkness, cf. especially iv 16b-18a. To this interpretation the next passage presents a perfect parallelism, the meaning being quite clear: the impious cannot possibly be reckoned as perfect. If the text of our passage is right, we must combine pIs with l]vl2 in the Hab.-Com. iv 8, in which expression WEISS 4) sees the influence of the Arabic bi'ain: "in the presence of". This interpretation, how- ever, makes hardly any sense in connection witti wn, which is in DSD constructed with my (iii 1) or : (v 11, 18; cf. CDC xix 35). However, our passage has been satisfactorily explained by BARTH&amp;- LEMY 5): what we actually have is an aural error, IY2 having to be equated with w:5, and we may translate: "He cannot be reckoned with the perfect". Thus we may translate the whole passage iii lb-4a: "He cannot recover (and thus prolong his life) and with the upright he cannot be reckoned, and his knowledge and his strength and his property must not come (1ixi1) into the council of the community, for in them is iniquity: wickedness (results) from his device and defilement (is caused) by his apostasy; and he cannot be justified because of his walking-about in the stubbornness of his heart.

PI. vii 10-12. The problems of this little section centre in the interpretation of the verbs ltoc and lDpr. The most common meaning of nto in Niphal in Aramaic is "to depart"; so, some scholars have rightly suggested that meaning here 3). In 1. 10 two cases of inattention are mentioned: sleep and departure. The root lpt means "to erect" (transitive), "to stand upright" (intransitive). LAMBERT 4) has drawn attention to the occurrence of the Accadian equivalent Eaqdpu in a Mari-letter 5), where the verb is used with the meaning "to protest", "to claim", a meaning which is also attested in Old Babylonian, and in Neo-Assyrian documents 6). Supposing it is this use of the verb that we have in our passage, the meaning is: "- but if they protest (against his departure, i.e. if they claim his presence) and he departs (in spite of that), then he is to be punished 30 days".

The meaning "to pro- test" of Accadian zaqdpu (which is secondary to the meaning "to plant, erect") is preserved in Syriac !zqaf which (in partic. pass.) is used in Peshitta of 2 Tim. iv 15 (as a translation of &amp;vrian TOZo [LeTzipoto X6yoLo): zeqif luqbal melyan (PAYNE SMITH'S Thesaurus, col. 1148). Prof. DRIVER, in a letter to me, asserts that ana .... zaqdpu in Assyrian means "to stand against, resist, make a claim against", whereas zaqdpu alone does not mean "to claim", but "to stand up"; the use of the verb in our passage, therefore, refers to some procedure of which standing-up was an essential part, probably voting, of which Mishna Sanhedrin says that the court stood to record its vote. Accordingly, the context is interpreted by prof. DRIVER in the following way: the person concerned can go out two or three times in the sight of all for a valid reason (e.g. to relieve nature), while the com- pany is sitting, but not without reason; and he certainly must not slink out, when no one is looking, especially when the company is voting, thus shirking his responsibility. 200</page><page sequence="7">SHORT NOTES wording of the last half of the passage (rinp izn) is clearly dependent on Job xxxiii 6 (.x , .i..j,p , ni), and the idea expressed is identical with Gen. ii 7, Job iv 19, x 9 (where LXX reads I?rn in stead of in»rn), Sap. vii 1, ix 15. Ecclus xvii 1. Joseph. Ant. Jud., I, § 34 and many passages in Midrash Rabbah 1), according to which primeval man (and his posterity) is created of earth, dust or clay. However, the doctrine soon arose that the actual creation of the individual man is brought about by means of semen virile 4). In some passages "water" is used, equal to "seed" 2). With this fact in mind a very interesting light is thrown upon a passage in SUKENIK'S Megilloth Genuzoth 3), which runs as follows: ;t n, n Inzr ir" ntnm m vr, 5~ "" X n : "I am something fashioned of clay -(of) what (significance) am I?-something kneaded with water -as whom can I be reckoned?" That in this passage zrn means "seed" is very probable, not only because of the parallels mentioned, but especially because the combination of "clay" and "water" strongly reminds us of several passages in the Koran, where these two ele- ments are mentioned as the ones from which man is created, "clay" alluding to primeval man and "water" (= seed) to his posterity 4). It seems clear that our passage alludes to something similar, in other 1) See Midrash Rabbah, translated by H. FREEDMAN and M. SIMON, Gen. viii 9, xvii 4, 8; for more references, see index volume under "Adam", "man" and "creation". 2) Sap. vii 2 may be regarded as the first evidence of this idea, to which Rab- binic writings bear testimony. Clear is Pirqe Aboth III. 1: Dt 31I ne2 ]t M 1'7 nnlO ("Know from where you have come: from a stinking drop!") C. TAYLOR (Sayings of the Jewish Fathers, 153) is mistaken in referring to Heraclitic meta- physical speculations (BYWATER, Heracliti Ephesii Reliquae, §68) as an expla- nation of this passage). In Sota 5a Yn1O is probably alluding to the same doctrine; in Jer. Tal. Jeb. IV 5c the conception is called the "first" creation; in Tanchuma, Piqqude 3 this theme is treated at great length (the passage is quoted in trans- lation in F. WEBER,Jiidische Theologie (2.

That the "water" is not to be taken in a literal sense, but is a euphemism for "seed" has been supposed by the Muslim commentators (see e.g. Tabari and Zamakhshari on Sura xxiv 44 and xxxii 6-7, and can be proved by reference to Sura xxii 5, xxiii 12-13 and xxxv 12, where turab and tin are followed by nutfa (drop of semen) and to Sura lxxxvi 6 f., where ma'i by the continuation dafiqi" yahrudju min baini-ssulbi wa-ttar'ibi: "pouring forth, issuing from the loins and the ribs" is clearly used in the meaning "semen"; cf. also Sanhedrin 91a. 201</page><page sequence="8">202 SHORT NOTES words: the word, generally translated by "only" (puj), means "saliva" (read as pi).
