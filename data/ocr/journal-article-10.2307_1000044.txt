<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALICE BURNETT Virginia Frank Child Development Center, Chicago, Illinois Montessori Education Today and Yesterday Cities from the East to the West Coast, including Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Montreal, Philadelphia, and Toronto are showing renewed en- thusiasm for Montessori schools. Bos- ton College announced in March that in the fall of 1962 Sister M. Josephine, a member of the faculty, would be in charge of a Montessori class. Catholic journals and popular weekly maga- zines have carried feature articles about Whitby School, which recently moved from a remodeled stable into an expen- sive, new building in Greenwich, Con- necticut (1). After forty years of limited concern, there is a startling renewed interest and enthusiasm for Montessori educa- tion in North America. Nancy McCor- mick Rambusch, headmistress of the Whitby School, is the principal pro- ponent of this new concern. Her new book, Learning How To Learn: An American Approach to Montessori, pub- lished by Helicon Press in 1962, is a thoroughly up-to-date interpretation. The book is a well-written, spirited, and informative description of the Montessori-inspired approach for young children. Devotees claim that Montessori methods develop readers at four, writers at five, and parsers at seven years of age. Here I should like to consider a few of the elements which, before the de- pression, seemed to stem the tide of large-scale adoption of Montessori schools in this country. Some back- ground of the Montessori movement will be included to help put present ac- tivities in perspective. Maria Montessori developed a unique system of education for young children. She actively interpreted and promoted her work for almost half a century, until her death just ten years ago. Dr. Montessori's training was in medicine; she earned the first M.D. awarded to a woman by the University of Rome. Work with retarded children led her to develop techniques and materials for their education. These children ad- vanced so dramatically that Dr. Mon- tessori became interested in using her methods with normal children. Thus, she began the educational work that brought her international acclaim. Madame Montessori remains the only woman educator to achieve such re- nown. 71</page><page sequence="2">72 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL November 1962 School in a housing development In 1907 the representative of a Ro- man building concern asked Dr. Mon- tessori to organize a school for the young children in a new slum housing development. This fortuitous event co- incided with her interest in the possible use of her methods to teach normal children. Madame Montessori trans- ferred her attention from work with mentally retarded children to work with children of the Roman slums. This first school was called a casa dei bambini; it was soon followed by others. These "houses of children" be- came world-famous. In them children, ranging from three to seven years of age, worked with Montessori equip- ment and were guided by Montessori methods. Girls and boys learned to manage most of the routine chores of daily living at "school," where they remained all day. Arnold Gesell de- scribed her system as one that would "socialize the maternal function" in these all-day classes (2). Children in a casa also quite happily learned many skills of the three R's. Publicity on the progress of these children spread rapidly. By 1912 Doro- thy Canfield Fisher had written a book on Montessori education for mothers in America (3). If children of the poor could succeed so well, why not help children who had more of the everyday advantages at home? Teachers and would-be teachers from many countries visited the case and Dr. Montessori in Rome before World War I. Many people wanted to learn about this new education first- hand. Montessori methodology relied on a "prepared environment" and a se- quential order of learning activities. Carefully selected materials, pieces of equipment, and didactic apparatus were basic elements of the environment. First, Maria Montessori, or a Montes- sori "directress," showed the correct use of the apparatus. After an introduc- tion, "auto-education" and "self-cor- rective" learning were to take place. Children had separate work areas, and the room arrangement was quite flex- ible. The role of the directress, or mistress, was largely tutorial. She dem- onstrated procedures and kept records of each child's activities. She also di- rected the flow of routine classroom living (4, 5, 6). These methods re- main relatively unchanged today; train- ing for Montessori teaching is firmly grounded in the approach described. Basic Montessori work for young children is directed toward promot- ing sense experiences. Sense education provides the foundation for children's learning in the skill areas of read- ing, writing, and arithmetic. Materials for sensory learning include sandpaper shapes, rods of beads, graded wooden blocks, and insets of geometric forms. Specific exercises and procedures with the materials precede reading and writ- ing. When boys and girls successfully completed work in the house of chil- dren, they could write and read in script (cursive style), name continents, diagram sentences, handle complicated number problems, and manage most of the routine housekeeping chores. Montessori methods remain relative- ly unchanged today, as already in-</page><page sequence="3">MONTESSORI 73 dicated. "Pure" or "real" Montes- sori equipment comes from recognized sources. Schools and teachers also are authorized by the official Montessori organization-the Association Mon- tessori Internationale, whose director is Mario Montessori. Mario is Dr. Montessori's foster son and sole heir. Headquarters for the organization are in Holland, where a factory for produc- ing Montessori equipment is also lo- cated. Toy manufacturers in this coun- try supply their versions of some Mon- tessori apparatus. These adaptations are frequently called "educative" toys, and some have been on the market here for almost fifty years. In an author- ized Montessori school, the materials, methods, and activities are those devel- oped by their originator, Maria Mon- tessori, and now regulated by her son, Mario, and the international organiza- tion (7). When Montessori methods were be- ing developed, they seemed very dif- ferent from existing teaching-learning procedures. Just the idea that such young children could learn for them- selves, given the proper materials, was startling. The teacher's role was quite new: she demonstrated correct proce- dures with the materials. She did not talk very much, and she did not plan the activities for the children. At the turn of the century, teachers in infant schools, kindergartens, and primary grades considered it their "bounden duty" to plan for specific group learn- ing. The idea that a child should go to school, select his own activity-quite apart from the activities of his thirty or more classmates-was almost revo- lutionary. Dr. Montessori's schooling was dramatically new. Publicity on the progress of her slum children brought visitors from many parts of the world. Some visitors re- mained to study with Dr. Montessori. Followers opened schools in their own countries. In the United States, inter- est in Montessori teaching reached a peak just before World War I. Mon- tessori schools were organized. Moth- ers followed Dorothy Canfield Fish- er's suggestions and taught their own children with Montessori apparatus. At the San Francisco Fair Dr. Montessori herself came to this country. In 1915 she addressed the convention of the National Education Association in Oakland, California (5, 8). E. M. Standing's biography of Maria Montessori describes a Montes- sori class held at the 1915 San Fran- cisco Fair (9). Helen Parkhurst, then a Montessori student and later origina- tor of the Dalton Plan, directed the class at the fair. Through specially constructed glass partitions, passers-by could observe children happily learn- ing. Substantial, yet unsuccessful ef- forts were made to persuade Dr. Mon- tessori to teach in this country for at least a year. In spite of the publicity, the influence of Montessori education almost disappeared in North America long before the depression years. Montessori schools continued else- where, however; they flourished in some European countries. Switzerland established the Montessori system in all its public schools (10). The inter- national appeal of this type of educa-</page><page sequence="4">74 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL November 1962 tion caused the good doctor to main- tain that the "child was the only true world citizen," and she carried on a crusade for peace through education (11). Various reasons may account for disenchantment with the Montessori system in America. Anti-Italian feel- ing aroused during the first world war must have contributed to the decline of her following. During the postwar period heightened interest in child wel- fare helped increase the number of kindergartens in the public schools. Kindergartens, in turn, were influenced by Montessori teaching. Their pro- grams provided for more classroom freedom and frequently called for Mon- tessori equipment. However, "pure" Montessori schools did not prosper. Another powerful deterrent to the organization of Montessori classes in the USA was the criticism leveled by advocates of newer educational meth- ods. Educational reform, relaxation of rigid discipline, made more headway here in the first quarter of the century than in other countries. Instead of being somewhat revolutionary in the United States, Montessori methods ap- peared to have elements of rigidity and seemed to be based on a type of au- thoritarianism deemed undesirable. If not undesirable, the approach was con- sidered to be less desirable than pro- gressive education. Nursery schools first opened in this country soon after World War I. They were compatible with the newer edu- cational approach and perhaps took hold while enthusiasm for Montessori schools or kindergartens passed into the background. Visit from an American In 1912 William Heard Kilpatrick, a Dewey disciple from Columbia Uni- versity Teachers College, went to Rome to see Dr. Montessori and visit a casa dei bambini. It should be noted that by that time Madame Montes- sori's official connection with the case had ended. Through an interpreter, Kilpatrick discussed Dr. Montessori's ideas with her. When Kilpatrick re- turned to this country, he was in great demand as a lecturer on Montessori. He was so frequently called on to dis- cuss his findings that he published The Montessori System Examined, a criti- cal evaluation of Montessori education (12). Kilpatrick valued the Montessori approach. Compared to the Lancastri- an or monitorial system, it allowed for considerable personal classroom liber- ty. But he refuted the authoritarian dictates of precise procedures and un- alterable sequence. Under the Mon- tessori approach, children were free to choose activities only from among those to which they had already been introduced by the directress. Once a child settled on a choice, he had to carry out the full procedure in the proper manner. For instance, children could not use the cylinders to make a train or the mathematics step materials to make a building. Kilpatrick was somewhat astonished to find that Dr. Montessori believed in faculty psychology and transfer of training; that is, she believed that prac- tice or training in one faculty or ca- pacity would benefit another. The idea is related to the belief that study of</page><page sequence="5">MONTESSORI 75 mathematics or Greek disciplines the mind. Montessori's educational plan- ning disregarded co-operation in learn- ing activities and made no provision for imaginative activities. Maria Montessori described her ed- ucational methods and ideas in scien- tific terms. She claimed that her meth- ods were "anthropomorphic" and that the school itself was the "scientific laboratory of experimental pedagogy." Kilpatrick praised Dr. Montessori for her scientific grounding and for her in- terest in developing methods based on scientific principles. He felt that this was a major contribution to over-all educational thinking. Individual meas- urement and records on each child be- came basic elements of scientific edu- cational planning-in Montessori and non-Montessori approaches. Two critics Arnold Gesell and his wife included criticism of the Montessori kindergar- tens, or Montessori nurseries, as they referred to them, in their earliest study of children, The Normal Child and Pri- mary Education (2: 323-40). This book is particularly significant because of Gesell's background in education and medicine. Before he embarked on his career of studying young children, he had been a teacher. Gesell and his wife were even more negative about the Montessori ap- proach than Kilpatrick was. They did not find much really new in the system of education. In addition, they were concerned about the seeming Ameri- can tendency to believe that the pur- chase of a set of didactic materials could work a miracle in education. They commended the skill of the di- rectresses and specifically noted the im- portance of well-trained people in such a program. Their reaction to Montessori educa- tion is well condensed in the following statement: "The moment that one re- duces any philosophy of education to concrete, graduated material, it loses the unity and vital impulse which cre- ated it, and invites as many interpreta- tions as there are individuals to handle it. The Montessori system is an eight- hour nursery-kindergarten-school, and not a set of purchasable didactic ap- paratus" (2: 329). Reasons for the revival Noting this brief historical picture, one may wonder why a revival of in- terest is taking place. Many American educators consider Montessori passee. These educators are not paying much attention to the growing enthusiasm. The May, 1962, issue of the Journal of Nursery Education has a provocative article on the revival of Montessori schooling (13). Emma Plank, a former Viennese Montessori-trained teacher and now a leader in American nurs- ery education, makes some interesting comparisons and observations on the system. She acknowledges that a re- vival is taking place. The American Montessori Society boasts of a mem- bership of more than three hundred (14). American revitalized interest in Montessori may stem in part from a generalized concern for bettering ed- ucation. The stress today is on more content and more formal structure for learning. Parents particularly are re-</page><page sequence="6">76 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL November 1962 ceptive to programs for earlier reading and writing. Development of cognitive powers certainly was advocated by Dr. Mon- tessori, who said: "We will help his [the child's] intellect, which tends to organize itself, to go on, to experiment, to acquire knowledge until he can more easily and more perfectly accomplish the effort of intellectual growth. He is destined, therefore, not to represent our inferior humanity, but to surpass us" (15). When critics contemplate present- day education in America, they fre- quently praise traditional and Euro- pean education. Visitors in Europe par- ticularly are amazed to see the accom- plishments of Montessori school chil- dren in Germany, France, England, Italy, and Holland. Another element of the resurgent in- terest in Montessori may be related to the fact that Dr. Montessori was church oriented. Each of her works has suggestions for religious teaching. In fact, some of her later writing was di- rected to religious education. Montes- sori education has been embraced most frequently by Roman Catholics. How- ever, neither Montessori methods nor her materials are necessarily related to parochial education. Her early work in Rome was sponsored by a housing au- thority, not the church. Protestant and Hindu church schools as well as schools with no religious affiliation have used Montessori methods. Montessori teaching may appeal to Roman Catholic parents who feel that some schooling is appropriate for their young children, although they find lit- tle provision in parochial education for children under six years of age. To such parents a Montessori school whose teachers are generally lay Catholic ed- ucators may well be acceptable, even welcomed. After all, Dr. Montessori, a lay Catholic, succeeded in being the only woman to receive widespread in- ternational acclaim as an educator. Reconsideration of contemporary criticism of the Montessori system is meaningful today. Dr. Montessori's own writings (in translation) and the newly published volume by Rambusch are excellent sources of information. Study of the Montessori approach to- day and yesterday would be an asset to those who are trying to decide whether more Montessori is the most meaningful method of developing chil- dren's educational potential. Is the magnetism of Montessori's stress on mental development really an expression of concern for magnifying or maintaining real learning activities for young children? Does the Montessori system have intrinsic merits that justify modifying or replacing current pro- grams? It is possible that in the popular- izing of a part of Montessori's system, the essence of Montessori education- which is to begin at the beginning of schooling and provide deliberately for individual development-may be over- looked.
