AFRICAN LITERATURE Nantet, Jacques, "Pr6sence de la litt6rature francophone, II.-En Afrique noire," Nou- velle Revue des Deux Mondes, No. 5:336-45, May 1975.

AMERICAN JEWISH LITERATURE Poger, Sidney, "American Jewish Fiction: Local Color Movement of the Fifties," CLA Journal, 18:404-11, March 1975. Jewish fiction appeared before America was really ready for it. However in the fifties there emerged a group of writers: Bellow, Philip Roth, Malamud and Wouk, who were not Jewish by accident, as were Nathanael West or Bret Harte, whose Jewishness did not affect their fiction. (T.T.B.) Schatt, Stanley, "The Torch and the Time Bomb: The Teaching of Jewish-American Literature Today," CLA Journal, 18:434-41, March 1975. Jewish literature stresses the passive yet resists twentieth-century apocalyptic romanticism. Despite obnoxious professional apologists like Roth, the literature contains a quality of affirmation in its refusal to be stereotyped--a sort of Jewish anti-Semitism. (T.T.B.) AMERICAN LITERATURE Gelfant, Blanche, "Residence Underground: Recent Fictions of the Subterranean City," Sewanee Review, 83:406-38, Summer 1975. The traditional roaming hero of American literature is fulfilled in movement. But the underground hero of some contemporary nov- els " ... can choose stasis, and find freedom, fulfill his life, in a simulated death and burial ... in the subterranean spaces ... beneath the modern city." (W.K.) ARAGON, LOUIS Ravis-Frangon, Suzanne, "Temps historique et temps romanesque dans 'La Semaine sainte'," Revue d'Histoire Littiraire de la France, 75:419-36, March-June 1975. Language is used as a tool of liberty against temporal servitudes. Aragon restitutes the con- tent of History on an imaginary mode: "ro- manesque" time itself is historical time. (J.-L.F.) ARON, ROBERT Jaudel, Jean, "Notre ami Robert Aron," Nou- velle Revue des Deux Mondes, No. 5:370, 489- 98, May 1975. U[Jaudel's memoirs of Aron, including extracts of his speech in the French Academy and of Jean Guitton's speech of welcome.] (T.T.B.) ARTAUD, ANTONIN Giudicelli, Christian, "Le Bain d'Artaud," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 270:77-81, June 1975. Artaud could not bear critics mangling the verses of a great poet from the semantic, mythological, historical or archeological point of view. His own work resists these types of analyses, X-rays and theses. (T.T.B.) AUB, MAX Borris, A. A., "Time, the 'Fourth Dimension,' in Max Aub's Theatre of Exile," Mosaic, 8:207-21, No. 3, Spring 1975. " ... although many of Aub's characters, such as his exiles, prisoners, and refugees, are entrapped in their environment, inscribed in the three dimensions of space, he offers us a 457</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTUR Y LITERATURE fourth dimension: time. To those characters of indestructible faith and of high ideals, time is a vital, eternal force which invites change, action, and creation." (C.M.C.) AUDEN, W. H. McDiarmid, Lucy S. and John, "Artifice and Self-Consciousness in Auden's The Sea and the Mirror," Contemporary Literature, 16:353- 77, Summer 1975. In contrast to Auden's other long poems, The Sea and the Mirror is unusual because it begins with disenchantment, the acknowledgment that the world of art is a temporary, artificial suspension of ordinary life. From that point, the poem searches for solid ground to end on, but substantiality is elusive and the illusion of theatre is finally not an illusion, but where in fact the characters and we always are. (M.P.K.) BAROJA, PIO Ibarra, Fernando, "Lo religioso en Baroja," Revista de Estudios Hisphnicos, 8:357-70, Oct. 1974. In spite of some assertions to the contrary, it is impossible to document in Baroja a deep concern for religious values or a "turn to the Church." (C.O.) BARTH, JOHN Tatham, Campbell, "Message (Concerning the Felt Ultimacies of One John Barth)," Boundary 2, 3:259-87, Winter 1975. Barth "'knows' the interminable and useless obligation to express. Accordingly, he elabo- rately manipulates his fictions in order to force the reader to experience the breakdown of strictly analytic verification in order to leave spaces (traces?) which may be felt-multiple differences/paradoxes which echo the arbi- trariness of existence." (D.P.) BARTHES, ROLAND Assad, Maria L., "La Lecture comme mythe," L'Esprit Criateur, 14:333-41, Winter 1974. Barthes presents the reading of a text as a new text, simultaneously the same yet different from the first. If identical, it is only the denotation of the text-object establishing the relation between the writer and his message. If otherwise, it becomes a second system where the message becomes the text-object. (T.T.B.) BECKETT, SAMUEL Brater, Enoch, "Dada, Surrealism, and the Genesis of Not I," Modern Drama, 28:49-59, March 1975. "In Not I Beckett has found it possible to reconcile his metaphysical dilemma and his histrionic inclinations: the intellectual quan- dary in which we are placed is framed in an emotionally charged, highly theatrical illu- sion, the sensationalism of a disembodied voice which assumes during the course of the play the horror of a talking, death-like skull ... ." (P.J.M.) Brater, Enoch, "The Thinking Eye in Beck- ett's Film," Modem Language Quarterly, 36:166-76, June 1975. "In Film Beckett abandons verbal structures and finds a congenial literature of the un-word in the visual language of cinema." Technical analysis brings out the significant relationship of this film to Beckett's other works. (G.S.) Kellman, Steven, "Beckett's Fatal Dual," Ro- mance Notes, 26:268-73, Winter 1975. "Beckett's either-or--or neither-nor-strategy is based on the recognition that the mind and the literary creation function according to the principle of divide and conquer." (J.-L.F.) Murphy, Vincent J., "Being and Perception: Beckett's Film," Modem Drama, 28:43-8, March 1975. In Film, the "To be is to be perceived by God" of the Berkeleian world becomes the more Proustian "To be is to be perceived by one- self." (P.J.M.) BENAVENTE, JACINTO Dial, John E., "Benavente: The Dramatist on Stage," Revista de Estudios Hispcnicos, 8:211- 8, May 1974. Benavente's characters tend always to be realistic. This is especially true in plays about playwrights or about some other aspect of stage life. (C.O.) BENJAMIN, WALTER Belmore, H. W., "Some Recollections of Walter Benjamin," German Life &amp; Letters, 28:119-27, Jan. 1975. "This is not the place to evaluate Benjamin's life work in detail. It is fragmentary and marked by unevenness-on the whole, a fail- ure of great promise." (J.R.R.) BLACKBURN, PAUL Eshleman, Clayton, "The Gull Wall," Bound- ary 2, 3:761-73, Spring 1975. "The gull is more than a central image in Blackburn's poetry; it is the presence of the creation itself ... . I have imagined his relationship to the gull as one of retreating in the gull's head to sit and be by himself, for it was contact with others that was much of his trouble." (D.P.) BLACK LITERATURE Edward, Ann, "Three Views on Blacks: The Black Woman in American literature," CEA Critic, 37:14-6, May 1975. 458</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY Langston Hughes and Jean Toomer created unforgettable women. Bessie Smith inspired Baldwin to be a writer. Black literature por- trays mothers, old women and grandmothers as sympathetic figures. (T.T.B.) BLATTY, WILLIAM P. Mendeloff, Harry, "Exorcism in Blatty and Berceo," Comparative Literature Studies, 11:218-25, Sept. 1974. In contrast with Berceo's thirteenth-century works on exorcism, Blatty's The Exorcist is more Gothic and sensational, more persistently humorless and horrible, and more pessimistic -in Berceo good always triumphs completely. (G.S.) BLOK, ALEKSANDR de Michelis, Cesare G., "Cristo e la rivo- luzione," Rivista di letterature moderne e com- parate, 28:28-46, March 1975. "Blok's poem ['The Twelve'], and especially the strophe which concludes it, is an extremely complex, many-leveled text which conceals within itself an intricate weave of cultural and literary allusions." (J.R.R.) BOLL, HEINRICH Nicolai, Ralf R., "Zum historischen Gehalt in B611s ErzAhlung 'Steh auf, steh doch auf'," Literatur in Wissenschaft und Unterricht, 8:12-7, April 1975. "The attempt here at interpretation will pro- ceed from the thesis ... that the grave fills an allegorical function which through the sub- sequent realistic landscape description is re- vealed as allegorical and applied to a concrete historical situation, Germany after its col- lapse." (J.R.R.) Parent, David J., "B611's 'Wanderer, kommst du nach Spa,' A Reply to Schiller's 'Der Spaziergang'," Essays in Literature, 1:109-17, Spring 1974. B611 replies to Schiller's attack on modern corruption as "a deviation from nature and a result of hybris in civilization that does not nullify the majesty of Greek beginnings," with a portrayal of nature as non-existent and a condemnation of Graeco-Roman antiquity "as the militaristic source of present evils." (W.G.F.) BONNEFOY, YVES Lawall, Sarah and Mary Ann Caws, "A Style of Silence: Two Readings of Yves Bonne- foy's Poetry," Contemporary Literature, 16:193-217, Spring 1975. The first of two rather incompatible readings of Bonnefoy "focuses on the verbal techniques of Bonnefoy's latest published 'fragments,' seeing both an awareness of the ambiguity of language, and an attempt to use linguistic polyvalence to blend speech and silence. The second reading considers, over the range of Bonnefoy's poetry, the temptation of silence itself." (M.P.K.) BOREL, JACQUES Clerval, Alain, "Entretien avec Jacques Borel," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 271:67- 73, July 1975. Since L'Adoration, which was more autobio- graphical than traditionally romantic, Borel, turning away from a literature of catharsis and influenced by Rousseau, has "invented" a romantic, melancholic Stendhal. (T.T.B.) BRAZILIAN LITERATURE White, Erdmute Wenzel, "Return of the Art- ist: The Quest for Authenticity in Brazilian Literature," Mosaic, 8:187-92, Spring 1975. Authenticity in Brazilian art dates from the 1920's when Oswald de Andrade published the two most significant manifestos of the decade. They were directed against "a social order which made any truly artistic initiative all but impossible." (C.M.C.) BRECHT, BERTOLT Knopf, Jan, "Ohnmacht der Macht oder Buchhaltung ohne Geschiftsfiihrer. Histori- ographie in Brechts Cisar-Roman," Deutschunterricht, 27:18-32, June 1975. Brecht shows Caesar as the product of histor- ical processes and general trends rather than as an individual, a free agent. Thus he breaks with the tradition of bourgeois historiography. (C.M.C.) Manzano, Isabel Garcia, "Lenguaje y expresi- vidad en 'Mann ist Mann' de Bertolt Brecht," Convivium (Barcelona), No. 41:35- 48, 1974. "This dependency of the aesthetic on the ethical is manifested in Brecht in the measure in which art, his art, is not an expression of purely subjective and individual values, but the process of human working within the abundance of possibilities which society of- fers." (J.R.R.) BUERO VALLEJO, ANTONIO Brown, Kenneth, "The Significance of Insan- ity in Four Plays by Antonio Buero Val- lejo," Revista de Estudios Hispjinicos, 8:247-60, May 1974. Insanity signifies man's conscious and sub- conscious desire to eliminate despotism and wretchedness and his ability to at least start the process. Sanity, on the other hand, may represent subservience, acquiescence, greed, and a life of deception. (C.O.) 459</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE CAMUS, ALBERT Henry, Patrick, "Camus on Capital Punish- ment," Midwest Quarterly, 16:362-70, Sum- mer 1975. Camus's opposition to the death penalty is evident in The Stranger, The Plague, The Rebel, and, in particular, Reflections on the Guillotine. " ... Camus sees capital punishment either as society's expression of repressive measures or as the result of a reigning ideology that exacts human sacrifice." (R.H.A.) Henry, Patrick, "Meursault as Antithesis of 'homo ludens' from J. Huizinga to Erre Berne," Kentucky Romance Quarterly, 21:365- 74, 1974. The game of justice is the play ritual par excellence. The absurdity in L'Atranger lies in the confrontation of the game-playing society and the protagonist who refuses to play, even though his life depends on it. (C.O.) Joiner, Lawrence, "Reverie and Silence in Le Renigat," Romance Notes, 26:262-7, Winter 1975. A key to understanding this narrative may lie in the linking of the themes of reverie and silence. The renegade's reveries are deceptive and his desire for their fulfillment is met only by silence. (J.-L.F.) CARDUCCI, GIOSUk Petrovska, Marija, "A Czech Admirer of Car- ducci," Comparative Literature Studies, 11:226-32, Sept. 1974. The great Czech poet Jaroslav Vrchlicky translated Carducci's poetry and wrote an important biographical and critical study of Carducci. Carducci in turn influenced Vrch- licky in the use of classical forms. (G.S.) CAROSSA, HANS Harrison, L., "The Treatment of the Hero in Hans Carossa's Jugendgeschichte," Modern Lan- guages, 56:17-21, March 1975. "There are two interrelated themes which thread their way through the whole work and give it a coherence ... the hero's relationship with his father and the reappearance, at every stage of life, of temperamental traits ... " (J.R.R.) CERNUDA, LUIS McMullan, Terence, "Luis Cernuda and the Emerging Influence of Pierre Reverdy," Revue de Littirature Comparie, 49:129-50, Jan.-March 1975. [A comparison between Les Apaves du ciel and Perfil del aire: vivid details, conceptualization of concrete objects, and impact of urban environment.] (J.-L.F.) CHANDLER, RAYMOND Kaye, Howard, "Raymond Chandler's Sen- timental Novel," Western American Literature, 10:135-45, Aug. 1975. Chandler's Marlowe in The Long Goodbye "is the all-American adventuring hero turned introspective, but basically unchanged ... Old-fashioned heroism is still possible, ac- cording to Chandler, but the price is ruinous." (W.G.F.) CHICANO LITERATURE Harrop, John and Jorge Huerta, "The Agit- prop Pilgrimage of Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino," Theatre Quarterly, 5:30- 9, March-May 1975. [A history of the Farmworkers' Theatre from its founding in 1965 to the present.] C.J.B.) CLAUDEL, PAUL Brunel, Pierre, "Claudel lecteur et juge de Milton," Revue de Littirature Comparie, 49:249-59, April-June 1975. Rather than giving an anthropomorphic rep- resentation, Claudel emphasizes the require- ments of taste and modern spirituality and makes of Paradise Lost the mirror of schismatic England. (J.-L.F.) COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Gutiirrez Girardot, Rafael, "Der Einfluss der Literatur der Vereinigten Staaten auf die iberoamerikanische Literatur," Jahrbuch fir Amerikastudien, 18:9-23, 1973. [Discusses the influence of Poe, Whitman, Frank, and Faulkner on Jos6 Asunci6n Silva, Ruben Dario, Eduardo Mallea, Juan Carlos Onetti and Gabriel Garcia Mirquez, and the parallelism in cultural and social development between the U. S. and Latin America which facilitated it.] (1.0.) Harth, Erica, "The Creative Alienation of the Writer: Sartre, Camus and Simone de Beauvoir," Mosaic, 8:177-86, Spring 1975. [Harth examines the experience of alienation in the three writers.] (C.M.C.) King, Russell, "Conrad's Almayer's Folly and Lenormand's Le Simoun: Some Aspects of Characterization," Revue de Littirature Com- parie, April-June 1975. Conrad integrates his characters into a mel- odramatic plot and background, and Le- normand uses his exotic bakground as a symbol of unconscious forces which his Eu- ropean characters try to comprehend. (J.-L.F.) Molina, Ida, "Vita activa and vita contemplativa: Buero Vallejo's El tragaluz and Hermann Hesse's Magister Ludi," Hispan6fila, 53:41-8, Jan. 1975. Buero, as always, stresses the intellectuals' 460</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY responsibility to strive for social well-being. Hesse's work represents a change from a Nietzschean elitism to a compassionate social consciousness. (C.O.) Spilka, Mark, "Lessing and Lawrence: The Battle of the Sexes," Contemporay Literature, 16:218-40, Spring 1975. What attracts both men and women to Less- ing's fiction is what attracted them to Law- rence's: an autobiographical intensity that reveals and exploits the author's self unspar- ingly, a prophetic arrogance or projected self-importance by which such characters are taken as where we are now or should be heading, and an immersion through such characters in some regional manifestation of the fate of a whole civilization in decline. (M.P.K.) CONRAD, JOSEPH Stark, Bruce R., "Kurtz's Intended: The Heart of Heart of Darkness," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 16:535-55, Fall 1974. Marlow's interview with the Intended is im- portant to the novel's structure. " ... the Sepulchral City is the inner circle and ... the source of the darkness invading the jungle ... ; the Intended's house is the innermost point of the inner circle and ... she represents ... the chief figure of the whole system." The woman and Conrad's imagistic description of her help us understand Marlow's delusion and appar- ent lie, Kurtz's reaction "'the horror,'" and Kurtz's final moral victory. (R.H.A.) CRANE, HART Lensing, George S., "Hart Crane's Tunnel from The Waste Land," Ariel, 6:20-35, No. 3, 1975. "The Tunnel" section of The Bridge owes an extensive debt to T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land. (C.J.B.) CREELEY, ROBERT Paul, Sherman, "A Letter on Rosenthal's 'Problems of Robert Creeley'," Boundary 2, 3:747-60, Spring 1975. "Poetry for Creeley, is the cry of its occasion, a necessary way of having life, 'an agony of self-realization [(as William Carlos) Williams wrote in "The Desert Music"] /bound into a whole/ by that which surrounds us.' And it saves the poet." (D.P.) CRITICISM Gillespie, Gerald, "New Apocalypse for Old: Kermode's Theory of Modernism," Boundary 2, 3:307-23, Winter 1975. "In a delicate balancing act, [Kermode] walks forward on the wire of intellectual history into an opaque future over the abyss of an an- nulled past, and only his hope anchors the invisible thread to something ahead. He dis- misses the New as an independent criterion, since communication either depends on a 'continuous extension or modification of con- ventions' or does not work." (D.P.) CUZZINI, AUGUSTIN Sienz, Gerardo, "Sempronio: Farce-Satire or Tragedy of our Time?" Neophilologus, 59:382-9, July 1975. This play "is much too serious to be consid- ered a farce or a satire ..... Cuzzini remem- bers that man originally intended government to serve him. But somewhere along the way, man gave up his position as master and relinquished it, by default, to his servant." (J.R.R.) DABIT, EUGENE Blot, Jean, "Une Lecture d'Eugene Dabit," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 271:122-6, July 1975. Dabit's world of populism, e.g., L'lle, H tel du Nord and Villa Oasis, a combination of opaque- ness and transparency, was more than a social class. From its richness and the autonomy of its values it was comparable to a civilization surviving on the margin of a dominant cul- ture. His Petit-Louis was an ancestor of Camus' L' -tranger. (T.T.B.) DEGUY, MICHEL Smock, Ann, "Re-turning Disemblance: Readings of Two Poems by Michel Deguy," Sub-Stance, No. 10:17-31, 1974. In "Blasons," "a landscape is inaccessible because it has already been spoken too long. Chains of names imprison the poet who wants to greet it by its own name." In "Epi- grammes," "the relationship of a man to a landscape is re-turned"; the man's mastery over the land "gives place to an unawareness where the two of them are as one." (D.P.) DELIBES, MIGUEL Crescioni Neggers, Gladys, "Cinco horas con Miguel Delibes," Estafeta Literaria, No. 565:7-9, June 1, 1975. Essentially a realist, Delibes has difficulty in penetrating the feminine soul. (T.T.B.) DIRY, TIBOR Gachot, Frangois, "Tibor D6ry a quatre-vingts ans," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 272:86-8, August 1975. In his early novels D6ry projected on his characters the essential of his own experiences as a Communist. His imprisonment for trans- lating Gide, and the execution of Laszlo Rajk, led to La Riponse; his exclusion from the party 461</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTUR Y LITERATURE and his second imprisonment turned him to essays, autobiography and a series of portraits and personal recollections. (T.T.B.) Sanders, Ivan, "The Ironic Hungarian: Tibor D6ry at Eighty," Books Abroad, 49:12-8, Winter 1975. D6ry's works reflect his cultured and sensitive consciousness as a writer, the influence of other modernist figures, notably Thomas Mann, and his concern with his native coun- try and its history. (M.P.K.) DHOTEL, ANDREI Clerval, Alain, "Entretien avec Andre Dhb- tel," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 270:64-70, June 1975.

DRABBLE, MARGARET Libby, Marion Vlastos, "Fate and Feminism in the Novels of Margaret Drabble," Con- temporary Literature, 16:175-92, Spring 1975. Drabble's first five novels "reveal a developing vision of a world governed by an almost seventeenth-century version of fatalism." In the sixth novel, The Waterfall, Drabble moves beyond absolute determinism to conceive a female character whose beauty and strength consist in a struggle against the preordained circumstances of her life. (M.P.K.) DRAMA Carpenter, Charles A., "Modern Drama Stud- ies: An Annual Bibliography," Modern Dra- ma, 28:61-116, March 1975. (P.J.M.) DUNCAN, ROBERT A. K. Weatherhead, "Robert Duncan and the Lyric," Contemporary Literature, 16:163-74, Spring 1975. A fairly large number of Duncan's poems "attempt, in spite of the necessary nature of things, to take over the prerogatives of paint- ing," especially collage, "and to exist in spatial terms." (M.P.K.) DURAS, MARGUERITE Champagne, Roland, "An Incantation of the Sirens: The Structure of Moderato Cantabile," French Review, 48:981-9, May 1975. Developing Nietzsche's study of the ties a- mong music, literature, and culture, Duras concentrates these ties about the dual forces of the "controlled" (moderato) and the "lyric" (cantabile). (J.-L.F.) Heck, Francis, "Dix heures et demie du soir en iti: The Heroine as Artist, a New Dimension," Romance Notes, 26:249-53, Winter 1975. Even though the end result for Maria the artist is failure, "what counts, and what is paramount both for Maria the artist and Maria in love, is that there exists a moment of hope and aspiration which excites and pleases the reader." (J.-L.F.) ELKIN, STANLEY LeClair, Thomas, "The Obsessional Fiction of Stanley Elkin," Contemporary Literature, 16:146-62, Spring 1975. The important qualities of Elkin's fiction are "an imaginative inclusiveness of vision, a hero whose obsessional angle of perception reveals 'the range of the strange' in American life, a psychology that registers dynamic multiplicity and contradiction, an understanding of the way ideas get translated into gestures and actions, a voice to express primal discontents without jargon, a careful attention to the transactions of an individual and the popular culture, a perspective-giving verbal and sit- uational comedy, and an extended rhetorical intensity to express the fullness of his world." (M.P.K.) Sanders, Scott, "An Interview with Stanley Elkin," Contemporary Literature, 16:131-45, Spring 1975. [Elkin discusses his attraction to bizarre char- acter and specific jargon, his reaction to critics, the significance he gives language, his sense of episode over plot, his humor, and his method of working.] (M.P.K.) ETHNIC LITERATURE Pappas, John J., "Women and Men in the Fiction of the New World: A Community of Sufferers," CEA Critic, 37:28-9, May 1975. Ethnic literature depicts the special kind of sacrifice women and men are required to make. Examples of this are the works of Henry Roth, Harry Mark Petrakis, James Baldwin, Paule Marshall, Malamud and Ole R61lvaag.

Ike has been-and is at the time of the story ["Delta Autumn"] metaphorically dead. But this recognition ... leads ... to a re- awakening of our sense of Ike's nobility and a fresh envisioning of ... events solemnized by Ike's Tiresian presence."

Georgia Review, 29:366- 94, Summer 1975. " ... the novel is essentially coherent and its parts self-consistent. ... one who reads with imagination and common sense will find that the novel is not embarrassed by any important self-contradiction." (H.S.) Murray, D. M., "Faulkner, the Silent Com- edies, and the Animated Cartoon," Southern Humanities Review, 9:241-57, Summer 1975. " ... there are particular conventions in Faulkner's humor ['Spotted Horses' (1931), The Hamlet (1940), 'Mule In The Yard' (1934), 'Was,' in Go Down Moses (1942) and 'Shingles For The Lord' (1943)] that closely resemble particular conventions of the funny films. And they were created at the time that the films were being made." (H.S.) Ross, Stephen M., "Shapes of Time and Consciousness in As I Lay Dying," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 16:723-37, Winter 1975. It is unfair to fault Faulkner for hasty, careless shifts in narrative within the novel. Rather, "Faulkner experiments ... with ways of rep- resenting time through grammar." Uncon- ventional changes in verb tense "suggest the infinite variability of human awareness," and indicate character consciousness at a given moment. The Cora-Addie-Whitfield triad is " 'anachronistically' " positioned for dramatic purposes. Tense modulations in Vardaman's monologues "emphasize the boy's obsession with his mother's death."

Richmond, Velma Bourgeois, "Women as Critics: A Look at the Future," CEA Critic, 37:20-2, May 1975. The function of women critics is to provide an alternative system of value, whether needed or heeded, to the prevailing maleness of critical viewpoints, as evidenced in the criticisms of Kate Millett, Germaine Greer and Aileen Kraditor. (T.T.B.) Steeves, Edna L., "The Girl That I Marry: Feminist Stereotypes in Literature," CEA Critic, 37:22-4, May 1975. Feminist critics stress argumentative sexuality as the first means of identifying American novelists, e.g., Mary McCarthy, Ivy Comp- ton-Burnett, Sylvia Plath, Roth, Malamud and Mailer. (T.T.B.) FICTION Cawelti, John G., "The New Mythology of Crime," Boundary 2, 3:325-57, Winter 1975. The development in novels like The Godfather of a "new mythology of crime," which "uses our perennial fascination with criminal activ- ity to work out in stories the tension between traditional values and our sense of the decline of security, significance, and order in the corporate society," expresses a deep uncer- tainty about the ability of traditional social institutions to meet our needs. (D.P.) Lhamon, W. T., Jr., "Break and Enter to Breakaway: Scotching Modernism in the Social Novel of the American Sixties," Boun- dary 2, 3:289-306, Winter 1975. "Self and self-consciousness" came to be felt in Modernist fiction, "against the background of the society, and fully within it"; but a second trend "to form a provisional sense of how selfhood might be outside the society" ac- counts for "a qualitative difference between the fiction of the sixties and the classic modern novel in America." (D.P.) FIEDLER, LESLIE Bluefarb, Sam, "Pictures of the Anti-Stereo- type: Leslie Fiedler's Triptych, The Last Jew in America," CLA Journal, 18:412-31, March 1975. Fiedler's characters, Jewish or Black, are bound together by their separation from the WASP establishment. They are placed in locations far from their "natural" environs yet they continue a search for their old culture and way of life. (T.T.B.) FITZGERALD, F. SCOTT Foster, Richard, "Time's Exile: Dick Diver and the Heroic Idea," Mosaic, 8:89-108, No. 3, Spring 1975. "Dick Diver is a manifestation of the heroic temperament cast in a modern-and thus inevitably American-mold of traditional ide- alism. He is an Apollonian, a potentially tragic hero ... yet born too late-and thus he is an exile."

Olive Garnett's unpublished diary provides new information about events in Ford's life which contribute to The Good Soldier and other earlier fiction. His difficult relationship with Elsie and his nervous breakdown are treated at length by Miss Garnett, "one of the first of Ford's many female literary admirers, and ... a lifelong friend of Elsie's."

FRIEDMAN, BRUCE JAY Lewis, Stuart A., "Rootlessness and Alienation in the Novels of Bruce Jay Friedman," CLA Journal, 18:422-33, March 1975. All Friedman's protagonists are Jewish but none can find any sense of roots either in religion or in ethnic identity. Voyeurism and perversion are the most prevalent forms of sexual expression in his writing. (T.T.B.) FRISCH, MAX Musgrave, Marian E., "Kiirmann, His Wives, and 'Helen the Mulatta' in Max Frisch's Biographie, ein Spiel," CLA Journal, 18:341-7, March 1975.

FROST, ROBERT Borkat, Roberta F. Sarfatt, "The Bleak Land- scape of Robert Frost," Midwest Quarterly, 16:453-67, Summer 1975. A Masque of Reason and A Masque of Mercy reveal Frost's view that God-at best-lacks superhuman perfection and offers man little cause for optimism within a lonely and ter- rifying universe. Much as Frost's doctrine in these poems parodies ancient beliefs, so too his form and tone burlesque the traditional masque. (R.H.A.) GALLEGOS, ROMULO Avendaho, Fausto, "La devoradora de hom- bres, un arquetipo jungiano en la narrativa venezolana," Explicacibn de Textos Literarios, 179-84, 1974/75. Within the framework of Jungian symbology, Dofia BArbara is clearly an anima-figura, in this case, the devourer of men. (C.O.) GARCIA LORCA, FEDERICO Dial, Eleanore Maxwell, "Lorca's Impact in Mexico: 1936 and 1957," Hispan6fila, 53:15-24, Jan. 1975. Lorca's considerable impact has been due to the acting of Margarita Xirgu (in 1936) and to her efforts directing and acting (in 1957) as well as to political matters. (C.O.) McBride, Charles, "The Metropolis and Gar- cia Lorca's Tragic View of Woman," Ro- mance Notes, 26:479-82, Winter 1975. Lorca's stay in New York influenced his later works in the direction of social criticism. It represents not a deviation from its previous outlook but rather a dedication to continuing its expression in dramatic form. (J.-L.F.) GARCIA MARQUEZ, GABRIEL Bolletino, Vincenzo, "El concepto tragico en La hojarasca de Gabriel Garcia MArquez," Hispan6fila, 53:47-59, Jan. 1975. A modern tragedy, one lone man opposes the collective will of society. The result is death without glory for one, helpless rigidity for the other. (C.O.)

Morgan, William A., "La modernidad de Cien a~os de soledad," Explicacibn de Textos Literarios, 3:143-9, 1974/75.

(M.P.K.) GERMAN NOVEL Preisendanz, Wolfgang, "Zum Vorrang des Komischen bei der Darstellung von Geschichtserfahrung in deutschen Ro- manen unserer Zeit," Deutschunterricht, 27:44-54, June 1975. The comical presentation of historical events reflects, as representative passages from novels by Grass, Drach, Janosch and Kempowski illustrate, the unmediated private experience of history ("unmittelbare, private Geschichtser- fahrung") rather than the historian's under- standing of it.

" ... it is perhaps in the character of J&amp;r6me Bardini that we find the clearest expression of the spiritual nihilism which sometimes gives readers of Giraudoux the impression that his work is a sparkling tracery overhanging a void." (D.-J.J.) GOYTISOLO, JUAN Romero, Hector R., "La evoluci6n critico- literaria de Juan Goytisolo," Revista de Estu- dios Hispinicos, 8:323-43, Oct. 1974. At first Goytisolo attempted total objectivity. He soon saw his position as that of writer engagi. His commitment could be both polit- ical-revolutionary or radical-and literary -searching for new forms of expression. (C.O.) Romero, Hector R., "Sehas de identidad: Una nueva etapa en la novelistica de Juan Goytisolo," Hispanbfila, 53:61-71, Jan. 1975. Goytisolo begins a new, fourth, period of production in 1966, a period characterized by the most daring experimentation yet in lan- guage and technique. (C.O.)

HANDKE, PETER Amery, Jean, "Grundloser Ekel," Merkur, 29:468-71, May 1975. "I must wait for more clever people than I am to explain to me why someone had to write a book [Handke's The Hour of True Feeling] which in my opinion is just as literarily successful as it is devoid of humanity." j.R.R.) Goldschmidt, Georges Arthur, "Peter Handke nous importe-t-il?" Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 270:87-93, June 1975. Handke, by his extreme attentiveness, by his simplicity and his rigorous coincidence of words with meaning, presents a radical re- newal of literary expression. His work is not new but is the opposite of the familiar. It belongs to the almost forgotten. (T.T.B.) HEMINGWAY, ERNEST Crozier, Robert D., S.J., "Home James: Hemingway's Jacob," Papers on Language &amp; Literature, 11:293-301, Summer 1975. Hemingway drew on both literary sources (the biblical Jacob and the works of St. John of the Cross) and personal experience (living in the rue Jacob and his leg wound) to formulate the Jacob motif that runs through his works. (W.K.) Hagopian, John V., "Hemingway: Ultimate Exile," Mosaic, 8:77-87, Spring 1975. Hemingway was an exile "from the Catholic God ... from his homeland, from society, from family, and from love" and his style is "a device for the worst kind of exile of all--exile from himself." (C.M.C.) HEYM, GEORG Blunden, Allan, "Notes on Georg Heym's Novelle Der Irre," German Life &amp; Letters, 28:107-19, January 1975.

HIPPIUS, ZINAIDA Pachmuss, Temira, "An Incident of Russian Emigr6 Life in Paris: Zinaida Hippius' Diary of January-May, 1933," Mosaic, 8:139-60, Spring 1975. The diary, printed here in English (introduc- tion and commentary included), "illuminates the poetess' frame of mind, providing deeper insights into her relationship with others and revealing her views on literature, religion, people, and life in general." It deals specif- ically with her relationship with T. I. Manu- khina.

"As Hughes matured as a poet, he became more and more concerned with the limitations of language compared to the range of emotion that could be expressed through music." Lat- er, "Hughes apparently moved away from the problem of the relationship between music and poetry as political conditions drew more and more of his attention .... While much of Langston Hughes's political poetry is ephem- eral, many of his poems are beautifully com- pressed works of art-the result in some cases of forty years of revision." (D.E.P.)

Pomogits, Bela, "Folkl6r es avantgarde az ji magyar k6lt6szetben," Alf6id, 26:46-50, July 1975. The Hungarian avant garde which could surface only after 1957 developed two main streams: one followed the traditions of sur- realism combined with linguistic experimen- tation, the other, nineteenth-century nation- alistic-folklorist classicism and modernism. Accordingly, the free use of metaphor and mythical elements in Laszl6 Nagy's poetry results in the fusion of folklore and surrealism; Ferenc Juhisz has achieved this "Bartokian synthesis" of tradition and modernism by the employment of the paraphrase.

David, "The Search for Agendath Netaim: Some Progress, but No Solution," JamesJoyce Quarterly, 12:251-7, Spring 1975. Joyce took his Zion theme material from printed matter. A Turkish company, "Agudot Neta'im," was organized in Constantinople in 1905; a picture of a model farm in Palestine appeared in the April 2, 1909, issue of Die Welt, the weekly newsletter of the World Zionist Organization. (M.Z.) Day, Robert Adams, "Joyce, Stoom, King Mark: 'Glorious Name of Irish Goose'," James Joyce Quarterly, 12:211-50, Spring 1975. An analysis of a sentence from "Proteus" -"God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed moun- tain"-shows that the images reveal an au- tobiographical myth stretching throughout Joyce's works: God-as-artist becomes domes- ticated man becomes the creative artist-as- God, manipulating a universe of words and people so that he may be betrayed, suffer, and find fulfillment. (M.Z.) Halper, Nathan, "The Grave of Michael Bodkin," James Joyce Quarterly, 12:273-80, Spring 1975. It is not likely that the body of Michael Bodkin is buried in Oughterard, as Ellmann says.

"'Circe' operates as Hamlet's play, 'The Murder of Gonzago,' operates in Hamlet: Joyce employs the themes and images of the famous mousetrap to illuminate his work. 'Circe' is, moreover, the culmination of the Hamlet references and motifs of the novel." (M.Z.) Horia, Vintila, "James Joyce y el sentido de la autoridad," Arbor, 90:201-13, Feb. 1975.

Leithauser, Gladys Garner and Paul Sporn, "Hypsospadia: Linguistic Guidepost to the Themes of the 'Circe' Episode of Ulysses," Journal of Modem Literature, 4:109-14, Sept. 1974. The medical term "hypsospadia," found once in Ulysses, "is a neologism ... . The word not only offers further interesting evidence of Joyce's skill ... in compressing a complex theme into a single metaphor, allusion, or neologism ... but also summarizes what is perhaps the most important theme of the chapter: the evolution of biologically divided men and women into a psychologically and even socially advanced state in which each individual, man or woman, incorporates into the single self the polarities of sexual exis- tence." (D.E.P.) MacNicholas, John, "Joyce contra Wagner," Comparative Drama, 9:29-43, Spring 1975. " ... Joyce's use of Wagner in Exiles ... is an integrating feature of the plot controlling the play's extraordinarily complex tone of char- acterization." "The play discredits Robert Hand's confused and inflamed desire for Bertha by ironic allusions to Wagner ... the German had already dramatized with acute- ness certain destructive tendencies which Joyce recognized in his own personality; and Wagner's art rested upon an heroic vision of the world." (D.E.P.) Rossman, Charles, "Stephen Dedalus' Villa- nelle," James Joyce Quarterly, 12:281-93, Spring 1975. In the villanelle, "there is humor in the way that Joyce, perhaps tolerantly depicting his own youthful excesses and illusions, portrays Stephen's self-deceptions. But there is also pathos in the enormous disparity between intention and fulfillment. To reveal that dis- parity, in fact, is the function of the villa- nelle." (M.Z.)

KALASZ, LASZLO Zimonyi, Zoltan, "'A t6rekeny mindenseg 6r-futaisai'," Tiszathj, 29:66-71, March 1975. Discouraged by the dismal atmosphere of the 1950's, Kalasz left his university studies and returned to his native village to work as a schoolteacher. His poetry reflects his personal life, the alternation between disillusionment and hopelessness, and an ordered relationship with nature and his fellow human beings.

KEROUAC, JACK Dardess, George, "The Logic of Spontaneity: A Reconsideration of Kerouac's Spontane- ous Prose Method," Boundary 2, 3:729-45, Spring 1975. Emerson and Thoreau usually regarded spon- taneous writing as the beginning of a laborious process of revision "in which the initial im- mediacy of thought is strengthened and clar- ified"; but for Kerouac, "the labor precedes and accompanies spontaneous writing," which is "both the final phase and end-product of mental activity rather than its raw material."

Grimstad, Kari, "Karl Kraus and the Prob- lem of Illusion and Reality in Drama and the Theater," Modem Austrian Literature, 8:48-60, Nos. 1-2, 1975. Kraus recognized "that theatrical illusion can be used by playwrights and producers to delude audiences about the nature of reality. As he came to realize that theater-and illusion-were not able to function properly in the corruption of contemporary society, he created a unique podium theater (Theater der Dichtung) from which the light of illusion illumined reality through the word alone." (C.M.C.) Iggers, Wilma A., "Karl Kraus and his Crit- ics," Modem Austrian Literature, 8:26-47, Nos. 1-2, 1975. "Kraus criticism went through two very dis- tinct phases.

Critics have completely ignored the political background of The Plumed Serpent. However, " ... Lawrence was thoroughly familiar with the contemporary political situation in Mexico, and his novel is based on a political reality which the mythology attempts to transcend and redeem."

Witherington, Paul, "Malamud's Allusive De- sign in A New Life," Western American Liter- ature, 10:115-23, Aug. 1975. In A New Life, "Malamud's central archetype ... is not, as some critics have insisted, the imported Fisher King of wasteland literature, but that native hybrid, the American Adam," as is established by allusions to Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Melville. (W.G.F.) MALRAUX, ANDRt Leblon, Jean, and Claude Pichois, "La Con- dition humaine, roman historique?" Revue d'Histoire Littiraire de la France, 75:437-44, Winter 1975.

MANDELSTAM, OSIP Monas, Sidney, "Introduction to Osip Man- delstam's Essays," New Literary History, 6:629-32, Spring 1975. "The poet of APOKA THASTASIS, of rehabil- itation and renewal," Mandelstam viewed past eras as "not merely physical presences but presences in motion." [Followed by reprintings of his essays on Francois Villon, pp. 633-9, and the nineteenth century, pp. 641-6.] (D.P.) MANN, THOMAS Amery, Jean, "Bergwanderung," Merkur, 29:513-27, June 1975. It is hard to write something new for the Thomas Mann centennial. Here we have "quite simply the comments of a reader who for forty-five years has never tired of wander- ing through the magic mountain range" of Mann's oeuvre. (J.R.R.) Gauger, Hans-Martin, "Der Zauberberg--ein linguistischer Roman," Neue Rundschau, 86:217-45, No. 2, 1975. Conversation is central to The Magic Mountain. It also reveals the importance of language in many aspects. Phonetics, foreign languages, the narrator's and the characters' attitudes towards speech, in addition to the way they speak, are all part of the novel's symbolism. Hans Castorp's emancipation can even be traced in the way he develops his own style of speaking. (J.D.B.) Hartung, Rudolf, "Notizen zu Thomas Mann," Neue Rundschau, 86:185-98, No. 2, 1975. [Discussion of various themes in Mann's work and of Mann's relation to the work as an artist.] (J.D.B.) Kern, J. P., "Zur Entstehung des Doktor Faustus," Neue Deutsche Hefte, 22:228-44, No. 2, 1975. " ... one usually must not take Thomas Mann literally and the Entstehung is not a commen- tary to the novel, scarcely a key. It is a supplement." (J.R.R.) Latta, Alan D., "Symbolic Structure: Toward an Understanding of the Structure of Thomas Mann's Zauberberg," Germanic Re- view, 50:34-54, Jan. 1975. The structure of Der Zauberberg is based on an "intricate network of symbolic systems ... which link specific elements of the novel such as figures, objects, landscapes, or actions with abstractions of a higher order." (C.M.C.) Mann, Michael, "Thomas Mann-Zwanzig Jahre Amerika," Neue Rundschau, 86:246-56, No. 2, 1975. More than his social and political conversions, Mann's active fidelity to the German lan- guage and a new inclination to artistic exper- iment were the important fruits of his years in the United States. (J.D.B.) Nixen, Liana De Bona, "The Concept of Barbarism in Thomas Mann's Doctor Faus- tus," Midwest Quarterly, 16:438-52, Summer 1975. "Mann has an ambivalent attitude towards barbarism. He views it as a productive force, an almost necessary evil for the sake of creativity, and a destructive force as a social philosophy." The devil in Doctor Faustus com- bines both the good and bad sides to barba- rism and is allied to the Greeks' Dionysus and Nietzsche's daemon. (R.H.A.) Rieckmann, Jens, "Erl6sung und Beglaubi- gung: Thomas Manns Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen und Ernst Bertrams Nietzsche: Versuch einer Mythologie," MLN, 90:424-30, April 1975. Mann's annotations in the copy of Nietzsche that Bertram gave him in August or Sep- tember 1918 indicate that Mann thought himself to be-as he was in fact-as much the giver as the receiver in the relationship be- tween the two books, "that the book of the artist and that of the scholar completed, redeemed, and confirmed each other." (R.H.L.) Schultz, H. Stefan, "Thomas Mann's Betracht- ungen eines Unpolitischen: Some Observa- tions," MLN, 90:431-47, April 1975. " ... it may well be that the 'morality' of the Betrachtungen has paled with many other things in the course of almost sixty years, but that their artistic cleverness has remained fresh." (R.H.L.) MATUTE, ANA MARIA Flores-Jenkins, Raquel G., "El mundo de los ninos en la obra de Ana Maria Matute," Explicacibn de Textos Literarios, 3:185-90, 1974/75. The children's world is characterized by sol- itude and isolation from the adult world. As they see "reality" more clearly, they will also be leaving the confines of that special world. (C.O.) Ortega, Jose, "La frustraci6n femenina en Los mercaderes de Ana Maria Matute," Hispano- fila, 54:31-8, May 1975. Matute's trilogy explores the destructive ef- fects of Spain's post-1936 repressive society on three women: despair and moral apathy. (C.O.)

MILLER, ARTHUR Gross, Barry, "All My Sons and The Larger Context," Modern Drama, 28:15-27, March 1975. In All My Sons, Miller's preoccupation is with the larger context, the society. However, in the play "the foreground the Keller family occu- pies looms too large, so large as to obliterate any other context which might or should be behind or around it." (P.J.M.) Lowenthal, Laurence D., "Arthur Miller's Incident at Vichy: A Sartrean Interpretation," Modem Drama, 28:29-41, March 1975. " ... no critic has yet pointed out that Vichy is an explicit dramatic rendition of Sartre's treatise on Jews, as well as a clear structural example of Sartre's definition of the existential 'theatre of situation'." (P.J.M.) Overland, Orm, "The Action and Its Signif- icance: Arthur Miller's Struggle With Dra- matic Form," Modem Drama, 28:1-14, March 1975. Throughout his career, Miller has struggled to discover a dramatic form which successfully bridges the split between "the private life of man and his social life." In his return to realistic drama, Miller has found that form. (P.J.M.) MONTHERLANT, HENRY DE Becker, Lucille, "Henry de Montherlant and Suicide," Romance Notes, 26:254-7, Winter 1975. "While his physical deterioration may have been the catalyst for his act, his suicide stemmed from an overwhelming pessimism and nihilism carried to their logical conclu- sion." (J.-L.F.) MYERS, L.H. Grant, R.A.D., "Art versus Ideology: The Case of L.H. Myers," Cambridge Quarterly, 6:214-40, No. 3, 1975. The contemporary failure to recognize the stature of Myers is due to the attack on liberal humanism contained in his best novels. (C.J.B.) NABOKOV, VLADIMIR Appel, Alfred, Jr., "The Road to Lolita, or the Americanization of an tmigre," Journal of Modern Literature, 4:3-31, September 1974. "The product of fourteen years of observation, assimilation, and apprenticeship, the kmigri writer's final citizenship papers, Lolita ... offers a dazzling assemblage of vulgar parts, a culmination of negative images, the movies in particular. The American cinema animates Lolita to the same extent that it forms Lolita and informs Nabokov's moral vision, his cri- tique of mass culture." (D.E.P.) Roth, Phyllis A., "In Search of Aesthetic Bliss: A Rereading of Lolita," College Literature, 2:28-49, Winter, 1975. "In Lolita, Humbert attempts to create and superimpose upon 'reality' a world of his own making to his own taste." (W.G.F.) Stuart, Dabney, "The Novelist's Composure: Speak, Memory as Fiction," Modern Language Quarterly, 36:177-92, June 1975. Speak, Memory is fiction in the sense that it is "imaginative narration in which events, ac- tions, and details of landscape ... are formed, shaped, and rendered significant by a single, ordering consciousness." (G.S.) NIGERIAN LITERATURE Feuser, Willfried F., "A Farewell to the Rising Sun: Post-Civil War Writings from Eastern Nigeria," Books Abroad, 49:40-9, Winter 1975. [A survey of writings by Eastern Nigerian authors published both inside and outside Nigeria from 1970, the year of Biafra's sur- render, to 1974.

O'BRIEN, CONOR CRUISE Cohen, Michael A., "Politics vs. Drama in O'Brien's Murderous Angels," Contemporary Lit- erature, 16:340-52, Summer 1975. Murderous Angels is concerned with the role of Dag Hammarskjold in the downfall of Patrice Lumumba during the Congo crisis of 1960 and 1961. On the one hand the play is a direct portrayal of events "in a didactic and 'factual' spirit and belongs with 'documentary drama' and 'theatre of fact' . . . . On the other, O'Brien seeks to transcend the immediate political context and to foster intrinsic literary interest." (M.P.K.) O'CONNOR, FLANNERY Klevar, Harvey, "Image and Imagination: Flannery O'Connor's Front Page Fiction," Journal of Modem Literature, 4:121-32, Sept. 1974.

In so doing, they substantiate through visual rather than literary evidence the primacy of vision as fiction's base." (H.S.) ORWELL, GEORGE Connors, James, "Zamyatin's We and the Genesis of 1984," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:107-24, Spring 1975. The influence of Zamyatin on 1984 is not nearly as important as has been alleged. "Orwell's vision of the totalitarian state was fully worked out before he read Zamyatin's We." Also, "1984 links up neatly with Orwell's early perceptions of totalitarianism and differs significantly from We in most respects." (S.C.B.) Green, Martin, "Orwell as an Old Etonian," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:3-10, Spring 1975. Eric Blair dismissed his Eton experience as "five years in a lukewarm bath of snobbery" but it seems that these years were important to him in the negative sense that they did not provide stimuli to self-formation. (S.C.B.) Guild, Nicholas, "In Dubious Battle: George Orwell and the Victory of the Money-God," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:49-56, Spring 1975. When Gordon Comstock of Keep the Aspidistra Flying "finally capitulates to the conditions of real life by giving up his war on money, marrying his pregnant mistress, and going back to work for the New Albion Publicity Company," he faces the fact that it is better to be loyal and live in the money world than to cut oneself off from the things that let us know we are alive. (S.C.B.) Knapp, John V., "Dance to a Creepy Minuet: Orwell's Burmese Days, Precursor of Animal Farm," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:11-29, Spring 1975. A realistic reading of Burmese Days is not totally satisfactory because certain "purple passages" seem to take on a fantasy life of their own which is close to the allegorical nature of passages from Animal Farm. (S.C.B.) Meyers, Jeffrey, "George Orwell: A Selected Checklist," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:133-6, Spring 1975. (S.C.B.) Meyers, Jeffrey, "Orwell's Apocalypse: Coming Up for Air," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:69-80, Spring 1975. "Coming Up for Air (1939), Orwell's central transitional work, is both a synthetic and seminal book, gathering the themes that had been explored in the poverty books of the thirties and anticipating the cultural essays and political satires of the next decade." (S.C.B.) New, Melvyn, "Orwell and Antisemitism: Toward 1984," Modern Fiction Studies, 21:81- 105, Spring 1975. "During the war years and those immediately following, Orwell came to understand intellec- tually and, in 1984, artistically, the full mean- ing to the future" of the murder of six million European Jews under Nazism. (S.C.B.) Smyer, Richard I., "Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter: The Flight from History," Modern Fiction Studies, 21:31-47, Spring 1975. Orwell's concept of a downward-and-back- ward spiral movement of modern history ap- pears in this novel in a rudimentary and limited way-"in the form of Mrs. Creevy's harsh authoritarianism and Dorothy's descent into a condition of radically diminished con- sciousness for the purpose of regaining a past at once timeless and free of sexual tensions." (S.C.B.) Van Dellen, Robert J., "George Orwell's Coming Up for Air: The Politics of Powerless- ness," Modem Fiction Studies, 21:57-68, Spring 1975. Orwell's fourth novel offers the beginning of a significantly germane cultural analysis which implies the need to establish a new order because the old is dehumanizing. "The re- sponsibility for change rests with those of us who are moved by the force of his analysis." (S.C.B.) OTERO, BLAS DE Barrow, Geoffrey R., "A Hidden Paradox: Blas de Otero's Historias fingidasy verdaderas," Hispan6fila, 54:39-49, May 1975. Though his first prose work (1970) has some documentary importance as a journal, it is fundamentally inauthentic and fragmented, one more example of traditional liberalism under a capricious censorship. (C.O.) PASKANDI, GEZA Simon, Zoltin, "Pgskindi szinpadi vil.ga," Alfold, 26:57-9, March 1975. In Socialist countries the absurd drama does not portray existential hopelessness but the absurdity of a petit bourgeois mentality. Pis- kindi's dramas analyze the behavior of the oppressed in society because they are the ones who make it possible for an absurd Authority to exist (Kalauz nilkidl). His tragedy, the Ven- digseg, ascertains that it is man's own actions that make the world absurd. (1.0.)

PINTER, HAROLD Groene, Horst, "The Caretaker-Interpre- tationsprobleme bei Pinter," Literatur in Wissenschaft und Unterricht, 8:18-29, April 1975.

PLATH, SYLVIA Balitas, Vincent D., "On Becoming a Witch: A Reading of Sylvia Plath's 'Witch Burn- ing'," Studies in the Humanities, 4:27-30, No. 2, 1975.

PLENZDORF, ULRICH Wapnewski, Peter, "Zweihundert Jahre Wer- thers Leiden," Merkur, 29:530-44, June 1975. The points of contact between Goethe's Wer- ther and Plenzdorf's New Sorrows ... are in- dividually not of great significance but if taken together, the two works tell us much about Goethe's and our own day. (J.R.R.) POETRY Alpert, Barry, "Post-Modern Oral Poetry: Buckminster Fuller, John Cage and David Antin," Boundary 2, 3:653-81, Spring 1975. "Fuller knows that he's making a personal construct of reality but to a greater degree than either Cage or Antin he would attempt to convince humans that his construct is in fact the way things are." (D.P.) POLITICAL DRAMA Kirby, Michael, "On Political Theatre," Dra- ma Review, 19:129-35, June 1975. "Generally, theatre is political only to the extent that it attempts to be political. Most theatre has no concern for or interest in politics." Consciously political theatre, how- ever, can be an important force in political change. (P.J.M.) POUND, EZRA Boyd, Ernest L., "Ezra Pound at Wabash College," Journal of Modernm Literature, 4:43- 54, September 1974. Although Ezra Pound was forced to resign his instructorship at Wabash College for having had a young woman in his rooms overnight, the incident simply culminated a series of irritations and disagreements that would have made his stay at Wabash impossible. (D.E.P.) PROUST, MARCEL Guibertoni, Anna, "Fotografia e aura nella narrativa di Marcel Proust," Rivista di lette- rature moderne e comparate, 28:12-27, March 1975. "In the formation of the Proustian vision of reality the role of photography thus represents an essentially negative term of reference: there can be no art like photography because the task of the artist doesn't consist in copying reality, but in representing it." (J.R.R.) Lapp, John C., "The Jealous Window- Watcher in Zola and Proust," French Studies, 29:166-76, April 1975. "Zola's figures, seen in silhouette and in grotesque movement, like the shadows in Plato's cave, stress the uncertainty of man's concepts, the imperfection of his reason. Swann's controlled visions, though completely dispersed by the dinouement, celebrate, even as they fade from sight, the triumph of the creative mind." (D.-J.J.) Lynn, Th&amp;rese, "The Narrator, Not Marcel: Manuscript Proofs," Romance Notes, 26:258- 61, Winter 1975. Even if Proust did not intend his work to be regarded as an autobiography, the manu- scripts show that he felt the implications of the use of "Marcel," and tried to erase his mis- take. (J.-L.F.) RESISTANCE POETRY Balaschowa, T., "Die Poesie der Resistance," Kunst und Literatur, 23:503-12, May 1975. "There are anniversaries which unleash dis- putes ... . French literature celebrated such an anniversary in 1974, the anniversary of the poetry of the Resistance." [Among the many authors discussed are Seghers, Eluard, Tar- dieu and Gaucheron.] (J.R.R.) RICARDOU, JEAN Saint-Jacques, Denis, "Le Pouvoir du nou- veau roman," L'Esprit Crkateur, 14:304-11, Winter 1974. For Ricardou and Baudry, the new novel is less the writing of an adventure than the adventure of a novel. The critic merely ana- lyzes its procedures. The novel has become a university literature, for without the univer- sities it would not survive.

[Robbe-Grillet discusses the role of the reader or viewer and his own consciousness of the presence of audience, his interest in pop art, especially painting, writers that interest him, his affiliation with the Tel Quel movement, eroticism in his works, and some specific effects in his films and novels, especially Project for a Revolution in New York.] (M.P.K.) ROETHKE, THEODORE Herringhman, Bernard, "Roethke's Poetry: The Forms of Meaning," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 16:568-83, Fall 1974. Certain patterns and correlations between form and meaning in Roethke's works can be agreed on objectively. [The author discusses meter, rhythm, syntax, sound devices, diction, imagery, plot, and revisions in a variety of Roethke's poems.] (R.H.A.) Sullivan, Rosemary, "A Still Center: A Read- ing of Theodore Roethke's 'North American Sequence'," Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 16:765-83, Winter 1975. In the face of the poet's preoccupation "with the fear of death," the "North American Sequence" seems "a penitential act of re- integration with nature ... a poem of age and parting." There is a basic primitivism, purity of image, and a controlled tendency towards formlessness in this celebration of the Amer- ican landscape. Roethke "wants the illusion of Whitman's freshness and informal unselfcon- sciousness ... but with hierarchical and moral values implied." (R.H.A.) ROLLAND, ROMAIN Motyljowa, Tamara, "Romain Rolland an der Wende," Sinn und Form, 27:530-47, May-June 1975.

ROTHENBERG, JEROME Power, Kevin, "Poland/1931," Boundary 2, 3:683-705, Spring 1975. "Poland/1931 is a profoundly Jewish poem, but Rothenberg's exploration of ancestral roots as a means of mapping his own understanding of himself seems ... central to the concerns of both poet and man today ....

The episodic structure of Locus Solus "is such that the chapters could be rearranged without significantly altering either the fiction or the text"; the refusal of the meaning to congeal establishes the reality of the work as "a game," though the term must not be understood to mean "a frivolous or innocuous exercise." (D.P.) ROY, JULES Bosquet, Alain, "Jules Roy, de Bougeaud " Bigeard," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 271:93-5, July 1975.

Sholokhov continues the great classical tra- dition of Russian literature and he, like L. Tolstoy before him, stresses the "national idea." Being truthful to historical reality, and not cutting any corners, Sholokhov let G. Melekhov make his own mistakes, which eventually led the latter to a tragic end. (V.D.) Gura, V.V., "Mir Sholokhova i sovremennyi mir," Voprosy literatury, 18:64-92, April 1975. Sholokhov underscores the idea that the fate of individual man is closely connected with the fate of the nation. Sholokhov's heroes always strive for ideologically sound solutions, since he places them in a historically concrete setting. (V.D.) Kurginyan, M., "Kontseptsiya cheloveka v tvorchestve Sholokhova," Voprosy literatury, 18:93-123, April 1975. Sholokhov's major works such as Silent Don and Virgin Soil Upturned represent a formula- tion of a new epoch stressing profound his- torical and social conditions, which pave the way for a new man and result in a dialectical unity of all his activities.

SOLLERS, PHILIPPE Roudiez, Leon S., "Twelve Points from Tel Quel," L'Esprit Criateur, 14:291-303, Winter 1974. Sollers' concern to present contradictions in Western culture is opposed by Sartre whose commitment to revolutionary politics did not prevent his literary concepts from being rooted in middle class tradition, and by the New Novel group whose revolutionary literary practice coincided with a leftist stance. (T.T.B.) SOLOGUB, FYODOR Brodsky, Patricia Pollock, "Fertile Fields and Poisoned Gardens," Essays in Literature, 1:96-108, Spring 1974. Although thoroughly Sologubian in mood and philosophy, the short story "The Poisoned Garden" was inspired by E. T. A. Hoffmann's "Datura Fastuosa," Alexander Pushkin's poem "Anchar," and Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Rappaccini's Daughter," all of which "share the metaphor of perverted nature as a source of human woe." (W.G.F.) SOLZHENITSYN, ALEXANDER Roberts, Neil, "Solzhenitsyn's Art and Prop- aganda," Cambridge Quarterly, 6:278-92, No. 3, 1975. "I am embarrassed [by The Gulag Archipelago] not because I wish [Solzhenitsyn's] attitude to Marxism were other than it is but because the great novelist I believe him to be is, needless to say, not a propagandist or a rhetorician .... Moreover, I don't think his main importance rests on the justice or otherwise of his criticism of Soviet society." (JU.R.R.) SPANISH POETRY Marin, Diego, "El paisaje urbano en la poesia espaiiola de hoy," Revista de Estudios Hispaini- cos, 8:437-72, Oct. 1974. The urban scene in today's poetry tends to be impressionistic and synthetic and charged with a strong emotional note. Though it is highly subjective, there is little attempt to humanize inanimate objects. (C.O.) STEAD, C. K. Robertson, R.T., "The Nightmare of Kiwi Joe: C.K. Stead's Double Novel," Ariel, 6:97-110, Spring 1975. Stead's Smith's Dream reflects the fear that New Zealand could become part of the "pattern of large-power mutilation of a small country." (C.J.B.) STEGNER, WALLACE Peterson, Audrey C., "Narrative Voice in Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose," Western American Literature, 10:125-33, Aug. 1975. The narrative voice of Lyman Ward is able to preside over and control this novel, enriching it rather than intruding, and "engaging in manipulative strategies without apparent loss of credibility," because Ward is "so believable that the reader comes to accept whatever conventions he dictates."

"The cluster of images identified and empha- sized by the prosodic structure suggests an ironic contradiction to the speaker's statement of rejection and anticipation." Stevens also "composes" certain intricate and less obvious sound patterns, separate from structure of meaning, which serve primarily to please the ear. (R.H.A.) Zukovsky, Louis, "Addenda to Prepositions: The Collected Critical Essays: For Wallace Stevens," Journal of Modern Literature, 4:91- 108, September 1974. "In his poems Stevens exists as the many- worded faculties of a body ... : that is, all his poems affect being involved in the old phil- osophical bugbear of a theory of knowledge, a question as to what ... 'really' exists. To be sure his most often gay, lovely skepticism doubts its own skepticism ....." (D.E.P.) STRUCTURALISM De Lauretis, Teresa, "The Shape of the World: Report on Structuralism and Semi- otics in Italy," Books Abroad, 49:227-32, Spring 1975. The First Congress of the International As- sociation for Semiotic Studies (IASS) held in Milan in June 1974 signals the turn in Italy from structuralism to a more historical ap- proach to literature. Structuralism "which had come to connote a rigid non-dialectic view of the ideological object" has been aban- doned "in favor of the more comprehensive and flexible term 'semiotic' or 'semiological' criticism, which by denoting a process implies the co-presence not only of effect and subject, but of the world (i.e., history) as well." (M.P.K.) Glowinski, Michal, "Polish Structuralism," Books Abroad, 49:239-43, Spring 1975. [Historical overview of the development of structuralism in Poland in the 20th century, with particular emphasis on structuralism as a process oriented approach to literature and on the literary work as social fact, not self- contained entity.] (M.P.K.) Hermand, Jost, "French Structuralism from a German Point of View," Books Abroad, 49:213-21, Spring 1975. The appeal of structuralism to traditionalists and die-hard esthetes in West Germany is based upon its apparent objectivity and free- dom from political affiliations. But structural- ism in fact "reveals itself as just another stage in the decline of the bourgeois system of thought ... ." In its allegiance to an ahistori- cal structuralism, "the bourgeois class gives up all commitment to progressive change and insistence on the rights of the individual. There remains only a faddish, blase pessimism . " (M.P.K.) Ingwersen, Niels, "The Impact of Structural- ism on Danish Criticism," Books Abroad, 49:221-6, Spring 1975. The "emergence of structuralist criticism and its 'successor,' ideological criticism on a neo- Marxist basis" has made literary criticism in Denmark more thought-provoking and searching. The critical debate is reflected in university teaching and in two journals, Poetik, which encourages an ideological approach to literature, and Kritik, "which can be said to 'protect' the humanistic, individualistic tra- dition against the onslaught of the neo-Marx- ists." (M.P.K.) Mitchell, Bonner, "The French Quarrel over Structuralism and a Parallel of Sixty Years Ago," Books Abroad, 49:199-204, Spring 1975. The attacks upon Sorbonne professor Gustave Lanson and his disciples by conservative men of letters in the pre-World War I years can be studied as a precedent to the attacks in the 1960s on structuralists, notably Roland Barthes, by Raymond Picard. (M.P.K.) Patzig, Giinther, "Der Strukturalismus and seine Grenzen," Neue Deutsche Hefte, 22:247-66, No. 2, 1975. "It seems sensible ... to say whereof that which is characteristic of the structuralist approach actually consists; then we wish to discuss the question whether the concept of structuralism is philosophically original or ... can be traced far back into the history of Western thought ... . Finally we want ... to determine more precisely the breadth and boundaries" of structuralism. (.R.R.) Roudiez, Leon S., "With and Beyond Literary Structuralism," Books Abroad, 49:204-12, Spring 1975. Structuralist criticism claims that the latent structure of a work can be revealed in an objective and rational way. But the claim of objectivity is in fact part of a conservative political ideology that uses language structures to define "reality" as ahistorical and scientifi- cally pure. The writings of Philippe Sollers and Julia Kristeva point toward a textual theory that transcends the historically limited and socially coded structuralist concept of literature. (M.P.K.) Thompson, Ewa M., "Russian Structuralist Theory," Books Abroad, 49:232-8, Spring 1975. [A summary of the basic theories of structural- ist or semiotic studies in Russia as compared to Western semiotic studies.] (M.P.K.) 476</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY TODOROV, TZVETAN Champagne, Roland A., "The Spiralling Dis- cours: Todorov's Model for a Narratology in Les Liaisons dangereuses," L'Esprit Criateur, 14:342-52, Winter 1974. For Todorov epistolary technique is unique, portraying through language a circular rap- port between sender and recipient. It is the performing self, and words are acts, drama- tizing the plot of the story in multidimensional fashion, even though fragmentary and episod- ic. (T.T.B.) TOURNIER, MICHEL Bosquet, Alain, "Michel Tournier et les mythes renouvels," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 270:82-6, June 1975. Tournier is the most complex and most orig- inal novelist of his generation. His work involves an intermittent autobiographical temptation, a mythical feature and a cosmic religiosity. (T.T.B.) UNAMUNO, MIGUEL DE Deibe, C. Feal, "Fedra en la obra de Una- muno," Revue de Littirature Comparke, 49:19- 27, Jan.-March 1975. Although inspired by Euripides and Racine, Unamuno greatly differs from them: the in- cestuous love is attributed to the mother and, in his fantasy, the orphan Unamuno recovers the father desperately sought. (J.-L.F.) Fox, Arturo A., "Caracterizaci6n y drama- tismo narrativo de Unamuno," Revista de Estudios Hispinicos, 8:419-35, Oct. 1974. The static archetype, the lack of autonomy, is far from being objectionable in absolute terms; the problem is, do these characters adequately serve the function intended for them by their creator. (C.O.) UPDIKE, JOHN Vanderwerken, David L., "Rabbit 'Re-docks': Updike's Inner Space Odyssey," College Lit- erature, 2:73-8, Winter 1975. "One of the most striking aspects" of Rabbit Redux is Updike's use of the Apollo 11 moon shot to provide "a congenial set of words, images and metaphors to control and unify a novel which continually seems on the verge of getting out of hand." (W.G.F.) VACULIK, LUDViK Eagle, Herbert, "Ludvik Vaculik's The Axe: A Quest for Human Dignity," Books Abroad, 49:7-12, Winter 1975. Vaculik's attack on the Communist party in 1967 led to his subsequent ejection from the party. His novel, The Axe, whose plot often parallels his life and that of his father, is "a transmutation into art of the moral and philosophical struggle which had plagued Czechoslovaks to good conscience for twenty years." (M.P.K.) VALURY, PAUL Lawler, James R., "Val6ry's 'Un Feu Distinct ... '," French Studies, 28:169-76, April 1974. "Un Feu Distinct ... " is probably not "a direct outgrowth of the Cahiers of two separate periods, the late 90's and Val6ry's so-called return to poetry." It was probably written earlier, the product of fusion of form and matter as opposed to accretion. (D.-J.J.) VALLE-INCLAN, RAMON MARIA DEL Ling, David, "Human Dignity and Passions in Valle-Inclin's Retablo de la avaricia, la lujuriay la muerte," Revista de Estudios Hispinicos, 8:271-300, May 1974. In these four one-act plays from the 20's, Valle-Inclan turns from the violent farce of his esperpentos in an attempt to re-create every genuine human emotion. He sees the need to confirm characters of individual worth and dignity. (C.O.) Lyon, J. E., "La media noche: Valle-Inclin at the Crossroads," Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, 52:135-421, April 1975. Valle's front-line war reports, published in 1916 and 1917, have been considered keys to his transition from a heroic to an antiheroic vision of life. Careful attention to this front- line war reportage suggests that the experience was not the key to his later anti-heroic vision of life. He began the venture with pre-conceived ideas and did not allow himself to be trauma- tized. (C.O.) VITTORINI, ELIO Potter, Joy Hambuechen, "An Ideological Substructure in Conversazione in Sicilia," Ita- lica, 52:50-69, Spring 1975. "It is my contention ... that on one level Conversazione was meant as an essay on revo- lution ... and that a correct interpretation of the fourth part of the book ... shows it to be the central episode in this study ...." (J.R.R.) Shapiro, Marianne, "The Gran Lombardo: Vit- torini and Dante," Italica, 52:70-7, Spring 1975. "It will be my aim here to shed some addi- tional light on the Gran Lombardo in Vitto- rini's novel [Conversazione in Sicilia] and to demonstrate his function as a crucial link between Silvestro and a transient series of father-figures; and between Vittorini and Dante."

"To the extent that Brideshead is still regularly misread, one must concede that Waugh is at fault .... When M.G.M. discovered that [it] was not a love story after all ... the deal collapsed." (J.R.R.) WESKER, ARNOLD Mannheimer, Monica Lauritzen, "Ordering Chaos: The Genesis of Arnold Wesker's The Friends," English Studies, 56:34-44, Feb. 1975. "The play went through no less than six drafts ... a comparison between them ... brings out features in this play that are more or less characteristic of his dramatic work as a whole." (J.R.R.) WHARTON, EDITH Tintner, Adeline R., "'The Hermit and the Wild Woman': Edith Wharton's 'Fiction- ing' of Henry James," Journal of Modern Literature, 4:32-42, Sept. 1974. Although it has been shown "that Henry James disguised Edith Wharton as the scrib- bling Princess in his mock epic, 'The Velvet Glove,' ... it has not been recognized ... that Edith Wharton had also disguised Henry James in her pseudo-life of a saint, 'The Hermit and the Wild Woman,' 1906 ... and in her imitation medieval poem, 'Ogrin the Hermit,' 1909." (D.E.P.) WILLIAMS, WILLIAM CARLOS Bollard, Margaret Lloyd, "The 'Newspaper Landscape' of Williams' Paterson," Contem- porary Literature, 16:317-27, Summer 1975. "Williams' sense of a connection between the daily newspaper and what he maintains the new modern poem should be, involves three interrelated" ideas that culminate in Paterson: a poem should use the same materials as newspapers, that is, facts; a poem not only reports, but makes news; and the method of composition, a mosaic juxtaposition of het- erogeneous items, is much like a newspaper's. (M.P.K.) WITTGENSTEIN, LUDWIG Abrams, M. H., "A Note on Wittgenstein and Literary Criticism," ELH, 41:541-54, Win- ter 1974. [A complex article in four parts discussing the bearing of Wittgenstein's later philosophy on literary criticism and then Abrams' own views with respect to truth and subjectivity in aes- thetic criticism.] (S.C.B.) WOLF, CHRISTA Korff, F. W., "Assoziationen zu Christa Wolf," Neue Deutsche Hefte, 22:327-30, No. 2, 1975. "She seems to be a woman with sharp elbows, defensive to the point of radical subjectivity .... I believe that the secret of her authority is territorial defense." (J.R.R.) WOUK, HERMAN Bolton, Richard R., "The Winds of War and Wouk's Wish for the World," Midwest Quar- terly, 16:389-408, Summer 1975. Seen as "a historical romance, with a didactic purpose," the novel invites a broad readership to admire Victor Henry, perceive basic causes of war and other human cruelty, and better appreciate the military's value, while simul- taneously enjoying a good story. "There are ... none of the features which might have endeared such a book to academics, while restricting its sales." (R.H.A.) ZUKOVSKY, LOUIS Carruth, Hayden, "The Only Way to Get There from Here," Journal of Modern Liter- ature, 4:88-90, September 1974. Zukovsky has "verbosity here, attenuation there ... . But of all timers, old and new, he has one virtue in greatest degree, that all his words inhere, all, within one another's mean- ing, conforming centrally to the unsayable." (D.E.P.) Yannella, Philip R., "On Louis Zukovsky," Journal of Modern Literature, 4:74-87, Sep- tember 1974. Zukovsky, little recognized by critics, has been a major influence on the work of modern poets. "To a great degree, his work is an extension and deepening of the chief tenden- cies of twentieth century poetry. To an equal degree, though, his work reveals ... a cen- tripetal thrust which consolidates aesthetic/ moral value in home and family ... . The special yield of Zukovsky is a poetry of grace and harmony ... . As much as his love of poetry, his absorption of musical theory and modern science marks him as a distinctive voice."
