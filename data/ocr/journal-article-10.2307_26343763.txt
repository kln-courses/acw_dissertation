<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> PERSPECTIVES ON TERRORISM Volume 12, Issue 1 he was always ambivalent about jihadism as warfare, which enabled him to become the only Palestinian leader  at the time to agree to far-reaching concessions as part of a political settlement with Israel. This was due, the  author explains, because the “big jihad” (also termed the “peace of the brave”) of establishing a Palestinian state  was preferable to the “small jihad” of armed struggle. Despite these important accomplishments, the author  concludes, Arafat’s tragic failure was his over-use of religious symbolism, which caused him to fail in his tran- sition from a leader of a national liberation movement, who can afford to use such symbolism, to the different  requirements a leader of a state, who had “difficulty distinguishing between dream and reality, and remained  a prisoner of symbols that excited the masses instead of agreeing to receive part of the Palestinian nation on  which he had dreamed.” (p. 220). Hopefully the academic and practitioner insights shaping Arafat’s political  biography (which also affect many of the Palestinians’ current leaders) that are presented in this important  book, which currently is only available in its Hebrew edition, will eventually be available in an English-lan- guage publication. The author, a retired analyst on Palestinian affairs in Israeli intelligence services, teaches at  Haifa University and other educational institutions.

The contributors to this edited volume examine the impact of the convergence of the disparate threats of ter- rorism, criminality, corrupt economies, exploitation of cyberspace for illicit purposes, and other problem areas  in producing a “global crisis of governance.” To examine these issues, the book is divided into four sections: I.  “Slouching Toward Dystopia” (e.g., the global crisis of governance, how “plutocrats and criminals” are challeng- ing the Westphalian State, the nature of the revolution introduced by the Islamic State, the volatility of financial  markets); II. “One Network” (e.g., the dynamics of cooperation between terrorists and criminal organizations,  Hizballah’s criminal networks, and how the Islamic State has created an organizational base for its survival); III.  “Pandora” (e.g., the exploitation of social media in a “hyper-connected world,” the intersection of protection  economics, financial flows, and violence, illicit trade; and the evolution of cybercrime); and IV. “A Toolbox for  the 21st Century” (e.g., frameworks to facilitate cooperation among countries, countering the convergence of  illicit networks through public-private partnerships, adapting to the new battlefield against asymmetric ac- tors “who do not play by the Clausewitzian rule book” (p. 354) and whose information operations need to be  countered strategically, and the need by governments for a network-of-networks to counter their asymmetric  adversaries’ own networks). As this volume was produced by a defense university, it would have been useful  for the editors to have added a concluding chapter to summarize the contributors’ findings into a single tool kit  to enable military campaign planners and action officers to see how the convergence of these disparate threats  might play out in the foreign operational environments in which they operate.   Gerry Nagtzaam, From Environmental Action to Ecoterrorism? Towards a Process Theory of Environmental and  Animal Rights Oriented Political Violence (Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2017), 368 pp., $ US  135.00 [Hardcover], ISBN: 978-1-8498-0119-5. This book attempts to use the case of eco-terrorists to examine the various trigger points for moving from one  stage of radicalism to the next, how they select their targets for attack, and the likelihood for an escalation in  their environmental political action if “ecological consciousness” becomes widespread among a larger public.  The account primarily focuses on eco-militant organizations and groups in three countries: the United States,  the United Kingdom, and Australia. To examine these issues, the author discusses how to define terrorism; the  categories of left-wing/right-wing and “special interest” terrorist groups; defining eco-terrorism; and examines  whether “ecotage” violence in destroying property qualifies as a terrorist act. Also interesting is the discussion  of leading theories to explain the process of radicalization, especially Ehud Sprinzak’s delegitimization theory,  ISSN  2334-3745 108 February 2018 </page> <page sequence="2"> PERSPECTIVES ON TERRORISM Volume 12, Issue 1 which consists of a crisis of confidence stage, a conflict of legitimacy stage, an upswing in political action (i.e.  violence) stage, and the final stage, the crisis of legitimacy, in which the activists make a complete transfor- mation into violence. This theory is then applied by the author to examine whether and how the eco-militant  organizations and groups followed the Sprinzak trajectory into violence. To examine this thesis, following the  introductory overview, the book discusses the nature and trajectories of groups such as the Animal Liberation  Front, Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The author con- cludes that “While time will tell if Sprinzak’s conception of political violence is correct and ecoterrorist groups  will progress to the third ‘crisis of legitimacy’ stage, with the exception of the ALF there appears little evidence  to date that the groups examined, except in isolated instances, have reached that threshold.” (p. 308). He ends  the book on a warning note that if these activists perceive an imminent “global environmental catastrophe or a  perception that the problem of anthropomorphic climate change is not being suitably addressed, and despair- ing of mainstream political solutions, they may choose to adopt violence against fellow humans as a legitimate  tactic.” (p. 308). This book is an important contribution to the literature on eco-terrorism and the application  of radicalization theories to explaining possible trajectories into violence.

Nielsen, Deadly Clerics: Blocked Ambition and the Paths to Jihad (New York, NY: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 2017), pp., US $ 94.99 [Hardcover], US $ 29.99 [Paperback], ISBN: 978-1-1084-0405-1. This account explores the academic culture of jihadist clerics in general, and the factors that drive them to turn  to such a religiously extremist theology at early points in their careers. To explain their pathway to becoming  leading advocates of extremist violence, the author tests the hypothesis, which is adapted from Ted Robert  Gurr’s notion of “relative deprivation,” that, for clerics turned jihadists, the mechanism of blocked academic  ambition early on in their careers within established Muslim religious institutions plays a major role in their  adopting militant jihadism. As the author writes in the book’s blurb, which well summarizes his argument,  “As long as clerics’ academic ambitions remain attainable, they are unlikely to espouse violent jihad. Clerics  who are forced out of academia are more likely to turn to jihad for two reasons: jihadist ideas are attractive  to those who see the system as turning against them, and preaching a jihad ideology can help these outsider  clerics attract supporters and funds.” To test this hypothesis, the author utilizes evidence from sources such as  large-scale statistical analysis of texts and network data obtained from the Internet, case studies of clerics’ lives,  and ethnographic participant observations at sites in Cairo, Egypt. Despite the book’s excellent application of  qualitative and quantitative methodologies to generate new findings, the author’s thesis can be questioned,  since it ignores the fact that some of the clerics under examination may have been blocked academically due to  their own professional shortcomings and that their turn to jihadist militancy was due to their susceptibility to  be drawn to extremism in the form of such imperialistic ideologies to begin with. The author’s conclusion can  also be questioned as utopian when he writes that a successful counter-radicalization program should be based  on co-opting such extremist-inclined clerics as opposed to arresting and imprisoning them, since it would pro- vide them “with access to better educational networks and, ultimately, the possibility for fulfilling and secure  career prospects.” (p. 177). The book’s appendices include valuable syllabi of instructional materials on jihadi  theology and the methodology used by the author to conduct his empirical research.

This is an important selection of writings by leading anarchist theorists over the past 150 years. As explained  by the volume’s original editor, anarchists believe “in a society in which all individuals can do whatever they  choose, except interfere with the ability of other individuals to do what they choose. This ideal is called anarchy,  from the Greek anarchia, meaning absence of government” (p. 2). Besides this meaning, anarchy “is also used  to mean unsettled government, disorderly government, or government at its crudest in the form of intimida- ISSN  2334-3745 109 February 2018 </page> </plain_text>
