<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMBOLISM AND MEDIATION IN ARNIM'S VIEW OF ROMANTIC PHANTASY ROLAND HOERMANN University of California, Davis I. Structural Aspects The role of phantasy in Achim von Arnim's view of reality was conditioned by two characteristically Romantic beliefs. The first of these asserts that religious or existential reality is composed of a rational dimension and of an imaginative dimension. Arnim (1781-1831) asso- ciated the rational factor with the physical world of sensory phenomena, while identifying the imaginative dimension with man's aesthetic, inner life. Although careful to specify that isolated phantasy is a meaningless virtue, he clearly felt that aesthetic reality represents the higher plane of being. 1 Indeed, for a typical Romanticist like Arnim, phantasy was nothing less than the power to perceive the supreme level of truth - a view which coincides essentially with Wackenroder's earlier discovery of a religious element as the common denominator of all great imagina- tive art. The tension implicit between reality's physical axis and its imaginative dimension represents Arnim's particular concern within the larger, idealistic complex of Romantic dualism. The second fundamental belief that gave shape to Arnim's view of Romantic phantasy asserts the importance of a mediator figure as the synthesizing reconciler between the material and the ideological poles of reality. As might be expected, the mythology of Christian idealism reappears in German Romanticism as an aesthetic pattern, with the medie- val Holy Mother's role of the personal intercessor mirrored in Arnim's feminine characterization of Romantic Phantasy, and with the Christian Saviour's ethically reforming mediation reflected in the messianic, cul- tural role of the fanciful poet. Hence Arnim's veiled embodiments of Romantic Phantasy usually accomplish their mediation between the searching artist-to-be and the sought-after imaginative reality by means of personal, womanly inspiration. His gaining of the imaginative per- ception of physical reality manifests itself in turn when the fanciful poet enters into the sacrifice of becoming a mediator between the in- habitants of the prosaic world, on the one hand, and the poetical mys- teries of his mistress' realm, on the other. Like the qualifying premise of a syllogistic triad, the Christian affirmation here of a harmonizing mediation originates in the classical first statement of reality's dissonance. The pre-Hegelian resolution of these divergent premises then asserts a newly synthesized reality, based on Romanticism's new way of seeing the entire natural world as a con-</page><page sequence="2">202 Monatshefte tinuous mythological revelation of interrelated life-forces. A passage in the phantastic tale of Die Majoratsherren (1820) demonstrates in a par- ticularly fruitful way how Arnim - acting as a poetic mediator himself - reconciles his belief in a split reality withl his .concept of a reunifying mediator. The climactic setting for this characterization is the poetical hero's vision experienced from his prophetic garret vantage. In the course of this split-level perceptual experience, which simultaneously in- volves the realities of phantasy and of the material world, the hero wit- nesses his beloved Esther's death struggle and watches her purified spirit ascending to the higher sphere of being: "Throughout the structure of this world, a higher realm became visible which the senses can per- ceive only through the imagination: through that phantasy which - by materializing these higher ideas - stands between the two realms as a mediator and always ideates anew the dead shell of matter into living form." 2 In this key passage Arnim asserts the existence of a higher realm of ideas (to which Esther's liberated spirit is returning) and of a ma- terial world of objects (in which the title hero is still enmeshed). The mediating spirit of phantasy has afforded both unhappy protagonists a vision of that pure realm in which their thwarted union may occur. This prophetic view, perceived by a hero and heroine still inhabiting the material world, exists on the level of symbolical reality which phan- tasy creates by rendering the spiritual idea visible within the material object. In such a manner, Romantic phantasy sublimates man's schizoid perception of 'total reality by affirming a symbolical world of art forms, in which ideated matter and materialized idea are reunified as a single existential entity. 3 Clearly, then, this passage forms a crucial part of Arnim's concept of the poetic symbol, the aesthetic or "living" formu- lation of total, religious reality. The twin relationship between matter and idea in Arnim's view of poetic phantasy is also illustrated by Klelie's experience of "Waldeinsam- keit" in the novelette Die Kirchenordnung (1822). While watching the motion of the lofty Atree tops, she sees every branch above her outlined by its ethereal double, clearly in the relationship of symbolizing object to symbolized idea. The nebulous aura which Klelie sees surrounding each forest shape carries on, we are told, a secret life with the sun and clouds in the higher sphere of existence (IX, 191). Leaving external considerations momentarily in favor of structural aspects in the previously cited key passage of Arnim's Die Majoratsher- ren, we find further indications that the symbolical device itself attests to Phantasy's perceptual resynthesis of our world's split reality. With the author's reference here to a figure standing as a mediator between the two domains of material and ideological reality, he has in effect created an image of Poetic Phantasy to symbolize this very symbolizing activity. In so doing, Arnim acts in the role of mediator himself and is employing essentially those same principles of mediation or symbol creationr which he is defining. This uniquely Romantic circularity is il-</page><page sequence="3">Arnim 203 lustrated narratively in the same story, where the hero's second pair of eyes symbolize poetic phantasy as they mediate for him the spiritualiza- tion of rational, everyday objects (II, 204, 208). By perceiving, for example, the maid-servant's headcloth throughout as a halo, the hero's second set of eyes enables him to discern the true, essential goodness beneath Beatrice's gruff exterior. Hence these symbolic and, at the same time, symbolizing eyes reinterpret the surface reality of the ser- vant's prosaic headcloth by creating from it the poetic symbol of a halo to express Beatrice's inner character. Indeed, the Majoratherr him- self represents the epitome of the Romantic artist as an emblematizing formulator of ideas. The organic and perhaps unconscious unity of the key passage we have been examining in such detail suggests that the creating of sym- bolic images was for Arnim the primary, if not exclusive, role of the creative imagination and hence became also the very basis of his own poetic style. The examples selected, showing different degrees of con- cretization in the author's treatment of the phantasy concept, range through reality's spectrum from the explanatory, ideological pole (key passage above) to the opposite, material zone (the Majoratherr's second set of eyes) and into the reconciling area of aesthetic values with the symbolic figure of Phantasy itself as an intercessor. In illustrating Ar- nim's formulation of the phantasy idea, we have been concerned pri- marily and necessarily with that force in the symbolical process which can be termed materialization. The complementary but opposite force of ideation can be demonstrated as a simultaneous phenomenon in Ar- nim's most unified and unifying emblem for the poet, namely in his plowman-sower figure. Because this cumulative image also reveals the embryonic point in Arnim's elaboration of the aesthetic myth of the artist's salvation, for which phantasy's mediation is crucial, reference here to the plowman-sower image will be especially instructive. The nature of this image is most evident in the author's preface to his most important novel, Die Kronenwachter (I8I7 ff.). Here Arnim visualizes the poet as a worker in the intellectual fields whose unwilling plowshare (the poet's quill) scratches and labors across the white ex- panse to be sown (III, 5, 8). Describing his research for Des Knaben Wunderhorn (8o05 ff.) in various libraries, Arnim writes to Clemens Brentano that for two days he has been plowing the white field from dawn till dusk (Steig, I, 149), and four years later, in a letter to Bet- tina, he speaks of driving his plowshare over a burned-out city of first drafts (Steig, II, 247). In this way Arnim literally and overtly em- bodies the idea of the poet's struggle for imaginative fulfillment into the concrete activity of the plowman-sower, who prepares the earth for acceptance of the seed he is to sow for the enrichment of mankind. The reciprocal and simultaneous aspect of ideation in this total emblem predominates in the appearance of the title hero in Juvenis (18I8) as a plowman-sower, whose meals are brought to the fields by</page><page sequence="4">204 Monatshefte a Tyrolean maiden (Phantasy). The context suggests that these repasts represent pictorial illustrations, i. e. images, for the poet's works. Fur- thermore, the springtime climax to Juvenis' labors on the land and to his love reveals the importance of this season as a Romantic motif rep- resenting the artist's winning of the imaginative perception as well as signifying the coming golden age of poetry." Thus Arnim ideates Juvenis' plowman-sower activity and his love for a Tyrolienne by for- mulating them in the light of the poet's creative deeds and their acti- vation by an inspiring phantasy. By means of this two-fold, conscious technique, Arnim is - perhaps unconsciously - also contributing to the generalized plowman myth, in which he was preceded most directly by William Langland (The Visions of Piers the Plowman, 1362) and by Johann von Saaz (Der Ackermann aZts Bohmen, 1400). From this demonstration of the literary phenomenon of simultaneous embodiment and ideation, it is apparent that the universal "idea" of poetic creativeness and the finite "body" of the plowman image not only become inseparable aspects but undergo progressive interpenetration of meaning, as Arnim's symbolic equation in any particular work be- comes increasingly clear to the reader. It is just as impossible to iso- late these two reciprocal forces that together generate symbolical reality as it is to separate that "phantastic" second eyesight from the person of the Majoratherr or indeed to divorce the mediating spirit of phantasy from the poet-mediator figure. To be sure, the clearest separation in the purely narrative function of the latter two figures occurs in those works that most explicitly demonstrate the Romantic myth of the ar- tist's salvation. This myth's entire ethos turns on the dualistic but nar- rowing gulf between inspiring Phantasy and the aspiring novice and on that eventual union which represents his gaining of the imaginative vi- sion. Therefore, during the poet-novice's transition from the bourgeois world to the aesthetic, both the materializing force and - to the extent that Phantasy's activities further inform her own individuation - the ideational force are personified in her single figure and character role. 6 Viewed, however, from the broader philosophic premise of the com- pleted, symbolical work of art (i. e. aesthetic reality), the mortal poet's achievement necessarily proceeds from his world of material reality, which he transforms chiefly via the principle of ideation. For the poet is ultimately concerned with injecting universal, intellectual content into the chaos of finite forms or "pictorial illustrations" surrounding him. The spirit of phantasy, on the other hand, must proceed from its own infinite world of spiritual or ideological reality, which it translates via the materializing principle into that disconnected reality of humanly discernible forms. Phantasy's protean climax to these revelationary in- dividuations is the successive personifying of its own, goddess-like self, one moment in the embodiment of Arnim's Tyrolienne and the next moment as the gypsy princess in his Isabella von Agypten (18 In this way, the creative process as well as the symbolical work of</page><page sequence="5">Amrnim 205 art may be viewed as a double phenomenon, with the ideating poet in a reciprocal relationship to that materializing power of phantasy which exerts itself through him. Both component tensions - the ideating and the embodying force - are as essential for the imaginative work of art as are centrifugal and centripetal motion for the dynamic serenity of their common center. As a result, it is not surprising to find Arnim also employing the image of the perfect work of art (IV, 383) or the irre- ducible emblem of the paradisiacal child c to represent the union of Phantasy and poet as an absolute state of harmonious equilibrium. Thus even the ultimate mechanics of the Romantic poet's symbolical style demonstrate the same initially assumed polarity between physical and ideological reality, together with the reconciling, aesthetic principle of mediation. II. Narrative Aspects Because the mediating concept of phantasy is crucial to Romanti- cism's idealist concern for the artist's salvation within a dual reality as well as being decisive in the very mode of Romantic thinking and writ- ing, as just demonstrated, it actually assumes the significance of an anthropomorphic "Ursymbol" in the Romantic existential posture. The powerful center of diffusion for the Phantasy image was Novalis' "Klingsohr's Tale" in Heinrich von Ofterdingen (1802), where Phantasy (Ginnistan) mediates Eros' rejuvenation and acts as nurse to the para- disiacal child Fabel, whose activation of a springtime golden age of "Universalpoesie" prefigures the artist's destiny. During his early period, however, when Arnim had strong doubts regarding Novalis' "magic idealism" (Steig I, 41), he was more impressed by the dualist formula- tions of Schelling, his former teacher in Jena, whose nature philosophy stressed a primal masculine-feminine dichotomy. Thus, in a novelette conceived about I803, Die Ehenschmiede (publ. posth. 1839), Arnim's portrayal of Aura Luft can be interpreted as a generalized personifica- tion of the feminine principle in terms of the fig-ure of Romantic Phantasy. Here, mediating Phantasy inspires mere inartistic citizens, ultimately unifying life's feminine and masculine polarity in the form of a quadruple wedding. Significantly, this gay daughter of a German professor is an early orphan - one of Romanticism's emblems for the outsider whose destiny transcends the rationale of bourgeois normalcy. From the inter- nal narrator's account of her, it is evident that Arnim subordinates here the one rational and masculine principle of the ideating organization of matter to the other materializing, feminine principle of protean individua- tion, for Aura is characterized as "the fleeting, nimble, and irresponsible maiden, who check-mated me with all my philosophy" (II, 18). The raconteur, who is also the butt of Aura's humor, is thankful for his sound constitution, since "an abundance of insolent strength and health permitted the pretty girl to engage in all sorts of amusement that would have driven a person of weak nerves to despair" (II, 25). In the artisan</page><page sequence="6">206 Monatshefte Rennwagen's analysis of this goddess-like creature the reader discerns Amrnim the poet, celebrating and yet lamenting the elusive, quicksilvery force of phantasy: Whenever I look completely objectively at Aura's form, if I - as a sculptor - compare her to the finest statues, if I compare the color of her skin with the best of Correggio's pictures - she triumphs over all; I could almost believe that she is not mortal, that perhaps tomorrow she will no longer be what she was today, that neither with a brush, nor with chisel, in words, nor in tender tones can I hold fast her image, can I unite my feelings together with her in a work that would survive. (II, 29) The Romanticist Arnim is insisting here on the distinction between the mere "feelings" that echo a subjective inspiration and the more active and rare power of creative phantasy. When the German narrator attempts to excuse Aura's extravagant behavior to their Scottish host by asserting it to be the general fashion among German maidens, Aura significantly protests by claiming that "she is unique, wishes to remain so, and he who cares to understand her must raise himself up to her; she cannot lower herself without de- generating into dissonance" (II, 50). By emphasizing the universal but exclusive quality of the poetic imagination, Arnim reasserts the elemental conflict between the worlds of idea and matter. Accordingly, in the preface to his first volume of Novellen, the author observes that only those writers can be called true poets who give absolutely free rein to the Pegasus which deigns to carry them (I, xix). For' the unimaginative, unpoetical person who is unable to accept Aura's significance on her own ethereal level, she represents an insulting, superficial, and discordant force in human relations. The imaginative, non-possessive individual, however, gratefully enjoys Aura's presence whenever she sees fit to appear and participate. For example, Aura reveals herself to a group of people, who are not acquainted with each other, at the marriage mill in Gretna-Green. Only she [i. e. the mediating patron goddess of phan- tasy] could thus unite strangers on the bizarre level of a mass marriage, Arnim assures us. But gratitude is repugnant to her, Aura asserts, for after all - she is thoroughly accustomed to the contempt normal people show for the way in which she squanders her beauty and talents (II, 90). After arranging the wedding of all marriageable couples in the vicinity, she quietly slips out and away, whereupon the company prompt- ly lavishes that very unwanted gratitude upon her memory: "The girl from abroad . . . a good fairy . . . an angel! How could we have so misjudged this blessing from heaven to let her escape thus!" Pursuit is suggested, to which the answer comes: "Wait! . . . that is useless. Can you hold back lightning or a champagne cork as it flies forth? Pre- cisely this evanescence is what makes her so magnificent; if we held her fast, she would only sour us with her disastrous pranks." (II, 99)</page><page sequence="7">Amrnim 207 In this early phase, Arnim's own overabundance of imaginative zeal resulted not merely in a rather non-problematic, cavalier attitude to- ward the material dimension of reality but also in a general indifference to the problem of the artist's salvation through an act of mediatory sacrifice by Phantasy. The only sacrifice the latter makes at this point is the fact of her human individuation, which is otherwise unencum- bered by ethical or moral commitments; for nowhere does she encounter the ideating force of a worthy male counterpart, so that at the end she must return, somewhat sadly, whence she has come. In giving full rein to Aura's expression of self - which is reminiscent of the spritely man- ner of Bettina Brentano, the author's future wife - Arnim has circum- scribed through personification the broad mediatory character of Phan- tasy, whose rococo, Anacreontic coloration here still betrays its classical origns. Arnim's transition figure of Ariel reflects a continuing attempt to preserve such a unified and unproblematically rococo view of creative existence. In the story of Aura, the author was able to avoid the specific problem by not including the ideating figure of the poet. In the Ariel narratives, he seeks unsuccessfully to solve reality's split by including both halves of the creative polarity within the single androgynous figure of Ariel. Such a self-mediating being would unite an unlimited power of imaginative individuation with an absolute power of ideation - a phenomenon conceivable as enduring only in the being of God. Instead, the demigod Ariel alternately partakes of Phantasy's role and - partially through his poet's "revelations" in Ariels Offeenbarungen (1804) but almost exclusively in Der Wintergarten (18o9) - of the poet's mascu- linely intellectual role. WVhile no serious poet problem could arise on the jocosely social level of Aura's mediation, Arnim has at least paved the way through his monolithic portrayal of Ariel in the Ofenbarungen for a deepening and internalizing of the mediatory ethos, which culmi- nates still later in the ultimate conflict of the poet's soul. Hence, in the earlier work, the ambivalent and all-expansive image of Ariel - un- doubtedly modeled on Shakespeare's frothy air spirit - does not merely characterize the poet's phantasy but represents the total Romantic genus of phantastic poet. His forward-pointing shadow envelops like a fram- ing vision the actual narrative scene of a materially embattled present. Two years before the first appearance of the name in his poetry, Amim writes to Brentano that "Aridel is a completely wonderful fellow, not just a dancer or poet: he practices strange arts . . " (Steig I, 51). The transcendent dancing aspect in the Offenbarungen parallels Aura's alluring but elusive movements, while his demigod nature appears from an admirer's letter in the fragmentary frame of this verse novel, telling of Ariel's departure: "Do not think me out of my senses, but my senses are sick since I no longer hear his voice: my demonic genius is gone and my art has gone along with him" (198). Kryoline continues her description, which echoes the impact of Aura:</page><page sequence="8">208 Monatshefte He consorted with all sorts of weird characters, with whom he wandered about singing songs incognito. He came - no one knows whence, he has gone - no one knows whither, he has deceived everyone, given away much of his money and has left his bills unpaid. In the moonlight, Ariel appears like a sublime idea: with his dark hair falling in locks he hardly looks light of heart but rather like a light spirit brooding concernedly on the face of man. (199 f-) The materializing, feminine force in Ariel's dual nature and its source in the realm of idea is reflected here in Arnim's juxtaposing the hero's metaphysical appearance to the elements of Romantic moonlight and the wavy locks of dark hair. The dimension of phantasy is further empha- sized in references, by now familiar, to lamented, restless departure, to unknown origin, and to deceptive or changeable identity, whose total flux is further mirrored above in the musical element of minstrel song. The masculine poet's function of intellectual and ethical mediation ap- pears in Ariel's final brooding concern here for the destiny of his era. By beginning the descriptive sequence of this passage with material detail and concluding with a universal allusion to the human imagina- tion's far-reaching role as an ideating force, Arnim suggests the poet's fulfillment as the goal of the mediatory cycle. Later, the female admirer pays the back-rent for departed Ariel (as phantasy) in exchange for which the landlady offers her the manuscript of these revelations that Ariel (as poet) has left behind. On one of these mnanuscript sheets Ariel expresses a prophetic vision of the mythological springtime of Romantic poetry, where Ariel, the poet, and Ariel, the "sublime idea" of poetic phantasy, will have become one in the creative act of the poet's symbolizing perception and in the advent of symbolical or aesthetic reality: "And where art becomes one with nature, that is my realm, there I send forth my roots infinitely far, back into the past to all beginning, up into the future to the regeneration of the world: There is where my home is!" (2 15). Arnim very clearly identifies the Romantic dualism at this point in terms of art (masculine ideation) and nature (feminine embodiment). 7 Ariel, like Faust, is aware of the two souls in his breast that move past each other as opposed forces, each still yearning - in the best Romantic sense - for its fulfillment in the other. Finally, this visionary utterance reaffirms Arnim's conception of Ariel in the Offenbarungen as a poet-prophet figure on the scale of Saint John of Patmos. Although Ariel's demigod lustre never disappears completely, in Der Wintergarten Arnim visualizes Ariel's poet role in terms of his outer clash with an inhospitable, anti-poetic climate. Because the po- tential poet is surrounded here by a state of political oppression, only a weak formulation of inspiring phantasy is noticeable in this work, namely in the figure bearing the name "die Geniale." In effect, then, Arnim delineates Phantasy's impact on the poet figure by negation,</page><page sequence="9">Arnim 209 through her almost complete absence, and a rather disillusioned poet image results. Ariel is first discovered by members of the figurative winter-garden colony, perched high on a portal vantage where he is guarding the solitary villa of the handsome lady who personifies German art. In the darkness, the stranger's lantern is "mistakenly" identified as the colony's star of hope blazing against the wintry sky (XI, 190). Closer scrutiny of the light and its owner reveals Ariel in the role of night watchman - a far more important poet emblem than the star of hope, and peculiarly Romantic. Ariel says of his earlier enthusiasm for Romanticism's great program of a rebirth of imaginative art: "I become completely involved in whatever stirs me . . . We had hoped for a flourishing era in Germany and had worked hard. Like a won- drous, many-sided mirror, she was supposed to unite the world. To make a long story short, war came and smashed the mirror like a storm- lashed and homeless dove" (XII, i i). Thus this mirror image reflects the mediatory role which the Romanticists had envisioned for pre- Napoleonic Germany as a sanctuary for the imaginative spirit. Political and autobiographical implications make it increasingly clear as Der Wintergarten progresses that Ariel is also Arnim's own poet's mask, 8 and that creative inspiration has become a more problematic matter to him. A somberly demonic tone makes its first appearance when Ariel relates how only the intervention of a friend from out of the golden dawn-clouds of Ariel's youth has prevented the poet novice from destroying himself during winter's famine, that is, during the reign of Rationalism and Napoleonic violence (XII, 1 3). Ariel announces his intention of undertaking a voyage of exploration around the world until this European winter will have passed: "If I return, then I shall have used my time to best advantage and will enter without guilt into Europe's new era" (XII, 29). Thus the imaginative poet feels that the dominant spirit of materialism in the war-torn German provinces is too sterile a soil for the germination of poetic phantasy and for culti- vation by the artist. Instead, Ariel will leave Europe's hostile present and seek inspiration by exploring the world's literature of the past. And indeed, the main body of Wintergarten tales simply represents a retell- ing by Arnim of stories originating in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The narrative Ariel frame ends amidst the springtime thaw as the allegorical lady of German art adopts an orphaned child (symboliz- ing the paradisiacal era of the future) and bids a sorrowful farewell to Ariel, whereuponr the narrator significantly adds: "O, may the return of the world traveller really bring new joy to her!" (XII, 254). The concluding image of a ferryman's orphaned child reflects first that distant, spiritual homeland of absolute and unself-conscious harmony, then the artist's and Phantasy's creative act of aesthetic union, and finally it is Romanticism's climactic emblem for the ultimate mnysterium of human existence. As Arnim became more aware of the poet's problem of struggle for</page><page sequence="10">210 Monatshefte creative impetus, he also visualized more clearly the mediatory cycle of imaginative activation that proceeds from phantasy, through the poet and his work of art, and closes in that golden era of poetic culture, which is mediated by the new poetry and where Phantasy finds her home again. The author's awareness of this is mirrored first in his dis- sociating the portrayals of materializing Phantasy and the ideating poet in order to dramatize the poet's struggle and Phantasy's impact, and secondly, in an increasingly ethical formulation of the poet's own mediatory function. The result is increased narrative interest and an enrichment of meaning in Romanticism's aesthetic myth of the artist's salvation. The dissociated portrayals of the Tyrolienne and Juvenis mark the real starting point of this development in Arnim's formulation of the imaginative crisis. Here, for the first time, the roles of Phantasy and the poet are both present, completely distinct, and of equal im- portance. In the Juvenis tale (i818), the Tyrolienne - representing phantasy, as indicated earlier - is also said to come from a distant land and to be of uncertain parentage. Again, the absence of any proper name as well as her inability to describe her residence except in terms of "right" and "left" contribute the familiar, anonymous universality noted before in Arnim's characterization of Phantasy. She too is capriciously elusive and coquettish and yet possesses a modest candor that disarms. When Juvenis hears the tender singing of this child of nature, he feels himself "climbing, at times like a sleepwalker on mountain peaks, at other times like a dreaming miner down into the depths of glimmering, un- known, and abandoned passageways. Juvenis thought that such a spring- time, in which this kind of bird could be heard, is after all the brightest and most beautiful." (X, 226) In this context, the typically Romantic images of springtime, the mountain-climbing somnambulist, and of the dreaming miner moving through mysteriously flickering depths are es- pecially meaningful metaphors for the poet and for the domain of poetic phantasy. Juvenis first meets the Tyrolienne in his unknown mother's wintry greenhouse, a meeting which prefigures Juvenis' re- demption in the Tyrolienne's true springtime of poetic fulfillment that soon surrounds this tiller of the soil. In the greenhouse, Juvenis' emo- tional commitment to the Tyrolienne and his sacrifice for the sake of phantasy are demonstrated by his paying for the cherries she has stolen from the greenhouse's "artificial" tree of wisdom (X, 208). This bond motif was already noted in Kryoline's payment of Ariel-Phantasy's "stolen" rent, for which she receives the poet Ariel's manuscript. The image is used by Arnin~ to represent an implicit pact between Phantasy and the poet-to-be that will require sacrifice of their respective identities when a harmonious union replaces the polarity of their separate beings. By involving the poet-initiate in a decisive social test where he must unequivocally take sides by assuming her debt or "Schuld," Phantasy's unique existential challenge demands instantaneous recognition in the</page><page sequence="11">Arnim 211 sense of kairos, returning perhaps only in another, equally obscure in- dividuation. The nature of the dualistic struggle between his material and his ideological self becomes evident when Juvenis, in prefiguration of the porte mnaudit, exclaims: "The cherry thief is at once my sickness and my life!" (X, 217). The poet novice, painfully conscious here of the split in his own being between matter and idea, is in extreme need of externally mediated salvation, which can only come to him through the Tyrolienne's love. The latter, being an incarnation from the ideological realm, is of course self-mediating and hence does not require such sal- vation. 9 The approaching resolution of the conflict within Juvenis is foreshadowed in his thoughts, where the image of the Tyrolienne an- swers "every charming idea, every pleasant play of words with yet more tender and charming words, tones, and ideas" (X, 217). The Ty- rolienne then rewards his inner triumph by aiding Juvenis to escape both from the military prison, whither his devotion to her had brought him, and from his previous life as a soldier, i. e. from a materialistic vocation (X, 220). Finally, the Tyrolienne is able to repay her greenhouse debt to him in the form of "genuine" cherries of wisdom from her springtime garden, that is, from poetry's paradise (X, 222 f.). In this way, Arnim develops an ascending chain of redemptive imagery, beginning with the germinal motif of Phantasy's entrance into the pre-springtime greenhouse, where - significantly - the future artist is waiting for flowers. With his increasing awareness of the imaginative force in his life, he enters the phase of trial and inner conflict. The progression of motifs culminates in Juvenis' vindication of his creative power as an artist - which is reflected in the sudden arrival of spring- time beyond the prison walls. This explains Juvenis' initial impression of the Tyrolienne: "Her countenance, which appeared to him with a lovely paleness, had to wait until spring for its rosy rue and therefore yearned for springtime's coming" (X, 206). Arnim underscores the sacrifice inherent in accepting union with phantasy, first by blocking his characters' instinctive affection so that Juvenis wears feminine cloth- ing for his escape with the Tyrolienne, and then by revealing in the epilogue that the mediator of Juvenis' poetic rejuvenation is actually his sister. That is, the author stresses their close, organic relationship while also suggesting that the poet can never completely possess the inspirational force acting through him. But Phantasy here forms the necessary bridge of particularizing mediation also for her mother's (i. e. the intellect's) realm of pure - and hence sterile - idea or speculation, which Arnim renders with his image of the greenhouse. The creative tension within this Romantic "holy trinity" of Intellect, Phantasy, and the poet is reflected in a temporary rivalry between mother and daughter for Juvenis' affection that is then harmonized when the "unitarian" fig- ure of the father (i. e. religious belief) returns from the Orient. Juvenis, as well as the Faustian fragment of Die Pdpstin Johanna</page><page sequence="12">212 Monatshefte (posth. 1846), mark Arnim's closest approach to the allegorical bridging of split reality envisioned in Novalis' concept of universal redemption. Henceforth, in his ambitiously conceived Kronenwichter chronicle, the author strives toward a realistic yet visionary approach, in which a nar- rowing particularization of the poet concept results in the painter hero, Anton, and in a more limited, politically utopian age. Actually, in Part One of the epic, Arnim's innovative preoccupation with this detail technique of historical myth-making tends initially to quite smother the existential artist problem. The result is that the spirit of phantasy once again - as noted earlier for the roles of Aura and the Ariel of the Offenbarungen - has temporarily no active, ideating counterpart. In- stead, the composite materializing figure of Griinewald in Part One (18 17) acquires by assimilation certain features of the poet role. Sig- nificant in this connection are Griinewald's traits of the prophetic min- strel and of the impulsive, transvestite actor, "who, in one and the same breath, wanted to laugh and to cry, to be amusing and touching" (III, 365). Indeed, in the unfinished novel's first part, whose completion date approximates that of Juvenis, Griinewald appears in the familiar phantasy attire of the Tyrolean maiden from this latter work, with green felt hat and jacket, red bodice, and dark blue skirt (III, 39I f.). Like Aura and the Tyrolienne, Griinewald is also an early orphan and leads, like them, a Romantic "Wanderleben." As another combined embodiment of phantasy, who is originally one of the "Guardians" of the Hohen- staufen crown as well, Griinewald has the metamorphic capacity for transforming his personality according to the "mask" he adopts, whether it be that of a minstrel (III, 356), a Tyrolean maiden (III, 395 ff.), or that of an administrative official of Duke Ulrich's court (III, 423). His muta- bility reflects strikingly another of Arnim's paradoxical statements con- cerning the poetic imagination, which is found in letters of October and November, 18I2, to Jakob Grimm: "My theory of poetic invention: S. . that phantasy is only then true, when - deceiving - it deceives itself, just as human reason only then feels convinced when it is made true by the truth it is seeking . . . " (Steig, III, 224/242). Thus the illusion of any fanciful disguise he chooses to wear deceives Griinewald to the extent that he creates for himself a correspondingly new existen- tial role, through which the truth of a new world of human experience is open to him. In this Tyrolienne "mask," the mediating Griinewald is able to prophesy the birth and death of his former sweetheart's son, as well as the death of her husband, Berthold, the pseudo hero of the work (III, 483 f.). According to the notes for continuation of Part Two, Griinewald was to have supplied verses for Anton's paintings (IV, 398), just as in Juvenis the Tyrolienne furnishes the illustrations for the poet-plow- man's writings. Distinguished by his harp or zither, Griinewald first turns up in Arnim's dedication to Goethe of Des Knaben Wunderhorn as that work's guiding spirit, 10 and his final transformation occurs at</page><page sequence="13">Arnim 213 the outset of the Kronenwiichter's second part, where he appears and remains as an ordinary, immutable protagonist with the name "Giilden- kamm." Here, where the artist Anton's salvation is consummated, Griine- wald is replaced as mediator, first by Susanna, the gay, imaginative young daughter of Emperor Charles V and the Egyptian gypsy queen Isabella (IV, 381; cf. also Isabella v. Agypten). Later, Susanna's mediation is also obscured by the artist's decisive bond to the mysteriously visionary Voluptas. Anton's realization of his love for Voluptas furnishes the climax in the artist's odyssey of self-verification. As a hauntingly beau- tiful shade, Voluptas does not represent solely a mystical intensifying of Susanna's sisterly role as arbiter, for Voluptas is a composite image of all the women Anton has loved. The essence of everything beautiful in his life, her spectral form returns to taunt Anton at critical points in his artist's journey (IV, 233 ff.). In Arnim's sketches for the d6nouement, the artist-hero's winning of the imperial crown of the united German lands parallels the advent of a peaceful age of art as well as Anton's gaining of the imaginative perception of a unified reality. For, as the Parzival-like king of the Kronenburg, he is finally also able to symbolize directly his vision of creative phantasy in a perfect work of art, namely in his painting of the Voluptas spirit, whose features nlysteriously and significantly evolve into those of the Madonna (IV, 383). ~ Embracing creative imagination in this way as part of her domain, the Holy Mother's image of recon- ciling grace extends Phantasy's mediatory scope also into Christianity's sphere of the sacred. Anton's spiritual growth and the development of his symbolizing phantasy have now merged in the Romantic unio mystica of total religious experience. With the demonstration of self-unity as mirrored in Anton's con- summating his symbolic master painting, he and his art further project Phantasy's mediatory chain of redemption in a two-fold way. First, his painting mediates Romanticism's all-pervasive dualism by uniting pagan aesthetic sensuousness (Voluptas) with transcendental Christianity (Mary), a union epitomizing Romantic mysticism. Then, Anton as the reforming artist-king must mediate between the prosaic realm of his- torical reality and the domain of metaphysical ideals. In addition, Arnim himself, by having formulated these ideas in his historically visionary novel, embodies his own characterization of the poet, viz. as that pro- phetic reconciler who continually mythologizes the raw materials of historical chance by infusing them with the truth of aesthetic meaning (XIII, 460; Steig, I, 38). With this, the Romantic cycle of mediation closes on itself, for Anton's painting, like Arnim's aesthetic myth of the artist, actually mirrors its own creation by depicting here the sym- bolic figure of Mary-Voluptas and thereby representing the imaginative poet's vision of his own creative imagination. In so doing, the total Romantic symbol of salvation becomes self-mediating, from both the structural and existential viewpoints, and exists in this way for its own</page><page sequence="14">214 Monatshefte sake. The narcissistic, transvestite, and androgynous motifs evident in such monolithic figures as Aura, Ariel, Griinewald, Voluptas, and the Piipstin Johanna can also be related to the basic condition of self- mediating hybris. Moreover, the impressive focus as well as the limited content and static goal of Romanticism's aesthetic myth can likewise be attributed to this intriguing quality of the circulus vitiosus. Returning at this point to an earlier syllogistic comparison, the initial premise of the redemptive pattern asserted a split reality, which was qualified by the minor premise affirming phantasy's sym- bolizing mediation. However, this qualifying premise in Romantic aesthe- tics also appears as the new, imaginative reality and substance of the conclusion. Therefore, what remains as essentially "progressive" in the program initiated by Friedrich Schlegel is the stylistic innovation it accomplished, its new perception of the world - but not that new world itself, for which the search is still continuing. Schlegel had plotted the new existential center of Western art in a modern, Romantic my- thology; instead, the "new" center was found paradoxically in the soul of the Romantic artist himself. For the first time in the modern era, the poet figure was confronted with mediating, i. e. creating, his own salvation instead of relying on a conventional but no longer adequate theodicy. And this sovereignty of the creative ego in the Romantic artist's existential posture has its ultimate mandate in a kind of aesthetic unio mystica, in that absolute and irreducible identity of the creative act as proclaimed in "the beginmling word" of the Genesis according to Saint John. l Letter of Oct. 22, 1 812 to Jakob Grimm, in Reinhold Steig, Arnim und die ihm nahestanden (Stuttgart, 1894 ff.), III, 243. Cit. Steig. 2 Siimtliche Werke, ed. Wilhelm Grimm (Berlin, 1839 ff.), II, 247. This and all subsequent quotations in English are translations by the writer. Following is the original German text of this passage: "Und es erschien iiberall durch den Bau dieser Welt eine h6here, welche den Sinnen nur in der Phantasie erkenntlich wird: in der Phantasie, die zwischen beiden Welten als Vermittlerin steht und immer neu den toten Stoff der Umhiillung zu lebender Gestaltung vergeistigt, indem sie das H6here verk6rpert." Mere number citations within our text refer to the above edition. 3 Inherent in the symbolical style, this reciprocal process of ideating the material and materializing the idea has climactic expression in Stefan George's mythic principle of "Vergottung des Leibes" and "Verleibung des Gottes." Gesamtausgabe der Werke (Berlin, 1927 ff.), VI/VII, 52. 4 Cf. author's article "The Romantic Golden Age in Arnim's Writings," in Monats- hefte L (1958), pp. 24 ff. s This view is also supported by a possible interpretation of the key Majoratsherren passage (op. cit.) concerning the nature of phantasy. The subject pronoun in the final phrase, "indem sie das H6here verk6rpert," can be construed either actively with a transitive verbal aspect ("by her materializing these higher ideas"), as we have hereto- fore chosen to do, or passively with an intransitive verb coloration ("in that she per- sonifies these higher ideas"). 6Cf. Arnim's definition of the child symbol in Ariel's Offenbarungen, ed. Jacob Minor (Weimar, 2912), I42. Subsequent citations within the text refer to this edition of the work.</page><page sequence="15">Arnim 215 SCf. Arnim's statement during his debate with the brothers Grimm with regard to "Natur- &amp; Kunstpoesie": " . . . dennoch bleiben beide, was sie sind, die Kunst das Ordnende, die Natur das Schaffende" in letter of Oct. 2!, 1817 to Jakob Grimm (Steig, III, 401). 8 The fact that the child of Brentano and the poetess, Sophie Mereau, was christened "Achim Ariel" suggests that "Ariel" represented a private chiffre between the friends, perhaps transcending Achim Arnim's mere nom de plume and poet's mask. 9 Cf. the role of the "Kaiserin" in Hofmannsthal's Frau ohne Schatten, esp. her protean faculty of life-giving metamorphosis which corresponds to Phantasy's nature here. Both must appear in individuated form in order to mediate the material, mortal world but in so doing expose themselves to loss of spiritual identity through the sacrifice of loving. Johanna, the daughter of Melancholia in Arnim's Pdpstin Johanna, elects to make a comparable sacrifice when she renounces her immortal identity for the sake of her love to Ludwig. 10oThe dedication (XIII, I-8) consists of a modernized reprinting of Wickram's "Griinenwald" tale (No. 44) in the Rollwagenbiichlein ('555). Another reference to the minstrel appears in Arnim's appended essay, "Von Volksliedern" (XIII, 479). 11 In this painterly context, Arnim's acquaintance with Volupta, a traditionally Ro- man addition to the Charites, may stem from Botticelli's well-known "Primavera," where indeed not merely the Madonna-like features of Volupta but the festive representation of love, youth, and spring, as well, would have potent appeal for a Romantic symbolist.</page></plain_text>
