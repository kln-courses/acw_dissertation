<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FAILURE OF NATURALISM (A Reply to Eliseo Vivas) By PHILIP WHEELWRIGHT BRITISH writer once remarked that all good fallacies when A they die go to America, where they are reborn as some Amercian professor's latest discovery. So it is with the persistent fallacy that used to be called materialism and that now, with its language and presuppositions readapted to the latest tendencies in physical and biological theory, emerges under such names as naturalism, behaviorism, and scientific positivism. Notwithstand- ing incidental differences of idiom, the older materialism and the new naturalism are identical in this: that they accept the categories of science as potentially adequate blueprints of all reality, and the methods of science as the only ultimately valid approach to truth. Where neo-naturalism differs principally from its predecessor is in its shift of emphasis from the category of substance to the cate- gory of process - i.e., from static to dynamic points of reference - and in a greater refinement and economy of metaphysical pre- suppositions with which to work. By reason of these differences naturalism is better qualified to stand as the metascientific phil- osophy of our time - that is, the philosophy which best expresses an exclusively scientific outlook upon experience and an exclusive- ly scientific standard of truth. That the philosophy is sometimes espoused by thinkers of considerably more imagination and intel-</page><page sequence="2">CONTRA NATURALISM 461 lectual versatility than this definition suggests is one of the cor- rective ironies that attend all fallacies with a high survival quo- tient. Mr. Eliseo Vivas's foregoing essay is the latest attempt to justi- fy a neo-naturalistic philosophy. Because so practised and re- sourceful a thinker does not commit avoidable fallacies I am doubly convinced that the weakness of his argument proceeds from the essential untenability of the position he has chosen to maintain. It is that position, not its present sponsor, which it is my purpose in this essay to attack. First let us discover where we are agreed. I accept Mr. Vivas's assertion that a distinguishing characteristic of scientific method is "its public dimension": that science is operative "only when the procedures of investigation are fully open to criticism and improve- ment, which is to say, when the data can be publicly inspected and the hypotheses which account for them can be publicly veri- fied." I would add that since science requires that the data should be publicly inspectable and the hypotheses publicly verifiable with the greatest possible accuracy, the data and hypotheses which the scientist prefers and which more strictly deserve the appellation "scientific" are those which admit of measurement, i.e., which can be expressed in numerical rather than in verbally descriptive terms. When a set of data or the hypothesis constructed to ex- plain them is insusceptible to mathematical formulation, that is proof, from the scientific point of view, of its provisional char- acter: the scientist implicitly expects that vague descriptions will yield at some future stage of scientific evolution to descriptions that are mathematically exact. Therefore, since accurate measure- ment is possible only by spatial comparisons - a principle demon- strated by two such diverse thinkers as Kant and Bergson, and evident to anyone who stops to reflect on the nature of his ob- servations when he handles a ruler or reads a tube of mercury or the hands of a clock - it follows that the final reference of all scientific descriptions and theories is to relations calculable within</page><page sequence="3">462 KENYON REVIEW a space of three or more dimensions and assumed to be potentially the same for all observers. Not music but air waves, not feelings but blood pressure and adrenaline secretions, not secret thoughts but observable behavior are the terms with which the scientist, so far as conditions allow him, works. Publicly observable events in the physical world are the ultimate referents of every scientific proposition. I will not waste time professing my awareness that science can be very valuable, both in the inventions it gives to man and in the habits of exact thinking which it encourages. My chief concern in this essay is not with the procedures or results of science itself but with the philosophy of naturalism, which declares scientific procedures to be the only ultimately valid means by which truth may be sought. That philosophy is, in my opinion, the most dis- tinctive intellectual fallacy of our time - the highbrow parallel to the lowbrow irresponsibility and moral indifference which Ortega has so nicely described as "radical ingratitude," and which finds its proper linguistic correlative in the banal ejaculation, "So what?" Please note that I do not accuse science, in its strict signifi- cation, of irresponsibility. The charge is brought only against that promotional, high-pressure attitude toward science which goes by the name of naturalism. Science assumes full intellectual responsibility within its frame of reference, otherwise it is not science; the naturalist, however, is irresponsibly dogmatic - and therefore, incidentally, non-scentific - in his assertions about the external relations between that frame of reference and other areas of experience. An examination of Mr. Vivas's argument, I believe, will show this charge to be justified. Proceeding from the definition of science just quoted, Mr. Vivas draws the negative corollary that science "disqualifies all apriorism, all innate truths, all authority, revelation, and esoteric intuition." There is an inaccuracy in this claim of methodological purity, which it is necessary to clear up because of the partisan use which the naturalist habitually makes of it. The statement</page><page sequence="4">CONTRA NATURALISM 463 that science disqualifies (in its own procedures) all non-experi- mental avenues to truth holds good with respect to authority, revelation, and esoteric intuition; at least it disqualifies them as jurors, although frequently resorting to them as preliminary witnesses. Apriorism, on the other hand, is disqualified only in certain guises, while retained in others as vitally necessary to the scientific enterprise. Two types of a priori proposition in scien- tific thinking must be noted. There are the secondary propositions which distinguish the science of one school or period from the science of another. A familiar example is found in Euclid's as- sumptions (i) that between any two points there is one unique line called straight, and (ii) that about any point a circle may be drawn of any radius. These assumptions were and are one hun- dred per cent true so long as the geometer confines his operations to simple instruments that (i) slide or (ii) rotate, but the pos- sibility of such a construction as Minkowski's geometry of asymp- totic rotation shows their ultimately contingent characer. Other examples of secondary apriorism in science are Newton's implicit assumption that there is no limit to possible velocities, and the Law of Inertia that a hypothetical body unacted upon by any force must be either at rest or moving in a straight line - as against the equally plausible but less workable Greek notion that it would naturally move in a circle. Such propositions are a priori in the sense that they are not hypotheses susceptible of experimental verification but stipulations which furnish useful intellectual standpoints from which observations can be taken and hypotheses formed. The other and more basic type of a priori proposition em- ployed by science has already been indicated. Such propositions de- fine the framework of science and the canons of scientific method. Without implicit self-limitation to data of a potentially public, experimental, spatial, and metric character, science could not operate. A priori propositions of this second type have the char- acter of axioms to the scientist, as distinguished from the postu-</page><page sequence="5">464 KENYON REVIEW lational character of the first type. Science can and does exchange or modify its postulates from time to time, but it cannot substan- tially alter its axioms or it would no longer be science. So far there is nothing objectionable. Fallacy creeps in when the axiom that scientific data must be potentially public, experimental, spa- tial, and measurable, which to the practising scientist need have only an operational validity, becomes erected by the naturalist into the dogma that data having such characteristics (which may be summed up by the word "physical") are the only genuine data there are (the only ones not "disqualified") - that is to say, the only data ultimately admissible in the search for truth. Further light is thrown on the direction of the naturalist argu- ment by Mr. Vivas's curious statement, "Nor is exact knowledge the most important because the best." What this evidently means is that scientific knowledge is "the best" kind of knowledge by reason of its exactitude, although not necessarily "the most im- portant." To say that exact knowledge may be intrinsically "bet- ter" than important knowledge strikes me as either a very odd opinion or a very odd way of using words. Ignoring the seman- tic somersault of disjoining "good" and "important," my own code of values rejects so high an appraisal of exactitude for its own sake. Other things equal, exactitude is always preferable to confusion; but other things are by no means always equal, and exactitude can sometimes be bought only at the cost of ignoring one's most direct and fullest insights. I like to reason as exactly as possible - for sheer intellectual exhilaration and also for prac- tical benefits. But neither my intellectual pastimes nor the re- quirements of practical life are proof that exact knowledge is in- trinsically better than many an intuitive awareness that I could not possibly rescue from partial vagueness without destroying it. And it seems to me that such fleeting insights (what Mr. Vivas derides as "esoteric intuition") may sometimes, whatever their deficiencies in exactitude, reveal truths - a kind of truths - to which scientific experiments, confining themselves as I have shown</page><page sequence="6">CONTRA NATURALISM 465 to data of an altogether different type, are radically indifferent. Perhaps Mr. Vivas will retort that I am using the word "truth" too loosely; I would counter-retort that he is using it too narrowly, too technically. Of course it is permissible to speak of truth in a technical, scientific sense, but only on condition that the qualifi- cation "scientific" is clearly understood as limiting the species of truth under consideration. Naturalism ignores this all-important limitation. Supplementing his claim that naturalism is the way to truth stands Mr. Vivas's claim that naturalism meets and will increasing- ly meet the philosophic need of contemporary man. This is a proposition of a different type from the foregoing one. Its refer- ence, though partly philosophical, is partly also sociological, since it contains an implicit prediction about how men do and will re- spond to the philosophy of naturalism. The philosophical issue has been discussed. Let me devote a paragraph to the semantic and then a paragraph to the sociological aspect of this claim. The philosophic need of contemporary man, Mr. Vivas de- clares at the beginning of his essay, is "a dynamic integration of faith and fact, poetry and science, congruous with the orienta- tion of our culture." Now what is meant by the last part of this prescription.? What is this condition which the naturalist imposes upon the desired integration of faith and fact? The answer ap- pears to be given in the recommendation that we "make our peace with the irresistible tools of knowledge forged by Galileo and Newton." The confusion of metaphors in this statement is symptomatic of a confusion that permeates much of the naturalist argument. Tools, whether physical or intellectual, are not "ir- resistible": a tool, by definition, is something invented or appro- priated by man to be used for human ends. What is meant, then, by "making peace" with one's tools? I suspect it is an uncon- scious euphemism for letting the tools develop into a compli- cated machinery which ceases to be man's servant and becomes virtually his master. Modern man has been demoted from a</page><page sequence="7">466 KENYON REVIEW master of tools to a tender of machines; and this is almost as true in intellectual as in industrial enterprises. Thus while "making our peace with irresistible tools" is a semantic solecism with no intelligible meaning, "making our peace with the machinery of modern knowledge" does have a meaning - an inhuman and defeatist one. To "make peace" with machinery means, so far as I can see, that we yield up more and more of our humanity - i.e., our volitions and valuations - to the increasingly rigorous de- mands which a world of machinery imposes. Perhaps we can't help submitting to the appeasement process, but that is no reason for glorifying it. Particularly so in affairs of the mind. The "tools of knowledge forged by Galileo and Newton" were useful as tools; they become hideous when imposed as a set of categor- ies to which all "qualified" thinking must conform. The sociological nature of Mr. Vivas' claim is revealed in his concluding sentence. There is "every reason," he says, to expect that naturalism, enlarged and reconstructed, will be successful in the future where it has failed in the past - namely, in meeting men's need for a philosophy which, while recognizing science as the only method of obtaining knowledge, at the same time pro- motes and encourages "our sense for conduct and for beauty." Now this statement is different in type from a majority of Mr. Vivas' statements. While most of them are value-statements, pro- claiming the superiority, on one ground or another, of scientific to non-scientific types of inquiry and of naturalism to other philoso- phies, this present statement is an allegation of fact, a prediction about how man will respond at some time in the future. Surely predictions about matters of fact are the one type of proposition which we can all agree should be supported by scientific evidence before they are asserted. The evidence in the present case would be sociological: an authentic scientist would trace the social con- comitants of naturalism to date, and if he found the growth of naturalistic ways of thinking to be attended by the development and refinement of men's "sense for conduct and for beauty" he</page><page sequence="8">CONTRA NATURALISM 467 would then suggest - cautiously, for the evidence is complex and obscure - the hypothesis that the further growth of naturalism will be attended by a further such development and refinement. Has Mr. Vivas backed up his sweeping assertion with any such evidence? On the contrary he admits that until now naturalism has failed to provide men with the philosophical integration of fact, morals, and beauty which we all want and need. And yet in spite of its failure to date, he declares there is "every reason' that it will succeed in the future, on the extremely vague ground that "naturalism is in for enlargement and reconstruction." All right: granted that Mr. Vivas' prediction has not been proved and that his "every reason" is sales-talk rather than logic, let's examine this claim that naturalism can, without ceasing to be naturalism, undergo enlargement and reconstruction so as to meet men's spiritual needs. We are told what that naturalism of the future will, or should, do: it should retain "certain important areas of human experience, like the religious" and "certain values, like the heroic." I maintain that the first of these retentions is logically impossible, and the second possible but unlikely. Let us consider them separately. While religion in any legitimate sense and science in any le- gitimate sense are consistent, religion and naturalism are not. For as I have shown, science is simply a way of handling experience and of pursuing truth, but naturalism is the philosophy which declares that the scientific way of handling experience and of pur- suing truth is superior to any other way. Religion must stand in contradiction to the philosophy of naturalism, for it declares at the very least that there are avenues to truth other than the method of public experimentation, and that the truth so revealed includes (whatever else it may or may not) the shattering fact of transcendent mystery. Mr. Vivas dismisses mystery by remarking that there is a residue of mystery in all natural process, which re- cedes before the incursions of science but never vanishes. I agree: explain fire or gravitation as you will, there remains the unanswer-</page><page sequence="9">468 KENYON REVIEW able enigma of why nature is such that the luminous phenomenon called fire should burn instead of quench thirst, or why bodies should move toward rather than away from one another. But to place such mysteries on the same footing with the mysteries of life, of thought, and of conscience, to declare that the simple mystery of inorganic emergence is "no less a mystery" than the vast, dark, fathomless mysteries that trouble men's religious con- sciousness, seems to indicate a very limited degree of reflection upon the nature of mystery. This is not strange, for the naturalist is prevented by his logic from regarding mystery as worthy of serious contemplation. His only consistent attitude toward mys- tery is to regard it as the matrix of future scientific problems: not mysteries but problems command the scientist's attention. Now religion involves mystery as a way of knowing, and this gigantic paradox is utterly opaque to the naturalist. God - whatever his other attributes - must be intuited as luminous mystery: the al- ternatives are atheism or anthropomorphic superstition. Can naturalism recognize the existence and supreme importance of such a God? I say it cannot, and challenge Mr. Vivas to prove the contrary. Or if he agrees that naturalism excludes the possibility of a genuinely theistic God, then how can he say that naturalism retains the religious area of human experience? Can an area from which God has been banished be honestly called religious? "Certain values like the heroic" fare little better at the natural- ist's hands. Science can report the conditions under which hero- ism is observed to flourish or to decline - even as it can do for religion. But Nietzsche's exalted conception of the heroic as a mode of consciousness and as a pathway to wisdom is impenetra- ble to a purely scientific technique. By Mr. Vivas's own reason- ing, heroism - like all other phenomena of life, mind, and value - is explained and its problem is resolved "when we discover the conditions that determine the process" - i.e., the evolutionary conditions that originated it and the organic and environmental conditions that now sustain it. "When we have answers to these</page><page sequence="10">CONTRA NATURALISM 469 questions we know what mind is" - and presumably what hero- ism is also. The genetic fallacy, like the Devil, never admits de- feat! To be sure, there is no strict logical contradiction between naturalism and heroism, as there is between naturalism and re- ligion. For heroism does not - unless you are a Nietzschean - involve an affirmation about the nature of reality. The opposition between naturalism and heroism is rather a material one. Does the naturalistic reduction of all questions to "the conditions that determine the process" encourage the heroic temper or does it not? Does it build a race of heroes or not? My own experience as a college teacher has inclined me strongly, though at first un- willingly, to the negative. Analysis of all questions to their pure- ly factual conditions breeds, in a majority of college students, in- difference, easy-going cynicism, or in a few cases despair. The claim that a wider acceptance of naturalism will sustain and pro- mote the temper of heroism in men - if that is what Mr. Vivas means - seems to me, impugned as it is by available evidence, to be a piece of optimistic vapidity. In general, this whole business of setting up an ism to explain every aspect of everything everywhere to everyone strikes me as a useless and always self-defeating procedure. It encourages the vice of intellectual pride - the perverse delusion that there is a single key to fit all doors. The result, if one means what one says, is a growing blindness to perspectives other than those of which one's favorite ism can approve. Mr. Vivas starts off with a compliment to Plato and Thomas Aquinas, but read on and you'll see what he really thinks of their manner of philosophizing. Traditional phil- osophers, it appears, have made the mistake of trying to find out what things "are," but their efforts were doomed to failure be- cause there is really no such question. Any question of what a thing "is," he tells us, is only a confused way of asking how it be- haves - i.e., how it behaves to potentially public observation - and questions of whatness have therefore to be reformulated as questions of publicly observable behavior before a significant an-</page><page sequence="11">470 KENYON REVIEW swer is even theoretically possible. This seems to me a radical misunderstanding of the nature of philosophical questions and of philosophical truth. One would get from Mr. Vivas the idea that for twenty-five hundred years philosophers have been weaving the wind with disputes over unreal issues, and that intellectual culture has had to await the semantic disciplines of Messrs. Rus- sell, Carnap, Morris, and their associates and imitators in order to talk sense. And this is the position that he characterizes by the word "humility"! Let me close with a parable. On an island cut off from all intercourse with the outside world there lived a society of men who had once been devoted lovers of music but who in the course of generations - I don't know why - gradually lost their hear- ing. Those music-loving ancestors had built temples in which it had long been the custom for the populace to assemble once a week and listen reverently to the ceremonial plucking of native in- struments and the responsive singing of choir and congregation. They loved music to the point of worship and regarded it as a holy thing, the hearing and singing of which impressed itself as the most exalted form of human experience. Now when the population became gradually stricken with deafness there was no immediate change in their ceremonial habits. So solemn an in- stitution and practice could not readily be abandoned. Conserva- tives still attended the Sabbath musical services because their fathers and mothers had done so; they went on plucking their harps and zithers and exercising their vocal chords even though the sounds became gradually dimmer and by the fourth or fifth generation were heard scarcely at all. At length the more in- quisitive of these later descendants began to ask why the custom of plucking at strings while staring at hieroglyphic symbols and straining one's vocal chords to no purpose was ever originated, and why, having sprung from ancestral folly and superstition, it shouldn't be abandoned forthwith by men of a more enlightened age. Rebels began openly to denounce the hypocrisy of keeping</page><page sequence="12">CONTRA NATURALISM 471 up such a meaningless custom, and their arguments won many converts. Most men drifted into passive indifference. In time no one any longer attended the temple services except the priests and choirs who were paid in money or in lingering prestige for doing so, the intellectually feeble who had no prop but custom, and a small remnant of men who still retained enough of the faculty of hearing to feel something of the ancient reverence for music. These last were dubbed mystics, and when noticed at all were made the butt of ridicule. Psychologists built ingenious theories to explain the causes of their delusion, while semanticists started a campaign to have words like music, tone, and harmony elimin- ated from the dictionary, on the ground that they were semantic blanks, blah-blah words without any referent in actual experience. Since the society I am describing was a democratic one, the music lovers were not persecuted but came to be tolerated as harmless old fogies who might serve usefully to illustrate the bigotry from which most of the citizenry had happily escaped. The whole thing was accepted as a clear proof of social and intellectual progress. And of course no one heeded or understood when once in a while a music lover, goaded into argument, would reply- in sign-language, of course: "It is not we who are deluded, but you, you, my friends, who are deaf!" Is naturalism an escape from delusion or a cultivation of deafness? There lies the issue between Mr. Vivas and myself. We modern men of secular habits are prone to deafness, and naturalism offers to the ratiocinative among us a philosophical support and compensation. We are deaf to the three voices that constitute the testimony of religion: the voice of the soul's integral and secret intuitions, the voice of divinity incarnate, and the voice of living tradition. These three voices - the mystical, the pro- phetic, and the ecclesiastical - are dangerous guides: they speak ambiguously and their truth is hard to discover. But should we therefore reject them uncritically? There is no wisdom without risk. Nor do I see any a priori reason why reality should be</page><page sequence="13">472 KENYON REVIEW adapted to the peculiar conformations of human intelligence. The search for truth is the most formidable of adventures, in which the stakes are infinite and the outcome is never sure. Every pre- tended guarantee is counterfeit, and the object of my analysis has been to expose one such pretension, the most seductively plausible of our time. [Mr. Vivas will be given an opportunity in the next issue to reply to the objections of Mr. Wheelwright.]</page></plain_text>
