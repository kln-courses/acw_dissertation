<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERNST WIECHERT AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL EDSON M. CHICK Wesleyran University J.-J. Anstett's article "Ernst Wiechert Theologien" (Etudes Germani- ques, VII, 1952, 7-24) contains one of the rare unbiased discussions of Wiechert's religious views as they appear in his writings. Anstett con- cludes that Wiechert's entire work is a body of agnostic theology ex- pounded in an attempt to surmount his anguish at perceiving evil in the world. The conclusion is partially valid for the novels Wiechert wrote after 1938, and his attention is focused largely on these works. The article serves to clarify the confounding multitude of statements on religious subjects which fill these books. It also rightly specifies Wiechert's child- hood and youth as the source of conflict and dominant religious themes. Yet Anstett treats only cursorily the narratives written between 1913 and 1938. These are fully as worthy of inclusion as the novels of the following twelve years. Anstett's contention merits correction because Wiechert's novels may not be read and interpreted as a doctrine of nonbelief. Instead they con- tain a negative theodicy with persistent reference to circumstantial ev- idence in human experience that God's world is far from perfect. No considerable justification of the Judeo-Christian God is attempted. After 1938 and his imprisonment in Buchenwald Wiechert decides that God, as he has been pictured heretofore, cannot be adjudged benevolent and indicts Him like a prisoner in the dock. Passages from Das einfache Leben (written 1938-39), Der Totenwald (written 1939), and Die Jerominkinder I (written 1940-41) are expressions of an inverted mysticism, a search for knowledge of God in order to attack Him. They are the outbursts of a God-assailant who knows the nature of the object he hates and fears. The only piece of agnostic theology appears in Die Jerominkinder I where Jons Jeromin is educated to leave God out of the question. Yet at the same time he is fully aware of the nature of God and dedicates his life to defend mankind from His Schickungen. Far from declaring God to be beyond human ken, Jons seeks simply to equip himself better against Him. A vicious deity very much like Jons's enemy harasses Johannes Kar- sten in Die kleine Passion (1929), and the latter also makes plans to guard against God's blows. Actually the problem of the responsibility for suffering in the world and its solution form the key to all Wiechert's religious views in their development from 1922 to 1950 and therewith to the chief spiritual concern of all his writings which center on fundamental religious questions such as the existence and nature of God and the duality of faith and skepticism. Wiechert's autobiographical writings tend to gloss over the hostile sentiments apparent in his narrative work. He calls his writing a search for God and fails to consider the bitter battle which many of his heroes carry on against the divine. By saying that themes</page><page sequence="2">182 Monatshefte and ideas expressed in his own novels are not necessarily his own con- victions (Jabre und Zeiten, Erlenbach-Ziirich, n.d., 406) Wiechert then forces us to discount his analysis of his own books. Likewise, if he directs our attention to passages in his novels which seem to refute the pervading feeling of rebellion against God, it must be taken as the interpretation of a critic and apologist; it does not alter the content of the work itself. The justification of Wiechert's literary work as the expression of a Christian humanism, which has been tried many times, depends heavily on auto- biographical statements, minor episodes, and minor characters which go against the current of the whole. Wiechert is admittedly looking beyond traditional religions for his answers. His search for the divine leads first through the annihilation of accepted beliefs and later into a new realm of faith. The nihilistic approach characterizes his earlier novels. For example, the novel Der Wald (1922) deals with the despair of a fanatical religious reformer named Henner Wittich. Interest centers on the conflict between him and his green god of the forest. Two lesser characters in the novel, Lenze and Wera, seem to have found spiritual security in pantheism and naive pietism respectively, but these rank only as marginal possibilities. Henner is frustrated in his desperate attempts to contact his deity much as Wiechert's earlier heroes are condemned to search fruitlessly for meaning in their own lives. But where the question of transcendence had earlier been shrugged off as unanswerable, it now becomes a paramount issue for Henner. He is forever isolated from his green god; his conjurations and threats go unanswered. The deadly silence from beyond implies hostility. This situation is summed up in Der Wald (Berlin, 1935, I20): "Sein Gott aber verstiel ihn, er blickte iiber ihn hinweg. Und man konnte nicht leben ohne diesen Gott." Equally demonic is Wolf Wiedensahl's deity in Der Totenwolf (1924). This lord of war and hate turns on his prophet and drives him into insanity and destruction. In a Christmas brochure printed by his publishers 1 Wiechert apol- ogizes for pagan attacks on the Christian God in Der Totenwolf. He recants his blasphemy and speaks of a personal transformation from icono- clasm to piety. This metamorphosis is allegedly reflected in Der Knecht Gottes Andreas Nyland (1926), the novel advertised in the almanach. Yet when one consults the text, it appears that the previous anti-Christian tendency has given way to an open attack on the Almighty. The Christian God remains as distant and cold as Henner's green god had been. Andreas approaches Him with the ambivalent feelings of terror and defiance, love and hate. He does not question God's omnipotence but doubts His good- ness. The maintenance of any of these attitudes is futile, for questions, accusations, and entreaties receive no reply; and love leads to disaster. 1"Zum 'Knecht Gottes Andreas Nyland'," Grote'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung Almanach, XLVI (Weihnachten, 1926), 38-40.</page><page sequence="3">Ernst Wiechert and the Problem of Evil 183 God's silence appears as further confirmation of His guilt. Nyland addresses Him (Der Knecht Gottes Andreas Nyland, Berlin, 1926, 386) as follows: "Ist es dein Wille, daB das Blut aus jenen Jahren noch einmal rinnt? DaB3 sie schreien vor Qual, daB sie hassen und toten? Was ist das fiir ein Machwerk, das du laufen liel3est? ... Habt ihr Freude an unserm Scheiterhaufen? Weshalb sprichst du nicht, wenn ich dich anklage?" The answer is horrible, impenetrable silence. Despite the repetition of previous accusations one may note a trans- formation in Der Knecht Gottes, for there appears a second deity- likewise termed Gott - of a sort heretofore only touched on in Der Wald. Andreas' second god is nature. At one point it carries him in its womb like a mother (263). The nature deity is revealed in the forest and the fruitful field; it is protective and benevolent. But in Der Knecht Gottes it constitutes only a secondary possibility beside the silently hostile god- father who, like Wolf Wiedensahl's god image, stands so close to insanity (322). Der Wald, Der Totenwolf, and Der Knecht Gottes, the three novels from the period 1922-26, reveal a number of possible deities. Each work is an unsuccessful religious experiment. Each issues a complaint against the Christian God on the grounds that He is responsible for evil and a badly created world. Each introduces new gods and a new form of worship. And in each the hero succumbs to the demonic power he has tried to discover and worship. The inconclusiveness of these experiments is reflected in the protagonists' fates. The views are hastily formed and easily discarded in favor of new ones. Wolf Wiedensahl is as devoted to his war god as Nyland is to the womb of nature or Christ. This sort of experimentation and vacillation characterizes the pattern of Wiechert's whole work with the exception of the writings completed roughly be- tween 1932 and 1938. Whereas in Der Knecht Gottes and the earlier books there is but one type of god - the cruel, silent tyrant-occupying the minds of Wie- chert's heroes, there appear in the works of the next six years or so the images of three deities. Welarun (or Pan), Jehova, and the personal god of naive pietism designate the three possibilities. Welarun (the name be- longs to a forest spirit or god in Die kleine Passion) is pagan and pan- theistic, patron of beauty and sensuality. Jehova is the vengeful god of war and suffering who drives Wiechert's innocent heroes out of Welarun's Eden and is responsible for all evil in the world. The pietistic god, like Welarun, is an inheritance from Wiechert's childhood. This neighbor god leads an existence independent of the other two in Wiechert's panthe- on. Welarun and Jehova, on the other hand, conflict sharply. Johannes Karsten, prophet of the nature deity, is the chief character in the two novels Die kleine Passion (1929) and Jedermann (1931); he suffers under the prejudices of his environment and must in addition face the calculated blows of a vengeful god. Johannes adheres consistently</page><page sequence="4">184 Monatshefte to the emotional, pantheistic views Wiechert expressed in autobiographical essays at this time. His patron is Welarun, the supernatural lord of the pine forests, emblematic of the infallible, uniformly good voice of nature. His and Welarun's opponent is the despotic god who ordained the un- happy marriage of Johannes' mother and thereafter continued his per- secution unabated. "Und es schien nicht nur ein harter, eifriger Gott zu sein, sondern auch ein listiger Gott, der sein Opfer bis an das Tor der Schmerzen lockte, aber nun erst in Wahrheit mit ihm zu spielen begann, weil er erkannt hatte, daB er ohne Miihe mit ihm spielen kinne" (Die kleine Passion, Hamm, 1950, 28). The deity in question has his agents and counterparts on earth. Johannes' father is one; his favorite Biblical passage is: "Wen Gott liebt, den ziichtigt er" (i53). The tyrannical schoolteacher uses the same phrase (97) and is compared to the god of Abraham (98). Finally, Dr. Mohldenke drives Johannes and his paramour, Frau Mohldenke, from their Garden of Eden with a whip. Johannes inter- prets this episode in its Biblical and mythical connotations (3o2,317) and thinks of himself and others in the same situation as Christ-like martyrs (326), for in works of this period Christ is thought of as the innocent victim of Jehova, enduring needless torture on the cross. To combat this hostile, authoritarian deity becomes Johannes' life aim, quite like Jons Jeromin's. "Ich will etwas werden, wo ich darum kiimpfen kann, da8 niemals mehr zwei Menschen aus dem Paradiese gestoBen werden k6nnen. Denn aus dem AusgestoBenen [sic] gibt es keine Riickkehr, weil der SchweiB des Angesichts titet" (328). The way is open in Die kleine Passion for psychological analysis; the image of Jehova is clearly a father archetype. But the fact remains that here and elsewhere Wiechert attributes suffering and evil in the world to superhuman forces embodied in the Old Testament god. The mediation of Christ is not recognized. The forces of good are on the side of Welarun and are hard put to defend themselves before Jehova's on- slaughts. Public opinion on moral questions also serves Jehova's ends. Wolfram van den Berge, hero of "Der Mann von 40 Jahren" (written 1928-29), attempts a return to a childhood paradise and wants to escape from family responsibilities into a promiscuous love affair. He experiences a second birth and the ecstasies of Erloisung in Welarun's realm but is too weak to quell the voice of his conscience. Modern civilization and its moral pre- judices have spoiled him. Like the Medusa eyes of Nyland's brazen god, the accusing stares of his children bar him from full happiness. The plight of Johannes Karsten, Wolfram, and of several other ill-fated protagonists in Wiechert's tales from this period is a reflection of the author's own complaint against the world about him. 2 2 Cf.

Lilje Wiechert (Munich, n.d.), o107-1i2.</page><page sequence="5">Ernst Wiechert and the Problem of Evil 185 In the narratives dealing with World War I the prosecuting voice becomes louder. Here the responsibility for senseless bloodshed is laid unequivocally to a divine force hostile to the humans and animals. The front soldier is helplessly exposed to the authoritarian deity. In Jeder- mann (1931) Johannes Karsten thinks of him as a silent, omnipotent being who watches destruction by fire and steel unmoved and who plays with men as a cat does with a mouse. 3 Like the German Hiobssohn in Das Spiel vom deutschen Bettelmann (written 1932) who cries: "Nun bin ich ein zerschossen Wild, /mit dem der Jiger hat seinen Spott, /und dieser Jiiger heil3et Gott,"4 the wounded are impaled, as it were, on the cross of war. "La Ferme Morte" (written 1933), a short study of horror in the trenches, is constructed around the motif of crucifixion, and the picture of the cross appears persistently in dialog and description. The cross is like a man-eating Moloch.6 A beam with a slanting crosspiece protrudes from a heap of rubble next to the trench and resembles a fallen cross. Its shadow at sunset looks like a bridge of death (i2-I3). It is suggested that three additional crosses should stand next to it (20zo), the extra one for the soldier-martyr. A passage in Jedermann speaks of the wounded as the crucified (167), and in "Die Flucht ins Ewige" (written 1927) the cross is described as a "Gebiirde des Fluchs."6 The god who carries the responsibility for war is then an un- interested observer and a sadistic tyrant. Both his silence and activity are dreadful. Elsewhere, he can be made to appear a jealous, aging monarch who blinds a soldier, "wie alternde Konige ihre jungen Sdhne blenden lassen, weil sie ein Vorwurf ihres Irrtums sind."7 This god is resentful of reminders that he has created the world wrong. Unable to justify himself to mankind, he wreaks revenge. The other side of Wiechert's reference to transcendence stands out in contrast to his indictment of Jehova. In the Novellen collected under the title Das heilige Jahr and in others from the period around i930 he glorifies the naive religious faith of simple souls. The typical hero of these tales is a slow-witted peasant who is finally rewarded for his steadfast belief in a benevolent deity. This is a possibility to which Wiechert gives little convincing support. Its adherents are in general intellectually weak and therefore incapable of seeing that their creed is proven untenable by the state of the world about them. It is a possibility from which Wiechert is separated by an abyss of knowledge. Jons Jeromin speaks of this situation (Die Jerominkinder II, Munich, n.d., 876) which is characteristic for Wiechert throughout his career: "Welch ein Abgrund lag zwischen SJedermann (Munich, 1951), 390, 231. SDas Spiel vom deutschen Bettelmann (Munich, 1951), 20. 6 "La Ferme Morte," Der Todeskandidat/La Ferme Morte/Der Vater (Zurich: I948), I8. 6"Die Flucht ins Ewige," Der silberne Wagen (Hamm, 3950), 250. 7 "Die Hii31iche," Die Flote des Pan (Zurich, 1944), 191.</page><page sequence="6">186 Monatshefte ihm und dem Vater, der den Meiler bewacht und an seinem Tisch den Propheten Jesaias empfangen hatte. Ein Abgrund mit Formeln und Zeichen, mit Lehren und Ideen, mit Bildern und Erkenntnissen." Knowl- edge forms the biggest obstacle to the attainment of peace and spiritual security enjoyed by the simple people whom Wiechert depicts in af- fectionate terms. The minions of Jehova, however, have driven the think- ing man from the paradise of nature and naive faith. The magic power of that faith can, in the narrative "Veronika" (written 1931), extend over the intervening years to inspire a soldier at the front. The mere recollection suffices to calm his growing anger at a god who rains down blood from heaven. Yet "Veronika" contains an isolated religious possibility in answer to the problem of evil. Few of Wiechert's other works present such a victory over doubt within the bounds of belief in the Christian God. The one answer which does stand the test over a long period appears in Die Magd des Jirgen Doskocil (1932). Jiirgen poses a theory (Die Magd des Jiirgen Doskocil, Munich, 1935, 134) in answer to the question whether God destroys evil in the world: "Aber wenn der Weizen Kraft hat in seiner Wurzel, dann wiichst er so dicht, daB das B6se erstickt." His wife Marte interprets the agra- rian analogy to mean that if we grow better every day, then evil will die off of its own accord. Doskocil is the summation and apparent reconciliation of religious themes Wiechert employed in the period 1926-32. In the figure of Jiirgen are embodied at once the pagan pantheism and the primitive Christianity which were observed heretofore as disparate elements of Wiechert's re- ligious thinking. The combination of the two spiritual possibilities, work- ing in concert for the first time, has sufficient strength to beat back Jehova. The latter is represented in the novel by Mac Lean, the Mormon preacher. The worst religious abuses and the principle of evil are incorporated in him. He is the criminal intercessor between man and the truly divine and is like the angel with the fiery sword (74). The good side wins; yet the full meaning of the novel includes more than the victory of simple faith and pantheism. Wiechert has, at least for a time, solved the vexing problem of evil by a worldly answer expressed in Jiirgen's vegetal analogy. On the other hand Jehova's power does not die with Mac Lean. In Jiirgen's wife Marte, the one truly human character, he lives on as a spiritual force. She murders Mac Lean in the honest conviction that she is eradicating the threat of evil, but her conscience compels her to satisfy the demands of justice. She goes willingly to jail because the stern commandments of Jehova are still in effect and deserve human respect. The dictatorial deity Wiechert once indicted as the originator of evil is now viewed as the author of eternal laws and eternal order. The burden of guilt has been removed, and he, in turn, has been removed beyond the universe. He is revealed only through his Ordnungen. Wiechert has then turned to yet</page><page sequence="7">Ernst Wiechert and the Problem of Evil 187 another religious possibility: deism. His best works from the middle 1930's (Die Majorin, "Tobias," Hirtennovelle) were composed in the atmos- phere of this religious conviction which implies an end to concern with supernatural responsibility for evil. In works written between 1932 and 1936 Wiechert stresses a virile, forward-looking ethic quite different from the futile escapism of "Der Mann von 40 Jahren," for instance. There is now but a single religious possibility. Brooding over the nature of God and the origin of evil ceases in favor of vigorous concern with this world. This may be illustrated by the lines from "Die goldene Stadt": "Traut nicht auf Baronen und Pfaffen /traut nicht auf Kaiser und Gott! /Nur die eigene Faust kann euch schaf- fen /den Weg zum Morgenrot."8 In Die Majorin (i934) there is only one mention of the problem of evil in the form of an outburst against God; and that is an indication of how sick the hero's soul is. The central theme of the tale is the healing of an embittered man and his return to a useful life. The majority of Wiechert's works between the years 1932 and 1936 are marked by a considered, calm style in sharp contrast to that of his earlier publications. He depicts personal experiences, par- ticularly his childhood, with little of the earlier pathos of despair. Wilder und Menschen (1936) has been placed among the best books of Jugend- erinnerungen to be published at a time when the genre was widely cultivated. Hirtennovelle (1935) stands as Wiechert's finest piece of narrative craftsmanship and as his secular, deistic gospel. After 1936 Wiechert's confidence in an orderly universe and in the just power of divine law again wavers. Even before his imprisonment in Buchenwald in 1938 complaints arise over the uncertainty of human existence in a chaotic universe where the individual is "ein Spielball der Elemente." 'o The world is cold and hostile (Eine Mauer um uns baue, i937), and Wiechert can discern no security beyond his own powers. Two months in a concentration camp aggravate this vague uneasiness so strongly that an accusation of God bursts forth stronger even than those in Die kleine Passion and Jedermann. For Johannes, the only faintly fictitious narrator of Der Totenwald (written I939), the sympathetic neighbor god of Das heilige Jahr is forever dead, and Jehova has ascended the throne again. The experience of radical evil accentuates Wiechert's feeling of despair and leads him to total religious disillusionment. That such horrors as he sees can be perpetrated is also sufficient evidence that the beneficent God-father of popular belief is a hoax. Yet Der Totenwald does not deny or ignore transcendence. Wiechert still recognizes a deity but is at a loss for definitions. The change in conditions of existence requires new religious views to conform with them and to explain evil. Such is the spiritual conclusion arrived at in this Bericht which reports VoTlkische Kultur (May, '935), 198. Die Majorin (Munich, 1935), 50-51. "Vom Trost der Weklt," Goethe-Kalender (1938), 34.</page><page sequence="8">188 Monatshefte the need for a new god image in accord with reality. It will necessarily be a pernicious or indifferent power; for, as in most of Wiechert's the- ological speculation, God must bear the responsibility when things go wrong. For the author of Der Totenwald He is either dead, or He must be different from our conception of Him. WViechert's rebellious questioning reopens the trial which was tem- porarily concluded by deistic compromise in Doskocil. In 1938 it assumes a new guise. Although more religious possibilities appear than the three discernible around 1930, all except Jehova are quickly discarded. They are rationally unacceptable in the face of visual evidence that their objects of worship cannot exist. Rather than assume the existence of a cold, hostile god with traditional anthropomorphic traits, Wiechert sets about in Das einfache Leben (1939) to strip him of his godly characteristics and to equate him with the principle of blind, natural necessity. This concept alone can be harmonized with the state of the world and with the presence of moral evil. In working out the redefinition, Wiechert's hero, Kor- vettenkapitan von Orla, adheres to the scientific method; for the heartless laws which govern the universe and life can only thus be perceived. As a good scientist he ignores considerations of moral goodness and evil and scorns teleological theories. "Zwecke triibten das Licht und verwirrten die Linien. Auch so stand hinter allem noch immer das letzte Gesicht, aber es trug weder menschliche noch gottliche Ziuge. Es besal3 weder Raum noch Zeit noch gar eine sittliche Verklirung."11 The religious content and tone of Das einfache Leben may not be termed agnostic; for even though the outlines are blurred, Wiechert does not doubt the presence or knowability of the divine. On the contrary, his hero aims to uncover its true nature. The change in spiritual conviction, however, is difficult for Orla and Wiechert. The old, emotional faith in "der liebe Gott" still holds strong attractions, and Orla is allowed to think at the end of the book: "Lieber Gott, . . . manchmal wiire es doch sch6n, an dich zu glauben und an deine allmiichtige, schiitzende Hand" (383). Orla does not thereby admit defeat, but his confession that it would be nice to believe in the old way suggests that it is hard to deny tradition and rob the divine of its humane traits. Wiechert's negative theodicy culminates in Der Totenwald and Das einfache Leben with the statement that the old pietistic and nature gods are gone because they could not logically coexist with the apparent condition of the world. Yet the pronouncement of death cannot be taken as a denial of tran- scendence, for there and in Die Jerominkinder I (written 1940-41) Jehova is a force to be reckoned with. He reappears in the terrible form he assumed in Die kleine Passion ( 1929). Die Jerominkinder I is the one work where agnosticism plays an important role. In despair of harmonizing traditional faith and reality, Das einfache Leben (Munich, n.d.), 330.</page><page sequence="9">Ernst Wiechert and the Problem of Evil 189 Wiechert wrote an Erziehungsroman in which the hero, Jons Jeromin, is educated to nonbelief. Jons makes his decision in response to the warn- ing example of Pastor Agricola, who battles to exhaustion in vain with Jehova, the unresponsive Kindermlirder. Under the tutelage of two skeptical advisers Jons outgrows the simple religious sentiments of his family and homeland and hardens himself against God. "Wir kdnnen uns niimlich so wappnen, daB auch ein feuriges Schwert uns nichts ausmacht. ... Der richtige Mensch ist unanfechtbar . . . Wer seine Seele hiirtet, kann ruhig jeden Speer erwarten," says one (290). The words Kinder- mdrder and feuriges Schwert point to the authoritarian god of Johannes Karsten. He has now risen to unopposed prominence. Jons never denies his existence, nor does he indicate that he is unknowable. The nature of Jehova is only too clear. To justify his regiment would be to evade the issue. For Jons and Agricola all theodicies and religions consist in a tissue of words designed to disguise the bare facts of evil and suffering. The word, whether it be a pronouncement of faith or an attempt at rational explanation of in- consistencies, is as worthless as Agricola's suicidal struggle. The best defense against God's apparent malevolence is indifference. In making this choice Jons Jeromin is, in effect, accusing God with the same vir- ulence as Johannes Karsten and the Johannes of Der Totenwald. His apparent agnosticism is a negative theodicy. Shortly after World War II, Wiechert made a programmatic state- ment in the essay "Abschied von der Zeit," 12 asserting that he had long ceased to brood over how the contradiction between faith in "der liebe Gott" and the brutal facts of experience might be explained away. The gaping abyss between can only be bridged by deeds of love or art. Yet in Die Jerominkinder II (1947) Jons' spiritual predicament shows familiar features. Nazi brutality strikes him as "eine Entartung der Ewigkeit. Ein tddlicher Stol3 mitten in das Herz der Macht, die ihn von der Meilerhiitte an geleitet hatte" (838), and Jons broods over the question of God's re- sponsibility for evil when a friend is driven to suicide (874). But unlike other Wiechert heroes Jons is led to a happy end in that he finds release from the spiritual tension that plagued his forerunners. In a mystical, irrational experience of union with nature he overcomes, or eliminates, the intellectual considerations which have heretofore blocked acceptance of any explanation for evil. The disturbing factor of rational thought is removed and with it the prime cause of brooding over inconsistencies. In Die Jerominkinder II the question of evil loses its urgency and is over- shadowed by the renascence of an old religious possibility: nature worship. Wiechert's last two novels, Die Jerominkinder II and Missa sine Nomine, witness the revival of biocentric religious views much like those expressed in Die kleine Passion and other works of earlier years. The 12 Es geht ein Pfliiger iibers Land, i62-i68.</page><page sequence="10">190 Monatshefte cult uses Albert Schweitzer's phrase "Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben" (Die Jerominkinder, 664) but in a context far removed from Schweitzer's Christian mysticism and suprarational optimism. Jons finds redemption in the surrender and dissolution of his thinking self in union with nature and the universe. "Er war aus dem Reich des Geistes herausgetreten und wieder in den Ursprung zuriickgekehrt. Er wuchs and bliihte wie eine Pflanze. ... Die schreckliche Einsamkeit war fort, das Losgeldstsein von der lebendigen Erde" (846-847). Bound to the divine magischer Urgrund of the soil, the foundation of Wiechert's new religious possibility, Jons is able to recognize a weise Fikhrung (836) behind the events of his life. Consolation and reconciliation are the watchwords of Wiechert's later years. Missa sine Nomine (Munich, 1950) signifies the culmination of the tendency and offers a truce in the battle with God. It also clearly refutes Anstett's assertion that Wiechert is an agnostic; for Missa contains what amounts to a theosophical explanation of the origin and nature of evil. Wiechert seeks to justify the existence of evil in nature and human life and therewith to comprehend a world where the bad permanently opposes the good. The terminology of Missa is reminiscent of Jakob B6hme's theosophical speculations. The idea that good and evil spring from the same magischer Urgrund (Bdhme says Ungrund) is the common basis. Wiechert describes this groBes Geheimnis: "DaB ihnen gezeigt worden war, wie wenig Feindschaft zwischen dem Guten und dem B6sen zu sein brauchte. DaB die Guten so wenig Recht hatten, sich tiber die Bdsen zu erheben, weil tief, ganz tief unten derselbe Urgrund fiir beide bereitet war. DaB die groBe, weise Ordnung sie beide umschloB" (418- 419). B6hme says of his gropes Geheimnis: "Dieser Grund wird darum Mysterium Magnum genannt, oder ein Chaos, daB daraus B&amp;ses und Gutes urstiindet, als Licht und FinsterniB, Leben und Tod,... denn es ist der Grund... der bdsen und guten." '3 Like B6hme, Wiechert considers evil the necessary complement of the good, "die Potenz der Nacht gleich- sam, ohne die der Tag nicht da sein wiirde."14 As striking as these similarities may be, there are also considerable differences. Bdhme's Ungrund is an eternal chaos which existed before God. Wiechert, however, believes evil to have been woven into creation by God's will as part of a great, unalterable design (Missa, 2 i7). Like the Stoics he justifies physical evil by making it part of a perfect whole, the shadow in the picture, or the villain in the play. Even bullet wounds inflicted on the hero Amadeus from the guns of die-hard Nazi youths are viewed as natural compensation for the execution of one of their number (275). The process of equalization supposedly reflects the laws 1s "Schliissel," Jakob Bdbme's simtliche Werke, ed. K. W. Schiebler (Leipzig, 1922), VI, 666. Cf. Anstett's article, 20; he is led to think that Wiechert was ac- quainted with B6hme's works. The resemblance between the great mysteries may, of course, be accidental but does underline Wiechert's theosophical trend. Missa, 2i8; cf. "Theoscopia," Bdblme, VI, 455.</page><page sequence="11">Ernst Wiechert and the Problem of Evil 191 of nature, which must be accepted as inevitable. Amadeus has come to the realization that both wolves and lambs belong in the circle of creation. The soil is the emblem Wiechert uses to describe the natural balance in his tellurian mythology. It is the governing factor in the reciprocal relation between good and evil (268-269, 275, 353, 408, 417). In a bright and beautiful child of corrupt parents or in the ear of grain risen from dark roots is revealed "der ganze Sinn der Erde" (42i). The vegetal analogy is reminiscent of the solution to the problem of evil found in Die Magd des Jiirgen Doskocil (1932) where mankind alone was granted the responsibility and power to eradicate malignity with its own hands. This optimistic humanism is lacking in Missa despite talk of purification and transformation. Radical evil is always there and threatens to return. In effect, Missa represents a forced reconciliation with the divine whereby hostility between good and evil is de-emphasized to a point of insignificance. This is accomplished by a fatalistic acceptance of things as they are. In his last novel Wiechert calls a halt to his ac- cusation of God and ceases to indict Him on rational grounds. God is no less to blame for suffering, but is justified by an irrational, magical, the- osophical theory in which the term "God" assumes a figurative meaning tantamount to the ordering forces in nature. Tiredness and surrender moti- vate the conciliation. Wiechert's picture of nature is essentially static. It admits of no progress beyond the limited circle of creation within which the balance between good and evil is continually disturbed and restored. Here lies the chief distinction between his theosophical speculation and Bihme's or Hauptmann's. The latter envision a dynamic, dialectical pro- cess wherein the bad serves to goad the good into positive action. Except for one notable interruption which includes Doskocil and Hirtennovelle Wiechert has conducted a campaign against God and Church without finding religious views to which he can consistently sub- scribe in his writings. Persistent experiment and radical changes of opin- ion make the concluding armistice in Missa seem suspect. Like the major part of Wiechert's work it is another attempt, in muted tones, to know God and to link Him with the experience of good and evil. The goal of spiritual harmony is reached in the end by the arbitrary silencing of dis- sonances which hitherto have defied removal. Wiechert has fled this field of battle just as he has taken flight from the intellect and Western civilization.</page></plain_text>
