<plain_text><page sequence="1">Maize Beer and Andean Social Transformations: Drunken Indians, Bread Babies, and Chosen Women M. J. Weismantel Introduction Ethnographers who study the Andes of South America have re- cently begun questioning some of the underlying assumptions of our profession. The hallmark of much traditional Andeanist eth- nography has been an emphasis on discovering in the lives of con- temporary people those cultural practices that are of Native Amer- ican origins. This approach is now decried as yet another example of cultural imperialism, the Western impulse to search for exotic "Others." Our fascination with Indians, we fear, has led us to a distorted portrayal of the complex lives of contemporary people, for many of whom indigenous culture is only a single aspect of a multifaceted identity (Weismantel 1991). In our desire to defend Andean cultural values, we have perhaps overlooked the realities of Andean societies, and so reduced their histories to a static and timeless "culture" that has little to do with the lived experience of those we study. The entire notion of cultural continuities between the preCo- lumbian past and the present is under attack. A consensus seems to have been reached that the earlier paradigm of lo andino, the idea of a shared Andean culture still existing in remote peasant villages and within rural households, having outlasted the demise of its fullblown manifestations in great civilizations such as that of the Inca, must be abandoned as an essentialist fiction. MLN, 106, (1991): 861-879 ? 1991 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">862 M. J. WEISMANTEL Our romantic involvement with lo andino seems especially diffi- cult to defend since, in the last decade, the Andes have been the site of tumultuous and conflict-ridden processes of rapid change. The city of Cuzco and its surrounding area was the heartland of the Inca empire, and it retains something of the same status as a cul- tural center today. Ethnographers working in this part of southern Peru have written lyrical descriptions of rituals, textile patterns, and the names given to the stars; maps have been made of the sacred shrines of the area, and the songs, folktales, and riddles of its people compiled. But the recent history of the region stands in stark contrast to these cherished images of cultural wealth. During what has come to be known as the "lost decade" of the eighties, the local economy has been shattered, and fighting between guerillas and the army has taken hundreds of lives, sending thousands flee- ing to Lima and beyond. Other conflicts have transformed the social landscape we thought we knew. Catherine Allen's lovely writings about the reli- gious significance of the coca leaf have finally been published (Allen 1988) at the same time that the North American appetite for its derivative, crack cocaine, has made militarized zones out of large areas of Colombia and Bolivia. And after all our decades of careful work on religious syncretism, detailing how apparently Catholic rituals were used by indigenous communities to keep alive preCo- lumbian religious beliefs and practices, Quechua and Aymara- speakers by the thousands are converting to Protestant sects that condemn these very rituals as idolatrous. This was the situation as the 1980s drew to a close; but even as we have been struggling to comprehend these changes, and to evalu- ate the capacity of our political stances as well as our conceptual categories to respond, the Andes have entered the nineties. While academics have been questioning the idea of cultural continuities from the Inca Empire to contemporary rural life, new writings and actions by the Andean peoples themselves suddenly remind us that this issue is not only of scholarly interest, but enlivens political debates within the Andes as well. Throughout the Andes, indigenous political movements are in- creasing in strength. Even in Ecuador, which in recent times has been known for quiet and apolitical masses in comparison to the more vocal peasants and workers of the other Andean nations, indigenous communities all over the country united and rose up last year in a national protest movement so large as to attract the</page><page sequence="3">M L N 863 interest of the international press. For thousands of people, Indian nationalism, based on the image of themselves as inheritors of a pre-Columbian culture defined as "Inca," is a tremendously pow- erful and popular ideology. The existence of lo andino as the cul- tural root of contemporary societies may be a romantic myth about the relationship between the present and the past, but it is never- theless part of the fabric of modern Andean society. Foods and drinks associated with indigenous life-crops such as quinoa and potatoes, and native fauna such as the llama and the cuy-have become favorite symbols to convey this nationalist mes- sage. Even more celebrated are the typical dishes prepared from the foods; and among them all, the most famous is the thick, yeasty beer brewed out of maize, known as chicha in Andean Spanish.1 Chicha itself has been disappearing in many parts of the Andes throughout the twentieth century, but at the same time, among the intelligentsia sympathetic to indigenous movements it has enjoyed a renaissance. To those who are unsympathetic with indigenista politics, nothing could be more ludicrous than the championing of this peasant drink. The brewing and serving of this fermented beverage can more easily be seen as epitomizing the unsanitary and unwhole- some aspects of rural culture rather than its nobility. More impor- tantly, it is widely believed that the besetting sin of the Indian lies precisely in his addiction to alcoholic overindulgence. The fundamental political issue in these two interpretations of chicha, and by extension of contemporary indigenous culture as a whole, is a debate over the validity of cultural pluralism. For those who extol the honorable history of chicha, the Andean nations will triumph only when they begin to value the entire cultural heritage of their people, not merely the European, and abandon the policies of relentless cultural extirpation that have been among their de- fining characteristics. To those on the other side, the only route out of the economic and social debacle of the 1980s lies in a total embrace of a Western identity; those who would cling to defeated and disreputable ethnicities have no place in the modern state. These two positions depend upon conflicting interpretations of the present and the past, and of the relationship between the two. Thanks are due to Benjamin Orlove for our intermittent conversations and correspondence about chicha and politics, and to Kay Candler, who bought me my first glass of chicha.</page><page sequence="4">864 M. J. WEISMANTEL Indigenista ideology finds in present practices much of dignity and value, and in pre-Columbian history a glorious heritage never to be forgotten. Present and living past are linked by the symbol of chicha. To those who reject the notion of cultural heterogeneity, the Native American past is dead and buried and the present offers only two choices: the white, Western model of success or the Indian road to failure. The latter is epitomized in the image of the drunken Indian, the last pathetic reminder of an exhausted heri- tage and a dying race. As an anthropologist, I am uncompromisingly committed to the politics of cultural heterogeneity. By the same token, however, my sense of Andean history does not permit me to see living Incas in the Quechua-speakers of the late twentieth century; but it does, I think, enable me to see more than a poverty of culture in the image of the drunken Indian. While in academic circles it is politically fashionable to find the romantic essentialism of lo andino distaste- ful, the actual politics of the moment in the Andes seem to demand that we look once again for continuities with the past; in this paper, I offer some thoughts on hidden similarities between three images of Indian food and drink: the drunken Indians of Zumbagua, the parish of highland Ecuador where I did my fieldwork; the "bread babies" of the Andean feast with the dead, using the example of the most famous Ecuadorian Indians, the Otavalefios of Imbabura; and the chicha and sancu made by the acllacuna, holy women of the Incas, as described by one of the greatest Inca writers, the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. Drunken Indians Zumbagua, the area in which I did my fieldwork, is typical of the rural Andes in that chicha has almost disappeared, having been replaced by a much stronger alcoholic drink, a very high-proof liquor made from sugar cane and known as trago. Thus, I had almost no experience of drinking chicha while in the field. How- ever, drinking itself is an important and very ritualized part of social life in indigenous communities, and my research provided me with ample opportunity both to analyze and experience this aspect of Andean culture. Drunkenness has a very special relationship to race and class in the Andes. In little out-of-the-way towns like this, where physical</page><page sequence="5">M L N 865 comforts are few and day-to-day living is often quite dull, heavy drinking is common among all social classes. I went to visit one of the few remaining haciendas in the area, where the owner, a young man with an M.A. in agronomy from an American university, in- vited me to sit with him in chilly and baronial splendor in his vast dining room, where we ate potato soup that was cold by the time it had travelled from kitchen to table, and drank American whiskey. It was nine o'clock in the morning. Poor whites drink, too, especially the men; they sit in local bar- rooms and down bottles of beer, then roar out into the countryside to show up uninvited at Indian weddings, where they get into fights and annoy the women. But despite the ubiquity of drinking, the image of the drunk lying by the side of the road is a defining trope, not of rural life in general, but of Indians in particular. In the popular imagination, it is Indians who lie in the street, drunken and dirty, and in rural parishes such as the one where I worked, members of the small white community are emphatic in their con- demnations. Whites may drink, they say, but they do not do it so publicly, with such abandon, and especially they do not allow their women to be seen in such sorry states. Exagerated displays of public drunkenness are part and parcel of Indian celebrations, and whites find this behavior amusing and pathetic. Part of the fascination with attending Indian fiestas for tourists comes in the late afternoon, when the road fills with drunken figures, men and women alike: people passed out halfway into the lane, oblivious of the danger, their hats and possessions scattered; uproarious groups laughing and clutching one another, while in another group tempers have soured, men taking haphaz- ard swipes at one another with their fists while women shriek and pull each other's hair, rolling in the mud. Off in odd corners, pairs of people embrace and weep at the joy and pain of their mutual love-usually these are adult siblings, two sisters, or a sister and a brother, now separated by their marriages and living in different communities. This is the strongest and one of the most disquieting images of Indians that are taken away by visitors. These actual sights blend into the more general image of the Drunken Indian, that inex- pressibly sad figure haunting the imagination of the Americas. In public and popular discourses of the Andean nations, this image can serve as a strong indictment of the moral degeneracy of the Indian race.</page><page sequence="6">866 M. J. WEISMANTEL For whites who know Indian communities more intimately, the images of cultural difference and moral inadequacy that can be used to defend racial barriers are more complex, and more closely based upon indigenous culture itself. It is found to be especially reprehensible that Indians drink so much at funerals, for example; and it is true that, while all rituals typically involve heavy drinking, heights of alcohol consumption can be reached at wakes before which all others pale. Paul Rivet's description of a Chimborazo wake of the 1920s as a "veritable orgy of alcoholic spirits" [1926:382, my trans.] would certainly apply to many of the Zum- bagua wakes of the 1980s. Another common phenomenon that whites describe as baffling is the picture of the Indian staggering home from town under an enormous load of bread. My first landlady in Zumbagua, a white woman, explained to me that the Indians were "crazy for bread": they would appear on the doorstep of her bakery and buy two hundred, three hundred bread rolls at a time. For her, selling bread to Indians was very good business, rivalling that of her friend Heloisa who sold cane alcohol. She and her friends fre- quently expressed the opinion that the inordinate Indian appetite for both of these items, which seemed to exceed all bounds of common sense, was proof of an essentially irresponsible approach to life, which in turn was at the root of Indian poverty. As I made contacts in the Indian community and moved out of her house, I found that festivities were indeed begun with the purchase of ex- traordinary amounts of small, round bread rolls, which were handed out like party favors to guests or served in pairs, swimming in bowls of the thick red barley drink known as buda. If we look for the signifiers that mark Indian culture in the realm of food and drink, then, our results are not edifying: Indians like to get falling-down-drunk in public, and they buy enormous quan- tities of cheap white bread. It is easy to interpret these character- istics as expressive, not of a uniquely Andean cultural heritage, but of a social group defined more by its oppression and degradation than by anything else. Drunkenness, after all, is the last refuge of victims of racism and poverty the world over; and white bread rolls and cheap hard liquor are purchased commodities of no particular culinary or cultural interest. Christian reformers condemn their purchase as indulgence in vice and wasteful spending of hard- earned money, while another morality blames not the Indians but small-town whites like my landlady, whose exploitation of helpless</page><page sequence="7">M L N 867 Indians in the relentless pursuit of profit is interpreted as a micro- cosm of the relationship between the First and Third Worlds. On the surface, then, it would seem difficult to defend these customs of buying bread rolls and cane liquor as evidence for an indigenous cultural tradition thriving in the rural Andes. I must further admit that I initially found the cooked foods prepared for celebrations less than edifying as well. Yahuarlocro (blood soup) certainly satisfied my appetite for the exotic. However, it is the first food eaten when the butchering of sheep and llamas for a celebra- tion begins, and having grown up where meat comes from the refrigerator I found it difficult to stomach this festival food, thick and lukewarm and served in a kitchen still reeking with the smells of death. Less problematic for the stomach but more so for my scholarly curiosity, was the festival preparation known as buda. I frequently asked people to describe real or imagined special-occasion meals, and they inevitably mentioned big beautiful bowls of buda. The actual food turned out to be a disappointment. It was the same plain barley gruel as on ordinary days, but colored bright red with achiote (annatto seed) to mark the day as a fiesta. The word itself, from the Spanish boda, wedding, in Quichua carried a general sig- nificance of celebration: the ordinary made special-and it was, in fact, a food I found uncompromisingly ordinary despite its holiday red dress. We are left, then, with four items: an alcoholic beverage which serves to intoxicate to the point of forgetting oneself publicly; bread rolls; and two bowls of liquid, one of cooked blood from a recently-killed animal and one of cooked grains colored red. These signifiers of celebration recur in various combinations throughout the year, but they take on a slightly different form in the most famous Andean ritual involving food and drink: the festival of All Souls, or Finados. Unlike other Indian celebrations, the meal eaten for Finados is popular, in modified form, among white Ecuador- ians of all classes as well. Bread Babies In 1964, the German anthropologist Roswith Hartmann visited two Imbabura cemeteries on November 2nd, and later wrote the fol- lowing description of the scenes she witnessed:</page><page sequence="8">868 M. J. WEISMANTEL While the 'whites' dressed in mourning were busy decorating the graves of their dead with crowns of paper flowers, black, purple, or white, such a crowd had gathered in the indigenous section that scarcely a patch of ground was visible. Around each grave members of the family were seated in groups. Spread out before them ... were the foods specially prepared for the occasion to be eaten in the company of the dead. The typical dish is called in Quechua yana api, made from blue or black maize, another requisite being the so-called bread babies, anthropomor- phic ... figures made from wheat paste and painted various colors ... In the nearby city of Otavalo the indigenous cemetery presented an even more impressive spectacle. Seen from afar, it appeared as a gigan- tic mosaic of bright colors ... thousands of Indians had congregated there . . . [Hartmann 1974:180-181; my trans.] On All Souls day in Ecuador and Peru, bread takes on human form as bread babies: tanda wawakuna [Q] or guaguas de pan [Sp]. It is paired once again with a bowl of liquid cooked grains which are colored, although here the dish is described in Quichua as "black" [yana api], in Spanish as "purple" [colada morada]. These paired symbolic foods, bread in human form and a dark liquid, evoke the symbolism of the Catholic Mass: the Body and Blood of Christ, an image further reinforced by the spoken rituals of the day, when the Mass or fragments of it are recited in the name of the dead. Throughout the Andes, rich and poor, Indian and white alike celebrate this day with a dark sweet maize gruel or drink, embel- lished by the well-to-do with berries and other red or purple fruits and aromatic seasonings, while the poor make do with simpler concoctions; and bakeries from Avenida Amazonas in Quito to the tiniest rural hamlet make "guaguas de pan," bread babies. In con- trast, the same date in Mexico finds no bread babies, no black gruels; the streets are filled instead with vendors of sugar skulls and toy skeletons, colorful and macabre. The European calendar is the one that decreed this date a time for communing with the dead, and these two great civilizations of the New World accepted the invitation readily-but in each place, different aspects of the Eu- ropean tradition resonated with native practices. For the newly converted Aztecs and Maya, confession was the Catholic sacrament most readily understood; in the Andes, it was the symbolism of communion. The transubstantiation of holy Flesh and Blood into ritual foods was easily read according to Andean understandings of the sacred. The Incas, too, paired blood and bread on ritual occasions, as I</page><page sequence="9">M L N 869 will discuss below, but the texts collected by Hartmann (as well as ethnographic data collected in Ecuador by Rivet [1926], Karsten [1930], and Parsons [1945] in earlier decades, and more recently in Peru by Catherine Allen [n.d., 1978, 1988]) suggest that a more important continuity between Christian religion and Andean belief lies in the concept of communion itself. Food is prepared on Finados not simply in memory of the dead, but in order to feed them. In excerpts from Hartmann's texts, people vividly evoke the hungry dead, waiting at the cemetery: Panteon pungupimi shujun nin . .. Nucamanga jacuta rezachihuangui, quinua jacuta carangui, Cebada jacuta mishquihuanga na munanichu, nucaca cachihuan munani nishpa almacunaca nin Nuca abueloca cachihuan na munanichu carca. Mishquihuan munaj carca. Nuca abueloca mishquihuanga na munanichu carca, cachihuan munaj carca nishpami panteonmanga rin. [Hartman 1974:216]. "They say that the souls wait at the door to the cemetery... 'Pray for me giving me meal, give me quinoa meal.' 'I don't want it sweetened, I want it with salt.' That's how they say the souls talk. 'My grandfather wouldn't want it with salt, he wants it with sugar.' 'My grandfather doesn't want it with sugar, he wants it with salt.' That's how people talk as they go to the cemetery." People do not only feed the dead; they also share the meal with them. "Some go saying, let's give drink to the dead soul, and they get really drunk" (Hartmann 1974:189). Catherine Allen was startled to find that during her fieldwork in Sonqo, Peru, she was expected to be able to feed her absent hus- band, away in Lima, through her own eating: "When I tried to say I could not eat so much, Cipriano's teenage daughter cheerfully instructed me, 'ricardoq wigsaman wiqsaykimanta churanki'-put it from your stomach into Rick's" (1978:34). She found that to Andean minds, when the body of a living being is filled to excess, it becomes a conduit through which food or alcohol can be passed on to others with whom one is in contact. In Hartmann's Quichua texts, the distinction between eating and praying for the dead is blurred. An old woman tells her grand- daughter, "make a prayer for me when I die, by cooking make a prayer for me." The girl's mother instructs her, rezaspa micungui, 'pray through eating' or 'eat in order to pray.' The same girl, now grown up, explains Finados ritual to Hartmann saying, 'jacuta reza-</page><page sequence="10">870 M. J. WEISMANTEL chin,' 'they make a prayer with barley meal' (1974:207). In these phrases, the act of sharing and eating food is itself an act of prayer, of establishing communion with the dead. This communion, established through food, is enhanced with alcohol. It is crucial on Finados not only to drink but to get drunk. From a sixteen-year-old girl: "And in the estanco we drink lots, lots of chicha, chicha and trago. We leave filled to overflowing [Spanish balde; Quichua, junda] with chicha" [Hartmann 1974:184, my trans.]. This concept of the overflowing body is one found in Incaic celebrations with their dead as well. Pedro Pizarro described the daily ceremonies to the royal ancestors in Cuzco, capital of the Inca realm, in which drinking and toasting played a major part: To see these people of Cuzco is an amazing thing ... they serve these corpses as I have said, each day taking them all out into the plaza, seating them in a circle each one according to its antiquity.... Also they have before these corpses certain large vessels called verquis, made of gold, silver or clay, as each one pleases, and in them they pour the chicha to give to the dead, showing it to them, making the dead toast the dead, and the dead toast the living and the living the dead.... [quoted in Zuidema 1980:329, my trans.] Another chronicler describes the scene at the festival of Capac Raymi: ... every day such a quantity of people ... came to the plaza, bringing to the festival all their ancestors and dead ... from eight in the morning until the night they were there without leaving the fiestas, and there they ate and drank ... and although what they drank was of root crops and maize yet it was enough to make them drunk ... there were so many people, and so well lubricated, men and women alike, that two wide aqueducts of more than half a vara that went down to the river, which were for carrying rainwater ... ran all the day with urine in such abundance, that it was like a fountain .. ; to see it was like a miracle and something never before seen ... [quoted in Zuidema 1980:337; my trans.]. Drinking, then, and drinking to excess, is an Andean tradition of long-standing importance, and one that, when it was part of the great festivals held in the Inca capital before the conquest, certainly had nothing to do with poverty. Nor, according to Allen, is degra- dation its only meaning now; for at least some Andeans today, drinking still carries these meanings of establishing communication</page><page sequence="11">M L N 871 with other beings in ways that maintain the solidarity of the social unit and the fertility of humans, flocks, and crops, just as the open- ing of the irrigation canals through the drinking festival of Capac Raymi did for the Inca. Chosen Women But while some food practices are of long duration, their meanings are no more static than are the ingredients of the foods and drinks with which they are sustained. No Inca ever drank chicha made of Quaker Oats, a popular concoction today. And the orgies of drunk- enness through which the state celebrated its power to sustain life called into play complex institutions that no longer exist. When the royal Inca rulers drank chicha, it was no ordinary brew that touched their lips, but rather a liquid specially prepared by women consecrated to the task. These acllacuna or "chosen ones" lived in houses inhabited only by women like themselves, into which men might not venture; their lives were dedicated to sacred and royal duties, including the making of fine textiles, the tending of sacred fields of maize, and the making of special foods and drinks out of the harvested ears (Alberti Manzanares 1986). These women were so holy that Garcilaso said of the things made by their hands that the Inca ruler "received them as sacred things, and he and his whole empire held them in greater veneration than the Greeks and Romans would have done if the goddesses Juno, Venus and Pallas had made them." (Garcilaso de la Vega 1966:198). Among the products of their labor were certain small breads, made of cornmeal from the maize they had grown in their sacred gardens. These are the earliest breads mentioned in the written history of the Andes, and the only breads not of European origins. Unlike the Mesoamericans with their tortillas, Andean peo- ple before the Conquest ate their maize and quinua in the form of porridges, soups and stews. Only twice a year, as a ritual act, is it reported that the Inca ate any form of bread: Of the four festivals celebrated by the Inca kings in the city of Cuzco, which was their home, the most solemn was that held in honor of the Sun ... called Intip Raimi, meaning "The solemn feast of the Sun" ... They generally prepared themselves for the Raimi of the Sun by observing a strict fast, eating nothing for three days but a little raw white maize ... the women of the Sun busied themselves with the preparation</page><page sequence="12">872 M. J. WEISMANTEL of enormous quantities of a maizen dough called sancu, of which they made little round loaves the size of an ordinary apple, and it is to be noted that the Indians never ate their corn kneaded and made into loaves except at this festival ... The flour for this bread, and especially that which was to be eaten by the Inca and the members of the royal family, was ground and kneaded by the chosen virgins, the wives of the Sun ... for this bread was regarded as something sacred and not al- lowed to be eaten during the year, but only at this festival which was their feast of feasts. (Garcilaso de la Vega 1966:358) The meal was ground by the chosen women as the male priests sacrificed llamas; it was these two foods together, bread and sacri- ficial meat, that made up the feast with which the Sun regaled his children. On another major feast day, Citua, the bread was actually made with human blood, and the dough was held to have sacred cleansing power: They made two kinds of bread. To the first they added the blood of boys or children of between five and ten, which they obtained by bleeding and not by killing the victims ... Shortly before dawn on the night of the baking, all those who had fasted washed their bodies and took a little of the dough mixed with blood and rubbed it on their ... [bodies] as if cleansing themselves ... This done, the eldest relative, the master of the house, anointed the lintel of the street door with dough, leaving some sticking to it as a sign that the ablution had taken place ... (Garcilaso de la Vega 413-414) The pairing of blood and bread in the Andes, then, stands for both communion and sacrifice, but it has other roots besides the Catholic Mass. And the hundreds of small breads, the size of an apple, which Andean people today buy for their festivals and serve swimming in bowls of red liquid, look somewhat different in the light of their history. In Zumbagua today, bread is not something to eat with ordinary meals, but a food reserved for celebration. Liquor, too, although consumed in an abundance that has startled outsiders from Pizarro to the present, is never served with an ordinary meal but is likewise reserved to mark the extraordinary moment. The shedding of an- imal blood is also an event of significance, the first step in the preparation of a ritual meal that begins with yahuarlocro. Two acts mark the social moment: a man toasts someone with a cup; a woman serves a bowl of food. And although the liquids involved have been flavored with everything from blood to berries, it is maize and especially the intoxicating beer made from maize</page><page sequence="13">M L N 873 that has been the celebratory substance of choice for the longest time and throughout the widest expanse of the Andes. The link between chicha and ritual, it has recently been argued, is at least as old as the first "Great Civilization" of the Andean region, Chavin [900 B.C.] (Burger and Van der Merwe 1990); Hastdorf et al. find that by the thirteenth century A.D., maize pro- duction and chicha brewing had become an important source of political power: ". .. elites were preparing and distributing large quantities of chicha to the populace, as part of a stepped-up pro- cess of social and political alliance-building ..." (1989:13). The cross-cultural data on chiefdoms supports her hypothesis that beer was the centerpiece of a redistributive system that reinforced grow- ing centralized political power in this period (Weismantel 1989). Certainly by historic times the role of maize beer in politics and religion is undeniable. Arriaga, the relentless Spanish extirpator of idolatries, stated emphatically: "The principal offering, the best and most important part of Indian sacrifices is chicha. By it and with it the festivals of the huacas begin. It is everything" [1968:41]. John Murra, especially, has argued for the centrality of maize and chicha rituals in the Inca state (1973). In contemporary peasant communities, drinking rituals are sim- ilarly important; but rather than relationships between elite and commoner, it is reciprocal relationships between households that are celebrated. Even at this level, drinking together is both struc- tured and inherently political. Catherine Allen in her detailed study of the intricacies of the rites that bond kin, friend and neigh- bor, found that drinking rituals do not reinforce equality, but rather serve to emphasize asymmetry between host and recipient, an asymmetry that becomes particularly important when the two are unequal in wealth or status (1988:141-144, and passim). Tom Cummins (1990), whose research on the iconography of qeros (colonial drinking vessels) has led him to investigate Incaic chicha rituals, shows how the imagery of reciprocity associated with drinking rituals was manipulated by the Inca for political ends. Relationships with conquered rulers were reinforced in rituals carefully crafted to express both symmetry and asymmetry, as Gar- cilaso described: Seated on his chair of solid gold which was placed on a gold platform, the Inca used to send his relatives ... to drink in his name to the most eminent representatives of other tribes.... In order to understand their manner of drinking toasts, it must be mentioned that all the In-</page><page sequence="14">874 M. J. WEISMANTEL dians had ... matched drinking vessels in pairs. Whether large or small, they are of the same size and shape and of the same substance, gold, silver, or wood. This was done so that there should be equality in what was drunk. Whoever extended the invitation to drink carried the two vessels in his hand, and if his guest was of lower rank, he offered him the vessel in his left hand ... In such festivities, the first invitation was always from superior to inferior, as a token of favor or regard ... (Garcilaso 363-5) In this context, the role of the chosen women as agents of im- perial power becomes clearer. In royal ritual in the city of Cuzco, the acllas represented both empire and deity; outside of the city, the Inca erected acllawasis, magnificent houses inhabited by the chosen, as symbols of the state. The maize beer produced within the walls of the acllawasi then was used in rituals enacted as the Inca overlords received tribute from their new subjects (Morris 1990). We see chicha, then, serving political ends in a variety of historical contexts: in contemporary peasant communities, it establishes as- symetrical bonds between households; in early prehistory, it ce- mented the power of elites, who used drinking parties as the cen- terpiece in their redistributive networks; in the Inca state, ritual- ized drinking mimicked the reciprocity of peasant rituals, while binding elite subjects to the empire as tributaries. Particular forms of relationship within the productive economy, then, and especially in regard to agriculture, are expressed through drinking rituals. For peasants, festivals are structured around the agricultural calendar, and involve the fruits of one's own labor. Through ritual, a cycle of interdependence is celebrated in which the foods eaten symbolize the earth's fertility as well as the productive force of human society itself. In celebrations, agricul- turalists express the fact that their bodies are literally made of the crops they grow, a connection embodied in the bread dough used to make the 'bread babies' at Finados. Hartmann (1973:194) compares these anthropomorphic breads to enormous human figures made of bread dough in Bolivia de- scribed by Karsten in the 1930s, which were given food and chicha and displayed in the plaza. June Nash (1979:149) also describes the making of a lifesized dough figure of the recently deceased during a Bolivian Finados. Through these dough figures, the dead human body is re-created as an emblem of the life-giving crops that ensure the continued survival of the community. This symbolism is also found in the cult of the mummies among the Inca: these royal</page><page sequence="15">M L N 875 bodies represented both the body politic and the landscape of the Andes itself, and maize was both the symbol and the substance of their powerful flesh. It would seem, then, that much of the significance of maize beer has rested on its power to symbolize the agricultural economy upon which society depended. Today, subsistence crops play less and less of a role in rural diets, and highland agriculture is of ever- decreasing importance in the national economy. The attempt to rescue chicha from its slow decline and make it into a symbol, not only of Indian nationalism, but of a patriotic resurrection of na- tional pride for all Ecuadorians or Peruvians seems to fly in the face of material reality. In Zumbagua today, people depend heavily on their land, and the foods it produces; they celebrate its power to support them each year in the annual round of fiestas, and the symbolism of Finados makes explicit reference to agricultural concerns. The land does not provide all their food, however; they also eat noodles and Quaker Oats and white sugar, and the fetishism of commod- ities is a powerful symbolic system in the parish as well (Weismantel 1988). They very rarely brew chicha, and they make their festival foods using a variety of ingredients: sheep's blood and annatto seeds, locally-produced barley and purchased breads. But indige- nous leaders from the parish and elsewhere in the Sierra claim that, despite the heterogeneity of the products involved, such prac- tices do constitute a living Native American cultural tradition that deserves the recognition of the nation. The long history of chicha demonstrates that it has represented more than one political economy. Twentieth century Imbabura rituals seem to evoke an Inca past, when maize beer, the mummies of the ancestors, and the flowing of liquid through the irrigation canals that water the fields were brought together in a single, ri- otous event. But in the Inca empire, maize and the sophisticated irrigation systems that supported it did not signify the agriculture of ordinary folk, nor were the dead feted on these occasions ordi- nary farmers. An unbridgeable gap existed between commoners and the elites, whose very bodies, nourished on sacred maize and descended from the celestial Sun itself, were made of different stuff than those of ordinary folk, and whose material remains, even after death, must therefore be sustained with the most precious of substances: maize raised within royal compounds, and beer brewed by chosen women who were themselves of royal blood, served in</page><page sequence="16">876 M. J. WEISMANTEL containers of silver and gold. The Inca strove to make maize itself a royal food, distinct from the root crops eaten by peasants. The relationship between a peasant community and its land, then, is only one of the political economies that chicha has been used to represent. The Inca carefully separated rituals involving maize from the sphere of peasant life, making chicha into a symbol of empire. In the Andes today, the social life of chicha is undergo- ing yet another transformation: even as the poor find that such products of highland agriculture make up a smaller and smaller portion of their diet, these foods are taking on a greater symbolic importance as icons of an increasingly militant quest for political representation. Conclusions I began this paper with drunken Indians, as they can be seen sprawled at the roadside throughout the rural Andes. I spoke of the disapproval with which the dominant society views this specta- cle, and then proceeded to give some cultural and historical back- ground on the role of intoxication in the Andean tradition, in search of a more sympathetic interpretation for these inebriates. Increasingly, however, it is members of Andean communities themselves who are rejecting their drunken neighbors, using the same arguments that whites have used against them. This is hap- pening in the context of a growing Protestant evangelism, one of the hallmarks of which is the rejection of both drunkenness and of traditional Andean festivals such as Finados. Rejection of the complex of ideas that imbues alcohol with spe- cial meaning, would seem to signify the end of the millenia-long Andean love for chicha. However, Rebecca Tolen (personal com- munication, 1989), working in an entirely evangelized community in the Colta region of Ecuador, reports that, despite the abandon- ment of Catholic ritual, the new Protestants have a strong interest in maintaining their ethnic traditions. In their celebrations, rounds of ritual toasting are more important then ever, although cane alcohol, the devastatingly strong and unquestionably destructive liquor introduced by whites into the Indian community, has been rejected. The toasts are made with chicha-a chicha brewed to be non-alcoholic. But as to intoxication itself, and the related notion of commu-</page><page sequence="17">M L N 877 nion with other souls, the newly-converted speak of nothing else; once again, as with the imagery of the Catholic Mass, an alien symbolic language introduced into the Andes is being used to ex- press a peculiarly Andean view of the world. Nor have the red soups, the cooked blood, the round breads, or even the maize beer been left behind. Despite the fears of anthropologists that Protes- tantism, like proletarianization, would deal a mortal blow to indig- enous culture, these Protestant Quichua-speakers are among the most militant of the newly politicized indigenous groups of the highlands, the very people who are most involved in reviving im- ages of the Inca past. This ideological effort to resuscitate the Inca utilizes a romantic vision of a shared cultural heritage, several millenia old, underly- ing the practices of rural Andean people today. Most urban, mid- dle-class citizens of the Andean nations, as well as foreigners such as businessmen, development experts, or missionaries who work in rural areas of the Andes, ridicule such ideas. The culture of the rural inhabitants of the Andes, they would argue, is an obviously degraded one that symbolizes nothing but poverty and ignorance. The Incas, in other words, are long dead, and any effort to find their heritage still alive in the food and drink, the rituals and po- etry of their descendants is chasing after chimeras. The anthropological insistence on the existence of lo andino has been, in large part, an effort to defend the people we study against this image of them as degraded and without culture.2 Contrary to stereotypical portrayals of the anthropological endeavor as apolit- ical or worse, many anthropologists working in the Andes have, in their own ineffectual and ineluctably academic way, been trying to document, and so to support, the struggle of indigenous people for cultural autonomy. As the Andean peoples increasingly find their own voice, our task is changing and perhaps becoming more dif- ficult, as the role of the neutral observer becomes impossible to sustain. Anthropologists are not the only ones writing about chicha, bread babies, and other aspects of indigenous culture; paradoxically, this 2 This thought, and the comments on lo andino that open this paper, are the result of conversations with members of the panel and the audience at the session on "Imagined Communities of the Andes" organized by Raquel Ackerman for the 1991 American Ethnological Society meetings in Charleston, South Carolina.

WEISMANTEL makes how we write about such topics more important than ever, because what we say can have political meanings that are far from our intentions. Those of us who write from a tranquil vantage point in Europe or North America, must be careful, in defining our positions, not to let debates generated within the academy, such as the critique of Orientalism, overshadow our awareness of the role of scholarly writings in the volatile politics of the Andean nations themselves. And certainly, before we mourn the death of Andean culture, we must make sure that the corpse is not standing behind us like an Inca mummy, drinking chicha with his living descendants. As the economy of the Andes changes, those aspects of Andean beliefs about food and drink that express extinct eco- nomic relationships are disappearing. But as chicha ceases to be the drink of farmers, it has nevertheless, as it did for the Inca, become a liquid of potent power in the politics of the state and a rousing symbol of the strength of the Andean people.
