Habibi University of Saskatchewan Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT This paper compares the characteristics of a high- precision hydrostatic actuator to that of conventional hydraulic systems using servovalves. Servovalve controlled hydraulic actuators retain their market share as they provide precision movement and offer a very high torque to mass ratio at the final actuation point. The input current/output torque relationship of a conventional hydraulic actuation system is reviewed in a robotic context. This relationship is summarized by a mathematical model that can be expressed in a generalized form. This model is used for the analysis of flow and dynamic characteristics. The design and modeling of a recently proposed high- performance hydrostatic actuation system referred to as the ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA) is briefly reviewed. A prototype of this actuator has been produced and has demonstrated a comparable performance to servovalve controlled conventional hydraulic systems. The suitability of EHA and its ability to present an alternative to servovalve controlled hydraulic systems is assessed. In this paper the characteristics of the two systems are compared theoretically and by reference to experimental results. 1. INTRODUCTION Heavy duty industrial systems use hydraulic actuation which offers a large torque for a comparatively small final actuator size. Hydraulic actuation systems and components have been extensively studied and may be broadly categorized as valve controlled or pump controlled, [1,2,3] . Applications requiring precision movement of heavy loads typically use the valve- controlled hydraulic system which consists of a centralized supply system, hydraulic valves, and actuators, as shown in Figure 1 . The centralized supply system is used to provide a supply of constant pressure hydraulic oil. In general, flexible hoses connect the supply to a valve, from where solid tubing directs the flow to an actuator. The hydraulic valve is used as a control element and regulates the flow to and from the supply system. Supply systems are composed of a hydraulic pump, an accumulator, a relief valve, a cooling sub- circuit, an accumulator loading/unloading sub-circuit, check valves and oil filters. The oil reservoir is large and opened to atmospheric pressure. Actua 1 ' 1 1 1~~! i Fl : Valve Suppl; -trn- I Systei A 4 - 1. Hydraulic cylinder f~~1 - À 5 2. Control valve i j_ 3.

Oil tank Figure 1: Valve controlled hydraulic actuation system Pump controlled hydraulic circuits are an alternative to valve controlled systems and, are generally configured in a hydrostatic form. In this form, actuation is achieved by direct coupling of hydraulic pump and hydraulic motor. As a result, the actuator pressure varies with the. pump flow and there are no requirements for oil reservoirs or electrohydraulic servovalves, [4,5,6,7,8,9].

Symmetrical actuators can be rotary or linear as shown in Figure 3. Actuator Chamber 1 at Pressure a) Rotary t&gt;) Linear Figure 3: Symmetrical Actuators In industrial applications, single-rod asymmetrical cylinders are predominantly used. The asymmetry of the actuator results in different characteristics for the forward and reverse stroke directions in the following: • maximum output torque, • maximum speed, • quantity of hydraulic fluid displaced by the two chambers, and • dynamic response and characteristics of the actuator. If an asymmetrical actuator is used, the circuit complexity of hydrostatic systems is considerably increased as shown in Figure 4, [10,11]. The proposed solutions involve using two mechanically coupled pumps that allow a different flow according to the stroke direction. Figure 4: Hydrostatic System using an Asymmetrical Linear Actuator Hydrostatic transmission has been used as an alternative to servovalve controlled conventional actuation system when the requirement for positional accuracy is not very stringent, [4,5]. Most hydrostatic circuits use a constant speed piston pump with variable displacement. The movement of the hydraulic actuator is regulated by moving a swash plate on the pump that changes the magnitude and direction of flow. These circuits are energy inefficient, as the pump continuously runs irrespective of the motion of the actuator. An alternative strategy is to vary the flow by changing the speed and direction of a fixed displacement pump, [4,8]. However, the commercial progress of such hydrostatic actuation has been affected by the presence of a dead- band (Figure 5) with an effect similar to backlash, thus limiting the positional accuracy and stability of this type of system. The effect of the deadband and the limited accuracy of such systems can be resolved by using a high gain inner-loop flow control strategy, [12], The effect of this control strategy has been practically demonstrated by a prototype of a hydrostatic actuation system referred to as the ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA). The circuit diagram of EHA is shown in Figure 6 and, its main constituents are: • An electrical motor. • A bi-directional pump. • A symmetrical actuator. • Pressure and position sensors. • Accumulator and related sub-circuit. • Filtering sub-circuits. Figure 5: Dead-band in Hydrostatic Actuation, [8] Figure 6: ElectroHydraulic Actuator In this system, the electrical motor is coupled to the bi- directional pump that would cause oil flow and pressure changes in the hydraulic actuator. The pressure difference in the actuator chambers in tum results in exertion of force on the external load and the movement of this load according to the speed and direction of the pump. A prototype of EHA has demonstrated a high level of performance and an ability of moving a load of 20 Kg with critical damping at an accuracy of 10 Micron 232</page><page sequence="3">(M.m). This level of performance broadens the application of hydrostatic transmission to those requiring precise motion. This paper presents a comparison of conventional hydraulic systems and the ElectroHydraulic Actuator (EHA). This comparison is made in the context of robotics and the application of the above actuation systems to a hydraulic industrial robot referred to as the Workmaster. The existing design of the Workmaster robot (Figure 7) has six degrees of freedom and uses conventional servovalve controlled hydraulic actuation with a supply pressure of 150 Bar. Axes 1,4,5 and 6 of the robot use rotary actuators and, axes 2 and 3 are actuated by asymmetrical pistons. A complete multivariable analysis of this robot is presented in [13]. In this paper we review the dynamics of axis 1 which uses a rotary actuator at the base joint, and consider replacing its valve-controlled conventional actuation system with EHA. The mathematical modeling of a single axis of Workmaster and its dynamic analysis are presented in sections 2 and 3. In Section 4, the application of EHA to a single axis of Workmaster is considered. A comparison of the two actuation systems is made in Section 5. The concluding remarks are contained in Section 6. Table 1 contains the nomenclature. Figure 7: Workmaster Robot 2. LINKAGE MODEL OF HYDRAULIC ROBOTS The industrial robot forming the subject of this paper is considered as a series of nearly rigid bodies (or links) in a kinematic chain. Various techniques have been proposed for the systematic derivation of the linkage model of robot manipulators, [14]. The dynamic model can be described by: 1 =[M&lt;ÊM+fJesÍ) (1) where £ = and r = [r1,...,T/(]rare the corresponding vectors of joint angles and torques. [m(0)] is the inertia matrix and, fcSk&gt; 0) is a torque vector comprising centrifugal, coriolis, friction and gravitational components. The dynamic model of an anthropomorphic robot manipulator varies with link position, velocity and acceleration. Robot manipulators are multivariable configuration dependent systems and should benefit from specific control techniques which are, however, computationally demanding. The computed torque control technique is often used for robot control and attempts to linearize the dynamics of the manipulator by using model based feedback and/or feedforward compensation. Given the dynamic model of equation (1), the application of a computed torque controller to the Workmaster hydraulic robot is provided in detail in [13]. From Figure 7, axis 1 of the Workmaster robot provides base rotation and uses a rotary symmetrical actuator shown in Figure 3a. Given that there are no gravitational torques acting on this axis, for a fixed configuration of the robot (i.e. all other joints being stationary), equation (1) becomes a single input single output function, with the inertia term for axis 1, Mu(0), being constant and, its associated fcgi (0,0) being zero. 3. MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF CONVENTIONAL HYDRAULIC ACTUATION SYSTEM The input current/output torque relationship of hydraulic actuators can be accurately represented as first order approximation, [13]. Herein, this mathematical model is used to examine the dynamic characteristics of the actuation system of axis 1 of Workmaster. Experimental data is provided in support of theoretical analysis. Workmaster is a heavy duty industrial robot that uses conventional hydraulic actuation with a centralized hydraulic power supply. Although the purpose of the power supply is to provide hydraulic oil at a constant pressure, in practice, the dynamics of the supply system and limitations in power and accumulator capacity, combined with flexing of the hoses, can lead to variation of supply pressure. In the case of the Workmaster robot, the supply pressure variation is very significant when four joints are moved simultaneously as shown in Figure 8. It is shown in [13] that the dynamics of the supply system does not need to be modeled and can be compensated in real time through the measurement and feedback of the supply pressure. In this section, the following are therefore considered: • modeling of the electrohydraulic servovalve, • modeling of Workmasteťs hydraulic actuator of axis 1 (rotary), • integration of the linkage dynamics with the actuation system sub-model, and • compensation of the supply dynamics by using pressure feedback. 233</page><page sequence="4">Legend: MV_move Single Joinunove l.600e+07 1.400e*07 / I.200e+07 ' / 1.000e+07 8.000e+06 6.000C+06 4.000e+06 2.000c+06 0.000e+00 L i 1 - 0.000 1.500 3.000 4300 6.000 time Figure 8: Variation of the Supply Pressure 3.1 ELECTROHYDRAULIC SERVOVALVE MODEL The electrohydraulic servovalve is used to direct the flow from the power supply to the actuator. The servovalve is composed of a permanent magnet torque motor and a spool. These control the flow through the valve, [2]. The primary flows through the valve, qx and q2 as depicted in Fig 9, can be treated as flow through a sharp- edged orifice. By applying Bernoulli's and continuity equations, the flow q can be expressed in terms of the input current as: g = KsvIvyfĀP (2.) where A P is the difference in pressure across the orifice, /„ is the input current to the valve, and Ksv is a constant. The overlap of land in the case of the secondary flows, q2 and qA, renders the turbulent orifice flow principle unsuitable for their calculation. The secondary flows are treated as leakage with a typical characteristic shown in Fig 10, [15]. They can be assumed equal due to the symmetry of the valve, and can be represented as a function , F(lv), of the input current/,, .

Note that if the direction of the valve displacement is reversed, q3 and q4 become the primary flows and the positions of Px and P2 must be swapped in equation (13). Equation (13) can be expressed in a multivariable form and, for example if applied to the first four axes of the workmaster robot, it would be: "f,ļ lEx o oT/v.l I"*,, 0 0 0 Té/ f2 _ o e2 o o h2 _ ~ o *„2 o o e2 f3 ~ 0 0 e3 o /Vj ~ _ o 0 kVi 0 03 fj [o 0 0 £4J[/VJ [o 0 0 *v4Jé4 0 0 OT, ^ 0 yr2 0 0 T2 ^10 ^ 0 0 y3 0 T3 0 0 0 y/4_ T4 235</page><page sequence="6">Legend: Pj - P2 -.-P1+P2 ...P,-P2 2E7 [ Z zzz I 1E7 ^ A' ļ IV/*. ^ A' V IV/*. „ =3 ' / ' 8 0 ' / ' / '/ V/ &lt;L&gt; ». ; S-. • ; Pm -v- -IE'/ 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Time (mS) Figure 11: Axis 1 Simulated Chamber Pressures Defining Vk as the matrix of coefficients of friction, T is obtained from the linkage dynamic model of equation (1) as: ! = [a/(£)I+/^M+M (17.)

Considering a SISO model of axis one, i.e. /=1, for a fixed configuration as discussed in Section 2 and assuming a constant Vk , then from equation (17) t, = M n(ô)9, + Vk¡é, . Equation (19) subsequently reduces to: Ö] = M,(0)-,(£i/v, + (20.)

The change in pressure in the two chambers of the actuator are nearly equal in magnitude during a stroke, but opposite in sign or direction (Figure 11). Labeling chamber pressure variation and the mean pressure as PA and Pm P 1 + P respectively, from Figure 11, Pm = 1 2 . Following convention, the magnitude of Pm is assumed constant and equal to Ps /2 where Ps is the supply pressure. The variations of the chamber pressures with respect to Pm are then defined as Px-Pm+ PA and P2=Pm-PA&lt; P 1 - P resulting in PA = 1 2 . Neglecting the return pressure due to its comparatively small value: 2^Ç^pa and Jpt-px -JĶ-o.

' KVi+Vk¥i 3.4 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS Inspection of equation (12) reveals that the input/torque relationship of the hydraulic actuation system is nonlinear and changes according to the variations of the supply and chamber pressures. The dynamics of the supply system are reflected by the supply pressure and impact the current multiplier [EJ. The variation of the current multiplier of axis 1 of the Workmaster robot during a step move is shown in Figure 12. This variation is dynamically significant and could result in performance degradation. Habibi and Richards use the mathematical model of equation (19) and pressure feedback in the design of a computed torque multivariable controller for the first four axes of the Workmaster robot. Here, the dynamics of the supply system is compensated by measuring the supply pressure and scaling the input current accordingly. The computed torque control technique is commonly used in robot control and attempts to linearize the dynamics of the manipulator by using model based feedback and/or feedforward compensation. In [13], the controller compensates for the configuration dependence and cross-coupling torques through an input current which, for a trajectory following mode with the demanded trajectory profiles of Figure 13, is defined as: K, =(M„(o'ö'd -Xj-Xve-Xpë +¿My(£)9y j*ì +fcgi MH 7=1 7=1 +/cg&amp;tí+čtA+W'£i (28.)

Referring to equations (6), (7) and (10), the term k^dļ/Ēj can be directly linked to the volumetric flow occurring in the actuator. 237</page><page sequence="8">This can be explained conceptually as the leakage flow term in equation (12) is comparatively negligible due to the small magnitude of the leakage flow in the system. Furthermore, from a multivariable perspective, the resulting matrix | Kv, J due to volumetric flow in equation (16) is diagonal and does not introduce cross coupling effects into the dynamic system. In fact, given its comparatively large decoupled dynamic significance, it renders the overall system diagonally dominant for any linearized configuration of the robot. It therefore reduces the cross coupling effects in the hydraulic robot introduced by the coupled leakage flow term [yr]r . 3.5 SUMMARY OF CHARACTERISTICS Conventional servovalve controlled hydraulic systems have a number important advantages that can be generalized as: Volumetric flow within hydraulic actuators results in a dominant uncoupled dynamic effect that reduces the effect of cross coupling in a multivariable system. Hydraulic manipulators are more decoupled than their electrical counter-part (in mathematical terms, if a linearized transfer function is obtained for any configuration of a hydraulic manipulator, this transfer function is likely to be diagonally dominant and, the volumetric flow reduces the effects of cross-coupling). This is a unique feature that results in a significant improvement in the performance of hydraulic manipulators by reducing the effects of cross-coupling torque. Hydraulic actuators have a significantly higher torque/mass ratio in comparison to electrical actuators (between 10-30 times higher). Hydraulic manipulators can therefore handle large loads for a comparatively smaller overall size. Conventional hydraulic systems have a number of disadvantages that can be summarized as: • Requirement for a centralized power system and lack of modularity. • Fluctuations in the supposedly constant supply pressure. • Leakage. • Large size of the supply unit due to the requirement for a reservoir. • Noise. • Low energy efficiency: the hydraulic pump continuously runs at a constant speed irrespective of the operating conditions in order to maintain a constant supply pressure. In the following sections, we consider the use of EHA as a potential replacement for conventional servovalve controlled hydraulic systems. 4. MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF EHA The hydraulic pump in EHA is the main control element and converts mechanical energy received from the electric motor to fluid flow. Referring to Figure 6, the EHA system can be divided into two hydraulic sub-circuits: • a high pressure outer circuit connected to the symmetrical linear actuator, and • an inner circuit that employs the low-pressure accumulator. The inner-circuit (or accumulator sub-circuit) prevents cavitation and replaces leakage losses. During normal operation, the inner-circuit will have negligible effect on the dynamic performance of EHA and the pump/actuator flow may be assumed equal. 4.1 EHA'S BANDWIDTH Assuming that a rotary symmetrical actuator is used in the design of EHA and, using the actuator model specified by equations (6) and (7), the flow equations relating the pump and actuator flows for EHA may be specified as [2,4]: ( Q = D p o) p -Ç(.P,-Pb)-^^'ÀQ1= * ' " - + ^- dt + L(Pl-P2)) 1 '^° Q = p o) p * ' " ßt dt J [ - dt + ß, dt + 1 2;J (31.) (32.) where, pipe elasticity is considered negligible and, Vx=vm+Dae and v2=vm-Dae. A prototype of EHA that could be used for actuation of joint 1 of Workmaster is depicted in Figures 15 and 16. In this prototype, the filtering sub-circuit is not implemented and, due to the symmetry of EHA, the pump/actuator pipe connection is modeled as a pressure drop which is a function of flow.

In the prototype of EHA, the hydraulic pump is driven by a high performance three phase AC star-connected electrical motor. The control strategy used is critical to the performance of EHA and involves two control loops. A high-gain inner-loop controller is used to regulate the speed of the electrical motor (pumping) and hence provide an accurate control over pump flow. This flow control strategy desensitizes the system to deadband caused by friction at the pump motor interface, [12]. The outer-loop controller allows precision control of the output variable which in this case is the load position, [12]. For the inner-loop controller, a proportional-integral strategy is used for speed control such that the compensator transfer function is obtained as: Gcs=^ + *±j resulting in the following relationship between the input voltage to the motor and the demanded motor speed: Vc=Gcs(a&gt;d-(op) (46.) The torque generated by the motor is characterized by Tm = Kclc-Katcop. Given that the motor is connected directly to the pump, the torque exerted on the pump is given by, [4]: Tm =Jpm(òp +(KPvlsc +Kfiic)a&gt;p +Tdb + Dp(Pa-Pb) (47.) Where TDB denotes deadband due to friction at the pump/motor interface. The relationship between the field current and the input voltage of the three phase motor can be modeled by a first order transfer function such that: lc = G¡VC where: c 1 _ URc .

Since Ppipe can be expressed as a function of pump flow, the positional accuracy of EHA is determined by the term G2Dp^-2KPiPeDP)rDB of equation (50). By choosing DEN (s) large inner and outer loop controller gains such that GcsK^K^ »G-2k^dp)Tdb the positional accuracy of EHA can be made comparable to conventional hydraulic actuation as demonstrated by its prototype described in [12], The positional accuracy of this prototype is 10 microns limited by its encoder resolution. 4.3 EHA'S DECOUPLING CHARACTERISTICS Inspection of equation (36) and its comparison to equation (12) suggests that the digonal dominance that exists in multivariable servovalve driven hydraulic systems could also be present in multivariable systems actuated by EHA. Intuitively however, it can be argued that this effect cannot be present in EHA, as follows. In conventional hydraulic systems, their 'natural' decoupling is not only due to the volumetric flow but also due to the presence of a supply of oil at a constant pressure. In other words, conventional hydraulic systems maintain a supply of energy in the form of high pressure hydraulic oil and, the servovalve simply taps into this source of energy which has already been generated. If the supply system is indeed constant, cross-coupling effects do not affect the supply pressure. With correct sizing of the supply system the supply pressure can indeed remain constant thus leaving the only source of cross-coupling as in equation (16) (note that the drop in the supply pressure in figure 8 is caused by inadequate sizing of the accumulator/pump capacities which are unable to meet the flow demand given a multi-axis step movement). Since dynamic significance of this term [yr]r which is made up of leakage coefficients of the hydraulic system is considerably less than that of the volumetric flow term [tfv]9 (which is decoupled), use of conventional hydraulic in a multi-input multi-output system is likely to result in "natural" decoupling. EHA however does not 240</page><page sequence="11">benefit from a constant supply of energy and, pressure is built up in the system by the variable-speed pumping action. Intuitively it can therefore be argued that the pumping action will be affected by cross-coupling torques and, that diagonal dominance can only be achieved through adequate sizing of the pump/motor combination. This conclusion can be confirmed through a mathematical analysis as follows. The block diagram of EHA for a single axis can be constructed from equations (35), (41) and (48) as depicted in Figure 17. Inspection of this diagram indicates that in addition to the coupling effect in the hydraulic circuit caused by WehaY. (equation (40)), further coupling is introduced into the system due to the presence of the dynamic loop with n gain - - which results from the term Dp(Pa -Pb) in the Da pump motor characteristic of equation (47). More specifically, EHA's coupling characteristics in a multi- input multi-output robotic system can be compared to conventional hydraulic systems by considering equation (47) such that given an input current lc to the motor: KcIe =Jpm&lt;bp +(KPvisc+K/ric)cop +Tdb + Dp(Pa -P„) (52.)

Due to the Da lack of a constant supply pressure, an additional cross- coupling effect is introduced in the EHA and, this cross- coupling is considerably more significant than conventional hydraulic systems as it is independent of leakage flow. This additional coupling is proportional to DP the ratio -ģ- and is influenced by the control strategy (equation (49)). This effect has to be dealt by using high inner-loop gains and with by proper sizing of the pump/motor subsystem in relation to the hydraulic gain. ». „ D° I ļ Tdb a I i . v"&gt;ļ 1 I I i 1 i 6 -^OH k~ IO I i KQ -ÉQ&gt; 1 i*j Dp(i~4kp,ß)p) ļ^o&gt; yjiztí &gt; ¿ ! !-► _À jí 1 1 1 I 1 jk ßA'a 2 D„) 1 1 L_U I 1 Da 1« Figure 17: Linearized EHA Model Block Diagram 241</page><page sequence="12">4.4 E H A'S SUMMARY OF CHARACTERISTICS EHA is a high performance actuation system that can present a powerful alternative to conventional hydraulic systems in certain niche industrial sectors. It combines the key benefits of modularity and having a torque/mass ratio at the final actuator size which is comparable to conventional hydraulic systems. The modularity of EHA allows the building of this device as a single lumped hydraulic part which, combined with established sealing strategies of the aerospace industry, could nearly alleviate external leakage. In addition to modularity, lack of a centralized supply system results in: • reduced noise, • substantial increase in energy efficiency (as the pump will not be running continuously), • reduced overall size and weight (no need for bulky reservoir), and • simplicity of control as EHA is more linear in its dynamic characteristics as it does not use an electrohydraulic servovalve that has a highly nonlinear characteristic (note that this analysis only pertains to servovalves governed by equation (2)). Its disadvantages compared to conventional hydraulic systems are: I V • the bandwidth of EHA is .2- times less that 1 the bandwidth of a comparable conventional hydraulic system, • EHA is more susceptible to cross-coupling effects in a multivariable system. Potential areas of application for EHA are in the aerospace, mining and robotic sectors. 5. CONCLUSION This paper presents a mathematical model of a conventional servovalve controlled hydraulic system and compares it to the model of a hydrostatic actuation system referred to as EHA. The performance of the two systems are compared by considering a robotic application. It is concluded EHA provides a number of advantages as it provides a compact and modular design that can meet performance requirements previously mainly satisfied by conventional hydraulic systems. The areas where EHA is comparatively deficient are its cross- coupling characteristics and bandwidth. REFERENCES 1. Blackburn J. F., Reethof G. and Shearer J. L.
