Baird Abstract In her book, Chugach Prehistory: The Archaeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska, Frederica de Laguna hypothesized that the pictographs of Prince William Sound "find their clos- est analogy in the Eskimo pictographs of Cook Inlet" (de Laguna 1956:109). Some 60 years after de Laguna conducted extensive surveys and recorded pre-contact pictographs from coastal sites in Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, Baird (2003) completed analyses of two pictograph sites located in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve and compared these data to data collected from pictograph sites located along the shores of Prince William Sound. Although the imagery at the Lake Clark pictograph sites shows stylistic similarities to pictographs in Prince William Sound, there are notable differences between the pictograph assemblages and the physical struc- ture and contents of the sites from these two regions. Introduction In the 1930s, Frederica de Laguna surveyed coastal archaeological sites throughout Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound to establish the identity, extent, and timing of human occupations in these regions. De Laguna's pioneering investigations and her large-scale excavations (e.g., Palugvik, Cottonwood Creek, Yukon Island) generated con- siderable archaeological and ethnographic data and inspired subsequent studies of these regions (e.g., Workman 1998; Yarborough 2000). De Lagu- na's systematic reporting and study of the pre- contact pictographs found in these regions (de Laguna 1934, 1956) are less frequently discussed. She hypothesized that the pictographs of Prince William Sound "find their closest analogy in the Eskimo pictographs of Cook Inlet" (de Laguna 1956:109). In 2002, 1 met with Dr. de Laguna at her home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania to discuss my work in Lake Clark, her survey of pictograph sites in outer Cook Inlet, and her opinion about rela- tionships between the Cook Inlet and Prince Wil- liam Sound pictographs. Although she had not vis- ited or known about 49-SEL-006 during her survey of the southwestern shore of Cook Inlet, she had since learned about the material and thought the imagery closely resembled pictographs from Tux- edni Bay. In our discussions about possible con- nections between the corpus of pictographic imag- ery from the Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound regions she suggested that the imagery of these two regions should be analyzed more closely.

De Laguna (1956:108-109) hypothesized: Whatever explanation we favor, it is clear that the paintings of Prince William Sound find their clos- est analogy in the Eskimo pictographs of Cook Inlet. At the same time the Chugach pictographs stand closer than the Cook Inlet pictures to the Kodiak petroglyphs and to the pictographs of the southern Kwakiutl and Salish, and also to the petroglyphs of the Tlingit and other Northwest Coast tribes. The Cook Inlet and Chugach paint- ings are also very similar to the Tena pictures in the Tanana Valley, (de Laguna 1956:108-9) To facilitate understanding the relationships be- tween these regions, this paper compares what we know of the outer Cook Inlet pictograph sites with new data the author collected from four pic- tograph sites located in coastal sites in Prince Wil- liam Sound. This paper argues that although the imagery from Cook Inlet pictograph sites shows significant stylistic similarities to pictographs in Prince Wil- liam Sound, there are distinct differences as well. The paper begins with a brief discussion of de La- guna's investigations of four "rock painting" sites in the coastal regions of Outer Cook Inlet and my more recent work at Tuxedni Bay and 49-SEL-006. Then de Laguna's surveys of four pictograph sites in coastal regions of Prince William Sound are de- scribed, including descriptions of site types and 2005 field investigations of these sites. The final section compares images illustrated in de Laguna's (1934, 1956) monographs to investigate degrees of similarity or difference and considers whether commonalities in style indicate a common eth- nic affiliation. Due to the sensitive nature of these sites and confidentiality agreements between the author and Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Chugach National Forest, and Chugach Alaska Cor- poration, site locations, site names, and pictograph images cannot be reproduced here, but de Laguna's (1934, 1956) published materials can be discussed. Pictographs from Coastal Sites in Cook Inlet In her book The Archaeology of Cook Inlet, Alaska de Laguna estimated that she illustrated approx- imately half of the pictographs from four "rock painting" sites: Indian Island, Bear Island, and Sadie Cove, located along the eastern shores of Kachemak Bay, and Tuxedni Bay located on the southwestern shore of Cook Inlet (de Laguna 1934:150). The description of the sites presented here is organized by location, beginning with the pictograph sites de Laguna reported from Kache- mak Bay. Although she did not visit 49-SEL-006 during her survey of the southwestern shore of Cook Inlet, a description of the site is included here for comparative purposes. A comprehensive study of 49-SEL-006 is available elsewhere (Baird 2003, 2004). Pictograph Sites from the Eastern Shores of Kachemak Bay Indian Island Indian Island is an archaeological site located in a rock shelter on the southeastern shore of Kache- mak Bay (de Laguna 1934:25). It appears from the site description that de Laguna excavated within a shell midden to a depth of at least 1 m2. Al- though she could not establish the culture period, she suspected that the lower layer was of "signifi- cant age." The artifact inventory included a barbed iron head and a harpoon head excavated from the upper "modern" layer, approximately .4 m be- low ground surface. Below the modern level in the older "Eskimo" layer, approximately 1 m below ground surface, de Laguna (1934:25) found a bone pin, a needle-sharpener made from red shale, and a bone awl. The pictographs at this site consist of 30 vertical stripes of paint on the overhang of the rock shelter. De Laguna (1934:25) suggested that the images were of "considerable age" and likely associated with the older deposits. Bear Island (49-SEL-036) Bear Island (49-SEL-036) consists of shell midden deposits and pictographs located in a rock shel- ter a few kilometers south of the Indian Island pictograph site. In 1930, de Laguna excavated a small area within the midden and found "flowered china" approximately 0.1 m below surface and an- imal bones from the older levels, approximately 0.46 m below surface (de Laguna 1934: 24). De La- guna recorded 24 images that include 2 anthro- pomorphs, 19 zoomorphs, and 1 boat (de Laguna 1934:150). Of interest were the numerous images of sea mammals, a few with indications of attached bladders, harpoons, or darts (see de Laguna 1934: Plate 66G). Sadie Cove (49-SEL-005) Sadie Cove (49-SEL-005), located on the south cen- tral shore of Kachemak Bay, approximately 20 ki- lometers from the Bear Island pictograph site, is a small pictograph site. The small cave is lo- cated near a stream and tidewaters flood the cave</page><page sequence="3">1 38 Arctic Anthropology 43:2 floor. The pictographs show a cluster of breach- ing whales and land mammals that de Laguna (1934:153) described: The paintings at Sadie Cove [Plate 68] are the most interesting ... for they offer the only example of true composition. They are larger than those of Bear Island. Their size and the motif of the leaping whale points toward Tuxedni Bay. Only one group of paintings was found There were doubtless four whales originally, and the upper band, com- posed like the lower of highly conventionalized land animals, formerly extended across the whole group. The whales are blackfìsh, very well drawn, and in characteristic action. The land animals, how- ever, cannot be identified, (de Laguna 1934:153) Having introduced the pictograph sites reported by de Laguna from coastal sites in Kachemak Bay, the paper now discusses two pictograph sites located in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve that formed the basis of my Master's research. Pictograph Sites on the Southcentral Shores of Outer Cook Inlet Tuxedni Bay (49-KEN-229) Tuxedni Bay is a pictograph site with buried ar- chaeological deposits in a rock shelter located within Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. The site was first reported by Frederica de La- guna (1934) and was further documented by Den- nis Griffin (1989a), Steven Klingler (1993), Melissa Baird (2003), and Monica Shah (2006). The rock shelter is approximately 15 m X 10 m and is located on a terrace at approximately 12 m asl. The granodiorite rock face has numerous visible fracture lines and large rocks litter the base of the rock shelter (Riehle 2006; Shah 2006:13). In 1932, de Laguna excavated approximately 1 m2of a deep deposit at the base of the pictographs within the rockfall area that included animal remains of "seal and porpoise (especially the mastoid bones), bear, porcupine, ground squirrel, and duck, be- sides a few clam and whelk shells" (de Laguna 1934:138). The exact volume of material excavated could not be determined from her report. In 2002, Jeanne Schaaf collected wood charcoal with a soil probe from a depth of 9-15 cm below the surface directly below what has been interpreted as the raven's foot pictograph. The samples yielded un- calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates of 490 ± 40 B.P. (Beta 186616, wood), or cal A.D. 1400 to A.D. 1460, and 460 ± 50 B.P. (Beta 186617, wood), or cal A.D. 1410 to A.D. 1500, indicating that this site contains data relevant to the Late Prehistoric pe- riod (A.D. 500 -contact) (Schaaf personal com- munication, 2005). At this time, we cannot defin- itively associate the pictographs with the human activity that resulted in the subsurface deposits within the rock shelter. Tuxedni Bay contains 26 pictograph im- ages that include anthropomorphs, zoomorphs, boats, and abstract images distributed on approx- imately a 4 m X 3 m area of the rock face and are painted with a brick-red color pigment that was identified as iron ochre, probably hematite (Shah 2006:18). In addition, there were several stains, or amorphous areas that may have been used to mix paints. De Laguna (1934:149,150-151) illustrated 21 pictographs and proposed that they were the "work of Eskimo" and of "considerable antiquity." The anthropomorphs include three types of body shapes: inverted triangle, elongated rectangu- lar torso, and rounded torso. No anthropomorphs have distinguishing facial features, body decora- tions, or ornamentation. One figure, however, ap- pears to be holding a club, possibly a whaling weapon. The anthropomorphic pictographs, in general, are symmetrical, though not identical. Similar to the symmetry of a human face or fig- ure, the sides look similar, but on closer inspec- tion the two sides reveal subtle differences. The aesthetic preference for symmetry or asymmetry in design was explored by Desson (1995:329) in her analysis of nineteenth and twentieth century Alu- tiiq masks. Desson noted that symmetry in con- struction, color, and design were common features in the masks from the Kodiak and Alaska Penin- sula regions, whereas asymmetry was preferred in Prince William Sound (Desson 1995:329). Nine zoomorphic figures are found at Tuxedni Bay and sea mammals make up a majority of the im- ages. Three images have body shapes and fin place- ment that are suggestive of cetaceans, possibly killer whales [Oremus orca) and three other figures have body types suggestive of pinnipeds. Two images are indistinct but could be interpreted as cetaceans, sea mammals, or birds. A few of the zoomorphic figures appear to indicate motion and could represent sea mammals swimming, leaping, or diving. Because some of the figures were suggestive of whales, de Laguna (1934:154 footnote) hypothesized that they were made by "whalers or by shamans." One of the most visible and prominent picto- graphs at the site is what de Laguna interpreted as a raven's track or foot. She suggested that this sym- bol was of totemic importance and could be the "conventionalized symbol used by the Eskimo of Bering Strait" (1934:151; Plate 62B). De Laguna (1934:151) proposed that because both the Eyak and the Dena'ina of Cook Inlet "possessed the dual social organization of eagle (or wolf) and ra- ven moieties" then it would be reasonable to as- sume that the use of raven as a symbol would be significant. There are five images of boats at Tuxedni Bay: two are large multi-occupant boats, possibly umi- aks and three are small kayaks. One image is of a crescent-shaped boat with an abstract anthropo- morph occupant that de Laguna (1934:152) pro-</page><page sequence="4">Baird: The Study of Pre-Contact Pictographs 1 39 posed could represent a kayaker wearing a hunt- ing hat or a helmet with a brim. This hunting hat is similar in shape and style to the "hollowed-out hat" worn by seal hunters of Kodiak Island and the Chugach of Prince William Sound (Black 1991:23). The Tuxedni Bay pictograph assemblage is similar to the pictograph assemblage at Site 49-SEL-006 as will be discussed next. Site 49-SEL-006 Site 49-SEL-006, a pictograph site located on the south central shore of Cook Inlet, within Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, is located ap- proximately 50 km from the Tuxedni Bay site. Site 49-SEL-006 is located in a rock shelter along the northern shore of a glacially carved bay. Historic and late prehistoric Dena'ina house depressions are located nearby (Griffin 1989b; Klingler 1993). The site was first reported by Joan Townsend (1968, 1969), and was further documented by Grif- fin (1989b), Klingler (1993) Baird (2003, 2004), and Shah (2006). Townsend documented this site during her survey of the Lake Iliamna area in the summers of 1968 and 1969. In 1969, she excavated two large test units (3 m X 5 m and 5 m X 5 m) within the rock shelter directly below the pictographs and collected lithic artifacts, marine shell, and wood charcoal. The assemblage included a pigment sam- ple that was removed from the rock face, though the provenience of the pigment sample is not spe- cifically known (Townsend 1968, 1969). In June 2002, Madonna Moss selected three birch charcoal samples and one marine shell sam- ple for radiocarbon dating; the three birch charcoal samples produced unconnected radiocarbon dates of 1680 ± 40 B.P. (Beta 168515), 1740 ± 40 B.P. (Beta 168516), and 1730 ± 40 B.P. (Beta 168517) and the single cockle shell {Clinocardium nuttallii) produced a radiocarbon age of 970 ± 60 B.P. (Beta 168518, shell). Although the buried archaeological deposits within the rock shelter date to the Late Holocene Pre-contact period (Baird 2003), we can- not definitively associate the pictographs with the human activity that resulted in the subsurface de- posits within the rock shelter. Over 75 pictographs are located on two rock faces of the rock shelter, designated as the south and west walls. The rock shelter walls are sand- stone and the rock face has visible fracture lines; brush and trees grow along the overhang directly above the pictographs. The south wall pictographs are distributed over a 5 m X 4 m area of the rock face and the pictographs on the west wall are dis- tributed over a 6 m X 4.5 m area. The pictographs were also documented by Griffin (1989b), Hender- son (2001), and Shah (2006:28), the latter of whom reported a few additional images not found by ear- lier investigators. There are five types of anthropomorphic body shapes represented at the site: inverted trian- gle torso, thin elongated torso, rounded torso and appendages, abstract, and torsos without limbs. In general, most of the anthropomorphs are bilater- ally symmetrical and shown in frontal view, with one exception. None of the anthropomorphs have facial features. There are nine zoomorphic figures and sea mammals make up the majority of these images. Two figures have body shapes and fin placement that suggest cetaceans, possibly killer whales, and two have body types suggestive of cetaceans or pinnipeds. Like the images at Tuxedni Bay and Sadie Cove, the zoomorphic figures appear to in- dicate motion and could represent sea mammals swimming, leaping, diving, or breaching. There are two images of boats at the site. One image shows a crescent-shaped boat with five pad- dles and five anthropomorphic figures with trian- gular torsos, detached heads, and no appendages. This image could be an umiak, a large boat used by the Alutiiq for long-distance travel and carrying passengers and cargo (Crowell, Steffian, and Pul- lar 2001). The Alutiiq were known to hunt whales in large, open boats and relied on aconite poisons and elaborate rituals to pursue and capture whales (Crowell 1994; Crowell and Laktonen 2001; Heizer 1943). The pictograph sites in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve are located at the confluence of contemporary Dena'ina and Alutiiq territo- ries. The Dena'ina, unlike other inland Athabas- kan hunter-gatherer groups, borrowed and adapted Alutiiq maritime technologies (Kari 1986) and dur- ing the early contact period, were known to use, purchase, and trade for Alutiiq and Aleut kayaks and umiaks (Osgood 1937:67, 70). Based on anal- yses of the pictograph motif styles and type, Baird (2003, 2004) concluded that the images at Tuxedni Bay and 49-SEL-006 were likely affiliated with the Alutiiq or their ancestors prior to the late pre- contact Dena'ina occupation of the area. Compar- ative analyses of images found at both Tuxedni Bay and 49-SEL-006 of whales, sea mammals, and boats are similar to those found on images from decorated items such as hunting hats, kayaks, pad- dles, and masks that are ethnographically known to hold ceremonial and spiritual significance to Alutiiq peoples. Pictographs From Coastal Sites in Prince William Sound Located in the north Gulf of Alaska, Prince Wil- liam Sound includes an intricate system of fiords, bays, inlets, and islands. Regional geological and paleoclimatic research in this region has docu- mented evidence of recurring tectonic and gla-</page><page sequence="5">1 40 Arctic Anthropology 43:2 cial events that have resulted in down-dropping and/or uplift of land in relation to sea level that to- gether have impacted the archaeological record of the region (Mobley et al. 1990; Wiles, Barclay, and Calkin 1999; Yarborough and Yarborough 1998). In the 1930s de Laguna (1956) undertook regional ar- chaeological surveys of coastal sites throughout Prince William Sound and reported pictographs at five sites: Site 9 in Boswell Bay; Sites 12 and 13 near Palugvik; Site 43 on Glacier Island; and Site 59 near Knight Passage. In 2005, a USDA Chugach National Forest (CNF) sponsored team visited all of these sites, except Site 43 on Glacier Island. In this section the pictograph sites reported by de Laguna (1956) and my 2005 investigations of those sites are described. In all cases, the picto- graphs are a brick-red color and the pigment with which they were painted is suspected, but not con- firmed, to be hematite. In general, the current con- dition of the pictographs at all sites reported here is poor. In 1930 de Laguna noted that many of the pictographs were fading and by 2005, many picto- graphs were barely visible. In all cases, vegetation grows in small rock fissures and lichens and moss are present on the rock surfaces. In addition, an unidentified thin, whitish, opaque substance cov- ers some of the pictographs at Sites 12 and 13. Al- though the pictographs were difficult to see, day- light and artificial lighting facilitated viewing. Site 9 Site 9 is a pictograph site located on Hinchinbrook Island, within Chugach National Forest. The site was first recorded by de Laguna (1956) during her 1933 visit, and was further documented by BIA-ANCSA archaeologists, and the Chugach Na- tional Forest (CNF) team (Baird 2006; Merrell 2006). The site is located in an area that was likely a lagoon in the past (L. Yarborough, personal com- munication 2005). The pictographs are distributed over a 5 m X 3 m area of a large rock overhang that is 15 m high and 12 m wide. The rock face walls are sandstone with visible fracture lines and spall- ing. De Laguna illustrated two pictographs: an an- thropomorph or "bear" and an "inverted V, per- haps a highly conventionalized anthropomorphic figure" (de Laguna 1956:102). A closer inspection of the photograph of the "inverted V" pictograph, however, suggests that this image is an anthr opo- morph and that the upper portion of the body has exfoliated or faded. An additional anthropomorph with a triangular torso and outstretched arms was not illustrated or reported by earlier investigators. Site 12 Site 12 is a shell midden and burial site located in a rock shelter on Hawkins Island. This site was first reported by de Laguna (1956), and further documented by BIA-ANCSA archaeologists with contributions from the Cooperative Park Stud- ies Unit (CPSU) (1979) and the CNF team in 2005 (Baird 2006; Merrell 2006). From near shore wa- ters, dense trees and vegetation obscure the site. The rock shelter is located above a steep and erod- ing shell midden approximately 9 m asl. Devil's club [Oplopanax horridus) and wild celery [Hera- cleum lanatum) are abundant and a single spruce tree [Picea sitchensisis) is located in front of the rock shelter. The pictographs are distributed on two rock faces, designated the west and north walls. The rock shelter walls are metamorphic rock with visible fracture lines and spalling surfaces. In 1930, de Laguna (1956:103) excavated three buri- als from below the pictographs and described the pictographs: The pictures . . . are at the back and end of the cave, all 5 or 6 feet above the floor. The elaborate anthropomorphic symbol, reminiscent of North- west Coast style (Fig.22C), is directly above the recess (where the burials were located). At the western end of the cave is a group of paintings representing a human face (Fig. 22A), a jumping whale (Fig. 22B), a horizontal row of circles be- tween 2 parallel lines, and 8 additional paintings which were so blurred that their outlines could not be determined. There is also a large smudge of paint near the eastern end of the rear wall, (de Laguna 1956:103) The image of the "human face" (de Laguna 1956:103, Figure 22A) is painted with two eyes, a large brow connected to the nose, and a detached mouth. This image is strikingly similar to petro- glyphs found at Cape Alitak, a petroglyph site on Kodiak Island (see Knebel 2003; Heizer 1947; Stef- fian 2001:126-127) and to anthropomorphic faces found on Alutiiq "battle-hatchets" described and reproduced by Black (2004:148, Figure 8). It is in- teresting that images similar to the "human face" are not known from Outer Cook Inlet pictograph sites. The "elaborate anthropomorph" pictograph (de Laguna 1956:103, Figure 22C) found above the burials at Site 12 is intriguing. This figure is a con- ventionalized anthropomorphic figure with an ovoid shaped torso depicted without arms or legs. Within the figure's torso are geometric designs: an ovoid "eye" placed vertically; two horizontal lines crossing the top portion of the torso; and four vertical lines painted between the top horizon- tal lines. The figure has a small circular attached head with what appears to be a headdress or hair extending laterally from its crown. The image ap- pears in frontal view. In contrast to other anthro- pomorphic images, this image shows no indication of motion. The ovoid image within the anthropo- morph is evocative of the ovoid form carved and painted by Northwest Coast groups and repre-</page><page sequence="6">Baird: The Study of Pre-Contact Pictographs 141 sented on items such as bentwood boxes, masks, and panels. The zoomorphic figure (de Laguna 1934:104, Figure 22B) is shown in profile and resembles a cetacean or whale. The zoomorph does not have a prominent dorsal fin and looks as if the image could be imperfectly rendered, possibly repre- senting a cetacean, such as a killer whale [Orcinus orca), dolphin [e.g.,ljagenorhynchus, Stenella), pi- lot whale [Globicephala), false killer whale [Pseu- dorca crassidens), or Dall's porpoise [Phocoenoi- des dalli). It could also be a female or juvenile representation of another species. The zoomorphic figure is dynamic and the position of the body is suggestive of motion, possibly breaching. Images of cetaceans are also found at pictographs sites in Outer Cook Inlet, including Tuxedni Bay, 49-KEN- 006, Sadie Cove, and Bear Island. Site 13 Site 13 is an archaeological site located within a mile of Site 12 and was first reported by de Laguna (1956:17) who described: Beyond a stream which flows into a small bight, is an overhanging cliff running obliquely across the beach. This place is called . . . 'Like a Cave/ and was originally a rock shelter, although the land has evidently sunk so that the original floor is now covered by beach gravel and the base of the cliff is washed by the tide, (de Laguna 1956:17) In 1979, BIA-ANCSA archaeologists, with assis- tance from CPSU researchers spent three days sur- veying the site and in 2005, the CNF research team re-located, mapped, and photographed the pic- tographs at the site. There are no burials or shell midden deposits associated with this site. The entrance to the rock shelter is approxi- mately 4 m from the water at high tide. The rock shelter is exposed and the floor is silt, sand, and gravel, assumed to have been deposited by storms and wave action. The pictographs are painted on two rock faces within the shelter, which exhibit numerous fracture lines and spalling surfaces. De Laguna (1956:103) described: The pictures are scattered along a distance of about 15 feet and are at 2 levels. The lower level is from 6 inches to 3 feet above the sloping beach gravel. Proceeding in order from the landward end of this lower group, the pictures are: a headless human fig- ure (Fig. 23E) 6 inches above the gravel; a sea mam- mal (?) (D) above E on a small overhang; a man with clenched fist (B); a human face (A) and a sticklike symbol (G), the last 2 above E, B, and D, and about 3 feet above the gravel; an unidentified symbol (K) 3 feet above the beach; a headless man (C) 2V2 feet above the beach; an umiak with 5 paddlers (?) (F) 6 inches below C; and lastly several smudges near F. The pictures on the upper level are 4 feet above a natural ledge which is itself 8 feet above the beach. . . . These upper pictures are in order: a cross or X (Fig. 231), and oval (J), a boat with 3 men (H), and a smudge, (de Laguna 1956:103) 1 The pictograph of the "human face" (de La- guna 1956:104, Figure 23A) closely resembles the style and form of the face pictograph from Site 12 described earlier, but does not have a mouth. The anthropomorph with the "clenched fist" il- lustrated by de Laguna (1956:104, Figure 23B) dif- fers to some extent from what we observed and recorded in photographs. This figure is of an in- complete anthropomorph with a triangular torso and arms that extend away from the torso. This po- sition is suggestive of movement, possibly pointing or throwing. One other anthropomorph at the site, illus- trated by de Laguna (1956:104: Figure 23E) as the "headless human figure" also looked different in person, at least to this observer. This figure is of an incomplete anthropomorph with no head and a slightly trapezoid torso with arms and legs that extend away from the torso. The figure appears to have a protrusion, possibly a penis, though this is only slightly pronounced. Interestingly, one image at Site 13, de- scribed as an "unidentified symbol" by de Laguna (1956:104, Figure 23K), could be a conventional- ized anthropomorph, similar in style and form to the abstract figure described from Site 12 (Figure 22C). Figure 23K exhibits the same treatment of the torso and is shown without arms or legs. Three converging lines, similar to the shape of a bird's foot, are painted within the figure's torso and di- vide the torso into three triangular spaces. The Site 13 figure probably had a head similar to that of Figure 23K from Site 12. The most visible and prominent pictographs at Site 13, painted high on a ledge, show a group of three anthropomorphs with slender and incom- plete bodies and amorphous heads. These picto- graphs were not reported by de Laguna (1956) and could indicate that the images were painted later, at a time subsequent to her 1930 visit. If the picto- graphs were painted by post-1930s visitors to the site, then they would testify to the enduring cul- tural value of this place. The anthropomorphs' body styles are noticeably different from the other anthropomorphs found at the site. The prominent placement of these images is clearly meaningful and it is possible that the images may have func- tioned as a territorial marker or to announce a spe- cific group's right to the site. There are also two boats represented at Site 13 and both were illustrated by de Laguna (1956:104, Figures 23F and 23H). Figure 23F is a semi-lunar shaped boat, possibly an umiak with five anthropomorphs. Figure 23H is a large crescent-shaped boat, possibly a kayak, with three occupants.</page><page sequence="7">1 42 Arctic Anthropology 43:2 Site 59 Site 59 is a burial and pictograph site located on an island in the Knight Island Passage. In 1902, Meany (1906) reportedly removed seven mum- mies from the rock shelter (de Laguna 1956:30). De Laguna (1956) documented the site in 1930 and 1933. Site 59 was further documented by BIA- ANCSA archaeologists in 1980 and the CNF team in 2005. From nearshore waters, dense trees and vegetation obscure the rock shelter. De Laguna (1956:31) described the site: The floor is about 15 feet above the water, and an open cave is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. Seven mummies are said to have been found here, sit- ting with their backs against the cliff. Nothing remained in 1930 but some adze planks and scat- tered bones. We revisited the site in 1933 and discovered some pictures painted in red on the overhang rock, 5 feet or more above the floor of the shelter [PL 7, 1; Fig. 24]. (de Laguna 1956:31) The rock shelter is approximately 5 m X 10 m and is located on a terrace at approximately 12 m asl. The rock shelter walls are reportedly gra- nitic and the pictographs are painted within the rock shelter, directly above where the human re- mains were reported, and on an exposed rock face that is visible from the shoreline. The location of the pictographs was described by de Laguna (1956:103): The pictures . . . are on the back wall of the rock shelter, some 5 feet above the floor. The wall has weathered badly that several paintings could not be traced [PL 7, 1], These pictures represented a seal [?] [Fig. 24 A], a cross [B], and 2 boats with paddlers, one of which was copied [C]; the re- maining pictures could not be deciphered, (de Laguna 1956:103) Figure 24A, described above, is a symmetri- cal zoomorphic figure shown in plan view with an oblong body and flippers, possibly a pinniped. To- day, the image is barely discernable. Two images of boats were found approximately 8 m from the rock shelter and high on the exposed rock face. De Laguna (1956:105, Figure 24C) illustrated one boat and suspected that it represented an umiak with seven or eight occupants. The second boat is placed slightly higher than 24C and is similar in style and form. The significance of the placement of these images away from the rock shelter and high on the rock face is not clear. The final section of the paper consists of a comparison of the pictographs assemblages illus- trated by de Laguna in 1934 from outer Cook Inlet with those she illustrated in 1956 from Prince Wil- liam Sound. The commonalities and differences in style will be examined in order to discuss the eth- nic affiliation of the pictograph creators and the roles of the sites in past Native Alaskan cultures. Analysis: The Pre-Contact Pictographs from Coastal Sites in Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound "If you really want to see something, look at something else." (Howard Nemerov [n.d.], poet and author) In this section, the pictograph sites are compared to examine if similarities and differences among them can be related to site functions, ethnic affilia- tion of the artists, or relationships between groups. Ethnographic and archaeological works that might shed some light on the identity or function of the images are discussed as well. This section asks: Do the pictographs of Prince William Sound "find their closest analogy in the Eskimo pictographs of Cook Inlet" (de Laguna 1956:109)? Could differ- ences and similarities among and between the pic- tographic imagery from these regions indicate that relationships and cultural area boundaries were more fluid than originally observed (Moss 1992)? In all cases the pictographs were painted with a red pigment. According to ethnography and archaeology, ochre is known to have been used throughout the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Ar- chipelago. Ochre-stained floors have been found by archaeologists (Fitzhugh 2003) and early Alu- tiiq archaeological sites frequently contain the re- mains of house structures with ochre stained floors (Steffian 2001:108). De Laguna (1956:251) exca- vated ochre samples at the Palugvik 1, Palugvik 2, Palugvik 4, and Palugvik East Point archaeologi- cal sites located within a mile of Sites 12 and 13 in Prince William Sound. Ethnographical infor- mation shows that the Alutiiq used paint in a va- riety of ceremonies, including feasts, hunting cer- emonies, and funerals. Birket-Smith (1953:34) reported that the Alutiiq painted animals on rocks in secret places as part of whaling ceremonies. Os- good (1937) noted that the Dena'ina used red pig- ment, apparently red ochre. Because the Alutiiq, Chugach, and Dena'ina commonly used red ochre and it is widely available, it is not a strong indica- tor of ethnic identity. Accounting for the diversity of pictographs within and between the sites and regions is intrigu- ing. In general, iconographic imagery, design el- ements, and carving styles found throughout the region adhere to an established set of stylistic con- ventions (see for example Black 1987; Desson 1995). What then, might be significant about the differences? It is possible that some of the differ- ences result from the texture of the rock and char- acter of the rock surface itself. However, while such differences might affect the application of pigment, they should not necessarily affect the iconographic</page><page sequence="8">Baird: The Study of Pre-Contact Pictographs 1 43 content of the pictograph assemblages. Is it possi- ble that different artists or cultural groups painted the images over a period of time? The anthropomorphs between the outer Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound are highly var- ied. For example, the conventionalized anthropo- morphic figures with ovoid-shaped torsos depicted without arms or legs found at Sites 12 and 13 in Prince William Sound are unlike any pictographs found in the outer Cook Inlet region. Further, the "human face" pictographs also found at these sites include facial features - eyes, brows, nose, and mouths that are similar to the features depicted on Alutiiq masks (see de Laguna 1956:103-104, Fig- ures 23A and 22A). As described earlier, the an- thropomorphs from the outer Cook Inlet region lack any recognizable facial features. The difference in human figure types rep- resented in the two regions could reflect the de- cisions made by the artists to depict anthropo- morphs in different ways, perhaps indicating social difference or status. According to ethno- graphic studies, Alutiiq societies were ranked and delineated by wealth and familial lineages, and so- cial status was reflected (and exhibited) through a person's clothing, personal adornment, hairstyles, and tattoos (Crowell and Liihrmann 2001:43). Vari- ation in iconographic motifs could also be related to the expression of an individual artist or simply reflect regional styles. There are noticeable iconographic similari- ties among the pictograph assemblages from outer Cook Inlet that are not represented in the Prince William Sound pictograph assemblages. For exam- ple, at Sadie Cove, Bear Island, Tuxedni Bay, and 49-SEL-006 the majority of zoomorphic images de- pict sea mammals, whereas in the Prince William Sound pictograph sites, images of sea mammals are infrequent. These animals were extremely im- portant to maritime people and provided subsis- tence foods, raw materials for making boats and clothing, and oil for lamps. It is unfortunate that the Prince William Sound pictographs do not pro- vide enough detail to allow more precise identifi- cations of the species represented. Relationships between humans and ani- mals were central to many cultures of the Gulf and Alaska Peninsula regions. The Yup'ik had a col- laborative relationship with animals and believed that "all humans and animals . . . shared person- hood" (Fienup-Riordan 1994:48). Bodenhorn (1990:62), in a discussion of Iñupiat hunting rit- uals, described how the Iñupiat believed that tak- ing an animal's life involved treating the soul, or inuaf correctly and how they had developed com- plex rituals that mediated how people hunted. The Alutiiq also believed that each animal possessed a soul, or sugunha (Crowell and Laktonen 2001:142). Often, animals and people shared features and people could transform into animal spirit forms (Crowell and Leer 2001:194). Therefore, images of animals could represent the relationship between the human and animal or human and spirit worlds (see for example, Crowell and Laktonen 2001; Fienup-Riordan 1994, 1996:38-41). Pictographs illustrated from both the outer Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound regions in- clude images of boats. Two pictographs in the 49- SEL-006 collection feature crescent-shaped boats, possibly umiaks, with five anthropomorphic fig- ures. The Tuxedni Bay site also has two large crescent-shaped boats, possibly umiaks with an- thropomorphs that are stylistically much different from those at 49-SEL-006. The boats depicted at Tuxedni Bay are smaller than the boats at Site 49- SEL-006, do not have paddles, and the human figures within the boats are not well defined. In- terestingly, only Tuxedni Bay has images of the small, crescent-shaped kayaks. Boats are repre- sented at Site 13 and Site 59 in Prince William Sound as well. While the representations of boats are inter- esting, so is evidence of how various groups used them, for this provides a basis for understanding potential relationships among groups geographi- cally distant from one another. The Alutiiq used skin-covered kayaks and umiaks to hunt, fish, and travel. According to Varjola et al. (1990:206) and Zimmerly (2000), boat shapes and types were iden- tifiable by region. These seaworthy and fast boats were expertly crafted and flexible to prevent break- ing or splitting in the rough seas and could range over great distances for hunting, trading, and visit- ing (Rousselot 1994; Varjola et al. 1990; Zimmerly 2000). The Alutiiq are known to have decorated their kayaks with zoomorphic figures, hunting scenes, and attached amulets that ensured safety and success in hunting (Rousselot et al. 1994). Kayaks are depicted only at one site in outer Cook Inlet: Tuxedni Bay. This could indicate that this site was used by Kodiak Alutiiq groups eth- nographically known to hunt whales in kayaks rather than the larger umiaks. Fitzhugh (2003:27) reported: Whale hunting on Kodiak, unlike better known traditions in northern Alaska, was accomplished by several independent hunters or pairs of hunters in kayaks who attempted to spear a whale under a flipper or fluke with a poison-tipped lance . . . With luck, the dead whale would float to the sur- face within a few days and drift ashore near the hunters' village. (Fitzhugh 2003:27) This cooperative hunting strategy was also used in hunting sea otters in the Alutiiq region (Crow- ell 1994). Differences in boat designs could be related to different needs of the hunters and/or the avail-</page><page sequence="9">1 44 Arctic Anthropology 43:2 ability of resources. The larger boats depicted at 49-SEL-006, Site 13 and Site 59 could represent communal hunting parties, whereas the sin- gle kayak image at Tuxedni Bay could indicate solo hunting of sea mammal or whales. Crowell and Laktonen (2001:152) reported that the Alutiiq used large boats, 6 to 10 meters long for long- distance travel, warfare, and towing whales. The boats were sometimes overturned and used as shel- ter. Remains of these large boats have been exca- vated at the Karluk One archaeological site (Crow- ell and Laktonen 2001:152). Boats were also used in warfare or raiding. Archaeological and ethnographic evidence indi- cates that warfare and trade were integral to Alu- tiiq societies before contact (Fitzhugh 2003:83). The Alutiiq had hostile relations with Dena'ina and other groups (Osgood 1937) and acquired slaves through raids or by trade (Crowell and Lühr- mann 2001:43). Before Russian contact, the Alu- tiiq used these large boats in trade expeditions, raids, and warfare throughout the Kodiak Archi- pelago and the coastal regions of outer Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound (Crowell and Laktonen 2001:153). Perhaps the most striking difference between the outer Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound re- gions is found by looking at the contents of the ar- chaeology sites that include pictographs. The ma- jority of pictograph sites from Prince William Sound contain human burials. Whether the pic- tographs are contemporaneous with the burials would require further investigation. No burials, however, are reported from pictograph sites along outer Cook Inlet. The different site types could in- dicate different site functions or different cultural practices. This topic would require a more de- tailed investigation. The images from the outer Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound regions might have been created and used for a variety of site-specific so- cial interactions or ceremonial activities, includ- ing whale or sea mammal hunting ceremonies, burial ceremonies, performances to honor or pla- cate spirits, or feasts. Ethnographically and archae- ologically, the Yup'ik, Alutiiq, and Chugach had complex social and spiritual traditions that in- volved relationships with the natural and spiritual worlds. These relationships were reflected in their traditional art and objects. The images may have been mnemonic or pedagogical devices, possi- bly related to rituals, cosmologies, and beliefs, and might have been used in sea mammal hunting cer- emonies and/or shamanic trances. The similarities and variations among and between the corpus of pictographic imagery and the contents of the archaeological sites from the Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound regions sug- gest that cultural area boundaries were fluid and shifted over time. It is possible that the images were made by one group with different artists vis- iting the sites over an extended period of time. Al- ternatively, it is important to consider that stylis- tic differences might reflect that multiple ethnic groups were visiting these sites and painting the images. If this were the case, one would expect in- stances where there would be similarities of styles between regions. For example, pictographs from Site 13 in Prince William Sound show similarities to archaeological and ethnographic materials from both the Kodiak Archipelago and outer Cook Inlet regions, and images of umiaks from Site 59 are re- markably similar to those found in Tuxedni Bay. Possibly the variation found in the pictograph as- semblages between the two regions represents dif- ferent ethnic or social boundaries than those doc- umented ethnographically. Steffian (2001:124) argued that petroglyphs and pictographs could have been territorial markers that signified own- ership. Fitzhugh (2003:82-83) reported "vigor- ous inter-coastal trade networks" and expeditions between Kodiak groups and those on the "main- land." If this is the case, then perhaps the variation in images between regions represent some form of social interaction or negotiation. Conclusion De Laguna's hypothesis that the pictographs from Prince William Sound are stylistically similar to the pictographs of Cook Inlet is well supported. At Site 59, images of crescent-shaped boats are analo- gous to images found at Tuxedni Bay and 49-SEL- 006 and provide evidence of a shared style be- tween these two regions. At Site 12 and Site 13, images of sea mammals and anthropomorphs are evocative of images found at Tuxedni Bay, Bear Is- land, Sadie Cove, and 49-SEL-006. We know from the combination of sea mammals and boats found from both regions that people interested in mari- time activities visited the sites. However, a comparison of the complete pic- tograph assemblages between the regions reveals some marked differences. For example, pictograph images from Site 12 and Site 13 include human faces and conventionalized anthropomorphic fig- ures that are significantly different in style and form from the pictographs of outer Cook Inlet and more closely resemble images found from Kodiak contexts. Further, the conventionalized anthro- pomorph pictograph (de Laguna 1956:103, Figure 22C) painted directly above the reported burials at Site 12, is unlike any of the reported pictographs from outer Cook Inlet. As described, a similar ab- stract anthropomorph was also discovered at Site 13 and hints at a relationship between these sites and possibly extending far beyond the shores of Prince William Sound.</page><page sequence="10">Baird: The Study of Pre-Contact Pictographs 1 45 The similarities and differences between the pictograph assemblages and site types between the outer Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound re- gions emphasize the diversity and complexity of cultures moving in and around these regions in the past. They also highlight the need to include the pictographic material in investigations of these re- gions. In considering the origin, continuity, and diversity of cultural groups that inhabited the central Gulf of Alaska region, large gaps in the eth- nographic, ethnohistorical, and archaeological re- cords remain. Culture areas may not necessarily reflect the social boundaries, patterns of interre- gional interaction, or the extent of interaction be- tween cultural groups and across cultural bound- aries (Moss 1992:6). Pictograph sites throughout the central Gulf of Alaska provide a unique opportunity to ex- plore questions about the nature of past human occupation of the region and the significance of these sites within the larger archaeological, ethno- graphic, and regional context. Frederica de Lagu- na's study of pre-contact pictographs from coastal sites throughout Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound investigated the identity and extent of hu- man occupations and interactions in these regions and provided a model for subsequent researchers. Based on the poor condition of these sites today, in which the pictographs are barely visible, we are indebted to her for the careful study and detailed illustration of the pictograph assemblages.
