Conse- quently our collections of South American antiquities -are very largely formed from private collections, purchased here and there, and without good documentation. Despite these difficulties the British Museum has built up a fine collection of Peruvian pottery, which includes the well- known Vandenbergh collection of Mochica vessels from the Chicama Valley. But until very recently, as far as I am aware, the Cupisnique (or Coastal Chavin) culture was not represented in any museum collection in the British Isles, and the rigorous Peruvian Anrtiquities Laws make it unlikely that anv large quantity from this culture will ever be available for exhibition in this country. There is there- fore some justification for recording a brief description of three vases of undoubtedly Cupisnique type which have been acquired in the last few years by the British Museum. All three vases are of a massive construction witlh heavy stirrup spouts and a slip which varies from dark grey, or purplish browni, to black. Perhaps the most interesting is one (Plate Hb, d, e) in which the shape of the bodv of the pot can best be de- scribed as resembling a cow bell. This is unornamnented *With Plate H and a text figure II3</page><page sequence="3">No. J59 Man AUGUST, 1952 save bv a feline animal seated on a throne and by five panels terminating in scrolls all in high relief. These latter are suggestive of the decoration on Ulua Valley vases in Honduras. They are arranged as follows: one thinner large panel on each side with the terminal scroll towards the rear of the vase, and joined by a flat basal section headed by a scroll curving forwards. On the back is a large panel with a scroll termination facing the left. There are indica- tions of pre- and post-firing incision used to embellish the relief work. Unlike most feline representations on Cupisnique potterv, this animal shows no anthropomorphic features, yet we can identify him clearly with the anthropomorphic feline deity of the Cupisnique peoples, and indeed of Chavin, by the throne on which he is seated. The scroll-like forms are apparently associated in one composition with the feline deitv, since the tail (which has been damaged) spreads over onto one of the scroll panels. This fact, togetlher with the general arrangement, encourages us to suggest that these panels may represent, very conven- tionally, the sides and back of the throne, the seat of which is represented conventionally by a rectangular slab in front. The stirrup spout, while narrower than on many Cupisnique vases, is still massive, and the arch is flattened on top to give a trapezoid effect. The actual spout is missing but presumably terminated in a flanged top rather like a chimney pot. The second vase, the only complete specimen (Plate Ha), is a typical stirrup vase with an almost hemispherical body. The stirrup spout is of large diameter, and forms an almost continuous arc of a circle. It is surmounted by a heavy spout of 'chimney-pot' type with a flanged rim. Except for the base, the inner surface of the stirrup, and the spout, the whole vase is ornamented by evenly spaced protuber- ances and incised 'hatching,' the whole appearance re- sembling the outer surface of a fir cone. The third vase (Plate Hc) resembles the second in general type, though the body of the pot is taller in relation to its base, and the ornament is more flamboyant and less care- fully executed. The body decoration is basically the same, except that the protuberances are more irregular, and the 'hatching' is replaced by a great many rather deep punctate impressions. The over-all surface effect is broken up by five petaloid panels in relief, which are left plain. The outer surface of the stirrup spout is shielded by a number of bosses in high relief, and the intervening space between the bosses is covered with light punctate marks which resemble comb markings. An examination of the spouts of all three vases raises some interesting problems. In each case there is evidence that the actual mouth, or neck, was made separately, and butted onto a hole in the arch of the stirrup, but X-ray photographs show no sign of any transverse join anywhere in the walls of the stirrup, and there is no sign anywhere that the stirrup was made in two halves andjoined together sagittally, which would be an easy way to make a stirrup spout, and one which is in fact adopted in some Mochica vases of apparently late date and in many Chimu-style vases. In the second and third pots the spouts are of so large a diameter, and on such a convenient curve, that the inside could possibly be modelled and smoothed by inserting the fingers through the two ends and the middle aperture for the mouth, but this method would be impossible in the case of the first. Before an X-ray photograph was taken of the arch of the first pot it was expected that the form of construction would prove analogous to that found in the vases with a triangular-shaped stirrup arch, generally associated with the Mochica IV or V periods, in which two straight tubular pieces project outward from the body of the pot, and are joined by a third tubular piece which forms a bridge. In vases of this period the outside is smoothed to give an un- broken curve, but the inside shows the loose ends from manufacture quite clearly. In- fact, however, an X-ray photograph of the spout of our first pot (fig. i) shows no FIG. I. X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH OF 'STIRRUP' VASE (PLATE Hb) Photograph by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum sign of a join. It seems most improbable that the spout was modelled on a straight stick which was then withdrawn to allow the ends to be bent over, for there would almost certainly have been a flattening or even a collapse of the tube. We must therefore look for some alternative method of manufacture. It would of course be possible to start with the centre of the spout, and build up outwards, smoothing inside and out with the fingers as the stirrup advanced, but the process would be a difficult one. The alternative would be to make a core of wax or some other fusible substance around which the spout could be built up in exacdy the same way as a mould for a cire perdue casting is made; the wax would then be dispersed when the pot was fired. There are arguments which could be put forward to support either view. The generally larger diameter of the Cupisnique spouts would permit of modelling on the lines suggested, and this method fits in very well with the general technological sequence for Peruviain stirrup-spout vessels. The following table based on this assumption shows a pro- gressive simplification: Cupisnique Stirrup hand-modelled in one piece except mouth. Salinar No evidence available.

Mochica Four with very long horns giving a triangular stirrup. rMoulded in two pieces sagittally and then attached Chimu to the vase. Moulded integrally in two halves with the whole Lvase. In favour of the cire perdiie hypothesis it can be said that from a very early time in Peru moulds were used for pottery-making, and that small metal objects of Mochica style were probably cast by cire perdue, although no evidence has been found of such metal work in the Cupisnique phase. A lost-wax process was applied to pottery-manufacture as early as the Gallinazo culture to produce the effect known as negative painting, but this was 400 years or more later than the Cupisnique. On technical grounds therefore there seems to be good reason for believing that it could be easy to conceive of cire perdue moulds and cores in pottery- making in CupLismque times. On the other hand, if cores of wax or some other fusible substance were used, it is surprising that the application of wax to-negative painting lagged so far behind. It would also imply an anticipation of the application of the cire perdue process to metal-working. Finally-and this is perhaps the most telling argument-if spouts were made on wax cores by the Cupisnique people, it would be reasonable to expect the Mochica to use the same tech- nique, which would be admirably suited to the narrower spouts they used. Since there is no evidence that this was ever done, the balance of probability lies with the hand- modelling process.</page></plain_text>
