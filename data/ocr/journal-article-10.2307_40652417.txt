BEQUEST OF RICHARD S. ZEISLER, 2007.279 IN RESPONSE TO the chaotic social and political climate following World War I, painter Amédée Ozenfant and architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret - better known by the pseudonym Le Corbusier - called for a change in the direction of contemporary French art. Criticizing Cubism as too ornamental, they argued that "the only Art to survive its era is the art truly rooted in its time" and therefore sought to promote a new, modern classicism.1 Calling this style Purism, Ozenfant, Le Corbusier, and their colleague Fernand Léger embraced industry and technology, and favored geometrical forms, logic, mathematical order, and purity over artistic methodologies that they perceived as "accidental, exceptional, impressionistic, inorganic, contestatory, [and] picturesque."2 Though Le Corbusier is now best known for his architectural achievements, his effort to develop and promote Purist aesthetics occupied him intensely between 191 8 and 1 92 5 .3 His Still Life Filled with Space exemplifies the paintings he and Ozenfant executed during this period, exploring the formal visual relationships of mass-produced objects such as bottles, carafes, coffeepots, glasses, and pipes with architectural precision.4 Striving to achieve the geometrical order that the artists endorsed in their periodical L'Esprit nouveau, Le Corbusier arranged this still life around the axes of a nearly perfect Cartesian grid, using carefully juxtaposed planes of color, as opposed to the rules of linear perspective, to indicate volume and depth. 68 In order to eliminate the hand of the artist from their work, the Purists generally painted in a smooth style, obscuring their brushstrokes. In Still Life Filled with Space, however, Le Corbusier added an unusual amount of decorative texture, particularly in the patterned border that he created by dragging "a comblike tool repeatedly through the wet white paint. Moreover, while the human figure had largely disappeared from Le Corbusier's and Ozenfant 's work by 1 92 1, in this canvas, incidental anthropomorphic forms emerge from the placement of overlapping and seemingly transparent objects.5 Le Corbusier's deviations from the standard Purist approach are unexpected, considering that he executed the picture just one year before he presented the Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau - his "grand summation of Purist aesthetics" - at the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris.6 While these modifications may embody the integration of humanity and technology that the Purists envisioned, they also foreshadow Le Corbusier's break with Ozenfant, the end of Purism as a cohesive intellectual movement, and the artist's reintroduction of the human figure in his paintings of the later 1920s.

Since Cahun's work was rediscovered in the 1980s, it has been the subject of much scholarship, including François Leperlier, Claude Cahun, l'écart et la métamorphose (Jean- Michel Place, 1992); Louise Downie, ed., Don't Kiss Me: The Art of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore (Tate Publishing/ Jersey Heritage Trust, 2006); and Gen Doy, Claude Cahun: A Sensual Politics of Photography (I. B. Tauris, 2007). 2. Cahun's theatrical self-portraits have often been heralded as precursors to the work of recent photographers including Nan Goldin and Cindy Sherman. Cahun also experimented with other artistic media, often in collaboration with her lifelong partner Suzanne Malherbe (known as Marcel Moore). Born in Nantes, Cahun settled in Paris with Moore in the early 1920s. In 1938 they relocated to the island of Jersey, where, after the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of German troops, they engaged in- and were arrested for- anti-war activities. 3. The 1936 exhibition catalogue lists only two objects by Cahun: Un air de famille and Souris valseuses. Descriptions of these works can be found in Doy (note 1), p. 124. The third untitled and uncatalogued piece- the one that is the subject of this entry- is visible in an installation photograph of the 1936 exhibition and was first identified as Cahun's in the 1986 Zabriskie Gallery exhibition catalogue, 1936 Surrealism. See Steven Harris, Surrealist Art and Thought in the 1930s: Art, Politics, and Psyche (Cambridge University Press, 2004), pp. 163, 281 n. 44. 4. Some of the hair is human; the rest is either artificial or from an animal. 5. As detailed in Harris (note 3) pp. 168-73, this phrase unites two unrelated sources- the first a well-known slogan from France's left-wing Popular Front, and the second a line printed on Belgian currency. With this conflated text, Cahun referenced contemporary politics and pointed an accusatory finger at the supposed revolutionary leaders of France. 6. A bilboquet is a toy with a ball on a string attached to a cup or spike. Cahun's Object probably also references Georges Bataille's novel Histoire de l'Oeil (1928), which details the sexual exploits and perversions of two young lovers. Harris (note 3), among others, has identified these various iconographical sources. For a psychoanalytical reading of Cahun's Object, see Harris (note 3), pp. 163-73- 7. Claude Cahun, "Prenez garde aux objets domestiques," Cahiers d'Art 11 (1936), p. 46. This essay was included in a special issue of Cahiers d'Art that coincided with the 1936 Surrealist Exposition of Objects. For this English translation and a discussion of the essay, see Harris (note 3), pp. 160-63, 178-80. Cahun's article is interrupted by a full-page photograph (attributed to Willy Eggarter) of a disembodied hand holding a large egg from the ostrich-like epiornis; see Cahun (above), p. 47. The formal similarities between the subject matter of Cahun's Object and of this photograph of a scientific specimen- one of the "natural objects" included in the 1936 exhibition- are noteworthy. 8. 1 would like to thank Art Institute curator Stephanie D'Alessandro for sharing her research on this piece, and for providing guidance during the writing of this entry.</page></plain_text>
