Wien, Serie A 120 19–30 Wien, 15 Jan. 2018 “Forever young”: neoteny and design László Bartosiewicz1 (with 6 figures) Manuscript submitted on July 19th 2017,  the revised manuscript on November 3rd 2017. Abstract The evolutionary relevance of neoteny, the concept that adults displaying youthful proportions  evoke caregiving instincts, has frequently been questioned. The biological roots of the prob- lem lead to the expression of age, sex and inheritance in size and shape. Formalist interpreta- tions, however, can be misleading as the idea itself is anthropocentric. This weakness (in natural  science) makes historic reflections on neoteny more interesting in material culture shaped by  humans themselves. Archaeozoological examples include animal breeds, especially dogs. The  attraction to “youthful” proportions also seems to have been exploited in both the creative and  applied arts. Researchers of this eminently interdisciplinary subject cannot ignore overarching  questions regarding complex and mutual interactions between nature and culture. Keywords: ontogeny, craniology, allometry, archaeozoology, neoteny, animal breeding. Introduction Since the onset of domestication, animals have, more-or-less, been consciously shaped by  humans through breeding regimes in captivity. In archaeology, human interference with  reproduction distinguishes domesticates as true “artefacts” from their wild ancestors.  Bones of hunted game may be considered undisturbed “ecofacts” characteristic of ancient  natural habitats. In hunter-gatherer societies the human manipulation of wild animals  is limited to signs of peri- and post mortem handling. (It is only in the last century that  wildlife management began measurably influencing the morphology of red deer antlers  in Europe, mirroring the ideal design laid out in the trophy scoring system of the Conseil  International de la Chasse [CIC] established in 1930; Bartosiewicz 1999: p. 87). Human impact on variability in domesticates was comprehensively illustrated by Charles  Darwin (1868). Domestic breeds “are human creations just like ancient buildings and  are living creatures just like the giant panda” (BoDó 2001: p. 3). This duality means that  1 Osteoarchaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University, Lilla Frescativägen 7, 114 18 Stock- holm, Sweden; e-mail: laszlo.bartosiewicz@ofl.su.se </page> <page sequence="2"> 20 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 domesticates are diagnostic of culture, but are not static: they dynamically evolve along  with societal constraints and needs. Traditional archaeozoology in Central Europe was concerned with the origins of breeds.  Rigid typological classifications (including those of skulls) represented an important  method in these efforts in the 19th and early 20th century. Interpretations, however, often  became spurious. “The concept of race was equally applied to domestic breeds... as  well as to subspecies of wild animals and human populations. This undifferentiated con- ceptual formation always gave rise to inadequate generalizations and growing errors”  (Pucher 2013: p. 54). Human craniological studies have not withstood the historical test  of times: Rassenkunde became the best example illustrating the tragic consequences of  short-sighted formalism. This paper is a brief study of relationships between shape, perception and design with  regard to the role of neoteny in the context of human communication. Material and Methods The shape of an animal is a basic component in its appearance. However, shape changes  continuously through ontogeny; if static shape influences our perception of an organism,  so does its dynamic change through an individual’s development. By the 20th century,  increasing efforts were made by scientists such as D’Arcy Wentworth thomPson (1917),  Julian S. huxley (1924, 1932), and Samuel BroDy (1945) to develop and apply quanti- tative models reliably defining relationships between organismic size and shape. Trained  in animal science, my early work was greatly inspired by their classical ideas (Barto- siewicz 1980). Concepts outlined here will be illustrated using animal skulls photographed by the author  in the reference collection of the Osteoarchaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm  University. They include the skulls of a present-day wolf (Canis lupus linnaeus, 1758: p.  39), two modern dogs (Canis familiaris linnaeus, 1758: p. 38) and a domestic cat (Felis  catus linnaeus, 1758: p. 42). The skull of the cave lion (Panthera leo spelaeus GolDfuss,  1810: p. 27), recovered near Ikrény in western Hungary, was photographed by Erika Gál. Wild species and their domestic derivatives were given separate names in traditional  Linnaean nomenclature. The Latin terminology used here follows recommendations by  Anthea Gentry et al. (2004: p. 647). Palatal measurements shown in Figure 5 were  defined by Angela von Den Driesch (1976: pp. 42–45). Results A key concept relevant to this treatise is allometry, variability in shape as a function  of size. Its manifestation is evident during an individual’s growth and development  (intraspecific allometry) and may also be observed between related species of different  sizes (interspecific allometry). </page> <page sequence="3"> Bartosiewicz: Neoteny and design 21 Fig. 1.

Felids  display considerable interspecific size differences (GuGGisBerG 1975), offering exam- ples of how cranial proportions differ between fully grown specimens of small and large  species. The most notable feature in both examples is the great proportion and round  shape of the brain case in smaller animals. Individuals of large absolute size, on the other  hand, have more strongly developed snouts. In Figure 2, the skulls of the same puppy and mature cat are shown alongside that of  a pug (centre). Ancestors of this dog breed were imported from China in the 16th cen- tury to be first popularized among royalty, such as the House of Orange and the House  of Stuart (farr &amp; montaGue 1999). Representing a case of inherited brachycephalia  promoted through breeding, skulls of adult pugs have a relatively “youthful” look: large  neurocranium and extremely short snout (brachygnathia). This is an extreme case of  neoteny, the retention of features from early ontogeny into older ages relative to ances- tors or to fellow members in the same population (Jones et al. 1995: p. 728). According  to Konrad lorenz (1943) features of the Kindchenschema, the baby-like looks of juve- nile creatures, motivate caregiving emotions through the “cute” appearance cultivated  in neotenic breeds. It has been a contentious issue whether affectionate response to such features is inherited  (as lorenz hypothesized) or whether it is acquired behavior built upon an evolution- ary predisposition for associating affection to learned key stimuli. A recent experiment  involving 122 humans has indicated that responding to neotenic looks is a critical func- tion of social cognition. It may play a key role in caregiving and have implications for  infant-caretaker interactions (Glocker et al. 2009: p. 61). While the primary percep- tion of the Kindchenschema looks similar in men and women, the resulting stronger  </page> <page sequence="5"> Bartosiewicz: Neoteny and design 23 caregiving motivation in women could have evolutionary advantages, as females act as  primary caregivers in most cultures (eiBl-eiBesfelDt 1989). In many mammalian species secondary sexual dimorphism is apparent in size, with  males usually growing larger. Size thus contributes to the manifestation of sexual char- acter in body proportions. The complex issue of human neoteny contributing to female  facial attractiveness cannot be addressed here. Studies indicate however that, among  other things, female models in the United States display neotenic facial proportions in  comparison with a sample of “ordinary” undergraduates (Jones et al. 1995: p. 733).  Agencies preferring such models, however, may be more driven by the objectification of  women – “designing” an ideal – than by sexual selection in an evolutionary sense. Engendered companion animals? The cat skull in Figure 2 leads to another gender aspect of neoteny as cats have tra- ditionally been looked upon as incarnations of stereotypical “female” characteristics.  Although powerful men such as the Prophet Mohammed, General Wallenstein and  Admiral Nelson are known to have liked cats (zimmermann &amp; zimmermann 1944),  heteronormative thinking frequently associates feminine manners and even male homo- sexuality with this companion animal (foGle 1981). Earl X. freeD (1965: p. 4) ana- lyzed responses by 3,863 children (aged 8–17 years), to self-administered projective  questions about which animals they would identify with. While the percent of boys  and girls naming dog as their favorite were the same, more than twice as many girls as  boys preferred cats. Since the survey concerned dogs in general (i. e., neoteny was not  considered), one may presume that the neotenic look of cats played some role in making  them more popular among girls, traditionally more conditioned for caregiving roles than  boys in many cultures. In addition to being reminiscent of babies in size and shape, another shared trait of cats  and neotenic dogs is that – regardless of their ages – both possess anthropomorphic  facial structures, especially forward-oriented eyes. (The dark side of this cranial feature  is the widely cited historic relation between cats, owls and witches; Bartosiewicz 1998;  nickel 2009). Although the association between gender and cranial morphology is impossible to  directly demonstrate using osteological evidence alone, neotenic dogs tend to play a role  in female iconography, for example on two mid-14th century Gothic sarcophagi in the  chapel devoted to São Cosme and São Damião in the Lisbon cathedral (Bartosiewicz  2011: p. 223, fig. 17.3). Two pug-like dwarf dogs shown at the feet of a young woman  of high social status are of particular interest here (Figure 3). They pre-date colonial  contacts between Portugal and China by at least two centuries. Although the similarity  between these statues and Early Modern Age pugs may be coincidental, the occurrence  of such dogs on a tombstone dedicated to a young female seems to mirror gender-related  preferences. </page> <page sequence="6"> 24 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 Fig. 3.

Neotenic dogs in Hungarian Antiquity Brachycephalic dog skulls occur in the archaeozoological record in Hungary. A previ- ously unpublished calvarium of a dwarf dog from the Roman provincial town of Savaria  is shown in Figure 4. The precise provenance of this find within the complex urban  stratigraphy remains unknown. However, it fits well within the broad morphological  diversity of dogs seen at Roman provincial sites (Bökönyi 1984; Peters 1997: p. 515,  fig. 1) in comparison with surrounding territories of the Barbaricum where size extremes  were missing (Bartosiewicz 2000). This curious form is consonant with the idea of conscious Roman animal breeding as  well as the popularity of small companion dogs at the time. Such pets could be used for  little beyond self-representation in high society and possibly satisfying an emotional  need for caregiving. Even if neotenic features of the skull from Savaria are not as extreme as those of the  present-day pug shown in Figure 2, it displays symptoms of inherited brachygnathia  resulting from the arrested development of the facial region. Domestication usually  meant a preference for quiet individuals with low metabolic rates, inadvertently perpet- uating inherited thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism). This condition may be a  </page> <page sequence="7"> Bartosiewicz: Neoteny and design 25 Fig. 4. Skull of a small dog from Roman Period Savaria, Hungary. Lateral, frontal, and basilar  aspects.

Aside  from clinically grave cases, this genetic anomaly in domesticates has been cultivated by  hobby breeders. Palatal measurements in Figure 5 indicate that Roman dogs from the city of Gorsium  in Hungary (Bökönyi 1984: pp. 204–205) had more elongated snouts than wolves, as  shown by the cluster of data points falling below the trend line drafted on the basis of  present-day wolves. Greyhounds illustrate increasing diversity in facial variability. The  pug and the small Savaria specimen fall above the regression line, rivalled by only a  slightly larger brachygnathic dog skull from Gorsium. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, dwarf dogs seem to have disappeared  from the archaeological record in Europe. The remains of neotenic forms resurfaced  </page> <page sequence="8"> 26 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 only centuries later as urban and courtly life were consolidated during the High Middle  Ages and social value was again associated with the fancy of caring for such creatures  (Bartosiewicz 2011: p. 225). Perception and Imagery D’Arcy thomPson promoted a metric approach to studying living organisms. In his  seminal book (thomPson 1917: p. 719), he referred to Albrecht Dürer’s “Treatise on  Proportion”, pointing out that the principle of coordinates “was in common use in the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by artists in their study of the human form”. Stephen Jay Gould (1980) reversed this idea by applying allometry to art with his 1928– 1953 “evolution” of Mickey Mouse. He measured how cranial proportions of this emblem- atic cartoon character became progressively more juvenile along with the “domestication”  of what had originally been a crude and violent figure. He emphasized that it was “not  sure that the Disney artists themselves explicitly realized what they were doing since the  changes appeared in such a halting and piecemeal fashion” (GoulD 1980: pp. 262–263). Body proportions of another cartoon hero, Garfield the cynical cat created by Jim Davis,  also underwent neotenic changes between 1978–2016. My observation is that in addition  to the enlarged eyes and smaller snout, his hind paws also became longer relative to a  smaller body. This latter change is of special interest as the early growth of peripheral  skeletal parts has been scientifically demonstrated in animal science (Pálsson 1955).  Garfield’s current shape is also a result of protracted changes in design implemented  over 38 years. More complex trends paralleling biological evolution have been eloquently illustrated in  far more detail in the insightful paper by Erich Pucher (1999) devoted to the manifesta- tion of classical evolutionary principles in the development of locomotives. That study  is a tangible illustration of the subtle interplay between pressing practical needs (laws of  physics, geopolitical parameters) and human creativity (economic decisions, design and  fashion) the dual forces defining the size and shape of engines. His important analysis  is also a reminder that while parallels between nature and culture abound, measure and  prudence are imperative in their scholarly interpretations. Within the context of neoteny, this sober, “technological” approach offered a new per- spective on the assertion by Konrad lorenz (1943) that even objects may acquire emo- tional value by association with human morphological features. Working with the devel- opment of domestic breeds as material culture, it was not difficult to expand the idea of  neoteny to inorganic design. Figure 6 shows formal parallels between cranial neoteny  illustrated in previous figures and two emblematic car models. Such striking similarities  in form cannot be imagined without their emotional impact, an indispensable force in  successful marketing. Although no metaphoric animal names used in the car industry  refer to age, extreme chassis shapes compared in this figure are typical of a range of  models, and not only in the early 1960s. </page> <page sequence="9"> Bartosiewicz: Neoteny and design 27 Fig. 6.

Lateral  views, not to scale. “Cute” economy car models evoking animal metaphors were popular in 20th century  European car manufacturing, the best examples being affectionately referred to as the  Käfer (beetle in German: Volkswagen Typ 1) and deux chevaux (two horses in French:  Citroën 2 CV). While the shapes of these two classics are clearly neotenic, their popular  names borrowed from the animal world bear no reference to the concept itself. Interestingly, aside from a classical high-status car bearing the name of a top feline pred- ator, Jaguar, animals associated with aggression are not openly expressed in animal-in- spired car brands. However, the concept seems implicit to the “anti-neotenic” design lik- ened to the wolf skull in Figure 6 that can be observed in the basic shape of many sports  cars. Oversized engines and minimized cabin size make these models reminiscent of the  cranial proportions (large viscerocranium, small neurocranium) of fully grown animals. Conclusions Archaeozoology, a study of animal-human relationships, comprises the evaluation of  animal remains. On the level of interpretation, however, it also requires research into  past and present human-human relationships through the mediation of animals: the use  of animal metaphors and symbols has always reflected human needs and aspirations  ranging from simple nourishment to diverse forms of social self-representation. Critics have pointed out that neoteny as a biological theory is “largely, if not totally, a  bankrupt concept” (shea 1989: p. 97), in part owing to its anthropocentric nature. Naïve  early speculations ranked human races and sexes on the basis of cranial forms. For exam- ple, Causasian females were seen to be at the same evolutionary level as African men or  </page> <page sequence="10"> 28 Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien, Serie A, 120 white children (haeckel 1867). This degree of formalism would be unacceptably racist  and sexist today and is another example of the previously mentioned misconceptions in  biology (Pucher 2013: p. 54). On the other hand, “applied neoteny” manifested in human-made design, ranging from  animal breeds to artwork and industrial forms, reveals the very anthropomorphic nature  of neoteny. The Kindchenschema seems a recurring motif in Western culture, planned to  invoke positive emotions originally associated with its biological interpretations. Life- less objects may gain emotional content from our instinctive reaction to juvenile form  (lorenz 1943). The reasons behind this reaction are complex and manifold. Cars, often  ascribed personalities by their owners, represent a group of products whose shapes may  play on neoteny rather directly. Forms of shoes or furniture would be more difficult to  characterize this way. It would be interesting, however, to find archaeological examples  illustrating the phenomenon outlined in this brief study. References Bartosiewicz, L.
