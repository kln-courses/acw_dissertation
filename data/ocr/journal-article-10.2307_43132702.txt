<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leonardo's «Sala delle Asse» and the Primordial Origins of Architecture John F. Moffitt «Primumque fureis erectis et virgulis interpositis luto parietes texerunt» (Vitruvius, De architectura, II, 2) The so-called Sala delle Asse («Hall of Planks») is situated on the ground-floor of the north-easternmost of the four corner-towers of the Sforza Castle in Milan l. Its plan is square, measuring fifteen meters on each side (i.e., 25 «braccia milanesi»), and the hall itself is covered by Gothic, semi-ribbed vaulting. Four lunettes are situated upon each wall (each 1.75 meters in diameter, providing a 1:3 ratio for the lunette-to-wall relationships) and the outer cir- cumference of each lunette is placed 6.6 meters from the level of the floor (yielding another 1:4 ratio for diameter-to-height). Such simple but consistently ap- plied ratios would appear to be the result of the triangulation methods common to the design prac- tices of medieval masons. To the best of our present knowledge, the original Gothic-style architecture of the Sala dates from 1451, when Francesco Sforza de- cided to reconstruct his new Castello Sforzesco upon the remains of the «Rocca Viscontea» and, it seems, the entirety of this tower was destined from the out- set to guard the ducal treasury. The first mention of this hall as being delle Asse is found in an old document, also noting the treasury function of the entire tower: «la Camera del Tesoro», and dates from the reign of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, who succeeded Francesco Sforza to the dukedom in 1466. In December 1471, Duke Galeazzo ordered va- rious structural renovations in the Castello Sforzesco, including those directly affecting «l'altra [sala] dele asse, in la Camera del Tesoro» 2. In this case, the spe- cific reference was evidently to some wooden scaf- folding, or planking, covering the walls of the room at that time. As is now presumed, those asse had served as a support or ground for certain mural de- corations, further supposed to have been either paint- ings or tapestry-hangings. The original planked wall- coverings (and whatever had covered them) were eventually dismounted, evidently early in year 1498. In any event, this name - Sale delle Asse - has stuck until the present day. Much later, following the occupation of Milan by French troops at the end of the eighteenth-century, the hall was turned into a stable for an artillery troop 76 stationed near the Castle. It was probably at this time that the walls and vaults were completely co- vered with a thick coat of whitewash, such as may be seen even today in other, nearby military barracks. Nevertheless, as late as 1661, according to written testimony, the original, intricately designed and quite illustionistic arboreal decorations (« dipente [...] con suoi telaroni di rovere»), were still visible 3. Final- ly, between 1901 and 1902, the late Quattrocento wall-paintings were finally recovered from behind their limey covering. Seen then for the first time in well over a hundred years in all their sprawling ex- panse, they covered some two-hundred twenty-five square meters (fig. 1). The painstaking restorations were directed by a Milanese scholar, Luca Beltrami, and executed by a local painter, Ernesto Ru- sca 4. Even though the heavy-handed quality of Ru- sca's reconstructions has been frequently criticized, nevertheless their general fidelity to the original composition is granted by scholars. In 1954, a second restoration was carried out by Constantino Baroni, the result of which was a marked lightening of the general effect and, additionally, the discovery of some new fragments of the original scheme. It is now accepted that the design overall, and presumably even much of the tedious physical execu- tion of this highly unusual decorative ensemble is to be credited entirely to the subtle mind and skilled hand of Leonardo da Vinci. Besides the singular ing- enuity of the composition, the principle basis for the attribution to Leonardo is a dated document of April 21, 1498 (which had been published by Beltrami in 1902). In that letter, Gualtiero, one of Ludovico il Moro's courtiers, wrote to the Duke as follows: 111. mo et ex. mo S.ra mio. [...] Lunadi si desarma- ra [i.e., remove the planking in ] la Camera grande dele asse, cioè da la tore. Magistro Leonardo [da Vin- ci] promete finirla per tuto septembre [1498], et [pro- mete] che per questo si potra etiam golder: perche il ponti chel fara lasarano vacuo di soto per tuto [etc.] 5. This letter provides the terminus post quern for a projected undertaking of some six months duration and discusses its preparatory stages, involving the immediate removal of the wooden coverings in order to bare the walls, and explains that erection of the painter's scaffolding will not impair use of the room while the project is underway.

Leonardo , Sala delle Asse: Sforza heraldry of Ludovico il Moro situated in the exact apex of the vaulting of the hall. fore Beltrami published this letter, the attribution to Leonardo of the complex, illusionistic decorations in the Sala delle Asse had been considered indisputable in the later Cinquecento; according to G.P. Lomazzo, who spoke appreciatively of this unique decorative ensemble. Ne gl'arbori altresì si è trovato una bella inven- tane da Leonardo [nella Sala delle Asse], di far che tutti i rami si facciano in diversi gruppi bizarri, la qual foggia uso, canestrandogli tutti 6. Leonardo' a ingeniously woven, « basket-work» (canestraio) pattern of gruppi (meaning either group- ings or, in this case, knots) is both arboreal and architectural at the same time. He imagined for the ceiling and walls of the Salti delle Asse a most striking motif: a verdant covering of conjoined tree branches, gracefully curving overhead in regularized patterns. The resulting trompe l'oeil configuration generally suggests an airy architectural vault and, simul- taneously, gives the specific illusion of being a natu- ral pergola open to the sky. The massive trunks of Leonardo's arbori are represented as growing up- wards from each of the corbels situated at the cor- ners of the lunettes, placed at regular intervals around the four walls. From the deeply rooted base of each giant tree there arises a single sturdy trunk. The shafts of these firmly implanted trunk-pedestals reg- ularly sub-divide themselves - both according to the laws of nature and also conforming to the pré- existant architectural patterns of the Sala s groined vaulting. As they rise higher and higher upwards into 78 the walls of the hall, they further sub-divide into large branching boughs, richly colored and heavy with twigs, ripe fruits and lush green foliage. At the very top of the hall, however, another contrived, or distinctly «un-natural», element is imposed against the bright blue vault of the heavens. Throughout the entire length of the uppermost point of the forested vault, there runs an unmistakably «man-made» motif. A single, unbroken golden strand of rope, looped and interlaced, formally joins together all the diverse, upward-reaching branches into an elaborate- ly knotted canopy pattern. Finally, at the very center of the ceiling, at its highest point, a place roughly corresponding to the domed crossing of a contempor- ary Milanese church (a tiburio ), there appears, keys- tone-like, the heraldic insignia of Ludovico il Moro (fig. 2). The final restoration campaign of 1954 brought to light, on the east wall, a previously unknown frag- ment of Leonardo's original composition, a part sup- pressed half a century earlier by Beltrami and Rusca, who only thought it a later addition. In the fragmen- tary remains gnarled tree-roots can be seen vigorous- ly insinuating their way through the uinderlying, stratified rock formations. This discovery suggests that Leonardo probably intended in a consistent manner to show all the many trees in the hall as first breaking forth by natural and irrepressible force from the rocky bowels of the earth, thence rising up- wards inexorably in order eventually to create his «natural» pergola. However, in its second, literally higher stage, this process of vigorous and unchecked natural growth has been forcefully reshaped into a kind of primordial architecture. In short, Leonardo's initially undisciplined stand of trees has been finally transmuted into an «artifact», a pergola, that is, a thing unmistakably recast through the intervention of the hand of man. The opportune intrusion of man- kind into this unchecked, primitive wilderness scheme is metaphorically represented by the imposi- tion of the intricately woven rope-pattern, itself a de- cidedly «un-natural» element. Hence, vigorous and unchecked «Nature» is deliberately contrasted to stylized human artifice, or «proto-architecture». The documents examined here have answered the art historian's most basic questions, namely: Who commissioned the unique painted decorations for the Sala delle Asse (Ludovico il Moro); when it was ordered and most likely completed (1498); who had composed and executed (at least in part) the striking- ly original pictorial cycle (Leonardo da Vinci). Given these facts, now, even though any documentary evi- dence regarding the symbolic intention of the «Sala delle Asse» is wholly lacking, one must recreate the raison d'être of this unusual iconographie cycle. In the event, the visual evidence alone tells us that, basical- ly, the underlying theme directly has something to say about a general inclusive theme, what we might call «Wild Nature Tamed into Architecture». This idea in turn suggests that one is dealing with a kind of metaphorical and rather rudimentary «History of Arcitecture», but one exclusively viewed in its very earliest stages, or primordial origins. Nevertheless, in order to prove the validity of this new comprehensive</page><page sequence="4">interpretation, one must additionally be able to de- monstrate the currency of such ideas in Italian, parti- cularly Milanese, circles at this time, further showing the relevancy of such underlying ideas to Leonardo's known practical and theoretical interests. Finally, the immediate relevancy of this concetto must be directly related, as a flattering reference point, to the modern Maecenas who had commissioned it, Ludovi- co il Moro, famed as an enlightened patron of the arts and letters in Milan. As one might expect, to date several, quite diffe- rent, interpretations have been already advanced to solve the persistant riddle of what has always been viewed as one of Leonardo's most problematic works. Nevertheless, there is a general similarity in these published opinions. Some scholars would merely dis- miss the cycle as a personal capriccio - which is really to say nothing at all. For example, Jurgis Bal- trušaitis takes a typically modernist, or formalist point of view, stating, «C'est tout d'abord, un ex- ercice d'addresse sur des formes pures, un jeu d'esprit» 1 . Luca Beltrami, however, sought a rela- tionship with common pursuits in Leonardo's oeuvre, namely, «la sua simpatia per gli intrecci di corde adattati a schema geometrico» 8. This idea of an on- going series of self-centered «knotty problematics» has since been also championed by A.K. Coomaras- wamy, Kenneth Clark and Götz Pochât 9. More credi- ble, I believe, has been a more «literary» approach, that is, one taking Leonardo's Sala delle Asse as repre- senting the illustration of a given, traditional and textually transmitted, topos . Such a topos- interpretation has been pursued by Maria G. Agghazy, who reads the cycle as a representation of the conventionalized literary motifs of the locus amoenus and the vinculum delie torum, concluding that «ici les noeuds sont encore plus expressivement les liens du peché», an idea that I find in the end neither germane to Leonardo nor to Ludovico 10. This is however quite similar to ther idea advanced by Volker Hoffmann (but reiterating a topic originally developed by E.R. Curtius). According to Hoffmann, Leonardo's setting «ist Tempe in Thessalien, und 'Tempe' ist ein alter literarischer Topos» n. Nevertheless, as described by Theopompus, Pliny and Aelian, Tempe was consistently characterized as being an uninhabited wilderness; as such, it was of course «pre-architectural». More telling is the fact that Tempe was always to be identified by a rushing acqueous element, a feature notably absent in the Sala delle Asse . As Curtius succinctly puts it, «The Vale of Tempe, an ideal example of landscpae beauty as the ancients understood it, singularly combines the charm of a river valley with the wildness and grandeur of a deep rocky gorge». In concrete topog- raphical terms, this amenable site is to be so identi- fied by «the River Peneus [which] passes through a gorge formed by the steep slopes of Ossa and Olimpus» 12. In short, Hoffmann's ingenious and learned argument is ultimately vitiated by the total absence of any overt sign of riverine activities in Leonardo's fresco. The real problem with these often interesting topoi-derived interpretations is that they all fail to explain the presence of the real theme of the fresco, obviously centered on Leonardo's unique but all- important, enframing architectural metaphor. As Ambrogio Annioni usefully points out, «the distribu- tion of the pictorial ornament is in studied spon- taneous accord with the architectural structure it is designed to cover». Therefore, «the conception of the highly original motif of the 'Sala delle Asse' is clear- ly, organically architectural». Nevertheless, even Annioni does not interpret the possible symbolic sig- nificance of the proto-architectural macrocosm, but merely observes its strictly visual analogies with Leonardo's microcosmic «studies for knots and closed or interlaced tracery, scattered among the 3 .

In fact, on one level the underlying purpose of the Sala delle Asse was, as Carlo Pedretti suggested, «showing how painting could provide an architectural model: the trees replacing the columns, and their branches con- stituting the ribs of a Gothic vaulted room». In arriv- ing at this conclusion Pedretti also took into account the results of the restorations of 1954, revealing the tree-roots bursting through the rocky subterranean stratifications, a motif he interprets as a «finzione of the powers and intrincacy of the generative processes of nature, rationalized into a scheme of geometrical order». As he finally concluded however, alas, «its iconography is lost to us» 14 . In order to retrieve the meaning and traditional sources of Leonardo's odd pictorial concetto, which is in fact based on a standard literary topos , one needs to concentrate particularly upon the architectural- historical literature known in Leonardo's time. In her exhaustive monograph on painted iconographical cy- cles depicting Garden , Landscape , and Paradise Motifs (1967), Eva Börsch-Supan has come closest to iden- tifying the original enframing idea 15 . Even though she failed in the end to identify the literary work in question, she did nevertheless manage (as Pedretti did not) to specify the specific architectural- historical theme employed by Leonardo: «Ein Laubhütte als Urform menschlichen Bauens» 16. To document her assertion in contemporary terms, she cited the authority of Leon Battista Alberti's De re aedificatoria, first published in Florence in 1485, but circulating in manuscript from some decades pre- viously. For Börsch-Supan, two passages in particu- lar seem particularly fitting for the context of Leonardo's Sala delle Asse. For instance, as she pointed out 17, in De re aed., IX, iv, one finds mentions of the therapeutic advantages of certain painted de- corations, what Alberti called «alcuni ornamenti che possono essere usati nelle abitazioni private», includ- ing such locus amoenus motifs as «pitture raffiguran- ti sorgenti e ruscelli», but, again, these are acqueous motifs which are of course quite absent in Leonardo's pictorial cycle. However, Alberti adds that, addi- tionally, «l'animo nostro infatti si rallegra in sommo grado alla vista di dipinti raffiguranti plaghe ridenti, porti, vivai, zone di caccia, specchi d'aqua, diver- timenti agresti, paesaggi coperti di vegetazione e fioriti» 18. In this case however, it is clear that the architect-theoretist was referring to wholly «natural» raffiguranti and, therefore, in the end Alberti's na- ture-motifs bear absolutely no relation to the proto- architectural leit-motiv that so distinguishes Leonar- do's unique ensemble. Pursuing her essentially correct idea of Leonar- do's cycles as a representation of what she called «a leafy hut as the primordial form of human architec- ture», Börsch-Supan cites 19 a curious, extended pas- sage where Alberti (De re aed., IX, 1) extolls - that is, in their "proper" context - the employment of co- lumns that simulate, among other motifs, the appear- ance of living trees, a modif she calls Baumsäulen. As Alberti put it, Nell'ornare gli edifici privati, dunque, bisognerà avere un severissimo senso del limite; sebbene nella 80 maggior parte dei casi sia consentita una certa libertà. [...] Anzi, l'allontanarsi d'alcun poco dalla severità e dalla normatività vigilatissima del disegno [negli edi- fici privati], il che nelle opere pubbliche non è ammes- so, in queste altre talora contribuisce anche alla piace- volezza delle forme. E molta leggiadria conferiva il fa- re ciò che solevano architetti brillantissimi [come] il collocare, soprattutto nei loggiati dei giardini, colonne fatte ad imitazione di tronchi d'albero con le nodosità recise, o di fasci tenuti insieme da cinghie, o altre an- cora tortili o palmate o con la superficie ruvida di fra- sche o coperta di uccellini [...] Inoltre in funzione di capitelli foggiavano canestri traboccanti d'uva e di frutti, o una palma coi rami fio- riti sulla cima, o viluppi di serpi intrecciati con varie- tà di nodi, o aquile agitanti le ali, o teste di Gorgone crinite di serpenti in lotta, e altre consimili figurazioni che sarebbe troppo lungo elencare 20 . Unfortunately, Börsch-Supan failed to cite another passage in De re aedificatoria, in which Alberti does in fact appear to paraphrase the Urtext that proves to be the fons et origo of Leonardo's arboreal concetto. In fact, as derived from the common literary source, both the «Sala delle Asse» and Alberti's statement represent evidence for a latent humanist undercur- rent, that which I would call the «architectural pri- mitivism» of the Renaissance. This idea, little stu- died as yet, in effect extolls the «naturai», or nature- analogue, qualities of certain kinds of architecture, an effect demonstrated (even «proven») by a pseudo- historical discussion of architecture's own «natural» origins. As we see, Alberti's understanding of the matter (De re aed., II, iv) was based upon indisput- able, ancient authority: Riferiremo ora quanto hanno scritto i dotti del- l'antichità trattando dei materiali utili alla costruzio- ne. [...] Le elencheremo dunque riunendole dai molti passi sparsi in cui i migliori autori antichi le hanno trattate; aggiungeremo però, secondo il solito, quegli elementi che abbiamo ricavato dall'osservazione diret- ta delle opere antiche o dai consigli di artisti provetti, e che in qualche modo possono essere utili al nostro discorso. Mi pare conveniente iniziare la trattazione, se- guendo un ordine naturale, dal tipo di materiale che per primo venne utilizzato dagli uomini per costruire: cioè, se non erro, il legname ricavato dagli alberi ce- dui nelle foreste. Tuttavia su questo punto gli autori discordano. Alcuni affermano che da principio l'uomo abitava nelle caverne, riparandosi insieme, padroni e greggi, sotto la stessa ombra; e danno credito a quanto narra Plinio, che per primo un certo Gelio Tassio [ Te - xius : «the weaver-braider»], imitando la natura, si co- struì una casa con il fango. [...] Eusebio Panfilo, dotto indagatore di antichità, sostiene, in base ad antiche testimonianze, che furono i discendenti di Protogono che escogitarono le abitazioni per gli uomini, intrec- ciando foglie di canna palustre e papiro. Ma torniamo al nostro discorso [...] 21 . In short, for Alberti, just as for Leonardo (among many others), at that time the single most authorita- tive Urtext available for all matters touching upon V architettura (including its putative history) would have been, naturally, Vitruvius. Further, it will be re- called how, before 1500, the only published</page><page sequence="6">6. F ïlarete, The Primitive Hut, ca. 1464. Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale . 7.

Building in the First Ages of Men on Earth (Cesariano, Vitruvius, 1521). 81</page><page sequence="7">architectural treatises were those by Vitruvius and Alberti, a factor neatly restricting the field of neces- sary inquiry. In order to demonstrate Leonardo's knowledge, even veneration, of Vitruvius' canonic text, it is necessary to reiterate some well known arguments about a famous image, the so-called «Vitruvian Fi- gure» (fig. 3), customarilly dated around 1490, which is to say about eight years prior to the known date of the paintings in the Sala delle Asse. This drawing is accompanied by an autograph text (ms. in the Accademia, Venice) that clearly ex- plains its wholly theoretical purposes: «Vetruuio archi tecto mette nella sua opera di ar- chi tectura che le misure dell'omo sono della natura distribuite in questo modo...» 22 and then Leonardo proceeds to paraphrase the authoritative text found in the De architectura composed by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (Vetruuio). In this case, the passage quoted in Leonardo's handwriting has its source in Book III, chapter 1, articles lv 23 . For our purposes, the following factors are of primary importance in this particular text-picture combinations: (1) it clearly demonstrates Leonardo's intimate familiarity with Vitruvius' canonical text, leading us additionally to conclude that, (2) for Leonardo, this book was taken to represent a com- pilation of truly authoritative art-theoretical state- ments. As one further infers, (3) Leonardo interpreted Vitruvius' principles as conforming to the very work- ings and laws of Nature herself: «sono [derivate] del- la natura», as he succinctly put it. Additionally, and as is proven by Leonardo's drawing (4) the artist be- lieved Vitruvius' prestigious statements to constitute a proper vehicle for the practise of ekphrasis, and (5) in this particular instance, the ekphrasis has larger, strictly theoretical purposes. Finally, (6) the drawing proves that Leonardo knew - and directly utilized - Vitruvius' text some years before his conception of the arboreal cycle executed for Ludovico il Moro. The Sala delle Asse in fact can now be best under- stood to represent just another ekphrasis by Leonar- do, in this case another one derived from Vitruvius' canonic text, specifically De architectura , libri decern , Book I, chapter 1, articles 1 ff. The larger topic (as Rahmenthema) embraced by Vitruvius is «the primi- tive hut», itself representing the primordial origins of all (human) architecture 24. Therefore, Leonardo would have read in his copy of Vitruvius (just as Alberti did before him) the following circumstantial statement dealing with the «natural origins» of all architectural practice: The Origin of the Dwelling House The men of old were born like the wild beasts, in woods, caves, and groves, and lived on savage fare. [...] As they kept coming together in greater numbers into one place, finding themselves naturally gifted beyond the other animals in not being obliged to walk with faces to the ground, but upright and gazing upon the splendor of the starry firmament, and also in being able to do with ease whatever they chose with their hands and fingers, they began in that first assem- bly to construct shelters. Some made them of breen 82 bought [de fronde f acere], others dug caves on moun- tain sides, and some, in imitation of the nests of swal- lows and the way they built, made places of refuge out of mud and twigs [de... virgulis f acere]. Next, by observing the shelters of others, and adding new de- tails to their own inceptions, they constructed better and better kinds of huts [casae] as time went on. In what immediately follows, Vitruvius is obviously most fascinated by the theme of the primi- tive proto-house cleverly fabricated from «green bought» (a «Bauhaus» architecture, avant la lettré): At first, they set up forked stakes connected by woven twigs [fureis erectis et virgulis interpositis ... pa- ñetes texerunt ] and covered these walls with mud. [...] Finding that such roofs could not stand the rain dur- ing storms of winter, they built them with peaks daubed with mud, the roofs sloping and projecting, so as to carry off the rain-water. That houses originated as I have written above, this we can see for ourselves from the buildings that are, to this day, constructed in like materials by foreign [trans-Alpine, Germanic] tribes. For [...] erect, vertically standing, tree-trunks form the walls [ex quattuor partibus... pañetes arbo- ribus statuentes ad perpendiculum] and enclose the space for the dwelling [...] and so, proceeding with their walls of trees laid perpendicularly above the lowest, they built up high towers. [...] As for the roofs, by cutting away the end of the cross-beams, and mak- ing them converge gradually as they lay them across, they bring them up to the top from the four sides in the shape of a pyramid. They cover it with leaves and mud, and thus construct the roofs of their towers in a rude form of the «tortoise» style [more testudinata]. Having so described his curious premonition of the pyramidal towers of the great Romanesque and Gothic cathedral fronts, Vitruvius then concludes by announcing his evolutionary-revolutionary thesis: the great art historical and even cultural significance of those primitive structures: From these early beginnings, and from the fact that Nature had not only endowed the human race with senses like the rest of the animals, but had also equipped their minds with the powers of thought and understanding, thus putting all other animals under their sway, they next gradually advanced from the construction of buildings to the other arts and scien- ces [gradatim progressi ad ceteras artes et disciplinas], and so passed from a rude and barbarous mode of life to civilization and refinement. Then, taking courage, and looking forward from the standpoint of higher ideas, born of the multiplication of the arts [ex varietate artium natis], they gave up huts [casas], and began to build houses [domos] with foundations, hav- ing brick or stone walls, and roofs of timber and tiles 25 . In analyzing Vitruvius's statements, two interest- ing features emerge. In the first place, on the strictly physical or technical level, the Roman auctoritas une- quivocably states that all architecture had initially developed from the rustic or sylvan hut, a «place of refuge», made by setting up barely trimmed saplings, that is «forked stakes connected by woven twigs». This plaited, proto-vaulted structure naturally de-</page><page sequence="8">scribed a pyramidal or pointed configuration: «they made them with peaks... the roofs sloping... in the shape of a pyramid». The lateral supports for the pointed and leafy-woven canopy above were literally «walls of trees», which, we are led to infer, were in fact still-living, rooted trees: «four trees enclose the space for the dwelling», which, in fact, the primor- dial builders did «cover with leaves», perhaps still living ones. On the second level of understanding, Vitruvius employs this historical paradigm as a metaphor representing the complete picture of the history of mankind's eventual rise to enlightenment or civilization: «They gradually advanced from the construction of buildings [directly] to the other arts and sciences». Therefore, the image of a primordial leafy-bough house potentially represents the historic- al origins of Art itself, besides that of (merely) V ar- chitettura, arising from leafy, natural «huts», even- tually coming to encompass «houses with founda- tions, having brick or stone walls». The picture so vividly drawn in Vitruvius' text of the historical origins of the building arts, architectura that has directly arisen from the fabrication of the primordial-rustic living-tree-shelter - a rude edifice, as it were laying down the intellectual foundations for the subsequente erection of the Liberal Arts in general - proved to be an ubiquitous theme in the history of post-Quattrocento architectural theory. As this topic has already been studied in great detail by Joseph Rykwert 26, one needs only cite a very similar picture drawn by the Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier in his Essai sur l'architecture (1755) (figura 4). In the frontispiece of his Essai , Laugier depicts the lady-like and elegant personification of L'architecture who points with an admonitory finger towards Vitruvius' Urbau, shown - like Leonardo's pergola in the Sala delle Asse - to have been fabricated from living tree- trunks, the plaited, intertwined branches of which form a living, pyramidal, leafy, open-work canopy overhead. For Laugier, this primitive hut- construction serves as the true exemplar for modern architects, just as his Vitruvian-derived text makes perfectly clear when he invites his readers to consid- er the case of: L'homme [qui] veut se faire un logement que le couvre sans l'ensevelir. Quelques branches abbatués dans la forêt sont les matériaux propres à son dessein. Il en choisit quatr [troncs] des plus fortes qu'il élève perpendiculairement et qu'il dispose en quarré. Au-dessus il en met quatre autres en travers, et sur celles-ci il en éleve qui s'inclinent, et qui se réunissent en point de deux côtes. Cette espece de toit est couvert de feuilles [vivants] assez serrées pour ni le soleil, ni la pluie ne puissent y pénétrer: et voilà l'homme [est] lo- gé. As did Vitruvius before him (representing the obvious model for this picturesque passage), Laugier states that this humble, yet living structure is the veritable model of la Nature and, additionally, that is repre- sents the exemplary, quintessentially «natural», model for all that is potentially best in architecture: Telle est la marche de la simple Nature: c'est à l'imitation de ses procédés que l'art doit sa naissance. La petite cabane rustique que viens de décrire, est la modèle sur lequel on a imaginé toutes les magnifi- cences de l'architecture. C'est en se rapprochant dans l'exécution de la simplicité de ce premier modèle que l'on évite les défauts essentielles, que l'on saisit les perfections véritables 27 . Whereas Laugier's retrospective, Rousseau-like nostalgia for an arcadian-architectural «Golden Age» certainly demonstrates the currency of the idea of the Vitruvian Urbau as late as the eighteenth-century, one must of course turn to other sources in order to demonstrate its ubiquity in Leonardo's time. In the first place, particularly provocative is a body of strictly visual documentation supporting the idea of a commonly held interest in «primitivist» architectu- ral expression in the Quattrocento. Of primary im- portance in this case are a number of columns and other supportative architectural elements that give the illusion of being (or just remaining) roughly- hewn «tree-trunks» 28 . One example of these « living- tree-columns» was designed by Bramante, and is still to be seen in the loggia of the Canonica of S. Ambro- gio in Milan, an old feature most likely attributable to Alberti 's expressed fondness for those «colonne fat- te ad imitazione di tronchi d'albero», sometimes seen in private dwellings, «with knots in the shafts in im- itation of trees that have had their branches cut off». Having thus situated the motif in Milan, it will be useful now to place such «neo- Vitruvian» architectural metaphors dealing with the primordial woodsy hut directly into the ambient of the Sforza court. As it turns out, such an interest can be demon- strated here, and at least two decades prior to the execution of the «Sala delle Asse». In this case, the proof is furnished by Filarete's Trattato di Architettura , the composition of which has been cred- ibly dated between 1461 and 1464 and which was ori- ginally dedicated to none other than Francesco Sforza 29 . In fact, the first (now lost) manuscript copy of Filarete's «Treatise» had been placed in the ducal library, perhaps even in the «Camera del Tesoro», and here it was very likely to have been studied by Leonardo, already assumed to have known the work for other reasons 30. In the only reliable fifteenth- Century copy surviving, the «Medici Manuscript» (Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale: Magliabechianus, II, iv, 140) one sees that Filare te had already depicted in some detail (folio 5, recto and verso) the occasion of the erection of the primitive hut, described by Fila- rete as being the original source of all subsequent architecture (fig. 6, 7). Again, the textual source of the concept is unmistakable; as Rudolf Wittkower points, out «this idea arose, of course, as a counter- part to the Vitruvian legend of the origin of the Doric style from primitive wooden structures» 31 . Besides citing Vitruvius, Filarete has also attempted to recon- cile his classical source with the early history of man as recounted in the Bible; hence, he explained the subject matter of the first of his two pen and wash drawings, depicting Vitruvio-Adam, as follows: Ora è da vedere onde è derivato l'edificio e perché necessita la prima volta fu trovato. [...] Non è dubbio che lo hedificare fu trovato dal huomo chi fusse il pri- 83</page><page sequence="9">mo che facesse case e habitatione certo non abbiamo. Ma è da credere che subito che Adamo fu cacciato del paradizo e piovendo e non avendo altro più presto ri- covero le mani in capo per difendersi dall'acqua. [...] E da credere che avendo Adamo fattosi tetto delle ma- ni, considerato il bisogno per lo suo vivere, si pensò a ingengossi di farsi qualche habitatione per difendersi d'aquesti pioggie e anche dal caldo [e] del sole. [...] A me pare secondo il mio oppinione che lui fusse il pri- mo che trovasse habitatione cioè o case, o vuoi dire capanne. Vero che Vitruvio dice che il primo che tro- varono habitatione furono quelli primi che habitarono in selve, e loro fecero cappane e grotte il meglio che loro seppono opure come si fusse [;] il stimo cLe fusse il primo. [Fu] Adamo [dico io], per le ragion sopra det- te, pure chi si fusse tanto e che i primi origini furono overo di rivorono da queste necessità per la vita del huono 32 . Elsewhere (folio 54 verso), Filarete discourses (in his typically garbled fashion) upon the origins of the classical column, again in a way that is obviously de- rived from Vitruvius' authoritative «historical» account: Il primo origine delle colonne si fu che quando furono farne le prime habitationi. La necessità insegnò che volendo fare una capanna (o mior dire frascato), o quello si fusse prima, mozzo uno legno, il quale aveva due rami sparti, l'uno allo posito dell'altro, tagliatogli rami e due del pari rimase forcelluto. Donde che faro- ne quattro in quella forma e fittole in terra e messi poi quattro altri legni, atraverso sopra di queste, come per questo disegno si può vedere e questo modo si comin- ciò a fare i primi origine delle colonne. Di poi secondo le cose sue modo più lumando e pulendo. Fu dato aquesti con tali sustentaculi misura, forma e propor- tione e nome e anche derivatione, come che è detto dello hedificio nel primo che è derivato e formato dal huono, così è proprio la colonna 33 . Additionally in Florence around 1495 (that is, only slightly before the execution of the decoration in the Sala delle Asse), Piero di Cosimo also had depicted the erection of the Vitruviañ primordial hut in an easel-painting (National Gallery, Ottawa), the subject of which Erwin Panofsky had identified as represent- ing Vulcan and his faithful disciples and helpers (fig. 5) 34 . Here again we see (right center) the construction of that first «primitive hut» (Filarete's capanna ), made from unsquared tree- trunks, a motif appropri- ate in this case because Vulcan, according to the myt- rographers, was to be credited with, among other arts and crafts, the invention of architecture. As a likely textual source for Piero's understanding of Vul- can's historical status as a primordial architectus, Panofsky cited Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Pagan Gods, written between 1350 and 1375, and subse- quently published in Venice as early as 1492. Howev- er, when one bothers to consult this popular mytho- logical manual for the story of Vulcan ( Genealogia deorum, XII, 70), it suddenly becomes apparent that Boccaccio had himself chosen to quote in extenso from Vitruvius' statements about the fabrication of the primitive capanna, including striking details of its roof, woven from still-living tree-tops 35. In short, it appears that it was the specifically «Vitruviañ» 84 9. Leonardo , How an Armature Makes an Ornament of Build- ings, ca . 1497 (?). Paris, Institut de France . 10.

Whether or not Boccaccio was in fact Piero's textual source (although this seems most likely), it becomes evident that the historiciz- ing, wholly Vitruvius-derived, arboreal-primeval architectural motif had become common knowledge in Italy by the end of the fifteenth-century. This is a point further documented by a detailed citation of the primitivist Vitruvian hut ( capanna ) found in the Trattato written (ca. 1481/91) by a Sienese author an- xious to «re-do» Vitruvius, the painter-sculptor- architect Francesco di Giorgio di Martini 36 . Another important written reference (ca. 1515/ 20) to the woodsy Urbau, that primordial «natural» architectural prototype, appears in a report discus- sing the state of contemporary architecture in Rome 37. Addressing himself to an unnamed Pope, usually assumed to have been Leo X, the author of this letter, generally believed to have been Raphael (although Castiglione and Peruzzi have also been suggested) 38, deplores the activities of those foreign barbarians who had occupied the Holy City during the Middle Ages, then stripping its ancient buildings of their marble and brick. According to this author, thus was the classical style corrupted and, as a re- sult, the «German» {tedesca) style, of architecture cam&amp; to prevail in its place. As described by «Raphael», this post-classical mode has, neverthe- less, some redeeming merits. Moreover, as he makes clear, it was constructed exactly in the same way as is the simulated, «arboreal» and «pointed», vaulting of Leonardo's Sala delle Asse , that is, with interlaced tree-branches intricately bound together (perhaps even by knotted rope-patterns). This correspondent additionally draws the proper connections between the «German» kind of primordial «woven arboreal vaulting» and the familiar statements by Vitruvius regarding the historical origins of strictly «classical» architecture. Finally, both of these building styles, as «Raphael» explicitly states, are derived from what one might call a natural , even «botanical», operation. As will also be noted, the verbal picture drawn by this Italian of what he called « l'archi tectura tedesca» exactly corresponds to the characteristics of «la pe- tite cabane rustique» to be limned in so many years later by Laugier (fig. 4). As «Raphael» had argued, in spite of its many self-evident defects: 85</page><page sequence="11">Pur, questa architectura [tedesca] ebbe qualche ragione pero che nacque dali arbori non ancor tagliati, alli quali, piegati li rami e relegati insieme, fanno li lor terzi acuti. E, benché questa origine non sia in tut- to da spressare, pur è debile, perché molto più regge- rebono le capanne fatte di travi incatenati, e posti a uso di colonne con li colmi loro e coprimenti, como descrive Victruvio della origine dell'opera dorica. As this expert continues, in spite of its Vitruvian pedigree, this arbor-architecture is, besides being structurally weak, naturally not so pleasing to the eye as is classical architecture, postulated upon the perfect circles naturally generated by arches: Oltra la debolezza, el terzo acuto [tedesco] non ha quella grazia all'occhio nostro, al qual piace la perfec- zione del circulo: e vedesi che la natura non cerca qua- si altra forma. [...] Della origine delle [colonne] e for- ma scrive difusamente Victruvio, al qual rimettemo chi vorrà averne maggior notizia. Noi, secondo che oc- currerà, dichiaremo li ordini de tacce presuponendo le cose di Victruvio 39 . As this author (if Ráphael, then very likely in direct consultation with Bramante) stated, such pri- moridal «proto-architectural» techniques express a fundamental way of understanding Nature, of approaching it, of mediating it through the imposi- tion of human artifice, even if this process of evolving rationalization is only expressed through the sim- plest of means. As I believe, such was also the metaphorical significances of Leonardo's Sala delle Asse . Viewed retrospectively, the various duplica- tions in the Renaissance of such «primitivizing» or «pre-historical» building techniques are a way of making nature-derived armatures serve, as it was then punt, «to make an ornament out of buildings». In fact, Leonardo himself appears to have referred to this concept in some detail in his «Notebooks», in a passage fittingly entitled «Modo come si fano i arma- ture per fare ornamento di edifiti». The drawing accompanying the passage in question (fig. 9 Ms. B., f. 28v) shows ribbed, or Gothic, vaulting springing from corbels attached to colonnettes inserted into the four corners of a square-plan hall. In the lower left of the manuscript page (where the text properly begins) one sees an oblong, woven, mat-like object in three sections: l'armature. The text, however, may strike one as being yet another operational paraphrase of Vitruvius' famous description of the initial, plaited- branches, stages of the fabrication of the hypothetic- al-historical «primitive hut», derived from Nature and, as it were, woven from the trunks of still-living saplings. As Leonardo described it, this represents the: Modo come si fano i armature per fare ORNAMENTO DI EDIFITI. Sia da l'uno all'altro cerchio uno 1/2 bracchio e'1 ginepro si da; regiere colle cime in giù cominciando di sotto; A questa colonna si lega d'intorno 4 pertiche, dintorno alle quali s'inchioda vinchi grossi uno dito, e poi si fa da pie e vassi in alto legando mazzuoli di cime di ginepro colle cime in basso cioè sotto sopra. 86 Modo come si debonno mettere le pertiche per legare i mazzioli de' ginepri sopra esse pertiche, le quali sono confitte sopra l'armatura della volta e lega essi maz- zuoli con salci e su per fare cimerosa colle forbici e lavora le con salci 40 . As one infers from this autograph statement, in the Sala delle Asse decorations Leonardo meant (in part) to «ornamentalize» a pre-existent ribbed- vaulting, «tedesca», architectural structure. To these ends, he employed the motif of still-living and inter- laced, «real» shrubs and trees which, he said, should be bound and woven together, from top to bottom. Even though Leonardo's statement additionally does appear to reiterate certain particulars of Vitruvius' description of the construction techniques of the first dwelling, made from four living trees and covered by a leafy roof-bower, «in a rude form of the 'tortoise' style», one should not take this passage from the «Notebooks» ad literarally representing the program- me of the Sala delle Asse, even though this same «Codex B» (f. 15) does include architectural drawings of the northeast tower of the Castello Sforzesco pre- sently housing Leonardo's arboreal-architectural fantasy41. As seems more likely, this text probably antedates the execution of the paintings in the Sala delle Asse, in which case it mainly serves to show Leonardo's awareness of the Vitruvian descriptions of the construction methods of the fabled Urbau. In any event, as we know from Leonardo's «Vitruvian Figure» (fig. 3), the artist had been making ekphraseis from the De architectura since around 1490. As we have also seen, the letter by «Raphael» seems to support the further conclusion that Leonar- do's contemporaries commonly equated the charac- teristics of «German» (Gothic) style architecture - particularly its pointed, ribbed-vaulting - with the primordial, interlaced « bough-house» style associ- ated with the historical origins of all the arts of man- kind. Of course, for such conclusions, Vitruvius was inevitably cited as the principal auctoritas . In the case of the Sala delle Asse, it is similarly obvious that Leonardo's fictive trees take the place of, in fact they literally cover the pre-existant groining patterns of the ceiling vaults constructed some thirty-five years previous to the execution of his murals. As may be also allowed, were he familiar with this unique picto- rial cycle, then «Raphael» would have said that Leonardo's illusionistically painted pergola, in fact as it was stated in the letter, «originated by the tak- ing of branches of uncut trees, binding them together, and bending them to construct pointed arches». In short, the author of the memorandum likely would have read this ensemble as representing a clever simulation of the principles underlying «l'ar- chitectura tedesca», additionally recognizing, in the strictly «historical» sense, Leonardo's fresco-cycle to be, more or less, the depiction of «come descrive Vic- truvio della origine dell'opera dorica». In the event, Wittkower had already concluded that In the eyes of men like Raphael, the saving grace of the maniera tedesca was probably the notion that Greek [i.e., all classical] architecture and German [i.e.,</page><page sequence="12">Gothic] architecture had one thing in common: they were both imitative arts, derived from Nature 42 . What remains now is: (1) to demonstrate Leonar- do's actual working knowledge of «German architecture», and (2) to show the adoptation of spe- cifically Vitruvian principles into the ambitious building programmes of the Sforza Dukes. To these demonstrations, there must be added a third, seemingly anomalous point, namely that within the circle of Lombard architectural theory of this time there had even been attempts to reconcile Vitruvian and Late Gothic structures and principles. On the one hand, in the late 1480s, that is around the time his «Vitruvian Figure» was designed, Leonardo had become involved, along with Bra- mante, in the on-going construction (since 1386) of the Duomo of Milan, a complicated chapter in the history of architecture discussed in some detail by Rudolf Wittkower43. Specifically, Leonardo's con- crete contribution to this major enterprise were some plans and sketches for the new tower over the cros- sing of the Cathedral, the Tiburio (fig. 10). As one of Leonardo's surviving drawings amply attests {Codice Atlantico , f. 310), the aspiring architect was not only completely familiar with the orthodox «pointed style» of medieval vaulting but, in addition, as Witt- kower observes, «he, too, was seeking conformity with the Late Gothic style of the Cathedral» 44 . Moreover, as Wolfgang Lötz had shown some years ago 45, Ludovico il Moro, the future patron of the Sala delle Asse , had ordered the Piazza Ducale in Vigevano (thirty-five kilometers distant from Milan) to be reor- dered, beginning in 1492, in strict conformance to Vitruvian principles. The significance of this particu- lar neo- Vitruvian enterprise for the history of urban- ism is undeniable; as Lötz remarks This is the first example since antiquity of a piaz- za built in one campaign, and surrounded by uniform arcades [as] an imitation of a Roman forum. The ancient type of [civic] square, however, was known to the Renaissance exclusively through a literary source, namely the treatise of Vitruvius. [...] Leonardo worked for Ludovico il Moro in both Milan and Vigevano. Further, we can assume that the 1486 editio princeps of Vitruvius was known among the humanists of the Milanese court. [...] [Concerning] the new distinctive formal aspects of the piazza in Vigevano [...] all the features are found in Vitruvius. [...] In Vigevano the example was not of an ancient building - there were, after all, no longer any ancient fora to be seen - but rather the text of Vitruvius. [...] Surely, it can be taken for granted that Leonardo and Bramante discussed the project when they were together at the court of the Sforzas 46. By way of further support for our principal thesis, identifying an underlying «Vitruvian-Gothic» concept in Leonardo's Sala delle Asse project, a final point is to demonstrate is that such an equation was possible, even current, in architectural theory in this time and in this place. For this, we return to consider the matter of the building of the Milanese Duomo. Cesare Cesariano had been a pupil of Bramante's and thus, as one may presume as a matter of course, he was also a familiar of Leonardo da Vinci. In 1521 Cesariano published his famous edition of Vitruvius 47. In this case, what interests us here are the Roman architect's canonical assesments (De arch,, II, 1) of the fundamental propositions of correct design, that namely: Order gives due measure to the members of a work considered separately, and symmetrical agree- ment to the proportions. [...] By this I mean the selec- tion of modules [taken] from the members of the work itself. [...] Arrangement includes the putting of things in their proper place and [...] its forms of expression (in Greek, ideai) are these: ground-plan, elevation, and perspective. [...] Symmetry is the proper agreement between the members of the work itself. [...] Thus in the human body there is a kind of symmetrical har- mony between forearm, foot, palm, finger, and other small parts; and so it is with perfect buildings 48 . Of course what we have here is the same princi- ple that also is the idea basis of Leonardo's famous «Vitruvian Figure» (fig. 3). Be that as it may, what is truly striking is the fact that Cesariano chose to illus- trate the component ideas of Vitruvius' statement ab- out what constitutes the «perfect building» by de- picting the thoroughly medieval structure of the Duomo of Milan (figs. 11, 12), thereby producing what Wittkower reckoned to be the «extraordinary inclusion of a Gothic building in the classical text». In this case it may be assumed (since this author nev- er explitcitly stated what so motivated him) that, for Cesariano, the Vitruvian principles of proportionate geometria were timeless; as such they were not behol- den to merely temporal stylistic distinctions. Witt- kower therefore concluded that «the reign of the square, and of the circle - the latter two absolute essentials of classical and Renaissance aesthetics - demonstrated the validity of Late Gothic geometry, germanico more (as Cesariano put it [on both his plates illustrating the Duomo of Milan]), within a classical Vitruvian system» 49. Moreover, but not surprisingly, Cesariano, the modern Milanese translator of Vitruvius, not only knew of the Roman author's prototypical «primitive hut», but even chose to illustrate in his book the opportune manner of its momentous erection, leafy boughs and all (fig. 8) 50 . In relation to the disposition of Leonardo's Sala delle Asse , one now only needs make the further observation that Cesariano's pro- spettiva of this nature-derived artifact is physically distant and strictly external; quite to the contrary, Leonardo's viewpoint is decidedly «internalized». Leonardo literally places us within his arboreal pseudo-architecture, and, by so doing, he allows us to look from within-to-outside his cleverly simulated Urbau. Particularly as we lift our wondering eyes up- wards, we then see through its interwoven, pointed canopy, a pre-architectural structure erected and made by, as Vitruvius had put it, the fundamental means of «fureis et virgulis parietes texerunt». Given this wide variety of contextual evidence, we may now set about to reconstruct the most likely overall symbolic meanings of Leonardo's illusionis- 87</page><page sequence="13">tic, arboreal-architectural and quintessentially «natural», structure in the Sala delle Asse. In the most obvious sense, it represents a pictorial ekphrasis of the famous passage in De architectura, II, 1 ff., de- scribing the «natural» primitive hut, from whence all subsequent architecture sprang. In another sense, in 1498 Leonardo's ingenious ensemble most likely also represents a post-medieval commentary upon the pointed-arch, tedesco style of architecture51. As has been shown, on the one hand, «German architecture» had been described by «Raffaello» as having its tra- ditional origins in the ancient practise of tying together the branches of living trees whereas, on the other, Cesariano employed certain principles which he had extrapolated, secundum germanicam symme- triam, from the Cathedral of Milan in order to illus- trate Vitruvius' canonic prescriptions for «perfect buildings», those embodying the all-important prin- ciples of «proper arrangement» (fig. 11). At the same time, Ludovico il Moro, who certainly must have had a hand in the ideation of the Sala delle Asse, was then engaged in two vastly important building projects: the Milanese Cathedral and the Ducal residence in Vigevano. Although to modern eyes these two struc- tures look vastly different - «Classic» vs. «Gothic» - nevertheless, we have seen how, at least to con- temporary eyes, both shared a common and decided- ly «natural» basis: Vitruvianism. In the light of all this, it is fitting that Ludovico s personal emblem (fig. 2) should have been placed, «tiburio- like», at the very center and apex of the bota- nical vaulting of Leonardo's Sala delle Asse . This striking concetto of Vitruvian historicism « in more germanico , is most fittingly situated on the lowest floor of the Castello Sforzesco. As we can now easily imagine, Ludovico il Moro, the flattered patron of Leonardo's subtle artistic statement, must have then seen himself as an instrumental figure in a con- tinuing story first told by Vitruvius. His own place in this historical sequence was then being concretely ex- emplified by his active participation, as architectural patron, in the building projects of both the Cathedral of Milan and the Piazza Ducale in Vigevano. As has also been shown here, Vitruvius had specifically em- ployed the topos of the arboreal primitive hut as an all-inclusive symbol of the beginnings of human en- deavor, representing as it were the «ground floor» of all future progress, one literally below a piano nobile . From such rude but necessary beginnings, mod- ern men could proudly trace their inevitable passage upwards from the leafy bough-house, an indispens- able first step leading directly to ceteras artes et disci- plinas. All this future achievement is however post- ulated upon a still-faltering initial architectural ex- periment, an ambitious project which was, according to Vitruvius, as yet associated with lower forms: «a rude and barbarous mode of life». With the invalu- able lessons learned from this initial, inferior and primitivist, architectural exercise, exactly conform- ing however to the operations of Nature herself, only then can mankind advance, rising eventually (grada - tim progressi) to the final, fully evolved stage of «civi- lization and refinement». At that highest level, finally men are permitted the supreme insight into what Vitruvius called those «higher ideas, born of the mul- tiplication of the arts». To conclude, as is unquestion- able, under the munificent reign of the Sforzas in Milan, indeed «the arts were multiplied» 52 .

The original function of the suite that includes the Sala delle Asse is still not known although, as has been suggested by some modern scholars, it was most likely designed as a private retreat for Ludovico il Moro: see A.M. Brizio, Leonardo the Painter, in L. Reti (ed.), The Unknown Leonardo, New York 1974, 32-42; M. Kemp, Leonardo da Vinci: The Marvellous Works of Nature and Man, Cambridge MA 1981, 181. For my statements which immediately follow, dealing with certain rudimentary and medieval «triangulation» methods applicable to the architectural design of the Sala delle Asse, see J. S. Ackerman, «'Ars sine seien tia nihil est': Gothic Theory of Architecture at the Cathedral of Milan», Art Bulletin, XXXI (1949), 84-108. As Acker- man neatly sums up the situation (p. 105), «the Gothic approach [to proportions] is what might be called abstract, and is compara- tively unconcerned with [organic] proportions. Here the height and breadth of a particular element are determined only by a sim- ple mathematical relationship to the whole scheme». For the post- medieval approach, see the classic study by R. Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, New York 1971, succinctly observing (p. 159) how «the medieval artist tends to project a pre-established geometrical norm into his imagery, while the Renaissance artist tends to extract a metrical norm from the natural phenomena that surround him». However, as Wittkower further remarks (p. 45), «proportions recommended by Alberti [for whom, see notes 18 ff. below] are the simple relations of one to one, one to two, one to three, two to three, three to four, etc., which are the elements of musical harmony and which Alberti found in classical buildings». This situation, common knowledge, is pointed out here to illustrate further one the continuing themes of this paper, namely the co-existence of certain theoretical con- cepts common to both Late Gothic and Early Renaissance architectural practise. 2 Beltrami, 1902, 20. 3 Beltrami, 1902, 66. The basic wall-system comprises eighteen trunks, of which only eight rise to touch the Sforza crest at the apex; for a useful schematic diagram of the ceiling decorations, see Kemp, 1981, 185, fig. 44.

A more credible explanation of the rope-motif, at least on the «occasionale» level of interpretation, is the suggestion of Kemp, 1981, 186: «We may therefore suspect that the entwining of the Sala delle Asse branches was also intended to commemorate the union between the Milanese Duke and the d'E- ste princess», Beatrice who died in 1497, a year before Leonardo's work in the Sala. Kemp also mentions another context for the mo- tif (see note 25 below), which is the one to which I give priority for the idea, meaning that the Sforza-d'Este linkage was superimpo- sed upon a much older, indeed «timeless» proto-architectural idea. 11 V.

After I had finished the first draft of this paper (June 1987), it was kindly pointed out to me (by Prof. André Corboz) that attention has since been called, albeit only in passing, to Leonardo's paraphrase of Vitruvius in the Sala delle Asse; see A. Chastel, Les problèmes de l'architecture de Léonard dans le cadre de ses théories scientifiques, in Léonard da Vinci, ingénieur et architecte (exh. cat.), Montreal: Museum of Fine Arts 1987, 193-05. Chastel's brief reference to Vit- ruvius, pointing out none of the wider significance of the arbor- motif, reads as follows: «l'extraordinaire 'composition' de la Sala delle Asse [...], ce décoir d'architecture 'naturelle', illustre la proc- lamation du Moro comme duc en 1495 avec un appareil embléma- tique approprié [...] en fonction du motif de l'arbre - une des im- prese du Moro - y sont en effet incorporés mais en exaltant, en déployant le concept d'architecture 'naturelle' tiré de Vitruve (II, 1), expérimenté par Bramante au cloître de Saint-Ambroise et par Léonard dans des exercises graphiques dont on a la trace au folio 864r/315 r-a du Codex Atlanticus». As I have since found, another author - Kemp 1981, 188 - has made this connection to the Vitruvian topos, adding that the «common source» of Bramante's tree-columns and Leonados pergola «was no doubt Alberti» (spe- cifically De re aed., IX, I), and that «this visual pun on nature and architecture is utterly characteristic of Leonardo's tastes». Alas, this is all that Chastel and Kemp had to say about a provocative topic embracing all those, much wider, art historical implications that are treated here in so much greater detail (e. g., Bramante et al., as in n. 28 below). If one omits the specifically architectural references in Vitruvius' long statement, some details - especially the general tenor - of the Roman's historical tableau seem to echo (perhaps even were derived from) an earlier work. As we read in Lucretius (De rerum natura, V, 925-1457), «The human beings that inhabit those fields were far tougher than are the men of today, as that suited the offspring of tough earth. [...] They were relatively insensitive to heat and cold [and] lived out their lives in the fashion of wild beasts [and] did not know as yet how to enlist the aid of fire [and only] lived in thickets and hillside caves and forests. [...] But, as time went by, men began to build huts and to use skins and fire. [...] The agent by which fire was first brought down to earth and made available to mortal man was lightning. [...] All the arts were taught gradually, by usage and by the active mind's experience, as men groped their way forward, step by step». As we learn from Lucretius, he and Vitruvius were both merely repeating a kind of conventional wisdom about the rise of mankind, evidently long since established in Greco-Roman historiography. In the light of this, it is again interesting to note how the historical tableaux of Vitruvius and Lucretius have their close, but surely unintentional counterparts in ancient Dravidic literature. As one reads in the Vayu Paruna (VIII, 74 ff.), «Men next constructed houses, and, as formerly there were trees formed like houses, so did they now begin to erect [likewise] their houses, after repreated consideration. Some boughs are spread out, others are bent down, others rise upwards, while others again stretch horizontally. After examining thus by reflection how the different boughs of trees branch out, they constructed in a like manner the apartments of their houses» (in Lovejoy-Boas, 1935, 429). 26 See Rykwert, 1972. 27 M.A. Laugier, Essai sur I' architecture, Paris 1755, 9-10. At that particular time, Laugier was certainly not unique in sharing such sentiments concerning the literally «botanical» roots of architecture; for example, according to the fanciful-nationalistic notions of F.W. J. Schelling, «Die Architektur hat vorzugweise den Pflantzenorganismus zum Vorbild. [...] Beim ersten Anfang der Zivilization in der Bauart, vorzüglich der Tempel, die Deuts- chen das alte Vorbild ihrer Walder nachgeahmt haben, dass auf diese Weise die gotische Baukunst in Deutschland ursprünglich heimisch war, und von da aus sich vorzüglich nach Holland und England verpflantzte» (in D. Weiss [ed.], Schellings Werke, Berlin 1907, III, 232-233). For the historical, proto-Romantic context of such observations, see A.O. Lovejoy, «The First Gothic Revival and the Return to Nature», Modern Language Notes, XXVII (1932), 414- 446. 28 For illustrations of these «tree-columns», see Rykwert 1972, 98- 99, showing, besides Bramante's examples in Milan (for which, see also O.H. Förster, Bramante, Vienna 1956, 128), the «tree-arch» in Ulm Cathedral, a «tree-vult» in Bechnyé Castle in Bohemia, and a «tree-column» from Philibert 's architectural treatise, a work obviously beholden to Vitruvius' arboreal precedent; see Philibert De L'Orme, Le Premier Tome de l' Architecture, Paris 1567, 217, pa- raphrasing Alberti 's explanation of the motif (as in n. 20 above; an important citation, curiously not mentioned in Rykwert's compre- hensive study). For Philibert 's motif, see also J. Baltrušaitis, Im- aginäre Realitäten: Fiktion und Illusion als produktive Kraft, Col- ogne 1984, 105, and, for Bramante's tree-column, Gaus 1971, 61 (n. 49), who makes the following provocative (and quite accurate) sug- gestion: «Denkbar ist, dass Bramante zur Ursprungs theorie der Säule über die vitruvianische Urhüttenbescribung gelangte» (emph- asis mine). 29 J.R.

LXX, «De Vulcano», fol. 93 (emphasis mine): «[...] ut in libro de architectura Vitruuius uidetur afferere dicens: homines ue- teri more in syluis &amp; speluncis &amp; nemoribus nascebant [...] alii de frondibus facere tecta: alii speluncas fodere sub montibus: nonulli hyrundiunum nidos: &amp; aedificationes earum imitantes de luto &amp; uirgultis facere loca quae subirurent: haec Vitruuius». 36 Francesco Di Giorgios close paraphrase of Vitruvius' descrip- tion of the erection of the primordial primitive hut reads as fol- lows: «Onde possi manifestamente affirmare per alquanto spazio di tempo inanzi li omini già erano simplici e nel abitare quasi se assimilavano alii bruti. Posso adonque pigliare per vero principio che antiquamente già li omini abitavano per le spelunche e per le capanne con poco maggiore comodità che li bruti, secondo che tra li altri Vetruvio ancora ne scrive. E cominciando a fare abitazioni di legname e canne intexti [intrecciati], coperti di luto overo bitu- mine, in quelle abitavano. Di poi più espertamente procedendo in edificare. [...] Dopo questo, per le ragioni che nel proemio dissi, li omini prudenti furono costretti di edificare uno tempio [etc.].» C. Maltese (ed.), Francesco di Giorgio Martini: Trattati di architettura, ingegneria e arte militare, Milan 1967, II, 373-74; for his illustration of a primitivizing «tree trunk-column» (as in n. 28 above), see I, tav. 25 (unfortunately not discussed in Francesco's text; unfortuna- tely, neither is his textual description of the «capanna [fatta] di legname e canne intrecciati» illustrated here). 37 On this report, see J. Schlosser, La letteratura artistica: Manua- le delle fonti della storia dell'arte moderna, Florence 1967, 197-200. 38 For a thorough discussion of the problems of the authorship and dating of this memorandum, see E.

Their architectural subject was identified by Beltrami, 1902, 27; on p. 16, he depicts a cross-section of the tower housing the Sala delle Asse. 42 Wittkower, 1974, 85. The memorandum has been specifically re- lated to the «Sala delle Asse» by another scholar, who granted that it «was very probably current in Leonardo's time in Milan», and therefore, «I have little doubt that some recollection of this [memorandum] was in his mind at the time and contributed to the choice of design [in the 'Sala delle Asse']»: C. Gould, Leonardo: The Artist and the Non- Artist, Boston 1975, 100-101. 43 Wittkower, 1974, 85. 44 Wittkower, 1974, 25. 45 W.

Cesariano (ed.), Di Lucio Vitruvio Pollione de architectura libri decern traducti in vulgare Affigurati: Commentati: et con Mirando Ordine insigniti, Como 1521. According to Wittkower, 1971, 14, «it is through the 1521 edition of Vitruvius by Cesariano that we be- come acquainted with ideas current in the Milan of Bramante and Leonardo». 48 Vitruvius, 1960, 13-14; Vitruvius, 1962, 25-27. 49 Wittkower, 1974, 25. Ackerman, 1949, 100, observed what he called «the anthropomorphic, almost Vitruvian, «terms» of certain statements issued by the design committee of the Milan Duomo, beginning as early as 1400, and cites their statement about then- proposed plans for the Tiburio, to be executed, as he puts it, «according to the demands of geometry», namely, «pro rectifican- do praedictam ecclesiam et croxeriam ['Tiburio'] quod respondent ad quadrangulum», etc. 50 The title on Cesariano's print described this view as being: «Ex prima mvndi hominvm aetate aedificatio». As is vigorously affirmed in Rykwert, 1972, 104-6, «the source of all the later spe- culations about the primitive hut was Vitruvius on the origins of architecture». Rykwert, 1972, 105, also reproduces a print from Riff's Vitruvius Teutsch (1548), neatly demonstrating the pictorial diffusion of the Vitruvian archetypal-arboreal Urbau into the Ger- manic north. 51 Besides Wittkower, 1974, for the wider context of Renaissance evaluations of Gothic architecture, see E.S. Beer, «Gothic: Origin and Diffusion of the Term. The Idea of Style in Architecture», Jour- nal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XI (1948), 143-62; R. Bernheimer, «Gothic Survival and Revival in Bologna», Art Bulle- tin, XXXVI (1954), 270-79; E.

Moffatt (now finishing a dissertation on Sforza building schemes in Vigevano); Dr. Lubomír Konečný, Czechoslovakian Insti- tute of the Sciences, Prague. 90</page></plain_text>
