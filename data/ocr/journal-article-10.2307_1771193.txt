<plain_text><page sequence="1">GRAHAM LAW "I1 s'agissait peut- etre d'un roman policier": Leblanc, Macdonald, and Robbe-Grillet N THIS PAPER I wish to return to the question of the relationship between the popular genre of the detective story and one strand of what has come to be known as Post-Modernist fiction. Such an inquiry inevitably engages us with wider cultural and narrative issues, in par- ticular the dichotomy between "popular" and "serious" cultural modes and products, and the role of popular fictional forms in either reinforcing or subverting the narrative mode of Realism, which remains dominant despite the overt questioning of its assumptions which characterizes the Modernist project. Here, following Catherine Belsey, we can briefly classify those assumptions as: the illusion of depth, the commitment to narrative closure, and the organization of distinct textual voices into a hierarchy of discourses (Belsey 70-72.) This configuration is clearly if complexly related to a specific (bourgeois) ideological formation, which is also instrumental in generating the cultural discrimination between the "popular" and the "serious." In this context, I wish to focus special attention on a related series of oppositional metaphors which have considerable power in organizing not only the narratives themselves (both "popular" and "serious") but also critical attention to them: surface and depth; mechanical and organic; inside and outside. Recent critical attention to these questions includes work by Michael Holquist, David I. Grossvogel, Stephen Heath, and Stefano Tani, among others.' These writings vary considerably in terms of focus, Other writings significant here include Kermode, Hartman, Charney, and Spanos. 335</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE theoretical position, and conclusions. I shall return briefly to the latter three later and here restrict my attention to Holquist's paper. In his relatively brief article, Holquist attempts to demonstrate that "what the philosophical presuppositions of myth and depth psychology were to Modernism . . the detective story is to Post-Modernism" (135). Within "Post-Modernism" he treats Borges, Nabokov, and, in particu- lar, Robbe-Grillet; by "the detective story" he indicates "the tale of pure puzzle, pure ratiocination, associated with Poe, Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie" (139). Holquist sees the relationship in Post-Moder- nism's subversion of the conventional expectations generated by the popular form, in the defeat of the "syllogistic order . .. the mechanical certainty, the hyper-logic of the classical detective story" (155). Engag- ing also with the wider issues of the relationship between "kitsch" and the "avant-garde," the argument cuts many corners, and a large number of problems emerge. First, the assumption of a total break between the Modern and the Post-Modern and the consequent characterization of Modernism as the "attempt to fill the void of the world with rediscovered mythical symbols" with an attendant metaphysics of depth remains unsupported and unconvincing.2 Secondly, the unexplained use of the term "metaphysical detective story" to describe the work of, among others, Robbe-Grillet seems in danger of reintroducing a similar metaphysics of depth into narrative forms which are elsewhere rigor- ously distinguished from those of Modernism, especially since Holquist accedes to the use of the same term to describe the work of Chesterton. Thirdly, and perhaps most pervasively, the article lends a markedly different order of attention to the popular forms from that accorded to "Post-Modernist" narratives. This is evidenced most clearly by the elisions and factual errors which mark Holquist's discussion of the detective story.3 Nevertheless, his discussion does raise a number of central problems that my own essay attempts to address, and the third problem men- tioned above helps to explain the strategy employed here. Without, I hope, losing sight of the wider questions involved, I will organize the argument around close attention to three specific novels: Maurice Le- blanc's Les dents du tigre; The Three Roads by Ross Macdonald (pseudonym 2 Though clear differences (such as the nature of the relationship to popular narrative forms) do emerge between what I would prefer to call "high" and "late" Modernism, I would argue that the postulation of a complete epistemological "break" is far from justified. In particular, the emphasis on the radical novelty of the "Post-Modern" tends to produce an over-simplified and reductive account of earlier Modernist writing, as Holquist's essay illustrates. For a more extensive presentation of this position, cf. Gabriel Josipovici, "Keeping Up with the Post-Moderns." 3 The most glaring error is Holquist's assertion that Chandler was writing "hard-boiled" stories before Hammett (146.) 336</page><page sequence="3">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET of Kenneth Millar); and Alain Robbe-Grillet's first published novel, Les gommes. The first two are normally assigned to the popular genre, and illustrate structurally different varieties within the detective story which Todorov has analyzed as the "roman ' ~nigme" and the "roman noir." I will attempt to accord them the kind of attention given to Robbe-Grillet's novel, which is normally assigned to "serious" fiction but is clearly related to the procedures of the detective story. The classical (ratiocinative) detective story is characterized by enigma and retrospection, stimulating curiosity concerning past events and, as Todorov argues, tending towards "une architecture purement g6ometrique" (57). The movement of the narrative is from enigma (disorder of events) to solution (true order of events), separated by an insistent delay in the revelation of information. This superordination of the mechanics of action also implies the subordination of such novelis- tic concepts as character and setting which tend towards a purely formal status. The narrative generates two stories, the story of the drama and the story of the inquiry, which are rigorously separated and hier- archized, the hero of the (subordinate) drama being the criminal and the hero of the (superordinate) inquiry being the detective. Within the classical form, we can recognize two different strands, which can be distinguished both structurally and, to a large extent, historically. The principal structural difference concerns the nature of the delay between enigma and solution. A variety of narrative strategies is employed to fill this gap, of which the most prominent are the descrip- tion of investigative procedures and the presentation of a false solution, which often, though by no means always, suggests a supernatural order- ing, thus underlining the origins of the classical form in the Gothic romance. Up until around the beginning of the First World War the classical detective short story, best represented by the work of Poe, Doyle, and Chesterton, generally involves only either a single movement from disorder to order or limited complexity in the form of a single false solution generated by either the incompetence of other investigators (usually the police) or the fear of the supernatural. Later, the short story loses its dominance and is superseded by the detective novel; this increase in the duration of the narrative is one factor in producing the modulation from the "standard" ratiocinative story described above to the more complex structures of the "ingenious" or "game-playing" variety. A further factor is the extent to which, during this earlier period, due largely to the popular success of the Sherlock Holmes stories, the form solidifies into a recognizable genre with established conventions and expectations. As a result, both the criminal in the story and the reader of the story become more self-conscious in their 337</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE roles, and the narrative becomes overtly a game or competition between reader and writer, criminal and detective.4 Greater narrative complexity is thus introduced in the form of the "frame," that is, a false order prepared in advance by the criminal, who is by now familiar with investigative procedures, in order to lead the investigator astray, and/or the proliferation of false solutions, producing a Chinese-box structure of solutions within solutions. Although the false orders generated finally prove to derive from conscious human agency, the initial gesture is frequently to suppose a mechanism beyond the agency of the single subject, again sometimes suggesting the intrusion of supernatural forces. Most notably in the novels of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen, the structure of the detec- tive story often reproduces a familiar cultural pattern, in the form of myth (normally classical or Christian), game, ordering system (the letters of the alphabet, for example), or nursery rhyme. For example, in Christie's Ten Little Niggers (published in the U.S. as And Then There Were None), the series of murders conforms to the pattern of a nursery rhyme, while in Queen's Ten Days' Wonder, the action consists of a systematic breaking of the Ten Commandments, culminating in "Thou shalt not kill." The false order produced thus frequently invokes an overt intertextuality, that is, the re-enactment of the structure or words of a pre-existing text. The detective drama is then often literally theat- rical. The theatrical setting offers not only a closed community with a clearly established ritual, a tight timetable, and ample opportunity for disguise and mistaken identity, but also a text to be followed. Queen's The Roman Hat Mystery and Christie's Lord Edgeware Dies are among the first to exploit the possibilities; Ngaio Marsh perhaps makes most con- sistent use of the theatrical context; and the more "academic" detective story writers, such as Michael Innes, develop the literary textual aspects. If in the narrative closure this intertextual order invariably emerges as a design, a production of the well-read master criminal, this does not entirely erase the questioning of the origin of narrative order raised in the deferment of the "true" solution. And in the process, both the invincibility of the detective and the distinction between the drama and the inquiry may be undermined, since the detective's role may also be assigned in the criminal "production." In extreme cases, such as Anthony Berkeley's The Poisoned Chocolates Case or Cameron McCabe's 4 As a brief illustration of this point we might note the essays written during this period by Ronald Knox and S.S. Van Dine, which emphasize strongly the ludic elements of the detective story; or Ellery Queen's practice in his first ten novels of inserting a "Challenge to the Reader" before the close of the narrative, indicating that all the clues have now been presented and that the reader should attempt to arrive at a solution before reading on. 338</page><page sequence="5">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor, there is no end to the series of Chinese boxes and the narrative closure is permanently deferred. If Leblanc's Les dents du tigre finally resists such indeterminacy, it may nevertheless serve as a representative example of the "ingenious" detective story.5 Leblanc's early "Arsene Lupin" novels combine the influence of the classical detective story instanced by the Holmes series with the crim- ninal-hero stories, most notably Hornung's "Raffles" tales. In Leblanc's later stories, among them Les dents du tigre, however, Lupin becomes more respectable, more like the classical amateur detective, although something of the ambiguity of his role remains, an element which engages with the features of the "ingenious" detective story noted above. In Les dents du tigre, under the brief anagrammatic disguise of Don Luis Perenna, Ars6ne Lupin acts as both amateur detective and potential police suspect in a series of mysterious deaths, initially those of Lupin's friend Cosmo Mornington, a police inspector, and the engineer Hippo- lyte Fauville and his son. What seems at first to be a series of un- connected fortuitous events proves to be a causal chain when all the major personages involved are shown to be potential beneficiaries of the Mornington will. The narrative proceeds principally by means of a series of false solutions in each of which the apparent murderer of the previous solution is shown to be "framed" by a further suspect. Initially, the bereaved wife and mother, Mme Fauville, is shown by a seemingly unbreakable chain of evidence to be the murderer. Later, however, Lupin shows that Mme Fauville is "la victime de ... la plus diabolique des machinations" (225), and points the finger of suspicion at a further lost relative of Mornington's, Gaston Sauverand. Sauverand and Mme Fauville are then revealed to be lovers, and the victims of a frame by Fauville himself who has committed suicide in a manner planned to cast guilt on them. Fauville's actions are then in turn shown to be directed at a higher level by another, Mlle Levasseur, with whom Lupin has developed a romantic attachment. Finally, Mlle Levasseur is shown to be the pawn in the hands of the supreme plotter, the morally and physically deformed Jean Vernocq, who, though shown to have directed almost the entire action, appears himself only at the end of the story. At each stage it is significant that Lupin acts as both the initial police suspect and the principal provider of the evidence against the alternative suspect. The terms "machination" and "direction" are of central importance here. As regards the first, the text continually plays on the embedded 5 For a more extended discussion of what I have termed the "ingenious" variety of the classical detective story and its relation to late Modernist narrative, see my "Ellery Queen and Jorge Luis Borges." 339</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE meaning of "machine." Throughout, when each suspect is revealed to be patient not agent, played upon not player, "l'exactitude m6canique" (371) of the plot gives rise to the fear of an absence of human agency, of action due not to "intervention humaine" but "la rigueur stupide d'une loi physique" (327). This is particularly apparent in the plot against Mme Fauville and Sauverand, where a series of letters arriving at meticulously exact intervals and seemingly without human agency helps to provide the material evidence: La sortie de Mme Fauville le soir du crime... machination! L'impossibilit6 oui elle se trouve de donner l'emploi de son temps pendant que le crime s'ex6cutait... machina- tion! . . . Je vous le dis, tout est machine d'avance, tout est prepare, dose, 6tiquet6, num6rot&amp;. Chaque 6v6nement prend sa place t l'heure prescrite. Rien n'est laiss6 au hasard. C'est une oeuvre d'ajustage m6ticuleux, digne du plus habile ouvrier, si solide que les choses ext6rieures n'ont pu la d6r6gler, et que toute la m6canique a fonctionn6 jusqu'aI ce jour, exactement, pr6cis6ment, imperturbablement ... (324-25) This gothic frisson of an order beyond the human is dispelled when Lupin demonstrates that the engineer Fauville has precisely manufac- tured the evidence, and in particular has designed in advance a chronological mechanism that will "deliver" the letters at pre-planned intervals after his death. If in this case the theatrical setting is not literally operative, and the ordering of events is intratextual (generated by repeated patterns within the text) rather than intertextual, the con- tinual play on the word "direction" allows the theatrical device to operate at the metaphorical level. In explaining the plot at each stage, Lupin demonstrates to the suspect that "Il y a un autre etre derriere vous, au-dessus de vous. Et c'est lui qui vous dirige"(381), constantly reverting to theatrical metaphors. When Mme Fauville is sent out to the theatre by her husband on the night of his death, it is Fauville himself who arranges "une scene de mensonges" for the spectators, who directs "la com6die, la trag6die plut6t" (334). And Fauville himself is later shown to be one of "les acteurs inconscients du drame dont... [Vernocq] a nou6 et dont il denoue les fils"(363). This metaphor in turn gives rise to the image of Vernocq as puppet-master, manipulating at a distance the strings which order the action. If at each stage, and once and for all in the narrative closure, the operation of the "machine" is shown by the detective to be the design of a "volont6 directrice" (348), this does not entirely remove the ques- tioning of the origins of the narrative order. A number of narrative disturbances remain, particularly with regard to the role of the master criminal Vernocq and the master detective Lupin. As often in the classical detective story, the clarity of the solution cannot quite match the opacity of the presentation of the mystery. The ending is often more 340</page><page sequence="7">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET a frustration of the process of suspense than its culmination. The su- preme plotter Vernocq does not appear in person until close to the end of the narrative. He is then presented as weak and deformed, almost incapable of action on his own account, in violent contradiction to the vital will and energy necessary, it has been constantly insisted, to direct the action. And in attempting to explain the motivation for this vast and intricate plot, the text reverts to the previously discarded suggestion of "diabolism." These disturbing absences with regard to the finally revealed master criminal mean that the concept of a deus ex machina manipulating the action retains much of its force. In addition, Lupin's role retains its ambiguity even to the end when he marries Mlle Levasseur and retires from public life. As we have seen, the domain of the drama and the domain of the inquiry are continually confused since Lupin's role constantly incurs the suspicion of both police and reader because of his Protean power to generate alternative explanations of events, his own role as potential beneficiary of the Mornington will, and his relationship to Mlle Levasseur. In the final duel between crim- inal and detective, Lupin himself is described both as the author of "machinations infernales" (473) which trap Vernocq and the puppet- master who finally pulls the strings to bring him back to justice. This dialectical play within the series chance-order-plot characteristic of the "ingenious" detective story, while formally acknowledging the importance of the motivation and intentions of a character within the story, points less towards the illusion of depth than towards an acknow- ledgement of the "volont6 directrice" of an author outside the story. As Dorothy L. Sayers argues, in the roman einigme "the plot must occur as planned . . . the future is fixed, and the characters must conform to it ... with the author's deliberate intention" (11). If, as has been noted, the classical detective story frequently echoes the mechanisms of Greek tragedy,6 it is to the omnipotent author rather than the Gods that the appeal to external power is made. And of course this authorial bid for a totalitarian power, which manifests itself in the desire to stand outside, above the action, and retrospectively to render the world of the novel entirely transparent, is itself not unambiguous, but simultaneously con- ceals and reveals a significant psychological and ideological vulnerabil- ity.7 Unlike the roman ' 6nigme, the roman noir is characterized by suspense and prospection, stimulating curiosity concerning less what has hap- pened than what will happen and why. Thus, as Todorov argues, "le roman noir moderne s'est constitu6 non autour d'un proc6d6 de pr6sen- tation mais autour du milieu repr6sent6, autour de personnages et de 6 Cf especially Jacques Barzun and Hartman. 7 This statement concerning the ideological function of the "roman a inigme" obviously 341</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE moeurs particuliers; autrement dit, sa caract6ristique constitutive est dans ses thames" (60-61). The mechanics of mystery do not entirely disappear, but are subordinated to the investigation of the depths which are revealed beneath the surface of events. In the roman ' 6nigme the occurrence of crime is in marked contrast to the apparent innocence of the setting and the personnages, seem most clearly in the Edenic ambience of the country-house detective story (see Auden); in the roman noir, crime emanates directly from the corrupt environment and charac- ters presented. Here the drama and the investigation normally occur simultaneously and are not rigorously distinguished from one another. The detective cannot remain entirely outside the events which take place, and must partake to a greater or lesser extent in the general corruption. The distinction between the roman a 6nigme and the roman noir is both structural and historical. The roman noir originates in the United States in the period after the First World War, in part at least as a reaction against the ludic and mechanical aspects of the classical form and its perceived inability to engage with the realities of crime in a world of prohibition, depression, and gangsterism. Raymond Chand- ler's essay "The Simple Art of Murder" presents the argument in a parularly clear way, opposing the artificiality, superficiality, and mechanicalness of the roman a 6nigme with the authenticity, depth, and organic nature of the new mode. "Reality" and "life" are the terms repeatedly invoked to support the opposition. Suggesting that the fun- damental problem lies in the subordination of character to action, Chandler attacks the roman ' 6nigme as "utterly unreal and mechanical fiction" (225), manipulating "puppets and cardboard lovers and papier- mach6 villains" (232), devoid of "the authentic flavor of life as it is lived" (231). The counter-claims for a "realistic mystery fiction" are illustrated by the case of Dashiell Hammett who "gave murder back to the kind of people who commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse... He put these people down on paper as they are, and he made them talk with the language they customarily used for these purposes" (234). Although the roman noir often presents an overt social radicalism remains schematic, but is supported by the complex and persuasive structural and sociological analysis of the form by Moretti. Briefly, he argues that the classical detective story (paradigmatically represented by the Sherlock Holmes stories) operates in the transition from the individualistic ethic of liberal bourgeois ideology to the mass culture concomitant with "the sui generis totalitarianism of contemporary capitalism" (155). Thus the dominant cultural opposition of the detective story, between the individual and the society as organism, is resolved in favor of the latter, representing "the totalitarian aspiration towards a transparent society" (136). 342</page><page sequence="9">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET in its thematic development, while the roman a 6nigme may present an overt conservatism (we remember that, in order to buy time from the authorities towards the end of Les dents du tigre, Lupin offers a fully fledged North African colony to the State), as Chandler's argument suggests, the assumptions of the roman noir provide a closer fit with those of the Realist project than do the games of the classical detective story.8 As Todorov recognizes, such a thoroughgoing commitment to a metaphysics of depth suggests a (conservative) breaching of the cul- tural norms dividing "popular" and "serious" fiction, a going beyond the limits of genre (65).9 Julian Symons's history of the detective story, Bloody Murder, illustrates this position with great clarity since it is or- ganized not according to genre sub-classifications such as those offered by Todorov, but explicitly according to the value judgement that "the detective story had changed into the crime novel" (183). This use of the term "novel" implies a bridging of the cultural divide, suggesting that such works are at the same time "serious" psychological novels which happen to deal with the origins of crime, and extensions of the popular genre. Symons includes the works of Ross Macdonald in this group. Of course, considerable variety remains possible within the roman noir framework, particularly as regards the nature of the origins of crime. At the risk of over-generalization, among the most noted writers Hammett tends towards delineating political, Chandler sociological, and Macdonald psychological origins. Macdonald consistently makes use of a (Freudian) psychoanalytic model in assigning causes. It has frequently been noted that there are significant parallels between the investigative methods of the classical fictional detective and the Freu- dian psychoanalytic project;'" the classical detective story has been analyzed in psychoanalytic terms more than once;" and in a number of romans a 6nigme-for example, Queen's Ten Days' Wonder- psychoanalytic concepts are formally employed in assigning criminal 8 The argument may be contrasted with those of Heath (34) and Belsey(109-13), who suggest that the classical detective story can be seen simply as a paradigm of the Realist text. 9 In addition, we might note here Chandler's complaints that his work is unreasonably excluded from the level of attention accorded to "serious literature." Cf, for example, the letters to James Sandoe (Jan 26 1944) and Hillary Waugh (Oct 1955), reprinted in Dorothy Gardiner and Katherine. Sorley Walker's Raymond Chandler Speaking (48, 62), and Ross Macdonald's comments on the work of Hammett: "Hammett was the first American writer to use the detective-story for the purposes of a major novelist, to present a vision, blazing if disenchanted, of our lives" (182). 10 Among the most significant writers on this question are: Elliot L. Gilbert (especially 289-90), Steven Marcus, Gabriel Josipovici ("Meyer Schapiro's Mousetrap"), and Carlo Ginzburg. See also Graham Law, "Reading the Signs: Analysis and Narrative in Poe, Doyle, and Freud." 11 Cf. in particular Geraldine Pederson-Krag and Charles Rycroft. 343</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE motivation. But Macdonald is perhaps one of the first to exploit this recognized parallel in fiction in an explicit and systematic way. In part as a result, Macdonald's novels reveal a more marked interest in what has already happened, in a scene primitive, an earlier family drama which gives rise to later criminal events, than is usual in the roman noir. The bridging of the gap between drama and inquiry, the engagement of the detective in the action, can partly be understood in terms of the Freudian concept of "transference." We could trace this development through many of Macdonald's later novels in which the detective Lew Archer acts as both analyst and surrogate father to disturbed youth, but here I wish to focus attention on one of the earlier "end of the war" novels, The Three Roads, in which, as the title and the epigraph suggest, the Oedipal parallel is most overt. In The Three Roads, the investigation is simultaneously detective and psychoanalytical. The novel opens in a military hospital where the protagonist, naval lieutenant Bret Taylor, has been undergoing almost a year's psychiatric treatment concerning his self-induced loss of mem- ory following two traumatic incidents at the end of the war: the loss of his ship and his discovery on returning to the United States of his murdered wife's body. Both the criminal event and the psychic processes that have caused Taylor's illness remain enigmatic at this stage. Two professional analysts are involved in the case, the moralistic Captain Wright and the Freudian Dr. Klifter, a Jewish escapee from a Nazi concentration camp, whose conflicting procedures are outlined in some detail. In addition, Paula West, Taylor's former fiancee, faithful despite his sudden and disastrous war-time marriage, acts as a sort of lay analyst, intimately involved in the case, trying to help Taylor to recover his sanity. When a decision is finally made to inform Taylor directly of the hitherto repressed fact of his wife's murder, the novel enters the suspense mode of detective fiction, as Taylor decides that the solution to all the problems lies in discovering the identity of his wife's murderer. Both before and during this detective phase, the focus of attention repeatedly goes back to Taylor's past, his childhood experiences with a puritanical father and a licentious mother, his problematic sexual relations with both Paula and his wife, and his war-time experiences. The psychoanalytical drama seems to reach a climax when we learn that Taylor suffers from psychosomatic feelings of guilt originating in the supposed death of his mother, revived traumatically by the later wartime events. However, in the course of the novel, after finally tracing two of his wife's lovers and eliminating them as suspects, and after the revelation that his mother is in fact still alive, Taylor discovers that he himself is the murderer, a fact already known to, but supressed by, 344</page><page sequence="11">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET Paula West. Thus the detective drama is superimposed on the displaced Oedipal pattern of the Freudian family drama. The detective discovers his own guilt, and drama and inquiry thus form a closed circle. Though the family and personal dramas are the center of attention, they unfold within the carefully detailed historical and social context of immediately post-war coastal California and against the backdrop of a wider world convulsed by fascism and war. When Paula takes the train for Los Angeles, she is struck by the marked contrast between the Santa Fe railway station and the San Diego gas company building, the "symbols of historic forces" (14), representing plutocracy and state power respectively. The novel touches on contemporary social questions such as the psychological and social problems of returning servicemen, refugees and racism, the psychoanalytic revolution in America, the tension between professionalism and "Kitchen and Kinder" in the social role of women. Nevertheless, the stance throughout remains indi- vidualist, broadly liberal humanist, consistently appealing to an organic relationship between the individual and the environment, so that the anthropomorphism that Robbe-Grillet was to attack shortly afterwards in "Nature, humanisme, tragedie" appears consistently in such phrases as "an unsmiling sky" (Macdonald 15). The appeal to a metaphysics of depth emerges repeatedly in such metaphors as: "The motives that explained his life were as difficult to trace as a river that ran under- ground" (34). And although the novel is written in the third person, the narrative mode, unlike that of the classical detective story, generally tends towards internalization, an interior monologue attached particu- larly but not exclusively to the consciousnesses of Taylor and West. Although this limited perspective and the transition between centers of consciousness frequently result in delayed recognitions on the part of the reader also, the final gesture is to weave together these threads of internal thought, providing an external position for the reader from which everything can be understood. Of course an overt intertextuality does emerge in the correspondences with Sophocles's Oedipus Rex and Freud's reading of it. The novel is studded with allusions to Freud's writings and more casual references to the Oedipus and other classical myths. On closer inspection, however, it is clear that the organizing principle is not a previous writing, but what is seen to underlie it, a universal pattern of human experience seen as myth rather than text, and thus there is little or no questioning of the origins of narrative order, or the status of the narrative. The Gothic fear of the intrusion of extra-human forces does not enter here. However, the Freudian compulsion to repeat does give rise to a number of theatrical, or more precisely, film metaphors. Paula West is a script writer for a Hollywood studio and this "realist" detail infiltrates the 345</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE metaphoric code of the text. Near the opening of the narrative, Paula experiences a disturbing sense of d6ji vu: "It seemed to her that the afternoon was repeating itself. Her meeting with Bret had only been a rehearsal, and the set was being arranged for a final retake . . . Soon Bret would come out on the veranda, and he and she would read their lines again" (6). This metaphorical appeal recurs regularly throughout the narrative, until Taylor's final recognition of his role in the criminal drama: "The scene that flickered at the back of his mind was ... shadowy dark like an under-exposed film... He saw himself in the scene, small and foreshortened and faceless like an unknown actor whose movements have been recorded by an over-head camera" (163). If The Three Roads represents an assimilation of the detective novel towards the assumptions of Realism, and thus the tendency to erase its own discursive processes before an appeal to an illusion of depth, the partial engagement with the Freudian theory of representa- tion and the consistent investment in such filmic metaphors show that the process of representation itself cannot be entirely removed from view. The writing itself thus works both to conceal and reveal contradic- tions in the (here liberal humanist) ideological formation."1 A significant and by now generally recognized characteristic of late Modernist fiction is its engagement with popular narrative genres, par- ticularly but by no means exclusively the detective story. The names of Borges, Nabokov, Pynchon, Robbe-Grillet, Ollier, Butor, Cortizar, Sciascia, Spark, Eco, and Calvino are among the most prominent in this regard, although their relationships to the popular forms remain varied.13 When Robbe-Grillet attempts to characterize his own fictional writings in the early theoretical essays collected in Pour un nouveau roman it is to the model of the detective story that he turns: Les pieces a conviction du drame policier nous donnent, paradoxalement, une assez juste image de cette situation. Les 616ments recueillis par les inspecteurs--objet abandonn6 12 Again this statement remains schematic but is supported by the extensive structural and sociological analysis of the roman noir by Jerry Palmer. Briefly, Palmer argues that the dominant procedure of the form is the opposition of a competitive isolated hero and a pathological conspiracy. The ideological function of the form is thus to (fictitiously) resolve the contradiction between individuality and sociality in liberal culture in favor of individuality. The principal problem with Palmer's analysis is its very extensiveness. In refusing to recognize sub-genre categories and in arguing for the inclusivity of the genre of the thriller, Palmer's structural analysis conflates significant distinctions not only between the "positive" thriller (represented by Spillane and Fleming) and the "negative" thriller (represented by Hammett, Chandler, Macdonald, and Le Carr6) but also between the roman noir and the roman ' 6nigme. I would argue that Palmer's sociological analysis thus applies to the roman noir but not to the roman A 6nigme, which is more accurately analyzed by Moretti. 13 The most comprehensive analysis of this engagement is Stefano Tani's study of the relationship between Italian and American "Postmodernist" fiction and the detective 346</page><page sequence="13">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET sur les lieux de crime, mouvement fix6 sur une photographie, phrase entendue par un t6moin-semblent surtout, d'abord, appeler une explication, n'exister qu'en fonction de leur r1le dans une affaire qui les d6passe.

It is important first of all to underline the extent to which Robbe-Grillet's argument is conducted on the level of opposition, an openly declared opposition to what we have termed Realism, but which is here called "le roman bourgeois" and associated above all with the work of Balzac. The attack is insistently on "les vieux mythes de la 'profondeur"' (22); in place of the world of the Balzacian novel, founded on the appeal to a "real" world both prior to and underlying the fiction, and thus trans- parent and full of meaning, Robbe-Grillet proposes a fictional world that is solid, material, superficial, stubbornly resistant to meaning. If this argument and the quotation above seem to point towards a "chosiste" position that is merely the inversion of the Balzacian project and consequently retains the dualist framework,14 we may also consider the extent to which Robbe-Grillet's early essays instance a sliding be- tween different and contradictory theoretical positions. Stephen Heath's analysis provides us with a succinct formulation of this aspect. Heath demonstrates effectively that the various early theoretical writings allow "the schematic postulation of three Robbe- Grillets": a "chosiste" Robbe-Grillet, committed to the presentation of a neutral world of things from which human meanings have been erased; an extreme subjectivist Robbe-Grillet, where the fiction comes to rep- resent "the screen of the mind of the central perceiving character"; and a third Robbe-Grillet, where, in effect, the previous two, both based on a model of representation, are played off against each other, generat- ing a concern with the process of representation itself, with fiction as story. However, like Holquist's study cited earlier, Tani's argument postulates a complete break between the Modern and the "Postmodern." In addition, like Holquist and Grossvogel, Tani tends to neglect the extent to which the "ingenious" version of the classical detective story works against the idea of simple narrative closure, and con- sequently overestimates both the novelty and the significance of the rejection of "solution" at the plot level in the "Postmodern" version of the detective story. 14 The theoretical problems involved in this suggested inversion of the Balzacian assump- tions are outlined succinctly by Roland Barthes. 347</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE "the milieu of the production of meanings" (67-70). And, as Heath argues, it is this third term which is most suggestive with regard to Robbe-Grillet's fictional practice. Reading this formulation back into the passage concerning detective-story evidence, we can see, in the margins of the assertion of the mere presence of things, a similar in- terplay between the anxious desires of the investigators and the resis- tance of the evidence. A similar process can be seen in Les gommes, where Robbe-Grillet perhaps works closest to the detective story model, in what might be termed a nouveau roman policier.'5 There the interplay, at least in part, takes the form of juxtaposing without synthesis the two detective story modes we have described above, the roman ~enigme and the roman noir. A special agent sent from "the capital" arrives in an isolated provin- cial town in order to investigate the supposed death of Daniel Dupont. The detective nature of Les gommes manifests itself early in the narrative. The enigma is concrete, criminal. The scene of the crime yields its quantity of familiar clues: a gun, footprints, a cut telephone wire, finger- prints, and an unfinished sentence of script. Detective, victim, and assassin seem to take up their familiar roles. Drama and inquiry seem divided by the usual antiseptic space. The inquiry is the principle of organization. This familiarity is of course only partial and temporary. The roles become displaced, the goal of the inquiry begins to recede, gaps proliferate. But in this play of familiarity and unfamiliarity the forms of the detective story continue to remain a point of reference. In addition to the special agent, Wallas, the role of inquirer is dissemi- nated across a range of personages and groups, both professional and lay. Throughout there operates the opposition of two official investiga- tive bodies: the local conventional police (Commissioner Laurent and his subordinates) and the quasi-official, central government agencies (to which networks Wallas is tenuously connected). These competing organizations provide two incompatible frameworks for an explanation of the events that have taken place at Dupont's residence. The local solution operates in terms of a particular, unique set of events, a function of individual motive and opportunity, a projection of underlying human intention. The central solution operates in terms of a repeated pattern, a reproducible mechanism, a function of an anonymous conspiracy, whose model is elsewhere. No hierarchical principle emerges to adjudi- cate between the two contradictory explanations. Wallas's vulnerability is in part a consequence of the instability of this interplay between internal and external frames. Wallas's progressive loss of control is repeatedly presented in terms 15 This phrase is borrowed from the title of the article by Hanna Charney already referred to. 348</page><page sequence="15">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET of metaphors of inside and outside. Being an outsider generates both the insecurity of unfamiliar perspective and the security of detached vision. Yet this dualism too is disturbed: Wallas's relation to the central agencies is doubtful, and the central agencies are themselves divided. He is deprived of vital information concerning the crime and the agen- cies' actions. His position is probationary, under threat. As a result Wallas fulfills his role with none of the natural confidence of the trad- itional detective, but constantly fails in his attempt to imitate an as- signed role without the security of inside knowledge. However, this does not prevent him from being distrusted by the local police because of his relation to the central agencies. Similarly, the independence of Wallas "vis-a-vis du lieu et de l'heure" (45) as he wanders around the city, in contrast to the regimented behavior of the local inhabitants, provokes not so much respect as suspicion in the wider community. And Wallas's initial project of mapping the bifurcations of this unknown territory is frustrated not only by the opposition of the inhabitants, but by the resistance of the ambiguous topography of the city itself. If it emerges that the territory is not totally unfamiliar, that Wallas is rather less than a complete outsider, the half-memories of his childhood visit serve to hinder rather than to help the quest, by confusing the object of the journeying. Thus the tension between personal and professional anxieties extends beyond minor physical irritants (such as swollen feet experienced during the course of the investigation) to encompass more disturbing and potentially Oedipal memories and desires. This disturbance of the security of the inquirer's role becomes radical when the domain of the drama begins to infiltrate the domain of the inquiry. The suspicion directed towards Wallas is not only general but also specifically concerned with his possible involvement in the criminal drama itself. And the hypotheses receive a form of displaced confirma- tion when Wallas finally shoots Dupont. As Wallas progressively loses control of the investigation, another order begins to emerge in which the investigator is not agent but patient, not controller but controlled. The transition from detective to unwilling assassin is a gradual process in which coincidence and doubling, both of which suggest a controlling mechanism above the intentions of an individual subject, play an impor- tant part. (I shall return to this process shortly.) If only on the level of plotting, we must distinguish this denouement from those of Oedipus Rex and The Three Roads, where the investigator uncovers his own role as wrongdoer in a drama that has already taken place. In Les gommes, by contrast, Wallas's inquiry at the same time reveals and constructs a future order in which he himself is radically implicated, but without appeal to a higher-order reality (such as fate, psychological universals, or authorial control). And here, in addition, the interference of drama 349</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE or authorial control). And here, in addition, the interference of drama and inquiry also involves the breakdown of the division between story and discourse. At this point we must consider the way in which the role offered to the reader is also that of vulnerable inquirer. This role is a function of the radical discontinuity of the text. Parallel to a proliferation of formally declared breaks, the text presents an insistent sliding between two discursive modes. One we might call formally unattached. This discourse is "objective," that is, oriented towards the description of physical (predominantly inanimate) objects. Such description promotes the ostensible over the functional, emphasiz- ing mechanism, symmetry, reproducibility, internal geometric order, delaying or problematizing causality and human significance. Obvious examples of this mode would be the descriptions of the mechanism of the swing-bridge and the section of tomato. The other mode might be termed formally attached. This discourse is "subjective," that is, oriented towards the cognitive processes of a human subject. This orien- tation promotes the functional over the ostensible, tending towards style indirect libre, emphasizing causal order and human intention. Examples would be the numerous hypotheses of Laurent and Wallas, in particular, concerning the events at Dupont's residence. But what is most signifi- cant is the absence of a clear principle of subordination between these discourses, and the consistent sliding between the two modes, which precludes a simple dualism and the tendency to allow the two to stand as alternative modes of extra-discursive representation. This sliding is prepared for by the opening of the narrative where the description of the patron of the cafe preparing for the day's business modulates into style indirect libre. The initial description stresses the internal coherence of mechanical action: "De tris anciennes lois reglent le detail de ses gestes, sauves pour une fois du flottement des intentions humaines." But: "Bient6t malheureusement le temps ne sera plus le maitre. Envelopp6s de leur cerne d'erreur et de doute, les evenements de cette journee, si minimes qu'ils puissent etre, vont dans quelques instants commencer leur besogne, entamer progressivement l'ordon- nance ideale" (11). The reverse movement can also be seen, for example at the beginning of the second chapter, where "Bona," the head of the anarchist organization, awaits the arrival of his agent Garinati, and the narrative mode changes from a lengthy meditation in style indirect libre on Garinati's inadequacies to the ostensible description of "Bona" and the room. As a result, described objects develop an enigmatic, resistant quality, while the actors in the drama are often reified, indi- cated merely by their professional role or by recurrent metonymic traits. This interplay between "unattached" and "attached" modes creates problems for the reader in ordering and assigning status to narrative 350</page><page sequence="17">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET statements. The narrative rejects the confident linearity of suspense fiction and produces in turn the effects of what we might term "prema- ture ordering" and "delayed decoding."''6 For example, unattached over- views, as in the phrase "Cet homme s'appelle Garinati ... C'est ... lui l'assassin maladroit de la veille, qui n'a fait que blesser lgigrement Daniel Dupont" (20) deflate the process of suspense associated with the detective story; at the same time, the use of style indirect libre in conjunction with frequent narrative breaks often causes considerable delays in even minimally assigning the subject and the context. Lengthy deferral begins to shade into a more radical indeterminacy, where not only the subject and the context (both spatial and temporal), but also the narrative status is called into question. Since the narrative present tense infiltrates all sequences of events, the reader is persistently made to assign the labels "narrative present," "flashback," or "hypothesis" to sections of narrative not formally distinguished. Any such distribution remains, however, fraught with conjecture, and the disruption created begins to engender a distrust as to the origin and status of all narrative statements. "Flashback" becomes contaminated with "fantasy," as in the scene where Wallas enters a cafe and meditates on his first contact with "le grand Fabius," head of the special agency (164-65). And "hypothesis" becomes a form of "flashforward" or "retour en avant," as, most notably, when the earlier suspicions concerning Wallas's role are later confirmed in his shooting of Dupont. The deferral of narrative order thus moves towards permanency. Narrative coherence is further undermined by the way the reader encounters an insistent doubling of apparently discrete elements in the discourse. This process is apparent on the levels of both plot and lan- guage. Physical objects (the guns of Wallas, Dupont, and Garinati; the spectacles of Dr. Juard, "Andre VS," and Dupont), persons ("Andre VS" and Wallas, Daniel Dupont and Albert Dupont), and events (the visits ofJuard and Marchat to Laurent's office, the shooting of Professor Dupont) are repeated with minor variations. In addition, previously encountered fragments of narrative, description, and dialogue continu- ally resurface later on.17 This doubling of both plot and text is best 16 Using Hume's distinction between the ostensible and functional, we may suggest that "premature ordering" subordinates the ostensible to the functional, preempting the conventional process of the reader's coming to understand a narrative event, and deflating the process of suspense, while "delayed decoding" subordinates the functional to the ostensible, significantly deferring the conventional process of the reader's coming to understand, and generating an enigma over and above that of the "who done it" of the detective story. The insistent sliding between these two devices in Robbe-Grillet's narra- tive necessarily disrupts the dualism of Hume's model. The term "delayed decoding" is borrowed from Ian Watt, who coined it to describe an Impressionist device in Conrad's fiction. 17 Again this effect emerges throughout the novel, but the phrase "Vous ne lisez pas 351</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE seen as an interference between metaphoric and metonymic ordering. That is, patterns emerging in the metaphorical coding of the text serve to disrupt rather than complement causal ordering of narrative events. At this point we can begin to understand how the notion of intertex- tuality operates in Les gommes. It is not necessary again to rehearse the catalogue of textual allusions to Sophocles's Oedipus Rex that can emerge from close readings of Robbe-Grillet's novel. The studies of Bruce Mor- rissette, David I. Grossvogel, and Ann Jefferson, among others, have already emphasized this aspect adequately.'8 The function of the al- lusions, however, requires some clarification. Firstly, the references engage with Sophocles's text rather than with the myth in any non-dis- cursive form. And secondly, the fit between the Oedipal and the detec- tive story structures remains irreducibly asymmetrical. It seems then unjustified to devalue the disruptions of the metonymic ordering of the narrative, as Morrissette and Grossvogel do in varying ways, in order to privilege a metaphoric patterning which allows the emergence of a prior, extra-discursive meaning, whether in mythical or Freudian form. The occurrence of the allusions in the form of mise en abyme, that is, precisely the interference of metaphoric and metonymic orderings, in- dicates that this valorization is indefensible. Jefferson's comment is valuable in this regard: Instead of developing the thematic potential of the paralleling of Wallas and Oedipus, the text instead seems to emphasize the theatrical elements of the Oedipal situation in which Wallas finds himself in his memory. He remembers a scene, where he played a central role, speaking to characters outside a building which might itself be a theatre. The Oedipal allusions have the function not of pointing to a meaning, but of drawing attention to the drama as a means of representation (22). The pattern of theatrical allusions ("scene," "personnage," "la.lumiere s'allume," "decor," "acteur" emerge in the first two sections of the les journaux?" illustrates well the diverse contexts in which this can occur: within a particular scene; in the fragmentary repetition of a particular scene; and in two or more otherwise different scenes. In the interview between "Bona" and Garinati (102-05), the dialogue is broken into a number of textual blocks and seems constantly to turn back on itself, an impression which solidifies when the question "Vous ne lisez pas les jour- naux?" is finally repeated and the scene is broken just as it seems to begin again. The phrase recurs (218) when the text dissolves (as on a number of other occasions) into a series of small fragments concerning Garinati's second (?) visit to Dupont's house. While it might be possible to justify the narrative coherence of these recurrences by inferring the confused subjectivity of Garinati, this recuperation is clearly impossible when the phrase resurfaces in the exchanges between Wallas and Mme Bax (111) and the railway employees in the automatic restaurant (162). 18 See Morrissette 37-75, Grossvogel 165-79, and Jefferson 18-30. The analyses of both Morressette and Grossvogel are made from the point of view of Robbe-Grillet as "subjec- tive realist," in Heath's terminology, and discuss the intertextual references in order to construct a "metaphysics of depth" in the narrative, from a psychological and a phenomenological perspective respectively. 352</page><page sequence="19">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET prologue alone) encountered in Les gommes is as insistent as the echoes of Oedipus Rex, and not infrequently the two come together. In one passage concerning Garinati's assassination attempt following the scenario laid down by "Bona," the theatrical, textual metaphors are explicitly linked with the themes of machinery and reproducibility which we have already encountered: La machinerie, parfaitement r6glke, ne peut r6server la moindre surprise. Il ne s'agit que de suivre le texte, en recitant phrase apres phrase, et la parole s'accomplira ... Dans ce d6cor fix6 par la loi, sans un pouce de terre ' droit ni ' gauche, sans une seconde de battement, sans repos, sans regard en arriire, l'acteur brusquement s'arrete, au milieu d'une phrase... II le sait par coeur, ce r6le qu'il tient chaque soir; mais aujourd'hui il refuse d'aller plus loin. Autour de lui les autres personnages se figent, le bras levi ou la jambe a demi fl6chie. La mesure entamee par les musiciens s'6ternise ... II faudrait faire quelque chose maintenant, prononcer des paroles quelconques, des mots qui n'appartien- draient pas au livret ... Mais, comme chaque soir, la phrase commenc6e s'acheve, dans la forme prescrite, le bras retombe, la jambe termine son geste. Dans la fosse, I'orchestre joue toujours avec le mime entrain. (23-24) Such instants of uncertainty and vulnerability are consistently generated by Robbe-Grillet's narrative. Like the actions of Garinati and Wallas, the writing and reading of Les gommes constantly hesitates between an ordering founded on doubtful human intentions and the security of a pre-determined pattern. In this process what emerges is neither a rep- resentation of human subjectivity nor a neutral presentation of the otherness of objects, but in the mutual interference of the two, a repeated discovery of the act of representation. In Les gommes drama and inquiry, inside and outside, are inextricably confused. Both "ancient laws" of a pre-established metaphoric order and the metonymic order which the agents of the "Law" attempt to discover undermine each other, so that the reader experiences not the security of knowledge briefly defer- red, but a disturbing and potentially liberating readjustment of a con- ventional understanding of the "laws" of narrative possibility, and, through that, of the recounting and reading of experience outside the text. I hope that this analysis will have demonstrated at least that it is only possible to understand the engagement of late Modernist fiction with popular narrative forms if we are prepared to give a serious order of attention to the narrative complexities and possibilities of those forms. It is important to recognize the potential and actualized ambiguities in the relationship between both distinct varieties and specific narratives within the detective story and the Realist model of representation if we are to grasp the genre's importance for writers such as Robbe-Grillet. If late Modernist fiction constitutes a further challenge to the domi- nance of the Realist project through the (this time) overt rejection of its 353</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE unwritten assumptions of transparency, depth, and organic unity, at the same time such fiction provokes a re-reading and re-writing of the cultural mapping which draws the frontier between the "popular" and the "serious." It would seem possible to differentiate between the "popular" and the "serious" on three distinct levels. Firstly, we can distinguish socio- economically between different modes of production and consumption. If we note the importance of marketing, advertising, and packaging in the mass consumption of popular fiction, we must at the same time note the importance of the higher education establishment in generating and regulating demand in the luxury market of serious fiction. Secondly, we can distinguish on formal grounds, as Todorov does most clearly (56), between two aesthetic norms, with popular fiction conforming to the conventions and expectations of recognized genres, while serious fiction rejects the concept of genre itself. Finally, we can distinguish according to criteria of cultural "value," perhaps opposing "escape" and "encounter," or "formula" and "mimesis." Two problems emerge here. One is that, while we may note particular connections between these distinct levels of analysis, for example the relation between genre and packaging, there has been a marked tendency to slide imperceptibly from one level to another. The most telling instance of this is the way in which the opposition of "popular" and "serious" itself elides the distinctions between "serious" and "trivial" (level of value) and "elite" and "popular" (socio-economic level). The other related problem is that the criteria of cultural value are themselves often not explicitly formulated, and tend to conform to the undeclared assumptions of the Realist model.19 An important case in point here is the work of John Cawelti in Adventure, Mystery, and Romance, a well-informed and in many ways admirable attempt to direct attention to popular narrative genres as of aesthetic as well as sociological interest (see especially 13-20). In order to avoid the elitist assumptions of the division between "popular" and "serious," Cawelti suggests instead a distinction between the "for- mulaic" and the "mimetic," characterized by differing degrees of faith- fulness to "the representation of reality." This conservative formulation forces the analysis to work only inside the dualism of "surface" and "depth," "mechanical" and "organic," and allows little possibility of the questioning of the assumptions of Realism within either mode. What I am emphatically not suggesting is a total rejection of the act of discrimination, the shelving of the question of cultural value, although this is a position towards which both Marshall McLuhan and Leslie Fiedler have moved in discussing the divide between "popular" and '9 Stuart Laing points out both problems. Cf especially 223-31. 354</page><page sequence="21">LEBLANC, MACDONALD, ROBBE-GRILLET "serious."20 As I hope the above analysis has demonstrated, discrimina- tions are maintained this time not on the basis of conformity or discon- formity with the Realist model but rather concerning the extent to which narratives engage with questions about the mode of representation itself, since it is in part through this process that the potential exists for trans- forming the cultural norms that help to determine the reading and writing of our lives outside the work of fiction. It would be disingenuous not to acknowledge that this engagement is encountered more consis- tently and more overtly in late modern fiction than in the popular examples. However, the danger here is of over-simplifying the psychological and cultural motivation behind late Modernist writing, of ignoring the crucial question of the vulnerability of the modern novelist, of taking the overt opposition to the Realist project, outlined for example in the theoretical statements of novelists such as Robbe- Grillet, as a guarantee of the total and conscious artistic control of the writer. To avoid this danger, it is necessary to go beyond the formal recognition of the plot-level strategies of late Modernist fiction such as narrative discontinuity, mise-en-abime, and meta-fictional devices, to the smaller-scale linguistic shifts and disturbances that accompany them, and crucially to the complex but specific social and psychological moti- vations which help to generate both. This is an aspect which the present study, with its wide cultural and historical perspective, has done little more than touch on; Allon White's The Uses ofObscurity, although attend- ing to the fiction of early Modernism, represents the type of study that I have in mind. At the same time it is important to recognize that the question of motivation is not entirely irrelevant to the study of popular fictional writings. (One should remember here that devices like discon- tinuity, mise-en-abime, and meta-fictionality are not in any case the ex- clusive preserve of avant-garde fiction, as many of the examples of the "game-playing" detective story, and in particular Cameron McCabe's The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor, amply illustrate. We may summarize in the words of Pierre Macherey: "En fait.. . il n'y a pas de livre innocent: la spontaneite apparent du livre facile, promis 'a une consom- mation immediate, suppose la mise en oeuvre de moyens 6prouves, empruntes souvent 'a la litterature la plus concert&amp;e, et trinsmis d'ceuvre en oeuvre par une tres secrete tradition.. .Mais ... s'il n'y a pas de livre tout 'a fait innocent, il n'y a pas non plus de livre tout 'a fait averti: conscient de la nature des moyens qu'il emploie pour etre livre, sachant ce qu'il fait" (38-39). These are important recognitions which are still 20 Cf especially the title essay in Fiedler's Cross the Border. This extreme position is articulated most clearly, and most damagingly, in his What was Literature?. 355</page><page sequence="22">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE blurred by the canonization of the "serious" and the marginalization of the "popular" in our cultural and educational institutions.
