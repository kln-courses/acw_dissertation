<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folkloric Resonances in Jean Giono's Un Roi sans divertissement Kathy Comfort (1 f one were to judge the novel by its title, Jean Giono's Un Roi sans divertissement À might be construed as a philosophical work because of its allusion to Pascal who, in Pensée 142, proposes "qu'on laisse un roi tout seul, sans aucune satisfaction des sens, sans aucun soin dans l'esprit, sans compagnie, penser à lui tout à loisir ; et l'on verra qu'un roi sans divertissement est un homme plein de misères" (1 14). The work, initially published in 1947, falls within the period critics refer to as the "second Giono," a phase in which the novelist considered more weighty and philosophical issues. At the same time, one finds in this second phase, particularly in Un Roi, echoes of the "premier Giono," characterized by its rich poetic language and pastoral setting. What makes the narration of Un Roi unique, even among Giono's other works, is that it alternates between such diverse forms as local legend, detective novel, and philosophical treatise. What is more, there is a constant shifting of narrative voices from that of the initial narrator, who recounts the incidents eighty years after they occurred, to those of the secondary narrators, who experienced the events firsthand, all of which adds to the novel's complexity. The novel's imagery is just as intricate as its narrative structure, for while Un Roi contains numerous allusions to literary masterworks such as Chrétien de Troyes's Perceval and Pascal's Pensées, allusions which today's reader is likely to recognize immediately, there are just as many references to folk tales and local legends which may go unnoticed on a perfunctory reading. In Once Upon a Time. On the Nature of Folk Tales, Max Lüthi writes that the local legend is "a report - sometimes quite formless and unpolished - of a weird, frightful event" (85), which accurately describes the episode on which Giono's narrative focuses. This was a conscious choice, for in his preparatory carnets, Giono wrote that the Chroniques were to be "aventures plus racontées qu'écrites," "des histoires racontées à haute voix" (quoted in R. Ricatte 1294). Strikingly, the structure and style of the traditional oral tale provides the inspiration for the primary narrator of Un Roi, because he constructs his story using superstitious belief, prevalent in rural communities well into the twentieth century, to strengthen the complicity he establishes with his audience. The integration of folklore into the novel permits today's reader to see the murders from the perspective of a rural community in mid-nineteenth- century France. Indeed, the combination of abundant folkloric images and the chilling incidents that make up the legend of M. V. leaves us with the impression of being transported to another world. The allusions to folklore, specifically the references to the legend of the werewolf, become the center of the narration, because in addition to providing local color, they offer us insight into the psyche of the serial killer M.V. and the gendarme Langlois. The basic plot of Un Roi is as follows: the initial narrator recounts the troubling events that took place in the winters of 1843, 1844, and 1845, which he pieces together some eighty years later from testimonials of those who experienced them. That first winter, several individuals from the region of Chiciliane disappear and a mutilated pig is discovered during a period of heavy snowfalls when the village is essentially cut off from the outside world. Langlois, the gendarme in whose district the hamlet is located, hypothesizes that the perpetrator's motive is to escape the stultifying boredom caused by the brutal winters. The following February, the disfigured bodies of the missing are found in an ancient beech tree and the killer is tracked to a neighboring town. Langlois meets in Dalhousie French Studies 66 (2004) -53-</page><page sequence="2">54 Kathy Comfort secret with the suspect, known to the reader only as M. V., and escorts him to a clearing in the forest. After a short discussion with the man (the subject of which is never revealed), the gendarme shoots him at point blank range in front of a small number of witnesses. Claiming that the shooting was an accident, Langlois resigns his commission, only to return a year later as the commandant de louveterie. He keeps his distance for the most part, his social contact limited to Saucisse, the café owner and former prostitute, and several of the community's more prominent citizens. That winter, a wolf decimates the sheep herds in the area and the commandant de louveterie organizes an elaborate and elegant wolf hunt that stirs the village. Once the wolf is cornered, Langlois savagely kills it in precisely the same manner in which he killed M. V. The viciousness of that act causes the local population to fear for the mental health of the commandant, so they attempt to find him an appropriate divertissement. Their efforts are in vain, for Langlois commits suicide by "smoking" a stick of dynamite, presumably to rid himself of the obsession with the beauty of blood on snow that pushed M. V. to commit the atrocious murders. Because much of Un Roi deals with the sadistic murders and the attempt to understand M. V.'s homicidal impulses, its similarity to a traditional detective novel is evident to even the most casual of readers. Although the novel's plot could easily be that of a work of detective fiction, Giono creates a hybrid of sorts by applying to a roman policier the structural and rhetorical conventions of a local legend. Overall, the reader has the impression of listening to a folk tale recounted by a traditional storyteller at an informal social gathering. Like any good storyteller, the primary narrator of Un Roi goes to great lengths to engage his listeners in the tale. This includes the standard references to locale and family ties, as well as to the folklore and traditions specific to the region, both of which are rhetorical devices that, according to Liithi, establish a link to the "personal milieu of the narrator and his listener" (85). The primary narrator of Un Roi offers us what little information exists about the killer's family; he does not know of any of M. V.'s relatives in the immediate vicinity of the town of Chichiliane, although "il y a des V. plus loin, si vous montez jusqu'au col de Menet" (10), and "si vous descendez sur le versant du Diois, eh bien, là il y a des V" (11). The narrator is also acquainted with an individual who shares the notorious murderer's family name and who exhibits what residents of the area consider extraordinary behavior; "il lit, il lisait Gérard de Nerval : Sylvie" (11). The assumption that character traits and even idiosyncratic conduct may be passed on from one generation to the next predates genetic science, since it has long been a part of ousta, the tradition in Languedoc according to which, Pierre Lamaison informs us, "on hérite... de la renommée bonne ou mauvaise de ses prédécesseurs, de leur honneur ou de leur déshonneur" (340). Thus it is not surprising that the memory of the murders nearly a century before is still fresh enough for the local population to seek out signs of unusual behavior in M. V.'s descendant. In effect, M. V.'s legacy consists of the anecdote of the homicides he committed and of the haunting fear that his relatives may one day succumb to the same pathology. The importance of family to the rural society in which the brutal murders take place is equally evident when the narrator situates the location of the murders with reference to a prominent clan's property: "Frédéric a la scierie sur la route d'Avers. Il y succède à son père, à son grand-père, à son arrière-grand-père, à tous les Frédéric" (9). Although this excerpt calls to mind a traditional folk tale, which often begins by establishing the background of the characters and their place within the community, the narration shows evidence of innovation since, as Jean-Alain Favre notes, "Giono se plaît à mettre en lumière les relations entre ces moments différents du temps ; il ne cesse d'insister sur les généalogies, afin de relier le passé et le présent" (108). Consequently, Frederic's genealogy, as well as that of Marie Chazottes, M. V.'s first victim, allows the fictional listeners, who are presumably residents of the region, to visualize the scene. For today's</page><page sequence="3">Giono 55 reader, this technique serves to engage us in the tale by transporting us to a rural society, one in which family ties are the threads of the social fabric. Another way that the narrator of Un Roi engages the listener / reader in his tale is by pointing out familiar sites in the village and region that date back to the time of M. V.'s murders, a technique borrowed from oral narratives. More than simply part of the landscape, these landmarks and the families associated with them continue to be a part of the community to which the primary narrator and his audience belong. In setting the scene, the narrator draws the reader's / listener's attention to the tree near Frederic's mill, pointing out that "il y a là un hêtre ; je suis persuadé qu'il n'en existe pas de plus beau : c'est l'Apollon-citharède des hêtres [...] Apollon exactement, c'est ce qu'on se dit dès qu'on le voit et c'est ce qu'on se redit inlassablement quand on le regarde" (9). The allusion to Apollo in this last excerpt calls to mind the Greek god's association with poetic inspiration, since the tree aids the narrator in his task of recreating the troubling episode. Gaston Bachelard observes that trees can trigger "l'imagination dynamique propice à la création littéraire" (232), and in Un Roi, the massive beech is the root of the story, the point of departure for the tale. In Western European tradition, moreover, trees are viewed as the sole remaining witnesses to long-ago events (Lehner 1 12) and, as Laura Rival notes, they have "embodied social memory in Europe for centuries" (19). On a very basic level, the tree described by Giono's narrator witnessed the crimes that took place in the village, since "en 1843-44-45, M. V. se servit beaucoup de ce hêtre" (10). Ominously alluding to the murders that M. V. committed during that three-year period, the narrator anthropomorphizes the beech tree, remarking that "le plus extraordinaire est qu'il puisse être si beau et si simple. Il est hors de doute qu'il se connaît et qu'il se juge. Comment tant de justice pourrait-elle être inconsciente?" (9). There is, then, a juxtaposition of the solidly rooted tree and M. V., who symbolizes death and becomes the uprooter of the community.1 Because the serial killer hides his gruesome handiwork in the tree, the beech's image is forever transformed from a symbol of life (Lehner 112) into an emblem of death in the minds of the villagers and their descendants. That the beech tree preserves the memory of its role in M. V.'s diabolical acts is not in itself surprising. What is more unusual is that the tree becomes the killer's surrogate, because the narrator attributes to it the feelings of remorse that the murderer never expresses. At the same time, the personification of the tree transports the reader / listener to a different reality, to the semi-mythical world that Langlois and M. V. inhabited. One finds this same rhetorical device in the description of the house in which M. V. lived. To the more perceptive observer, the dwelling displays human affect; it is "non seulement très solitaire mais, manifestement, à ses murs bombés, à son toit, à la façon dont les portes et les fenêtres sont cachées entre des arcs-boutants énormes, on voit bien qu'elle a peur" (1 1). To a certain extent, the beech tree and the house form the center of the murder mystery because they are both locations frequented by M. V., and also because they retain the emotional resonance of his acts. The beech tree "se connaît et se juge" because it held the remains of M.V.'s victims, making it an accomplice after the fact of the serial killer. The house had a passive role in the events since it simply provided shelter for M. V., yet it is presented as fearful, perhaps afraid that the local population might exact revenge on it for its previous owner's heinous crimes. Strikingly, the area around the structure is devoid of trees, and so the dwelling "ne peut pas se cacher que dans la terre et il est clair qu'elle le fait de toutes ses forces : la pâture derrière est plus haute que le toit" (11). Although there is no reminder of the vegetation associated with the homicides and no longer any place in which to hide the evidence of murder, M. V.'s property preserves the memory of his horrific crimes. 1 Luce Ricatte notes that the beech tree in linj&amp;i constitutes a "microcosme où vie et mort se confondent et se succèdent perpétuellement" (1307), thus underscoring the theme of sacrifice and death (1307).</page><page sequence="4">56 Kathy Comfort As is the case with many notorious criminals, M. V.'s profile consists of little more than the monstrous acts he committed and the geographical locations he frequented. However, the narrator of Un Roi provides the reader some insight into the murderer's state of mind through the use of folkloric allusions, the most prominent of which is that of the werewolf. The initial narrator complains that M.V.'s story is for the most part a "lost" legend because there are no documents pertaining to the killings in the local museum. The museum's curator explains that M. V.'s crimes are not included in the holdings since "on Ta considéré comme un malade, un fou" (13). Strangely, however, that same museum houses accounts of mythical wolves and werewolves sighted in the surrounding area, including "une importante iconographie. . . sur des loups-garous dont les différentes gueules sont portraiturées (il n'y manque pas une canine). . . . mais sur mon V. de 43 rien ; pas un mot" (13). This association between M. V. and the werewolves adds to the folkloric nature of the novel while emphasizing that the murderer is a man who is periodically controlled by primal instincts. It is important to note that psychiatrists today understand werewolves to be the folkloric interpretation of a form of compulsive behavior (Devlin 73), a psychological affliction that seems to trouble M. V.; in the course of the narration the serial killer emerges as the victim of an obsession that compels him to produce blood on the snow, the only divertissement that relieves his boredom. Although it may be tempting to dismiss the inclusion of the werewolf legend as merely an example of local color, as the narration unfolds, the reader comes to understand that the mythical creature is the emblem of M. V. As he begins to relate what he knows about the killer, the narrator complains that "on n'a pas pu me dire s'il était grand ou petit" (12). He does, however, come up with a rudimentary portrait based on the Nerval aficionado by the same name who may or may not be M. V.'s descendant. The primary narrator, weaving his story in the 1920s, hypothesizes that "celui de 1843... je le vois, moi, avec la barbe.... Grand? Mon Dieu, il aurait pu être petit, à condition d'être râblé ; mais certainement d'une très grande force physique" (12). The speculation in this last passage, that the killer was hirsute, takes us back to the images of werewolves in the local museum. M. V.'s supposed strength is likewise an attribute of that mythical creature. What is more, the nebulous physical description underscores the fact that this could be any individual, since there is no visible indicator to distinguish M. V. from the rest of the population. The historian at the regional museum touches on the likelihood that the murderer was an outwardly "normal" man, observing, "on n'est jamais sûr qu'à un moment ou à un autre on ne sera pas poussé à quelque extravagance" (13), which the reader comes to realize is the novel's principal message. The fact that the killer was "un homme comme tous les autres" reminds us that monsters may roam unnoticed among us, a message often conveyed by regional folklore. The reflection on the incomprehensibility of human behavior that is the focus of Un Roi has been treated by philosophers since time immemorial. Giono gives the theme new life by presenting it within the context of a local legend; the folkloric characteristics he brings to the work renders his message all the more powerful. The ominous, supernatural atmosphere of the first part of Giono' s novel, along with the narrator's kinship to the traditional storyteller, gives us the impression of entering a world made distant by the passage of time and by the disturbing events that occurred there. The initial narrator of Un Roi is cognizant that his listeners, like the residents of Chichiliane at the time of the murders, may interpret the murders as the acts of a mythical creature such as a werewolf rather than those of an ordinary man. In beginning his story, he cautions that "cette histoire n'est pas celle d'un homme qui buvait, suçait ou mangeait le sang." Nor are the killings the work of the devil: "C'était beaucoup plus inquiétant" (20). Later, when M. V. escapes into the fog, the narrator repeats his admonition: "II n'y a là ni mystère, ni truc pour vous faire entendre à mots couverts que nous avons affaire à un dieu, un demi-dieu</page><page sequence="5">Giono 57 ou un quart de dieu" (22-23). Again, we are to understand that these are the actions of an ordinary man, someone who could be a neighbor or a friend. When we do finally "see" M. V., at the base of the tree in which the victims' remains are found, we are not presented with a monster. Instead, we are told by Frédéric II, who catches sight of him near the beech tree, that there is something not right in M. V.'s otherwise unexceptional comportment. The villager describes "[un] homme dénaturé adossé contre le tronc du hêtre dans une attitude fort paisible, même abandonnée; dans une sorte de contentement manifeste" (33). The juxtaposition of the commonplace and the extraordinary in this excerpt is especially striking in that M. V. is described as "dénaturé," yet calm, contemplating the tree in which he left the mutilated bodies.2 It is precisely this contrast between the ordinariness of the man and the unspeakable nature of his acts that provokes a reaction of horror in the listener / reader, a contrast that one frequently finds in folktales. After following M. V. several miles through the snow, Frédéric II recalls seeing the man enter his home in Chichiliane, where "sur le seuil, il a dénoué de son cou un cache-nez très humain" (75). This ordinary act demonstrates that despite the grisly evidence to the contrary, the perpetrator was unremarkable. The addition of the qualifier "humain," moreover, provides farther grounding in reality. By all accounts, then, the murderer is outwardly "normal" to onlookers, or at least his mental instability is not discernable to those with whom he comes into contact. The ordinariness of M. V.'s appearance belies the beast lurking beneath the surface, which inevitably calls to mind the werewolf legend introduced at the very beginning of the novel. Anne Antoine-Machu sees the word dénaturé that Frédéric II uses to describe M. V. as a crucial qualifier, positing that "ce qui le fait nommé tel est sa nature dédoublée par quoi cohabitent en lui l'homme et le loup, comme en son ménage la biche et le loup- garou" (18-19). Like the individual who during a full moon becomes a werewolf, this is an average man who metamorphoses into a monster as the result of a change in atmospheric conditions. Whereas for the werewolf it is the lunar phase that triggers the transformation, for M. V. it is the boredom brought on by the heavy snowfall. Folk belief in Southern France holds that the werewolf "ne sort que pendant les longues nuits, par un temps affreux et obscur : particulièrement entre Noël et Chandeleur" (Piniès 145), a period falling one month after Epiphany which is precisely the moment when M. V. strikes.3 What little we know about the killer's psychological state is obtained through the description of his ghastly acts. When Langlois arrives to investigate the missing persons cases, he has little physical evidence to guide him, which necessitates his "getting inside" the killer's head. The gendarme becomes obsessed by the question of how M. V., "un homme comme les autres" (58), becomes a multiple murderer. Like his counterparts in traditional detective novels, the narrator of Un Roi speculates as to the perpetrator's motive. One particularly relevatory incident is the discovery of the mutilated pig at the site of an attempted kidnapping, when the murderer managed to elude capture. His violent attack on the pig is an attempt to replicate the pleasure he derives from killing humans, the assumption being that brutalizing a farm animal is less evil than murdering his fellow man. Because the homicides begin again shortly after, one can assume that the porcine mutilation was not an adequate divertissement. This incident, recounted by an 2 Interestingly, the tree itself acts as a divertissement for M.V. because its association with the murders triggers a visual memory of the pleasure the blood on snow provides him. Luce Ricatte points out that the blood and the tree are "de longues trouées hors du tunnel, des échappées qui donnent une impression de plénitude dans l'attente de l'autre plus importante que l'acte même" (1323). 3 It is worth noting that this is a period close to the pagan holidays of the winter solstice, which marks the death of the old year and the birth of the new. The timing of the murders prompts Jeanne Bern to view M.V. as a king whose function is to "(recréer" through human sacrifice (62). However, Bern's hypothesis does not take into account the fact that there is no rebirth associated with the murders.</page><page sequence="6">58 Kathy Comfort individual who had seen the crime scene first hand, is puzzling because "on n'avait pas essayé [d'égorger le cochon], ce qu'on aurait pu comprendre. On l'avait entaillé de partout, de plus de cent entailles qui avaient dû être faites avec un couteau tranchant comme un rasoir. . . On les voyait faites avec plaisir" (22). The obvious sadism of the act causes the narrator to exclaim, "'Ça alors, c'était incompréhensible.' Tellement incompréhensible, tellement écœurant (Ravanel frottait la bête avec de la neige et, sur la peau un instant nettoyée, on voyait le suintement du sang réapparaître et dessiner comme les lettres d'un langage barbare, inconnu)" (22). What stands out in this last excerpt is that the stab wounds on the pig constitute a code, albeit one incomprehensible to all but the perpetrator. In effect, the gesture is so atrocious that one cannot believe a fellow human being would be capable of it. We are, however, given a clue as to the meaning of the physiological message in Giono's reference to Pascal. According to Pensée 142, a lack of divertissement leads to misery. In the context of Un Roi, we are to understand that the murders, which at first glance appear to be the result of a lust for blood, are in fact an attempt to escape the misery caused by boredom. One of the most intriguing aspects of Un Roi is the fact that the divertissment M. V. uses to relieve his boredom is transmitted to Langlois. As his involvement in the investigation deepens, the gendarme begins to acquire the serial killer's thought processes, which renders him susceptible to the obsession with blood. While obviously an important step in a criminal investigation, his very understanding of the killer means that he appropriates the thought processes that generate the murderous instinct. He conjectures that the murderer admires the beauty of the blood (49), which is a corollary to the hypothesis that he kills "pour le plaisir" (27). He further posits that each of the victims was chosen for "la qualité du sang, le vif, le feu" (48), which evoke the ancient belief that blood carries one's life force. More importantly, this comprehension of the murderer's deeds is an example of the folkloric resonances in the novel. In fact, the corruption of Langlois's psyche by M. V.'s homicidal thoughts is evocative of the myth of the werewolf. Legend in Auvergne has it that one is a werewolf either by birth or by infection (Piniès 144). Because Langlois shows no sign of pathology before taking on the missing persons case, we are led to believe that tracking M. V. psychologically "contaminates" him with the sanguineous fascination. These are both "hommes comme les autres" as well as victims to the extent that they are unable to curb their obsession with blood. Initially, Langlois himself is baffled by the killer's motive; the question of whv nags him at the beginning of his investigation: "Ce qu'il me faudrait savoir ... c'est pourquoi on les tue et pourquoi on les emporte" (44). In one of the gendarme's discussions with Saucisse, the café owner, about the disappearances, the policeman confides that "il me semble qu'il n'y a pas de raison pour nous mais il y a une raison pour lui. Et, s'il y a une raison pour lui, nous devons pouvoir la comprendre. Je ne crois pas, moi, qu'un homme puisse être différent des autres hommes au point d'avoir des raisons totalement incompréhensibles. Il n'y a pas d'étrangers" (158-59). Langlois's reflections on the killer's motive provide a counterpoint to the folkloric nature of the novel as a whole, an injection of a more contemporary point of view into what reads for the most part like a local legend. The gendarme's transformation into a werewolf becomes more evident after the discovery of the bodies, at which point the narrator tells us that "Langlois était tiré plus violemment par le vivant que par le mort" (78), because the police captain insists on going at once to confront M. V. On the one hand, we may surmise that he is more concerned about new victims than about those beyond help. On the other, we may see Langlois's urgency as a "symptom" of his own murderous infection. After a lengthy interview alone with M. V., Langlois takes him to the forest, where he executes him with "deux coups de pistolet dans le ventre, des deux mains, en même temps" (86). The vigilante execution is recounted years after the fact by an eye-witness who was standing a</page><page sequence="7">Giono 59 good distance away, so we have no inkling about the psychological state of the executioner or the executed. We do, however, have the reaction of those who witnessed M. V.'s killing at Langlois' s hands. The bystanders were shocked not only because there was no trial or confession, but also because the disciplined gendarme carried out the execution in such a brutal manner. The reader surmises that Langlois, too, has become a monster. However, the gendarme's metamorphosis is not as abrupt as the above quote might lead us to believe. Rather, Langlois' s transformation occurs gradually and is conveyed to the reader by the recollection of his actions by his contemporaries. One incident in particular proves to be critical in establishing the link between the police captain, the serial murderer and the legend of the werewolf. Langlois reappears in the village a year after M. V.'s execution, as commandant de louveterie, whose function is to "détruire les 'nuisibles'," and to "protéger les 'utiles'" (104), which is not entirely different from the duties of a gendarme. That winter, a wolf brings fear once again to the village and, as the narrator recalls, "on ne pouvait pas oublier tout de suite ces temps où nous avions été, pour ainsi dire, comme des moutons dans les claies pour M. V." (1 14). It is ironie that the gendarme's willingness to act on his legal mandate to kill reassures the local population, for eventually Langlois himself realizes that his obsession with blood constitutes a threat to those he protects. At this point in the story, the narrator focuses on the parallel between M. V. and the wolf implicit in the two killers' nearly identical modi operandi. One morning the villagers awaken to find "[un cheval et une vache] ... égorgés et l'on avait mangé un peu dans l'un, un peu dans l'autre. Treize brebis étaient éventrées semblait-il, pour le plaisir de s'agacer les dents dans la laine" (1 16). The description of the wolfs sadism echoes the discovery of the mutilated pig, the handiwork of an individual whose motive is "le plaisir," a divertissement meant to relieve his boredom. The narrator emphasizes the similarities between M. V. and the wolf by attributing human characteristics to the beast. In one excerpt, a literary allusion becomes the vehicle for the personification of the wolf, which is described as "quelqu'un qui ne s'embarrassait pas de figurer ou non dans les fables de La Fontaine" (1 16). And again, "c'était certainement un monsieur dont il fallait éviter les brisées au coin d'un bois" (116). The anthropomorphism stands out in the pronoun "quelqu'un" and the noun "monsieur." In the same passage, moreover/the wolf exhibits human affect and reasoning, as evidenced by the phrase "ne s'embarrassait pas." There are numerous similarities between the human killer and the animal in this episode, not the least of which is an unimaginable cruelty. Jean-Pierre Piniès notes that in folk belief, the wolf is "sans doute l'animal le plus craint... et sa réputation est bien établie dans la tradition orale" (144). The narrator of Un Roi, too, insists on the viciousness of the wolf, observing as he recounts the dramatic hunt that "la cruauté, voyez-vous, inspire. Le loup qui est bien plus cruel que le renard est bien plus fin que lui" (131). What is more, the wolfs attitude as he is cornered by the hunters and their dogs mirrors M. V.'s resignation as he follows Langlois to his execution, since the animal "est allé tout simplement se placer de lui-même au pied du mur, sans esquiver, ni de droite ni de gauche" (142). But the most compelling shared trait is the wolfs fascination with the blood of the hound that he slaughtered. The predator's hypnosis, which recalls M. V.'s admiration of the blood on the snow, his preferred divertissement, confirms the reader's suspicion that there is little to differentiate the animal from his human counterpart. What we have, then, is a man who exhibits lupine characteristics and a wolf that displays human affect. Simply put, two werewolves. While it may not be entirely surprising to find that M. V. and the wolf exhibit similar behavior, the fact that Langlois and the animal have like personalities is unsettling. After all, one does not expect a policeman to have anything in common with a killer, be it man or beast. Jeanne Bern declares that "quand Langlois revient au printemps</page><page sequence="8">60 Kathy Comfort 1846 au village, c'est très exactement en meurtrier victorieux du 'monstre,' donc impur, et en réincarnation du monstre vaincu, donc... porteur de la violence maléfique" (63-64). Bern's reference to Langlois's reappearance in the village as a "réincarnation du monstre vaincu" again evokes the portraits of werewolves in the local museum introduced at the beginning of the novel. In effect, with the execution of M. V. and Langlois's nomination as commandant de louveterie, the retired gendarme has become a legitimate predator, because his mandate comes from the king. The slaying of M. V. resonates in that of the wolf since "Langlois lui tira deux coups de pistolet dans le ventre ; des deux mains ; en même temps" (144). The narrator observes ironically, "Ainsi donc, tout ça, pour en arriver encore une fois à ces deux coups de pistolet tirés à la diable, après un petit conciliabule muet entre l'expéditeur et l'encaisseur de mort subite!" (145). The fact that the two executions are nearly identical points to the establishment of a ritual while also demonstrating that the gendarme has acquired a "taste" for the sight of blood on the snow, or at least does not feel an aversion to it.4 This episode marks the point at which the reader realizes that the only thing that distinguishes Langlois from M. V. and the wolf is that the gendarme acts on the authority of the king. If we do not see direct evidence that Langlois derives pleasure from the killings, we do understand, from the reaction of the witnesses, that the viciousness of the act is uncharacteristic of the exacting policeman whose investigation they had observed in the course of three winters. What is more, the lupine motif, now associated with the gendarme, contributes to the reader's understanding of the complex and conflicted Langlois, who struggles with his own latent homicidal urges and his troubling identification with the murderer he is chasing. Norma L. Goodrich reminds us of the parallels between the classical legend of King Lycao of Acadia who, after killing a wolf, becomes a wolf himself. Like Lycao, "Langlois versipellus feels his hair grow gray and his thoughts unable to dismiss a nature more and more canine as it ceased through one great error to be nobly human" (198). We may take Goodrich' s observation one step further and view the wolfs killing as the final stage in the gendarme's transformation into a werewolf, a transformation expedited by his appointment as commandant de louveterie. Because Langlois has been "infected" with the same fascination with blood as he tracks M. V., he seems destined for a killing spree himself. In fact, his new responsibilities only aggravate his urgent need to view blood on the snow. Langlois may thus be compared to a werewolf in that he is not able to control his transformation from a rational human being into a beast. Langlois's struggle against the monstrous transformation eventually becomes the "force motrice" of his actions. Despite his own efforts and those of the villagers, the retired gendarme is unable to shake his psychological troubles. We do not know the exact nature of these disquieting thoughts, since all descriptions of the man come from external sources, but the accounts of his actions as related by those who witnessed his decline offer us some insight. The most significant incident occurs just hours before the ex- gendarme takes his own life, when he has his neighbor Anselmie cut the head off of a goose. The woman later remembers that Langlois Ta tenue par les pattes. Eh bien, il l'a regardée saigner dans la neige" (243). Later, when Anselmie looks for the commandant, she sees him where she had left him, "Planté. Il regardait à ses pieds le sang de l'oie" (243). He remains there until nightfall, hypnotized by the blood, a behavior that mirrors M. V.'s attempt to find a divertissement to substitute for the one that homicide affords him. Dorothy B. Aspinwall sees this as a decisive moment in the narration, for "just as the pig's blood had not sufficed for M.V., the goose's blood does not cure Langlois" (N. 4 One of the strengths of the novel is that we are never entirely sure how to interpret the murders M. V. commits, let alone the executions that Langlois carries out. For his part, Favre concludes that we must see in the blood on the snow "l'inextricable mélange de la pureté et du crime en tout homme et le symbole de la complexité de la conscience" (128).</page><page sequence="9">Giono 61 pag.). Langlois, however, differs from the other two killers in that he is aware of the danger the hypnotic effect of blood on snow represents for him. That evening he returns home and, by all accounts, follows his routine, but the calm is shattered when his wife and neighbors hear "au fond du jardin, l'énorme éclaboussement d'or qui éclaira la nuit pendant une seconde. C'était la tête de Langlois qui prenait, enfin, les dimensions de l'univers" (244). Although the narrator offers no explanation for Langlois' s violent self-immolation other than to cryptically quote Pascal's Pensée 142 ("Un roi sans divertissement est un homme plein de misères" [244]), the reader understands that the commandant de louveterie ends his life because he has not found, as Pierre Citron states, "un équivalent au sang versé, du meurtre (légal ou presque) de M. V." (172). Interestingly, too, Langlois takes his life in autumn, before winter, as if to stop the cycle of killing before it can begin again. This suggests that, like the werewolf, the gendarme is a rational human being until a particular atmospheric condition triggers his transformation into a monster. It also shows that the former gendarme remains lucid enough to put an end to the senseless violence once and for all by removing the source of infection. For his part, Jean Arrouye speculates that in killing himself, Langlois kills M. V. a second time, "spirituellement," and that his suicide demolishes the killer's "héritage mental" (16). The instrument with which the retired gendarme commits suicide is somewhat puzzling; given his profession, self-immolation by firearm would seem to be the obvious choice. It would also befit the suicide of a werewolf who, according to folklore, can only be destroyed with a silver bullet (Poueigh 204). However, by "smoking" a stick of dynamite he had stored in a cigar box, Langlois mimics the activity that had previously served as a divertissement. In effect, the retired policeman uses one divertissement to end his obsession with another. Langlois' s suicide essentially removes the danger he poses to the community while symbolically destroying the seat of the contamination, his troubled mind. The complex narrative that is Un Roi sans divertissement uses the folkloric imagery, in particular the werewolf motif, and the conventions of the local legend to develop the characters of M. V. and Langlois. The oral nature of the novel and the borrowings from popular belief of Languedoc are an integral part of the narrative structure, a manifestation of Giono's technique of describing everything "sauf l'objet [qui] apparaît dans ce qui manque" (Giono "Préface" 1278). This particular device is evident in the indirect character development of M. V. and Langlois, both of whom emerge from the descriptions of their environment and the individuals whose lives they touch as well as from the folk belief of Southern France. We never have any insight into the mental states of either man, which prompts Philippe Arnaud to conclude that Un Roi sans divertissement may be read as "un éloge de l'incompréhension" (215). The werewolf motif reinforces that theme in that it offers the folkloric explanation for compulsive, inexplicable behavior, which in the cases of M. V. and Langlois manifests itself in the desperate search for a sufficient divertissement. The mythical creature evoked early on drives home Giono's belief that "les mobiles des actions humaines sont habituellement beaucoup plus complexes et plus variés qu'on ne se les figure après coup" (Quoted in L. Ricatte 1294). University of Arkansas</page><page sequence="10">62 WORKS CITED Antoine-Machu, Anne.
