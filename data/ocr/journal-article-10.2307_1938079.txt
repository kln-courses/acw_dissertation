<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS phasizes the uncomfortable truth that fire effects on any given factor are quite variable, and reveals how little is known about the causes of that variability. Chapter 8 on wildlife is the best survey on this topic I have seen, while Chapter 9 on vegetation seems less comprehen- sive. However much of the detailed information on effects of fire on vegetation are found in Chapter 10, Fire as a natural process in forests. This last chapter would make excellent out- side reading for a general ecology course. Volume II details legal, economic, and management con- straints associated with fire use, prevention, and suppression as well as considerable "how to" information. What makes this manual interesting to someone not at all interested in starting fires or putting them out is the relation (and at times lack of relation) of these considerations to our basic under- standing of the properties and effects of forest fire. There is still a large gap between what ecologists view as sound fire management strategies and actual policy for many public and private forest lands. These two volumes will certainly lead to better compromises between ecological, economic, political, and legal considerations. In summary, these volumes are well organized and written. The international authorship has resulted in a truly worldwide breadth of coverage. The cost of the two volumes is a bit much for textbook use, but they will be well worth the price to students of forest fire ecology and management. NORMAN L.

Mate choice in plants: tactics, mechanisms, and consequences. Monographs in Population Biology 19. Princeton University Press, Prince- ton, New Jersey. xi + 251 p. $35.00 (cloth), $12.50 (paper). In this volume, Willson and Burley explore the tantalizing possibility that pre- and postzygotic events lead to mate choice in plants. They employ a broad definition of mate: "a partner accepted for shared parenthood of viable offspring." Thus, selective mating could result from differences in pollen tube growth, seed abortion, or, in the case of gymnosperms, abor- tion of embryos within a seed. The book is packed with in- formation on the "natural history" of sexual reproduction in a wide range of organisms, and is worth reading for this reason alone. It is aimed at two audiences-botanists interested in population biology and suborganismal processes, and evo- lutionary biologists studying sexual selection. This ambitious approach is sure to invite criticism, but also deserves praise. The first chapter summarizes evolutionary theories of mate choice in both animals and plants. In plants, male and female fitness can be considered separately, although most species are hermaphroditic. As with animals, parental investment by reproductively successful females is usually greater than that of males. Differential investment in offspring can lead to sex- ual selection, typically involving competition among males for females and/or preferences of females for particular males. Drawing on parallels between plants and animals, the authors review theories of kin selection, parent-offspring conflict, and parental manipulation. This sets the stage for subsequent chapters dealing with how mate choice might actually be ac- complished in plants. Male-male competition and female choice can take place before or after fertilization has occurred. In angiosperms, a diverse array of breeding systems has evolved to promote outcrossing. It is not unlikely that when crosses are compat- ible, more subtle mechanisms allow discrimination on the basis of genetic criteria. Differences in the timing of pollen germination and growth through the style, for example, could determine which males achieve fertilization. If resources rath- er than pollen availability limit plant fecundity, competition among young seeds or fruits, perhaps coupled with selectivity by females, could determine which offspring are spared abor- tion. In gymnosperms, the potential for mate choice is primarily postzygotic, since arriving pollen grains are in direct contact with ovules. In many species, several embryos are contained in a developing seed, but only one survives. Polyembryony can occur when multiple eggs are fertilized, or when geneti- cally identical zygotes are produced from a single fertilized egg (cleavage polyembryony). In the former case, competition among embryos could lead to selective mating if sperm came from different fathers. With either type of polyembryony, mate choice could also occur through differential seed abortion. The authors expand on these hypotheses, recognizing that, for the most part, they indulge in creative speculation due to lack of appropriate data. Fruit set in many species does seem to be resource limited, leading to large fractions of potential fruits not being developed. The opportunity for selective fer- tilization and abortion exists, but we do not know the extent to which multiple paternity occurs within or among fruits, whether females can discriminate among potential mates, or whether selective mating enhances mean fitness of the prog- eny. The dynamics of pollination and seed maturation may, in fact, preclude selection on the basis of pollen or seed ge- notype. Fruit abortion, for example, can be influenced by the supply of local photosynthate and timing of fruit initiation, giving early fruits a distinct advantage over later ones. Thus, the pool of males from which to choose at any given time may be quite small. Willson and Burley skate past these ob- stacles, however, to promote their theory that many devel- opmental phenomena represent evolutionary tactics for op- timizing mate choice. In the concluding chapter, the authors outline emergent hypotheses related to sexual selection in plants. Given the speculative nature of their arguments, it is not surprising that June 1984 1025</page><page sequence="2">Ecology, Vol. 65, No. 3 they identify many areas that are wide open for future re- search. I found this to be at once the most inspiring and most exasperating section of the book. Many hypotheses are indeed testable by experiment, as the authors claim, but others are infuriatingly vague. This is partly due to the anthropomorphic shorthand of sociobiological writing used throughout the book. Botanists, in particular, will wonder how to approach hy- potheses such as H 15, "As the process of choice continues [over large segments of a plant], decision making tends to become more centralized"; and H27, "Both angiosperm and gymnosperm females evaluate the size of the pollen crop." To a large extent, explanations of vaguely stated concepts can be found in earlier pages, but how to test these hypotheses empirically is left to the reader's imagination. To summarize, Willson and Burley have brought together information from previously unrelated fields to build a new conceptual framework for the study of sexual reproduction in plants. By "anticipating nature," they are sure to provoke fruitful debate and experimentation in an area of increasing interest to evolutionary ecologists. I highly recommend this stimulating and controversial book. ALLISON A.

The evolution of insect mating systems. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. ix + 547 p. $35.00. Insect mating systems span the range from simple to bi- zarre, encompassing close to all the perturbations known in animals. Explanations for the origin and maintenance of these various systems have been equally diverse, often involving significant amounts of hand-waving. In The evolution of insect mating systems, Thornhill and Alcock present the first com- prehensive over-view and integration of the field from a Neo- Darwinian perspective. The book begins with a discussion of evolutionary hypoth- eses and tests, addressing in particular the problems associ- ated with studying behavior from an adaptationist viewpoint. Acknowledging that this viewpoint has been extensively crit- icized in recent years, the authors convincingly argue that the approach is valid if carefully and properly pursued. Included in the discussion is a clear explanation of the methods used to study the evolution of behavior from an adaptationist view- point, the pitfalls to each method, and how to avoid such pitfalls. The authors also address the question of level of operation of selection, concluding that for behavioral attri- butes in particular, selection must always operate on the in- dividual level rather than on the group. This theme is repeated at intervals throughout the book. Given the degree to which the literature on insect mating systems is explicitly and im- plicitly pervaded by references to "the good of the species," such repetition is probably useful. The introductory section of the book concludes with chap- ters on Modes of reproduction and Sexual selection theory. The next eight chapters deal with mating systems, primarily from a male viewpoint. The organization is basically chrono- logical, starting with Timing of mate locating and Motivation to copulate and progressing through Sperm competition and the fertilization of eggs. The last three chapters focus on fe- males, including an analysis of the existence/non-existence of female choice, potential mechanisms of female choice, and a classification of female mating systems, along with an analysis of the circumstances under which each system should occur. The book has a number of unusually strong attributes. First, hypotheses concerning the evolution of mating behavior are clearly stated, and a large volume of reasonably current evi- dence testing these hypotheses is presented. Examples are diverse, coming from all major insect groups. In conceptual areas where more examples are drawn from one group than others, this usually reflects the state of knowledge in the field, rather than a particular bias on the part of the authors. An extensive bibliography is included in the book as well, with listings through part of 1982. Second, the authors deal in more detail than is often the case with the underlying issues of heritability and genetics. For example, a very nice section is included examining how female choice of male mates might still be maintained even after heritable variation in the male attribute in question is exhausted. Further, a chapter is included which specifically deals with intra-species or intra-population variation in mat- ing systems. The classification system presented for male and female mating systems is eminently sensible (as is the authors' atti- tude towards unintelligible terminology). Each mating system is examined in the context of the ecology and physiology of the organism in formulating the classification. Such an ap- proach is useful in understanding the role of mating systems in the overall biology of the organism. Finally, the large number of illustrations makes a significant contribution to the worth of the book. Graphs are unusually and consistently easy to understand. Drawings by Marilyn Hoff Stewart and others are superb, and the numerous pho- tographs help in illustrating the organisms and behaviors un- der discussion. The only drawback in this area is that the connection between the text and graphs is sometimes a little tenuous, as the graphs are used not just to illustrate material from the text, but sometimes to add supplementary infor- mation beyond that mentioned in the text. The only difficulty I encountered with the book was a feeling of unevenness between sections dealing primarily with con- ceptual ideas and those primarily containing examples. This was due to the inevitable simplification of each study down to its basic points, clearly done in order to present a diverse number of examples for each topic in a reasonable amount 1026 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
