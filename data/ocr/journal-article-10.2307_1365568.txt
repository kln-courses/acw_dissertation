<plain_text><page sequence="1">Survival in the Wild of Hand-Reared Passerine Birds.-I have several times read or heard the assertion that it is inadvisable to release captive birds because they would be unable to fend for themselves in nature. In view of the elaborate inherent behavior patterns of birds, however, such assertions would appear to be based more on anthropomorphic thinking rather than on evidence. From 1956 to 1964 I raised several species of passerine birds in our home near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Nearly all of the birds were taken from the nest and hand-reared until they reached independence. The birds were kept in an indoor aviary until they were able to fly, and would come to me to be fed. At this stage in their deve!opment, the birds were given access to a large outdoor flight cage. Conditions arose on several occasions that made it desirable or necessary to release certain birds into the surrounding woods. Of the birds so released, two returns have been received as of September 1965. I collected a nestling Cardinal (Richmondena cardinalis) on 10 September 1960 (a relatively late nesting date in southern Michigan). Later I decided that I would like to raise this bird's two nest-mates, so I returned to the nest on 13 September. On that date, however, the nest was empty. A search revealed that the two recently fledged young were perched in Crataegus bushes near the nest. The three birds (two males and one female) flourished during the fall and winter, but they proved to be very destructive by billing and biting the leaves and stems of potted plants, including the tough leaves of bowstring hemp (Sansevieria). By the first week of March (1961) the three young Cardinals had ruined about three fourths of all the plants in the aviary. Consequently, on 12 March (when the outdoor temperature reached 480F), I opened the aviary window to allow the birds the freedom of an outdoor flight cage (8 feet wide, 28 feet long, and varying from 7 to 9 feet in height). Some 10 minutes later I heard one of the Cardinals giving a screaming distress call. The female was on the back of one of the males, who was lying virtually prostrate on part of the framework along the outer wall of the cage. The female's position was similar to that described as "reverse mounting," but she pecked rapidly at the male's crest and his bill, at the same time uttering a rapid, double call-note. Intermittently, the female stopped pecking the male and sang the typical Cardinal song. The female remained on the male's back for approximately five minutes; the male gave the distress call each time the female resumed pecking. The female then dismounted, perched beside the male, and pecked at the feathers on his back and rump. Throughout, the male maintained the prostrate position. The female attacked the male several times, and between attacks twice flew off with a beak full of contour feathers. After the third attack, the male worked his way into a small opening between</page><page sequence="2">SHORT COMMUNICATIONS 305 the cement foundation and a wood box I had placed to serve as a shelter for the birds. The crest of the male now consisted of but one or two feathers. Later that afternoon, I locked this male in one flight cage and the pair in another cage. The mated pair began nest-building activities on or about 23 April, but did not carry through to completion, and eggs were not laid. I released the single male into the woods on 14 June 1961. This bird remained in the vicinity of the cages throughout the summer and courted the female briefly on 27 August, when the aviary door was opened and the pair flew out and into the woods. On 28 April 1963 Herbert Estes, who lived about one mile from our house, called to report that a female Cardinal had been killed on her nest the previous night. At that time the bird was incubating three Cardinal eggs and one egg of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater). I inspected the nest and picked up the dead female Cardinal. This was the hand-reared bird (512- 73923) that I had released on 27 August 1961. I collected two fully feathered, nestling Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus) on 13 June 1963. These were hand-reared in the usual manner. One of the birds died on 7 January 1964. It was necessary to release the other bird (female plumage) on 17 June 1964, because of an impending trip to India. This bird (53-150064) was found dead on 22 June 1965, at Mosherville, Michigan, by Millard N. Huey. In view of the migratory nature of this species, one would surmise that the banded bird had made one round trip between its summer and winter homes since its release on 17 June 1964.-ANDREW J.
