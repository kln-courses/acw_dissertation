<plain_text><page sequence="1">Human Studies 20: 377-381, 1997. 377 A World without Words and the World with Words MELVIN POLLNER Department of Sociology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA I appear in (and outside) the text of A World Without Words in several guises: as one of Goode's mentors at UCLA; as the co-author of an article (Pollner and Wickler, 1985) explicitly critiqued by Goode for using clinical assessments of families as a nonproblematic analytic resource; and as Goode's co-author of a subsequent article (Pollner and Goode, 1990) that considers our divergent treatment of the families of children bereft of conventional communicational competencies. My valuation of A World Without Words should be considered in light of this history, of course, but in reading the research in its current form I was taken anew by its breadth, depth, and significance. It delivers a penetrating, poignant, and reflexively sensitive study of the sightless and soundless worlds of children born with Rubella syndrome; the custodial, clinical, and familial response to these children; and the embodied foundations of intersubjectivity. Because of the panoply of concerns and the originality with which they are explored, the words of A World Without Words will (or should) be read by several audiences: families of children with Rubella and similar disorders; professionals treating children; practitioners of the human sciences; and, would that it were possible, the children themselves. For the human sciences, especially the family of perspectives concerned with meaning, interaction, and experience,^ World Without Words has special value. On the one hand, it realizes and exemplifies key initiatives underlying these approaches. On the other hand, it unsettles their conceptual and method? ological boundaries. In attempting to understand the worlds of children whose sensorium is so different from the subjects typically the focus of qualitative and ethnographic research, A World Without Words contributes to the rethink? ing and perhaps the revising of assumptions, concepts, and methods grounded in the world with words. I should like to indicate several boundary points of the latter that ,4 World Without Words variously transgresses and transforms. Some years ago, Matza (1969) deftly described the ethos of the family of perspectives concerned with the lifeworld. The essence of what Matza termed naturalism is not a commitment to science per se but to "phenomena and their nature" (p. 3). When studying "objects," naturalism's "loyalty to the world" indeed leads to a positivist methodology. When studying "subjects," however,</page><page sequence="2">378 MELVIN POLLNER naturalism's "fidelity to the phenomenon" leads to a methodology adequate to the recognition that unlike objects "Man [sic] creates his reality and that of the world around him, actively and strenuously" (p. 98). Accordingly, naturalism demands that the study of reflective and purposive beings be "combined with the distinctive tools of humanism, ? experience, intuition, and empathy." One of the most significant consequences of naturalism for the sociological study of deviance, continues Matza, is the suspension of the official or "correctional" point of view in describing deviant "others." In its stead, naturalism encourages an "appreciative" stance that suspends exterior moral judgments in order "to comprehend and to illuminate the subject's view and to interpret the world as it appears to him" (p. 25, emphasis in the original). For Matza, as for the early Chicago ethnographers, distinguishing objects from subjects (and determining the appropriateness of a positivist or interpre? tive approach) is not problematic. While the sociological ethnographers may have had to bracket their moral assumptions, they did not have to serious? ly consider whether the hoboes, thieves, and prostitutes they studied were subjects who indeed had a point of view that might be considered and described. One of the few unsettlings of "subjecthood" in sociology occurred when researchers such as Goffman (1961) entered the mental hospital (as researchers). As they considered the significance of hospital life from the point of view of patients, the very behaviors that made them seem beyond the pale of personhood came to be understood as meaningful responses to morti? fying conditions. Until quite recently, however, appreciative understanding of individuals whose status as "subjects" is popularly and professionally prob? lematic has not advanced. In attempting to access the point of view of silent and sightless children such as Christina, however, Goode moves the line sep? arating "us" from "them." He extends the purview of the appreciative stance to include individuals frequently seen as so "other" as to defy consideration as subjects (cf. Ashmore, Wooffitt, and Harding, 1994). As Goode expands the purview of the appreciative stance, he expands as well the repertoire of methods at its disposal. Most contemporary qualitative research is confined to persons and groups dwelling within the world with words. Indeed, ethnographers frequently capitalize upon their shared sym? bolic communicative competence with their subjects, for example, by asking them what they are doing and why they are doing it - and sometimes incorpo? rating those responses into the ethnographic representation. Ethnography is itself a project originating within and deeply shaped by the world with words. The very metaphors used to formulate the concerns of sociological ethnog? raphy originate in the concrete activities of seeing and saying. Researchers are concerned, for example, to understand the "actor's point of view" and</page><page sequence="3">A WORLD WITHOUT WORDS 379 "definition of the situation" in the subject's "own terms." The precepts and practices of conventional ethnography are inadequate or irrelevant, howev? er, for a world without words. What, indeed, does it mean to describe the point of view of subjects who literally have no "view," utter no "terms," and proffer no "definitions"? Because the worlds of Bianca and Christina are not accessible to the "worded" methodological policies and practices grounded in a world with words, the conventional must be rethought and refashioned. In the effort to be "loyal to the phenomenon" (Matza, 1969), Goode cre? ates novel ways to access a phenomenological world void of terms, views, and definitions. Through experiments in embodiment in which he simulates blindness or becomes a "passively obedient" playmate prepared to be pushed and prodded into activity by Christina, Goode shows how appreciation of radically different worlds may entail a radically different mode of participant observation. The revision of focus and method highlights embodied processes only dim? ly visible from the world with words. The ethnocentrism of what Goode refers to as the "twentieth century American-language version of the world" cele? brates verbal symbolic communication to the point of equating the capacity for symbolic communication with personhood. Many sociological models of the actor are themselves shaped by the ideology that formal symbolic lan? guage develops about its own significance. One consequence has been an emphasis on the role of language and cognition in the constitution of real? ity while effacing the role of embodiment. Accordingly, the problematic of intersubjectivity is often seen as a precarious accomplishment resting on the capacity to understand one another's talk. Goode's immersion in the person? al and familiar worlds of alingual children, however, reveals a primordial source of intersubjectivity. As he shows, Christina and Bianca, and in the case of Bianca her family, and Goode himself come to understand one anoth? er and to co-constitute a common reality through the ways of their common embodiment. As A World Without Words moves beyond the assumptions and practices of the world with words, the very ways and workings of that world are thrown into relief. In attempting to suspend the ways of his "seeing, hearing, speaking self," in encountering clinical and theoretical versions of alingual children, and in considering the problems of translating wordless communication back into the world with words, Goode provides insight into the practices and prejudgments of practitioners of the word - clinicians, researchers, and aca? demics. In striving to suspend the practices and assumptions of the world with words, Goode identifies their pervasiveness in the conceptualization and treatment of alingual children and their families. Ironically, the project of</page><page sequence="4">380 MELVIN POLLNER describing the world without words reflexively yields an ethnography of the world with words. A World Without Words' unsettling of the parameters of naturalism is fueled by ethnomethodology. It deploys virtually every ethnomethodological initia? tive in as lucid and thoughtful manner imaginable ? continuously aware of the contradictions entailed in that endeavor. But it is not beholden only to ethnomethodology for it seeks to inform and even reform the practice of clinicians and others involved in the care and conceptualization of children with communicational disabilities. In speaking to both the human sciences and the humans who are their focus, A World Without Words may well extend the horizon of ethnomethodology itself. At the very least, it not only shows how ethnomethodology can be done, its deep, original, and humane insights show why it should be done. References Ashmore, M., Wooffitt, R. and Harding, S. (1994).
