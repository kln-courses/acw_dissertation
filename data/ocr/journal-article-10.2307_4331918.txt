This paper attempts a critical examination of scholarly understanding of the historical event referred to as "the Darwinian Revolution." In particular, it concentrates on some of the major scholarly works that have appeared since the publication in 1979 of Michael Ruse's The Darwinian Revolution: Nature Red in Tooth and Claw. The paper closes by arguing that fruitful critical perspectives on what counts as this event can be gained by locating it in a range of historiographic and disciplinary contexts that include the emergence of the discipline of evolutionary biology (following the "evolutionary synthesis"), the 1959 Darwin centenary, and the maturation of the discipline of the history of science. Broader perspectives on something called the "Darwinian Revolu- tion" are called for that include recognizing that it does not map a one-to-one corre- spondence with the history of evolution, broadly construed. Keywords: Darwin centennial, Darwinian Revolution, discipline, evolutionary biology evolutionary synthesis, historiography The Darwinian Revolution was probably the most significant revolution that has ever occurred in the sciences, because its effects and influences were significant in many different areas of thought and belief. The con- sequence of this revolution was a systematic rethinking of the nature of the world, of man, and of human institutions.1 It would seem to an outsider that the "evolutionary synthesis" that has characterized recent evolutionary biology - a result of joint activity by geneticists and naturalists - may well constitute a second Darwinian revolution or a second stage of the Darwinian Revolution, or perhaps a transformed Darwinian Revolution. But it should not be thought that the revolution is over.2 'Cohen, 1985, p. 299. 2 Ibid, p. 297.</page><page sequence="2">34 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS Darwin as "Hollywood Epic": The "Darwinian Revolution" in the 1980s By the time I actually encountered it formally sometime in mid-1980s while still a graduate student, the "Darwinian Revolution" was not just an established event, it had become, I would argue, a defining event for historians of biology. A staggering number of books, articles, confer- ences and exhibits, and even documentary dramas and feature films had been devoted to it directly, or to some related aspect exploring the revolutionary Darwin and his world. Revolution in science as a whole was a big topic for discussion in the mid-1980s, especially following the appearance of I. Bernard Cohen's popular Revolutions in Science in 1985.3 The "Darwinian Revolution" got a complete chapter in a book otherwise devoted to revolutions in the physical sciences. Considering the fact that the physical sciences had until then dominated much of the history and philosophy of science, and considering Cohen's own predilections in that direction, the inclu- sion of this chapter and effusive language describing it, indicated that historians of science outside the smaller circles of the history of biology were recognizing the event as being of prime importance. Darwin, the token representative of the life sciences, finally seemed to join the pantheon of those famous "dead white males" in the history of the physical sciences like Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton, of course. It also seemed to silence a range of queries that had begun early in the 1970s about whether or not the "Darwinian Revolution" constituted a "Kuhnian revolution" in science.4 A self-designated "outsider" (see the epigraph above), Cohen's his- toric appraisal was not exactly news to any of the "insiders" in the history of biology. Almost from its start, the Journal of the History of Biology had featured Darwin or some aspect of the history of evolution. The founding of the journal had been facilitated by Ernst Mayr, keen to redress the imbalance generated by the new historiography of biology stressing genetics; as a result of his influence on the journal and his own forays into both the history and philosophy of biology beginning in the early 1960s, Darwin, evolution, and the history of natural history were featured prominently.5 By the mid-1980s, the number of secondary sources available to anyone interested in Darwin or the "Darwinian Revolution" bordered on overwhelming. The occasion of the 100th anniversary of Darwin's death in 1982 served to generate a range of 3See Cohen, 1985. 4 See Mayr, 1971, Greene, 1971, Ghiselin, 1971; and see Ruse 1970, 1971 for just a quick survey of some of this literature. 5 See Smocovitis, 1996 for discussion of this.</page><page sequence="3">RETHINKING THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION 35 commemorative events, lectures and exhibits, which culminated with the appearance of an enormous book titled The Darwinian Heritage in 1985.6 It was therefore no real surprise that a notorious review of the volume in Quarterly Review of Biology charged that the plethora of good works available on Darwin resembled a virtual "Holly- wood Epic."7 The following year, a celebrated essay review appearing in the Journal of the History of Biology, gave name to the glut of workers devoting themselves to Darwin and his world as "the Darwin Indus- try."8 Finally, in 1988, a new epoch in the history of the "Darwinian Revolution" dawned when Darwin was relegated to an afterword in what was a revolutionary work assessing the origins of evolutionary thought in a 19th century radical political context. Adrian Desmond's proletarian-driven The Politics of Evolution was intended to shock expectant readers by leaving the mighty figure of Darwin and his Darwinian evolution until only the afterword of a very long book.9 Instead of diminishing the stature of Darwin, however, this organiza- tional tactic only served to enhance the dramatic conclusion of an otherwise conventional social history; the book only reified Darwin's towering stature in the history of 19th century evolutionary radicalism. Like other impressionable graduate students, I was swept away by the revolutionary fervor. I eagerly anticipated the new books and arti- cles, sought out the critical reviews and especially enjoyed following the public debates - and antics - of the Darwin Industry. In 1987 when the John S. Knight Writing Program at Cornell asked me to design my first course in their "'writing-across-disciplines" series to help initiate stu- dents into the "disciplinary discourse" of my field, I didn't even need to think twice about it; my new course would be on "The Darwinian Revolution." It seemed timely, of general interest to young people, and the perfect book existed to guide the course, Michael Ruse's Darwinian Revolution. Nature Red in Tooth and Claw.10 Appearing in 1979, Ruse's book had quickly become a classic on the subject and was available in paperback edition. It was used widely in teaching courses just like mine. Although there were other books on the topic, 1 Ruse's Darwinian Revolution, came to be synonymous with the historical event designated as the "Darwinian Revolution." This became so much the case, that in my mind, any mention of the phrase "Darwinian Revolution" 6 Kohn, 1985. 7 Ruse, 1986. 8 Lenoir, 1987. 9 Desmond, 1989. ?0 Ruse, 1979; revised edition 1999.

Michael Ruse's The Darwinian Revolution: Nature Red in Tooth and Claw Michael Ruse's book, which served as a popular textbook to many courses taught by historians of biology thus serves as a good starting point for historical understanding of something called the "Darwinian Revolution." It is vitally important to those of us who trained as his- torians of biology after 1979. Ruse's book concentrates on a now fairly familiar story. It locates the origins of Darwinian evolution in the context of Enlightenment views that included belief in progress, in theological movements like natural theology, in the shifting views and practices of traditional natural history, anatomy, and morphology, and in emerging related sciences like geology. The story gives preeminence to the Darwin figure and some details of his life are included, but the book captures more fully the "spirit of the times," the Zeitgeist, or the intellectual milieu as embodied by a group of players whose interactions gave rise to Darwinian evolution and which in turn was shaped by something called Darwinism. The book placed the revolution in Britain; it was unabashedly Anglocentric, for the simple reason that Ruse argued that the British natural theology tradition, which Darwin had imbibed during his undergraduate Cambridge days had inspired his interest in adaptation. It argued for the importance of Lyell's uniformitarianism in shaping Darwin's natural history, and argued that Darwinian natural selection with its non-purposiveness and its challenge to the argument for God's design, effectively killed Aristotelian teleology, though that did not necessarily stop belief in a higher purpose or in progress (two additional points Ruse carefully pointed out). The relationship between something called "0science," a practice Ruse was following the emergence of, and its interaction with prevailing religious views was one of the major themes of the book as a whole. Ruse's book also did much to place Darwin in his philosophical milieu, for example by considering the influence and effects of William Whewell and J. F. W. Herschel on Darwin's philosophy of science. It also explored Darwin's methodology, and his reasoning as a scientist. It assessed the theory in terms of vera causa and whether or not it</page><page sequence="5">RETHINKING THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION 37 demonstrated a "consilience of inductions," which I took to mean that Darwin drew his conclusions from a range of independent lines of evidence. One reason Darwin's Origin had to be taken seriously as a work of science, while Chambers's Vestiges could not, was due to the fact that Darwin structured his argument according to contemporary vera causa principles. Although the book stressed the intellectual backdrop which gave rise to Darwin's theory, it also considered its social origins. The fact that Darwinian evolution emerged within a community negotiating laissez- faire economics that was witnessing the emergence of a modern indus- trial capitalist state was included, as were nitty-gritty historical details crucial to understanding British society like the enactment of the Corn Laws in 1815 and the passing of the First Reform Bill in 1832. Malthus was featured prominently as was Spencer and Tennyson; the very subtitle "6nature red in tooth and claw" directed readers to the fact that a competitive view of nature and society undergirded something called the "Darwinian Revolution." In considering the social origins, Ruse's book did one more thing: it included the fact that the community of scientists - as something called scientists - was in the process of emerging just at the same time. Thus, much about status, professional connections, employment conditions, as well as research program and what counted as legitimate methodology, what Ruse referred to as the "professionalization" of science, were being debated at the same time as Darwin's actual argument. The book's approach thus included insights gleaned from the sociology of British science and not just the social history of mid-nineteenth century Britain. A compact book (some 273 pages of text), it was clearly written, well organized, and was generally a "no fuss" account of what had by 1979 become a fairly complex topic. Re-reading it for this retrospective, I was struck by the breadth of literature that it synthesized and by a meth- odology that was modest and ecumenical; it managed to combine approaches from intellectual history, the philosophy of science, social history and even the sociology of scientific knowledge in an unself- conscious manner. Very much so, Ruse's The Darwinian Revolution included most everything that had accumulated on the nineteenth cen- tury British evolutionary scene by the late 1970s; it was a highly effective summary of the "state of the art" in Darwin and Victorian studies and it achieved this in a manner that made it accessible to beginners. 12 That is 12 See Ghiselin, 1969 (reprint 1984) for an example of an unusually influential book that explored Darwin's reasoning and the "method in his madness"; Ruse engaged Ghiselin's insights directly in his book.</page><page sequence="6">38 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS why it became a popular textbook for instruction to something called the "Darwinian Revolution." Much has happened to our understanding of the "Darwinian Rev- olution" since 1979, however. Only a quick survey of literature bearing on the subject reveals a staggering range of approaches, some of which enhances the perspective developed by Ruse and his predecessors, some of which alters it, while some attempts to directly challenge the #'eventfulness" or the very notion of a "'Darwinian Revolution" as whole. How do we make sense of this literature given the broad and what appears at times to be conflicting approaches, methodologies and interpretations offered? What key points can we extract from this recent work? In short, how exactly, and to what extent, has the "Darwinian Revolution" actually altered in our understanding? And should we even believe in the notion of a "Darwinian Revolution" at all? The "Darwinian Revolution": Here and Now Assuming we choose to uphold the notion of the "Darwinian Revolu- tion" (I have more to say about this below), the general historian can extract some key points that have emerged from some recent accounts. Many recent biographies, for example, have been especially useful to rendering a more richly contextualized picture of key players like Darwin himself,'3 some of his adversaries like Richard Owen, some of his advocates like Thomas Henry Huxley, as well as of course his codiscoverer, Alfred Russel Wallace.14 What these biographies have contributed is not just detailed knowledge of the lives of these key individuals, but an enhanced appreciation of the sociopolitical and professional context in which British evolutionism developed. It is frankly astonishing to contrast the life of privilege led by more estab- lished naturalists like Darwin to that of Huxley and Wallace, both of whom faced financial exigencies that shaped the kinds of publications and scientific programs that each selected. Beginning with Desmond and Moore's Darwin in 1991 and culmi- nating with the splendid two-volume biography of Charles Darwin by Janet Browne, furthermore, our sense of what counts as "6context" has appreciably widened. It isn't just that we can now see Darwin as the "isquarson-naturalist," or as a rather upright or proper Victorian gentleman, but as a spider-like being functioning as the center of an 3 Desmond and Moore, 1991; Browne, 1995, 2002. 14 Rupke, 1994; Desmond, 1994; 1997; Raby 2001, Shermer, 2002; Fichman, 2004.</page><page sequence="7">RETHINKING THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION 39 elaborate network of naturalist-practitioners that encompassed the vast reaches of the British empire. Browne especially makes us appreciate that his theory was thus not just located in the laissez-faire economic politics of his day, or even in the radical politics of his day, but in the wider imperial ambitions of modern Britain. The extent to which the voyage of the Beagle and other such expeditions that took Darwin's contemporaries like Joseph Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley to the far-flung reaches of the British Empire is now part of any critical history of the "Darwinian Revolution," as are vital questions about the prac- tices of collecting and transporting specimens as vital objects of empire. How institutions like gardens, zoos, and private collections selected these specimens, and whether or not they were displayed, and in what manner they were displayed, are all part of understanding the 19th century context which fostered evolution, as is the interplay of local or "native" knowledge with "elite" scientific knowledge. Here too, the recent emphasis on Wallace, who as commercial collector followed established routes along the ",plume trade" in search of valuable natural history objects has given us an enhanced appreciation of the practices of natural history that fed into the development of evolutionary theory generally, and biogeography in particular. Biographies - by definition - are organized around a figure, but taken as whole, what these sophis- ticated recent biographies of figures long part of the "Darwinian Rev- olution" have done is to refashion these individuals as actors in vast social or cultural networks. Even more traditional areas of interest, like Darwin's scientific research efforts, have been explored in greater detail in some of these biographies. Browne's pathbreaking Volume II, The Power of Place, for example, goes far in examining Darwin's research efforts after the publication of Origin in 1859. What emerges is not only an enhanced appreciation of the diversity of his interests in general, but how exten- sive his botanical researches were in particular. That Darwin relied on botanical knowledge and on examples from the plant world heavily has been generally recognized, but the extent to which he actively engaged in varied botanical researches and the extent to which he may be viewed as a botanist has not been explored sufficiently. How botany - and bota- nists - shaped Darwinian theory and what role they played in the his- tory of evolution is yet another promising area of inquiry opened up by Browne's treatment of Darwin. Yet another aspect of the Darwin figure that emerges from Browne's Volume 11, is the fact that Darwin earned for himself celebrity status. He was one of the first scientists in the history of science to have his</page><page sequence="8">40 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS portraits and photographs heavily recognized by lay audiences, and did not shy away from lavish attention, signing autographs, and posing for a number of photographers. Why is this important to the "Darwinian Revolution?" It allows us to understand that Darwin's status, especially following the publication of Origin, continued to gain with time, thus promoting the credibility and popularity of his "theory" (more about that later) and subsequent work. It also shifts attention to the public face of Darwin, and Darwinian theory, and to the fact that the new profession of "science" served legitimating functions (and was in term legitimated by) popular audiences. A series of related aspects which accompanies any consideration of Darwin's Origin is a closer consideration of authorship, readership, publication history and popular culture as a whole. These are consider- ations that I think are now critical for any modern treatment of the "Darwinian Revolution" and come mostly out of the scholarship of social historians like James Secord, and his Victorian Sensation. 15 According to Secord 19th century evolution (more correctly here transmutationism) was embedded within sets of social, literary, and material practices that resulted in texts like Robert Chambers's Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. As text, it had a life of its own, independent of any authorial intent, or even - radically enough to state - the "content" of the work. What Secord has in mind here is no mere conventional literary analysis that includes close readings (as generally performed by intellectual his- torians) or rhetorical or narrative analysis (usually the domain of literary historians), all of which have been put to fruitful use in the scholarship of the "Darwinian Revolution." 16 He instead has in mind an "experiment in a different kind of history,"'7 one which ultimately challenges the con- ventional understanding of the "Darwinian Revolution" which empha- sized the origin of high theory - and great theorists - but which largely ignored the practical world that was embodied in the production, dis- semination, and readership of popular 19th century texts. According to Secord such an approach "... has made it possible to escape the old image of science as dominated by a handful of great theorists and simultaneously to understand theory making as a form of practice. Intellectual history, which used to be written as a story of dramatic changes in worldview (the 'Darwinian Revolution'), can be recast by looking at the basic material products of cultural life and drawing upon techniques developed for studying ordinary action." 18 15 Secord, 2000. 16 See Beer, 1983, 1986; Levine, 1988. 7 Secord 2000, p. 518. 18 Ibid, p. 520.</page><page sequence="9">RETHINKING THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION 41 Secord is at pains to demonstrate much of this operating, by closely following the production, dissemination, and the reading of Chambers's Vestiges. His book is an impressive work of scholarship that alters the terrain of the "Darwinian Revolution," considerably. It succeeds in opening a window into the reading world of the 19th century and allows us to gain deep appreciation of the publication, and more generally the production, of scientific texts. It allows historians to appreciate how diverse and vast the readership for popular science was, as well as to appreciate the fact that there was a popular demand for cosmic trans- mutationist theories well before Darwin's Origin. Chambers's Vestiges was indeed an important "iscientific" text in its time but that was also because what counted as science was actively being negotiated; ulti- mately, its impact in the history of evolution may very well have been to serve as the "testing ground" for more conservative texts that would come to represent modern science more closely like Darwin's Origin. There is therefore much to Secord's conclusion that "[t]he Origin was important in resolving a crisis, not in creating one."'9 All of this is interesting and important to our understanding of the 19th century Victorian scientific context broadly construed. Certainly, anyone interested in the history of evolution after "Secord, 2000," will take the 1844 publication of Vestiges very seriously, and of course anyone assessing the impact of Darwin's Origin will appreciate further the fact that his celebrated text was the embodiment of a set of practical concerns. I am not so sure that Secord's larger ambition to "decon- struct" or perhaps to "decenter" something called the "Darwinian Revolution" is as effective, however. It isn't so much the theoretical scaffolding that he has put to use (in my mind a very productive use), that is so much the problem, but that his understanding of the '"Dar- winian Revolution" is, to put it mildly, a crude and dated caricature of the celebrated event. Leaving it to the final chapter, Secord builds to the triumphal conclusion where he reveals the intent of his analysis and that is his belief that his approach will extinguish the "great man of history" approach that stresses "great works" and "'great theories" which cul- minate with "igreat events" like the "Darwinian Revolution." The fact of the matter is, that few reputable historians of science have upheld any of those notions for a couple of generations, at least. As of the mid- 1980s, it was historians well "outside" the area like I. Bernard Cohen who spoke of the "Darwinian Revolution" in such celebratory - and naive - historical terms. Even the most hard-line of the "Darwin Industry" in the 1980s (who I take to be some of the folks contributing '9 Ibid, p. 514.</page><page sequence="10">42 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS to volumes like Kohn's Darwinian Heritage), did not hold such a heroic view of Darwin or a simplistic view of the "Darwinian Revolution." Thus, when Secord has in mind "an old image" of science (see the quotation), I take it to mean a very old image, and one in my mind that ceased to exist for nearly all historians of evolution by 1979. Even in his treatment of Chambers, Secord underestimates the importance given to him by historians before 2000. Although a full and nuanced picture was lacking, Chambers - and his text - were actually taken very seriously by historians of evolution; he is after all a major player in Ruse's 1979 textbook. Secord's attempt to "decenter" the "Darwinian Revolution," and his organizational, (or perhaps rhetorical) tactic of leaving Darwin and the "Darwinian Revolution" until the final chapter was not the first such effort. As noted, it followed the precedent established earlier by Adrian Desmond in The Politics of Evolution who argued that transmutationist theories were part of the radical politics that swept through Britain in the 1930s. It is used again by another book - yet again published with the same press (the University of Chicago) - that seeks to challenge the "Darwinian Revolution" but with a different project in mind. Its goal is not so much to "decenter" the "Darwinian Revolution", but to geo- graphically and therefore culturally relocate the origins of the theory associated with it to a continental and Germanic philosophical tradi- tion. Titled The Romantic Conception of Life, the book aims ultimately to relocate not just evolutionary thought, but the origins of the whole of biology to an earlier German philosophical context. Anyone following the work of its author, Robert J. Richards, should have seen this coming. In the course of his career he has argued for a broader definition of the term "evolution," one that includes its devel- opmental or embryological meanings.20 It is this "ecumenical" defini- tion that takes him to earlier and non-Anglocentric, Germanic locations for understanding the origins of evolutionary thought; and it most definitely is thought that interests Richards. Unlike Secord (and even Desmond) Richards upholds the notion of thoughts, ideas and theories, though they are held by frail human creatures seeking such romantic ideals like love and meaning in life. The title of this book The Romantic Conception of Life, is thus a deliberate word play on life, love, biology, and the attempt to find a meaningful worldview for a group of amorous turn-of-the-nineteenth century Germanic thinkers. It is a rich and impressive work of scholarship that makes a convincing case that the word "evolution" has been much more varied than the narrower view of 20 See Richards, 1992a, b.</page><page sequence="11">RETHINKING THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION 43 "species change" usually associated with Darwin and his theory of descent with modification. It is indeed productive to explore the extent to which the German Naturphilosophen or German Romantic thinkers like Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling held evolutionary theories and the extent to which such views of "dynamische Evolution" shaped or even resembled subsequent evolutionary theories that may have led to mighty Darwin. It has been a long established historical fact that Darwin did nothing short of worship Humboldt and heavily emulated this romantic ideal, especially in his view of the natural world. It is also vitally important to consider seriously the various efforts of embryol- ogists to grapple with developmentalist theories of species change, especially by historical figures like Karl Ernst von Baer (and later figures like Ernst Haeckel). Richard's book provides historians of biology with a marvelous set of characters, an imaginative set of texts, and a rich earlier epoch to explore more fully in the conventional narrative of the history of biology. There is much to his sense that historians of evolu- tion must consider the "romantic" contexts under which the term gained general use, and there is much to his call to study the linkages between embryology and evolution; but does it radically alter our understanding of something called the "Darwinian Revolution?" Only if we ascribe to a view of history that seeks simple origins of simple high theories, and only if we ascribe to a view of science that has it "growing" in some orderly fashion from one source of origination. I suspect few historians of biology, post-1979 would have such a positivistic take on the historiography of science. The fact that scientific terms like evolu- tion have shifting meanings and even that as a theory or as an object of study, something called "evolution" had multiple foci of use isn't too difficult to accept, especially for students of etymology. Where Richards does err, I think, is in underestimating his readership, which doesn't actually need constant reminder that the mighty Darwin comes at the end of such a richly convoluted history, especially in the morph of "Old Testament prophet" in John Collier's famous posthumous portrait.2' Where Richards ends with the Darwin figure, the work of Peter Bowler that most directly bears on the topic of the "Darwinian Revo- lution," actually begins with it. I would argue here that there are some resonances between Richards and Bowler beginning with a shared commitment to the history of thought or intellectual history. Researching the fate and acceptance of Darwin's theory of "descent with modification" (later dubbed "'evolution"), Bowler was struck by 21 Though I rather like the stark contrast between this sober ending and the beginning epigraph recounting Goethe's erotic attachment to his lover's spine.</page><page sequence="12">44 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS the extent to which the most important - and indeed novel - aspect of Darwin's theory, namely, natural selection, did not gain widespread currency. Following the interval of time between about 1890 and 1920, the period Julian Huxley later called "the eclipse of Darwin," Bowler was struck by the number of evolutionary theories without natural selection that gained currency at the turn of the century. His first book surveying this period titled The Eclipse of Darwin, published in 1983 was then followed by a book exploring the impact of Darwin, Darwinism, and evolutionary theories in the wake of the publication of Origin, titled provocatively as The Non-Darwinian Revolution. 22 By now the gist of Bowler's argument should be obvious: a revolution in thought did take place leading to the emergence of a number of evolutionary theories that did in fact draw on a range of diverse thinkers that included some Germans, the most noteworthy of whom was Ernst Haeckel. A devel- opmentalist evolutionary view that stressed progress preceded Darwin and continued to thrive even after Darwin articulated natural selection which was, arguably materialistic and mechanistic and therefore non- teleological, but that ultimately did not gain acceptance until well into the 20th century with the establishment of "the synthetic theory of evolution." Darwin may have contributed to the belief that evolution was a fact of life, but his cherished natural election remained unac- ceptable for a long time afterwards. In lieu of this, Bowler calls for a more pluralistic view of the history of evolution and "6welcomes" such "historical studies that loosen the hold by the 'Darwinian Revolution' upon our imaginations." The figure of Darwin is "'a central figure still, but he should no longer be the pre-eminent focus of attention." The fact that there are so many papers and so many historians willing to read them should not he notes "blind us to the fact that there were devel- opments in 19th century evolutionism in which his participation was not the critical factor."23 Bowler's analysis which explores the fate of evolution and is inclusive of "failed" theories well into the twentieth century is a much needed addition to the literature on the history of evolution. Little of his argument is objectionable and I applaud his historiographic insight that locates the importance of the "Darwinian Revolution" firmly in modern biology (see below). I especially welcome his cojoining the "Darwinian Revolution" or more correctly his "Non-Darwinian Revolution," with the larger event known by historians as "the evolutionary synthesis," which in traditional historical lore has argued that it took events in 20th 22 See Bowler, 1983, 1988. 23 Ibid, p. 202.</page><page sequence="13">RETHINKING THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION 45 century science like the "rediscovery of Mendel," the establishment of a particulate theory of heredity, and the theoretical and practical insights of the celebrated "architects" of the evolutionary synthesis to bring to fulfillment the Darwinian project.24 In writing his celebratory chapter on the "Darwinian Revolution," I. Bernard Cohen must have been talking to Harvard colleague Ernst Mayr when he linked the Darwinian Revolution with the 20th century ".evolutionary synthesis," that obvi- ously wasn't quite over yet.25 The question remains does Bowler's argument seriously challenge the "Darwinian Revolution?" The answer is only if we cling to the view that Darwin was some heroic figure and the event in question involved some kind of intellectual upheaval in worldview. As I have already noted, such a case was not made in the 1979 account of the "Darwinian Revolution" that I do think was vital to establishing the event as event for a generation of historians. Where Ruse's account differs funda- mentally from Bowler's is in the temporal frame covered by something called the "Darwinian Revolution." Ruse's account is strictly mid- nineteenth century while Bowler takes the study of evolution well into the 20th century. This does not strike me as a hugely conflicting point of view; Ruse's subsequent work in his Monad to Man takes a similar direction when it enters the 20th century. A Return to 1959 and Discipline, Identity and History There is only thing missing from Bowler's account of 1988 and all of the literature covered so far in my essay: the phrase "evolutionary biology." To be fair, Bowler does include the importance of "evolu- tionary biology" as a formal scientific discipline and its role in shaping the history of evolution in the new third revision of his popular general history of evolution, Evolution. The History of an Idea. 26 The reason this is vitally important to understanding the "Darwinian Revolution" is that nearly all of the early historical literature feeding it followed in the wake of the emergence of this discipline, which I have argued accompanied the historical event known as the "cevolutionary synthesis."27 It was only after it emerged, only after canonical texts 24 The best example of this is Mayr and Provine, 1980. Revised in 2000. 25 See Gould, 2002 for more of this. Cohen had described Mayr as "mentor and friend" in dedicating his book. 26 Bowler, 2003. This book now serves as textbook for many courses of instruction on the general history of evolutionary thought. 27 Smocovitis, 1996.</page><page sequence="14">46 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS were established, critical problems had been agreed upon, formal sci- entific societies organizing evolution had been formed, with key indi- viduals serving as the discipline-builders, that the history of the discipline needed to be written. It needed to be written because one of the key functions of disciplinary histories is to create a shared col- lective identity with a coherent narrative of origins; and evolutionary biology was a discipline sorely in need of unifying narratives (as was the whole of biology) because of its fundamental heterogeneity in the middle decades of the 20th century.28 In the case of scientific disciplines, furthermore, the writing of dis- ciplinary history had to involve the establishment of "founding father fables," "hero-myths," "high theories," and the kinds of "dramatic revolutionary worldview-shattering upheavals" that the caricatured version of the "Darwinian Revolution" represents. Such caricatured disciplinary histories of Darwin and the "Darwinian Revolution" were mercifully few and far between and limited to scientist's own histories. 29 Gertrude Himmelfarb's famous book ushering in the age of Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution is anything but "hero-worship" (as a graduate student, I thought it bordered on character assassination). Gavin de Beer's follow-up in 1963 represented a scientist's "internalist" account of the origins of Darwinian evolutionary theory, but even it lacked some of the excess generally ascribed to "scientistic" disciplinary history. The 1959 Darwin centenary was indeed the pivotal moment in the emergence of histories of "Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution" (though I doubt Himmelfarb wished to serve as disciplinary historian). As recounted in the history of the biggest of the organized celebrations honoring Darwin and his great work, namely the famous Darwin Centennial at the University of Chicago, one of the astonishing facts to emerge was the paucity of any scholarship on Darwin and the history of evolution.30 Organizers tried valiantly to include historians of science in the cel- ebration and to include historical perspectives on Darwin in the planned publications, but were unable to secure anyone. Ironically, the first person approached was none other than 1. Bernard Cohen.31 The three- volume set named Evolution after Darwin (edited by Sol Tax),32 that 28 See the historiographic discussion in Smocovitis, 1996. 29 See Ernst Mayr's introduction to the facsimile edition of On the Origin of Species published by Harvard University Press in 1964 for an example of this. 30 Smocovitis, 1999. 31 Cohen could not "take on another job."

Out of 2,500 formal registrants, with nearly 250 delegates representing 189 colleges, universities, and learned societies, from fourteen countries, only one professional historian of science attended.33 The anniversary of 1959, coming in the wake of the emergence of the discipline, began to generate the momentum that led ultimately to the writing and rewriting of the history and philosophy of biology by Ernst Mayr and others that evolved to the "Darwin Industry" by the 1980s. But well, by then, historians of science had themselves become disciplined as historians and no longer served the needs of evolutionary biology. By 1979 his- tories of the "Darwinian Revolution" like that embodied in Michael Ruse's book were serving different disciplinary functions, namely the enrollment of practitioners to the discipline of history of science. Nar- row "internalist" accounts and narrow "externalist" accounts were al- ready being collapsed by contextualist approaches, even though they now appear to have a more limited view of what counts as context. Rethinking the Darwinian Revolution: Closing Thoughts My overall sense is that much of the disciplinary historiographic struggles had already been resolved by 1979, and that is perhaps why Ruse's The Darwinian Revolution has some notable staying power. As I have tried to note in this essay, any current account would add wider perspectives, some new characters, more diverse national and geographic foci, consideration of fields like botany (and how they played into the establishment of evo- lutionary theory and practice), and perhaps a clearer sense that something called the "Darwinian Revolution" does not map a perfect one-to-one correspondence with the history of evolution as a whole, much of which continued - and continues - into the twenty-first century; it really "ain't over 'til its over" as the famous saying goes. The 1979 book clearly served as disciplinary history, but a history intended for an audience who was generationally prepared to problematize any major historical event as a historical construction. That view in no way diminishes something called the "'Darwinian Revolution," and may be the only way to continue to understand in a deep way what the community of historians still recog- nizes as worthy of scholarly attention. 33 Robert Stauffer represented the History of Science Society. John C. Greene drove up from Iowa to attend some of the sessions. He was busy writing his own book The Death of Adam.</page><page sequence="16">48 VASSILIKI BETTY SMOCOVITIS References Beer, Gillian. 1983.
