<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Sportsmen and the Origins of Conservation. By John F. Reiger. (New York: Winchester Press, 1975. Pp. 316. $10.00.) The conservation movement in the United States, a number of historians have written, was originated by scientists, political leaders, and middle-class reformers during the Progressive Era. Not so, says John F. Reiger. In this book, he claims that upper-class American sportsmen were the real spearhead of conservation long before the Progressive period. Reiger also attempts to refute the belief that American hunters and fishermen have been primarily responsible for the destruction of native wildlife. He claims 138</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews that true sportsmen always gave animals a realistic chance, had an "aesthetic appreciation" of sport (22), and were committed to the perpetuation of wildlife. The conservation movement, argues Reiger, first focused on wildlife, national parks, and timberland. Sportsmen had established game preserves and fish hatcheries and were managing forests beginning in the 1870s. Furthermore, he claims, many biologists in the late nineteenth century chose their profession because of interests acquired when they hunted or fished. Central to the development of the American conservation movement, thinks Reiger, was George Bird Grinnell. He was typical of the wealthy conservative upper-class sportsman of the period, although his level of education was unusual. Holder of an earned doctorate from Yale, he edited and long owned Forest and Stream, a leading sportsmen's journal, from 1876 until 1911, and used its pages as a forum for his influential views on the proper management of wildlife. Grinnell wrote and edited many books on Indians, the West, hunting, and camping. He was largely responsible for the creation of Glacier National Park, pressed for the establishment of the Adirondacks as a wilderness area, and attempted to eliminate commercialism in the management of Yellowstone Park and to ensure protection for its wildlife. Grinnell founded the first Audubon bird group. He also, with others, organized the Boone and Crockett Club, the first private group that dealt "effectively with conservation issues of national scope" (23). One member, Theodore Roosevelt, acquired his influential views on conservation mostly from Grinnell in the fifteen years before becoming governor of New York. Reiger, who wrote his dissertation and several other works about Grinnell, has also devoted a large share of this book to him. This attention is merited, as Grinnell was greatly influential in his lifetime. The book does not present a balanced discussion of conservationists, however. The author lists eighty of them early in the book, and he does comment on some; for instance, he sees Gifford Pinchot, another giant in the field, as primarily a manager in conservation matters, with few original ideas. But few, including some active before the Civil War, are accorded more than passing mention. Some receive greater attention in the picture section than in the short (140 pp.) text. The ninety-two illustrations pertaining to hunting, fishing, and conservation are interesting but might better have been scattered at appropriate points throughout the text. One avowed purpose of the book constitutes a weakness. Reiger seeks to defend present-day hunters from their detractors. He feels that critics frequently argue from ignorance, failing to understand, for instance, predator-prey relationships. Hunters often take the blame for wildlife losses when other factors such as human overpopulation or pesticides may be responsible. Critics often neglect to protest against fishing, their sentimental anthropomorphism leading them to identify with mammals and birds but not with fish, reptiles, or amphibians. These criticisms have some validity, yet Reiger tries to defend twentieth-century hunters by describing the merits of upper-class hunters in the nineteenth century. The reasons for the wrath of conservation groups against hunters in the twentieth century remain largely unexamined by the author. He says little about the many present-day hunters who are neither wealthy nor upper class, nor does he speculate about how many of them observe the older hunting ethic. He does not discuss the quarrel between hunters and conservationists over the role of predators in the West, a very old controversy. Little mention is made of the increased number of hunters and fishermen in the twentieth century or the diminished animal popula tions and habitats. Reiger's claims for nineteenth-century hunters may be overstated. Grinnell him self stated in 1925 that the "original purpose" of the Boone and Crockett Club had been to "make hunting easier and more successful" (Grinnell and Sheldon, 139</page><page sequence="3">The Historian Hunting and Conservation, xi). Not until the late 1890s did a change of emphasis come about. Reiger thinks contemporary historians are strongly influenced by current public opinion on hunting, and he hopes to change their perceptions. He has shed light on the motives of nineteenth-century hunters and fishermen. Reiger writes well and knows the literature of his subject. One hopes that he will take the time in the near future to share in greater detail the fruits of his research. Pace University Keir Î’. Sterling</page></plain_text>
