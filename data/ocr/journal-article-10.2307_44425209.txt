<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Metaphoric Images for Computers in Education Daiyo Sawada Current Images Images of computers in the press today are dramatic, powerful- and anthropomorphic. At times they create a sensationalism sinister in its implications: The image of a computer is that of a person; the image of a person is that of a computer. Such images lead to unnecessary and irrational fear based on visions which force man to compete with (or be replaced by) computer tech- nology rather than to reciprocate in a mutually enhancing way. Consider this image from Cetron, Soriano, and Gayle (1985) as they comment on schooling in the Twenty-First Century: Once the quality of educational software im- proves, schools will be able to teach and drill students in basic skills more efficiently and also increase the percentage of students achieving certain minimum competencies, (p. 20) What is frightening in this statement about the Twenty- First Century is the utter nonchalance with which the immense power of computer technology is calmly deformed in order to fit the conceptions of education set in centuries past: In this case, the computer is seen as a sophisticated set of flash cards. There is little hope that education in the Twenty-First Century can truly revolutionize the becoming of humankind when it is entrapped in a conceptual straitjacket that reduces all forms of creative computational trans- formation to the linear forms of simple mechanical tools. Thus, the image in the above quote takes the computer as "just another tool." Even as this image dispels some of the fear engendered by the anthropomorhic mystique of computer technology so popular in the press, it leads to a unidimensional Daiyo Sawada is a Professor in the Department of Ele- mentary Education, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/December 1 985 15</page><page sequence="2">and mechanistic perspective which in the long run may lull us into a false sense of comfort that blinds us to the unique opportunities and transformative forces of electronic computation. In this article, I would like to outline a perspective which, in being part of the evolution- ary vision of man, can lead to a powerful, yet contextual role for computers in the education of humankind in a technological worid. What might this evolutionary vision be? Evolutionary Perspective That man's brain has evolved dramatically over the last five or more million years is a matter of the fossil record, as complete or incomplete as it might be. In particular, the growth of the brain in sheer size has been remarkable over the last million years. During that time span, man's brain has doubled in mass. However, of special significance is the complete levelling off in the growth of the brain over the last 100,000 years, a development which is in stark contrast to previous growth (Dubos, 1968). It is as if growth in brain size is not to be part of the continuing evolution of man. However, is it man's fate that the evolutionary trend over the last 100 million years would come to a screeching halt at the level of intelligence which we now call human? If, as the recent evolutionary trend indicates, the growth of the brain in size has become asymptotic, what new directions of development, perhaps of a sociocul- tural nature, are possible? In searching for a new direction, it is worth considering the general pattern of the brain's evolution with the hope of anticipating new metaphors for future technology in education. According to Jastrow (1 981 , p. 1 27): The human brain consists of several different regions that evolved at different times. As each new section of the brain grew in our ancestors, nature generally did not discard the old parts; instead, they were retained and the latest section was built on top of them. Today, the cerebral cortex, newest and most important region of the human brain, folds around and smothers the older and more primitive regions. Yet these regions have not been completely overpowered. They remain underneath, no longer in undisputed command of the body, but still active. These primitive parts of the human brain continue to operate in accordance with a stereotyped and unthinking set of programs that go back to the mammals on the forest floor, and back farther still to the brutish reptiles who spawned the mammal tribe. Ex- periments have shown that much of the human repertoire of behavior originates in deeply buried regions of the brain that once directed the business of life for our ancestors. Fascinating in Jastrow's account is the building of "new" brain over "old" brain; as each new layer evolved, the contained layers still functioned but only within the context of the new brain. If this "layering" pattern continues, then we can antici- pate that the next stage in brain evolution will be as another layer. Unfortunately, the cranium shows no signs of growing. The latest layer, the cerebral cortex, takes up most of the available space; there is no more room! Under these circumstances, and assuming we do not wish to wait for evolution to manifest the next layer, can we anticipate and then embody through technology what is likely to happen? New Brain as Context The key to the above question lies, I think, in realizing that the layering effect of "new" brain over old brain is the core of a new metaphor: new brain is context to old brain. This metaphor gives us a degree of freedom not available in past evolution: As context, new brain need not be physiologically connected to old brain; it need only in some sense function as context. This opens up alternatives never before possible in the evolu- tion of humankind. For example, as context, new brain can be deliberately and consciously con- structed by man using his old brain and current technology. It is remarkable indeed that just at the stage when old brain can no longer layer itself within its own cranial limitation, it has evolved to a state powerful enough to create its own new layer outside the cranium. That layer, according to Jastrow, is computers. Context as Computers With each passing year, computer technology manages to place more and more information processing power into smaller and smaller electron- ic processors. For example, a microprocessor equiv- alent in physical size to the human cranium can now exceed the information capacity of the human brain! The "evolution" of electronic processors has been nothing short of revolutionary: Computers up to the so called "fifth-generation" have an "evolu- tionary" history of fewer than fifty, as opposed to five million, years. Parenthetically, this dramatic increase in the information capacity of smaller and smaller microprocessors might suggest that the proper development of a computer is as a thinking machine (e.g., as in artificial intelligence). The development of machines that can think with greater power, precision, and discipline than can man has been the theme of many a science fiction or social fiction writer. Such development would also constitute a human fiction in the sense that it is not in tune with the evolution of the human 16 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/December 1985</page><page sequence="3">brain as described by Jastrow, since it involves duplicating the capabilities of the human brain rather than functioning as the new context. I will not therefore pursue this line of development. This is not to deny that considerable insight into thinking might be achieved in electronically con- structing artificial intelligence (see, for example, Lenat, 1 984), or that fundamental departures from the evolutionary trend are worth pursuing. Nevertheless, if we take the evolutionary vision of the brain as sketched above to be not only valid but appropriate as well, then as context, computers will function as new brain; our brains will be old brain. This leads to profound implications. If computers are designed primarily to be contexts for intelligence rather than to be an alternate form of human intelligence, then the adversarial relation- ship between man and computers can be replaced with a cooperative one in which the two together synergistically1 form a new system of intelligence that contains both yet does not confine the one to the other, or pit one against the other, or substi- tute one for the other. This is not to say that computers will not in some sense be intelligent; it is highly likely that they will (new brain always was intelligence of a new kind). What it does mean is that intelligence for computers will have a nature different from that of man. Let us examine the complementary nature of computer intelligence by considering the notion of "common sense." Common sense is something that old brain handles quite easily. Yet, common sense has been a domain which has never been in the mainstream of science. It is as if the nature of common sense is as a subliminal phenomenon which while necessary for intelligent behavior, is never needed in a consciously explicit form in everyday communica- tion. However, when communication breaks down, it is usually due to a misreading of the common sense that was indeed not common (recall the charades that usually pass as "arms negotiations" between east and west). In such circumstances, the usual hand-waving or facial expressions that in more mutual circumstances carry the common sense, no longer carry any sense at all; and since our symbolic means of communication is unable to replace the nonverbal forms that often carry common sense, we lapse into isolated camps from which we cannot resolve our differences. Thus, the direct representation of common sense may be beyond computation and even beyond formal discourse. Nevertheless, some work in robotics and in artificial intelligence is attempting to directly represent common sense. Such attempts, however, are far from satisfactory. The reasons are many. Geoffrey Hinton (1985) gives the following expla- nation as to why computers are remarkably bad at doing what any five-year-old can do: . . . brains and computers work differently. Perhaps brains have evolved to be very good at a particular style of computation that is neces- sary in everyday life but hard to program on a conventional computer. Perhaps the fact that brains store knowledge as connection strengths makes them particularly adept at weighing many conflicting and cooperating considera- tions very rapidly to arrive at a common-sense judgment or interpretation. ... To simulate all the neurons in a human brain in real time would take thousands of large computers, (p. 265) Thus, rather than trying to emulate, simulate, or duplicate common sense, the role of computer as context suggests that in the development of com- puter technology, emphasis ought to be in a direction that sees the common sense of man as a subsystem within an ecosystem of computation. By using the concepts "subsystem" and "eco- system" I am suggesting that the image of comput- er as context can be properly understood by seeing context as ecosystem. In this way the man-comput- er systém literally is a living system. This needs a little elaboration. Computing as Ecosystem The idea of computing as ecosystem is implicit in the more popular notion of "computing environ- ments." Norton (1985) suggests that, "Educators must find a new metaphor for the learning environ- ment. The school as factory is anathema" (p. 19). Seymour Papert (1980), in like manner, stresses the importance of the "LOGO learning environ- ment." The same perspective underlies the current- ly popular second-language programs involving "immersion philosophy," in which environments function to create ecosystems that nurture a child's second language acquisition. In order for immersion programs to thrive, the child-environment system must be seen as a living system. I suspect that this does not occur in many immersion programs and may help to explain their ambivalent success. My hypothesis is that such programs do not consistent- ly "come alive" because there is no conscious awareness of their "living systems" nature. Studies of mammalian neurophysiology bring new insight into the living systems nature of old brain within a computing ecosystem. Paul D. Maclean has extensively studied the evolution of the brain and, as with Jastrow, has identified three brains within one: The reptilian, the paleomam- malian, and the neomammalian. Together these form our current brain, which Maclean (1975) EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/December 1 985 17</page><page sequence="4">refers to as a "triune" brain. As a living system the three formations: are markedly different in chemistry and struc- ture and in an evolutionary sense eons apart. Extensively interconnected, the three basic formations represent an amalgamation of three-brains-in-one, or what may be appropri- ately called a triune brain. The word triune also serves to imply that the "whole" is greater than the sum of its parts, because with the exchange of information among the three formations each derives a greater amount of information than if it were operating alone [i.e., synergism] . Stated in popular terms, the amalgamation amounts to three interconnected biological computers, with each inferred to have its own special intelligence, its own subjectivity, its own sense of time and space, its own memory, motor and other functions (Maclean, 1975, p. 216). From Maclean's work, it is clear that each new layer does not duplicate earlier layers but instead works autonomously yet still in living interde- pendence as a "interconnected biological comput- er." In the setting of Triune Brain, the phrase "biological computer" is just a "popular term" for "computer as ecosystem." Child-Computer Living Systems2 Over the many occasions when I have observed a child-computer system that has "come alive," I have noticed also that the child is oftentimes into recursion. For example, in a LOGO context, children who have gotten into recursion, through giving a program a symbolic reference and then imbedding it in the same program (self-reference), have discovered that fascinating new order emerges on the screen when the feedback loops implicit in the recursion drive the initial information (perhaps a line segment and an angle) into a resplendent geometric design of higher order complexity. The excitement and "mindstorms" which are created by the high order complexity only brings forth more complexity and excitement in a self-generat- ing way (Hofstadter, 1980). Such emerging order is the result of the cyclical feedback loops implicit in recursive self-reference that take the child-com- puter system to new levels of information organiza- tion. But what has this to do with living systems? In seeking an answer to this question it is important to recognize that recursive self- reference is occurring at two different levels in the child-computer system. The simple and Ob- vious level is recursion in the computer program itself. The not so simple and less obvious level is recursion within the child-com- puter system in which the hypotheses and brain- storms that the child fashions are recursively fed back to the child via the programs he or she explores on the computer, and these lead to further hypotheses, which lead to further program- ming; and on and on it goes in a self-generating way. In terms of the "new" cybernetics, what we have here are "deviation-amplifying mutual causal processes" which lead to new unanticipated com- plexity. Maruyama (1963) referred to such process- es as the "second cybernetics." They should be contrasted with the more widely understood inter- pretation of cybernetics as a control technology which focusses on "deviation-countering mutual causal processes" as developed, for example, by Norbert Wiener. When the child-computer system is in the "second cybernetics" mode, it becomes a complexity generating system that can drive itself to new levels of information organization. As an autonomous recursive self-creating system it is life; it is a living system. It has the same living structure as other living systems (see, for example, Varela, 1979; Sawada and Caley, 1985; Sawada and Caley, in press). Thus, as a living system, the status of the computer in the child-computer living system is as an ecosystem. New brain is literally the eco- system in which brain comes alive in ways that are impossible for old brain alone. We have seen this in some LOGO contexts. As another example, consider the idea of networking. Computer Networking Although the networking idea has not been developed as new brain, it nevertheless can func- tion in that way. Computer networks enable students to extend their information needs into a community of people who have overlapping inter- ests and concerns. Such communities are living systems. They exist as networks of communica- tion. As computer networks merge into the global communications technology, ecosystems for stu- dents literally become the world. Some of Dewey's wildest dreams of a global community based on "pen pals" from around the world are no longer wild nor strictly idealistic. Not only can students from around the world access each other's minds through computer networking, they can access the "mind of mankind," at least to the extent that knowledge bases and data bases are part of larger ecosystems. But, more importantly, the establishment of computer networks can set the expectation of networking in general as a context for dialogic communication between and among students and teachers as they establish themselves as new com- 18 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/December 1985</page><page sequence="5">munities of scholars (much as scientists and other researchers do through, for example, "Sciencenet," which was established as a long-haul computer network in 1984 by the National Science Founda- tion). In this sense, networks, as communities, fundamentally alter the condition of schooling. In the past, the teacher has often been the single dominant component of a student's network. As such the teacher has functioned more as a barrier than as a catalyst: New brain for students was simply the old brain of the teacher! For many students this was a most stultifying and delimited ecosystem. However, when the context is seen as a computer ecosystem through which and in which networking can be established with other such burgeoning ecosystems, then the teacher herself joins the community as a system "precursor" who helps the many child-computer systems come alive within the network of community scholarship. Teacher Roles in the Computer Ecosystem Our roles as teachers must change substantially when computer environments are seen as ecosys- tems for mind, but the new roles are by no means exotic. Consider, for example, these exerpts from a report of a recent conference on computing called by the National Council Teachers of Mathematics (Corbitt, 1985, pp. 247-248): Teachers must become effective catalysts for student-directed learning. Teachers must serve as learning models in attacking mathematical questions [teachers as system precursors]. Teachers must be prepared to say, "I don't know yet," while they join students in exploration [teachers no longer pretend they are outside experts who know it all]. Teachers must become facilitators of co-op- erative learning as students engage in realistic learning projects that computers make attrac- tive [teachers become active and cooperative community members] . , For students, the greatest promise and chal- lenge of technology in mathematics learning is the move toward more self-directed and self- monitored learning [child as an "autonomous living system"] . Student-directed learning suggests that stu- dents may become dispersed throughout the learning environment. Teachers must know how to maintain effec- tive communication with and among learners and must recognize that individualized technol- ogy-enhanced learning is not synonymous with independent study [classroom becoming a liv- ing system] . Although the above suggestions are made with respect to mathematics, their appropriateness is not limited to mathematics/ Furthermore, these roles may already be an integral part of the teaching styles of some teachers. The reader interested in pursuing a more in-depth discussion of the theoretical grounding of these roles is re- ferred to Sawada and Caley (June 1985; in press). Epilogue For a long time the metaphor for a computer has been a tool. I think we cling to this linear image so that teachers will not feel intimidated or in any way afraid. But the computer is not simply a technological tool; it is new brain, the ecosystem of old brain. Together they form a new autopoietic living system. As such there is an intrinsically fundamental and appropriate place for computers in education: They are an ecosystem for mind as it explores and lives the universe. This is an evolutionary image that is in tune with the becoming of humankind in our instrumental tech- nological world. Perhaps Capra (1983) expresses it best: In our civilization we have modified our en- vironment to such an extent . . . that we have lost touch with our biological and ecological base more than any other culture and any other civilization in the past. This separation mani- fests itself in a striking disparity between the development of intellectual power, scientific knowledge, and technological skills, on the one hand, and of wisdom, spirituality, and ethics on the other ... Our progress has been largely a rational and intellectual affair, and this one- sided evolution has now reached a highly alarming stage, (p. 42) It is my hope that the ecological vision of computers in education may lead to a direction that encourages "wisdom, spirituality, and ethics" as well as "intellectual power, scientific knowledge, and technological skills." The blessing is that through the new metaphors we can pursue both together. □ Notes 1. Synergy refers to those aspects of a unity that make the unity other than a collection of components. The emergence of such unity in systems occurs through mutual- causative processes which, through recursive interaction EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/December 1 985 19</page><page sequence="6">between and among components, leads to new levels of organization. This new organization is a manisfestation of synergy. Fuller (1975) defined synergy this way: "Synergy means behavior of whole systems unpredicted by the behavior of their parts taken separately. Synergy means behavior of integral, aggregate, whole systems unpredicted by behaviors of any of their components, or subassemblies of their components taken separately from the whole" (p. 3). 2. A succinct account of living systems is given by Durkin (1981) in the introduction to his book on group psychotherapy as a living structure. Durkin refers extensive- ly to "self-referential" processes which, in the computing context, are simply recursive processes within a program that calls itself, thus generating new levels of self-organiza- tion. All of life, from cell to society, is based on a dynamic self-organizing process we shall call auton- omous living structure. Living structure generates, maintains, evolves and, finally, dissolves its own autonomy. Living structure causes itself through the exercise of the following self-referential processes: (1) Living structure describes its own structure by closing informational boundaries around itself, thus distinguishing itself from its environment and other living structures within it. (2) Living structure transforms its own structure by opening its boundaries to the flow of matter/ energy between itself and the environment, as well as between itself and other living structures who open to it. (3) Living structure generates operational configu- rations based on the basic opening and closing operations working in complementarity which achieve the functions of wholeness, self-regulation, and progressive self-transformation. (4) Living structure utilizes boundarying opera- tions to create hierarchical divisions within itself. A group of living parts open to each other and transform themselves into a whole. A whole cleaves boundaries within itself to transform itself into a set of parts. Living wholes and parts freely redefine themselves through the autonomous boundarying operation, (p. xix) References Capra, F. The Turning Point: Science , Society , and the Rising Culture.
