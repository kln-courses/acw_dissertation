<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXX, Fasc. 2 PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL ASIAN AND SIBERIAN SHAMANISM MANABU WAIDA The three decades after 1951 have been a very significant era in the modern history of studies in shamanism. It is true that few ethnographical materials have come out with the notable exception, perhaps, of Schamanengeschichten aus Sibirien,' but the period in ques- tion has seen the publication of a series of important theoretical works which have explored the history and the structure of shamanism, more particularly, the Central Asian and Siberian shamanism that has been generally considered its "classical" form. In 1951, for instance, Mircea Eliade published his magnificent work Le Chamanisme et les techniques archaiques de l'extase. 2 In the mean- time, Wilhelm Schmidt had completed his studies on the shamanism of the pastoral peoples of Central Asia and Siberia in the last four volumes of his monumental work Der Ursprung der Got- tesidee (1949, 1952, 1954, 1955). Especially important is the twelfth and last volume, published posthumously, which contains a "Syn- these der Schamanismen der innerasiatischen Hirtenv6lker" (pp. 617-759). Eliade and Schmidt are extremely divergent in their in- terpretations of the history and the structure of shamanism in Cen- tral and North Asia, but, one may say with the advantage of hind- sight that they have solidly laid the groundwork for the further in- quiry to be made in the subsequent decades by ethnologists and historians of religions.3 In the course of time, two problems have emerged as major issues of basic importance. The first of the prob- lems is the so-called "white" shamanism and the so-called "black" shamanism, and the other is the phenomenon of ecstasy in the state of which the shaman is believed to set out for the spiritual journey to the world beyond. In the following pages I propose first to outline these basic issues with special reference to the works of Eliade and Schmidt, and then I wish to suggest a path towards an improved understanding of Siberian shamanism and shamanic ecstasy. In this regard, closer attention will be paid to the intimate relationship</page><page sequence="2">216 Manabu Waida that exists between the phenomenon of shamanic ecstasy and the belief in a variety of spirits. It might be mentioned, parenthetically, that studies of shamanism are no longer inclined to refer to this religious phenomenon as a product of mental disease. Until 1945, a large group of scholars-with a few exceptions such as Sergei M. Shirokogoroff and Uno Harva-was of the opinion that shamanism, more particularly, the Siberian form of shamanism, is a psycho-pathological phenomenon peculiar to the Arctic and sub- Arctic zone, and that the shaman is a sick person of psychopathological type, suffering from "arctic hysteria."4 This view has, generally speaking, been rejected. The majority of students now maintain that psychic illness as such does not play any decisive role in the religious phenomenon of shamanism.5 The crucial point is that, if we borrow Eliade's succinct expression, "the shaman is not only a sick man; he is, above all, a sick man who has been cured, who has succeeded in curing himself."'6 In sharp contrast to a large number of ethnologists prior to 1945, Eliade has insisted on interpreting the apparently pathological symptoms of the future shaman in terms of initiatory trials, which he is destined to undergo in order to become a "new being." The initiate suffers, but the suffering is for him something to be con- quered. There will be some who will fail in the process, and others who will pass through it triumphantly. But, only those who have accepted the suffering as a spiritual crisis and conquered it are able to become "new beings," that is, strong shamans. White Shamanism versus Black Shamanism Ethnologists and historians of religions had long been well acquainted with the fact that there are two types of shamans, white and black, but it was not until the publication of Eliade's Le Chamanisme and Schmidt's Der Ursprung der Gottesidee, XII, that this old problem became a major issue in the modern study of shamanism.7 Both Eliade and Schmidt recognize the distinction that exists between two types of shamanism: white and black. And they define these two types generally in the same terms; white shamanism is characterized by the ecstatic heavenward journey of</page><page sequence="3">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 217 the shaman, who is concerned with the (benevolent) gods and spirits of the heavenly zones, whereas black shamanism is marked by possession and the journey towards the underworld, in other words, the black shaman in the state of possession travels to the underworld, and even to the land of the dead, and he deals with the subterranean (evil) spirits.8 However, Eliade and Schmidt have arrived at very different con- clusions about the structure and the history of these Central Asian and Siberian forms of shamanism. According to Eliade, it is white shamanism that is the genuine and classical form of shamanism, and what is essential and constitutive for the structure of this white shamanism is the shaman's ecstatic journey to the heavens.9 White shamanism is also historically the original form of shamanism although it has tended to lose its purity in the course of time due to the addition of various elements extraneous to it. In Eliade's view, white shamanism has been best preserved in Central Asia and Siberia but, even there, it is not the only one form of shamanism that exists; there is another form, that is, black shamanism. Accord- ing to him, this black shamanism cannot be viewed as a genuine form of shamanism. It is true that there is a factor in black shamanism which might convince us of its authentic nature, for instance, the spiritual journey to the beyond, particularly, the journey to the underworld. But, this specific element of the ecstatic journey to the beyond has probably been borrowed from white shamanism.'0 And many other components constituting black shamanism are not indigenous to Central Asia and Siberia but, historically speaking, have come from the south. These components include, for instance, the ancestor cult, the belief in guardian spirits, the mystique of woman associated with lunar mythology, "matriarchy," and female shamans, and especially the theory and practice of magic and possession." For Eliade, shamanism is a ge- nuine religious phenomenon, but not an independent religion; it coexists with other forms of magic and religion.'2 In sharp contrast to Eliade, Schmidt views black shamanism as the genuine form of shamanism; for him, the so-called white shamanism is nothing other than the response of a pastoral culture to black shamanism which has come from the matriarchally oriented agrarian culture of the south.13 In Schmidt's opinion, and</page><page sequence="4">218 Manabu Waida here Eliade would agree with him, the religious orientation of the pastoral peoples in Central Asia is essentially different from that of southern agrarian culture; the religion of the pastoral peoples is basically a sky religion and associated with the religious values of the sky and the celestial Supreme Beings, whereas the religious ideology of southern agrarian culture centers around the religious values of the earth, the woman (and/or mother), the ancestor, and the underworld. Schmidt holds that one of the major features characterizing this matriarchally oriented agrarian culture of the south is black shamanism with its phenomenon of possession. For many years he had asserted that black shamanism invaded Central Asia and even the Arctic from the land of Tibet, but shortly before his death he modified his view and redefined its original homeland more broadly as Southeast Asia.'4 When this black shamanism moved northwards and challenged the religion of the sky, the peoples reacted to it with the creation of white shamanism. Schmidt maintains that shamanism, whether black or white, is not an in- dependent religion,'5 and on this point his view coincides with that of Eliade. However, Schmidt insists on this for a somewhat dif- ferent reason: the pastoral peoples in Central Asia had originally enjoyed a pure religion accompanied by the belief in the celestial Supreme Being and its practice.'6 It is shamanism, in his opinion, that has damaged and weakened this primeval purity of the religion of the Central Asian peoples." Obviously, black shamanism had initially nothing to do with the religion of Central Asia, but even white shamanism is for Schmidt a "degenerated" religious phenomenon, which came into existence as the reaction of a pastoral culture to an invasion of black shamanism. This view of white shamanism is remarkably different from that of Eliade, who sees in it the genuine, authentic religious phenomenon character- ized by the element of ecstasy, which he claims is a "primary phenomenon" without history.18 The difference in interpretation between Eliade and Schmidt is mainly due to the different ways in which they evaluate the struc- ture and the history of white and black shamanism. It may be noted, however, that their interpretative differences are further conditioned by their theoretical or ideological frameworks. As far as Eliade's view of shamanism is concerned, it is definitely colored by</page><page sequence="5">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 219 what might be called the ideology of the nostalgia for the primeval paradisal era. To put it briefly, in the beginning of mythical time there existed a paradisal era when communications between heaven and earth were possible. At that time, which Eliade is fond of call- ing in illo tempore, the divine beings (gods and mythical ancestors) descended onto earth freely to mingle with humans, and humans ascended to heaven easily by means of a rope, a ladder, or even with the aid of a chain of arrows. Everyone lived in happiness, and mankind lived in blessed peace with animals, talking with them in the "language of animals." But at a certain moment, due to a ceremonial mistake or similar happenings, these communication- lines between the two cosmic zones were cut and the paradisal era came to an end. And yet, the nostalgia for the lost paradisal era continues to haunt the religious mind of many peoples, as documented in myths, rituals, and folklore. According to Eliade, the lost paradisal era can be restored to the present only by a certain group of religious specialists such as shamans, mystics, or sacred kings even if it is impossible for ordinary persons. "The shamanic ecstasy," Eliade writes, "could be considered a reactualization of the mythical illud tempus when men could communicate in concreto with the sky. It is indubitable that the celestial ascent of the shaman ... is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerated, of this archaic religious ideology centered on faith in a celestial Supreme Being and belief in concrete communications between heaven and earth."19 This ideology, which permeates many of Eliade's works,20 is also dominant in his Shamanism. Archaic Techni- ques of Ecstasy, influencing his interpretation of shamanic ceremonies in Central Asia. Concretely, there are two ceremonies which occupy a supremely important place in Eliade's contention regarding the shaman's ecstatic journey to heaven. One of the ceremonies is the rite of shamanic initiation among the Buriats. The shaman candidate climbs a birch tree, makes nine turns at the top of it, and then comes down, taking up his position on a felt carpet placed at the foot of the birch tree. The nine turns symbolize the nine heavens of the universe; as he makes a turn one after the other, it is believed that he ascends from one heavenly zone to another until he reaches the highest layer of the universe. As he climbs, so we are told, the</page><page sequence="6">220 Manabu Waida candidate falls into ecstasy.21 A strong birch tree is also set in his yurt, with its roots in the hearth and its top protruding through the smoke hole. The candidate climbs the tree; when he has reached its top and emerged through the smoke hole, he shouts to invoke the help from the heavenly gods. This birch has a special name mean- ing the "guardian of the door, " for it serves to the future shaman as the opening to the sky. The shaman's ecstatic flight to heaven is only one of the scenarios constituting the Buriat rite of shamanic initiation, which is unusual- ly complex in structure.22 It can be divided into two phases: (1) the preparatory stage which lasts for a couple of months, sometimes years; and (2) the rite of initiation proper, lasting only one day. The essential features of the rite of initiation are the following three: (1) the shaman candidate is carried on a felt carpet; (2) he is anointed with the blood of a sacrificed goat; and (3) he climbs a birch tree, undertaking the ecstatic heavenly journey.23 There is almost no doubt that the ceremony as a whole is of relatively recent origin, and that it has developed under the influence of southern cultural traditions. While Uno Harva has drawn our attention to Mithraism as a source of this influence,24 Hans Findeisen has suggested the in- fluence of Tibetan Lamaism.25 Points of correspondence between the Buriat initiation ceremony for the shaman and the Tibetan ordination ceremony for the lama are so striking that one can no longer exclude the possibility that Lamaism, together with Mithraism, has played a remarkable role in shaping the rite of shamanic initiation among the Buriats. The horse sacrifice among the Altaians is another very important ceremony which Eliade employs to illustrate what he calls the shaman's ecstatic flight to heaven.26 It lasts two or three days. On the first evening a new yurt is erected in open space, and inside it a young birch tree is set with nine notches cut into its trunk. There is no doubt that the tree is charged with the symbolism of the Cosmic Tree, and that the nine notches symbolize the nine heavenly zones as understood by the Altaians. The horse to be offered to the god Bai Ulg~n is sacrificed on the same evening. The second and most important part of the ceremony takes place on the following even- ing. A shaman in ecstasy climbs up the birch tree from one notch to another, describing to his listeners everything he sees and that is</page><page sequence="7">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 221 happening in each one of these heavely zones. Finally, he reaches the ninth and highest heaven where he humbly addresses his prayer to Bai Ulgdin, offering him the soul of the sacrified horse. At the end, "the shaman collapses, exhausted. The bal-tut-kan-kii (i.e., his helper) approaches, and takes the drum and stick from his hands. The shaman remains motionless and dumb. After a time he rubs his eyes, appears to wake from a deep sleep, and greets those present as if after a long absence.""27 The general impression we get from this account of the celebrated Altaic ceremony is that the shaman's ecstasy is rather a fake, not a genuine one. Eliade himself is well aware of this fact when he speaks of the slight intensity of the shaman's "trance." "In the sacrifice described by Radlov," Eliade states, "the 'ecstasy' is obviously an imitation. The shaman laboriously mimes an ascent (after the traditional canon: bird flight, riding, etc.) and the interest of the rite is dramatic rather than ecstatic."28 While Eliade, nonetheless, is inclined to the view that the Altaic ceremony of the horse sacrifice involves the shaman's ecstatic journey to the heavens, Schmidt presents us with a totally different view. According to him, the Altaic shaman in question has not achieved ecstasy; the shaman, whom Schmidt rightly calls a "white" shaman, may be compared to an actor playing his role on the stage rather than to a mystic properly so called. He is simply undertaking a symbolic journey to heaven as a Himmelsdiener. 29 As Schmidt has put it, "der sog. weisse Schamane ist gar kein Schamane."30 According to him, the essential and original form of Central Asian shamanism is represented by black shamanism, which is concerned with the spirits of the underworld. It involves ecstasy, and in that state of ecstasy the black shaman travels to the subterranean world. Black shamanism, according to Schmidt, is a degeneration of the Central Asian religion that is characterized by the worship of the celestial Supreme Being through the service of the householder. As to white shamanism that obviously exists in Central Asia, Schmidt holds that it is the product of a reaction of pastoral culture to black shamanism of the ecstatic type. Schmidt's view of Central Asian shamanism might give us the impression that it has strong historical foundations. But, in fact, it is firmly conditioned by his two ethnological theories which are</page><page sequence="8">222 Manabu Waida untenable, i.e., primordial monotheism (Urmonotheismus) and the theory of culture circles (Kulturkreislehre). While Eliade's interpreta- tion of shamanism in Central and North Asia is very much colored by the ideology of the nostalgia for the paradisal era in the mythical beginning, that of Schmidt is very much conditioned by his view of the gradual deterioration of the sky religion among the pastoral peoples in Central Asia. To put it briefly, Schmidt claims that at the dawn of human history there existed the purest and most genuine form of belief in one Supreme Being reigning in heaven. He is the creator of the world, all-powerful and all-knowing. As a good Catholic, Schmidt is convinced that this belief in the celestial Supreme Being, i.e., the High God, was given as Uroffenbarung equally to all peoples in the beginning of human history. At the same time, he holds that there is nothing mystical about this belief in the one celestial Supreme Being; according to this rationalist, the idea of the High God originated from the primitive man's causalistic thinking based on his calm and objective observation of the sky. In other words, the purest and most genuine idea of the High God existed in the beginning of history without myths, and without any anthropomorphic representation of God. In his opinion, this form of belief can still be discerned among the most primitive peoples belonging to the cultural stage that he calls primal culture (Urkultur). In the course of time, however, this primordial religion (Urreligion) began to be con- taminated by mythic images and other conceptions of deity. On one hand, the High God became represented by mythic images as if he were a man, and on the other his prestige became overshadowed by other deities and spirits (such as the gods of the atmosphere, the gods and goddesses ruling over the kingdoms of animals and vege- tation, the spirits of dead ancestors, the spirits of animals, and so on). Schmidt views this "differentiation" of the High God into the various divine beings and spirits as a process of progressive deterioration and degeneration of human spirituality from the in- itial stage of man's religious life characterized by the belief in the High God. According to him, this purest belief existed initially also among the pastoral and patriarchally oriented peoples of Central Asia, but their religion can no longer be called as genuine as that of the "primal culture" peoples because it has been inevitably</page><page sequence="9">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 223 exposed to the historical process of spiritual degeneration. The celestial structure of Central Asian religion has been especially con- taminated by shamanism, whose historical and spiritual basis is deeply rooted in what Schmidt calls primary culture (Primdrkultur) of Southeast Asia, which is characterized by primitive gardening, "matriarchy," and the phenomenon of possession.31 As we may note, disagreements between Eliade and Schmidt concerning white and black shamanism are closely linked with the different ways in which they understand the phenomenon of shamanic ecstasy. Ecstasy and Possession Most of students in shamanism would agree that the phenomenon of ecstasy is constitutive for shamanism. As Dominik Schr6der has aptly said, "without ecstasy there is no shamanism.1"32 As a matter of fact, ecstasy is not only an indispens- able part of shamanism, but constitutes also its core; it is the phenomenon of ecstasy that integrates the various elements of beliefs (e.g., beliefs in the heavenly gods and a variety of spirits, good and evil, etc.), myths (cosmology and cosmogony), and ceremonies accompanied by the shamanic costume and drum, into a coherent whole of shamanism. In this sense, it is crucially impor- tant to see how the concept of ecstasy is defined by students of shamanism. And here again, we find that Eliade and Schmidt have given it different interpretations. According to Schmidt, the phenomenon of ecstasy is the criterion by which to judge true or false shamanism. In his view, there is par- tial imperfect ecstasy, and there is perfect ecstasy.'Imperfect ecstasy is what is found in white shamans; they do not achieve perfect ecstasy. What we find in them is merely an artificial ecstasy, a fake, an imitation, that is not accompanied by the loss of consciousness; it is somewhat like the heightened spiritual state which may be experienced by an actor when he plays a role on the stage.33 In Schmidt's opinion, perfect ecstasy is found only in black shamanism, and often also in black-white shamans. What characterizes perfect ecstasy is the complete loss of consciousness, and it is accompanied by epileptic seizures or convulsions; it may</page><page sequence="10">224 Manabu Waida be called the phenomenon of possession, in which state the self of the black shaman is replaced by another self of supernatural quality.34 Schmidt maintains that the white shaman never arrives at this sort of loss of consciousness because he never acquires the over- whelming spiritual experience that may correspond to that of the black shaman, i.e., the awe-inspiring fear and trembling which the black shaman experiences when he is possessed by subterranean spirits or when he travels to the underworld. No contact with the good spirits of heaven can create in the white shaman's psyche such an overwhelming experience and, by extension, perfect ecstasy involving the loss of consciousness.35 Therefore, Schmidt asserts, the white shaman is not a true shaman but simply a Himmelsdiener. Accordingly, white shamanism has nothing to do with the genuine expression of ecstasy whereas black shamanism is characterized by the authentic phenomenon of ecstasy, and this ecstasy is interpreted by Schmidt either as possession, or as the spiritual journey to the underworld. The element of ecstasy is equally fundamental to shamanism, as viewed by Eliade. As he puts it, shamanism is a complex of archaic techniques of ecstasy. This ecstasy is defined by Eliade as a tem- porary abandonment of the body by the soul of the shaman, and he links the shaman's ecstasy with his soul's journey to the world beyond; for him, the phenomenon of possession is qualitatively different from ecstasy and of secondary significance: It is true that "possession" is an archaic and universal phenomenon, but we see no reason to draw the conclusion that the experience of possession pre- ceded the experience of ecstasy. On the contrary, it is understandable how ''possession " could develop from an ecstatic experience: while the soul (or the "principal soul") of the shaman was on its voyage in the higher or lower worlds, "spirits" could take possession of his body. It is difficult to imagine an inverse process; for, once the spirits have taken possession of the shaman, the personal ecstasy-that is, his soul's ascension to heaven or its descension to the underworld-is precluded. In that case, it is the "spirits" that entail and crystallize the religious experience by their "possession."36 In Eliade's opinion, the shaman's ecstatic journey to the world beyond can take, theoretically, three different directions: (1) the as- cent to the heavenly zones; (2) the descent to the underworld; and (3) the spiritual journey to distant space. But, practically, Eliade tends to equate the shaman's ecstatic journey to the beyond with his</page><page sequence="11">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 225 flight towards heaven, regarding the other two cosmic journeys as of secondary order. The reason is obvious: according to him, it is the ecstatic flight towards heaven that constitutes the essence of the classical form of shamanism, which is white shamanism. As Eliade has succinctly put it, le trait caractiristique du chamanisme-trait qui le distingue des autres techniques magico-religieuses-est 'ascension "extatique" du chaman au ciel.37 This specific aspect of ecstatic expe- rience is of paramount importance to Eliade because he views the shaman as one who knows how to restore, and does restore indeed to the present in concreto that primeval paradisal era when com- munications between heaven and earth were possible. It is very likely for this reason that Eliade puts primary emphasis on ecstasy, more specifically, ecstatic flight towards heaven rather than on the phenomenon of possession. To him, ecstasy and possession are quite different states. Shamanic Ecstasy and the Spirits The problem of shamanic ecstasy can be pursued further in dif- ferent ways. But, phenomenologically speaking, shamanic ecstasy, and more particularly, shamanic ecstasy in its Central Asian and Siberian form is inseparably connected with the activities of a variety of spirits. According to the beliefs of the Central Asian and Siberian peoples, the shaman receives his calling from the spirits, undergoes a process of initiatory trials by the spirits (such as the dismember- ment of the flesh and the reduction of the body to the bones, fol- lowed by the renewal of the internal organs), and with the aid of the spirits he sets out for the ecstatic journey to the heavenly zones or the underworld. In view of this, one may agree with Ivar Paulson when he states that the spirits with which the shaman has to deal in his vocation play an absolutely central role in shamanism.38 As a matter of fact, the significance of spirits for the shamanic vocation is such that, to use the words of Ake Hultkrantz, "no description of shamanism is complete which does not take into account the part played by the shaman's auxiliary spirits."39 There are different categories of spirits in the world of the shamans, the most prominent of which are the following: (1) the</page><page sequence="12">226 Manabu Waida spirit of the dead ancestral shaman; (2) the spirit of the wild animal; (3) the tutelary spirit, also known as the shaman's Hauptgeist (Friedrich); and (4) the evil spirit. The shaman enters into contact with at least these four types of spirits. It is well known that a shaman is at once medicine man, priest, and psychopomp; as a medicine man he cures sicknesses, he fulfills priestly functions when he conducts the ceremony of sacrifice (e.g., the horse sacrifice among the Altaic peoples), and as a psychopomp he escorts the souls of the dead to the netherworld. The shaman is able to fulfill this threefold function because he knows the techniques of falling into ecstasy, and that in itself clearly indicates that he knows how to deal with a variety of spirits. It should be noted that each of these spirits is an entity categorically different from any others; the spirit of the ancestral shaman is typologically different from the spirit of the wild animal which, in turn, is distinguishable from the tutelary spirit. The spirit of the ancestral shaman plays a decisive role when a new shaman is "elected" or "chosen" for the shamanic vocation. This does not mean, of course, that the future shaman is always chosen by the spirits of his ancestral shamans. He can be chosen, for instance, by the heavenly gods who reveal their will through the stones falling from the sky, or by striking him with lightning. But the intervention of such heavenly gods in the shamanic election is far less frequent than that of the spirits of ancestral shamans, whose decisive role in this matter is clearly documented in a considerable number of autobiographical stories of Siberian shamans. For in- stance, the Tungus shaman Ivan Cholko states that before a man becomes shaman he is sick for a long time, his head being in a state of confusion. The spirits of the dead shamans come, cut his flesh in pieces, and drink his blood. They also cut off his head and throw it into a caldron, where various iron pieces are forged for his shamanic costume.40 According to another Tungus shaman, a man cannot become shaman if there is no shaman in his clan; only that person who has shaman-ancestors in the past can expect to receive the gift of shamanizing. Before this Tungus shaman started his vocation, he was sick for a whole year; his limbs swelled and he often lost consciousness. He usually recovered from this illness when he began to ''sing.'' Then his ancestors, i.e., the spirits of his</page><page sequence="13">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 227 shaman-ancestors, came and initiated him. They let him stand up like a tree, and pierced him with arrows until he lost consciousness. They cut his flesh in pieces and ate them raw, and tore his bones and counted them; if even one of the bones had been missing, he could not have become a shaman. Finally, the spirits drank the blood of a reindeer and gave it also to him to drink. During this operation he went for a whole summer without eating or drinking.41 A Buriat shaman, Mikhail Stepanov, tells: Before a man becomes shaman he is sick for a long time. Then the spirits of his dead shaman-ancestors come and teach him. When they come, he becomes absent-minded, speaking with them as if with living per- sons. Nobody except him is able to see the spirits. On many occa- sions one comes, sometimes more, frequently many, almost all of them are dead shaman-ancestors. They torture him, strike him, and cut his flesh in pieces with knives. During this operation the future shaman remains there half dead; the beating of his heart is scarcely heard, his breathing weak, and his face and hands are dark blue.42 Another Buriat shaman speaks of the ascent of the shaman's soul to the heavenly zone. Before a man becomes shaman, the spirits of his ancestral shamans carry his soul up to heaven in front of the "Assembly of the Saaytani," and there he is instructed. When the instruction is over, they cook his flesh in order that he may become "mature." During this operation the shaman remains half dead for seven days. On this occasion his relatives (only men) come to him and sing, "Our shaman is returning to life and he will help us!" While the shaman's flesh is cut in pieces and cooked by the spirits of his shaman-ancestors, no stranger may touch it.43 According to the Yakut shaman Sofron Sateyev, when a man is to become shaman he must undergo a special ceremony, i.e., the dismemberment of the body. It is the spirits of his dead shaman- ancestors which cut his flesh in pieces; he "dies" and lies in his yurt for three or four days. He goes without eating and drinking.44 Another Yakut shaman, Pyotr Ivanov, gives further details about this initiatory ordeal of dismemberment, followed by the renewal of the body. His limbs are removed and disjointed with an iron hook by the spirits of his ancestral shamans; the bones are cleaned, the flesh scraped, the body fluids thrown away, and the eyes torn away from their sockets. After this operation all the bones are gathered</page><page sequence="14">228 Manabu Waida up, joined together with iron, and new eyes are put in place. Thus he is transformed into a shaman by the spirits.45 All these fascinating stories amply illustrate that a man can become shaman only after undergoing terrifying but transformative psychic experiences of death and renewal, namely, the dismember- ment of the flesh and the reduction of the body to the bones, fol- lowed by the renewal of the internal organs. At the same time, they clearly show how deeply the spirits of the dead ancestral shamans are involved in the making of future shamans. There is, in fact, a reciprocal relationship between the shaman and the spirits of his shaman-ancestors; the spirits are in need of him, and the future shaman needs help from them to fulfill his vital functions in the community in which he lives. Once a shaman dies, the spirits of his ancestral shamans lose their "abode" so to speak, and eagerly search for a new "master" (a future shaman) until they find him.46 If that person is not willing to become a shaman, they will torture him with the various kinds of sicknesses until he agrees, and then once he agrees and starts shamanizing, he is cured.4" The wandering of ancestral spirits in search for a new shaman may be taken to mean that these representatives of the world of the spirits are anxious to establish and maintain, in the person of the new shaman, a connecting link with the world of living beings. In this sense, we may say that the shaman is an intermediary between this world of the living humans and the world of the spirits, which are specifically represented here by the spirits of the dead shaman- ancestors. The concept of community, as understood by the Cen- tral Asian and Siberian peoples, is much broader and more com- prehensive in scope than ours; it embraces both the living and the dead, this world and the world beyond, and on the borderline between the two worlds stands the shaman as a link, as a mediator. While the spirits of the ancestral shamans are in need of him, the shaman is also in need of them because it is believed that each of these spirits of shaman-ancestors owns a certain number of spirits of wild animals and birds, which are essential for the shaman's ecstatic journey to the world beyond. These spirits of wild animals and birds are given to a future shaman by the spirits of his ancestral shamans when he is "elected" or "chosen" by them. This means that the more ancestral shamans he has, the more spirits of wild</page><page sequence="15">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 229 animals or birds he will have, and thus he will become a more powerful shaman. It is precisely in this context that we may under- stand the remark of the Tungus shaman, mentioned above, that "a man cannot become shaman if there is no shaman in his clan." Of course, one may become a shaman of his own free will even if he has no shamanic family background. But, such a "self-made" shaman is usually considered weak because he has virtually no chance of being chosen by the spirits of ancestral shamans which usually possess, at least, a few spirits of wild animals and birds. Moreover, such a weak shaman often lacks an inner psychic ex- perience of vital importance, i.e., the experience of having his flesh cut in pieces and his body reduced to the bones. According to a Yakut shaman, "small insignificant shamans are not cut in pieces; only a great shaman, who has a series of shaman-ancestors in his clan, undergoes the initiation of dismemberment."'48 The great shaman usually has his own tutelary spirit, variously known as /ii-kyl (the so-called "animal mother" or Tiermutter) among the Yakuts and the Dolgans, tyn-bura among the Teleuts of the Altai, or ayami among the Goldi. This spirit, theriomorphic in structure, also plays a role for the making of the shaman. It may ap- pear, for instance, in the form of a dog, but the more powerful one appears as a bull, a colt, a bear, an elk, or an eagle.49 The Yakuts have the tradition that the tutelary spirit, appearing as an "animal mother" (i.e., ijdi-kyl), escorts the soul of the future shaman to the underworld. She has an appearance of a great bird (sometimes eagle) with an iron beak, hooked claws, and a long tail. She shows herself to a future shaman three times: at his birth, at his shamanic initiation, and finally at his death. Especially interesting is the way she treats him at the time of his initiation. The "animal mother" guides his soul down to the underworld, leaving it on the ninth and highest branch of a pitch pine (the so-called Schamanenbaum, also considered here as the Cosmic Tree) until it reaches maturity. Then, finding the soul matured, she brings it back to earth and pro- ceeds to cut his flesh in pieces and scatters them on all the "roads of sickness and death," giving all of them to evil spirits which cause sickness and death. Each one of the evil spirits devours the part of the future shaman's flesh that is his share; according to the Yakuts, this gives the future shaman the power to cure the corresponding</page><page sequence="16">230 Manabu Waida sicknesses. The evil spirits depart after devouring his whole flesh. Finally, the "animal mother" restores his bones to their proper places, and the future shaman wakes up as from a deep sleep.50 Among the Goldi the tutelary spirit, ayami, can take human forms, not to say animal forms. According to a Goldi shaman, it was when he was asleep on his sick-bed that the tutelary spirit ap- proached him as a very beautiful woman to choose him as a shaman. She said, "I am the ayami of your ancestors, the shamans. I taught them shamaning. Now I am going to teach you. The old shamans have died off, and there is no one to heal people. You are to become a shaman." But, she comes to him sometimes in the form of an old woman. Of course, she can also manifest herself in animal forms; she appears sometimes as a wolf, and sometimes as a winged tiger. The Goldi shaman rides on the tiger when he makes ecstatic journeys in the heavens. He also relates that the tutelary spirit has given him three "assistants"-the panther, the bear, and the tiger. "They come to me in my dreams," he says, "and appear whenever I summon them while shamaning. If one of them refuses to come, the ayami makes them obey. ...When I am shamaning, the ayami and the assistant spirits are possessing me."51 These stories clearly show that the tutelary spirit is typologically distinguishable from the spirit of the dead ancestral shaman on one hand, and from the spirit of the wild animal (discussed below) on the other. The difference between the tutelary spirit and the spirit of the ancestral shaman is suggested by the account of the Goldi shaman that it is the ayami who "chose" his ancestors as shamans. The tutelary spirit is different also from the spirit of the wild animal although they are both theriomorphic in structure. Two obvious differences may be noted here. In the first place, the tutelary spirit "elects" or "chooses" a man for the shamanic vocation, and sub- jects him to a series of initiatory trials, thereby transforming him in- to a shaman. The tutelary spirit, as well as the spirit of the ancestral shaman, is responsible for the making of the shaman. By contrast, the spirit of the wild animal is apparently not involved in this pro- cess, but enters into contact with a shaman only after he has become such, and at the time he sets out for the ecstatic journey to the world beyond. And secondly, the tutelary spirit is higher in rank than the spirits of wild animals, emerging as their master or lord. This point</page><page sequence="17">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 231 is well made by the Goldi shaman, who says that the spirits of wild animals (such as the panther, the bear, and the tiger) stand under control of the tutelary spirit, serving the shaman as "assistant spirits." The spirits of wild animals, variously known as "helping spirits," "guardian spirits," or "assistant spirits," are equally im- portant for the shamanic vocation. They are indispensable to the shaman when he sets out for the spiritual journey to the world beyond. The purpose of his ecstatic journeys as a shaman is mainly threefold: (1) to bring the soul of the sacrificed animal to heaven and offer it to the heavenly gods; (2) to lead the soul of the dead to his new dwelling place in the netherworld; and (3) to search for the lost soul of the sick in heaven, in distant space, and most frequently in the underworld. The shaman is engaged in the ecstatic journey most often when he has to cure the sick.52 One of the most interesting pieces of information we have about this shamanic activity comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks. Healing requires two ecstatic journeys. The first of the two journeys is more of a rapid survey. It is during the second, which ends in trance, that the shaman enters deep into the beyond. The seance begins, as usual, with the invocation of the spirits, the spirits of his ancestral shamans and those of wild animals or birds that are to serve as his assistants. The spirits come into his drum one after the other. Dur- ing all this time the shaman sings and dances. When the spirits have come, and we may suppose that some of them have intruded into his body, he begins to leap; this means that he has left the earth and is rising toward the clouds. At a certain moment he cries: "I am high in the air, I see the Yenisei a hundred versts away." On the way he meets other spirits and tells the audience whatever he sees. Then, addressing the spirit of the bird carrying him through the air, he cries: "O my little fly, rise still higher, I want to see far- ther!..." Soon afterwards he returns to the yurt, surrounded by his spirits. It seems that he has not found the patient's soul, but he has seen it at a great distance, in the land of the dead. To reach it, he starts dancing again until trance supervenes. Still carried by the spirits of wild animals or birds, his soul leaves his body and enters the beyond, from which he finally returns with the patient's soul.53 This account is noteworthy for at least three reasons: (1) it is</page><page sequence="18">232 Manabu Waida believed by the Yenisei Ostiaks as well as many other peoples in Central Asia and Siberia that sickness is caused by the loss of the soul, hence the shaman undertakes the ecstatic journey to get it back from the hands of evil spirits in the underworld; (2) the Yenisei Ostiak shaman is involved in two genuine ecstatic journeys, one heavenly and the other subterranean; and (3) to make the ecstatic journeys, he summons not only the spirits of his ancestral shamans but also the spirits of wild animals and birds. The ecstatic journey, whether heavenly or subterranean, is believed to be a long and difficult one, so the shaman needs help from the spirits of wild animals. These spirits appear in diverse forms: bears, wolves, reindeer, hares and, of course, various kinds of birds (especially the goose, eagle, owl, crow, and so on). They come to help a shaman from the various cosmic zones together with his own tutelary spirit and the spirits of his shaman-ancestors as he beats his drum to summon them. The spirits enter his body, inspir- ing him. Otherwise, they move into his drum. It is also said that they sit on his shamanic costume. This is precisely when the phenomenon of shamanic ecstasy takes place, then the shaman is transformed into a spiritual being, and his free-soul leaves his body for the ecstatic journey to the world beyond, accompanied by the spirits. We are inclined to the view, then, that phenomenologically speaking, shamanic ecstasy is closely linked, in the belief of the Central Asian and Siberian peoples, with the phenomenon of intru- sion of the shaman's physical body by the spirits of wild animals or birds.54 Dominik Schr6der is certainly right when he asserts that shamanism as the techniques of ecstasy is essentially a technique of transformation.55 There is no question that when the spirits of wild animals or birds come to a shaman as helping spirits, enter him, and inspire him, then he is transformed into a spiritual being capable of the ecstatic flight. Our question, however, is whether Schr6der is justified in interpreting this phenomenon of intrusion and its concomitant transformation in terms of possession. The same question may be directed also to Hans Findeisen when he states: Die von ihm (Eliade) behauptete scharfe Trennung zwischen Ekstase im Sinne von Heraustreten aus der Leiblichkeit und "Besessenheit" = unmit-</page><page sequence="19">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 233 telbare psychische Beeinflussung durch Ahnengeister usw., lisst sich niimlich fiberhaupt nicht ohne Vergewaltigung des tatsachlich komplexen Charakters der schamanischen Traditionen durchfiihren, zumal wenn man bedenkt, dass dem Schamanen eine Himmels- oder Unterweltsreise nur dann m6glich ist, wenn irgendwelche Geister - mindestens erstmalig - in ihn eingedrungen waren und seine Seele zu den erwiihnten Reisen von der K6rperlichkeit befreit hatten. Ganz zutreffend sagt demgegenfiber Schr6der, dass die Seele den Schritt fiber die Schwelle nur tun kann, wenn ein ausserseelisches Gegenilber aus dem Jenseits ihr hierzu behilflich ist. "Ekstase" im engeren Sinne des "Heraustretens," d.h. im Sinne von Eliade, ist also von gleichzeitiger, zumindest einmal friiher stattgehabter Besessenheit - wir haben hierbei die Typik der schamanischen Erlebnisse im Auge - abhangig, wie auch beim einzelnen Schamanen immer wieder reine Ekstase (Himmels- oder Unterweltsreise) mit ausgesprochener "Besessenheit" durch Ahnengeister usw. ohne Exkursionserlebnisse abwechseln.56 Findeisen rightly points out the close relationship that exists be- tween shamanic ecstasy and the phenomenon of intrusion, but in- trusion should not be confused with possession. It is true that shamans are sometimes found to be possessed, but these are simply exceptional cases for which there is a particular explanation that he has been enfeebled because of sicknesses. The "possessed" shamans, however, can no longer function properly as shamans.57 As Shirokogoroff has aptly said, "Saman is a person (male and female) who knows the art of possessing spirits in order to control these spirits in the interest of other people; saman is the spirits' master. "58 His view has been basically accepted by Adolf Friedrich and Ivar Paulson. According to Friedrich, when the shaman has been entered by the spirit of a bird, he is inspired; his soul leaves his body, his essence being transformed into the bird whose spirit has entered him. However, this does not mean that he is possessed, he is still able to freely discharge the spirit from him. In his opinion, the shaman is essentially that special kind of religious genius who is able to freely control the spirits approaching him.59 Paulson is equally emphatic in asserting that "intrusion" and "possession" are two qualitatively different phenomena. Even when the shaman takes spirits into himself, he still maintains his own personal integri- ty; he is the master of the spirits, not their slave or passive tool as is usually the case with the spiritualistic medium.60 At any rate, shamanic ecstasy is inseparably linked with the phenomenon of in- trusion of the shaman's body by the spirits of wild animals or birds, but it ought to be clearly distinguished from the phenomenon of possession.</page><page sequence="20">234 Manabu Waida Perhaps in this connection, attention may be paid (though brief- ly) to the shamanic costume, the design of which assumes the form of wild animals or birds. As Harva has shown, it may be classified generally into three major types: (1) the "bird" type; (2) the "reindeer" type; and (3) the "bear" type.61 This is a good indica- tion that wild animals or birds are concretely represented even in the shaman's costume. But the term "representation" might perhaps not be appropriate to refer to the psychic state that the shaman experiences during his ecstatic journey to the world beyond. Both Eliade and Friedrich rightly stress that the shaman, wearing such a costume and holding and beating a drum in his hand, is transformed in his inner experience into an animal, whether it is a bird, a reindeer, or a bear. "The shaman," Eliade states, "turns himself into an animal just as he achieves a similar result by putting on an animal mask. Or, again, we might speak of a new identity for the shaman, who becomes an animal-spirit, and speaks, sings, or flies like the animals and birds."62 Once the shaman has become an "animal" or "bird" himself, it is believed that he is able to understand the language of animals which is, of course, one of the secrets belonging to the shamanic vocation.63 There is virtually no doubt then that the spiritual milieu of shamanism in Central Asia and Siberia can duly be looked for in the archaic culture of hunters, in what Findeisen has called the Tierschicht in human history64 although it has also been exposed to the influence of agrarian cultures in the south. What then is the religious world of the Central Asian and Siberian peoples? It is preeminently the world of the spirits. In their view, the human world is in constant danger of attack by numerous evil spirits causing sickness and death and is, in fact, actually at- tacked by them. If there is one person who is powerful enough to defend the human world against them, it is the shaman who is acquainted with a variety of spirits. He is the virtuoso in the world of the spirits. He "knows" the ways and strategies of the evil spirits causing sickness and death, and he alone is endowed with the capacity to "see" the spirits. Moreover, in order to defend the human world he is able to become a spiritual being himself and undertake the ecstatic journey in the three cosmic zones. He is able to fight triumphant battles against evil spirits precisely because he</page><page sequence="21">Problems of Central Asian and Siberian Shamanism 235 can expect to obtain the necessary help from the spirits of his ancestral shamans, from his tutelary spirit, and from the spirits of animals and birds. In this sense, human life is viewed as a kind of battleground where good spirits and evil spirits are engaged in ongoing fights for existence. It is hardly surprising that the people of Central Asia and Siberia have, in general, been receptive to the message of the Iranian religions colored by a dualism, which depicts the setting of human history as a battleground between the oppos- ing forces of good and evil.

Trask ("Bol- lingen Series," LXXVI; New York, 1964), which has since remained the standard work on shamanism in the English-speaking world. Eliade has discussed the phenomenon of shamanism in the whole history of religions, not confining himself to shamanism in its Central Asian and Siberian form.

In the Balagansk district, for instance, the can- didate, seated on a felt carpet, is carried nine times around each of the nine birch trees, climbs it, and makes nine turns at its top. The materials of fundamental im- portance were presented by N. N. Agapitov and M. N. Khangalov in an essay, "Materials for the Study of Shamanism in Siberia" (in Russian, 1883). On the basis of this essay, as well as V. M. Mikhailowski, "Shamanism in Siberia and European Russia" (Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 24, 1894, pp. 62-100, 126-58), pp. 87-90, Western students of shamanism such as U. Harva, M. Eliade, W. Schmidt, and H. Findeisen have written on the Buriat initiation ceremony. See Harva, Die religioisen Vorstellungen, pp. 487-98; Eliade, Shamanism, pp. 115-22; Schmidt, Ursprung 10 (1952): 399-422; Findeisen, Schamanentum, pp. 70-79. 22 The unusual complexity of the Buriat rite of shamanic initiation becomes clear when it is compared with others known to us in Central Asia and Siberia. In his discussion of this subject, Eliade mentions the following peoples: the Tungus of Transbaikalia and of Manchuria, the Manchu, the Yakuts, the Samoyeds and the Ostiaks (discussed together), the Goldi, and the Buriats (Shamanism, pp. 11 f.). Strikingly, little is known of the ceremony among the peoples in the northeastern part of Siberia such as the Yukagir, the Koryak, the Chukchee, and the Kam- chadal; the documentation is almost entirely limited to the peoples in southern Central Asia. Moreover, even among these Central Asian peoples we have no satisfactory data except among the Buriats, whose initiation ceremony for the shaman is well documented. It is true that, according to Harva, ceremonies similar to those among the Buriats are known among "the Sibo (a people related to the Tungus), the Tatars of the Altai and, to some extent, also the Yakuts and the Goldi" (Die religio'sen Vorstellungen, p. 498). But Harva mentions it without giving further details, and Eliade is familiar with Harva's report (Shamanism, p. 120). Consequently, we may conclude that no detailed and satisfactory information is available on the public rite of shamanic initiation other than that of the Buriats. 23 Mikhailowski, "Shamanism in Siberia and European Russia," pp. 89-90. 24 Harva, Die religiosen Vorstellungen, pp. 492ff.; Eliade, Shamanism, pp. 121-22. 25 Findeisen, Schamanentum, pp. 77ff.

The shaman's life and death are so dependent on those of his Tiermutter that this spirit has sometimes been interpreted as the Seele des Schamanen (Harva), and sometimes as his alter ego (Friedrich). It is this alter ego, tutelary spirit, that is "animated" in the ceremony for "animating the drum." When this spirit enters a shaman, he is transformed into the spirit himself.

In other words, the shaman's priestly function is mostly regulated in accordance with the cycle of the seasons. As to his ecstatic journey to the land of the dead as a psychopomp, it is so dangerous that he tries it only on rare occasions. See Shirokogoroff, "Versuch," p. 77. 53 Eliade, Shamanism, p. 223, drawing on Ake Ohlmarks, Studien zum Problem des Schamanismus, p. 184. 54 We may keep in mind, in this connection, that shamanic ecstasy can take on different external appearances and exhibit various depths. As Hultkrantz has remarked, it swings "between frenzy and hilarious rapture on one hand, death-like comatose passivity on the other, and a mild inspirational light trance in between.... Shamanism is always associated with ecstasy, but the degree of this ecstasy is not fixed." Hultkrantz, "A Definition of Shamanism," p. 28. See also his "Ecological and Phenomenological Aspects of Shamanism," pp. 41ff. 55 Schr6der, "Zur Struktur des Schamanismus," p. 862. According to him, shamanism as the technique of transformation embraces "not only the phenomenon of possession underestimated by Eliade, but also the heavenly journey underestimated by Schmidt." "They are," he states, "not contrasts but two aspects of one and the same reality." 56 Findeisen, Schamanentum, p. 237. 57 Shirokogoroff, "Versuch," p. 96. 58 N. D. Mironov and S. M. Shirokogorov, "Sramana-Shaman: Etymology of the Word 'Shaman,' " Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, North-China Branch 55 (1924), 115. See also Shirokogoroff, "Versuch," pp. 50, 55, 59-60, 94-95.
