<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSERVATIONS ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MARSUPIAL SETONIX BRACHYURUS (QUOY AND GAIMARD) IN AN ENCLOSURE WAYNE C. PACKER ABSTRACT.-Observations on the behavior of the small macropod marsupial, Setonix brachyurus (Quoy and Gaimard), from Rottnest Island were made on five males and five females in an enclosure. S. brachyurus is nocturnal with peaks of activity at dusk and before dawn. The males were aggressive toward one another and became organized into a linear hierarchy with the dominant male sometimes holding a territory. All the animals showed localization in their movements probably homologous with the home range behavior of free-living forms. There was little evidence suggesting a hierarchy among the females. Observed behavior patterns are described, including aggressive and non- aggressive interactions, sexual and sleeping behavior and patterns of competition and utilization of food resources. Comparison is made with the behavior of free- living animals where possible. The quokka, Setonix brachyurus (Quoy and Gaimard), is a macropod marsupial indigenous to Western Australia. Although considerable work has been done on its ecology, physiology and growth, little is known of its behavior. Because it is relatively small, is nocturnal, and inhabits low but often dense vegetation, direct observation of free-living animals is extremely difficult (Packer, 1965). The quokka moves about over an area of several acres (Holsworth, 1967), and it is impossible to observe any particular in- dividual for an extended period. On Rottnest Island, the quokka population is divided to some extent into sub-populations (Holsworth, op. cit.), the members of which are rarely observed to exhibit any form of conspecific agonistic behavior. Fighting does occur, however, at least between sexually mature males in the breeding season, as evidenced by the large percentage with tor ears. Other types of wounding are seldom seen. These observations suggest that some sort of social organization functions to reduce the level of intra-specific aggressive- ness. Because of the difficulties outlined above, it was decided to establish a small confined population on the mainland in order to look for indications of any social organization in this species and to describe any other patterns of behavior that could be identified so as to have a better basis for in- terpreting field observations. This technique has been used successfully by a number of authors in studies on eutherian mammals and by Stodart (1966) on the marsupial Bettongia lesueuri. METHODS AND MATERIALS Five male and five female Setonix brachyurus were collected on Rottnest Island near Perth, Western Australia, on 29 November 1966. The sites of capture were sufficiently distant from one another that within each sex the members were unlikely to be 8</page><page sequence="2">PACKER-BEHAVIOR OF SETONIX A FIG. 1.-Map of enclosure used in this study: X, Eucalyptus gomphocephala; E, Erythrina indica; 0, tree stumps; L, floodlights; FP, food pans; W, water troughs; S, artificial shelters: O.P., observation platform.

The females had all carried young the previous breeding season as judged by teat condition and were not due to come into oestrus for another month to 6 weeks (Sharman, 1955a). Two of these females died a few weeks later and were replaced by two more from the departmental breeding colony. The place of origin on the island of the latter animals is unknown, but they came from separate holding yards and were, therefore, unacquainted. The animals were marked with individually distinctive collars and the males referred to as M1 to M5, and similarly the females as Fl to F5. They were taken to the mainland the day after capture, and the males were released at sunset into the study yard at the Zoology Department. The females were housed in individual pens and introduced into the study yard en masse on 11 February 1967. The project was terminated on 12 March 1967. The study enclosure was roughly rectangular in shape with an area of approximately 11,000 square feet. Fig. 1 is a map of the enclosure and shows the position of the trees, mainly tuart, Eucalyptus gomphocephala, with a single flame tree, Erythrina indica; floodlights; food pans; water troughs; and the observation platform. In addition to the shade and protection offered by the trees, five galvanized iron shelters approximately 2 by 2 by 2 feet, open on the side facing the observer were provided. All nocturnal ob- servations were made from a 5-foot high platform located outside the north fence. The general activity of the animals was easily visible in the relatively weak floodlighting (a total of 1100 watts of illumination was used). A head-torch and binoculars were used as required. The yard lights were on all night when observations were to be made and for the three preceding nights.

The animals did eat fallen leaves in addition to the enriched chaff mixture provided in food pans. The total time spent watching was 49.5 hours spread over 29 nights. With 30 November 1966 designated night 1, watches were made on nights 1 through 4, 13-16, 27-30, 57-60, 70, 72-78, 83-84, 86-88, and 100-103. Most of the observation periods were between sunset and midnight, but on five occasions watches were mounted for a 2-hour period centered on dawn. No systematic observations were made during the day except that the position of each animal and whether it was awake or asleep was recorded on 40 mornings at about 0800 hours. On day 45, a 10-foot square enclosure was installed in the yard at the position indicated by the broken lines near the upper center of Fig. 1. A large food hopper (FP5) was placed in the northeastern corner of this enclosure and a water trough in the south- western corner. The other food pans (FP1 to 4) were removed and the two regular water troughs were covered. Access to this small enclosure was through narrow openings on the east and west sides, and these were fitted with switches that re- corded every entry or exit on an Esterline-Angus Event Recorder. During the ob- servation periods on nights 57 through 61, these switches were temporarily discon- nected and replaced by a series of manual controls on the observation platform, which enabled me to record the time spent by each individual animal in this feeding area as well as the actual amount of time at (or in) the food hopper. The study yard was returned to its initial condition on day 62. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Interactions Male with male.-Males were initially released into the yard at 1930 hours and ob- served until midnight on night 1. They did not move about as widely as expected to explore the yard (see discussion beyond concerning home range and territoriality), and no interactions occurred. On night 2 only five interactions were observed in 21/2 hours and only two encounters were seen during the dawn watch that night. There were eight interactions recorded in 21/2 hours on night 3 and 14 in 2 hours on night 4. This latter figure probably reflects the maximum rate of interaction involving actual physical contact for the entire period until the females were placed in the yard on night 74. The general pattern of overt aggressiveness, independent of the presence of females, can be divided into four phases, following any one of which contact may be broken off. Phase I: sniffing-two animals slowly approach one another, usually head on, stand with fore- paws firmly on the ground slightly in front of the shoulders and the rear part of the body somewhat elevated, and look as if they are sniffing each other's nose, although they never touch (Fig. 2a); except that the hind feet are parallel, the position is reminiscent of that adopted by a sprint runner immediately before the starting gun is 10 Vol. 50, No. 1</page><page sequence="4">PACKER-BEHAVIOR OF SETONIX TABLE 1.-Dominance hierarchy in male Setonix brachyurus, showing frequency of times each male was domirnant in all observed interactions, and the per cent of "wins" for each animal.

Phase II: cuffing-the animals shift their weight to their back legs, stand more erect, although not vertically, and cuff one another with their forepaws about the head and shoulders (Fig. 2b). Phase III: vigorous fighting-the precise pattern of movements is difficult to follow because it is so rapid, lasts only a few seconds, and is quite variable; biting and kicking with the hind legs occurs, and one animal usually comes out on top and ends up with its hands full of hair torn from the back of the other. Phase IV: chase- when one animal breaks off contact at whatever point, he is ususally but not always pursued briefly by the other; sometimes in a particularly violent interaction the latter animal will catch up and attempt to jump onto the back of the fleeing individual while both are in full flight. The locomotion of both individuals at these times is always bipedal, the hind feet being used in unison, but the leaps are short and low with the vertebral column remaining essentially horizontal. Only if one individual attempts to jump on top of the other will the feet of either be more than 5 to 6 inches off the ground. In these inter- actions the individual that fled from the encounter was interpreted as being subordinate to the other. The number of instances of overt aggressiveness involving actual physical contact de- clined with time. Simple avoidance took the place of fighting, but since there was no clearly evident threat or submissive posturing, it was impossible to identify all such instances. Most of the avoidance responses that clearly indicated social position occurred at or near food pans; the feeding animal would stop eating, look toward any other animal heard aproaching, and then either leave or resume feeding. If the animal left, this was interpreted as a subordinate response. Avoidance also apparently occurred when two individuals were moving across the yard on generally converging courses and one would turn away. The latter was considered subordinate. On these criteria the dominant/subordinate relationship was established during the first few days and continued throughout the period of study independently of the presence of females. The dominance relationship established was a linear hierarchy. Initially the order from most dominant to most subordinate was M5, M1, M2, M3, M4. Sometime between nights 30 and 57 the relative positions of M2 and M3 reversed, and the order then re- mained M5, Ml, M3, M2, M4 for the rest of the study period. These sequences were originally based on subjective observation, but the latter was substantiated in several ways. A total of 275 interactions was recorded, and these are summarized in Table 1, which shows, for example, that M5 was dominant to Ml on 43 occasions whereas M1 was dominant to M5 only twice. The number of instances of individual reverses in dominance is relatively low, and Table 1 is arranged so that these are all shown above the diagonal line. The column on the right of Table 1, shows the percentage of times each animal was dominant in an interaction. 11 February 1969</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY TABLE 2.-Initial (I.B.W.) and terminal (T.B.W.) body weights of Setonix brachyurus in relation to position in hierarchy.

These trials involved placing the animals, in all possible combinations of two, in a 10 by 10-foot square yard unfamiliar to them all and watching their behavior. Typically a fight occurred and the individual who fled from the encounter was considered the more subordinate of the pair. By scoring the number of wins and losses, the hierarchy was determined. Since this work was designed as a purely observational study, no attempt was made to determine experimentally the causal factors involved in hierarchy position. Neverthe- less, there is some evidence that body weight may have played a role. Table 2 shows the body weights of the males at the beginning and end of the study, arranged in the order of the respective hierarchies, and the changes in weight that occurred. The initial hierarchy corresponds generally with the order of the initial body weights (I.B.W.) except that M2 was 40 grams heavier than M1. This difference is probably not significant, however, in view of possible variation in the contents of the ruminant-like stomach. Apparently coincident with the reversal of positions between M2 and M3 early in the study, the former lost 370 grams compared to its I.B.W., while the latter gained 380 grams. These weight changes are greater than the overall change during the course of the study. The final hierarchy was not as closely related to weight although M5 and M4 were still the extremes in weight as well as social status. The actual order of the terminal body weights was the same as for the I.B.W., even though some had gained and some had lost. Female with female.-Interactions between females were much less vigorous and much less frequent than between males. During the 30 days that females were in the study en- closure only 15 female-with-female interactions were recorded. During the same period 56 male-with-male interactions were noted. Females were commonly observed to be sitting peacefully side-by-side both at the food pans and elsewhere in the yard at night. Except as noted below in discussion of behavior at feeder, this was never the case with males. No organization comparable to the linear hierarchy observed in the males was ex- hibited by the females. A diagrammatic representation of the interactions in the en- closure yielded a series of interconnected triangles. Calculation of the percentage of en- counters in which each individual was dominant gave an order quite different from that obtained in a round-robin pairing trial. This latter trial was of little significance, however, because of the extreme weakness of the interactions; mild cuffing was the only aggressive- ness observed. Consequently there was a large area for error in the subjective interpreta- tion by the observer of which animal was dominant and which subordinate. There was no correlation of social position with body weight, and any influence of the oestrous cycle was either too weak to be noted or else oestrus did not occur during any observation periods (see below). The character of the interactions seemed to differ, in anthropomorphic terms, with the sexes. If the male-with-male behavior could be characterized by the expression: "Get out of here, I'm boss." Female-with-female interactions could be represented by: "Go 12 Vol. 50, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">PACKER-BEHAVIOR OF SETONIX away, you're bothering me." This difference was particularly evident in the round-robin pairings. Male with female.-The period when the sexes were together in the enclosure, 11 February to 13 March, was during the latter part of the normal mating season (Sharman, 1955a). Females had been isolated from contact with males since the date of capture, and it was hoped that mating behavior would occur. Since the oestrous cycle in the quokka is 28 days (Sharman, op. cit.) and the gestation period is about 27 days (Sharman, 1955b), all the females should have come into heat at least once. Copulation was never observed, but it did occur. Four of the females later gave birth to young. It was possible to estimate the age of these (Shield and Woolley, 1961) and extrapolate back in time to determine the approximate date of conception. These conception dates were as follows: F2, 1 March (night 92); F3, 18 February (night 81); F4, 1 March (night 92); F5, 8 March (night 99). Unfortunately, none of these nights was included in any of the ob- servation periods. The most pronounced behavior between sexes consisted of a female apparently sniffing at the chest of a male, sometimes continuing the act most posteriorly. At these times the male stood nearly erect with forelimbs extended forward while the female, also standing bipedally, leaned toward the male. The encounters were generally broken off by the female moving away, often (but not always) followed by the male. Rarely was a male observed to sniff at the genital opening of the female. No attempts at mounting were observed. All the females engaged in this chest sniffing at least once. The object of their attention was most commonly M5, the dominant male, but it also occurred with M1, M2, and M3. At one time or another all four subordinate males evidenced interest in a female that involved some bodily contact, although not the chest sniffing described above, and to which the females evidently objected because they emitted one or two loud squeaks. These vocalizations attracted the dominant male, M5, from wherever he was in the yard. He ran toward the female at full speed, and this was evidently enough to scare the subordinate male away. The female then usually followed M5 back to his territory. On 13 occasions males were seen vigorously chasing females. What caused or preceded these chases was unobserved, but they never ended in any obvious sexual behavior. The males involved were those in the middle of the hierachy. Also 16 instances of females chasing males were recorded. The males chased were always the three most subordinate ones. The females never caught up to the males and no sexual behavior occurred. It seems probable, therefore, that these interactions were related to the general social structure and not directly to reproduction. Behavior at Feeders Under field conditions on Rottnest, quokkas are comparatively inactive during daylight hours when their movements are restricted to the areas used for diurnal shelter. They emerge from these areas around dusk, move about the grassy steppe regions at night and return to shelter at dawn. Their nocturnal movements generally show a bimodal pattern of activity, at least as measured by passages through fence lines (Packer, 1965). These nocturnal movements are interpreted primarily in terms of feeding activity and also, during the summer, the need for potable water. It was not possible with four widely spaced food pans in the study yard to record with any accuracy the individual feeding times, the sequence if any in feeding in relation to hierarchy, or general time of feeding. For this reason, the multiple food and water points were replaced for an 18-day period by a single food hopper and a single water bowl located within a small enclosure (see Fig. 1), which was instrumented to record all entries and exits. This enclosure provided no shelter except for the food hopper in which, on rare occasions, an animal was seen during the day.

Fig. 3 shows the pattern of activity related to this enclosure and data from a free- living population on Rottnest in the period 26 October to 6 December 1963 (Packer, 1965). The data have been transformed and graphed as the per cent of the total activity per hour for the two situations in order to facilitate comparison between grossly different total frequencies. The two curves, although differing in detail, are generally similar. The earlier evening peak in 1963 is clearly related to the earlier time of sunset, but the reason for the difference in the morning peaks is uncertain. The food hopper was large enough to accommodate at least three animals standing shoulder to shoulder. Never more than two were observed to use it simultaneously, however. Table 3 summarizes the utilization of this food point during 12 hours spread over 4 days when precise records were made during observation periods on nights 57 to 61. It shows the frequency for each of the possible pairings, indicating which animal was first to the unoccupied food trough and which other male joined him there. It also shows, between the parallel diagonal lines, the frequency when each animal was the sole user of the feeding point. For example, M5 was the sole user on nine occasions and was joined by M3 twice. The males are arranged in hierarchial order, and this arrangement clearly shows that with only two exceptions a subordinate animal might join one more dominant to himself but not vice versa. Whenever any feeding animal was approached by another male who was higher in the hierarchy, the more subordinate individual im- mediately stopped feeding and moved away from the pan. Once the more dominant animal began eating, the previous animal or some other of lower rank might join him. Overt fighting was never observed in these circumstances. The influence of hierarchy on the utilization of this single feeding point is indicated also by an analysis of the frequency of visits to it as shown by the event recorder and the 14 Vol. 50, No. I</page><page sequence="8">PACKER-BEHAVIOR OF SETONIX TABLE 3.-Utilization of single food point by Setonix brachyurus dluring 12 hours of close observation.

The data are given in Table 3. They demonstrate that, although there was considerable variability in the time spent feeding and no correlation between this and the order of rank, the more dominant individuals spent a greater proportion of their time in the enclosure actually eating and made fewer visits to the enclosure. The dominating in- fluence of M5 is shown by the fact that the average time spent in the enclosure by the remaining animals is in direct relation to their position in the hierarchy. The animals obtained other food in the form of fallen leaves, which were spread widely over the yard throughout the entire study, but it was impossible to even estimate what proportion of their daily diet these constituted or their nutritional quality. The animals appeared to be selective in their choice of leaves even though all seemed to be brown and dry. The behavior of the animals when actually eating also reflected hierarchy. The food hopper was low enough for one or more animals at a time to stand on the ground and reach the food. It was large enough, however, for two animals to climb into it simultaneously and eat while standing on the chaff mixture. The latter was apparently the preferred pattern and that generally adopted by the more dominant of any pair simultaneously using the hopper. The more subordinate individual of any pair rarely climbed in at the same time as the more dominant, but whether in or standing in front of the hopper, he appeared much more alert and wary, frequently stopping to look around as if ready to flee 1 February 1969 15</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY TABLE 4.-Utilization of the area of the enclosure by Setonix brachyurus.

The concept of home range, therefore, is not directly applicable to this study. Nevertheless, restricted utilization of the total area of the enclosure did occur, and this may be at least partially homologous to the field situation. In its extreme manifestation restricted utilization took the form of territoriality, that is the defense of an area. General utilization of the area.-Table 4 summarizes the positions of all of the animals as recorded at 15-minute intervals during the periods of observation. The nights are variously grouped and split for reasons that will be evident below. Although the actual position of each animal was recorded in the original protocol, for the purposes of the table these are tabulated as the frequency of occurrence in the four quarters of the enclosure during the various periods. Since the enclosure was not quite square, the sizes of the quarters vary somewhat, but from the behavioral standpoint this is not important. Lines connecting A-A' and B-B' on the map of the yard (Fig. 1) delimit the quarters or sectors used in this analysis. Vol. 50, No. 1 16</page><page sequence="10">PACKER-BEHAVIOR OF SETONIX Males.-Localization of movement was generally characteristic for the entire period of the study. Even in the first few hours of the first night most of the animals were recorded from only a single sector of the yard, M1 and M5 in the northwest, M2 in the northeast and M4 in the southeast. Only M3 moved around widely, but even in this case the locations tended to be clumped. In a great many instances the frequency of records in the apparently preferred quarter of the yard was at least twice as great as the next highest value. When the frequencies were closer the highest two were generally adjacent; rarely were they diagonally situated. Some of the changes in area of localization and many of the zero frequencies subsequent to night 4 (see Table 4) were the result of territorial behavior on the part of M5. How- ever, even when M5 defended nearly half of the yard (see below), the other males did not spend their time with equal frequency in the remaining two quarters. Females.-The females moved widely about the yard on the first two nights (i.e., 74 and 75) following their introduction. Subsequently they spent most of their time at night in the western half of the yard, although they all made at least brief excursions elsewhere. Their distribution subsequent to night 76 was apparently influenced by the behavior of M5, but was entirely voluntary-that is they were not herded into that area. Territoriality.-M5 was the only animal ever to exhibit territoriality in the sense used by Burt (1943) and others of a defended area. This first became evident on night 15 when M5 actively chased intruders away from the northwest corner, the same corner incidentally that he initially occupied the first night. This situation was still maintained on nights 27 to 30 except that M3 was permitted into the area. During this latter period M5 was most commonly seen along the north side of the sector while M3 occupied the western side. They were never found together in the actual corner at the same time. Territorial behavior by M5 was not evident during the feeding trial described above. It is uncertain whether there was any causal relationship between the rearrangement of the physical environment of the yard (days 45-62) and the change in behavior. Certainly M5 was less territorial on nights 27 to 30 when he tolerated M3, than he was on nights 13 to 16. He did not resume territorial behavior by nights 70 to 73 following restoration of the original yard organization. Following the introduction of females into the yard at sunset on night 74, the situation changed again and M5 established a territory that encompassed almost the entire western half of the yard. This change was clearly evident by night 76. As can be seen from Table 4, few male excursions into this area occurred on nights 76 to 78. The exception was M3 but four of the six records in the northwest quarter were when he was feeding at FP4. During these same three nights most of the activity of females was within M5's territory. This restriction in the movements of females to the vicinity of M5 was even more notice- able during the two final observation periods, nights 83 to 88 and 100 to 103, even though M5 tolerated M1 in a large portion of the southwestern sector. There was no clear reason why M5 should establish a territory based in the northwest corner in preference to any other area. Food and at least one artificial shelter were available in each sector, and water was present on the south side as well as in the northwest quarter. The northwestern corner was neither the most sunny, nor the most shaded or protected from the wind. In effect, there was no apparent selective advantage to the area he chose. Actually there was one possible disadvantage in that a path ran along the west fence that was used by students several times a day, and this might be expected to be a disturbing influence. While there is no direct evidence, the closeness of the association between M5 and all of the females, and the general behavior of M5, would suggest that this dominant male was probably the father of the four young subsequently born. Utilization of food and water points.-The only restriction on the use of the four food pans was due to the territorial behavior of M5, whose area generally included pan February 1969 17</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY FP4. Other males did feed at this site throughout the study, and this accounts for many of the apparently anomalous sightings in this sector, particularly between nights 13 and 30. However, when M5 was defending this area, few other males were able to eat there for long at one time. The same applies to FP3 on nights 76 to 78 when M5 defended the whole western half of the yard. Even though the females generally remained in the western half, they all utilized all of the food pans at least once. F5 was the only female to use FP1 and FP2 frequently, however; and just over one-third of the recorded sightings of this animal on the eastern side were made when she was feeding there. Daytime Activity Other duties prevented me from making systematic observations during the daytime. Many, brief visits were made, however, and the positions of all animals were recorded on numerous mornings. There was little general activity compared to during the evening hours. This subjective judgement is supported by the records of the utilization of the small food enclosure discussed above and shown in Fig. 2, and is in keeping with the known field behavior (Packer, 1965). The early morning records of nonsleeping animals show that most of the animals were located in relatively sheltered positions most of the time. Among the females, Fl, F2, and F3 were seen most often in the southwest corner, whereas F4 and F5 were generally situated in the northeast corner. Sleeping Little information is available from field studies on the sleeping behavior of Setonix brachyurus. Quokkas have been observed asleep under various sorts of shelter during the day but never at night. However, the length of time spent sleeping or whether it is done in one continuous period or intermittently is not known. In captivity, for some reason, sleeping quokkas are not commonly observed. The normal sleeping position for the quokka is sitting bipedally on the hind feet with the tail extended anteriorly and with the head and forearms tucked between the back legs. In this position they resemble little more than a furry ball. The animals were seldom observed asleep at night in the study enclosure and never were seen so when both sexes were present in the yard. In only one instance was a male observed to sleep longer than the period between two successive recording intervals (longer than 15 minutes). The exception was M4 who slept through the entire ob- servation period one night (13/4 hrs). Few instances of sleeping were recorded in the early morning surveys. M3 was seen asleep in the northwest corner once in the final month of the study, and this is the only record of sleeping from that period. When males only were in the enclosure, sleeping individuals were observed at least once in all of the artificial shelters except Sl but most frequently in S3. Other instances were seen in the northwest and southwest corers and sometimes between a tree and the fence, for example behind the tree next to the northeastern gate. They were never observed asleep without some sort of shelter or protection. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY The quokka is generally able to survive well and reproduce in captivity. Most of the colonies established to date have been breeding colonies, con- sisting predominantly of females, and used solely as sources of pouch young for physiological work. Mortality, due presumably to a stress syndrome, can occur if too many males are placed together in too small a pen (Packer, unpublished data) and Vol. 50, No. 1 18</page><page sequence="12">PACKER-BEHAVIOR OF SETONIX even separately housed individuals may die if too confined (Kakulas, 1961). The present work has shown that given a greater area in which to live and move, and sufficient feeding points to reduce the frequency of aggressive- ness among the males over access to food, a confined population can be maintained and will breed successfully. Since the young do not mature sexually until 18 to 24 months of age (Shield, 1964), the system of in- corporation of recruits into such a system remains to be determined. Never- theless, it is clear that a small artificially confined population exhibits many of the characteristics of free-living animals. These include general inactivity during the day, evening and early morning peaks in feeding, the selection of a diurnal sleeping or resting site in a relatively confined and sheltered space, and the formation of a social system that functions to reduce the in- cidence of fighting, although fighting may still occur in association with mating. Territoriality is not clearly evident in free-living quokkas, and its existence in the wild remains to be confirmed. Similarly, there is no evidence at present to suggest that the mechanism that reduces intraspecific aggressive- ness in the wild is a dominance hierarchy. Such may occur, but it may not be a simple hierarchy in view of the large number of animals in any one area as well as the seasonal presence of immigrants in some regions of Rottnest Island. The observations reported herein should give a reasonable basis for the interpretation of field behavior and the relationship of this behavior to the utilization of the habitat under the conditions of seasonal stress due to high temperature, poor quality of food, and shortage of potable water that exist on Rottnest during summer.
