<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAUNTED WORDS, OR DECONSTRUCTION ECHOED JEFFERSON HUMPHRIES In spite of all the learned have said, We hear the voices of the dead. -John Hollander, "The Widener Burying-Ground" John Hollander. THE FIGURE OF ECHO. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981. Our English word 'echo' is a distant reverberation of an ancient Greek enunciation: echo, rXw. The Greek is probably derived from qxm, meaning 'sound'; -w is an ending common to many feminine names in classical Greek [Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, p. 830]. Although the use of the word itself predates its mythological apotheosis as the nymph who fell in love with Narcissus, the transformation of the word 'sound' into an apparently proper name anticipates the mythology. Echo is, as John Hollander puts it, "voice's self' [p. 61], an anthropomorphic allegorization, a prosopopeia of the phenomenon of 'sound.' And not just of sound, but more specifically, of voice, the sound of language. As Hollander says, the "association of concavity [which reflects sound] with a lurking and invisible vocal presence is central to what the imagination has made of the phenomenon of echo" [p. 2, my emphasis]. According to the myth, Echo, who had for a brief and, one supposes, blissful hiatus consorted with Pan (long enough to bear lynx by him), was at the time of her acquaintance with Narcissus condemned to use her voice only in repetition of the words of others. This was "a punishment for having kept Hera entertained with long stories while Zeus' concubines, the mountain nymphs, made good their escape" [Robert Graves, The Greek Myths I (Middlesex, England: Penguin, 1962), p. 287]. Smitten with the boy Narcissus, she was no longer able, as she had been with the wrathful Hera, to seduce him with words of her own: At last Narcissus, finding that he had strayed from his companions, shouted: 'Is anyone here?' 'Here!' Echo answered, which surprised Narcissus, since no one was in sight. 'Come!' 'Come!' 'Why do you avoid me?' 'Why do you avoid me?' 'Let us come together here!' 'Let us come together here!' repeated Echo, and joyfully rushed from her hiding place to embrace Narcissus. Yet he shook her off roughly, and ran away.'I will die before you ever lie with me!' he cried. V? / I) : I . :'I,' r/ / xt /i I J diacritics / summer 1983 29</page><page sequence="2">'Lie with me!' Echo pleaded. But Narcissus had gone, and she spent the rest of her life in lonely glens, pining away for love and mortification, until only her voice remained. [Graves, Myths, p. 287] This would become the prototype of the 'echo poem'; Mr. Hollander devotes a chapter to such literary schemes based on repetition. Here, for instance, is part of George Herbert's "Heaven": 0 who will show me these delights on high? Echo, I. Thou Echo, thou art Mortall, all men know. Echo, No. [Hollander, p. 28] Juxtapose this with Swift's "What most moves women when we them address? Echo: A dress" [p. 28], and the scale from mocking irony to solemnly expansive askesis along which the scheme of repetition with a difference, or echo, may be inflected, is sharply drawn. All of the particular rhetorical forms which echo may take are based on the way in which a word or phrase need only be repeated, in whole or part, to be turned or troped. What ought to be no more than plagiarizing turns out to be'original,' or at least, as original as what it repeats. Echo might not intend to reply to Narcissus' questions, but her repetitions of those questions cannot avoid constituting answers. Aside from the repetition of a word or group of words verbatim, echo has many rhetorical avatars: anadiplosis, in which only the last word of a line or phrase is repeated as the beginning of the following one; antanaclasis, or "homonymic pun" (rain/reign, for instance); anaphora or repetitio, in which the same word is repeated in the beginning of a succession of phrases or lines; epanalepsis, or as Puttenham called it [The Arte of English Poesie, 1589], "eccho sounde," in which each line or phrase repeats as its ending the word with which it began. [See the appropriate entries in Richard A. Lanham, A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1968).] The myth, all of these schemes, and Hollander's book, imply a great deal more about the nature of the concepts of voice and presence as applied to texts than they explicitly say. What they imply, by such incongruously dainty allegory, would not be thought pretty by many of those who would find Mr. Hollander's subject and style charmingly elegant. "The reader of texts," writes Hollander, "in order to overhear echoes, must have some kind of access to an earlier voice, and to its cave of resonant signification, analogous to that of the author of the later text" [p. 65]. To "hear" a literary echo, we must have a sense of anteriority, of a specific prior origin of enunciation, when reading a text. We must, then, be "belated" readers to be good ones, to be sensitive to the quavering vicissitudes of this incorporeal voice, this pseudonymph. Yet the prior text's "originality" is always a false, though necessary, assumption: the earlier text must be just as much within the nymph's domain as the later one. It is neither a fine point nor one of sophistry but sheer logical consistency to assert that originality and priority are phenomena of momentary perspective. In comparing two texts which echo one another, Hollander writes insightfully that "Sandys 'echoes' Johnson, in an echo device, about the poignancy of the fragmentation of utterance when it is rebounded" [p. 61]. Echo- as allegory, scheme, or metaphor- points to a loss of the Logos, a deferment of origin through the ever repeated, always provisional postulation of a primal anteriority. The first "voice" or origin is always displaced by its own repetition. The question 'What is being echoed?" makes every text into an echo, a repetition of and deferment to another text; what is being repeated or echoed are other echoes. The question of chronological priority is really moot in this perspective. Texts echo other texts, reciprocally. Negative theories of literary repetition, which treat it as a necessarily entropic phenomenon (as in the case of Harold Bloom), do not seriously consider echo from this syn- chronic point of view. if they did, they would cancel themselves out. According to Hollander, The negative readings of Echo come from associations of fragmentation of the anterior voice, the hollowness of her concavities of origin transferred to the 30</page><page sequence="3">figurative hollowness of her words, and the progressive diminution of successive reverberations. [p. 11] That is, they do not question the mythic allegation that Echo once had flesh, once was a presence as well as a voice, and that some state of self-possessed originality preceded her lapse into repetitiousness. Such a pure anteriority of presence can only be believed in, assumed; it cannot be demonstrated. The belief in it relegates echo, repetition as we know it, to a "post-lapsarian" inferiority. Thus literary echoes repeat a revisionary fall away from primal plenitude, represented for Bloom in English by Milton. Such theories are called into doubt in the scheme of echo itself, and in Hollander's discussions of it, especially as he draws more of his examples from Milton than from any other work. The status of a work's or a text's or a word's being originary is shown to be purely perspectival by Hollander's detailed demonstration of the way Paradise Lost depends for so many of its greatest effects of irony and askesis on self-echo, "the poem's memory of itself" [p. 51]. Here is an example: Shade in paradise is a lovely variation from sunlight; this "Pillar'd shade," and that of the "shady bank / Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd" have already been imprinted with the shadowy type of death. In Book 1, 301-3, the famous and heav- ily allusive image of the fallen legions of the rebel "Angel Forms" shows them as lying "Thick as autumnal Leaves that strew the Brooks / In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades / High overarch't imbower" (my italics). The specific verbal echo accom- panies the shadows cast by the earlier text on the futurity of all shady places. And, as elsewhere in Milton, the rhetorical echo calls up the literal acoustical event .... There is something like dramatic irony in a character's inadvertant echo of the narrative voice by which even his own utterance is recounted. There is also, as we have been seeing, a kind of allusive typology in the more possibly self-aware echo of an earlier moment in Miltonic narration by a later one. [pp. 49-50] Often such ironic repetition takes the form of "manifest rhetorical figuration turning out, hor- ribly, to have been literal" [p. 51]. A text like Milton's, which echoes itself, displaces its own locus backwards and forwards, loses itself, in effect, deliberately, in order to achieve a sublimely poetic effect, is a powerful antidote to entropic views of echo. If we combine these observations with another statement of Hollander's, the problems which this quite wonderful effect poses for traditional ways of thinking about literature stand out starkly: In contrast with literary allusion echo is a metaphor of, and for, alluding, and does not depend on conscious intention. The referential nature of poetic echo, as of dreaming (or Coleridgean "symbol" as opposed to conscious "allegory'g, may be unconscious or inadvertant, but is no less qualified thereby. [p. 64, my emphasis] Echo can be inter- or intratextual; in either case, it renders notions of originality and inten- tionality highly problematic. It is always possible to hear an echo where none is intended. It is, indeed, always possible to hear an echo other than the one intended, or to perform an echo without meaning to, or to perform an echo other than the one intended. We may use the myth and the classic definition of the English word to derive the model of textuality, of writing and reading, which Mr. Hollander's book infers and demonstrates. The Oxford English Dictionary gives the primary definition as follows: A repetition of sounds, which is produced by the reflexion of the sound-waves due to their incidence on something denser than the aerial medium in which they are propagated; hence concr. a secondary or imitative sound produced by reflected waves, as distinguished from the original sound caused by direct waves. [p. 830] According to the myth, Echo's frustrated desire for Narcissus reduced her to nothing but a disembodied voice, which prolonged the last words of Narcissus as he pined away in unre- diacritics / summer 1983 31</page><page sequence="4">quitable love of his own image's "echo" in the water: "Ah youth beloved in vain, farewell" [Graves, Myths, p. 287]. Rather like Sandys' literary echo of Johnson, we are faced with an auditory echo which repeats words addressed to a visual 'echo,' all motivated by frustrated desire for an auditory or visual double: Echo's repetition of Narcissus' words "echoes" his reflection in the water. If we take Mr. Hollander's self-consciously figural use of the words "echo," "reverberation," and "resonance" [p. 3] to apply to literary texts which in our age are usually read silently, we must consider the myth and the acoustical definition as also being figural. We have here a repetition of signs, rather than sound, and a textual medium, rather than an aerial one. The "something denser" which reflects the sounds would be a reader or another text (another writer). The OED definition distinguishes sound from echo as direct, rather than reflected, sound waves. This distinction is highly problematic, acoustically speak- ing. Hollander observes that echoes may be "difficult to recognize as such, not so much because the original voice is absent, but because voice and echo are so close together as to be indistinguishable." ... a certain amount of echoing overhang is necessary in every actual human acoustical situation in order to avoid a sense of sonic death, of an absorbent ambi- ance that gobbles up all the morsels of speech or song we produce, returning none and thus ruining our full perception of what we ourselves utter. [p. 53] Original sound and secondary echo contaminate one another. Although Hollander adds that "The analogy [with sound] hardly holds for textual echoes," yet his own demonstrations and discussions imply very much the contrary. If voice and echo were entirely distinct, neither could be heard. Can a text be "literary" if it is devoid of all literary resonance? It is hard to imagine'how. It would have to somehow succeed in being absolutely distinct from, and demonstrably ignorant of, everything heretofore called literary, and yet remain within the bounds of what we call "literature." The myth inscribes a similar convolution. Echo repeats Narcissus' words, but Narcissus' words "translate" the desire and frustration which he feels looking at his visual echo in the water. Desire is acutely implied as the medium in which echo (visual and acoustical) occurs, and yet it is impossible to tell echo from medium, repeti- tion from desire- impossible to locate a point of origin within the medium, a point at which totalized self-sufficiency gives way to outer-directed desire and a concurrent sense of fragmentariness, lack of wholeness, and dependency. One is inevitably reminded of Jacques Lacan's stade du miroir, in which the constitution of a child's "self' is associated with his perception of himself as "other," in a mirror. [See Lacan, "Le stade du miroir comme formateur de la fonction du Je," Ecrits I (Paris: Seuil, 1966).] Constitution of the self is a kind of achieved fragmentariness. The differential contamination of sound by resonance, acoustical origin by repetition, and vice-versa, is similarly illustrated by the principle of acoustics alluded to above by Hollander: if a sound is not reflected at all, it has no resonance and cannot be fully heard. The mutual determination of sound and repetition cannot be spatially or temporally con- fined. One either recognizes it or refuses to. Sound as we know it is the result of the impact of vibratory waves on molecules of air. The only difference between air and, say, a stone wall, is density. The air does not impede the sound-waves as much as the stone, but if it did not impede it at all, there would be no sound. Insofar as echo diminishes, it must necessarily be entropic, and the myth, with its anni- hilation of Narcissus and disembodiment of Echo, confirms this. However, if echo contami- nates what it echoes-casts it in a new light, "turns" or tropes it by substituting a derivation for the "original"-then the "entropy" works both forwards and backwards and is, like anteriority, a matter of perspective. Synchronically, there is no "entropy" but only mutual repetition, which is reciprocal troping. In the gap of difference across which echo resounds, a change of meaning occurs which, however slight, acts as a trope. The echo device and its variant schemes of refrain and patterned repetition can have, as we have seen, a force of figuration much deeper than that of mere decorative patterning. In the very rhetoric of returning only part of an utterance, 32</page><page sequence="5">WV b s s there is something of trope always implicit, just as one or another of the mythologies of the Nymph herself- mocking, lamenting, assenting, amplifying, and, indeed, interpreting- can always be adduced. [p. 60] What Hollander discovers, by the simple but ingenious application of acoustical, rather than silently linguistic principle, is that repetition (in some, however slight, degree) and resonance, and therefore diff6rance, govern everything we say and indeed, make it possible for us to say anything, whether aloud, on the telephone or across a room, or in a "literary" text. It is impossible for us to say exactly what we mean, for if we say anything at all we say more than one thing. Sound is only audible if it strikes some medium of resistance, air or stone, and is deflected. Everything we say must "trope" itself in order to be heard. We have seen how this works in the question and answer format of the "echo poem." Hollander considers any given echo as occurring somewhere along two continuums of distinction. One opposes irony to expansive askesis; this we might call the rhetorical con- tinuum. The other opposes perfectly tautological repetition to such tropes as anadiplosis, which repeats only the end of one line or phrase as the beginning of the next. We might call this scale from perfect duplication to disfiguring omission the differential continuum. At the same time, because irony may be expansive and askesis ironic, and because punning tends to obliterate the difference between tautology and trope, these continuums are, therefore, a matter of perspective as well, and from the right angle, they appear to be points rather than lines. Still, Hollander shows that there is a good deal to be gained from such polarities, which may be stretched out, if not in a line, then at least in a circle. He sees, for instance, the affir- mative, expansive echo as exemplified in Paradise Lost by the "First Hymn" (V, 153-208), which "invokes heavenly powers for aid in amplification of its praising voice . But the unfallen hymn of praise transcends the anaphora and catalogue of its precur- sor Psalm 148 by seeming to generate its refrain - indeed, the very idea of refrain - during the course of its unfolding. The Original hymn not only originates refrain, but interprets the scheme as a trope of echo - as assent, consent, concert, consonance, approval, and witness. This affirmative aspect of echo's figure completely obliterates a negative, mocking one, which appears in a starkly literal way earlier, again in the demonic milieu of Book II. Sin's account to Satan of her parturition of Death concludes as her son, "he my inbred enemy," "forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart / Made to destroy." The fol- lowing lines are strongly Ovidian: "I fled, and cri'd out Death; Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd / From all her Caves, and back resounded Death" (II, 787-89). [pp. 37, 42-43] Yet of course the "affirmative" echoing of the Hymn does not "obliterate" the more negative instance but rather is nourished by its opposition. In Hollander's use of the word "obliterate" we see an illustration of the very phenomenon under discussion. He means it figuratively, in the sense of "overshadow" or "overwhelm." But his figurative use of the word is necessarily echoed by the word's more literal meaning, which his use, in this context, might be said to "erase." But the figural meaning needs the literal one. Without erasure to "obliterate," the figural meaning is meaningless. Similarly, the Hymn needs the counterexample of Death's diacritics / summer 1983 33</page><page sequence="6">resonance, and vice-versa. The negative example, says Hollander, "uses the materials of pastoral affirmative echo, perverted in the Satanic mode of eternally twisted tropings" [p. 43]. The Hymn and its Satanic "perversion" echo one another, and thereby amplify one another's respective affirmation and negation. Echo is used to magnify its own effects in two different directions. Askesis and irony clearly echo one another. As for the second continuum, the "differential" one, there are two basic kinds of per- fectly repetitious echo, one best illustrated by the French rime equivoquie widely used by the rhetoriqueurs of the early Renaissance. Here is a nineteenth century example by Theodore de Banville: "Dans ces meubles laques, rideaux et dais moroses, I Danse, aime, bleu laquais, ris d'oser des mots roses" [Hollander, p. 32]. This is an effect which English could not achieve because of the hindrance of word-stress, which French does not have. The French has the greater advantage of a smaller vocabulary and catalogue of phonemes, making it easier to find words and sounds which are overdetermined. The other sort of repetition does not pun but flatly repeats, as in this tercet from Paradiso XXXII, in which "The word, meaning perfection, can rhyme with no other. It resounds, in a very different way from previous instances, only with, and in, itself." Riguarda omai nella faccia ch'a Cristo pih si somiglia, ch6 la sua chiarezza sola ti pub disporre a veder Cristo (Look now at the face most like Christ; for only its brightness can fit you to see Christ) (XXXII, 85-87) [p. 54] This "mere" reiteration is a highly significant rhetorical strategy, which might be said to establish itself in opposition to pun, which repeats perfectly and yet changes at the same time. In this example, repetition "echoes" pun, as it were, by refusing it, deflecting the possibility of it. In doing so it makes pun appear supercilious and undignified at the same time that pun makes it seem loftily superior. The ratio of difference between word or words and echo may be one of negation or affirmation, irony or askesis, perfect duplication, pun, or omission used to reveal latent meaning (which may be mocking or expansive), as in Herbert's poem "Heaven," cited above or "French echoes which plucked . . . from la chose plus infame, the inevitable femme ..." [p. 28]. Whatever sort of echo one may be confronted by, its significative resonance is a function of its contamination, its involvement with other sorts of echo- a function, in sum, of its repetitiousness, its fragmentariness, its dependence and non-integrity. Considered as a metaphor of allusion, echo leads to a consideration of its dependence on the reader to achieve its effects, and to an examination of the way in which the concept of intentionality is assumed and undermined by allusive echo. Hollander, in a passage already cited, distinguishes echo from allusion as not dependent on a writer's intention. "An inadvertant echo," on the other hand, "is a kind of solecism" [p. 64]. If echo is an effective metaphor for allusion, but different from it in this crucial respect, a close look at the role of intentionality as it underlies Hollander's terms and assumptions will reveal further implica- tions of his study, and of echo's extended acoustical and mythological figure. Echo and allusion are most tellingly intertwined in titles such as Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, an allusion to Macbeth: 'Told by an idiot full of sound and fury." This "points to Faulkner's making the visionary idiot Benjy a significant narrator" [p. 106]. Such titles as this do not echo but allude; they "implicitly assume a reader's knowledge of the source" [p. 106]. Allusion might be described as an echo willfully orchestrated by the writer to resound tauto- logically in the reader's ear- that is, to be read by the reader just as it was written, meant, by the writer. This raises some theoretical questions. Can literary reverberation be strictly governed by intention? Acoustical echo might be made to produce certain predictable effects under laboratory conditions. Is there a textual analogue of "laboratory conditions"? The case of another allusive title suggests that, under the best of circumstances, there is sooner or later a necessary effect of chance, of omission or addition, implicit in the literary act of alluding- an unavoidable contamination by echo which erodes any possibility of a controllable resonance. If texts can "remember," they can also forget. They can even 34</page><page sequence="7">MOM "misremember." For a text is constituted as much by the act of reading as by the act of writing, and the gap from writer to reader across which allusion occurs is too much like that over which echo achieves its unwillful troping for some troping, some unwitting inflection of primary intention, not at some point to occur. The result may be, literarily, highly propitious. An easy example is the title of the popular antebellum fantasy, Gone with the Wind. [One notes with amusement the New Yorker Hollander's barely sublimated horror at the irreducible Otherness of the Southern myth of origin, transposed into crass popular culture by the latter day belle, Miss Mitchell.] The implicit grammar of the phrase, in relation to the book's subject, suggests that the Old South has "gone"- vanished -along with the passing wind, and to wherever the winds go. But in the context of its source, Ernest Dowson's poem about Cynara, the phrase has a different syntax, and a different sense: I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind, Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng, Dancing to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind ... Here, forgot, gone, and flung are all compound and parallel, and the subject of all of them is I (have); gone means "run," "gone to play," not "vanished." But perhaps the American title's misreading of the syntax was abetted by another resonant memory (aside from the association of "pale, lost lilies" with the faded belles of the story). Although there is no trace of verbal echo, the missing presence may come at the end of the phrase, "gone with the wind- like the ghosts of leaves from an enchanter fleeing"; and Shelley's west wind of destruction and preservation may be blowing through the mistake. Even the milieu of Dowson's phrase brings up a matter of erotic loss, and perhaps the peculiarities of her title, which create a new meaning and resonance for the phrase as if Dowson had never written, must be deemed Miss Mitchell's major literary accomplishment. [pp. 106-7] Mr. Hollander has an acid tongue indeed. Miss Mitchell's "major literary accomplishment" is not hers at all but her readers', attained by a complete misunderstanding of her intentions. Not only is her title's echo distortingly reechoed in the "ears" of her readers but that reecho- ing then seems to be echoed by Dowson's text, the one echoed in the first place. The same poem by Dowson had also been echoed by Joyce in the "Aeolus" chapter of Ulysses in an effect "clearly like that of Mitchell's revision" [p. 107]. Hollander observes that "Stephen Dedalus' association of Dowson's wind with the vanished Tara, in a context, in Ulysses, of rhetorical hot air, seems uncannily like a notebook germ of Miss Mitchell's book. I doubt that it was" [pp. 107-8]. Despite such effects which appear to undermine the distinction between echo and allu- sion except as a purely taxonomic one, Hollander writes that "I could imagine true echo creeping into an allusive title only when something has gone wrong- some trick of memory or misconstruction . . ." [p. 106]. Sooner or later, however, his own acoustical metaphor sug- gests, something is bound to go wrong, some omission or troping bound to occur, and indeed, for the sake of the text, ought to occur. The trouble with allusion, or metalepsis, as rhetoric calls it, is that it is grounded in nothing more than the ectoplasmic "presence" of an original intention, and "Such is a true ghost: like all phenomena of this sort, we must always diacritics / summer 1983 35</page><page sequence="8">wonder what our own contribution was- how much we are always being writers as well as readers of what we are seeing" [p. 99]. The spirit, disembodied voice that lurks within the text, is a poltergeist. It plays tricks, breaks things, trips us up. Hollander includes an appendix on metalepsis as a particular kind of literary echoing. Richard Lanham defines the figure simply: Present effect attributed to a remote cause: "The ship is sinking: damn the wood where the mast grew." The remote cause, because several causal steps intervene between it and the result, seems less like a cause than a metaphor substituted for a cause. Smith (Mysterie of Rhetorique) gives the following aberrant definition: "when divers Tropes are shut up in one word: as, 2 Kings, 2.9. I pray thee let me have a double portion of thy spirit." Quintillian (VIII, vi, 37 ff.) calls it a transition from one trope to another. "The commonest example is the following: cano is a synonym for canto and canto for dico, therefore cano is a synonym for dico, the intermediate step being provided by canto." The main element would thus seem to be omission of a central term in an extended metaphor. [Handlist of Rhetorical Terms, pp. 65-66] It is, as Harold Bloom puts it, "a figure of a figure" [A Map of Misreading (New York: Oxford, 1975), p. 102]. The odd thing about metalepsis is that it is a sort of haunted trope. It alludes to, and is grounded in, something which it omits, the "ghost" which haunts it. This ghost, this gap across which metalepsis resounds, at least potentially allows the echo of allusion to reverberate continually, without ever reaching a "definitive" status. We might further describe the trope of metalepsis or transumption as a sort of syllogism: x is like y, and y is like z, therefore x is like z. Y, the actual metalepsis, is omitted. Just as in the case of echo, x, y, and z may be identical, the same word, echoing itself, dissolving into tautology, or quite dif- ferent. The ratio of difference may give rise to all sorts of rhetorical effects. The possibilities for fallaciousness are apparent. But also apparent is that there might be many metalepses, many terms linking x and z. The writer might have had one in particular in mind, but this need not imply that a reader, ignorant of the writer's intention, might not come up with better ones, more interesting, more resonant. Let us take another example, one which Mr. Hollander has brought to my attention in conversation: "Nevermore," the refrain of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven," may very well refer to the Latin word cras, "tomorrow." Cras, rather than caw, is the sound a Roman crow would have made, as remnants of folklore attest. Thus "nevermore" tropes the Latin, negates the meaning of cras which provides the metaleptic link between the noise made by a raven and "nevermore." The French Symbolist transumption of Poe and "The Raven" has completely crowded out this allusive understanding, making "nevermore" into a symbol of loss, pure anteriority, rather than a metalepsis of Latin. Who is to say that Poe's poem has not been improved by being thus misconstrued (if in fact his intentions were different, along the lines of Hollander's surmise) by Mallarme and a long line of anglophone interpreters who fol- lowed the French lead? Poe's reputation has always been far greater in France than in America or, for that matter, England. The most important implication of Hollander's rich little book is one he shrinks from stating outright: that all troping, and therefore all literary language (and arguably all language) is haunted by an absence, a disembodied voice, an ectoplasmic presence which must e-lude all attempts to definitive identification. It does not make sense to say that an echo is "correct" or "incorrect," only that it is more or less resonant, more or less ironic or revelatory, mocking or affirming. Reading itself echoes a prior act of writing, which echoes other acts of reading and writing. Each echo "distorts" the others in some way, even if it perfectly repeats it, yet there is no reason why "distortion" should imply vitiation. Primacy is a matter of perspective, and perspective changes all the time. Hollander casts doubt on rhetorical analysis itself by pointing out that even it is highly resonant. All taxonomies of rhetorical figure have in fact been themselves interpretive. The history of the particular concepts of metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and irony- not to speak of notions like allegory, parable, fable, fiction, figure, image, and type - is itself a meandering one. [p. 149] 36</page><page sequence="9">,i : :Ir, L r J; ~I r? 1*?7 e; .-?- --?--r=I O 1 L. j u 2? r : ? r4 ~5~i I) ~ ~r I ,i. ?!f~3? 5c~-;? I This, of course, is a doubt which the most subtle practitioners of rhetorical analysis must share. Paul de Man, for instance, who argues in favor of rhetorical readings only because ... the structures and functions they expose do not lead to the knowledge of an entity (such as language) but are an unreliable process of knowledge production that prevents all entities, including linguistic entities, from coming into discourse as such, [so that] they are indeed universals, consistently defective models of language's impossibility to be a model language. They are, always in theory, the most elastic theoretical and dialectical model to end all models and they can rightly claim to contain within their own defective selves all the other defective models of reading- avoidance, referential, semiological, grammatical, performative, logical, or whatever. ["The Resistance to Theory," Yale French Studies No. 63 (1982), p. 20] Rhetorical analysis is thus not a way out of the quandary ("the impossibility of reading," de Man calls it) but, for de Man, the only satisfactory way of working within it. It does not solve the difficulty, but admits it. One may wonder if Hollander has not come upon a model of reading and writing that is not just as inclusive, just as universal in its unreliability, as rhetorical reading. For whatever the method with its claims to rigor and accuracy, the scholar, in the final analysis, is no different from the poet or the most ignorant amateur reader who, confronted with a text, must finally say, "to a faceless will, / Echo of mine, I am amenable" [ames Merrill, "Mirror," in The Country of a Thousand Years of Peace, 2nd ed. (New York: Atheneum, 1970), p. 37]. To the avowed deconstructionist, so long after Derrida, or A.D., this might appear as little more than trivial restatement of basic assumptions. It is more than that insofar as it manages to attain an antilogocentric stance (albeit one not fully developed or entirely aware of being such) through a more traditionally thematic and philological approach, without the sometimes cumbersome means of deconstruction. Those who have come to take the inevi- tably arcane pleasures of the latter for granted may not wish to admit what is going on in Hollander's book.' As Paul de Man writes of literary theory in all its avatars (including his own), "Such insecurity about its own project calls for self-analysis, if one is to understand the frustrations that attend upon its practitioners, even when they seem to dwell in serene methodological self-assurance" ["The Resistance to Literary Theory," p. 12]. Such insecurity on the part of deconstructive theorists, confronted by Hollander's book (or my reading of it), would effectively reenact the very mythological narrative which Hollander takes as point of departure. Deconstruction would therefore find itself corroborating the hypotheses of its own theoretical enterprise. None but the most liberal and self-possessed practitioners will be pleased. 1'There are many piously jealous outbursts of this sort in contemporary deconstructive literature. Jonathan Culler writes that "At the Colloque de Cerisy on Derrida in 1980, there were many complaints, especially by Americans, about the mechanical application of Derridean deconstruction, in America, to literary studies - an institutionalization that deprives it of its original radical force .. ." [On Deconstruc- tion (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982), p. 228n]. This insecurity on the part of American deconstructors might be explained as a defense against their own status as "echoes" of the Continental "original." Of course, to assert the primacy (originality) of the latter is to fall victim to the most predictable nostalgia for totalization, and to deprive deconstruction more than ever of its "radical force." diacritics / summer 1983 37</page><page sequence="10">John Brenkman, in an article which Hollander (pointedly?) does not cite, interprets the Ovidian recapitulation of the Narcissus and Echo tale as what de Man would call an allegory of reading, or parable of the impossibility of reading. That is to say, the narrative deconstructs its own logic, "endlessly tells the story of its own denominational aberration" [Paul de Man, Allegories of Reading (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), p. 162]. Brenkman shows that, while Ovid's story must presuppose the existence of the self, in fact it dramatizes the way in which the self comes into being as a trope of a trope, or pure signifier, a substitution of a substitution; Narcissus does not know that he is in love with himself until he pronounces the words "Iste ego sum," which mark the instant in which his self comes into being in the only way it can, as alterity, through difference- an instant in which the difference between his desire and Echo's is abolished, their object revealed as identical (the "image" of Narcissus). This instant in which the tension (Freudian Eros) between the two is reduced to naught is its inevitable transformation into Freudian Thanatos, stasis. Both Narcissus and Echo disappear, only to survive in the distortions of echo's disembodied repetitions. The other-directed desire from which Narcissus had seemed immune is expressed as a desire for the self-as-other. The story opposes Narcissus' self-directed desire to Echo's other-directed desire, and yet Brenkman shows that the opposition of image (writing) and voice (speech) dramatized in their encounter is a dialectic in which each version of desire contaminates, makes possible, and deconstructs the possibility of the other. Each tropes the other, substitutes for the other's prior substitution, with no point of origin in sight. Taken separately, their stories are related to one another through a displaced parallelism -a parallelism in that each character is pushed toward death when desire is not reciprocated by another, a displaced parallelism in that for Echo the other is another like herself, while for Narcissus the other is his mirror image. In both instances sexual union fails to occur, first because Narcissus withholds it and then because it is impossible. Their stories intersect in a way that gives meaning to this dif- ference. Narcissus's imaginary capture is presented as the "punishment" for his refusal to reciprocate the desire of others, and his encounter with Echo is obviously the nar- rative's most developed example of such a refusal. In short, the refusal to reciprocate desire is answered by the impossibility of having desire reciprocated. [John Brenkman, "Narcissus in the Text," Georgia Review, 30 (1976), p. 297] One may expect the more apostolic practitioners of deconstruction to reject Hollander's book, or my reading of it, for to accept it would repeat Narcissus' realization (Iste ego sum or "There I am") and subsequent demise, abolish their "erotic" tension, or differential distance with regard to an Echo whose object of desire is (here, at least) the same as theirs, their very discourse, its spitting image. For the instant in which Narcissus admits his self-recognition is the instant in which he disappears, to survive only in the endless allusions of repetitions which are helpless to control their own distortions. Thus Hollander's book (or my reading of it) might be taken as evidence both of the demise of deconstruction as "Narcissus," that is, in its more solipsistic (and, in practice, rather esoteric and incestuous) phase, and of its necessary survival as "Echo." The essential validity of its most powerful (and basic) assertions is thus confirmed even as its "image," its discourse, is submerged into its own depth. 38</page></plain_text>
