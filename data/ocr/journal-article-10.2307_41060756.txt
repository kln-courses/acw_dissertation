Two 25th Dynasty Coffins in Oslo1 Anders Bettum (Tafel 5-10) Abstract The coffins of Dismutenibtes (C47708) and Aaiu (C47709) in the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo were given scholarly attention in the 1860's and 70's, but have not been studied since. In 2006, it was discovered that Dismutenibtes was the mother of Osirmose, whose coffins today are located in Li√®ge and Brussels. The dis- covery gave the author of this article the incentive for a thorough study of the coffins and their modern history. Both coffins were donated to the museum by Giovanni Anastasi, possibly in the year 1826. From an eyewitness account recorded in a letter form 1862, it can be discerned that the coffins arrived together as one ensemble con- taining a single mummy. Due to the different names, a connection between the coffins was never considered by the 19th century scholars. In this article, the connection has been reexamined with regard to stylistic, textual and historic criteria. It is concluded that both coffins most probably belonged to a woman named Dismutenibtes, known also by the pet name Aaiu/ Iuiu. Along with Osirmose and his father Padiamunet, whose coffins are now in the British Museum, she was buried in an unknown family tomb in the Theban necropolis around 700 BC. The tomb must have been discovered by Anastasi's agent in the early 19th century, and its contents distributed to Europe in two separate shipments. In museums all over the world, we find Egyptian antiquities that were purchased or received as donations in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Due to the lack of documentation routines in the early years of archaeology, the provenance of such objects is often hard to establish. A major challenge to the study of material culture is to determine the place of origin and approximate date of these objects. A particular problem to the student of ancient Egyptian funerary equip- ment is the splitting up of ensembles belonging to the same tomb or person. Objects that are part of such ensembles can often be found in different museums. The re-establishment of the relationships between these membra disjecta is crucial to the study of genealogy, chronology and typology. Recent research has shed some light on two Egyptian coffins including a mummy at The Museum of Cultural History in Oslo (MCH), with regard to these and other problems. / The coffin of Dismutenibtes, C477082 The coffin of Dismutenibtes (Taf. 5-7) is an inner, anthropoid, bivalve wooden coffin. It is smoothly sculpted to resemble the contours of the mummy, and is equipped with a low (only 7 cm) pedestal at the foot end. The exterior surfaces of the lid and the base are decorated in bright colours on a white background. 1 The author works for the University of Oslo, Dep. of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages. This article is the result of several years of engagement with the Egyptian collection at MCH, and a two year long corres- pondence with Bart Hellinckx. I owe both him and John H. Taylor thanks for their enthusiastic guidance and support to this project. I am greatly indebted to conservator Eivind Bratlie at the MCH, who carried out the bulk of technical analysis included in this article, and dedicated hours of his precious time with me in magazines and laboratories.

The human remains have not yet been examined or conserved by up-to-date methods, and are not the object of this article. It should be mentioned, however, that two unwrapping sessions on this mummy are recorded after its arrival in Oslo (see below). What condition the mummy was in when it arrived is not known, but there is no doubt that considerable damage was inflicted during the two recorded examinations.

It is not [Thickness of walls: 1,5 cm possible to say if the wig and facial mask on the lid are separately carved or part of the head board underneath. Gesso and linen canvas were used to cover the discrepancies between the planks, and to give the coffin its body contours and the smooth, almost plastic look. The jagged surface of the gesso injunction of the two halves (Taf. 6) suggest that the gesso once sealed the coffin, and was cut open in modern times7. At least parts of the gesso and paint must therefore have been applied after the mummy was placed inside. When the gesso was dry, the coffin was whitewashed. Then the painters could begin work on the decorations. It is not currently clear in what order the different paint elements were added, or whether any kind of varnish was used on top. Traces of modest 19th century conservation can be found. A paper-tape band was once used to replace the broken gesso-seal between the lid and the base. The tape is painted in colours similar to the polychrome bands that run along the junction of the two halves of the coffin. In certain places the tape has fallen off, taking parts of the original paint with it (Taf. 6). As will be demonstrated below, the seal was both produced and broken after its arrival in Oslo. There is no evidence of any other conservation carried out before recent times. The coffin of Dismutenibtes has been exhibited on several occasions. Only in the last ten years, it has been on display in three different exhibitions.

The tip of the nose, which had broken off, was reconstructed. Conservation was carried out by Eivind Bratlie and Svein A. Wiik, MCH9. The coffin is currently on display in the permanent Egypt gallery. 1.2 Decoration of the lid The decoration of the lid is restricted to the exterior surface; the inside is simply painted white. The decorated surface belongs to a type labelled the 'sunrise' design by Taylor. According to this interpretation, the principal motifs on the lid (Taf. 5a) are connected, and represent the sun god's ascent form the Osirian or chthonic sphere of the Netherworld (at the foot end) to the celestial horizon (at the head end) at dawn10. When describing the various elements of this design below, I will use left/right designations relating to the mummy's point of view, i.e. opposite of the viewer's perspective. The low pedestal at the foot end is decorated with horizontal bands of yellow, red and blue, similar to the ones found in the junction of the two halves of the coffin. The central yellow band is thicker than the others, and was perhaps meant as background for a text that never was written. The decoration of the footboard (Taf. 7b) is damaged, but the remaining part is sufficient to identify the galloping Apis bull motif. The bull is carrying a mummy on its back. Six vertical columns with a yellow background were prepared for texts over the feet, but never filled in (Taf. 5a). Similar columns were added in some of the registers described below, and likewise, they contain no text. On each side of the columns at the feet we find a recumbent jackal deity painted in black on a white background (Taf. 6). The one on the (mummy's) right is named Wepwawet of Upper Egypt, Power of the Two Lands, and is holding the shedshed emblem in its front paws. The one on the left is named Anubis, foremost of the god's booth11 . The area above the paws is partially damaged, but it seems like this jackal also was holding the shedshed emblem of Wepwawet. The decoration of the frontal body field (Taf. 5a) consists of four symmetrical registers of deities, painted in yellow, red, green, blue and black on a white background. The two lower registers are symmetrically mirrored around a central axis in the shape of the Abydos fetish. Register 1 (from the bottom up) shows two mummy-form, ram-headed deities giving prise to the base of the Abydos fetish, flanked by a seated apotropaic deity on each side. The one on the right side has the head of a crocodile, and is holding a knife. The one on the left side has the head of a hippopotamus, and is holding an ankh. In register 2, two falcon-gods with sun discs on their heads extend their wings in a protective gesture towards the crown of the Abydos fetish. In between their wings, we find the shen symbol and a ram on a standard. The axiality of the upper registers is continued by the bodies and tail feathers of two falcons which spread their wings across the lid. The uppermost falcon is ram-headed, and its head, crowned with a solar disc, extends onto the collar12. In register 3, four seated apotropaic deities 8 A. Bettum, The mummy lives!

On each side, one deity is jackal-headed, the other snake-headed. They all hold knives. The jackal god on the right side is named Anubis. In register 4, we find the four sons of Horus, with Hapy and Imsety to the right and Duamutef and Qebehsenuef to the left. They are depicted mummy-form, wearing sash belts and, all but Duamutef, unguent cones (Taf. 7c). Two ureus-serpents are facing them, both wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt. This register should be seen in connection with the ram-headed falcon, which tail feathers constitute the central axis of this register. Together, they constitute the end of the Book of Caverns, which prototype is known form wall paintings in the Valley of the Kings13. The uppermost section of the lid is occupied by the facial mask, wig and collar found on all anthropoid coffins. A red stola (crossed braces) with yellow borders and ends is painted onto the floral collar. The face is red, and shows protruding ears. The tripartite wig is typical for the kind used on female coffins of the period14. The frontal lappets are blue, covered by a yellow vulture headdress. The individual feathers are not marked. The rear part of the wig, which extends to the base, is striped. The colours of the stripes follow the pattern yellow, blue, yellow and red, similar to wigs on male inner coffins15. The wig is crowned with a floral fillet, which also frames a scene on the top of the head. Here, a black scarab carrying a sun-disc between its front legs is painted on a white background (Taf. 7a). 1.3 Decoration of the base]6 Also the base is painted white on the inside, and only the exterior surface is decorated. Apart from the stripes of the wig continuing from the lid, the sides of the base are occupied by a text column with hieroglyphs outlined in black and filled in with blue paint. The hieroglyphs are painted on a white background, running from the shoulders down to the feet. They are written vertically, as if to be read when the coffin was standing in an upright position. The texts on each side are identical, except from the more generous use of space in the spelling of the last words in the left-hand text. The text is phrased as a djed-medu-in (words spoken by..) formula, and provides us with important genealogical information: Taf. 6, text 1: Words spoken by the Osiris, Lady of the House, Dismutenibtes, daughter of the Gate- keeper in Amun's Treasury, Hotepamun, son of the like-titeled Patjenef, true of voice. Her mother is the Lady of the House Nehemesbastet. The central motif on the underside of the base is a large, anthropomorphic djed-pillav, painted on a white background (Taf. 5b). The anthropomorphic elements include a pair of arms crossed in the Osirian pose, and a head seen in profile, facing leftwards (the deceased's right). The skin is coloured red. The figure is holding the crook and flail, and is wearing a divine beard, an atef-crown and sash belts. Two ureus serpents flank the sides of the lower part of the pillar. An inscription above the figure's left shoulder identifies him as "Osiris, lord of Busiris", perhaps to be continued above the right shoulder, where it says "Great God of .." .A vertical 13 Ibid. 269, 271. 14 J.H.

The hieroglyphs are outlined in black, and are not filled in. The text is painted on a yellow background framed by blue borders. It reads: Taf 5b, text 2: Words to be spoken: I am a Busirite, the son of a Busirite, I was conceived in Busiris, I was born in Busiris. The atef-srovm is painted on a white field which interrupts the continuation of the wig at the back of the coffin's head. Above the atef-crovm, a sun-disc is depicted. Two ureus serpents, one partly destroyed, swing their heads out on each side of the disc, carrying ankh-signs around their necks. Below the sun-disc, the place name Behedet is written, thus identifying the disc as the sun-god Behedety. A small inscription is also to be found on the back of each shoulder of the base, seemingly independent from the central motif. It says "upon his mountain", an epithet of Anubis. 1 tf ' 2 O 3 A~√≠ ‚Ñ¢ &lt;KZ^ c¬±= 4 '&lt;? &lt;‚Ä¢* √Ø√Øo T 4 tH ^ IT A &lt;=^ =8 5 ¬∞¬∞ ^ vr ¬Æy=i oii=r √§=¬´i=i /√¢ ^ ini=rsi√≠urrr i i ^ r¬∞^^ ¬´t if vr i√∂ ¬Æy=i oii=r √§=¬´i=i /√¢ ini=rsi√≠urrr SLi i i ^¬ª^^ r¬∞^^ bzi n c^m yv^L'√®^7 li EL' i SS f^sJoi i i^_ in /j ^ 0^o JJ l| ^^iL^Linl^LL‚Ñ¢ ^P ¬Æo It 5 'iffi a ^ √Æ&amp; k ¬£ s ^ Sfl ¬Æu ¬øf√ü &lt;l.Y ^^A _^s ¬Æu &lt;l.Y ^^A P I ii Insciptions on the coffin of Dismutenibtes 18 RO.

Bettum SAK 39 1.4 Interpretation of unusual elements in the decoration Most of what is described above is part of the standard repertoire of decorations on the late TIP coffins, and is analyzed elsewhere. One scene however, is to my knowledge unique. The large djed-pillar was a common motif on wooden coffins in the 21st and 22nd dynasty, but then always occurred on the inside floor of the case19. These ^¬ø/-pillars were usually of Amann's type I, not anthropomorphic, or III, semi-anthropomorphic with eyes, crown and arms crossed on the breast, but no human head20. The fully anthropomorphic type IV, with a human head seen in profile, is rare21. On the one-piece cartonnage cases that were in use from the 22nd to the 25th dynasty, the djed-pillars were moved to the rear body field, since only the exterior surfaces could be decorated22. This practise was continued on the inner wooden coffins of the 25th-26th dynasty, of which the coffin of Dismutenibtes is one example (see blow). As we have seen, the djed-pillar on the underside of Dismutenibtes' coffin is of type IV, the most anthropomorphic kind, with crossed arms and a head seen in profile (Taf. 5b). This is un- usual, particularly on the 25th-26th dynasty coffins, where the back pillars lacked the horizontal space necessary to include the crossed arms23. D/W-pillars on these coffins sometimes have arms extended above their heads, thus adding to the vertically of the scene24. The coffin of Dismutenibtes however, has no back pillar, and the horizontal space could be used freely. The uniqueness of this scene lies in the position of the arms, which seem to be crossed behind the pillar, and the sceptres protruding from behind the shoulders. These unusual features indicate that the god actually is depicted from behind, with his back situated against the pillar, and the front against the deceased inside the coffin. The divine beard, painted in front of the pillar, may confuse the modern spectator, but is in full accordance with the 'aspectivity' of Egyptian art25. 19 See for instance A. Niwinski, 21st dynasty coffins from Thebes. Chronological and typological studies, Mainz am Rhein 1988, pl. 19b, 22b, 23, Taylor, Theban coffins from the Twenty-second to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, pl. 59. A. Bettum, Death as an eternal process - a case study of a 21st dynasty coffin at the University Museum of Cultural Heritage in Oslo (MA-thesis, University of Oslo, 2004), 156 (pdf available on http://www.duo.uio.no). By 'large djed-pi''ars' I mean djed-piMars that dominate the decorations on the bottom of coffins, either on the interior or the exterior. The special context of the large djed-pi''ars calls for a different interpretation than their smaller counterparts found elsewhere in the funerary equipment, even when the icono- graphy is similar. 20 A.-M.

The coffin of Itneb (BM EA 6693) is a late example, where a type HI pillar with crossed arms is awkwardlv oainted on the back-oillar. 24 One example is BM EA 25256, where this type occurs both on the inside and the outside of the base; Taylor, Theban coffins from the Twenty-second to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, pl. 66, 68.

The djed-pill&amp;r symbolized the backbone of Osiris, and is therefore often located close to the back of the mummy. By depicting the god from behind, the artist indicates that the god is facing the deceased inside the coffin, thus emphasizing the association of the two. Scenes where avian deities spread their wings across the exterior of the lid may be interpreted in a similar way. In these scenes, the head is seen in profile, and the innermost parts of the wings frequently cover the body27, indicating that the viewer is looking at the back of a bird. Again, the artist has achieved a closer association between the god and the deceased inside the coffin. The former can in this case be regarded as hovering above the mummy, a well known scene form funerary objects and papyri. The solution provided by this artist was probably experimental, and is not likely to have occurred again. What became the norm was to depict djed-pillars of type I or III in this posi- tion. Another unusual element in the decoration is the use of two different names for the two jackals on the sides of the feet, Anubis and Wepwawet. On the cartonnages of the 22nd-25th dynasty, both jackals are usually named Wepwawet. On the wooden 25th-26th dynasty coffins, both are usually named Anubis28. The lack of interior decoration is also rare on coffins of this type. Usually, monochrome texts or line drawings would occupy the interior of both the lid and the base29. 7.5 Dating and place of origin based on stylistic and textual criteria According to Taylor's typology on Third Intermediate Period coffins, Dismutenibtes' coffin clearly belongs to the category of 25th-26th dynasty Theban inner coffins30. The following observations support this: 1) Both the lid and the base belong to the design class 1 in Taylor's typology (dyn. 25-26, wooden inner coffins). This type of coffins copied the decoration program of the 22nd dynasty cartonnages. The careful sculpting of the body to resemble the contours of the mummy, the orientation of decorations and texts so as to be viewed when the mummy was upright, the positioning of the large djed-pillar underneath the base and the scarab on the top of the head are all elements copied from the cartonnages31. The construction of the 'plastic' surface by use of linen and gesso, testify to the same source of inspiration32. 2) The Apis bull on the foot board is carrying a mummy. Up until the 25th dynasty, the bull was usually depicted without such a load33. 3) The pennant-spelling of the name Osiris in the texts gives a terminus post quern for the production of the coffin to about 720 BC34. 26 A.

Bettum S AK 39 4) The four sons of Horus in register 4 wear unguent cones of Taylor's type 3, which was introduced during the 25th dynasty and used exclusively in the 26th dynasty (Taf. 7c)35. 5) The anthropomorphic djed-pillar on the underside of the base displays the archaising features of the Kushite 25th dynasty. The exceptionally broad shoulders and muscular arms, as well as the 'contracted' lower part of the face, stylistically belong to the 25th and early 26th dynasty36. 6) The relatively bold vignettes, and their predominance over the texts, indicate a Kushite rather than a Saite origin37. 7) The coffin includes several unusual elements, such as the plaster seal, the short and un- pronounced pedestal, the lack of a back pillar, the undecorated interior surfaces, the experimen- tal large djed-pillar and the use of two names for the jackal deities on the sides of the feet. These features indicate that the coffin is of a transitory type, an early specimen of the wooden coffins which replaced cartonnages as the innermost shelter of the mummy in the 25th dynasty38. The points above suggest a mid 25th dynasty date for the coffin of Dismutenibtes, i.e. c 700 BC. 2 The coffin ofAaiu, C4770939 The coffin ofAaiu (Taf. 8-10) has a much simpler design than that of Dismutenibtes. A flat lid covers a deep case similar in shape to the wooden coffins used in the 21st-22nd dynasties. Apart from the facial mask, wig and collar, the exterior decorations contain no separate carvings or imagery, only three text bands painted directly onto the wood. Its size and design indicates that this coffin was intermediary or outer, and once contained an inner coffin of wood or car- tonnage. 2. 1 Technical data The lack of gesso gives the advantage of free insight to the materials used. The framework is constructed by a patchwork of small, irregular sized planks, held together by wooden dowels40. Yellow-brownish mud has been used as plaster to cover the cracks between the planks and other irregularities in the wood. A yellow wash was then applied to every surface of the coffin except the facial mask and collar on the exterior of the lid. The pigments used in the wash were ochre yellow and lead white. The wig and facial mask were covered with a white grounding before it was painted. Finally, the exterior of the lid was given a golden shine by use of varnish, 34 DA. Aston/J.H.

It has a complex history of deterioration and conservation. The coffin was probably intact when it arrived in the early 19th century45. In 1862, however, it is described as a pile of loose boards, which the curator Ludvig K. Daa pieced back together at some point before 186546. In order to reassemble the coffin, Daa had to insert several new boards of various sizes and shapes. The foot board and the entire bottom of the case were made in the 19th century. Two loose boards from the original bottom were nailed to the new one. Insertions of modern wood can also be found on the case walls at the head end (Taf. 10b), at the top of the head of the lid, and at the foot end of the right side (Taf. 9b). In the lid, five additional pieces are of modern date47. No attempt has been made to cover up these insertions, which makes them easily recognizable. With the exception of the top of the head, the missing pieces of original wood do not seriously interfere with decorations or texts. Daa pieced the original and modern planks together by use of glue, webbing and nails. The lid was strengthened by nailing transverse moulding to the inside. Like the original craftsmen, Daa made generous use of plaster to cover up the discrepancies between the boards48. The fre- quent use of nails is regrettable. However, the modern carpentry has probably not changed the overall visual impression of the coffin much. As we shall see below, in reassembling the many boards, Daa misplaced to my knowledge only one49. 41 E.

That year however, the coffin was brought out of storage and conserved by Eivind Bratlie. The surfaces with deco- rations were cleaned. The lid, which was about to fall apart, was secured from the inside50. In 2008, the coffin was on display in the temporary exhibition Death in Antiquity. 2.2 Inscriptions and decoration The coffin of Aaiu is equipped with a face, wig and floral collar which once must have resembled those of Dismutenibtes. The wig is tripartite, striped and has the floral fillet, but does not have the vulture headdress. Striped wigs were most commonly used on male coffins, but quite a few female coffins with striped wigs have been found as well51. All that remains of the decoration on the top of the head is half a sun-disc on a white background (Taf. 10b). The scene probably included a scarab before it was damaged. The collar covers less of the shoulders than that of Dismutenibtes, and lacks the stola. Otherwise it is similar in shape, size and patterning. The face is painted red, and due to damages of this region, it is not possible to say if the ears were protruding or not. The only other decoration on the exterior surface is the text- bands. Starting with the lid, a single text column containing the offering formula runs down the body from the collar to the feet. The text has been painted on to a single plank, located noticeably off centre to the viewers left. It is painted in a fine black line filled in with blue, and is framed by red border lines. It reads: Taf 8a, text 3: An offering which the king gives to Geb, the prince of the gods, so that he may give a voice offering of ox, fowl, bread, alabaster, linen and unguent, everything pure and clean on which the god lives, to the ka of the Osiris, Lady of the House, Aaiu. Single text bands also run along the centre field of the exterior case walls on both sides. Unlike the texts in the same position on the coffin of Dismutenibtes, these texts are written horizontally, indicating that the coffin was lying down during the burial ritual. Both texts start at the foot end, and continue around the case up to the top of the head, where they must have met before the head end was damaged (Taf. 10b). Like text 3, they are outlined in black, filled in with blue, and framed by red borders. Text 4 contains most of spell 59 of The Book of the Dead52. The texts read: Taf. 9a, 3d, text 4: Words spoken by the Osiris, Lady of the House, Aaiu: 4CO sycamore of Nut, may there be given to me the water and breeze which is in it53, for I am the one who sought out the throne in the heart of Wenu and I have guarded this egg [...]" Taf. 9b, text 5: [...] Ra-Horakhty54, Lord of the Gods, Ptah-Sokar, Lord of the Two Lands, (he who is in the) Shetyt-sanctuary, and Atum, Lord of the Two Lands, (he who is in) Heliopolis, so that they may give a voice offering of ox, fowl, bread, alabaster and ointment, everything pure and clean, and everything sweet and good to the Osiris, Lady of the House, Aaiu. 50 Ibid., 6-7. 51 Taylor, A priestly family of the 25th dynasty, 5 1 . 52 Faulkner/Goelet/Wasserman, The Egyptian Book of the Dead, pl. 16. 53 The reading of this word is discussed in Lieblein, Om de asgyptiske Oldsager i Universitetets ethnografiske Museum, 225-26. S4 The reading of Ra-Horakhty is uncertain and entails a reversal of normal sign order. Comparison with con- temporary coffins, such as BM EA 75193, 15654 and 25007 in the Vatican Museum, still makes the reading like- ly. I am indebted to John H. Taylor for these references.</page><page sequence="11">20 1 0 Dismutenibtes and Aaiu 6 1 Of the interior surfaces, only the case is decorated (Taf 8b). The two remaining boards from the original bottom show the outline of a goddess painted in red, blue and black. She is depicted en face, with her arms extending on to the side walls in an embrace of the mummy (Taf. 10a). The head gear, which could have identified her, is missing. On similar coffins she is usually identified as Nut or Hathor55. 2.3 Dating and place of origin based on stylistic and textual criteria The sparse use of decoration gives meagre grounds for a stylistic dating of the coffin of Aaiu. The exterior decorations belong to a design class that was in use during both the main periods of Taylor's typology (roughly corresponding to the 22nd and 25th-26th dynasties)56. One element in the decoration which can be used as dating criteria is the goddess on the interior of the case. This frontal type was in use from the early 22nd into the 25th dynasty, during which it was gradually replaced by a new type where the goddess is seen in profile57. As for textual dating criteria, we find again the pennant-spelling of the name Osiris, which provides a terminus post quern for the production of the coffin to about 720 BC. Following these two criteria, the coffin of Aaiu was probably produced between c 720 and 700 BC. 3 The relationship between the coffins As we have seen, the coffins of both Aaiu and Dismutenibtes have a Theban origin. Although dating criteria on Aaiu' s coffin are scarce, the few finds we have indicates a production date contemporary to that of Dismutenibtes. Other evidence, both internal and independent, supports this interpretation. 3. 1 Comparison of decoration and craftsmanship The coffins of Aaiu and Dismutenibtes belong to different parts of the ensemble, and should therefore be regarded as two different products. As such, the coffins are not directly com- parable, but details in the decoration certainly are. There are many similarities in the few decorative elements on Aaiu's coffin to the corresponding elements on the coffin of Dis- mutenibtes. Conservator Bratlie, whose field of expertise is paint conservation, has studied the painting technique and use of pigments under the microscope. He concludes that there is a striking similarity in the painting of stripes in the wigs, the patterning of the collars and exe- cution of the hieroglyphs in texts 1, 3, 4 and 558. These observations indicate that the two coffins were produced in the same workshop, and possibly painted by the same artist(s). 3.2 The earliest records The provenance of the coffins is not recorded, neither is it known exactly when the coffins arrived in Oslo. The earliest known document mentioning any of the objects is a letter dated mach 25th 184259. The letter is written from the "Academic board" to Professor R. Keyser, manager of MHC at the time60. In the letter, the board asks Keyser to receive and sign for the 55 Tavlor, Theban coffins from the Twenty-second to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. 109 56 Ibid., 108-09, 116. 57 Ibid., 109. 117. 58 Personal communication with Eivind Bratlie. 59 Det Akademiske Collegium, in: MCH Letter archive, vol. 1, nr. 1, 1842. 60 The museum has changed its name many times throughout history. For the sake of simplicity I will refer to the museum as "MCH" throughout the article. The museum was founded in 1817 under the name "Collection of</page><page sequence="12">62 A. Bettum S AK 39 transfer of some Siberian weapons and an Egyptian Mummy from The Zoological Museum to MCH. Since the other mummies and coffins in the collection arrived first in 1889 and 189461, the mummy mentioned can only be that of Dismutenibtes. In 1862, the earlier mentioned Ludvig K. Daa was appointed as the first curator of the collection. Soon after his appointment, he wrote a letter to Professor Rasch and Lecturer Esmark62, two zoologists working at the faculty of mathematics and science63. Daa wanted information about the mummy and the fragments of "the other mummy" that came with it. In the response from Professor Halvor H. Rasch64, who worked as curator at the Zoological Museum until 1847, we learn that the mummy originally was a gift to the University of Oslo from Giovanni Anastasi, the Consul-General of Sweden-Norway in Alexandria65. Rasch mentions an opening of the mummy, which took place soon after its arrival. He goes on to describe how the coffin was left open in the exhibition for several years, and complains about the audience, who helped themselves to souvenirs from the bandages. To prevent further deterioration of the wrappings, he had the lid put back on66. He vaguely mentions the use of glue as a means to attach the lid to the base, probably a reference to the paper tape seal des- cribed above. In his article from 1876, Daa claims that the sealing, which then also included two steel wires, was intact until 1875, when he himself broke it in order to examine the mummy a second time67. These facts, as well as the chronologic arrangement of Rasch's letter, from the arrival to the transfer in 1842, indicates that the first opening took place at the Zoo- logical Museum, and not at the MCH, as suggested by Mahdy68. Rasch was not present at the first opening himself, but names two professors who were; the scientist Jens Rathke and the 'expert on Oriental languages', Cristopher A. Holmboe69. Rasch does not give a specific date for the arrival of the mummy at the Zoological Museum, but states that it had been on display for several years before the transfer to MCH.

Personal communication.</page><page sequence="13">2010 Dismutenibtes and Aaiu 63 his first shipment of Egyptian antiquities to Europe that year71, some of which ended up in Sweden72. This latter point is important since Norway was part of a union with Sweden at that time. The donation of four 21st dynasty coffin ensembles to King Oscar II of Sweden-Norway in 1893 might very well provide a parallel example. Although officially donated to the king, the coffins were distributed between museums in the two capitals73. In Rasch's letter, we also learn that "the fragments of a second mummy" mentioned by Daa was at arrival an intact coffin, and enclosed the first one. This indicates that the coffins were donated as one ensemble, which further explains why the three objects simply are referred to as "the mummy" in the earliest records. The first Egyptologist to take a closer look at the coffins after their arrival in Norway was Jens D. C. Lieblein. In an article he published on the Egyptian objects in the collection in 1866, he included a passage about the coffins74. Lieblein translated the hieroglyphic inscriptions, and discovered the two different names on the coffins. Perhaps unaware that they arrived as an ensemble, he concluded that the coffins belonged to two different ladies, the smaller one to Dismutenibtes, and the larger one to Aaiu. He claims, however, that the coffins probably originated from the same family tomb, since the father of Dismutenibtes, Hotepamun, also was recorded with full name and title on Aaiu' s coffin75. However, the family relationship between Aaiu and Hotepamun could not be established, due to the fragmentary state of the text. After thorough examination by conservator Bratlie and myself, we had to conclude that this text was lost, if it ever was there at all. Lieblein' s observation was a mystery. He did not reproduce the text in his article, nor did he mention where it was located. The lacunas in the texts on Aaiu's coffin were not large enough to contain such a long string of hieroglyphs, and it was highly unlikely to have been located in any of the damaged areas. On the other hand, it was hard to dismiss an observation described so precisely by a qualified scholar. Then, on what was supposed to be our last look at the coffin before publication, we made a discovery. The coffin was then on display, and in the spot light, faint lines of paint could be seen on the left foot. On closer examination, it turned out to be the continuation of the central text on the lid (text 3), continuing on a board located a few cm to the (mummy's) left of the centre (Taf 8a, second board from the right in the foot piece). Daa must have misplaced a board either in the foot or in the body of the lid. At the present, we cannot say which. Unfortunately, the text is too worn for comfortable reading. After thorough examination, including the use of IR-photography, only 4-5 signs can be identified (text 6). After a discrepancy caused by the missing plaster in the joint between the body of the lid and the foot piece, the text continues with s√¨w-c√¨ Imn, the only groups that can be read with certainty. After a discrepancy the length of about half a square sign-group is a horizontal sign, probably the beginning of Hotepamun' s name ( ¬∞ ). It must be concluded that the title could not have been spelled the same way as on Dismutenibtes' coffin. It could, however, be an abbreviated version of the title (perhaps slw-ri pr-lmn), an assumption which corresponds well with the limited Dawson, Anastasi, Saluer, and Harris and their papyri, 159. This shipment is not mentioned in HD. Schneider, Egypt outside Egypt, in: C. Morigi Govi (ed.) L'Egitto fuori dell'Egitto. Dalla riscoperta ali' Egittologia. Bologna 199L 399. " B.

Bettum S AK 39 space available at the end of the column. With only one sign of the name readable, Lieblein' s observation can hardly be said to be confirmed. However, the discovery of the missing text has restored Lieblein' s credibility. With the reservations with regard to the spelling of the title, I do not hesitate to accept his reading from 1866, when the text must have been more readable than now. We can also take Lieblein's conclusion a step further. Today we know that when only one male relative is mentioned in a genealogical text on coffins from this period, it is always the father of the deceased. Aaiu and Dismutenibtes were therefore either sisters or one and the same person. 3.3 A new lead In March 2006, I was contacted by the Belgian Egyptologist Bart Hellinckx, who at the time was studying the coffins in Muse√© Curtius in Li√®ge for a new catalogue of the collection76. On one of the coffins he was about to publish (Li√®ge, I/628A =Eg. 83 A), he found the name Dis- mutenibtes recorded as mother of the deceased. The name is rare, and is not recorded in the standard works on Egyptian personal names77. As he came across the name on an MCH web page, Hellinckx followed up to see if there could be a connection. The Li√®ge coffin in question is the outer coffin of Osirmose78. It is of approximately the same date as the coffin of Dismutenibtes, and can also be traced back to Giovanni Anastasi79. There are good reasons to believe that Osirmose in Li√®ge is the son of Dismutenibtes in Oslo. The evidence for this con- clusion, as well as its wider implications, will be published elsewhere80. Of interest to our problem however, is the reference to Osirmose' s mother on the lid of the Li√®ge coffin by what appears to be a pet name: Iuiu81. With a rare and complicated name such as Dismutenibtes, it is not surprising that she also had a nickname. Pet names like this were common in all periods in Ancient Egyptian history82, as they are today. The question is of course, if Iuiu ( i^n 83) and Aaiu ( √ú√âAI^ ) could be variant spellings of the same pet name. Since such names were part of the oral tradition, flexible spelling is to be expected. It is also likely there was a time gap between the production of the coffins of mother and son, which would increase the probability of variations in spelling. Although there is no definite proof that Aaiu and Dismutenibtes/Iuiu were one and the same person, the documented existence of a pet name downplays the problem of different names considerably. 4 Conclusions The coffins of Dismutenibtes and Aaiu were donated to the University of Christiania by Giovanni Anastasi at some point before 1842, possibly as part of his first shipment of anti- quities to Europe in 1826. After Lieblein revealed the existence of two different names on the coffins in 1866, the connection between them was lost to the collective memory of the 76 See now B.R Hellinckx, Cercueils et cartonnages, in: E.

In this article, the connection has been reintroduced based on the following observa- tions: Based on analysis of style, iconography and texts, both coffins seem to be of Theban origin, and can very well have been produced at the same time (c 700 BC). C47708 is an inner coffin; C47709 is an intermediary or outer coffin. The measures prove that they would fit well together. According to conservator Bratlie, painting technique and use of pigments indicate that the two coffins were decorated in the same workshop. Both coffins were donated by Anastasi, and they arrived together with a single mummy as one ensemble. The discovery of Lieblein' s lost text proves that Dismutenibtes and Aaiu had the same father. The discovery of the coffin of Dismutenibtes' son in Li√®ge proves that Dismutenibtes had a pet name that resembles the name Aaiu. Although the points above indicate that we are dealing with one ensemble, conclusive evidence is still missing, and further research is necessary to solve this and other problems. It seams clear that Anastasi' s agents excavated a Theban family tomb, which contents today are located in various European museums. Other objects from this tomb have in fact been found. In addition to the outer coffin of Osirmose in Li√®ge, already mentioned, these objects include the inner and intermediary coffins of Osirmose in Brussels (MRAH E 5889 B-C) and the cartonnage and coffin of Padiamunet in The British Museum (EA 6√ì82-3)84. Future research may reveal more objects belonging to the "Padiamunet-group". Related to this is the enigmatic "first shipment" of Egyptian antiquities made by Anastasi in 1826, reported by Dawson and confirmed by George, but not mentioned by Schneider (see above). A through study of the cir- cumstances of this shipment would be of great value to Scandinavian Egyptology. It should also be possible in the future to re-establish the history of the coffins' first years in Oslo. My only source to the events that took place while the coffins were in the possession of the Zoological Museum, is the eyewitness account in the letter from Halvor Rasch, written several decades after the events took place. The information gathered from this letter needs confirmation and expansion by contemporary sources, which I believe can be found. The arrival of a mummy and the subsequent first opening are not likely to have passed unnoticed in Norway in the early 19th century. After spending weeks in various archives, I have only glimpsed at the well of newspapers, magazines, journals and official documents in which these events could have been recorded, let alone the mass of handwritten correspondence and per- sonal notes left by the professors named above. The process of digitalizing some of these sources is under way, and will facilitate future research. Finally, the technical analyses of materials and pigments have just started, and the mummy itself has not yet been examined. Unfortunately, the MCH has so far not prioritized research on the Egyptian collection, and it may be up to external scholars to take these studies further. The relationship between Osirmose and Padiamunet was first suggested in M. Malaise, Antiquit√©s √©gyptiennes et Verres du Proche-Orient ancien des Mus√©es Curtius et du Verre √† Li√®ge, Li√®ge 1971, 33-34. It should be noted that Malaise's reconstructions of coffin ensembles and genealogies otherwise have been dis- missed.
