<plain_text><page sequence="1">MELISSA FEUERSTEIN For Want of a Door: Poetry's Resistant Interiors IN HER INTRODUCTION to The Best American Poetry of 1990, Jorie Graham describes an experience of listening to a poem, wanting to grasp its meaning, and then being "compelled ... to let go." This letting go, however, had unex pected gains: the motion of the poem as a whole resisted my impulse to resolve it into "sense" of a rational kind. Listening to the poem, I could feel my irritable reaching after fact, my desire for resolution, grasp able meaning, ownership .... It resisted. It compelled me to let go. The frontal, grasping motion frustrated, my intuition was forced awake. I felt myself having to "listen" with other parts of my sensibility .... And I saw that it was the resistance of the poem—its occlusion, or difficulty—that was healing me. (xvi) Graham's repeated use of the word resist conveys the mind's insistent "grasping motion" at the same time as it turns that resistance into the experience's only "graspable meaning." As this meaning, resistance proves "healing" partly because it provides the kind of palpability that Graham initially sought through "reach ing after fact" and a "frontal, grasping motion." Indeed, the physicality of the mind's motion is matched by an equally physical experience of the poem's resis tance: "I found myself feeling, as the poem ended, that some crucial muscle that might otherwise have atrophied from lack of use had been exercised" (xvi). Under standing is experienced as a process rather than a product, and, through that pro cess, the mind is able to "let go." Although in the shift from "reaching" and "grasp ing" to letting go an image of empty-handedness persists, healing has occurred nevertheless. And although letting go is the gesture par excellence of psychic health and repair, Graham emphasizes that in this instance "it was the resistance of the poem—its occlusion, or difficulty—that was healing me." The connection Graham draws between resistance and healing suggests the workings of a particular kind of poetic difficulty and a form of repair or consola tion that encounters with that difficulty offer. By defining the "difficulty" of the poem's resistance as a difficulty of "occlusion," she casts both her "reaching after fact" and her "frontal, grasping motion" as manifestations of the mind's desire not only for "graspable meaning," but also for easy access to that meaning. That This essay is dedicated to Barbarajohnson, whose patient insistence that I thematize rather than agonize my difficulty writing about these poems was the project's starting point. I am grateful to her, Lynne Rossi, George Rowe, Stephanie Sandler, Keja Valens, and the anonymous reviewers of Comparative Literature for their invaluable comments on different versions of the essay. Comparative Literature 64:2 DOI 10.1215/00104124-1590146 © 2012 by University of Oregon</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 208 is, by signifying a literal blocking-up of an opening, a figurative blocking-out of thought, and even a mental block, the "occlusion" challenges the notion that understanding involves movement—physical or psychological—from a position of exteriority to an accessible interiority where meaning resides. Graham's account evokes several textual metaphors on which this essay will draw: poem as three-dimensional space, poem as object, and poem as person. Following Barbara Johnson's observation that having both an inside and an out side makes the "thing, the human, the poem, and indeed language itself" into metaphors for each other {Feminist Difference 130), I use Graham's link between poetic difficulty and occlusion as a way to examine the difficulties of entering into, or accessing, alien experience byway of lyric poems. More broadly, I find in imagined encounters with resistant interiors answers to the question of what it means to want to know or relate to an other; I argue that poetry's potential for repair resides in the restoration rather than the resolution of that resistance. I develop this argument in readings of a series of poems chosen not for their particular national traditions but because of the way they negotiate the divide between inside and outside and because of their range of resistant interiors. Wil liam Butler Yeats's "The Fascination of What's Difficult" (1910) shows a mind locked inside the creative process finding release by laboring against the poem's own mechanisms of resistance. Jorie Graham's "The Way Things Work" (1980) and "The Age of Reason" (1983) dramatize ethical explorations of the equation of knowing with entering, honesty with openness, whereas in "Rozmowa z kamie niem" ("Conversation with a Stone" [1962]) Wislawa Szymborksa presents a liter ally impenetrable stone as the enigmatic and inaccessible other whose world she wants to experience. The sense that the world of the resistant object is the world not only of the other but also of the poem is further explored in Francis Ponge's "Introduction au galet" ("Introduction to the Pebble"), "Un rocher" ("A Rock"), and "Rhetorique" ("Rhetoric" [1948]). Depicting the difficulty presented by lan guage as something to reign in, subjugate, and violate, Ponge raises the ethical stakes of a poetics of resistance, stakes that Anne Carson embraces in her short prose poem "On Shelter" (1992). As in the poems by Yeats, Szymborska, and Ponge, the depiction of resistance in Carson's "On Shelter" depends on the image of a door, the motivating figure of want—as both desire and lack—that this essay's title names. Whether the door is metaphorical or imaginary, a locked door, a trapdoor, or a door off its hinges, elements both of interiority and exteriority, of access and occlusion, of openness and remoteness inhere. I am here interested in the ways that resistance helps poetry function as a space between these paired entities. In his theory of transitional objects D.W. Winncott posits a "between" space of experience—a space of play, illusion, and risk that teaches the individual to tolerate and accept frustration, separation, loss of power, reality. This essay grows out of a sense that poetry's resistance functions in much the same way. Resistance The notion of resistance, as Steven Monte notes (1136), has been central to studies of poetic difficulty, from George Steiner's classic "On Difficulty" to James</page><page sequence="3">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 209 Longenbach's The Resistance to Poetry. Attempting to define exactly "what we mean by 'difficulty,'" Steiner invokes texts that are "opaque, resistant to immediacy and comprehension" and that "generate impenetrability and undecidabilities of sense." However, because such definitions rely on ideas of "'inside'/'outside' . . . and the crucial 'between' with its innocent postulate of a kind of mental space," Steiner finds them problematic insofar as they "activate a metaphor of separation and transfer" (18). Yet metaphors involving inside and outside, mental space, and sepa ration and transfer continually crop up in critical discussions of poetic "difficulty" and, as such, point to the moral stakes that underpin those discussions by suggest ing the ways in which we project notions of agency, will, and a kind of moral choice onto poems that resist our attempts to grasp them. Reginald Shepherd comments that "it's often said that 'difficult' poems exclude potential readers" (35). And, indeed, Leonard Diepeveen describes aesthetic difficulty as "a barrier to what one normally expected to receive from a text" and as "the experience of one's desires for comprehension blocked" (x). Steiner uses terms that are more morally inflected when he refers to textual difficulty as "an act of semantic privacy" in rela tion to which reading becomes an act of aggression, a violation: "we are not meant to understand at all, and our interpretation, indeed our reading itself, is an intru sion" (45). The relation between text and reader is thus animated as a relation between self and other. And if Vernon Shetley is right to point out that such poetic "difficulty is not an inherent quality of texts but rather a particular kind of rela tion between author and reader" (4), then it is perhaps this sense of relation that best accounts for our tendency to personify a difficult text and anthropomorphize its interior and exterior spaces. With such relational figurations come metaphors not only of access, exclu sion, and intrusion, but also of communication. Thus, Howard Nemerov, describ ing the experience of reading "a poetry somewhat deeply enciphered," writes that "you have to talk with it awhile before it will say what it's about" (78). But what of the poem that refuses to open up? Nemerov himself notes that, while some poetry "has the clear intention of communicating—meanings," other poetry "has the clear intention of deepening the silence and space about itself" (29-30). Might this deepening itself be a form of communication, so that difficulty might possess its own meanings? I refer here not to poems that take difficulty as an end in itself, but to those that communicate the difficulty of their material, be that the nature of poetry and poetic language or any matter or entity that resists swift comprehension or resolution.1 In his study of lyric obscurity, Daniel Tiffany critiques literary theory's con cept of "difficulty" as "a condition always susceptible, in principle, to the resto ration of meaning," a "problem that may be resolved through interpretation." Such an approach, he continues, exhibits "blind faith in the efficacy—or the desirability—of 'reading'" and fails "to come to terms with the phenomenology of unknowing" (6). I contend that one of the tasks of difficulty is to undermine preconceptions regarding "effective" reading in order to enable readers to learn 1 Although he stays within the paradigm of failure, Shetley similarly suggests that "difficulty— the absence or failure of communication—is itself a form of communication; it communicates, if nothing else, itself." Shetley is referring specifically to a modernist version of difficulty that "com municates an idea about the nature of poetry" and "functioned to educate readers, to tutor them in the kinds of demands that a poet's work made" (11).</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 210 from the experience of unknowing. In so doing, I echo James Longenbach's asser tion that, "especially when it has something urgent to say, a poem's power inheres less in its conclusions than in its propensity to resist them" (Resistance to Poetry 10). For Longenbach, "we read for the resistance, not in spite of it" (xii); we read, in other words, not to escape difficulty but to wrestle and come to terms with it. Longenbach focuses on what he calls "poetic self-resistance" (xi)—the mecha nisms by which poems undermine the very conclusions they move inevitably toward and thereby resist being taken as facile containers for experience. This essay is interested less in poetry's resistance to itself—to its language and lyric devices—than in the ways that this resistance functions in self/other relation ships. I will argue that our encounters with difficult poems dramatize and illumi nate these relationships. Longenbach points toward this more ethical dimension of poetic resistance at the very end of his book, asserting that "poetry's greatest power is to instill in us a craving for something other than poetry: the person, not the statue, is the wonder" (107). Poetry's resistance, in other words, sends us back to the reality of the other; it prevents us from choosing the aesthetic as a wholly satisfying substitute for that which we can never fully grasp, for that which is real because it remains to a certain extent remote. In short, it is the way in which truth is not quite beauty, nor beauty truth, that keeps us coming back for more. Resistance and Release William Butler Yeats's poem "The Fascination of What's Difficult" addresses explicitly the question that the other poems I discuss in this essay raise more implicitly: what leads poets to seek out objects that seem especially resistant to their inquiries, aims, and desires? For Yeats, the answer is that laboring with that which is difficult provides an unexpected means of release. I quote his poem in full: The fascination of what's difficult Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent Spontaneous joy and natural content Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt That must, as if it had not holy blood Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud, Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays That have to be set up in fifty ways, On the day's war with every knave and dolt, Theatre business, management of men. I swear before the dawn comes round again I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt. (93) Yeats begins by blaming the "fascination of what's difficult" for draining him of vitality and spoiling life's pleasures. Defining this vitality as the life-force that coursed through his "veins" and the pleasures as "spontaneous" and "natural" products of the "heart," Yeats implies that the fascination is both unhealthy and unnatural—that "something" which "ails our colt." However, because the colt functions as a reference to Pegasus, favorite of the Muses and symbol of poetic inspiration, there is nothing natural about it. Coming down from Olympus and struggling "As though it dragged road metal," the colt represents the mind laboring under "the fascination of what's difficult."</page><page sequence="5">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 211 The colt is itself the subject of an extended metaphor that occupies the mid dle part of Yeats's poem. The aside that begins with "as if" breaks up the asser tion that the colt's work is compulsory by separating "must" from "shiver" and the list of exertions that follows. This complicates the syntax of the sentence, making the metaphor difficult to decipher. Similarly, the alternation of seem ingly literal statements ("There's something ails our colt," which is "Shiver[ing] under lash, strain, sweat and jolt") with figurative asides ("as if it had not holy blood" and "As though it dragged road metal") obscures the distinction between fiction and reality, so that the "ail [ing] colt" and the imagination it incarnates exist somewhere between the two. However, as the poem moves from the heights of Olympus, where the winged creature "leaped from cloud to cloud," to the road along which the workhorse "strain [s]" and "sweats," it seems to gain momen tum from the vitality of the language of labor. The extended metaphor is itself a kind of labor, the imagination's attempt to get at that "something," to understand the "fascination of what's difficult." In this sense, it is not only the work, but also the fascination itself that is difficult, and the poem, while offering evidence of this difficulty, also demonstrates through its lyri cal progression the value of the work it requires. Thus, when Yeats's metaphor comes to an end, the poet's voice emerges from the metaphorical detour invigo rated and unencumbered: "My curse on plays / that have to be set in fifty ways, / On the day's war with every knave and dolt, / Theatre business, management of men." Rather than "dr[y] the sap out of [ . . . ] veins," the sensation of difficulty creates the energy that keeps us working and gives us the means to imagine that our efforts will succeed. Yeats concludes his poem with an image of release—"I swear before the dawn comes round again / I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt"—closely connected to mechanisms of restraint ("stable" and "bolt"). In other words, if the bolt con fines the colt, it (and the door it implicitly keeps shut) also establishes a way out. That which is difficult—that which challenges, burdens, and confounds—thus engages and ultimately unlocks the imagination. Without the colt and its "lash, strain, sweat and jolt" there would be no stable, no bolt, and no means of express ing the life-giving release that the poem, in its grappling with that which is diffi cult, enacts. This progression is realized in the rhyming of "colt," "jolt," "dolt," and "bolt"—a series that stems from and returns to "difficult." This path through rhyme, which is itself a product of aesthetic labor and limitation, suggests that the horse represents not only the imagination, but also poetry itself—the work that it does and the effort it demands. Ultimately, "The Fascination of What's Difficult" suggests that difficulty is a worthy fascination because the exertion it requires opens doors that were previ ously unknown, if not altogether absent. Through its "strain" and "sweat," the imagination sees a way out that it would not have sought or even sensed had it not been locked into its work. But what if the search were for a way in rather than a way out, with difficulty experienced as a version of Graham's "occlusion," a door that was bolted from the inside in order to keep out the metaphorical colt? What if the assimilative metaphorical work that led to the door's discovery were challenged, exposing the door as a trick, a trap, or an illusion of access? In the poems to which I now turn, the fascination focuses on getting in rather than out. Whereas in Yeats the inclination toward that which demands hard work</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 212 ensures that difficulty comes from within, in these poems, difficulty must come from without, and the objects closest at hand prove challenge enough—whether that challenge is actively sought or unexpectedly encountered. Getting to the Heart of Things Criticizing Jorie Graham's notoriously "difficult" verse for "demand [ing] 'read ings' even as it resists reading" (36), Adam Kirsch employs the image of a door when he reproaches Graham for "guard [ing] ... the master key that might unlock the poem" (38). Furthermore, when Kirsch goes on to complain that Graham's poems "dwell in the poet's mind, and not in the public realm where poet and reader discuss things in common" (41), he assumes a relationship between self and other whose possibility is undermined by the poems' difficulty. Yet Graham's poetry both thematizes and rigorously investigates the ethical stakes of precisely this set of interlocking issues—the tension, that is, between openness and closure, interior and exterior, self and other. Indeed, in her work the tension between self and other unfolds alongside, or through, the tensions between interior and exte rior, openness (or open-endedness), and what Longenbach calls the "'click' of closure," whose "beauty" and "perfection," he argues (Modern Poetry 164), Graham affirmed in her 1983 collection Erosion. Throughout that collection, Graham represents the desire to know as a move ment "into" things. In the volume's opening poem, "San Sepolcro," Graham defines this movement as a basic human drive: "This is / what the living do: go in" (3). However, "It's a long way," and just as the entrance "keeps opening / from eter nity // to privacy," such that each glimpse of meaning's outermost limits returns the self to its innermost senses, so the mind, as "something terribly / nimble fingered," gets a grip on opening, entering, and knowing only by "finding all of the stops." In keeping with Graham's account of a poem's resistance to her desire to understand, with which this essay begins, many of the poems in Erosion not only "com[e] alive in the gap generated by resistance" (Gardner 115) but also show that knowledge resides as much in the resistance—the "stops"—as in the "go [ing] in."2 Indeed, the things that resist our going in and obstruct our access to the point of challenging our assumption that they even have an interior to reveal provide the deepest sense of what Graham describes as "the way things work" in the open ing poem (with the same title) of her first collection, Hybrids of Plants and Ghosts (1980). Like "San Sepolcro," "The Way Things Work" hinges on the very question of "opening": "The way things work," the poem begins, "is by admitting / or open ing away" (3). The alternate meanings of "admitting"—letting in and divulging or confessing—are emphasized by the use of "opening away," which evokes at once the admission—as both physical entrance and psychic disclosure—of "opening up" and the guided yet fluid expansion—physical, perceptual, or both—of "open 2 Bonnie Costello argues that the focus in "San Sepolcro" on Piero della Francesca's painting "The Madonna del Parto" suggests "that the mediation of iconic representation controls many of the poems in their understanding of the relationship between the body and the spirit" (23). Costello further argues that Graham's repeated depictions of a "permeable inside/outside opposi tion" (15) in the volume encourages readers "to draw the 'outside' world into the 'inside' structures of thought and representation" (18). This "drawing-in," however, seems very different from the "going-in" that Graham describes, and which I emphasize, in "San Sepolcro."</page><page sequence="7">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 213 ing onto."3 Graham returns to and refines the image several lines later when she describes "objects of desire" "opening upon themselves." The phrase suggests an unprompted self-revelation, a natural unfolding that comes from the objects themselves and that occurs, as Graham specifies, "without us." Indeed, this open ing-upon is no more a satisfaction of our desires than it is a yielding to them, for the result of objects "opening upon themselves" is not necessarily an opening in the sense of a letting-in, or a disclosure of anything beyond the opening-upon itself. If there is something more, it is based on trust rather than the fulfillment of desire. "Objects of desire" become "objects of faith" because they "work"—in the sense both of operating and of succeeding—in this way. Turning the title into an almost incantatory refrain (it is repeated three times), the poem continues: The way things work is by solution, resistance lessened or increased and taken advantage of. (Hybrids 3) Whether this means that things work when we "take advantage of" their resis tance, or when things themselves take advantage of resistance as a means of reso lution, is unclear. In any case, the two are mutually dependent. Indeed, the phrase "taken advantage of" implies respect for the resistance of matter—that we take things on their own terms, being attentive to and acting in accordance with the given degree of resistance so that things will "open upon themselves" as they are meant or even inclined to do. For, when the desire to know expresses itself as a desire to move into things, the idea of things "open [ing] upon themselves" no longer works.4 In "At Luca Signorelli's Resurrection of the Body," Graham writes that "there is no / entrance, / only entering" (Erosion 75). Drawing on these lines, Longenbach asserts that Graham "plays with different notions of 'entering,' groping for the place at which mechanisms of violence and love seem too similar to pull apart" (Modern Poetry 164). Graham finds such a place in "The Age of Reason," the third and final section of which begins with another image of potentially endless enter ing or moving into: How far is true enough? How far into the earth 3 The two connotations of "admitting" resonate with Kirstin Hotelling Zona's characterization of the "dance between autonomy and contingency" (669) that charts Graham's desire to go, in Gra ham's own words, "into a more moral terrain—a terrain in which one is more accountable" (667). Zona writes: "Whereas 'sincerity' (a supposed hallmark of 'confessional' poetry and poetry of the personal lyric) culls authority from the illusion of a coherent, if threatened selfhood, what Graham calls 'self-consciousness' (often associated with 'avant-garde,' 'postmodern,' or 'experimental' poet ics) locates agency in the act of tracing one's contingency, in rebuking revelation and apparitions of closure" (669). As "divulging," "admitting" registers the concept of "sincerity" and the lyric "I" of confessional poetry; as "letting in," it suggests the ruptured referent of the contingent self, whose "socially-constructed nature . . . locates identity at the nexus of 'external' influences" (668). 4 Cf. Zona, who argues in relation to Graham's later poems that, for Graham, it is "the dialectic between self and other, or autonomy and contingency, that widens one's ethical reach" (672). In her view, Graham's poetic "provides a timely framing of the pluralistic state of American poetry, a call to read ostensibly antithetical styles [i.e., personal/impersonal, confessional/experimental] as in fact powerfully symbiotic" (670).</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 214 can vision go and still be love? (Erosion 19) The first question equates degrees of truth with distance traveled, introducing a surprising twist on the expected absolutism of truth through the line break. The second question, however, implies that pursuing truth in this way—seeking a point that will define it as "enough"—can only go so far before it expresses some thing other than "love," that is, before its motivations for knowing reveal them selves as more complex than love or concern. Insight, Graham suggests, is not determined by "[h]ow far" vision can "go" but by the moments when the object resists that penetrating vision and turns away our searching gaze. By calling this resistance the "honesty / of things," Graham recalls the double meaning of the "admitting"—physical access and psychic disclosure — that characterizes the way things work. In her essay "Against Sincerity," Louise Gliick explains that by " honesty or sin cerity" she means '"telling the truth,'" which, she emphasizes, "is not necessarily the path to illumination" (33).5 Similarly, in "The Age of Reason," the "honesty / of things"—their truthfulness, integrity, and openness—is "where they resist" the idea of apprehension as a process of going or getting in. Graham's question "Isn't the / honesty / of things where they / resist" implies that something besides resistance is mistakenly perceived as "honesty." If in "The Way Things Work" the notion of "admitting or opening away" reminds us that "being honest" is com monly associated with "being open" or "opening up"—an idea that Graham undermines with the unexpected image of "opening away"—in "The Age of Rea son" her question about honesty addresses more directly the misguided desire to equate honesty with openness and to see "being open" as a kind of moral impera tive that would justify persistent efforts to "go in." The motivations behind such efforts are here challenged by the idea that the honesty of things is where they resist, where only the wind can bend them back, the real weather, not our desire hissing Tell me your parts that I may understand your body, your story. (19) In resisting the pressure of the wind, things bend and, in bending, avoid breaking. There is a yielding that comes from resistance and a resistance that persists through yielding. That the wind, rather than desire, elicits this combination is significant in that wind is pure movement driven by something ("the real weather") other than the desires of body or mind. By contrast, the wish to know, imagined as a process of entering, results in a conflation of body and mind—"your body, // your story"— that is the decisive and dangerous misstep whose implications the poem explores. 5 Gluck's characterization of the tendency to link truth with honesty as "a form of anxiety" that stems from a desire for "answerable questions" (33) resonates with some of the theories of poetic difficulty (Tiffany and Longenbach) that I mention at the beginning of this essay and suggests why Graham's particular mode of difficulty has been met with such resistance by some of her critics.</page><page sequence="9">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 215 The desire to "understand" the thing's "story" through a forced revelation of its "parts" does not produce, as does the wind's pressure, "honesty," the moment of "resistance lessened." "Which is why," adds Graham, we have characters and the knife of a plot to wade through this current. (19) Like the earlier image of vision making its way further and further into the earth, "to wade through" conveys a sense of progression, of the desire for knowl edge as a searching movement into things. And it is as if the pressure of the mind's pursuit has set the things themselves into motion—"this current"—and indeed, the perception of both "story" and "plot" invests them with a specifically narrative temporality and movement. This movement turns the process of know ing into a chase of sorts, making the mind's actions more aggressive and its instruments of understanding more dangerous. Presented here as a means of comprehension, a tool for getting at that which resists grasping, the "knife" that is Graham's image for narrative comes from her depiction, in the poem's second part, of the murder in Werner Herzog's film version of Georg Biichner's Woyzeck: "the hero whom / we love / who is mad" throws the knife with which he killed his wife into the river, but then, wondering if "it has / reached deep / enough," "goes in after it // himself. White as a knife" (17-18).6 Graham's emphasis on how the hero "has / murdered [...]/ and loved" anticipates the opening questions in the third section of the poem ("How far is true / enough? / How far into the / earth / can vision go and / still be // love?"). Indeed, by using the knife of plot to get at things that defy our desire to under stand them, "we"—poet and reader alike—are linked to the murderer/lover as we "wade through this / current" that resists our every step (for a very different reading of the poem, see Longenbach, Modern Poetry 164). For Helen Vendler the "stair-step" arrangement of alternating flush-left and indented lines in Gra ham's first two books embodies the poet's "process of step-by-step investigation of the world" and represents "a faith in the power of the patience of the mind; and in its deliberate respect for the resistance of matter, it intimates the 'beauty and care / and technique / and judgement' that the mind must observe in the precise investigative use of its various scalpels" (75, 77). Yet there is also a ten sion between this "faith" in the power of the mind's patience and an awareness of the caution such power requires, a caution which the poem's "stair-step" con struction and "step-by-step" progression also communicates. In contrast to the single solid column of text that constitutes "The Way Things Work," the staggered verse of the six-line stanzas in "The Age of Reason" creates a sense of openness—both formally, in its appearance on the page, and concep tually, in terms of the poem's investigative trajectory. This openness makes room for patience, but also for hesitation and uncertainty. Indeed, while the staggered lines have an openness that the solid column of text does not, they also produce enjambments within and, more importantly, across stanzas that create the effect 6 If Graham's comparison of plot to a knife resonates with her repeated condemnations of narra tive's seductive pull toward closure and resolution, her insistence that narrative is a "quest that pulls us not inward but outward into the web of connections from which our selves are spun" also makes it "the symptom of being-in-relation, and not its antecedent" (Zona 676).</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 216 of wavering between advancing and halting the poem's progression. Thus, the question "How far is true / enough?" does not express impatience with the pro cess of getting to truth as an identifiable destination, but rather concern about going too far, arriving at the point where "vision" or understanding is no longer "love." In this way, the stair-step composition creates a tension between closure and continuation, at once pushing forward and stalling the process of compre hension in a manner that tempers any sense of what Vendler describes as "faith" in the mind's patience. As a mode of understanding, going-in proves lethal rather than loving, omi nously embodied in the knife used by the hero "whom / we love" and who "has / murdered //[...]/ and loved" his wife and in the "knife of plot" that we use to get at things that resist our efforts to understand them. Perhaps resistance, then, is an expression of ambivalence about the nature of our efforts, so that the object's resistance protects it from impulses about which Graham seems genuinely uncer tain, even (and especially) as they drive her own poetic explorations. But this resistance does more than protect the object from the explorations that it conse quently enables. As an expression and experience of the "honesty" of things, resistance also keeps Graham honest in her inclination—the inclination of "the living"—to associate knowing with entering, honesty with openness, and truth with what we find on the inside. But, while Graham's emphasis on the value of occlusion and the psychic work it requires suggests that doors are not the way out of or, in her case, not the way into the difficulty of things, the need to establish an interior and an exterior as a frame work for the creative process remains. The poems to which I now turn use doors that are closed, locked, or otherwise impassible to create the possibility of a shelter ing interior in one of the objects least likely to have one: a solid, opaque, impene trable stone. Like Elizabeth Bishop's monument, which "may be solid, may be hol low" but "can shelter / what is within (which after all / cannot have been intended to be seen)" (25), these stones use resistance to raise questions about where, if not in an accessible interior, the object's capacity for sheltering meaning resides. Between a Rock and a Hard Place In her article "The Dream of Stone," Barbara Johnson demonstrates that resis tance is the essence of nineteenth-century French Parnassian poetry, which requires, and rejoices in, the difficulties presented by muse and material alike. This resistance is realized in both the stony linguistic matter that Theophile Gautier instructs poets to "Sculpte, lime, cisele" (sculpt, file, chisel) and the statues that are venerated in poem after poem for their imperviousness and unresponsive ness to the desires directed at them (Johnson, "Dream" 743). Stone thus emblema tizes the Parnassians' "aesthetic of desirable difficulty," which in turn celebrated "the irreducibility of a dimension of art—or even of human experience—that is precisely not equivalent to life" (745, 743). Lacking interiority, these statues force meaning into form; indeed, they make form the only meaning that matters. The poems to which I now turn reflect more ambivalently on the matter of stone— its hardness, impassivity, and resistance. Unlike the "reve de pierre" (dream of stone) in Baudelaire's "La Beaute" ("Beauty"), which inspires in poets "un amour /</page><page sequence="11">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 217 Eternel et muet ainsi que la matiere" ("a love / Eternal and mute, like matter itself"; Johnson, "Dream" 746), these stones elicit speech in the form of poems that attempt to think through and grasp the matter—both the physical substance and the substance of thought—that is at hand. Furthermore, if these poetic encounters with stone also express the problematic nature of identifying the self with an external, reified entity, they do so in a way that explores what it means to be human.

Winnicott explores the emergence of human subjectivity from the relation of the self to an inanimate object in his work on childhood development, defining transitional objects as the first "not me" possessions through which the subject learns to distinguish and relate to external reality, and which designate "an inter mediate area of experiencing... [that] shall exist as a resting-place for the individ ual engaged in the perpetual task of keeping inner and outer reality separate yet interrelated" (2). However, when later forced to recognize such an object "as an entity in its own right" (89), subjects find themselves not in a resting-place but in a place of psychic exertion, stuck, in a sense, between the proverbial rock and hard place—that is, between a resistant object whose otherness, if recognized as such, holds the key to a shared reality, and a mind whose fear, denial, and ambivalence make the work of acknowledging that otherness especially hard. Between a rock and a hard place is exactly where the speaker of Wislawa Szym borska's "Rozmowa z kamieniem" ("Conversation with a Stone") finds herself as she knocks again and again on the door of a stone, trying to convince it to let her in. In so doing, she (Polish grammar identifies this speaker as female) encounters two resistant matters at once: the stone, as physically impenetrable and immutable material, and also the enigmatic and unintelligible other that the stone repre sents. The poem is composed of six exchanges that begin identically: "Pukam do drzwi kamienia. /—To ja, wpusc mnie" (33; "I knock on the stone's door. / — It's me. Let me come in," Baranczak and Cavanagh 62).7 The tediousness of the refrain registers the speaker's persistent, unthinking resolve to get inside the stone. With each attempt, the speaker makes a new—but always unsuccessful— case for being admitted, for, as the stone says in the poem's closing line: "—Nie mam drzwi" (35; "I don't have a door," Baranczak and Cavanagh 64). However, it is not so much the lack of a door that makes entry impossible as it is the speaker's assumption that the stone has one, and that this door is the way in. Materializing the mind's preconceived frames of reference, the figure of the door represents how we find our way into thinking about and relating to what is external and other to the self. As such, it stands not only for physical access, but also for a form of mental access that our psychic frames provide. "Conversation with a Stone" shows that such access is not a given—that doors are not always open, if indeed they are there at all.8 71 have modified the first two lines of the refrain as translated by Barariczak and Cavanagh, who render them as follows: "I knock at the stone's front door. / It's only me, let me come in." Their addition of "front" and "only" lends a politeness and humility to the speaker's tone that is not con veyed by the original Polish. 8 For an examination of the '"human interest' of Szymborska's nature poems" (200), see Bojanow ska. While the poem does question the capacity of human consciousness to comprehend the world around it, the stone's declarations about its form and content complicate Bojanowska's claim that "Nature remains unaware, as it were, of its own nature" (201).</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 218 We can perhaps understand this clash between the presumption of accessibility and irrevocable remoteness more fully by considering Heidegger's claim that rec ognizing the remoteness of the thing helps rather than hinders our access to it. Addressing those moments when "we risk the attempt to bring to view and express in words the thingly character of the thing," he instructs: To this end . . . only one element is needful: to keep at a distance all the preconceptions and assaults ... of thought, to leave the thing to rest in its own thing-being. What seems easier than to let the being be just the being that it is? Or does this turn out to be the most difficult of tasks . . . ? We ought to turn toward the being, think about it in regard to its being, but by means of this think ing at the same time let it rest upon itself in its very own being. ("Origin" 31) In other words, insistently knocking on the stone's door is not the way to get inside. First, the very notion of a door must be dropped. To let go of this notion would be to let go of preconceptions of proximity and accessibility, recognizing that near ness lies in distance and understanding in remoteness. Only in this way do we "let the being be just the being that it is." Heidegger notes, however, that doing so "turn[s] out to be the most difficult of tasks." Winnicott highlights a similarly unexpected difficulty when he concludes that "recognition of [the object] as an entity in its own right" is "the most difficult thing, perhaps, in human develop ment" (89). For Heidegger, acknowledgement of the thing's otherness is difficult because it counters the mind's impulse to bring the world near in order to under stand it. For Winnicott, the difficulty comes from fearing the "destruction" that such an acknowledgement implies. However, both ultimately insist on the impor tance of treating the object as other, "in its very own being" and "as an entity in its own right." Heidegger asserts that "self-refusal," "self-contained [ness]" and "uncommunicative [ness]" "belong precisely to the nature of the thing" and there fore must be preserved by—indeed, "become intimately familiar to"—any "thought that tries to think the thing" ("Origin" 31-32). For to know the thing is, para doxically, to understand its unknowable essence, so that any attempt to "think the thing" must convey its uncommunicative, unthinkable nature. If we "force our way to its thingly character," we violate that character and also demonstrate our utter failure to grasp its nature. Although Szymborska's door also sets the stage for a negotiation of limits— between internal and external, self and other, person and thing—her stone, unlike Heidegger's "uncommunicative" thing, repeatedly attempts to communicate its "self-contained," unfathomable nature and to reveal the misguidedness of the speaker's prying approach. The speaker's first request expresses the desire not only to enter the stone and see its inside, but also to take in something of its essence, "nabrac ciebie jak tchu" (33; "breathe my fill of you," Barariczak and Cava nagh 62), to internalize it, however temporarily, as her own. Exulting in the bound aries that the speaker hopes to transcend and reveling in its utter impenetrability, the stone replies: —Odejdz [ . . . ] Jestem szczelnie zamkni^ty. Nawet rozbite na cz^sci bedziemy szczelnie zamkni^te. Nawet starte na piasek nie wpuscimy nikogo. (33) Go away [ . . . ] I'm shut tight.</page><page sequence="13">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 219 Even if you break me to pieces, we'll all still be closed. You can grind us to sand, we still won't let you in. (Barariczak and Cavanagh 62) A paradoxical indivisibility emerges from the stone's infinitely reducible, divisi ble form. As such, it defies definitions of the iconic self as whole, stable, and invulnerable in that its essence stays the same regardless of changes in size and shape. Shattering the Lacanian ideal of an indivisible, immutable "I," the stone can be broken down, broken up, but never broken open. Singular, fragmented, or ground to sand, its stony core remains invariably intact, self-contained, and defiantly closed. Continuing down the wrong path, the speaker proposes aesthetic and moral values as justification for entering. Pointing to the "wielkie puste sale" ("great empty halls") whose beauty, she claims, is "nadaremnie" ("in vain") because they are "nie ogladane" (33; "unseen," Barariczak and Cavanagh 62), the speaker attempts to raise the stakes by challenging the integrity of the stone's sense of self: "Przyznaj, ze sam nieduzo o tym wiesz" (34; "Admit you barely know them yourself," Baranczak and Cavanagh 62). But the moral imperative to know one self means nothing to the stone. The argument that the stone needs the speaker to confirm or validate its identity fails and, instead of putting into question the depth of the stone's self-knowledge, the speaker is confronted with the superficiality of her own sense of knowing: "Mozesz mnie poznac, nie zaznasz mnie nigdy. / Cala powierzchnia zwracam si? ku tobie, / a calym wn^trzem lez? odwrocony" (34; "You may get to know me, but you'll never know me through. / My whole surface is turned toward you, / all my insides turned away," Barariczak and Cavanagh 63). Adding the prefix "po-" and then "za-" to the root "znac" ("to know"), the stone invokes two kinds of knowing. The first, "poznac," has a preliminary, super ficial sense of recognizing, or getting to know, while "zaznac" connotes a more thorough, comprehensive knowledge, translating literally as "to know through" and more figuratively as "to experience." Here we might recall Winnicott's insistence on the need both for "an interme diate area of experiencing, to which inner reality and external life both contribute" (2) and for the subject's participation in a "shared reality" in which the object, having developed its own autonomy and life, "can feed back other-than-me sub stance into the subject" (94). Szymborska's stone points to a lack of experiential understanding and sense of reciprocity when it offers what is at once the most abstract and most clear-cut reason for refusing the speaker's request: Brak ci zmyslu udzialu. Zaden zmysl nie zastapi ci zmyslu udzialu. Nawet wzrok wyostrzony az do wszechwidzenia nie przyda ci si? na nic bez zmyslu udzialu. (34) You lack the sense of taking part. No other sense can make up for your missing sense of taking part. Even sight heightened to become all-seeing will do you no good without a sense of taking part. (Barariczak and Cavanagh 63) Whereas the stone's earlier reasons for denying entrance confirm the irrevocable separateness of its stone world, the explanation that the speaker lacks "zmyslu udzialu" ("the sense of taking part") feels almost human. Or, rather, it could be</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 220 the reproach of any person or thing situated as other to a subject who has in some way overlooked or overstepped the boundaries between self and other. Denied entry, Szymborska's speaker is prevented from overstepping the bound ary that the door represents. But, as the terse revelation of the door's non-existence suggests, a sense of violation lies in the very presumption of a door and the mode of relating it implies. The stone's rebuke that the speaker lacks the "sense of taking part" is a response to the speaker's most explicit expression of how she envisions her relation to the stone. Reassuring the stone that she is not seeking permanent shelter, that her "swiat jest wart powrotu" (34; "world is worth returning to," Baranczak and Cavanagh 63), the speaker promises: Wejdc i wyjdf z pustymi r?kami. A na dowod, ze bvhini prawdziwie obecna, nie przedstawi? niczego procz slow, ktorym nikt nie da wiary. (34) I'll enter and exit empty-handed. And my proof I was there will be only words, which no one will believe. (Baranczak and Cavanagh 63) The proliferation of negative constructions in this contemplation of what it means to be "present" communicates uneasiness about what constitutes, or proves, such presence. This uneasiness comes in part, perhaps, from an awareness that expe rience is ultimately intangible, even when it concerns the most concrete matters, like stone. In its insistence on the "zmysl udzialu" ("sense of taking part"), the stone speaks against defining experience by what one gets or takes away from it, especially when that experience is an encounter with another. There is, to invoke alternate definitions of "udzial," no part, portion, or share of experience that belongs to the subject. Instead, such experience, and any knowledge or under standing that comes from it, requires participating in, rather than apportioning, the stone's world. This question of "parts" also arises in Graham's "The Age of Reason," when she imagines desire hissing "Tell me / your parts / that I may understand / your body, // your story" (Erosion 19, my italics). The words that desire "hiss[es]" express the desire that drives "Conversation with a Stone." For Graham, the resistance of things to disclosing their "parts" both frustrates our method of knowing and, as an expression of "honesty," also provides the opportunity for a different kind of understanding. In Szymborska, the fact that the speaker will leave "z pustymi rekami" ("empty-handed") does not mean that she will leave with nothing. The stone itself suggests that she is not altogether hopeless when it proclaims: "Nie wejdziesz, masz zaledwie zamysl tego zmyslu, / ledwie jego zawi^zek, wyobraznie" (34; "You shall not enter, you have only a sense of what that sense should be, / only its seed, imagination," Baranczak and Cavanagh 63). And indeed, while her "empty hands" emphasize the inevitable intangibility of the experience, her words, although inadequate as evidence, are nevertheless a product of her having been there. Or rather, of her having not been there, for these hypothetical words emerge as the actual words of the poem itself, a verbal rendition of an imagined conver sation. Thus, as the stone predicts by calling attention to the imagination as the "zawiazek" ("seed") of the sense that is lacking, Szymborska's poem is evidence of the imagination's power to bring the intangible into the material realm as it trans</page><page sequence="15">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 221 forms experience into linguistic matter. In this way, the materialization of the poetic process captures something of the speaker's encounter with the stone's con crete world. While the speaker fails to talk her way into the stone, she does succeed in coaxing it into the conversation that constitutes the poem.9 The poem is thus found—in the sense of a "found object"—the moment the illusion of the door is lost and the stone suddenly appears in all its inaccessible otherness. When it declares "Nie mam drzwi" ("I don't have a door"), it puts an end to the conversation by exposing the door as a device that made getting into the stone seem even a remote possibility. Yet the door does not only represent the trappings of the imagination (the forged connections of metaphor or the inside/ outside dichotomy of anthropomorphism); it also functions as a decoy, a kind of trapdoor that hides the larger anthropomorphism that the poem, even in its critique of anthropocentric paradigms, cannot do without: the stone's speech. As Barbarajohnson writes, "Far from answering 'No,' the stone should not enter into dialogue in the first place ..., by speaking at all it stands up against anthro pomorphism precisely by using it" (Persons and Things 17; cf. Cavanagh 53). That the stone must sustain the poem's anthropomorphism in order to speak against it demonstrates that the desire to preserve and experience the thingness of the stone—the distance that is also the necessary difference between self and other— is more difficult than the poem can say. The poem thus articulates its lesson at the same time as it reveals the difficulty of realizing that lesson fully, for its very premise—a "conversation" with a stone—contradicts the lesson that it purports to teach. Winnicott argues that in order for the subject "to live a life in the world of objects," a world that "can feed back other-than-me substance into the subject," the object must "survive" the subject's "destruction" of it, "must survive instinctual loving, and also hating and . . . pure aggression" (5). Such "destruction" and "aggression" characterize "object-relating" in particularly antagonistic terms and, as such, recall the "assaults" of thoughts that, according to Heidegger, contribute to the "violence that has long been done to the thingly element of things" ("Ori gin" 25). I highlight this language of assault, aggression, destruction, and survival in order to suggest that, while there is no explicit violence in Szymborska's poem, an unmistakable sense of violation develops as the speaker's desire to get inside the stone aligns with a desire for a kind of psychic access to the inner world of that which is other to the self. In her hope of entering the stone, Szymborska's speaker is driven by a desire for the resemblance, relevance, and relatability of metaphor. Treating meaning as transferable and interchangeable in order to make identifications based on similarity, metaphor brings with it the possibility of invasion, violation, and mis appropriation as entities are carried along the tropological chain further and further away from their proper and proprietary place. As Paul de Man describes it, "tropes are not just travelers, they tend to be smugglers and probably smug glers of stolen goods at that" (17). Inspiring her itinerary for touring the stone, 9 Anastasia Graf identifies another level at which the exchange succeeds: "if the voice in 'Conver sation with a Stone' belongs entirely to the speaker, then the realization in the last line that the stone lacks a front door is after all an acquired understanding that supersedes the speaker's earlier naive fantasy of access to the stone's interior" (92).</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 222 and her somewhat disingenuous desire "to enter and exit empty-handed," the figure of the door, as a symptom of the speaker's compulsion for metaphor, sets the stage for a smuggling of sorts. The goods in question may be intangible, but that makes them no less valuable or capable of being stolen. Furthermore, this notion of smuggling returns us to questions involving honesty. The stone's final claim that it has no door challenges not only the speaker's assumption that it has an accessible interior, but also her belief that the stone has the power to open what remains, for the speaker, "shut tight." This resistance to associating agency and moral choice with openness, particularly in the context of objects that seem defiantly closed, recalls Graham's attempt to separate "honesty" from openness and admission.10 If, as Graham suggests, the "honesty of things" resides in their resistance, then perhaps honesty in poetry consists of rendering and preserving that resistance. Like the resistant poem that "forces" Graham to let go of the mind's grasping motion, Szymborska's impenetrable stone enables the speaker to see the only thing that she can get away with: words. These words take nothing tangible from the stone. However, as a materialized, self-contained form of the imagined encoun ter that stands on its own, the poem does take after that stone. As an account of not gaining access, the poem, like the stone, provides shelter for what must remain beyond reach but that can still be preserved and experienced as near. Paradoxi cally, survival on both sides of what began as the stone's door is thus only possible because there isn't one. "Conversation with a Stone" asks what it means to want to know, to understand, or to relate to an other—to want to "get inside someone's head," as we say. Szymborska shows that such guests are not always welcome, that, without invitation, what is intended as a visit can become a violation. Resistant Things, Resistant Words The questions of violation, self, and other that Szymborska raises with the stone's door are not an issue for Francis Ponge. In his prose poem "Introduction au galet" ("Introduction to the Pebble"), originally collected in Proemes (1948), he insists that we take refuge in the resistance of things simply by "transferring" or giving ourselves over to them: "A tout desir d'evasion, opposer la contemplation et ses ressources. Inutile de partir: se transferer aux choses" (Le parti pris 174; To every desire for escape, oppose contemplation and its resources. Useless to leave: transfer yourself to things). Reappearing only in the final section, the title's "galet" serves as a quintessential thing, a kind of touchstone for Ponge's thinking about the relation between poems and objects. Such everyday objects of contemplation obstruct the desire to escape, but in doing so they also enable the imagination. Moreover, by envisioning "l'ouverture de trappes interieures" (opening interior trapdoors), Ponge makes the initial opening, which is also the distance and differ ence between person and thing, inconsequential in comparison to the "voyage 10 "Conversation with a Stone" raises similar questions regarding honesty's place in the rhetorical world, since the speaker's unsolicited promise to leave the stone empty-handed admits to the pos sibility of epistemological "smuggling." However, by engaging the speaker's desire to enter only to declare that it has no door, the stone also exhibits a degree of dishonesty in the encounter. There is a bit of metapoetic deception as well, in that the anthropomorphism that leads the speaker to imag ine a door masks the anthropomorphism to which the poem as a whole must resort in order to make a case against the speaker's disingenuous approach to understanding otherness.</page><page sequence="17">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 223 dans l'epaisseur des choses" (176; voyage in the thickness of things) that these interior doors enable. The "epaisseur" (thickness) to which Ponge refers connotes not only a mate rial thickening, but also the intangible thickening of a plot or mystery: "O res sources infinies de l'epaisseur des choses, rendues par les ressources infinies de l'epaisseur semantique des mots!" (Leparti pris 176; O infinite resources of the thickness of things, rendered by the infinite resources of the semantic thickness of words). The "ressources" of contemplation that Ponge places in opposition to the desire to escape consist of both objects (tangible thickness) and words (a thick ness of meaning, "plot"). For Ponge, recognizing the correspondence between the material thickness of things and "l'epaisseur semantique" (the semantic thickness) of words allows the mind easily to enter what might otherwise be impenetrable. To put it differently, matching "l'epaisseur des choses" (the thick ness of things) with "l'epaisseur semantique des mots" (the semantic thickness of words) turns impeded access into infinite resource, with the difficulty of the former becoming the poetic productivity of the latter. However, the thickness of things and words and the poetic productivity it produces are not without pitfalls, as Ponge's "Un rocher" ("A Rock"), also from Proemes, reveals. Using a stone, as does Szymborska, to express the difficulty of the poetic enterprise, he begins, "De jour en jour la somme de ce queje n'aipas encore dit grossit, fait boule de neige" (Leparti pris 148; From day to day, the sum of what I have not yet said builds, snowballs). By the end of the poem the snowball ing unarticulated thoughts have acquired the concreteness of a boulder, as he exclaims: "Helas! aujourd'hui encore je recule epouvante par l'enormite du rocher qu'il me faudrait deplacer pour deboucher ma porte ..." (149; Alas! today, again, I shrink back, terrified by the enormity of the rock I would have to move in order to unblock my door). Faced with the task of moving the rock—a remnant, perhaps, of "le rocher de Sisyphe" that he mentions in "Pages bis," the second part of Proemes (Leparti pris 184)—into which his unsuccessfully expressed thoughts have amassed, in order to "unblock" the door, Ponge finds himself strug gling to exit rather than access "le monde secret de [s] a contemplation et de [s] on imagination" (148; the secret world of [his] contemplation and imagination). The rock thus materializes what he cannot get out in words and what prevents him from getting out of or beyond himself at all. The obstacle formed by language's failure to bridge the gap between internal and external, self and other is expressed less metaphorically in "Rhetorique" ("Rhetoric"), in which Ponge unsympathetically contemplates the suicides of those who "trouvent que 'les autres' ont trop de part en eux-memes" (Leparti pris 157; find that"others" have too great a part in themselves). He imagines advising them, "donnez tout au moins la parole a la minorite de vous-memes. Soyez poetes" (at least grant the word to the lesser part of yourselves. Be poets), to which one of them would reply, "mais c'est la encore que je sens les autres en moi-meme, lorsque je cherche a m'exprimer je n'y parviens pas. Les paroles sont toutes faites et s'expriment: elles ne m'expriment point" (but it's precisely there that I feel others in me, so that when I try to express myself, I cannot manage to. Words are ready-made and express themselves: they do not express me). Of this predica ment Ponge writes, "C'est alors qu'enseigner l'art de resister aux paroles devient utile" (It's then that teaching the art of resisting words becomes useful). With this art of resisting comes "l'art de fonder sa propre rhetorique" (the art of founding</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 224 [one's] own rhetoric), which, according to Ponge, "sauve" (saves) those "qui peu vent faire avancer 1'esprit, et a proprement parler changer la face des choses" (who can make the mind advance and, strictly speaking, change the face of things). In this way, the resistance that Ponge prescribes is inseparable from his notion of the power of poetic expression as a means not of explaining or knowing things perfectly, but of remaking them. That this remaking involves the human and object world alike is suggested by the phrase "la face des choses" (the face of things), a catachresis that conflates human and inanimate forms. Both Paul de Man (19) and Barbara Johnson (World 53) have referred to catachresis as a "figure of abuse," given its ability to create figurative substitutes for a literal term that doesn't exist, and the question of abuse emerges starkly in "Rhetorique" precisely in connection with a resistance to lan guage that enables people to "change the face of things." To the art of resisting words Ponge adds the more explicitly abusive characterization of "l'art de ne dire que ce que l'on veut dire, l'art de les [paroles] violenter et de les soumettre" (the art of saying only what one wants to say, the art of doing violence to them [words] and forcing them to submit). For him this violent treatment of language provides a solution to (is in essence a substitute for) the suicidal impulses of those who feel the otherness of language inhabiting and overtaking the self. Making Things Real Rather than focusing on the human stakes represented by things, Ponge reveals what things have to offer our attempts at expression. Stated most explic itly in "L'oeillet" ("The Carnation"), what things have to offer, and what people must accept, is their "defi . . . au langage," their "challege" or resistance to lan guage (La rage 51). Such things offer "Evidence muette opposable" (mute oppo sable evidence)—of what, Ponge doesn't say, and this is, perhaps, the point. They are evidence of the desire and need for expression, but also of all that, like the rock in "Un rocher," cannot be expressed, and of the necessary impossibility of expressing all things. It is in this way that things teach the art of resisting words. Locating the value of expression in the constant renewal of its efforts and not its success, Ponge dismisses the goal of "un poeme parfait, qui dit ce qu'il veut dire, ce qu'il a envie de dire, ce qu'il se trouve qu'il dit" {Lepartipris 191; a perfect poem that says what it means, what it wants to say, what it turns out that it says) in favor of language that requires "un peu d'herolsme, de gout de la difficulte, du tour de force" (a bit of heroism, of a taste for the difficult, of a show of prowess). Because language becomes meaningful primarily through his struggle with it, Ponge needs to experience language as difficult and non-compliant rather than perfectly suited or readily adaptable to his expressive endeavors. Speaking of the need to "foncer a travers les paroles, malgre les paroles, les entrainer avec soi, les bousculant, les defigurant" (Le parti pris 190; charge through words, in spite of words, to drag them along with you, shoving them, disfiguring them) or of "l'art de les violenter et les soumettre" (the art of violating them and forcing them to submit), Ponge treats language as independent and rebellious, as something to reign in, subjugate, and violate. It is in this sense a badly behaved object, and the process of using it becomes a form of domination.</page><page sequence="19">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 225 Is self-expression through language, then, another version of the power of sub jects over objects? Winnicott's notion that successful object-use depends on "the behavior of the object" suggests that the dynamic is more complex (88). The "behavior" to which Winnicott here refers is the "object surviving] destruction by the subject" (90), which means that the object "not retaliate" (90) or "suffer change" (93). In this scenario, the object meets the subject's needs (to experience destructiveness and the object's survival of the destruction), and the subject gains "immeasurably" (90). Yet there is another scenario in which the object benefits the subject because it fails to meet the subject's needs. As an example of such a "failure," Winnicott offers the figure of the "good-enough mother" who "starts off with an almost complete adaptation to her infant's needs, and as time proceeds she adapts less and less completely, gradually, according to the infant's growing ability to deal with her failure" (10). Winnicott argues that "the infant can actually come to gain from the experience of frustration, since incomplete adaptation to need makes objects real, that is to say, hated as well as loved" (11); indeed, "exact adaptation resembles magic and the object that behaves perfectly becomes no bet ter than a hallucination" (11). Winicott's comments regarding the ultimate use lessness of the perfectly behaved, always available object (mother, in this case) resemble Ponge's dismissal of the "perfect poem" as the goal of expression. Just as the object's perfect adaptation to need makes it "no better than a hallucination," so a perfectly realized poem, one that conveys the sense of there being nothing more to say and no better way to say it, makes expression a dead-end rather than a recuperative path of return to a world that is real insofar as it, too, is imperfect. However, the perfect and imperfect objects are not without their own element of "magic," and, as embodiments of a theoretical concept, they may be "no better than a hallucination." Unlike the "good-enough mother," these objects require animation and an attribution of agency in order to be thought of as "behaving" at all. Yet this behavior—or, more specifically, the establishment of the inanimate object as an entity capable of behavior—is not the endpoint of the fantasy. Instead, it is the key component of a larger fantasy or a demand that objects "behave" in a particular way, so that any object that seems to resist a person's attempt to know it can be understood as having agency and will and moral choice. To put it differ ently, there is something "real" about things that leave our needs and desires unfulfilled rather than producing the "exact adaptation [that] resembles magic." In closing, I turn to Anne Carson's poem "On Shelter," which confronts the reader with questions of right and wrong as it addresses the demand that not only objects, but also poems, "behave" in a particular way. On Shelter You can write on a wall with a fish heart, it's because of the phosphorus. They eat it. There are shacks like that down along the river. I am writing this to be as wrong as possible to you. Replace the door when you leave, it says. Now you tell me how wrong that is, how long it glows. Tell me.

Insisting on the deliberate "wrongness" of the poem or, more pre cisely, on the deliberateness with which the poem has been made to elicit con demnations of wrongness, Carson invests the poem with a resistance that seems to promise bad behavior. Yet what kind of wrongness is Carson invoking? There is a sense of ethical wrongness in writing with a fish heart that is both a visceral image of poetic material and a perverse literalization of what it means to write from the heart. There is also, Carson suggests, something morally amiss about an act of reading that passesjudgment on such writing. And finally, whether it is the figurative fishiness of the poem's opening, which leads us to wonder whether we could write with a heart and whether the writing would glow, or the poem's lack of logical progression and gaps between sentences, or the inconsistent pro nouns whose obscurity verges on grammatical incorrectness, "On Shelter" resists comprehension in ways that might be attributed to textual wrongness or error. Carson's later poem "Essay on What I Like Most" begins with a one-word line that is presumably the "what" of the title—namely, "Error" (Men 30). Its first stanza ends with a question that the remainder of the poem seeks to answer: "Realizing you've made an error brings shame and remorse. / Or does it?" Carson continues: Lots of people including Aristotle think error an interesting and valuable mental event. [....] Aristotle says that metaphor causes the mind to experience itself in the act of making a mistake. He pictures the mind moving along a plane surface of ordinary language when suddenly that surface breaks or complicates. Unexpectedness emerges. (30) Carson's image of a mind moving along a "surface of ordinary language" that suddenly cracks, causing the mind to stumble, resonates with the equally tangi ble depictions of the mind's effort at understanding that we have encountered in Graham, Szymborska, and Ponge. Like them, Carson plays with the too easily assumed link between comprehension and the materiality of things, except that in this case the failure of that link becomes a source of understanding and even "truth." Describing the "unexpectedness" with which the prior stanza ended, Car son continues: At first it looks odd, contradictory or wrong. Then it makes sense. And at this moment, according to Aristotle, the mind turns to itself and says: "How true, and yet I mistook it!" From the true mistakes of metaphor a lesson can be learned. (31) Drawing on the sense of physical grasping in the word "mistake," Carson has Aristotle say of "such mistakenness," "Hold onto it," and, making it an object of the senses, "there is so much to be seen and felt here" (31). It is not that truth comes from mistakes, but that there are in fact "true mistakes." Just as a compul sion for metaphor, a desire to see likeness, led Szymborska's speaker directly to her error, so the "true mistakes" to which Carson refers are "the true mistakes of</page><page sequence="21">POETRY'S RESISTANT INTERIORS / 227 metaphor." While it is true that metaphor establishes equivalences, the equiva lences themselves are essentially false, its "mistakes" its truth. The error in judg ment that Carson describes ('"How true, and yet I mistook it!'") is not one that involves perceiving as "wrong" something that was in fact "right"; it involves, instead, associating that mistake with a lack of "sense." In other words, the error lies in failing to realize that there is Tightness in being wrong. "You can never know enough, never use the infinitives and participles oddly enough, never impede the movement harshly enough, never leave the mind quickly enough" (Plainwater 29), Carson states at the end of the Introduction to "Short Talks." The questionable facts, syntactical oddities, and disjointedness of thought in "On Shelter" are a demonstration of these principles, which resist the idea that the door could ever be closed on a question, topic, or "task," as the Introduction calls it. Significantly, the most resistant moment of "On Shelter" comes in the sen tence sandwiched between the two statements of wrongdoing: "Replace the door when you leave, it says." There is something not so much wrong as odd about Car son's use of "replace," the kind of mistake that does not preclude understanding since the mind can easily follow a chain of synonyms that leads back to the more familiar command to "close the door." Yet because "replace" also makes intuitive sense we pause to consider that, while we can make it mean "close," it has its own meaning that creates an opening in the text. Indeed, "replace" itself implies a prior opening or even removal of the door and, in so doing, points to the absence of any such action in the poem. While Carson mentions "shacks like that down along the river," she does not depict any entrance into them. However, she does enact a kind of rhetorical opening at the very start of the poem with an apostro phe that pulls the reader directly into the text. In this way, the sheltering space whose door "you" will "Replace [... ] when you leave" is the poem's. As opposed to the apostrophes regarding mistakes in "Essay on What I Like Most," the apparent direct address in the opening lines of "On Shelter" also stands as a narrative account involving a hypothetical "you." In fact, the com mand to "Replace the door when you leave" is also a misleading apostrophe since it is followed by the words "it says." Encompassing both the phosphorous and the fish heart that, having absorbed it, becomes a viable writing implement, the "it" refers, by extension, to the writing on the shack's wall that says to any visitor or intruder: "Replace the door." As one form of the shelter that "On Shel ter" claims as its subject, the shack thus evokes the bare-bones structure of Car son's poem. In other words, "shacks like that" are like poems. Or rather, like shacks, poems are structures that shelter something luminous within. A dark block of text in the middle of a white page, "On Shelter" takes the form of the structure it describes. It is a space that we enter almost unconsciously, recog nizing the "transfer" (to recall Ponge) that has happened only when it comes time to "Replace the door when [we] ... leave." Much as the speaker's naive assumption of a door in "Conversation with a Stone" verges on violation, the sense of poverty, fragility, and vulnerability that Carson's shacks evoke suggests that the door needs replacing because the entry, however unconscious, is nevertheless a destructive intrusion. Yet the admonition to "Replace the door" reveals the possibility for a repair that is not only physical, but also epistemological. Only the reader can restore the poem's ability to convey meaning and truth through the writing, whose</page><page sequence="22">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 228 glow can last only so long in a single reading but that, sheltered within, will glow anew with each return. However, by declaring "Now you tell me how wrong that is, how long it / glows," Carson implies—syntactically, but also through the rhyming of "wrong" with "long"—that the duration of the glow is inseparable from the perceived wrong ness of the poem. Perhaps the judgment that Carson here anticipates concerns the fact that the writing glows on while the life (and death) that generated it fades away. Challenging the reader to put the wrongness of the poem into words— "Tell me," she writes—Carson implies that what will prove "wrong" is the assump tion that there are easily explainable definitions of right and wrong. Passing judg ment thus emerges as the easy way out that "On Shelter" defies us to take. All of the poems I have discussed reveal that resistance is not about finding the easy way out, but rather about taking the difficult way in. As in "On Shelter," they use resistance to raise questions about right and wrong—the Tightness or wrongness of effort, opacity, remoteness, otherness. "On Shelter" speaks to the demand that objects and poems "behave" in a certain way. It suggests how diffi cult poems might get lost in this demand and challenges the reader to see what a loss that would be. Harvard University Works Cited Bishop, Elizabeth.
