<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Maritain Volume of the Thomist. Edited by the Dominican Fathers of St. Joseph. New York: Sheed and Ward. 1943. .. 374 pp. $3.50. The fifth volume of the Thomist, quarterly review of philosophy and theology, is the Maritain Volume, representing some two dozen articles written by Thomists and non-Thomists as a testimonial of their esteem for Jacques Maritain on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday. The articles cover a wide range of topics in the fields of theology, philosophy, and science. The editors of the Thomist and their special committee, Professors William O'Meara, Mortimer Adler, and Yves Simon, are to be congratulated for the success of their undertaking. The scholarship put into the work by so many of its contributors is a tribute to both the work and person of M Maritain. As the editorial preface puts it, "this tribute is a mark of keen interest in the fields of Maritain's labors, the sources of his thought and the fruits of the years of work he has spent in those fields inspired by these sources." Despite the temptation to dwell at some length on each of these studies, space. does not permit more than their mention with a brief and summary treatment of a few. Professor Waldemer Gurian's article, "On Maritain's Political Philosophy," represents</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 581 an examination of Maritain's contribution to the field of political and social philosophy and should be helpful as an introduction to anyone interested in making that aspect of his thought their special study. "The Theological Ingredients of Peace," by J. C. Osbourn, approaches the subject directly from a textual study of St. Thomas's own works. "The Virtue of Social Justice and In- ternational Life," by Frances E. McMahon, is a reexamination of the Thomistic idea of the common good in the light of our contem- porary interest in a universal or world society. President Robert Hutchins in his learned article, "The Theory of Oligarchy: Ed- mund Burke," finds the political ideas of Burke, who desired "to protect the aristocracy from attack from any quarter," in oppo- sition to Maritain's stand on universal suffrage. The study is well documented and gives an interesting and somewhat unusual por- trayal of the English political thinker, who, in Mr. Hutchins' opin- ion, was not a seeker after truth. The essay on "Jacques Mari- tain" by Ruth Nanda Anshen seems to be a juxtaposition of emotionalism and reason.' 1 In fact, the article, to the reviewer, represents neither the man nor the things for which he stands. It makes sense only when it is divided into two parts, the first consisting of the first, second, and last paragraphs and the second all the intervening paragraphs. In the first part Maritain is described as a man " upon whose metaphysical and generous heart lie heavily the burdens and sadness of contemporary existence." In the second part he is said to maintain that it is "our absolute duty to accept reason as the only adequate form of philosophy." The contrast is explained, however, when one realizes that the whole of what has been called the second part is almost verbatim what Professor Gilson wrote in his Harvard Tercentenary address, Mediaeval Universalism and Its Present Value (Sheed and Ward, 1937, pp. 16-20). It is somewhat misleading, to say the least, when we read in Dr. Anshen 's article (p. 80) that "Maritain warns us against the encroachments of the totalitarian state in its various forms, and points out that our only conceivable protection, humanly speaking at least, is in a powerful revival of the genuine feeling for the universal character of truth. I say feeling because it is a natural temptation for everyone to coin a truth of his own, made after his own image and likeness, so that this anthropomorphism may give us at the same time the solipsistic pleasure of self-contemplation . . . ," and then turn to Gilson's work (p. 16) and read "against the encroachments of the totalitarian state in its various forms, our only conceivable protection, humanly speaking at least, is in a powerful revival of the mediaeval feeling for the universal character of truth. I say feeling, because it is a natural temptation for everyone of us to coin a truth of his own, made after his own image and likeness, so that its contemplation may give us at the same time the selfish pleasure of self-contemplation. . . . " This reviewer has seen St. Thomas Aquinas referred to as the author of the Imitation of Christ, but this is the first time he has seen Maritain mistaken for Gilson.</page><page sequence="3">582 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Professor Yves Simon's study on "Maritain's Philosophy of the Sciences" is a concise treatment of a subject in which Maritain has made outstanding contributions, particularly in the field of physico-mathematical knowledge. The article can be profitably employed in the study of Maritain's Philosophy of Nature and his Degrees of Knowledge. However, when the author says (page 87) that "the whole observable world, including the human soul which is the form of a perishable body, belongs to the order of objects which can neither exist nor be thought of apart from matter" the statement must be taken, in the opinion of the reviewer, with some qualification. First, if the human soul, which according to St. Thomas and Maritain is a single substantial form, is included among the observables, then the field of observation must be ex- tended to include a subject of acts which are not in the genus of corporeal activities, and secondly, restricting the observables to the material order of existence, we have still to account for the immateriality of the object of intellectual knowledge. According to St. Thomas scientific thought of any object requires abstraction from matter and in this he expresses his agreement with Aristotle in the latter's criticism of the pre-Socratic materialists. There is a distinction between the common matter, the theoretic antecedent substrate of change in the physical world, apart from which there is no thought of the observable, and the individual and perishable material, observable only in sense experience and apart from which even the thought of matter itself takes place. This is exemplified still further in the case of mathematical knowledge where the ob- ject is thought of entirely apart from the physical qualities which describe the material of the physical world. The question of a subject existing apart from matter has its evidence in the psy- chological experience of consciousness but as something open to rational demonstration it is reserved for metaphysics and particu- larly that branch of the subject we call natural theology. In this connection the article, "The Demonstration of God's Existence," by Professor Adler is both interesting and provocative. The pro- bative force of the five ways of demonstrating God's existence is questioned. The arguments, according to Adler, rest on the im- possibility of an infinite series of causes. Such a possibility, how- ever, says the author, must be conceded because "the proposition that the world is eternal is neither self-evidently nor demonstra- tively false." Hence, in the first part of the Summa Theologica where St. Thomas offers such proofs, he is speaking as a "poleme- cist" and a "theologian." First, it seems to the reviewer that Professor Adler will accept only the type of demonstration which St. Thomas calls a "demonstratio propter quid," i.e., a demonstra-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 583 tion in which God's existence could be inferred in the same way in which the properties of a triangle can be derived from its essence. St. Thomas himself objected to the traditional ontolog- ical argument on these grounds and contended that the nature of human reason and its object are such that a proof of this kind is impossible. On the other hand, St. Thomas did not seem to think that a "demonstratio quia" was no rational proof at all. Further he was perfectly aware that the infinite regress when applied to movers was far from being unintelligible. This was shown clearly in the dilemma in which Aristotle found himself when he came to calculate the number of unmoved movers in his Physics. From a closer examination of St. Thomas's texts it would seem that he is more concerned to establish the existence of the First Cause of a being or beings which are in objective potency to existence prior to their being in subjective potency to this or that particular kind of motion. The analogy with physical movements is given, but it is not at all the substance of the proof. The concept of potency is much more extensive than that possessed by an object capable of being moved in space. Nor would the infinite regress criticism apply here, where there are no intermediary causes such as there are in a neo-platonic world view. Professor Adler, however, has done a real service in forcing the Thomists to come out and re- state their whole position on the matter. Father G. B. Phelan 's study on "Justice and Friendship" com- mands attention as an outstanding piece of scholarly research. The role of justice in friendship in Plato and Aristotle, together with the additional consideration of charity by St. Thomas, gives a magnificently contrasting view of the pure naturalism of the Greeks on the one hand and the theocentric humanism of the Chris- tian philosopher on the other. Professor W. R. Thomson in his article on "Providence" defends the Christian concept of teleol- ogy in the light of contemporary science. He is to be congratu- lated for having exposed the superficial arguments of the fideists and also for observing the limits which rational inquiry must observe in dealing with the question. There is a distinction to be drawn between providential action and the principle of order and intelligibility in nature. "Providential action," he thinks, "falls outside the field of science." Father Gerald Smith's contribution, "A Date in the History of Epistemology," should be especially interesting to students of contemporary scholastic philosophy. The question of whether or not we know existents is resolved in terms of certain fundamental presuppositions laid down by Gilson in his Realisme Thomiste et Critique de la Connaissance and Le Realisme MIethodique. Their importance is seen by the author of the article</page><page sequence="5">584 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY in the fact that they constitute a date, ante Gilson and post Gilson, in the history of epistemology. "Matter, Beatitude and Liberty" by Professor A. C. Pegis is a further study and application of Gilson's Gifford lecture thesis. The concepts of Plato and Aristotle are examined in the light of philosophical insights resulting from the knowledge of the Judmo- Christian revelation. Professor William O 'Meara's study of "John Dewey and Modern Thomism" is presented somewhat as a challenge to contemporary Thomists, among whom Dewey's views have not been very favorably received. Professor O'Meara sug- gests a more objective study of the philosopher's writings and his impression seems to be that the Thomist will find much to agree with in Dewey's analysis of experience if he will but expend the effort and time to see what Dewey is criticizing in past systems and the reasons for the constructive ideas he offers in their place. The " Thomistic Concept of Culture," by Robert E. Brennan, 0. P., is a somewhat lengthy article in which the subject is surveyed from the writings of St. Thomas and a few commentaries. Save for a footnote at the beginning in which the author recognizes Maritain as having written on the subject and having drawn his inspiration from St. Thomas there is no mention of the vast con- tribution which Maritain has made to the development of the Thomistic concept of culture in modern times. Professor Chap- man's "To Be-That is the Answer" emphasizes the existential aspect of Thomism. Some may find the article too rhetorical for serious philosophical interest, but it succeeds in calling attention to a side of Thomism that is often neglected. In "The Role of Dogma in Judaeism" Dr. Fincklestein shows that despite the con- tention that "Judaoism has no dogmas" there is ample historical evidence to the contrary, especially in the writings of Moses Mai- monides and other medievalists. Father L. B. Bondy's study of " Claudel and the Catholic Revival" brings out in an objective light the various influences at work in the conversion of the French poet and the tendency towards mysticism exhibited in his works. Daniel Sargeant's "Dante and Thomism" indicates the folly of trying to interpret the significance of a poet in terms of a phi- losophy. Despite the great admiration he had for St. Thomas "Dante was not celebrating in his poem any system of philosophy as was Lucretius in his De Rerum Natura." Mr. Sargeant refers to Gilson's claim that Dante was not a Thomist, but does not con- sider the question of the Averr6ist influences, which, of course, is the crucial issue with Gilson. "A Motet: De Ordinatione An- gelorum" by Arthur Lourie and a bibliography of Jacques Mari- tain, 1910-1942, by Ruth Burns, complete the volume.
