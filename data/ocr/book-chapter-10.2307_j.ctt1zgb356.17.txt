<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 13 Archaeology of rock art at  Dalakngalarr 1, central-western  Arnhem Land Daniel James, Bruno David, Jean-Jacques Delannoy, Robert Gunn,  Alexandria Hunt, Ian Moffat, Nadia Iacono, Sean Paul Stephens  and Margaret Katherine Introduction In 2011, we began researching the subsurface archaeology, geomorphology and rock art of  Dalakngalarr 1, a moderately sized rockshelter on top of the central-western Arnhem Land  plateau in Jawoyn Country. Here, four lines of evidence give relative or absolute ages for rock art: 1. Archaeological excavations adjacent to a boulder that contains a painting of a red macropod  reveal when that boulder attained its present position, so the red macropod must have been  painted sometime afterwards.  2. Paintings of axe/hoes with metal heads indicate that they were painted during the European- contact period. A nearby group of X-ray images are painted in comparable pigments,  suggesting that they are contemporaneous with the axe/hoes. 3. Geomorphological evidence suggests that parts of the site’s ceiling collapsed at datable times  in the past, indicating that the art on that roof must post-date the roof collapse. 4. Direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates on beeswax art. Archaeological context Dalakngalarr 1 is an enclosed shelter, located deep in Jawoyn Country on the central-western  Arnhem Land plateau, some 190 km southeast of Darwin (Figures 13.1 and 13.2; see also  Figure 1.1). It was rediscovered in 2007 as part of the Jawoyn Rock Art and Heritage Project  (Gunn and Whear 2007). Dalakngalarr 1 is part of a large, low-lying outcrop of Kombolgie  sandstone that dips down towards the southeast.  </page> <page sequence="2"> 330    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 13.1 Dalakngalarr site complex, looking southeast.

The rock outcrops in the vicinity of Dalakngalarr 1 contain three adjacent complexes of  archaeological sites: Dalakngalarr (allocated the code ARN-082 in the Jawoyn site database),  LBX (ARN-083) and Dalakjarang (ARN-102). These three site complexes are separated by  seasonal streams that flow along eroded joint lines in the bedrock. Each site complex is located in  a distinct geomorphological setting and contains a locally major art and occupation site. The three site complexes each contain distinctive archaeological sites (Tables 13.1 and 13.2).  The landscape of Dalakjarang is of a long, low rock ridge within which are found a number of  small shelters. The Dalakjarang site complex fronts a flat sand plain with a large expanse of flat  rock to the southeast above and behind the rockshelters. This site complex contains a large linear  stone arrangement, an unusually high number of standing stones (cf. Gunn et al. 2012) and  a large and hitherto unique painted motif in its major shelter. Two sets of grinding patches occur  on bedrock surfaces between the major site and the nearby creek. The large stone arrangement  was interpreted by Margaret Katherine as a ceremonial site that was probably related to the  regional Dalak (sand goanna, Varanus panoptes) Dreaming. This stone arrangement lies directly  in front of the major art shelter that, in addition to housing the unusual motif mentioned above,  also contains almost two-thirds of all the art within the site complex. Another unusual aspect  of the rock art here is the high number of sites (10 of 23 art shelters) with ‘Dynamic Figures’  (cf. Chaloupka 1993:106–119). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="3"> 13.

As with Dalakjarang, most of the artwork in this site  complex is concentrated within one shelter (Dalakngalarr 1), but here, and throughout the site  complex, the emphasis is on paintings of fauna with a much greater use of white pigment.  A large number of ‘older’ red and yellow paintings occur within this site complex, but no classic  Dynamic Figures have been located. Also, while another stone arrangement occurs here, it is  much smaller and within a more confined space than that at Dalakjarang. At site complex LBX, a small cluster of residual stacks stand in front of a solid outcrop of bedrock  cut by a grid of narrow, joint-derived corridors (cf. Young et al. 2009:172). Here, most rockshelters  occur at the corners of intersecting corridors. The artwork is focused on the larger ARN-083/1  shelter; however, it has only around one-third of the artworks in the complex, so the concentration  at this one site is notably less than in the dominant site at the other two site complexes. At LBX,  the art is predominantly older red and yellow art, with an emphasis on smaller paintings of fauna.  No archaeological traces other than art shelters have been recorded here. Neither archaeological excavations nor detailed art recording have yet been undertaken within  either the Dalakjarang or LBX site complexes. Table 13.1 Contents of site complexes.

Dalakngalarr 1 During initial examination by Robert Gunn and Leigh Douglas in September 2007, Dalakngalarr  1 was seen to contain a high number of paintings for such an enclosed shelter, estimated at &gt;400  visible images (Table 13.2). These images were thought to cover a broad span of time, with slim  anthropomorphs holding boomerangs (cf. Lewis 1988) being of considerable age evident on  the eastern and western outer walls, and demonstrably more recent art of the European-contact  period in the form of two paintings of metal axe/hoes on the rear interior wall of the shelter.  The more recent X-ray art appeared to have been painted in a strikingly similar style, and with  similar pigments, to that at Nawarla Gabarnmang some 17 km to the west-southwest. This initial  impression of similarity in style and composition of the fish paintings at the two sites prompts  questions about connections between them, a topic of investigation currently being addressed  by James (in prep.) and Gunn (Chapter 12). Dalakngalarr 1 was chosen for study because of its  abundant rock art, and because its overhang houses the largest rockshelter of the site complex. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="5"> 13.

Of particular interest is ceiling Panel A5 with pictures of yellow anthropomorphs  holding boomerangs (Figure 13.3). Sub-surface archaeological investigations in this eastern part  would be problematic as there is considerable evidence of wet-season water flow over and into  the soft sandy soil. The rock surface is also stained black by water flow. This black staining has  affected much of the eastern outer wall’s rock surface (see Figure 13.4, right-hand side of back  wall); it is particularly prevalent in the area around Panel A5, limiting our ability in this part to  understand the age of the art. On the opposite side of the site there are no excavatable deposits  beneath the western wall’s stepped rocky platform. Figure 13.4 Evidence of water flow at ground level and along the eastern wall adjacent to Panel A5. Source: Photograph by Chris Urwin. Aiming to contextualise the rock art, our choice of where to excavate took into account site  formation processes in the broader environment. The present shelter cavity was formed by the  collapse of layers of rock near the northern margin of the site. Today, the shelter has a wide,  northwesterly to northeasterly aspect (Figure 13.5). The eastern rock face delimiting the edge  of the shelter has undergone wall and ceiling collapse, with individual collapsed layers of rock  now creating a sloping, rocky floor angled c. 30° to horizontal (Figures 13.2 and 13.6). Here  paintings on the outer rock face are found up to c. 1.0–1.5 m above ground; they also occur on  the ceiling above the sloping rock floor. In contrast, the paintings on the western, outer wall are  raised up to c. 4 m above ground, considerably higher than on the eastern outer wall, with roof  and wall collapse forming a rocky shelf that fronts the western outer wall (Figures 13.7 and 13.8).  Overhanging layers of rock form a mini-ceiling over some of the western wall, offering some  protection from the elements, but overall it is quite exposed. Numerous paintings are found on  the western rock face and on this secondary ceiling.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="7"> 13.

Many parts of the shelter where finer-grained quartzite is exposed  have been heavily quarried for stone tools. There is also evidence of flaking activity on fallen  boulders and rock slabs. Many of the rock collapses on the shelter floor have resulted in the  creation of surfaces suitable for walking or sitting, and many of these have been worn smooth  (Figure 13.8).

Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    337  In the early dry season months from May to July, the shelter enjoys the following daily rhythm:  the easternmost wall is exposed to direct sunlight throughout the morning hours, peaking towards  the middle of the day. From around midday onwards, the western wall becomes increasingly  exposed to sunlight until c. 5–6 pm when direct light reaches the entire wall. The western wall is  more protected from the elements, particularly wind and rain coming from the east to southeast.  The shelter interior is generally well protected from conditions affecting both the eastern and  western outer walls. As a result, the floor under the overhang is well preserved; it contains rich  cultural deposits that have been darkened by fires lit by people (Figure 13.9).  Figure 13.9 Shelter interior, looking south. Source: Photograph by Daniel James. The interior of the shelter is dominated by X-ray paintings in various reds and yellows, with  a number of fish taxa (including saratoga, barramundi and eel-tailed catfish) and macropods  represented (see Figure 13.10). Paintings are also found on some boulders under the overhang,  but never as X-ray depictions. Stone artefacts are abundant on the ground just outside the shelter,  as is a large volume of collapsed rock ceiling debris in part caused by quarrying of the wall. Some  of the rock debris has been moved from its original position by people in times past (cf. Delannoy  et al. 2013).  Figure 13.10 The X-ray paintings that dominate the back wall.

Due to their strong  association with anthropogenic fires, magnetic signals have the potential to be used as a proxy  for mapping the spatial and temporal distribution of human occupation (e.g. Herries and Fisher  2010) through both field (Dalan 2007) and laboratory (Dalan and Banerjee 1998)  studies.  These  techniques, particularly the analysis of the magnetic properties of sediments from  excavations, have often been applied to rockshelter investigations, including occasionally in  Australia (Lowe 2014; Marwick 2005). Far less common is the use of field magnetometry as  a  tool to investigate patterns of occupation in caves and rockshelters, although such methods  have significant potential to map the spatial patterning of occupation within a site. In order to investigate such spatial patterning at Dalakngalarr 1, we have measured the  magnetisation of sediments across much of the rockshelter floor using a Geometrics G-856 proton  precession magnetometer. The survey was undertaken using measuring tapes for positioning and  employed a 1 m line and 0.5 m station spacing. Data were corrected for drift with reference to  a base station, de-spiked and processed using Magpick software before being overlain on the site  plan, with magnetic intensity values plotted in nanoteslas (nT) showing magnetic highs in black  and magnetic lows in white with a contour interval of 20 nT (Figure 13.11).

Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    339  The results show that the area immediately beneath the dripline is associated with increased  magnetism in all areas where this coincides with reasonably soft sediments rather than roof  fall. There are areas of decreased magnetism immediately to the north, west and southeast of  the dripline. The enhanced magnetism suggests that the area coincident with the dripline is  either a locus of human occupation or, more likely, has the optimum combination of a suitable  weathering regime, supply of organic materials and burning for magnetic enhancement.  The magnetic lows may represent the background magnetic value of non-magnetic sediments  sourced from the Marlgowa Sandstone (Ferenczi and Sweet 2004) of the Kombolgie Subgroup  (Lane et al. 2007) that hosts the site. Results from inside the shelter have a far more restricted range of magnetic values. Two clear  trends are nevertheless apparent: areas of the shelter floor that have 1) blocks of roof fall; or  2) soft  sediments adjacent to the back (south) of the shelter have lower levels of magnetic  enhancement than sediments elsewhere in the site. This indicates both the inability of occupation  to enhance bedrock magnetism and the probable lower intensity of occupation at the back of the  shelter where the roof is closer to the ground. The extensive amount of roof fall at Dalakngalarr 1  precludes a more rigorous analysis of the spatial distribution of the magnetic signal within the  major occupation area. Further magnetic analyses at Dalakngalarr 1 are in progress, including magnetic susceptibility  measurements, anhyseretic remanent magnetisation, saturation isothermal remanent  magnetisation, hysteresis loops and high and low magnetic temperature magnetic measurements  of the sediments from excavations. The results of these investigations will define the source of  magnetism in the rockshelter sediments and enable us to explore its changes over time.  The excavations These observations prompted archaeological excavations in what appeared from surface clues to  be the thickest soft deposits of the shelter’s interior (Figures 13.2, 13.12 and 13.13). Permission  to excavate was provided by Traditional Owner and Buyhmi clan Elder Margaret Katherine,  both directly and formally through the Jawoyn Association. Due to the relatively small exposed  space between boulders inside the shelter, it was decided that two separate 50 × 50 cm excavation  squares (Squares A and B) would be opened, to help give an archaeological context to the rock  art, in particular that of the European-contact period (see below), the X-ray art (Figure 13.10),  the macropod painting on a boulder on the floor (Figure 13.14) and the paintings on the main  ceiling (e.g. Figures 13.15).  Square A was positioned toward the middle of the shelter, c. 3.5 m inside the northern entrance  (Figure 13.2). It was placed against a boulder collapsed from the ceiling, the northern, exposed  face of which was subsequently painted with a red-infill macropod (Figures 13.13 and 13.14).  Above the painted boulder the ceiling’s surface is staggered rather than smooth, marked by  negative scars of past collapses (Figure 13.16). In this part of the site, the dark sandy ground  is littered with charcoal and leaf litter, indicating a likely area of inhabited space. We hoped to  date the rock collapse event that brought down the boulder, now partly buried, on which the red  macropod was then painted.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="12"> 340    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 13.12 View from western side inside the shelter, looking eastward across Square A.

Square B might also contain  buried exfoliated or otherwise detached pieces of painted rock, by stratigraphic association giving  ages for the deposition of the decorated rocks, and thereby minimum ages for the art, as the  ceiling and rear wall in this part of the shelter are heavily painted (Figure 13.19).

The mean thickness of XUs was 2.9 cm for Square A and 1.3 cm for Square B. Unsieved sediment  samples weighing 50–100 g were taken from each XU, the remaining excavated sediments being  dry-sieved in 2 mm mesh over a tarpaulin some 40 m away. The sieved material was double- bagged on-site, packaged and shipped to Monash University for sorting and analysis.  The position of artefacts ≥2 cm long observed during excavation was recorded in three-dimensions  (3-D); these artefacts were then individually bagged. A small number of charcoal pieces were also  selectively sampled for 3-D recording and individual bagging from each XU. Some of these  charcoal samples were then submitted for AMS radiocarbon dating. Field photographs were  taken at the base of each XU, and photographs and section drawings were made of wall profiles  at the completion of excavation. The bulk-bagged excavated materials retained in the sieves were  subsequently wet-sieved at Monash University, again using a 2 mm mesh sieve. The material  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="15"> 13.  Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    343  was then air-dried for 3–5 days, rebagged and stored under controlled laboratory conditions  (Figure 13.20). All excavated materials were minimally handled during excavation, sieving and  laboratory sorting and analysis. Figure 13.20 Sorting in progress, excavated materials from Square B XU1. Source: Photograph by Bruno David. Square A results Square A was excavated to a maximum depth of 20 cm, within which three major stratigraphic  units (SUs) were identified (Tables 13.3 and 13.4; Figure 13.21). The topmost SU1 (excavated  as XU1) consists of loose surface sediments containing charcoal and stone artefacts. Live and  deceased insects are frequent in this layer, with antlions (Myrmeleontidae) being the most notable.  Antlion nymphs live in soft sandy soil, making small and shallow cone-shaped pits into which  ants and other soil arthropods fall and get eaten. The pits created by the nymphs have a depth  of c. 2 cm, causing limited impacts on the site’s stratigraphy (Valerie Caron, pers. comm. to  Daniel James 2013). The bulk of cultural materials came from SU2 (excavated mainly as XU2– XU4), including three heavily rusted conjoining nail-like metal pieces recovered from the top  of SU2 (Table 13.5). Limited debris from ceiling rock collapse was evident from XU2 (in SU2)  downwards, but in SU3 large rocks from ceiling collapse appear in earnest. This culminated in  XU7 at the base of SU3, a very rocky level spanning the entire width of the square and thus left in  situ. At the base of XU7, only a narrow fissure some 7 cm wide remained exposed between what  appears to be a split rock slab. That narrow fissure was filled with soft sandy sediments including  charcoal. Exposed rock near the base of SU3 predominantly lies flat (Figures 13.21 and 13.22).  The rock fissure signalled that further soft sediments occur below the large rocks at the base of  the excavation: bedrock had not been reached. The base of the large boulder with the red-painted  macropod that marked the southern edge of Square A was encountered in XU6 within mid-levels  of SU3. There was no sediment between the bottom of that boulder and the top of the flat rock  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="16"> 344    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia surface on which it lay. The boulder with the macropod painting thus fell into place sometime  after XU7 had been fully laid down, and after XU6 sediments had begun to deposit (see below  for dating). The red macropod was painted sometime after that. Table 13.3 Details of Excavation Units, Dalakngalarr 1, Square A.

No stone artefacts were recovered from the  base of the narrow fissure between rocks in XU7, but this could be a function of the very limited  surface area covered by the fissure (Table 13.5).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="17"> 13.

From XU8 downwards,  disintegrating sandstone pebbles of SU2 became increasingly frequent across the square. The area  of disintegrating sandstone became more expansive with depth, until it gave way to bedrock  across the entire square in XU16. SU2 is culturally sterile (Figures 13.23 and 13.24).

The stratigraphic sequence is broadly consistent across both excavation squares, with the sum of  Square B’s SU1A and SU1B appearing to be spatially continuous, and contemporaneous, with  SU1 and SU2 in Square A, as indicated by their relative stratigraphic positions and radiocarbon  determinations (see below).  Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from the excavations A total of twelve radiocarbon dates were obtained from Squares A and B (Table 13.9). All are  AMS dates on single pieces of individually 3-D plotted wood charcoal, barring the sample from  XU7 in Square A that was obtained from the sieve. The following discussion of calibrated ages is  based on 68.3 per cent probability distributions.  The initial phase of occupation in Square A dates to sometime within the period 4969–5211  cal BP (in XU7), until 2882–2955 cal BP (in XU5). This period (Phase 1) is represented by  XU7–XU5 in SU3. The dates do not permit us to determine whether occupation was continuous  or intermittent (at archaeological time scales) during Phase 1. It is during this initial phase that  the large boulder marking the southern side of Square A fell into position, and sometime after  that the red macropod was painted on it. This part of the site then remained either unoccupied or  subject to low-intensity occupation until sometime within the calibrated age range 0–290 cal BP  (Phase 2). This second phase began either slightly before or during the European-contact period,  as indicated by three separate radiocarbon dates each calibrating within that age range and by the  presence of three conjoining pieces of metal.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="21"> 13.  Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    349  Initial occupation of the area of Square B dates from 1181–1264 cal BP to 1186–1281 cal BP,  apparently an archaeologically instantaneous event. This was followed about a thousand years  later by a more recent phase of occupation beginning 11–271 cal BP either shortly before, or  during, the European-contact period, as indicated by the presence of a glass bead. This latter,  recent phase is contemporaneous with the most recent Phase 2 of Square A.  Two broad depositional phases are thus evident from the excavated deposits:  • Phase 1, beginning 4969–5211 cal BP (Square A) and extending to 1186–1281 cal BP  (Square  B). The small size of the excavations does not permit us to determine whether  this phase represents relatively continuous occupation, or a series of occupational pulses  (as measured at archaeological time scales). • Phase 2, beginning 0–290 cal BP (Square A), that is, either during or extending into the  European-contact period, as shown by the presence of metal (Square A) and a glass bead  (Square B).

Source: Authors’ data. Ochre from the excavations Square A XU5 and XU6 revealed two pieces of ‘ochre’ (Table 13.10; Figure 13.25). Both pieces  date to sometime between 4969–5211 cal BP (XU7) and 2882–2955 cal BP (XU5). The small  piece of red ochre from XU5 shows evidence of use-wear in the form of two adjacent c. 2 mm  wide longitudinal grooves that extend to the fragment’s pointed end. This type of groove is not  typically associated with grinding, scoring or rubbing an ochre piece against a surface (Hodgskiss  2010:3347–3356), but may indicate an alternative practice: shaving a piece of ochre with a sharp- edged tool (Hodgskiss 2010; Rifkin 2012). We know of no ethnographic records of ochre shaving  from Arnhem Land. This ochre piece is mainly composed of haematite (Fe2O3), causing the red  colour. Infrared spectroscopy identified also the presence of kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). Raman  spectroscopy indicated the presence of minor traces of quartz (SiO2) and anatase (TiO2). The piece of yellow ‘ochre’ from XU6 does  not show obvious evidence of use-wear, but  its soft, powdery surface is not amenable to  the preservation of such evidence. This ochre  has a much lower percentage of iron than  the red ochre, with a relative composition  by weight of 28 per cent iron, compared to  84 per cent for the red piece from XU5. The  yellow ochre is largely composed of clay, with  infrared spectroscopy indicating probable  kaolinite. Raman spectroscopy shows peaks  typical of iron oxides; however, the particular  type of iron oxide could not be identified. The  relatively low composition of iron leads to its  yellow colour. There is no evidence of goethite  or limonite, typical of many yellow ochres.  The  black covering on this piece showed  evidence of the presence of charcoal and  quartz, both major components of the deposit. Figure 13.25 Top: Broken piece of red ochre  from Square A XU5.

Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    351  The closest visible art to Square A where the ochre fragments were recovered is the red macropod  located on the boulder at the edge of the excavation (Figures 13.14, 13.22 and 13.26). The XU5  red ochre fragment dates to shortly after the large boulder with the painted macropod fell into  position at the edge of Square A; the ochre fragment could have been used for the painting of the  macropod. If this was the case, the macropod painting would date closer to 2882–2955 cal BP  than to 4969–5211 cal BP, given the ochre piece’s chrono-stratigraphic position in XU5.

Stone artefacts from the excavations A total of 1288 stone artefacts – 782 from Square A and 506 from Square B – were recovered  from the excavations (Tables 13.5 and 13.8). Other than charcoal, stone artefacts represent  by far the most common type of cultural material in the excavations. The stone artefacts were  predominantly made on a range of different types of quartzite in both squares and in both phases,  followed in quantity by chert, volcanics, siltstone, possibly silcrete and quartz. It is likely that most  quartzite artefacts were made on local raw materials, given the natural availability of quartzite in  the walls and boulders of Dalakngalarr 1. Local quarrying and production would account for the  paucity of cores and presence of cortical flakes in both excavation squares (Stephens 2013). This  is consistent with rock walls at Dalakngalarr 1 having been extensively flaked (e.g. Figure 13.27).  The few chert artefacts would have been brought in, as chert does not outcrop near the site. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="24"> 352    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 13.27 Evidence of quarrying at Dalakngalarr 1. Scale 10cm. Source: Photograph by Daniel James. In both Squares A and B, stone artefact densities peak in Phase 2. In Square A, there are on  average 1.8 artefacts/litre of sediment in Phase 1, followed by 42.5 artefacts/litre of sediment in  Phase 2, indicating that the early European-contact period of Phase 2 has an artefact density 23.6  times that of Phase 1. Similarly, in Square B there are on average 5.3 artefacts/litre of sediment in  Phase 1, followed by 17.7 artefacts/litre of sediment in Phase 2, indicating that during Phase 2  artefact densities were 3.3 times those of Phase 1. These trends represent a consistent increase in  intensities of site use as represented by the deposition of stone artefacts. They are consistent with  an early European-contact phase of artistic activity across the site. Bone, paperbark and standing stones No bone was recovered from either Squares A or B, probably reflecting the acidic nature of  deposits. On the central-western Arnhem Land plateau, bone destruction in acidic deposits  primarily affects material older than c. 400 years old, as determined by excavations at Nawarla  Gabarnmang (personal observations; cf. Allen and Barton 1989:30; Jones and Johnson  1985:222). The complete and surprising absence of faunal remains from Phase 2 in particular at  Dalakngalarr 1 is unlikely to be related to preservation. Did site use not involve the consumption  of notable amounts of animal foods during the European-contact period? Or is it simply that the  two small excavation squares were positioned in areas not used either for cooking or food discard? A limited quantity of surface bone, and of paperbark, was observed in other parts of the shelter  (Figure 13.28). These remains are in the enclosed and protected southwestern corner of the  shelter interior, which also contains a number of small standing stones piled below the opening  of a small, narrow cleft that runs between the western outer wall and the shelter’s interior (Figures  13.29 and 13.30). Standing stones are known to have been used as burial markers outside clefts  in other parts of Jawoyn Country and elsewhere in Arnhem Land (Gunn et al. 2012; see also  James in prep.). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="25"> 13.

Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    355  Glass bead from the excavations A single glass bead was recovered from Square B XU2 (Figure 13.31C). The bead is blue-green in  colour, with an opaque character. It is wider than it is long (width = 2.95 mm), its shape a simple,  annular form. The central hole is noticeably misshapen on one side, a common trait of wound,  annular beads.  A small cavity on the outer bead surface, and the elongated shape and perpendicular position  of this cavity relative to the central bead perforation shows this is a ‘wound’ bead (Harris 1987;  Sprague 1985). As the name suggests, these are made by winding molten glass around a metal  mandrel to the required size and shape, a costly and labour-intensive method of production. The  style of wound bead found at Dalakngalarr 1 is called a ‘seed-bead’, a general term used to describe  small beads of various manufacturing techniques. Beads manufactured this way were typical of  Venetian glass bead-making practices, when Venice/Murano dominated the glass bead market by  the 18th century. By then, Venetians had established workshops in Holland, France, Moravia and  Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) (e.g. Dubin 2006:107; Francis 1991). Similar wound glass  beads were also produced in Germany, India and China, and traded within complex networks  of exchange over very long distances (cf. Dubin 2006; Francis 1991, 1994; Sprague 1985). There are few references to the decorative uses of seed beads in Australian archaeology, although  there are many instances of glass beads from archaeological sites (e.g. Wesley and Litster 2015).  Beads are typically identified as items or currencies of trade. In the most recent discussion of  beads in Arnhem Land, Wesley and Litster (2015) examined seed beads in the photographic  records of early anthropologists visiting Arnhem Land, and as components of choker necklaces  and headbands, a decorative function in body adornment. The Dalakngalarr 1 bead is only the second to be recovered during excavations in Jawoyn  Country. At Nawarla Gabarnmang, a blue glass bead was found in XU1 of excavation Square J  (Bruno David, unpublished data), within sediments dating to the early European-contact period.  Glass beads have great potential as markers of cross-cultural contact and Indigenous trade,  exchange and mobility in northern Australia. Wesley and Litster (2015) propose that beads were  introduced into northern Australia as early as the 18th century by Macassan trepangers. Several  bead assemblages from Indigenous sites in the Wellington Range appear to pre-date the first  Christian missions established in the region in 1916.  As the Dalakngalarr 1 bead is associated with the latter part of Phase 2 occupation, it likely  represents an exchange with members of European exploration parties, missionaries or buffalo  shooters probably further to the north, or through interactions after 1880 with non-Indigenous  peoples who established early mining and/or pastoral industries further west of Jawoyn lands  (Daryl Wesley, pers. comm. to Daniel James 2014). Jawoyn Country is more than 120 km inland  and divided from the coast by a number of territorial-language groups, so the likelihood of an  early date and a Macassan source is reduced. A European contact–period age for the bead would  be consistent with the iron (nail) pieces recovered from Square A at Dalakngalarr 1, the nearby  cut log and the painted metal axe/hoe motifs (see below). Paintings of axe/hoes with metal heads and the X-ray art Two paintings of axe/hoes with metal heads occur at Dalakngalarr 1 (Figure 13.33), so they must  be of the European-contact period. They are done in a style and pigment also otherwise used only  for X-ray paintings at the site, always on the rear wall and rear ceiling (e.g. Figure 13.10). Two  colours are prominent on both axe/hoes: very pale orange (Munsell 10YR 8/2) was used on the  axe painting as infill on the haft and some infill on the blade, and on the hoe painting as solid  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="28"> 356    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia colour throughout; and a distinct iridescent moderate red (Munsell 5R 5/4) was used on the axe  painting as linear internal decoration and outlining. Both colours are only found on paintings  within the shelter interior rather than on outer rock walls, and they feature prominently on all  the X-ray paintings, regardless of subject matter. It seems that the axe/hoe and X-ray paintings  were painted with the same materials and surely at much the same time. The iridescent moderate  red paint was not used for any other paintings.

The choice of colour in X-ray art, and in X-ray fish in particular, is important in western Arnhem  Land: Taçon (1989a:245–246) recorded ethnographic information across Arnhem Land that  emphasised the importance of colour choice and decorative elements as boundaries between life  and death, with solid colour paintings depicting fauna that were dead or cooked, with ‘the colour  roasted out of them’. Internal decorative elements, such as cross-hatching or other linear designs,  were ‘said to represent the being’s flesh and colour and were what gave you “feeling” of Dreamtime  essence’ (Taçon 1989a:245; see also Taçon 1989b). Colour, particularly vibrant or shimmering  colours on fish, may be associated with Bolung (Jawoyn: Rainbow Serpent, a powerful Dreaming  being who is both a life-giver and destroyer), as well as qualities of reflection and shimmering, such  as found in water and scales (Taçon 1989b). For the Yolngu of northeastern Arnhem Land, red  ochre colours are often symbolically linked to blood and ritual power (e.g. Morphy 1992:196).  Infrared spectroscopy of the moderate red pigments on the X-ray paintings at Dalakngalarr 1 has  revealed a fairly consistent combination of haematite and kaolinite, indicating a recurring blend  of red and white pigments. Various signs point to a late 19th-century or early 20th-century age  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="29"> 13.  Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    357  for the moderate red: its occurrence only in the X-ray and the axe/hoe paintings, that all these  paintings occur in one part of the site, that they all make the uppermost and most recent layers  in superimposition; and that they all have a very ‘fresh’ appearance. A major implication of the above observations is that the X-ray art at Dalakngalarr 1 was painted  during the same occupational phase as the axe/hoe paintings; that is, during the early European- contact period of the late 1800s or early 1900s. Dating the art panels through geomorphology Dalakgnalarr 1 occurs along the edge of an extensive rock outcrop rising up to a few tens of  metres above a creek c. 100 m to the north. In this general area, the plain that surrounds the rock  outcrop has a low gradient. The creek that drains it subdivides into numerous ill-defined and  criss-crossing channels. Here rock stacks demarcate the edge of the outcrop from the surrounding  sandy plain. These isolated rock stacks are each a few metres to a few tens of metres in height.  The low rising rock outcrop from which the stacks formed has eroded over long geological time  scales measured in the millions of years. The base of the outcrop is made up of Marlgowa Sandstone  dating to 1740–1780 million years ago, in the Proterozoic. It consists of hard quartzites that are  highly resistant to erosion (see Chapter 10). Dalakgnalarr 1 is separated from the edge of the rock outcrop by a small seasonal stream that  follows a fissure line in the bedrock. A network of narrow fissures parallel to the creek cuts the  edge of the outcrop in a criss-crossing checkerboard pattern. The eastern edge of Dalakgnalarr 1  corresponds with one of these north–south fissure lines, whereas the northern edge corresponds  with an east–west and transverse fissure (cf. Figures 13.1, 13.2). The general arrangement of the rock stacks, and the sudden edges of the outcrop, map precisely  onto these geological fissures, and it is this same geological configuration that people saw when  they first set foot on the Arnhem Land plateau around 50,000 years ago or somewhat earlier. The  rich rock art assemblages on the low rise cover, in effect, the pedestals and overhangs of these rock  formations on top and on the edge of the rock outcrop. The site of Dalakgnalarr 1 is typical of rockshelter sites in this part of Arnhem Land: a rockshelter  at the edge of rock outcrops, the size of the sheltered area depending on both the mechanical  strength of the quartzite bedrock and the fragility of the strata that are more vulnerable to physical  and chemical alteration. The decomposition of the weaker sedimentary layers causes the removal  of parts of the rock along fissure lines, thereby producing the ‘ghost rock’ or pillar landscape  evident at Nawarla Gabarnmang 17 km away (cf. Delannoy et al. 2013; see Chapter  10).  At Dalakgnalarr 1, the most vulnerable rock strata are D0 and D1 (Figure 13.2). It is from these  that the rockshelter we now know as Dalakgnalarr 1 began to take shape: after weathering, the  strata D0 and D1 quartz grains that were poorly cemented onto the bedrock were drained away  by water action. The creation of an open-ended, sheltered cavity in the rock mass led to a double  phenomenon that applies also to the formation of many other rock stacks and rockshelters of this  region (see also Chapters 10 and 15):  1. The continued enlargement of voids by chemical alteration and mechanical drainage,  causing sections of overhanging ceilings to collapse.  2. As a result of the creation of voids caused by the evacuation of altered rock along one or  more sub-horizontal rock strata consisting of less resistant matrix (1 above), the overlying  boulder mass compresses the remnant underlying strata to such a degree that it became  highly compact and highly resistant to further chemical weathering and drainage. Such  underlying remnant strata become the overlying rock mass’s pedestal upon which it now  balances (Figure 13.34).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="30"> 358    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 13.34 Evolution of rock stacks on the Arnhem Land plateau.

Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    359  Those strata with the initial voids caused by the chemical alteration and evacuation through  water action of decomposed rock are those same remnant strata that constitute the base of rock  stacks and of the rockshelter overhangs: the mechanical compression caused by the weight of the  overlying rock mass has given strong resistance to those remnant parts of the rock mass that were  initially vulnerable to chemical alteration. This process of rock stack and shelter formation, particularly clear at Dalakgnalarr 1, allows us to  frame the age of the rock art. Geomorphological evolution of the site: Archaeological  implications The geomorphology of Dalakgnalarr 1 is structured in two different ways:  1. In the northeast, it is a large rockshelter of nearly 10 m depth with a low, extensively painted  ceiling of 0.8 m to 1.8 m height. The ground level is cluttered with numerous blocks fallen  from the ceiling. 2. In the southwest, the rockshelter becomes much narrower (maximum 3 m wide) and higher  (1.8 m to 2.5 m high). It is bordered by a clutter of superimposed and overlapping blocks  that slope towards the northwest, and separated from the rock stack’s base strata by a deep  and narrow corridor.  This two-fold layout was caused by differential geomorphological evolution, although both are  subject to the same processes of rock collapse. After the main chamber at the northeast section of the site had been created by weathering and  drainage of strata D0–D1, the large, sheltered area under the overhang attained its particular  morphology through the collapse of sections of ceiling strata (Figure 13.35). The geomorphological  and archaeological evidence from the excavations suggest five major phases in the rockshelter’s  formation. Drainage of the chemically weakened strata D0–D1 sediments, and continued expansion of  this void through further chemical alteration and drainage, result in the formation of an initial  cavity sheltered by overhanging strata D3 to D22 above it. Mechanical relaxation of parts of the  rock structure, caused by the absence of underlying support, together with gravity, cause sections  of the overhanging strata D2–D3 to collapse. The geophysical data (Figure 13.11) indicate the  presence of a flat surface rock underneath an overlying clutter of fallen blocks. This flat rock  could either be bedrock or an underlying collapsed rock slab that fell flat onto the ground from  a shallow height given that the ceiling would only have been c. 50 to 60 cm above, as indicated  by the thickness of the evacuated strata D0 and D1. A process of gravitational readjustment then took effect with sections of the new stratum D4 ceiling  collapsing, deepening the rockshelter southward in the process: a collapsed section of stratum  D4 now forms the angular blocks revealed in the lower levels of the Square A excavation. The  radiocarbon dating results from Square A indicate that the collapse of stratum D4 is older than  4431 ± 25 BP (4969–5211 cal BP), as the charcoal sample came from between fallen blocks rather  than from immediately underlying deposits. A new phase of rock collapse subsequently took place,  simultaneously affecting both the front and rear of the shelter. Here, part of stratum D2 fell near the  back of the shelter, while part of stratum D5 fell near the entrance. This is today evident at ground  level by the presence of large, superimposed blocks arranged step-wise and inclined towards the  north. Given this sequence of events, the artworks on the ceiling rock surfaces newly created by this  last phase of rockfall must be later in age than the age of the stratum D5 (front of site) and stratum  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="32"> 360    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia D2 (rear of site) rockfall events. The artworks located in the middle section of the site (dating to  after the collapse of stratum D4) can themselves be older, but not older than 4969–5211 cal BP,  given the age of the stratum D4 blocks found at the base of Square A. Figure 13.35 Northwestern section of Dalakngalarr 1, showing the different rock strata referred  to in the geomorphological discussion. Source: Illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. On the northern side of the shelter are found numerous blocks that appear from their location  below the edge of the overhang to have originated from the overlying rock cap. However, the  blocks’ regular layout and relatively stable configurations suggests that they have been repositioned  along this edge of the site. Petrographic analysis and the relative positioning of the rock strata  from which these blocks came indicate that they came from within the rockshelter. Together,  the presence of unusually open spaces within the sheltered space, and repositioned blocks at the  northern edge of the overhang, indicate clearance of rock clutter at ground level. That cleared  space cannot be explained by natural erosion of fallen blocks, as erosion of the hard quartzites  that make up the rock stack’s strata took place over very long geological time scales measured in  hundreds of thousands of years; this is not consistent with the much shorter, c. 5000 years for the  roof-fall indicated by the archaeological excavations. We can only conclude that the space within  the site has been reworked by people in the past.  The southwest section of the site has witnessed a different evolution from that of the north,  although here too roof-fall was prominent. In the southwest of the site, a section of the wall  became detached from the parent rock mass  (Figure 13.36). This detachment created the  narrow corridor between the parent rock and the now-detached balancing rocks (cross-section  C–D on Figure 13.2). The detachment of rock slabs – and associated creation of the narrow  corridor – appears to be very old, resulting in the stack of balancing rocks in adjacent areas to the  northwest. The stepped arrangement of the superimposing slabs was caused by the slipping of  slabs, rock stratum by rock stratum. The most elevated strata in this rock stratigraphy are those  located furthest from the edge of the parent rock wall. This process of detachment and stacked  accumulation at ground level enables ready access (e.g. for painting) to elevated ceiling surfaces.  Accordingly, large sections of the back wall spanning from the base of the corridor to the ceiling  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="33"> 13.  Archaeology of rock art at Dalakngalarr 1, central-western Arnhem Land    361  are covered by artworks. It is likely that the oldest artworks are found in this part of the site,  because here the corridor and associated stacked detached slabs formed prior to the extant rock  surfaces in the northeastern sections of the shelter. Figure 13.36 Geomorphological evolution of Dalakngalarr 1. Stage 1: Evacuation of strata D0 and D1, previously heavily weathered over long geological time scales (see Figure 13.34). Stage 2:  Collapse of stratum D3. The low height of the roof above the ground causes the blocks to fall flat onto the bedrock. Stage 3: New  phase of roof-fall (D4) and evacuation of weathered materials from distal parts of strata D0 and D1 (at the back of the overhang).  Stage 4:  Roof-fall takes place along the front section of stratum D5 and the back section of stratum D3. Stage 5: Human occupation  at the site causes the build-up of archaeological deposits at ground level, and creates artworks on rock surfaces. It is during these  periods of occupation that collapsed blocks are removed from the sheltered area to areas outside the dripline.

Dalakngalarr 1 summarised Two broad depositional phases have been identified for Dalakngalarr 1: Phase 1 begins sometime  between 4969–5211 cal BP (Square A) and extends either continuously or intermittently to  the period 1186–1281 cal BP (Square B); Phase 2 begins between 0–290 cal BP (Square A)  and ends sometime in the early European-contact period. Through a combination of four lines  of evidence, we have been able relatively and ‘directly’ to date art to both depositional phases.  Of particular interest is the attribution of forms or ‘styles’ of X-ray art and use of specific pigment  colours to the early European-contact period. All this is consistent with other findings from  Jawoyn Country (see Chapters 11 and 12).
