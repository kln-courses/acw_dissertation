      <p>The revelation that a federal judge was reconsidering the potentially partisan nature of voter identification laws renewed important debates about the capacity of courts to adjudicate election-related disputes.<sup>1</sup> Chief among them were inquiries about the ability of litigants to present reliable information in judicial forums and that of judges to draw sound inferences from the evidence proffered. How much voter fraud actually exists? To what extent do identification requirements deter fraud as opposed to disenfranchise? Many election law scholars, for their part, have long abandoned the courts as an arena for answering such questions. In their view, not only are judges limited to the cramped records presented to them, but they also remain hopelessly mired in unproductive individual rights frameworks and vain searches for manageable standards, all the while cowed by potential political questions.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Many commentators have thus turned instead to consider alternative institutions that may be better equipped to adjudicate election-related disputes.<sup>3</sup> In the state-level redistricting context, for example, these “new institutional” proposals include shadow line-drawing entities, advisory commissions, and independent redistricting bodies.<sup>4</sup> Their underlying rationales often parallel administrative law arguments in favor of delegating policy decisions to agencies over courts, whether on the grounds of superior legitimacy, accountability, or expertise. Familiar questions of institutional independence and design abound.<sup>5</sup> It is thus surprising that more has not been made of the intersection between election and federal administrative law, notwithstanding some already valuable inroads.<sup>6</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps one explanation arises from the fact that administrative efforts at the federal level have thus far been timid; as a result, there have been few circumstances in which to apply administrative law principles directly. Other possible explanations include the path-dependent state primacy over electoral regulation, the lack of existing federal infrastructure to monitor elections nationally, as well as the weak political will to establish robust federal electoral institutions.<sup>7</sup> Last Term’s decision in <italic>Arizona v Intertribal Council of Arizona</italic>, however, helps to highlight the need for more robust theories of federal election administration.<sup>8</sup> A central issue in <italic>Intertribal</italic> was whether Arizona’s attempt to require proof of citizenship for a federal voter registration form violated the National Voter Registration Act. The Act required that states “accept and use” the federal form. The Court resolved the statutory ambiguity to mean that states could not require the submission of materials beyond those listed on the form by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). In reaching this determination, the Court ignored the EAC executive director’s opinion letter concluding the same. The agency commissioners, for their part, had deadlocked on the interpretive question. In the decision’s wake, Arizona, joined by Kansas, is currently engaged in litigation against the EAC under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>While <italic>Intertribal</italic> can be understood as a case about federalism, constitutional, or substantive election law, this article analyzes <italic>Intertribal</italic> through the lens of administrative law. In doing so, it brings to the foreground an otherwise background electoral administrative agency in the case, the EAC, and uses the suit as a springboard to explore broader themes relevant to federal election administration.<sup>10</sup> In particular, it puzzles through various analytical issues that arise when courts are called upon to resolve agency deadlocks on questions of statutory interpretation, including when commissioners should be required to give reasons for their deadlock, and whose legal opinions courts should consider. In light of such deadlocks, this article proposes an institutional understanding of <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference to interpretive documents prepared by politically insulated actors within election-related administrative agencies.<sup>11</sup> Judicial deference, it posits, should give weight to the relative independence of agency staff when politically appointed officials are otherwise deadlocked. To be clear, the claim is not that staff opinions and other guidance documents would <italic>require</italic> deference or overrule those of appointed commissioners. Rather, the argument emphasizes that such views constitute an oft-overlooked source of expertise that would be prudent for judges to consider in electoral disputes.</p>
      <p>This approach would help to vindicate otherwise under-enforced constitutional norms by flipping the conventional wisdom granting greater interpretive deference to more politically accountable actors—in situations where such actors have failed to resolve a statutory ambiguity themselves. In this manner, the proposal is a second-best solution for courts required to resolve a statutory ambiguity when first-best answers are unavailable due to institutional constraints and internal agency politics. As such, the proposal seeks to create greater incentives for internal agency independence in the presence of partisan deadlocks, as well as for the development of agency expertise through sub-regulatory materials—nonbinding, but informative, guidance documents such as agency manuals, advisory notices, or opinion letters.<sup>12</sup>
      </p>
      <p>To develop these ideas, Part I critically examines <italic>Intertribal</italic>’s background and reasoning. Part II surveys federal election-related agencies and notes that many are structured to deadlock on partisan grounds. Part III then considers how courts should treat reviewable election agency deadlocks and, in particular, how judges can benefit from agency expertise to resolve such ties. Finally, Part IV reflects more broadly on how administrative law principles might be tailored to the electoral context.</p>

         <title>Intertribal’s Impasse</title>
         <p>In December 2005, the Arizona Secretary of State’s office sent an email to the EAC with an inquiry. The year before, Arizona voters had passed a ballot initiative requiring that voting registrants provide proof of their citizenship.<sup>13</sup> Acceptable proof under the new state law included the applicant’s birth certificate or passport, naturalization papers, or driver’s license number.<sup>14</sup> The Secretary of State asked whether the EAC could add this new Arizona requirement to the federal mail-in registration form that the EAC had developed under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).<sup>15</sup> The federal form contained a section of state-specific instructions notifying state residents of what additional information they had to provide in order to register.<sup>16</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The agency’s executive director refused Arizona’s request.<sup>17</sup> His letter reasoned that the NVRA mandates that states “shall accept and use the mail voter registration application prescribed by the [EAC].”<sup>18</sup> Accordingly, the new Arizona requirements did not alter the state’s voter qualifications, but rather constituted an additional evidentiary requirement for a preexisting qualification (citizenship). Such a state-imposed requirement on the federal form would effectively result in Arizona’s refusal to “accept and use” the EAC’s form as required by the NVRA.<sup>19</sup> In the director’s view, states could not condition voter registration on the submission of materials beyond those exclusively demanded by the federal form. The NVRA “regulated the area” and therefore preempted the state’s conflicting requirements.<sup>20</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Despite this opinion letter, Arizona’s Secretary of State rejected the director’s interpretation and continued to enforce the state law to require the submission of proof of citizenship along with the federal form.<sup>21</sup> The conflict continued in both the agency and the courts. In May 2006, a consolidated group of plaintiffs, including private individuals, Indian tribes, and nonpartisan advocacy groups, filed suit in district court to enjoin various practices under the state law. The Ninth Circuit granted the plaintiffs’ emergency interlocutory injunction, only to later have the injunction vacated by the Supreme Court in <italic>Purcell v Gonzalez</italic>.<sup>22</sup> In a per curiam opinion, the Court emphasized the imminence of the then-upcoming election and the failure of the Court of Appeals to defer to the findings of the district court (which had not yet issued any factual findings and, as a result, left the Supreme Court with nothing more than a “bare order” to review).<sup>23</sup> After further litigation,<sup>24</sup> a three-judge panel and the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc eventually held that the NVRA preempted Arizona’s conflicting law under the Elections Clause; Arizona could not require the submission of proof of citizenship along with the federal registration form. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.<sup>25</sup>
         </p>
         <p>As the case was winding its way to the Court, the EAC’s four commissioners considered the legal matter in July 2006. Their deliberations resulted in a debilitating tie: two commissioners (Democratic nominations) voted against the change and two (Republication nominations) voted in favor.<sup>26</sup> Because the proposal required three votes for approval,<sup>27</sup> the federal form was not amended. Two of the commissioners released public statements regarding the basis for their votes, underscoring the contentiousness of the outcome.<sup>28</sup>
         </p>
         <p>After the agency’s deadlocked vote, Arizona took no further action with respect to the EAC—a fact Justice Scalia later emphasized at oral argument and in his eventual majority opinion.<sup>29</sup> Justice Scalia agreed with the Ninth Circuit that the NVRA’s “accept and use” provision precluded state-imposed registration requirements without EAC approval. On the one hand, Congress could preemptively regulate how federal elections were conducted under the Elections Clause; in this sense, the so-called presumption against preemption did not apply. Rather, Congress’s power under the Elections Clause was broad. Its substantive reach extended over the “times, places, and manner” of federal elections—“comprehensive words” which “embrace authority to provide a comprehensive code for congressional elections,” including regulations over federal voter registration.<sup>30</sup>
         </p>
         <p>On the other hand, the Court also made clear that states retained the power to determine <italic>which</italic> voters were qualified to vote, potentially limiting previous case law regarding the scope of Congress’s ability to determine voter qualifications.<sup>31</sup> How and where to draw this line—between a substantive qualification and a mere procedural regulation over the “manner” of federal elections subject to federal oversight—will almost surely be the subject of future litigation. One argument left open to Arizona on this question (but raised too late in the case) was that the state’s proof-of-citizenship registration requirement was itself a qualification to vote.<sup>32</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Justice Scalia suggested another possibility as well: that the state’s authority to establish voter qualifications also included the power to demand the information required for the state’s effective enforcement of its own qualifications.<sup>33</sup> Pointing to another NVRA provision declaring that the EAC-prescribed application “may require only such identifying information” as is “necessary” to determine “eligibility,”<sup>34</sup> Justice Scalia suggested that the statute might be read to require the inclusion of information essential to meaningful enforcement. In this manner, he effectively encouraged Arizona to bring suit (which it did), arguing that the EAC had a “nondiscretionary duty” to include citizenship information as “necessary” to enforce Arizona’s voter qualifications.<sup>35</sup> EAC’s inaction on or arbitrary rejection of the claim would then be subject to judicial review under the APA.<sup>36</sup> In a footnote, Justice Scalia further noted that the EAC lacked any active commissioners at the time, and wondered whether a court could compel agency action despite the agency’s lack of leadership.<sup>37</sup>
         </p>
         <p>For Justices Thomas and Alito, in dissent, the questions raised by <italic>Intertribal</italic> did not need to be resolved in administrative forums like the EAC, but rather could and should be settled in courts without bureaucratic involvement. Justice Alito, for his part, accused the majority of “send[ing] the State to traverse a veritable procedural obstacle course.”<sup>38</sup> Justice Thomas agreed.<sup>39</sup> Both Justices then took pains to point out that the EAC at the time was plagued by vacancies, with the lack of a quorum rendering the commission but an “empty shell.”<sup>40</sup>
         </p>
         <p>
            <italic>Intertribal</italic> can thus be seen as an attempt by the majority to shift back to an administrative agency, rather than a court, questions it thought better suited for an initial administrative determination. Among them: What kind of scheme—attestation backed by perjury prosecutions or formal documentation—is “necessary” for legitimately establishing voter eligibility? What kind of information would properly “effectuate” a citizenship requirement? Answers to such questions would require data and evidence that agencies would be better situated to gather relative to judicial forums, subject to the constraints of administrative law.</p>

         <title>Election-Related Agencies</title>
         <p>American federal elections are currently administered by a patchwork of federal agencies in collaboration with state and local governments, which still bear the bulk of administrative responsibilities on the ground.<sup>41</sup> While states are constitutionally charged with providing for the “times, places, and manner” of federal elections in the first instance, Congress has exercised its power to “make or alter” these regulations selectively—most notably in the areas of campaign finance,<sup>42</sup> anti-discrimination,<sup>43</sup> ballot provision,<sup>44</sup> vote-counting technology, and voter registration by both domestic<sup>45</sup> and overseas voters.<sup>46</sup> While these federal responsibilities are nontrivial, it is worth noting that they pale in comparison to the more comprehensive and centralized schemes of other countries.<sup>47</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Congress, in turn, has delegated many of these election-related responsibilities to a constellation of federal administrative agencies, notable for their structural and substantive heterogeneity. Some of these agencies, for example, have traditionally independent features such as for-cause removal restrictions and multimember boards, while others are more recognizably executive in nature through at-will removal of their agency heads by the President.<sup>48</sup> At the fore, these agencies include the EAC involved in <italic>Intertribal</italic>, the Federal Election Commission, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Defense.<sup>49</sup>

            <title>Independent Commissions</title>
            <p>More specifically, the EAC and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) are both independent agencies with a distinctive design feature: both are normally headed by an even number of commissioners with staggered terms, equally split between two political parties in practice. Specifically, the EAC usually consists of four members, two of whom are Republicans and two of whom are Democrats.<sup>50</sup> Each serves four-year staggered terms.<sup>51</sup> The EAC commissioners, in turn, choose a chair and vice chair, who also cannot be from the same political party.<sup>52</sup> The FEC is similarly composed of six members with six-year staggered terms, no more than three of whom can be affiliated with the same political party.<sup>53</sup> The FEC commissioners also choose a chair and vice chair from different political parties.<sup>54</sup>

               <title>Election Assistance Commission</title>
               <p>In addition to its four commissioners, the EAC is also statutorily authorized to have an executive director, a general counsel, and other professional staff.<sup>55</sup> The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) also created three representative advisory committees called the Technical Guidelines Development Committee, Standards Board, and the Board of Advisors.<sup>56</sup> As a substantive matter, HAVA granted the EAC the authority to disburse payments to states to replace voting systems as well as to provide guidance regarding voting system standards, testing, and certification. More generally, the statute directs the EAC to serve as a “clearinghouse” for election administration data and best practices.<sup>57</sup> HAVA explicitly denies the EAC authority, however, to issue any rules or regulations under the statute,<sup>58</sup> except in the narrow context of the mail-in voting process at issue in <italic>Intertribal</italic>.<sup>59</sup> The Attorney General, in turn, is authorized to enforce the statute and bring suits for declaratory or injunctive relief accordingly.<sup>60</sup>

            <sec id="sc2.1.2">
               <label>2. </label>
               <title>Federal Election Commission</title>
               <p>Apart from its six commissioners, the FEC also has a staff director and general counsel appointed by the commission, an inspector general, a chief financial officer, as well as a chief information officer.<sup>61</sup> Substantively, the FEC administers the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which imposes caps on election spending, limits individual candidate contributions, and requires various candidate and political action committee disclosures.<sup>62</sup> The commission administers the provisions through both rulemaking and adjudication and facilitates enforcement actions in conjunction with the DOJ.<sup>63</sup> The FEC also periodically issues advisory opinions, which are generated in response to requests by parties, candidates, and other potentially regulated entities.<sup>64</sup>
               </p>
               <p>Formal agency action for both the EAC and FEC, in turn, normally requires the bipartisan majority approval of the agencies’ commissioners. The FEC, for its part, requires a majority of commissioners to agree when making, amending, or repealing rules; issuing advisory opinions; or approving enforcement actions.<sup>65</sup> This requirement usually requires the assent of four of the FEC’s six commissioners.<sup>66</sup> The EAC, in turn, requires three-member approval for its actions—typically a majority of its four commissioners.<sup>67</sup> When coupled with the agency’s partisan balancing requirements, these voting rules help to ensure that the agencies deadlock in the absence of bipartisan agreement. Moreover, a tie vote for the FEC and EAC means that the proposed action does not proceed. By contrast, a tie vote for the International Trade  Commission (one of the only other rulemaking agencies with an even-numbered, bipartisan commission structure) means that an investigation proceeds.<sup>68</sup> As such, both the FEC and EAC are structurally biased in favor of the status quo.<sup>69</sup>
               </p>
               <p>On the one hand, these agencies’ bipartisan-vote requirements reflect lofty legislative aspirations. The FECA House Report, for example, cites the dangers of “partisan misuse” and the hope that the FEC’s majority-vote requirement would help to ensure a “mature and considered judgment.”<sup>70</sup> On the other hand, the decision rules also invite intractable impasses, particularly over significant and high-profile issues.<sup>71</sup> The EAC, for example, deadlocked 2–2 on <italic>Intertribal</italic>’s question of whether to include Arizona’s proof of citizenship requirements on the federal registration form. One commenter derided the outcome as a “partisan stalemate” in the “one area” where the agency had regulatory authority.<sup>72</sup>

            <title>Executive Agencies</title>
            <p>By comparison, there are also two prominent executive agencies with single presidentially-appointed and senate-confirmed heads, the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense. While both federal agencies also regulate elections, their scope and structure differ from the FEC and EAC in important ways.</p>
            <sec id="sc2.2.1">
               <label>1. </label>
               <title>Department of Justice</title>
               <p>The Department of Justice has been charged with helping to enforce a number of election-related statutes, including (what is left of) the Voting Rights Act (VRA).<sup>73</sup> Before <italic>Shelby County</italic> invalidated VRA Section 4’s coverage formula,<sup>74</sup> the agency administered Section 5’s preclearance regime for jurisdictions covered by the formula. Those jurisdictions had to affirmatively demonstrate that the changes would “neither ha[ve] the purpose nor … the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.”<sup>75</sup> While covered jurisdictions could submit their voting changes to the DOJ or a federal district court in Washington, D.C., more than 99 percent of the preclearance requests were submitted for DOJ administrative review.<sup>76</sup>
               </p>
               <p>The current case law would make it difficult for the DOJ to successfully claim legislative rulemaking authority under Section 5—and indeed the DOJ has not done so, explicitly treating its regulations as guidelines.<sup>77</sup> Moreover, Section 5 provides that litigants can bypass the DOJ administrative process to vindicate their claims directly in a judicial forum, further suggesting that Congress intended for the courts to play a primary interpretive role as well; the DOJ’s own regulations refer to the DOJ as a judicial “surrogate.”<sup>78</sup> Finally, the text of Section 5 also does not explicitly grant DOJ rulemaking power,<sup>79</sup> and the Attorney General’s preclearance denial letters lack precedential value.<sup>80</sup>
               </p>
               <p>While Section 5 is currently a hollow shell in <italic>Shelby County</italic>’s wake, the DOJ also enforces Section 2 of the VRA, which bans electoral structures that result in members of a class of citizens defined by race or color “hav[ing] less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.”<sup>81</sup> As such, Section 2 is a nationally applicable prohibition against voting practices and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or language minority group. It has been used, for example, to challenge redistricting plans and at-large election systems, poll worker hiring, and voter registration procedures. It prohibits not only election-related practices that are intended to be racially discriminatory, but also those that are shown to have a racially discriminatory impact.<sup>82</sup> The Act allows the Attorney General, as well as private citizens, to bring suit to obtain court-ordered remedies.<sup>83</sup> The provision does not explicitly provide the DOJ with binding rulemaking authority, nor does the DOJ claim any.<sup>84</sup>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, in terms of staffing, what is striking about the DOJ is the extent to which many of the agency’s election-related administrative duties are carried out by its career civil servants. The Civil Rights Division within the DOJ, for example, contains a dedicated Voting Section, which has had about thirty-five to forty career attorneys at any given time.<sup>85</sup> In all, the unit has about a hundred employees, comprising attorneys, social scientists, civil rights analysts, and support personnel.<sup>86</sup>

               <title>Department of Defense</title>
               <p>Like the DOJ, the Department of Defense (DOD) is another executive branch agency, with a presidentially-nominated and senate-confirmed head. The DOD has sub-delegated its election-related duties, however, to the director of the DOD’s Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP).<sup>87</sup> Substantively, FVAP is charged with administering statutes related to voting by citizens and military personnel overseas.<sup>88</sup> The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, for example, provides for a federal registration application, which allows qualified citizens abroad to register to vote and request an absentee ballot simultaneously.<sup>89</sup> Other FVAP responsibilities include developing and implementing voter registration procedures at army recruitment offices.<sup>90</sup>

         <title>Deference and Deadlocks</title>
         <p>With independent commissions structured to deadlock and executive branch agencies largely deprived of legislative rulemaking power, the emerging portrait of federal election administration is one in which some of the most important election-related statutes are being implemented, if at all, by courts. Federal administrators, by contrast, have been relegated to the sidelines despite their ability to collect cross-cutting data across various jurisdictions and to offer expert guidance beyond that selectively provided by self-interested litigants.</p>
         <p>This part considers how courts should interpret election-related statutes in light of agencies’ comparative expertise and structural incentives to deadlock. It suggests that deference should be calibrated to the institutional role of the actors authoring the interpretive documents and, specifically, the degree to which they are internally politically insulated. In this sense, it seeks to develop the idea of internal agency independence and, in doing so, to help foster legitimate tie-breaking considerations.</p>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <label>A. </label>
            <title>Tie-breakers</title>
            <p>Agency deadlocks of the kind that plagued the EAC in <italic>Intertribal</italic> pose an especially pernicious set of problems for election administration, and administrative law more generally. Deadlocks stymie the often swift and decisive resolution critically necessary before an impending election, especially given the risks of instability or perceived illegitimacy. Some, for example, have defended the Supreme Court’s intervention in <italic>Bush v Gore</italic> on the grounds that, barring all else, it provided a final resolution that helped to preserve stability and order.<sup>91</sup> In <italic>Intertribal</italic>, the imminence of Arizona’s impending election was cited to justify an expedited agency procedure in the hopes of providing a final resolution for various states.<sup>92</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Administrative deadlocks also undermine the implementation of duly-enacted laws and judicial decisions. In this sense, they can foil otherwise legitimate acts through administrative impasse. Deadlocks resulting in agency inaction can also have pernicious electoral consequences. To take one extreme example, because Illinois politicians in the early 1960s deadlocked over a new redistricting plan for the state legislature in light of new census data, all 236 candidates for 177 seats ended up running together in a single, at-large race.<sup>93</sup> More recently, the FEC has witnessed a string of 3–3 votes along party lines, with some empirical evidence suggesting a recent uptick in deadlocks for proposed enforcement actions, audits, and rulemakings.<sup>94</sup> Among the most controversial have been deadlocks preventing the FEC from promulgating meaningful disclosure rules in response to <italic>Citizens United</italic>, which upheld the statutory disclosure provisions at issue.<sup>95</sup> At one point, the impasse was so protracted that the commissioners could not even agree to accept public comments, though it eventually issued broad questions about possible regulatory approaches.<sup>96</sup> A final rule has yet to be issued.</p>
            <p>The twin challenges for federal election administration, then, are how to facilitate the application of high-quality information to the development of electoral regulatory policy when interpreting ambiguous statutes, while also resolving agency impasse in legitimate ways. While exogenous changes such as different voting rules could be ameliorative, doctrinal innovations may be warranted when institutional reforms are unlikely.<sup>97</sup> One reason this approach may be prudent in the election context is that achieving legislative agreement on election reform may be difficult, if not impossible, without attached conditions such as the even-numbered bipartisan boards that lead to deadlock in the first place.</p>
            <p>Such design choices for election-related agencies like the FEC and EAC likely reflect the congressional desire to ensure that controversial election policies do not proceed unless they serve the interests of both parties as reflected in a bipartisan majority vote. An equally plausible explanation can be couched as a legislative attempt to delay and ultimately prevent major electoral reforms by setting up such an agency structure. Under this scheme, while bipartisan consensus over how to interpret a statute would be the first-best outcome, what is a court to do when required to review the conflicting legal interpretations of split commissioners—should it determine the issue itself or defer to a particular agency actor? Answering this question requires a comparative analysis of the institutional competencies of agency and judicial actors in election-related statutory interpretation.</p>
            <p>The situation frequently arises when the underlying statute itself provides for judicial review of a deadlocked decision or, alternatively, when the suit is brought on constitutional or APA-based grounds. Whether a court will even review an agency deadlock in the first place—as opposed to, say, characterizing it as unreviewable agency inaction—depends on a number of factors including the particular statutes governing the agency and whether courts construe them to allow for judicial review. The normally three-member Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, for example, has frequently operated with only two members due to vacancies. When the two-member panel deadlocks, courts have split as to whether the resulting order is judicially reviewable. On the one hand, those that allow for review do so on the grounds that Congress could not have intended through its quorum and voting requirements to preclude judicial relief.<sup>98</sup> On the other hand, those that do not allow review usually reason that the deadlock is not a final agency action under the terms of the underlying statute. Some courts further state that the agency, when fully constituted, should bring its expertise to bear on the legal issue before courts do.<sup>99</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner, Congress can determine both the voting rules necessary for agency action, as well as the ability of courts to review the results of a deadlock under those rules. In <italic>Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) v FEC</italic>, for example, the D.C. Circuit observed that the Federal Election Campaign Act explicitly allowed for judicial review of agency proceedings that resulted in the dismissal of complaints brought under the statute.<sup>100</sup> As background, FEC enforcement proceedings are initiated either by a complaint filed with the FEC, usually by a candidate or political party, or by the FEC itself after its review of political committee reports.<sup>101</sup> Once initiated, the General Counsel’s office evaluates the matter and provides a recommendation to the six-member commission indicating whether there is “reason to believe” a legal violation has occurred or is about to occur. Should a majority of the commission concur with the General Counsel’s finding, the FEC then attempts to reach a conciliation agreement through informal negotiation with the potential violators. If negotiation does not resolve the matter, then the commission can work with the DOJ to file suit in district court.<sup>102</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Under this scheme, the <italic>DCCC</italic> plaintiffs had filed a complaint alleging that the National Republican Campaign Committee had improperly failed to allocate the cost of a mailing campaign against the relevant FECA spending cap. The complaint’s validity turned on whether the mailer constituted an “electioneering message” under the statute. The FEC’s General Counsel found reason to believe that it was, based on two previous commission advisory opinions interpreting the statutory term. When the FEC voted, however, only three commissioners agreed. With four votes required for further action, the complaint was dismissed.<sup>103</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In litigation, the FEC argued that the deadlock should be unreviewable since it purportedly resolved no substantive issue.<sup>104</sup> The court pointed out, however, that dismissals based on 5–1 or even 6–0 votes could similarly fail to resolve a decision substantively since the basis for the votes is often unclear. Perhaps the votes were the product of logrolling, legal uncertainty, or a judgment that the decision should be deferred; as a result, the court concluded, the FEC’s argument rang hollow. In the alternative, the FEC argued that deadlocks were merely unreviewable exercises of prosecutorial discretion in deciding not to pursue a complaint. Again, however, the court rejected the argument on the grounds that 3–3 deadlocks could not be distinguished from 6–0 decisions to dismiss a complaint, decisions that were clearly reviewable under FECA.</p>
            <p>As a result, the D.C. Circuit then took an intra-agency disagreement between an insulated internal actor—the General Counsel—and a split commission as reason to take a closer look at the proffered legal rationales of both sets of actors. Specifically, it held that when the FEC’s General Counsel recommends an affirmative agency action but the agency’s politically-appointed commissioners deadlock on the recommendation, the commissioners must provide a statement of reviewable reasons.<sup>105</sup> Importantly, this reason-giving requirement was justified, at least initially, only in situations when the internal staff actor disagreed with the deadlocked commission.</p>
            <p>Without this requirement, the panel noted, it would be impossible for a court to “intelligently determine” whether the commissioners were acting contrary to law or in an arbitrary and capricious manner.<sup>106</sup> The FEC, that is, sent worrisome signals of arbitrariness in the form of “conflicting messages” when the FEC dismissed a complaint without a rationale, despite seemingly contrary precedents identified by the FEC’s own General Counsel.<sup>107</sup> A later D.C. Circuit opinion offered other policy justifications for the requirement: it helped to ensure intra-agency reflection and deliberation, contributed to better reasoned outcomes, and also provided an opportunity for agency self-correction.<sup>108</sup> Indeed, one way to understand this requirement is in terms of the court’s recognition that a conflict between a senior career staff member—here, the General Counsel with a reputation for independence<sup>109</sup>—and a deadlocked board merited closer review of the latter. By imposing a reason-giving requirement, the court helped to ensure that the agency’s internal expertise could be brought to bear on the commission’s eventual resolution.</p>
            <p>When the split commission’s reasons involve contested questions of law, the next critical issue that arises, then, is <italic>which</italic> legal interpretation courts should review and grant deference to, if at all. In other words, when agencies deadlock over how to interpret an underlying statute, courts charged with reviewing the question of law will first have to determine which interpretation to consider in its review, if any, given that the agency has not been able to agree on an official one. Possibilities include the initial interpretation of the FEC’s General Counsel, the separate opinions of the commissioners, or a de novo interpretation by the court itself. Of these, the D.C. Circuit has puzzlingly held that statements issued by the bloc of commissioners voting against agency enforcement should constitute the prevailing interpretation and, what is more, that they would be entitled to <italic>Chevron</italic> deference—that is, deference to “permissible” interpretations of statutes that are otherwise ambiguous.<sup>110</sup> The court’s first premise was that the commissioners who voted to dismiss the complaint “constitute[d] a controlling group” and thus its “rationale necessarily states the agency’s reasons for acting as it did.”<sup>111</sup> Note, however, that the dismissing group comprised the “controlling” faction only because the decision to pursue the enforcement required a majority, which the faction was able to block.</p>
            <p>The court further reasoned that <italic>Chevron</italic> deference was due since the underlying statute itself evinced a legislative intent to delegate that interpretive authority and the agency exercised that authority.<sup>112</sup> Such intent can ordinarily be inferred when Congress grants an agency the power to act with the force of law through formalized procedures like notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication, and the agency employed those procedures.<sup>113</sup> Because FECA’s adjudicatory scheme was analogous to formal adjudication in essentially creating an adversarial process between the FEC’s General Counsel and the respondent, the D.C. Circuit reasoned that <italic>Chevron</italic> applied to the controlling opinions of deadlocked decisions. The court further noted, oddly, that the “Commission is <italic>inherently bipartisan</italic> in that no more than three of its six voting members may be of the same political party” as further reason for deference.<sup>114</sup>
            </p>
            <p>The D.C. Circuit’s approach, however, fails to appreciate election-specific concerns amidst the structure of agencies like the FEC. Namely, it does not recognize that a deadlocked vote within an election-related agency is functionally different than a majority vote in favor of the complaint’s dismissal, which would constitute an affirmative, bipartisan decision not to interpret the statute in a particular way. Whereas a majority vote in the election setting connotes agreement between parties, a deadlock suggests the converse: a vote split along party lines. Framed in this way, it becomes easier to see why courts should not grant <italic>Chevron</italic> deference to the deadlock coalition that successfully blocks the agency determination. As a doctrinal matter, an agency must affirmatively exercise its power to act with the force of law in order to receive deference.<sup>115</sup> To the contrary, an FEC deadlock is not an affirmative exercise of lawmaking authority according to Congress’s own voting rule, but rather the result of an agency’s inability to decide. As a result, the agency as a body has not brought either its collective expertise or policymaking judgment to bear on the relevant legal question, the “twin fonts” from which deference usually flows.<sup>116</sup> Indeed, the D.C. Circuit itself has recognized that the legal rationale adopted by the blocking coalition could not be the basis for a binding legal precedent on future cases.<sup>117</sup> Finally, from a dynamic perspective, granting <italic>Chevron</italic> deference to an agency tie also blunts the incentives of commissioners to seek bipartisan consensus; by contrast, withholding such deference until a majority is achieved is more likely to foster the cooperation across party lines that Congress desired.</p>

            <title>Internal Independence</title>
            <p>If <italic>Chevron</italic> is misplaced when agencies deadlock, courts are then left to evaluate the persuasiveness of various agency interpretations for themselves, pursuant to what is known as <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference.<sup>118</sup> Under this test, courts look at a number of <italic>Skidmore</italic> factors such as the “thoroughness” of the agency actor’s consideration, the reasoning’s “validity” and “consistency,” and, more generally, any factors which give an interpretation “power to persuade, if lacking power to control.”<sup>119</sup> The analysis applies even when the agency itself is not a party, as was the case with the EAC in <italic>Intertribal</italic>. Because <italic>Skidmore</italic>, unlike <italic>Chevron</italic>, conceives of courts rather than agencies as the primary interpreters of statutes, some have understandably questioned whether the doctrine amounts to anything more than the exercise of independent judgment in practice.<sup>120</sup> Limited empirical work, however, suggests that courts invoking <italic>Skidmore</italic> do grant deference to the agency interpretation more than when approaching the interpretive question de novo.<sup>121</sup> Indeed, there are sound reasons to think that requiring judges to explicitly consider the persuasiveness of particular interpretive views can sometimes result in different decisions on the margins.<sup>122</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Given the unique concerns of federal election administration, the primary <italic>Skidmore</italic> factor in the electoral setting should be the extent to which the agency actor is institutionally insulated from partisan influence. Instead of blindly allowing the default controlling bloc to definitively interpret an underlying statute, that is, courts should look instead at the interpretation of the actor most likely to bring to bear the agency’s expertise and administrative experience. While this approach would not necessarily modify <italic>Skidmore</italic>’s multifactor analysis as such, it would shift its emphasis and place the identity of the decision maker in the foreground when the agency regulates elections. Such <italic>Skidmore</italic> inquiries, for example, would look at indicia of political independence, such as tenure and salary protections, methods of appointment, and the degree of professionalization, among other dimensions.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference already applies to the myriad informal ways in which insulated agency actors attempt to provide guidance drawn from their expertise and experience administering the statute at issue. Tailoring such deference to political insulation would help to match <italic>Skidmore</italic>’s concerns to the institutional realities of deadlocked agencies. Internally insulated expertise in such agencies, for example, is frequently generated by career staff within them, primarily through sub-regulatory informal guidance documents or opinion letters. There are both senior career officials who hold positions in the Senior Executive Service or otherwise upper management General Schedule positions as well as the more “rank-and-file career workforce.”<sup>123</sup> In addition to career staff, agencies also often use advisory committees to provide technical advice or recommendations, subject to federal laws regulating the disclosure of meetings.<sup>124</sup> While courts currently do not apply formal deference doctrines to advisory committees, courts could critically review agency rejections of expert advisory committee opinions, especially when those opinions are required by statute.<sup>125</sup>
            </p>
            <p>While this institutional approach could extend more broadly, it is particularly appropriate in federal election administration given its heightened concerns with self-dealing and partisanship. While <italic>Skidmore</italic> speaks broadly of the “agency,” treating the “agency” as a monolithic entity makes little sense here. In Peter Strauss’s words, the “anthropomorphic tendency to treat agencies as if they were a single human actor is particularly distracting and distorting when one is analyzing a medium that the constituent elements of complex institutions use to speak to each other.”<sup>126</sup> Indeed, agencies operate according to sophisticated internal decision-making processes and personnel decisions often informed by the very expertise-related factors that courts attempt to otherwise address in an institutional vacuum. One important way that judges, like ordinary individuals, evaluate the persuasiveness or credibility of an analysis is by looking at the author’s identity and the related probability of bias and/or sound expertise. Expert witnesses in court, for example, are regularly called upon to disclose their conflicts of interest and related professional background.<sup>127</sup> For these reasons, there is great analytic value to piercing the veil of “the administrative agency,”<sup>128</sup> opening the black box to consider the actors inside.</p>
            <p>The notion of looking at the institutional role of the interpretive actor when deciding whether and how to grant deference is not new. The perspective has been advanced by two current members of the Court, among others. Justice Scalia’s dissent in <italic>United States v Mead Corporation</italic>, for example, advocated for a deference regime that would simply look to whether the interpretation is “authoritative” in the sense that it “represents the official position of the agency.”<sup>129</sup> Because the custom letter’s interpretation in <italic>Mead</italic> had been ratified by the General Counsel of the Treasury and the Solicitor General in briefs, in his view, <italic>Chevron</italic> deference was appropriate. Further developing this idea of looking at the “who” as opposed to the “how” of agency decision making, David Barron and now-Justice Elena Kagan have similarly argued that courts should give <italic>Chevron</italic> deference when the “congressional delegatee” identified by statute “takes personal responsibility for the decision.”<sup>130</sup> Such an approach, they contend, would encourage more accountable and well-considered agency decision making consistent with <italic>Chevron</italic>’s underlying policy goals.<sup>131</sup>
            </p>
            <p>While these proposals are <italic>Chevron</italic> centered, there are good reasons to extend the conceptual move to the <italic>Skidmore</italic> context as well, particularly when the regulatory domain is that of federal election administration. Unlike <italic>Chevron</italic>’s grounding in hypothetical legislative intent, <italic>Skidmore</italic>’s foundations are prudential.<sup>132</sup> 
               <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference recognizes that courts are well equipped to engage in statutory interpretation, but that they can also lack the experience and expertise to appreciate the consequences of alternative interpretations. As such, <italic>Skidmore</italic> asks judges to weigh the reasons why an interpretation is persuasive based in part on its source or “pedigree.”<sup>133</sup> Granting <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference when an informal guidance document or letter is prepared and signed by an expert, insulated career staff member would privilege the myriad documents and informal guidance reviewed by the most experienced actors within an agency, while also incorporating the experiences and insights of their subordinates. Some courts already appear to be taking into account such institutional considerations.<sup>134</sup> To be sure, the participation of high-level political appointees bears many of these same benefits in terms of drawing upon the agency’s expertise (indeed, agency heads often sign documents or interpretations that were drafted by or with the participation of career staff). But none of these benefits exist when political appointees deadlock.</p>
            <p>Functionally, it is also important to note that the proposed tailoring in the election context would simply encourage a judicial partnership with expert, internally insulated actors. It would not call for judges to abdicate their role under <italic>Skidmore</italic> in reviewing such documents; they would instead continue to consider other factors such as thoroughness and consistency. Nor would this approach allow career staff to override a valid majority decision of the commissioners when they manage to secure a bipartisan consensus. Rather, the approach developed here would apply when agencies deadlock, and courts are called upon to resolve a statutory ambiguity. <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference simply posits that courts interpreting federal election statutes would be prudent to consider the views of actors who have more experience administering elections, as well as access to information about how alternative interpretations would impact elections across jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>This interpretive approach is especially warranted given the relative institutional strengths and weaknesses of courts relative to career staff or advisory commissions in this arena. While federal judges are politically insulated by virtue of Article III tenure and salary protections, empirical evidence demonstrates that they are not immune from partisan loyalties and, to the contrary, often vote in election-related disputes in ways that favor their appointing party.<sup>135</sup> Moreover, most election administration litigation is fact-intensive and often arises in a procedural posture that requires courts to expedite their consideration of the claims based on incomplete records. As a result, judges must intervene without the requisite data to inform their decisions. These institutional weaknesses, coupled with the charged political nature of the cases, render courts (and particularly the Supreme Court) ill-suited to resolve election-related disputes.<sup>136</sup>
            </p>
            <p>By contrast, career staff within administrative agencies also have various salary and tenure protections but, in addition, also possess experience and expertise in administrating federal elections. Such staff are protected, for example, by the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, which prohibits agency personnel decisions not taken on the basis of merit.<sup>137</sup> They also have “strict tenure guarantees, have no expressed ties to the administration or to Congress, and by law are to be politically neutral.”<sup>138</sup> Furthermore, civil service salaries are protected from political appropriations decisions and the wages are also fairly compressed within the federal pay structure.<sup>139</sup>
            </p>
            <p>More importantly, these internal agency actors also possess more resources, relative to judges, to gather data across jurisdictions and over longer periods of time. Indeed, it was this need for reliable information that originally spurred Congress to create a number of bureaucratic entities charged with researching cross-cutting election administration issues. In 1971, for example, Congress created the Office of Federal Elections within what is now known as the General Accountability Office.<sup>140</sup> The entity was moved in 1974 to the FEC where it eventually became known as the Office of Election Administration, before its staff and functions were finally later transferred to the EAC.<sup>141</sup> During its various evolutions, the office commissioned a number of influential election administration studies on topics such as vote-counting technology.<sup>142</sup> In addition, it created advisory boards and disseminated information to state and local election administrators. While housed in the EAC, the staff has formulated voluntary voting system guidelines, compiled data and reports on absentee ballots for overseas voters, as well as tested and certified voting system hardware and software.<sup>143</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner, one of the main functions of federal election-related agencies has been to aggregate, develop, and solicit information about election practices across various states and even from overseas. Election administration decisions should take into account this accumulated storehouse of information and, in the context of statutory interpretation, should consider an interpretation’s persuasiveness by virtue of the experience and insulated institutional role of its author. When the role is that of making recommendations to politically-appointed commissioners based on previous experience administering the statute across a number of election cycles, then judges would be especially wise to consider those views.</p>

            <title>Implications and Objections</title>
            <p>Returning now to <italic>Intertribal</italic>, it is useful to see how the Court’s analysis might have differed when applying the institutional <italic>Skidmore</italic> approach developed here. Namely, this view of <italic>Skidmore</italic> would have drawn the Court to consider the EAC executive director’s institutional role and opinion letter in light of the agency’s deadlock, instead of ignoring the letter altogether as a basis for decision. Recall that, although the EAC is vested with rulemaking authority,<sup>144</sup> the commission split along party lines as to how to resolve the statutory ambiguity: how must states “accept and use” the federal registration form? Because it ignored the EAC executive director’s opinion, the <italic>Intertribal</italic> Court did not explicitly consider how much weight to give the letter, though the issue was raised in the merits briefs and the Court conceded that the statute was ambiguous.<sup>145</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Judge Kozinski, concurring in the Ninth Circuit’s first panel decision below, however, did consider the question. First, he observed that the director’s opinion letter lacked the “force of law” and therefore did not merit <italic>Chevron</italic> deference.<sup>146</sup> He further noted that courts did not normally grant deference to agency preemption determinations contained in informal opinion letters, but rather applied <italic>Skidmore</italic>.<sup>147</sup> While the Ninth Circuit majority acknowledged that <italic>Skidmore</italic> analysis could be appropriate, it declined to apply it on the grounds that the NVRA’s legislative history and the EAC executive director’s view were both consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s holding, and the analysis was therefore unnecessary.<sup>148</sup> In this manner, the panel, like the Supreme Court, interpreted the NVRA independently on its own and without reference to the EAC director’s well-reasoned analysis.<sup>149</sup>
            </p>
            <p>The EAC’s executive director is a senior staff position with a renewable four-year appointment “responsible for implementing EAC policy and administering EAC’s day-to-day operations.”<sup>150</sup> He is appointed by a majority vote of the commission, whose members could only consider three nominations chosen from a search committee appointed by the EAC’s Standards Board and Board of Advisors.<sup>151</sup> As such, the position requires the bipartisan vote of the commission only after nomination by expert advisory boards. The director’s duties, in turn, include maintaining the federal voter registration form and answering questions regarding the application of the NVRA and HAVA consistent with EAC’s guidance documents, regulations, advisories, and policy statements.<sup>152</sup> Though the chair of the EAC is charged with providing administrative direction to the executive director, that direction is not to be undertaken without input from each commissioner.<sup>153</sup>
            </p>
            <p>As such, the EAC executive director has experience administering the agency’s authorizing federal statutes across states and jurisdictions. Moreover, the executive director is likely to have a sound professional reputation as well as productive relationships with the state and local election officials who had nominated him.<sup>154</sup> Thus, there were multiple reasons to believe that norms of professionalism and expertise helped to bolster the independence of his position. In interpreting the NVRA, the Court would have benefited from considering the EAC executive director’s interpretive opinion for its persuasiveness in light of the institutional position of its author. While it is true that the Court’s substantive conclusion happened to align with that of the director in this case, such contingencies do not warrant the lack of judicial attention to insulated agency actors in future cases.</p>
            <p>Turning now to other implications of the <italic>Skidmore</italic> approach developed here, courts should conversely be more hesitant to grant deference to agency actors that lack the structural protections of the kind that existed for the EAC’s executive director.<sup>155</sup> Indeed, the increasing sense that the DOJ—recall, an executive agency with a single, appointed agency head—had politicized its interpretations under the Voting Rights Act (VRA) may help to explain the Supreme Court’s general refusal to defer to the agency.<sup>156</sup> Indeed, one analysis describes the Court’s recent approach as one of “anti-deference” and even “hostility.”<sup>157</sup> Helping to explain this judicial skepticism, perhaps, was the perception that the DOJ had been issuing sub-regulatory documents that were evolving according to the administration’s partisan affiliation. In this sense, the approach proposed here may help to articulate what has already been happening as a matter of course.</p>
            <p>To facilitate Section 5’s preclearance process, for example, the DOJ first published an interpretive rule for public comment in 1971 under the Republican President Nixon.<sup>158</sup> The proposal initially provided that the Attorney General would object to a preclearance submission only if he or she affirmatively determined that the law would have a discriminatory effect or purpose. In practice, this required showing constituted a more onerous standard than had previously existed. The final guidelines issued a few months later, by contrast, called for the Attorney General to object even if the evidence was still indeterminate—a change prompted only by countervailing pressure from congressional and civil rights groups.<sup>159</sup>
            </p>
            <p>The evolution of the guidelines, with revisions in 1981 and 1987, seemingly continued to track the shifting views of the administration in power.<sup>160</sup> For example, in 1985, Republican President Reagan’s DOJ initially proposed that it would refuse preclearance under Section 5 using Section 2’s result-oriented test, that is, only if the allegations showed by “clear and convincing evidence” that the change had a discriminatory result.<sup>161</sup> This policy shift would have modified the previous burden of proof under Section 5 and set a new higher evidentiary standard. In response to legislative hearings and public criticism, however, the DOJ’s finalized 1987 guidelines instead eliminated the burden shift and incorporated a results test with only a “clear” evidentiary standard.<sup>162</sup>
            </p>
            <p>More recently, in 2010, Democratic President Obama’s DOJ published a notice proposing amendments for public comment.<sup>163</sup> Among other things, the proposal sought to reflect legislative changes to Section 5, which clarified that the term “purpose” included “any discriminatory purpose” and not just those that reflected an intention to retrogress, thus potentially expanding Section 5 liability. Moreover, the regulations also clarified the nature of DOJ’s “bailout” process for covered jurisdictions, including political sub-units that were now eligible to bring a declaratory judgment suit under Section 5.<sup>164</sup> In April 2011, the DOJ issued the final rule as an interpretive rule without major changes from the proposal.<sup>165</sup>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, numerous accounts have attested to the perception that the DOJ had been varying its administration of the VRA under Republican and Democratic appointees. Various reports have circulated, for instance, suggesting that Bush Administration DOJ officials had prohibited career staff attorneys from offering written recommendations in high-profile VRA determinations.<sup>166</sup> Not only did this new practice “mark[ ] a significant change in the procedures meant to insulate such decisions from politics,” but it also followed on the heels of rare reversals by high-level political officials of career staff preclearance recommendations.<sup>167</sup> This dynamic of silencing or overruling internal dissent appears to have continued through the Obama Administration as well,<sup>168</sup> though recent DOJ officials have attempted to publicly distance themselves from such practices and profess to no longer prohibit written career staff opinions.<sup>169</sup> In this manner, the same executive agency which reportedly had been silencing its career attorneys had also been issuing guidance that sought to reflect the preferences of the political appointees in power. The Supreme Court’s reluctance to grant deference under these circumstances, to agency actors that lacked internal mechanisms of political independence, would be consistent with the analysis developed here.</p>
            <p>However persuasive the institutional <italic>Skidmore</italic> approach as an explanatory matter, one might still normatively object to it on a number of grounds. For starters, one might worry that this deference regime is somehow inconsistent with legislative intent. If Congress had wanted to create an expert, nonpartisan election administration agency with a permanent staff, it could have done so. Instead, it set up a politically appointed commission and protected against partisanship through a bipartisan voting rule. Asking judges to consider the views of career staff or other agency actors regarding questions of law somehow contravenes these conscious design choices. The piece that this objection elides, however, is that the legal issue arises whenever Congress provides for judicial review of the agency’s deadlock, sometimes explicitly as in the case of FEC enforcement proceedings or implicitly through a choice not to preclude review.<sup>170</sup> Thus, as previously discussed, when the rationale for the agency’s deadlock raises a contested legal question, courts will be called upon to resolve the statutory ambiguity. Judges, that is, will effectively have to break the tie regarding how an underlying statute should be interpreted. As such, the familiar administrative law question that arises is one of comparative institutional competence, whether such reviewable statutory ambiguities are better entrusted to a court acting alone or rather as a cooperative endeavor between courts and expert agency actors when commissioners deadlock on the issue.</p>
            <p>Beyond concerns about subverted legislative intent are worries about partisan capture or deeper politicization that may result from the deference regime. Because courts would place a thumb on the scale for sub-regulatory guidance documents written by, say, senior career staff, general counsels, or advisory committee members, political parties would simply refocus their lobbying efforts accordingly, resulting in the heightened risk of partisan capture. By the same token, this regime could erode norms of independence over time or entrench partisanship even deeper within the agency by encouraging politicized hiring practices. Political appointees, moreover, may now be more likely to increase their monitoring and control of staff memoranda, or even attempt to manipulate the contents of such documents themselves. Alternatively, agency heads may simply silence or reduce the amount of otherwise useful guidance available to regulated entities.</p>
            <p>While these objections are real and powerful, they are mitigated by a number of countervailing observations. First, as an institutional matter, there are various federal laws that limit the influence of interest groups and political parties on civil servants. The Pendleton Act, for example, prohibits agencies from making particular non-merit-based personnel actions and sends appeals of such decisions to an independent Merit Systems Protection Board.<sup>171</sup> The Hatch Act restricts executive branch civil servants from engaging in partisan political activity.<sup>172</sup> Other federal statutes and regulations also prohibit non-merit-based hiring and personnel decisions for civil servants.<sup>173</sup> Structurally, the ability to capture staff members would also be more difficult in multimember commissions, relative to single-headed agencies, since other commissioners (especially from the opposing party) could object to and check such efforts.</p>
            <p>Beyond these formal buffers are informal ones as well. The reputations of election administrators, for instance, are strongly dependent on their perceived independence from special interests and adherence to professional norms.<sup>174</sup> Being an effective election administrator, that is, depends in large part on maintaining actual and perceived independence from parties and candidates. Thus, the incentives for partisan capture are blunted by the costs that such capture would impose on an administrator’s professional reputation as well as her ongoing institutional efficacy. Perhaps one fruitful analogy here is to the Solicitor General’s Office, which by many accounts draws its influence over the Supreme Court from its perceived political independence and reputation as an honest broker.<sup>175</sup> Actions that erode either erode the power of the office itself.<sup>176</sup> Similarly, those who work at federal election agencies also draw their credibility from being able to resist pressures that are baldly partisan.</p>
            <p>At a broader level are potential inter-institutional dynamics as well. Administrative agencies are the agents of multiple principals, including the President, Congress, and the courts. As such, the more an election-related agency loses its institutional credibility—say, because of capture, corruption, or a failure to incorporate new data—the more likely other institutions may be to step in to check it. This dynamic, as discussed, is one possible explanation for the Supreme Court’s refusal to grant deference to what has been perceived as an increasingly politicized DOJ. A similar argument has been made to explain the Court’s withholding of deference in other regulatory contexts, for example, when invalidating the EPA’s refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions—a decision perhaps arising from the Court’s perception that there had been high-level political interference with the expert, scientific judgments of EPA career staff.<sup>177</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In terms of intra-agency dynamics, consider also that any agency heads or commissioners tempted to silence or otherwise unduly influence staff recommendations are faced with a trade-off between reaching a bipartisan decision and gaining <italic>Chevron</italic> deference, which favors the agency, or settling for <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference, which leaves interpretive authority with the courts. Faced with this choice, these appointed officials can gain more deference by securing a majority agreement among themselves, instead of leaving open the ambiguity to the uncertainties of <italic>Skidmore</italic> as a result of partisan deadlock. In this manner, there are relative incentives for commissioners to avoid administrative impasse and devote resources to finding bipartisan interpretations rather than micromanaging informal staff documents. Furthermore, any efforts to silence opinion letters must also be weighed against the need to provide guidance to outside regulated entities. In other words, there will always be an external demand for sub-regulatory guidance despite internal pressures not to issue any.</p>
            <p>Apart from concerns about partisan capture and interference, however, is yet another distinct worry: that greater judicial attention to the views of insulated staff members will result in commissioner deadlocks about the hiring of such staff.<sup>178</sup> In other words, because the stakes of appointing these internal actors now seem greater, commissioners will be more likely to disagree about who should be appointed, thus resulting in staff vacancies. While this fear is well founded, its manifestation in reality will likely depend on a number of factors, including the polarizing effects of potential candidates as well as the long-term viability of protracted staff-related deadlocks. There are also a number of practices that can help to mitigate contentious hiring disputes, some of which are already required by statute or deployed in practice in other settings such as the arbitration of deadlocked labor disputes.<sup>179</sup> For example, statutes underlying the Election Assistance Commission currently require the agency’s executive director to be chosen from three nominations generated by a search committee, which is itself appointed by outside advisory bodies.<sup>180</sup> Such approaches, which constrain the number and nature of potential staff candidates as well as draw upon the involvement of external bodies, can help to ameliorate the increased potential for impasse.</p>

         <title>Federal Election Administration</title>
         <p>Ongoing litigation regarding Arizona’s proof-of-citizenship requirements, as in a recent case brought against the EAC itself, will continue to highlight the intersection between federal election and administrative law.<sup>181</sup> Among other issues will be the question identified by Justice Scalia in <italic>Intertribal</italic>—now arising out of legislative, as opposed to administrative, deadlock: Can agencies without any appointed commissioners still act on behalf of the agency? To date, in response to a court order, the professional staff of the EAC has issued a memorandum arguing that the staff possesses the sub-delegated authority under the circumstances to resolve state requests to amend the federal form.<sup>182</sup> In light of recent changes to filibuster rules, the issue may soon become moot as a practical matter if Congress moves ahead on potential EAC nominations.<sup>183</sup> Other important issues to be resolved include whether and when the EAC’s decisions can be considered final, reviewable actions under the APA.</p>
         <p>While this article’s analysis of the comparative institutional competence of insulated career staff may help to bolster the EAC’s arguments going forward, this part offers some broader reflections about how administrative law may be adapted in the electoral context—themes to be more fully developed in future work. Indeed, administrative law, as traditionally conceived, is trans-substantive. It presumes principles generally applicable across a number of agencies and formulates its doctrines accordingly.<sup>184</sup> There are many reasons to think, however, that such doctrines should be adapted to the election administration context in ways that acknowledge the domain’s unique concerns. Such shifts would resonate with broader evolutions in administrative law that reflect what Richard Pildes refers to as “new ‘realist’ political-economy analysis of agency functioning.”<sup>185</sup> In other words, doctrinal refinements for election-related administrative agencies would align with other judicial innovations that have similarly embraced the on-the-ground institutional realities faced by particular administrative agencies.</p>
         <p>In recent years, judges and scholars alike have begun to recognize the potential wisdom of such tailored approaches. Richard Levy and Robert Glicksman, for example, observe a phenomenon they call “agency-specific precedents.”<sup>186</sup> Precedents are agency-specific when a court only cites them for a particular agency in other cases involving that agency, even when the cited principles are supposedly general in nature. What is particularly striking about the practice is that courts have begun to modify these principles to accommodate particular characteristics of these agencies.<sup>187</sup> One traditional articulation of arbitrary-and-capricious review, for example, asks “whether the [agency] decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.”<sup>188</sup> In the narrow contexts of the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, however, Levy and Glicksman note that courts regularly invoke a different verbal formulation—simply that of “reasoned decisionmaking.”<sup>189</sup> They argue that this alternative approach emphasizes a more rational decision-making <italic>process</italic>, as opposed to a focus on the substance of the decision itself. One potential explanation they offer is that the agencies at issue engage in ratemaking and licensing in regulated industries, which place a greater emphasis on procedural protections.<sup>190</sup>
         </p>
         <p>To the extent courts are already de facto adapting administrative law principles to the shared concerns of particular agencies, a related possibility is that such customization should recognize the unique problems of federal election administration. The idea arises from the analogous argument that the exceptional nature of elections warrants particularized constitutional doctrines. In this view, the First Amendment, for example, should give some kinds of electoral speech less protection relative to nonelectoral speech in order to facilitate the heightened contest of ideas during election season.<sup>191</sup> The Equal Protection Clause too has received election-specific modifications. The Supreme Court’s recent redistricting cases, for instance, have allowed for more race-conscious line-drawing than in other equal protection arenas, with the Court adopting a “predominant” factor rather than a “motivating” factor test for identifying impermissible racial motive.<sup>192</sup> One rationale is that voters voluntarily identify by race when forming political organizations, thus necessitating the recognition of legitimate group interests in the redistricting process.<sup>193</sup> Similarly, <italic>Baker v Carr</italic>’s one-person, one-vote standard is unique as one of the only contexts in which strict scrutiny is applied in the absence of a discriminatory purpose or suspect classification and has “imposed a mathematical rigor on the redistricting process that no other species of equal protection law required.”<sup>194</sup> Partisan gerrymandering doctrines too allow the state to intentionally disadvantage the otherwise constitutionally protected characteristic of political affiliation.<sup>195</sup>
         </p>
         <p>These election-specific constitutional doctrines also have statutory analogues. Richard Hasen, for instance, identifies “democracy canons” of interpretation in state courts and advocates their use in federal settings as well.<sup>196</sup> Such canons generally seek to “give effect to the will of the majority” and “prevent the disenfranchisement of legal voters” when election-related statutes are otherwise ambiguous.<sup>197</sup> When applied, they usually counsel in favor of allowing ballots to be cast and counted and to enable candidates to appear on ballots.<sup>198</sup> Just as constitutional and statutory concerns might take on novel dimensions when elections are at issue, so too might administrative law’s worries about nonarbitrariness, transparency, and reasoned decision making, among others. What works wholesale, that is, may need retail-level refinement.</p>
         <p>Indeed, one of administrative law’s central concerns is how to legitimate government action by an unelected bureaucracy through doctrines and procedures grounded in both political accountability and expertise. Along the first dimension, the nondelegation doctrine, for instance, requires that broad delegations of legislative power are constrained by an “intelligible principle”<sup>199</sup> to which legislators can be held responsible. Given Congress’s broad delegations in practice, however, the President has also become an important locus of accountability, particularly through his appointment, removal, and review powers.<sup>200</sup> Central to these accountability-grounded accounts is the notion that federal elections can help to ensure that regulatory policies are responsive to the democratic will.</p>
         <p>In the context of election regulation, however, the political control model falters. Instead of relying on elections as an exogenous check on the regulatory process, election administration influences the election outcomes themselves. As a result, there is a potential circularity: the very source of legitimacy for the agency action is a function of the agency action itself. In these circumstances, elections are a less reliable check on agency decision making when they instead reflect partisan efforts to distort signals of voter approval or disapproval.<sup>201</sup> Related are familiar fears of partisan entrenchment, the worry that an appointed administrator can manipulate the voting process to keep their favored party in power.<sup>202</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Potentially more appropriate, then, is another familiar framework for justifying the delegation of policymaking authority: one grounded in the agency’s superior expertise and experience. Hard-look review helps to ensure that agencies make factual and scientific judgments based on the evidence available in the record.<sup>203</sup> Indeed, as this article has argued, federal election administration can benefit greatly from states’ experiences as well as from lessons learned from previous federal election cycles.<sup>204</sup> Many of the recent debates about voter identification revolve around contested facts regarding the true rates of voter fraud or racial disenfranchisement. In response, some have proposed information-forcing reforms such as electoral impact statements<sup>205</sup> or the application of risk-regulation principles.<sup>206</sup> In this manner, the legitimacy of a federal election agency depends heavily on its ability to rationalize and inform electoral administration.</p>
         <p>At the same time, purely nonpartisan rationales grounded solely in expertise may be naive in a context where administrators are appointed or hired by individuals with partisan affiliations.<sup>207</sup> Many election regulations also require line-drawing exercises—as in <italic>Intertribal</italic>’s question of how much information is “necessary” to enforce voter qualifications—which often cannot be answered by reference to pure expertise, but are rather discretionary exercises of judgment. As a result, election administration may also need other sources of legitimacy.</p>
         <p>Perhaps one possibility suggested by this article’s analysis is that of bipartisanship, the extent to which a regulatory decision has been agreed to by both political parties in a two-party system. This criteria would mirror the structural choices made by Congress for agencies like the FEC and EAC, as discussed. Relative to single-party domination, bipartisan decisions may be less suspect given the greater prospect of decisions based on the public interest rather than narrowly partisan grounds. Since they require the approval of two parties, bipartisan decisions are more likely to concern the electoral system as a whole, rather than attempts to disadvantage a particular party. Privileging bipartisan requirements may also contribute to greater stability over time since they render less likely sudden policy shifts due to contingent situations of unified government.<sup>208</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The danger with bipartisan decisions, however, arises from the concern that political parties will collude to weaken the political process at the expense of voters. Some have argued that this danger is particularly acute in the redistricting context, though empirical evidence may suggest that such concerns are overstated.<sup>209</sup> Because of such worries, neither bipartisan, nor expert, nonpartisan considerations may be sufficient legitimizing rationales on their own. Rather, perhaps they must operate in tandem as proxies to guard against arbitrary regulatory policies designed to entrench. A lack of bipartisanship, for instance, might invite a heightened judicial review of the evidence-based rationale for a change in electoral regulation. Conversely, the presence of bipartisanship might warrant only ordinary arbitrary-and-capricious review of the underlying supporting data and evidence.<sup>210</sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Prior to last Term, election law observers had presciently predicted that the future of voting rights would shift from the VRA’s antidiscrimination model toward more national, uniform approaches that “better fit” the increasingly recognized need for consistency across electoral jurisdictions.<sup>211</sup> Recent events such as the establishment of a presidential commission to address federal election administration further signal the potentially expanding regulatory presence in this domain.<sup>212</sup> As the <italic>Intertribal</italic> litigation suggests, a federal approach also brings with it the greater need for high-quality information and data to justify alternative regulatory approaches. This need is highlighted by the self-professed difficulties courts face in gaining this information.</p>
         <p>To confront this challenge, this article has sought to highlight some potentially fruitful intersections between administrative and election law. Faced with deadlocks unique to the election context, the analysis developed an approach to <italic>Skidmore</italic> deference that would push courts to focus on the information and expertise gained by experienced institutional actors who could bring a more birds-eye view across various electoral jurisdictions. Future litigation arising out of <italic>Intertribal</italic> will continue to test the limits of judges’ abilities to sort through limited factual records. At the same time, it will rightly bring the dispute firmly back to administrative arenas with the tools and doctrines that can help to foster the legitimacy that federal election administration demands.</p>
