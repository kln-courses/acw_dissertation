Arnold van Gennep, Les Rites de Passage. Paris, Nourry 1909. There is, after all, something not wholly evil in our modern civilisation. Paradoxical as the remark may seem, to readers of "Les Rites de Passage", by M. Arnold van Gennep, it will not appear a paradox. Mankind, and indeed the whole nature of things as far as we know it are eternally passing from one stage or condition to another. Heraditus observed this long ago, "all things", he said, "are in a state of flux". But human beings "vacant of our glorious gains", savages, barbarians, and even peoples who ought to know better, mark every transition in human life by a rite or ceremony, and the rites are often prolonged, disgusting, exquisitely painful, extremely absurd« and sometimes expensive. According to some definitions of Religion, they are religious: or magico-religious, but in that there is not much consolation for the sufferers, at least to persons who are in a religious condition which is not that of the pious Arunta or the devout Zuñi, It is not of the Christian rites confirmation, marriage, and death that a man can complain; and of course the complete agnostic is wholly unvexed by any rites except those which he invents for himself. In modern life the nearest thing to a savage or barbaric rite is Vaccination, and in England the noncon- formists usually resent and resist Vaccination, probably from a hereditary dislike of conforming to any rule imposed either by Church or State. But even if Vaccination be a rite it is not a religious rite. We shall presently see that the savage kind of rites, in modern society, are not religious; and that they appear to be survivals of the savage passion for causing pain, and discomfort, and ennui. M. van Gennep, if I am not mistaken, has underestimated the influence exerted by this unamiable passion. He justly observes that to the savage (with his great leading idea of hurting, bewildering, and, as we say "boring" his fellow creatures' "every change in the situation of an individual brings in actions and reactions between the profane and the sacred". Thus to the savage his sister, or at least his younger sister, his mother-in-law, perhaps his father-in- law, are all sacrés. If he meets them he has to hide, or to run away, rites highly inconvenient. If a man who is abroad is reported, falsely, to be dead, when he comes home there is a rite ; he is lowered down through the chimney, or a hole is broken through the wall of his house. A pious Jew, it seems, cannot run out of doors without touching the mazuza, kissing his finger, and uttering an ejaculation. In important matters, such as marringe among the Arunta, an unspeakable stt of cruel and disgusting rites have to be performed at the expence of the bride. M. van Gennep calculates that one and the same rite may be classed in sixteen different ways. I do not know how the savage or superstitious man would class them, but suspect that he would say that he performs them "for luck". They are traditionally "lucky". One may add</page><page sequence="2">bibliographic. 825 that many persons in modern society, even persons wholly destitute of religion, invent rites for themselves. Monsieur Zola (about whose religious views I am destitute of information), invented many original rites for himself, and so did Dr Johnson, who was a deeply religious man. But it was not the religion of the Qiurch of England that impelled Dr Johnson to touch every post in the street, or to enter a house according to a ritual of his own invention. He did these and many other strange rites "for luck", though why he thought them lucky he himself could not have explained. He could not have told us, like M. van Gennep, that any of his rites was "dyhamist, contagionist, indirect". M. van Gennep explains his own terminology. "By dynamism is to be understood the impersonal theory of mana; by animism, the personalist theory that the power personified is a single spirit, or several spirits, an animal or vegetable power (totem), anthropomorphic or formless (God/*. "These theories constitute religion, and the technique of religion (ceremonies, rites, cults) I call magic." Thus when Dr Johnson touched a post for luck, or was godfather to a child, his theory was in both cases religion, his action was magic. He would have knocked you down if you had told him so, for he was a person of great strength and ungovemed passions, but I need not say that to knock a man down is not argument. Dr Johnson may have considered the act religious, but his definition of religion was not that proposed by M. van Gennep. So much do philosophers differ that I do not, myself, regard the belief in mana (or in luck), as "religious", nor do 1 regard Christian marriage or burial as a "magical" rite. Rites of initiation, whether religious or not religious, arc at least exemples of savage and barbaric delight in tormenting people. Many of them occur at the period, as M. van Gennep observes, of social, not necessarily of actual purity, and mark the passage from the "monde asexué" to the "monde asexuel". The word "asexué" is new to me, and appears to be constructed by taking the Greek à privative to a word of Latin origin. However we see what M. van Gennep means. Among the rites of initiation, circumcision is common, though with the Jews it has nothing to do with puberty. M. van Gennep regards circumcision as merely one of many ways of "visibly modifying the personality of an individual" when he passes from one social grade into another. In these rites the savage shows his ferocity. We still mark grades in the Service by variations in the uniform, whereas the savage hacks and chops the bodies of the young initiates. Now when the savage goes wholly naked, the initiate, male or female, might be marked by an elegant decorative pattern on the body, or might wear a feather in the hair. But tliat would not hurt the initiate, so the savage knocks out his front teeth, or cuts off the last joint of his little finger, or performs other and more painful and dangerous mutilations in Central and Northern Australia ; or flogs the boys ferociously ; or suspends them by hooks thrust into their shoulders; while, after the torments, the miserable lads are nearly starved, are driven into the wilderness, and generally are made most uncomfortable. It appears to me that the savage does these things because he likes to do them, and perhaps he also wants to "harden the boys", and to teach them "to rough it", as English people say when they send their sons to public schools. "The final act is a religious ceremony, where the belief in Daramulun &amp;c. exists", says M. van Gennep (p. 108). Does he mean that here alone any of the acts arc religious, that the tortures and mummeries are not religious? That would seem inconsistent. M. van Gennep has not space for a full discussion of the ancient Greek mysteries. Had people to be initiated at a given age? Had initiation once been compulsory, and what does "Aiade Mysthai" mean? The aspirates, surely, are misplaced. Much in the Eleusinian Mysteries resembles the Australian, and it would be interesting to read a more copious study of the subject. M. van Gennep rejects M. Foucarts theory that the Eleusinian were borrowed from the Egyptian mysteries, a point which I also have argued in the Introduction to a translation of the Homeric Hymns. M. van Gennep then treats "le scenario du Rituel romain", as "a se- quence of rites of separation, of margin, and of aggregation". He must admit that it is a great advance on a system of mutilation and maltreatment. M. van Gennep disappoints me by not entering into the topic of the rites of Free Masonry. Arc they religious, magical, or both, or neither? These things, of which M. van Gennep may know as little as I do, cannot be revealed to the profane; they are "mysteries mure than Eleusinian". But to the anthropologist they arc Ainliroi&gt;os IV. 1909. 1*</page><page sequence="3">826 Bibliographie« full of interest, as they attest the survival among civilised men of the savage delight in a secret, and in severing the sacred, the Free Masons, from the profane. Our habit of wearing clothes in society prevents us from discovering whether Free Masons are mutilated or not, and the only anthropological Free Mason of my acquaintance merely says that "these things are rather curious". M. van Gennep's book, like everything which he writes, is learned, judicious, and me- thodical. It definitely proves that, contrary to the opinion of J. J. Rousseau, there is something to be said for civilisation as against the return to a state of nature in which man's leading object is to disfigure the bodies of his juniors as nature made them. But I miss a discussion of Masonic rites and of the privately invented rites of individuals in modern society. Andrew Lang - London.</page></plain_text>
