The second of a projected five-volume series, this exhaustive study of Lega, Bembe, Nyanga, Mbole, Mitoko, Lengola, and twelve other Bantu-speaking peoples is a triumph of painstaking library and museum research combined with extensive field research ex- tending over two decades. The author long ago established an enviable reputation for superbly detailed studies of the art, religion, and mythology of the Lega, and over 200 pages of this work are also dedicated to this eastern Zaire ethnic group. Since all these peoples share some aspects of the bwami vol- untary association, this concentration is logi- cal, especially since the art, mostly small sculptures in wood, ivory, and bone, is pro- duced solely for use in initiation or for display- ing status in this institution. The book is organized rather like a museum catalogue, beginning with a short (36 pp.) dis- cussion of the way bwami combines sculpture with folkloric aphorism in initiation per- formances during which "obsessive concern is expressed about disruptions caused by female witches and by adulterous and quar- relsome women," those who are "meddle- some, arrogant, quarrelsome, unsettled, easy, talkative, and competitive," attitudes not un- known in other societies. At the same time the bwami members' "high morality" is praised: "they are not fighters or quarrelsome peo- ple, ... seducers, slanderers, or hypocrites," but rather they speak about "the state of plenitude, immunity, and quasi immortality they have reached" (p. 33). The catalogue begins with a presentation of anthropomorphic figures, some 2,000 of which are known, describing their meaning, functions, and acquisition as well as the com- plex terminology of their use. The third chap- ter records some 18 types of zoomorphic figurines such as pangolin, chameleon, an- telope, frog, snake, fish, and bird, placing them in their functional contexts in initiations of the high yananio and kindi ranks of bwami. Masks of five types are the subjects of Part 4, all small and displayed rather than worn, their meaning subtly changing depending on surroundings, context, and proverbs being sung. Throughout the author rightly stresses the exceeding complexity of meaning of these small and sometimes crude sculptures, and the gross oversimplifications of fact in most previous studies of them. The fifth chapter is the well-known miscellany, describing over 30 types of sculpture such as ax blades, tools, dugout canoes, spoons, stools, canes, and phallic sculptures, many with multiple levels of meaning. The last chapter discusses the re- 14</page><page sequence="2">lationship of the Lega and their bwami institu- tion with their neighbors, and what little is known about the interplay of bwami and the local traditions of these historically in- tertwined peoples. The 10 diagrams in the ap- pendix give different versions of the geneal- ogy of these related peoples from the ances- tral Lega, but their complexity is daunting for anyone not conversant with ethnic nomencla- ture. The photographs between pages 108 and 109 are of good quality, and their captions are full of facts useful for comparison. Finally, the bibliography is sharply focused, and includes a number of obscure but important ethno- graphic reports from colonial publications. For readers of this journal and all collectors, this scholarly work will be a standard author- ity on the art of the Lega and related peoples for years to come. But that is not to say that it is easy reading or that it offers much comfort for those seeking a straightforward pro- venience for their beloved ivory. Indeed, there will be those who say that this book is an example of "too much of a good thing," pro- viding a welter of details, no matter how fas- cinating, without providing the typology, no matter how complex or tentative, that would make the art accessible and structure its future investigation. Others might cite the dis- couraging lack of specificity about names and functions of Poro masks, or the relation be- tween style, use, and provenience in Bamana Chiwara headdresses or Yoruba ibeji figures. But sometimes the field data really will not fit into neat categories, and those who care about the nuances of an object or a style must pay the price, learn the foreign argot, and read the fine print. For those lucky enough to own a bwami ivory, or even just to admire one in a museum case, this book is the place to start. Daniel J. Crowley University of California, Davis</page></plain_text>
