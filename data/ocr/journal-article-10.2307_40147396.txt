Le rose di Evita is Nico Orengo's seventh novel, which, together with three books of poetry, completes his literary credentials to date. In these works he explores the meaning of the world with which he is most familiar, the seemingly routine lives of average individuals whose experience is tied to the hills between Turin, where the author was born in 1944, and the seacoast of the Italian Riviera. The outwardly uneventful and relatively repetitive lives of the characters in Orengo's narratives contrast with their complex emotional intricacies, which assail their inquiring minds caught in the throes of baffling circumstances. In- deed the events and the plot of Orengo's narratives are so unassuming that in Le rose di Evita's initial paragraph, which marks one of the very few authorial interventions, the narrator feels the need to remind the reader of the extraordinary quality of stories: "Stories, just stories every- one thought. But to Giuseppe, Lisa, and Marco they meant everything. " Thus the author stresses the significance of narratives in structuring one's experience. The cognitive role of literary art seems in fact to be Orengo's primary goal in shaping his narrative microcosm. For his characters, even small events, however seemingly insignificant, collide against the routines of their lives and their accepted notions "with the violence of a sea wave. " The sea and the land of Orengo's native region are often the silent though eloquent participants in the inner drama of his characters. Indeed nature, in both its elemental and its organic, living forms, its flora and fauna, is an important component of Orengo's imaginary world. Botany and ich- thyology in particular constitute an inexhaustible source of interlocutors who, through their elemental language, bring to light the complexities of man's emotional experience. In Cartoline di mare, Orengo's most recent book of poetry (1984), which Maria Corti placed in the tradition of La Fontaine - without, one must add, the latter' s moralizing and obvious anthropomorphism - the author "observes ' the unfolding of life's essential truths in the rich and varied pithy episodes enacted by the sea world. In Le rose di Evita the celebrated flower is a significant force in the lives of the characters. Its inexplicable magnet- ism engages the father in a heroic struggle to transform a barren hillside into a fertile bed for planting roses. In fact, although it is not explicitly stated (Orengo never flaunts overt rational explanations for the subterranean life of the passions, as witness Miramare and Dogana d'amore; see respectively WLT 64:2, p. 291, and 61:4, p. 614), the superhuman struggle that the father undertakes - a clear sign of his unbending dedication to the roses - is at least in part an explanation for his wife's jealousy and separation from him. As in several other novels by Orengo that feature a young man as the protagonist, in Le rose di Evita the major role is assigned to Marco, the adolescent boy whose conscience</page><page sequence="2">470 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY expands as he seeks to understand the events he witnesses. The third-person narrator's point of view is limited to the subjective vision of Marco. His instinct and need to know and understand the elusive, mystifying world in which he lives sets him on a quest. As his knowledge of others and of the past is acquired, Marco gradually attains self-discovery. The past is constituted primarily by another "story" that in some ways parallels the one enacted by his own parents. This other story leads Marco to learn about his grand- father's passion for roses, which caused him to abandon for a number of years his own wife to become Evita Peron's private gardener in Argentina. The discovery of the circumstances in which his grand- father's drama unfolded becomes the focal point of Marco's investigations, but the real actant that is manifested by the various actors employed in Orengo's narrative is the occult smoldering of human passion for an ideal, a mysterious attraction for the rich, the beautiful, and the exotic that abound all around, provided one learns to recognize their signs. In Le rose di Evita Nico Orengo has taken the reader one step closer to the mastery of deciphering the secret rules of experience immanent everywhere in the human environment. .
