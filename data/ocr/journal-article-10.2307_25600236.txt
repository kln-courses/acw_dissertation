<plain_text><page sequence="1">JANE K. BROWN The Tyranny of the Ideal: The Dialectics of Art in Goethe's "Novelle" Goethe first began to think about the epic which later became the "Novelle" in 1797. This year was also important in his thinking about painting, for he was engaged in what turned out to be a funda mental reinterpretation of the neoclassical hierarchy of genres, the doc trine of the compatibility of various objects and styles in painting.1 As preparation for his new journal, Die Propylden, Goethe asked his friend J. H. Meyer to write an essay on this doctrine, which appeared under the title "Uber die Gegenstande der bildenden Kunst." At the same time he wrote a sketch on this subject himself. Meyer's essay presents the standard neoclassical version of the hierarchy, a progressive scheme of genres ranging from so-called indifferent subjects at the bottom, such as Dutch genre painting, through landscape and history to religious painting at the top.2 The hierarchy thus progresses from real to ideal, or to what Goethe sometimes called "symbolic." Goethe's sketch, on the other hand, distinguishes basically two types of subjects?"natural" and "ideal." Their relationship is not progressive in Goethe's presenta tion, for the "ideal" necessarily subsumes and also opposes the "natu ral." The difference between Goethe's sketch and Meyer's essay shows i. From his earliest years Goethe had been a major German exponent of neoclassical art theory. Even after he gave up his ambitions to be a painter himself, he attempted to promote his ideas on the idealizing role of art?as collector, as critic, as editor of journals devoted to art, and above all as poet. As early as 1770 Goethe reports having read Reynolds' first Discourse and comments, "er dringt besonders auf die Correktion, und auf das Gefuhl der Idealischen stillen Grosse. Er hat Recht . . ." (In "Ephemerides," Gedenkausgabe, iv, [Zurich: Artemis, 1953], 973). The introduction to his journal Die Propylden (1798) emphatically takes the same position: "Der echte gesetzgebende Kunstler strebt nach Kunstwahrheit, der gesetzlose, der einem blinden Trieb folgt, nach Natur wirklichkeit; durch jenen wird die Kunst zum hochsten Gipfel, durch diesen auf ihre niedrigste Stufe gebracht." (Hamburger Ausgabe, xii [Hamburg: Wegner, 1963], 49). 2. The hierarchy of genres was a commonplace in the eighteenth century; lectures three and four of Reynolds' Discourses on Art contain a classical statement ofthe doctrine. SiR, 19 (Summer 1980) 217</page><page sequence="2">218 JANE K. BROWN Goethe transforming the progressive structure of the hierarchy into his own version of the Romantic dialectic of real and ideal. The relevance of Goethe's theorizing on painting to the "Novelle" is suggested by his famous justification ofthe "ideal" or "poetic" ending of the piece to Eckermann: Denn was soil das Reale an sich? Wir haben Freude daran, wenn es mit Wahrheit dargestellt ist, ja es kann uns von gewissen Dingen eine deutlichere Erkenntnis geben; aber der eigentliche Gewinn fur unsere hohere Natur liegt doch allein im Idealen, das aus dem Herzen des Dichters hervorging.3 Despite the thirty years that separate this remark from Goethe's initial conception and from his ruminations on the hierarchy of genres, the vocabulary reflects the same thought patterns at work: on the one hand the potential dialectic originating in the dichotomy of real and ideal, on the other hand the neoclassical progression implicit in the phrase "der eigentliche Gewinn fur unsere hohere Natur." This essay will demonstrate the way in which the "Novelle" embodies and is determined by the transformation of the progressive structure into the dialectical one, or of the neoclassical into the Romantic. I will begin by defining the differences between the "real" and "ideal" as they appear in the terms ofthe "Novelle." The central parts ofthe essay will discuss the role ofthe traditional hierarchy of genres in the "Novelle," and then the implicit critique of the hierarchy which appears in a com plex expose of overly subjective vision. The last section discusses the resolution of this tension in the "ideal" conclusion ofthe work. I The world of the "Novelle" readily divides into lower and higher settings. Below is the new castle and the realm of prose, above is the old ruin and the region of poetry.4 The lower realm is human, charac terized by crowding (the market) and violence (the hunt, the fire), while the upper realm of nature remains peaceful. Below we find unresolved passions, above accommodation and self-control. Between these two realms lies the stony area where the confrontation with the tiger takes place. The stony land is a barrier which certain characters, like the ruling family, cannot cross; at the same time it is the place where the major shift, the decision not to kill the lion, takes place. There are important structural differences in the presentation of the 3. 18 January 1827. 4. Goethe himself makes this distinction in conversation with Eckermann, 18 January 1827, when he says that to follow the other figures back to the city would make the end prosaic.</page><page sequence="3">DIALECTICS OF ART IN GOETHE'S "NOVELLE" 219 upper and lower realms. The opening hunt scene is striking for its fragmentation. The thick fog which swathes the scene allows the ob server only partial views of isolated details. The constant reversals of direction ("hie und da," "den Zuruckhaltenden . . . fortzuschleppen," "verlangerte . . . verkurzte") and the long sentences with their lists and self-interruptions generate stylistic disorientation and disconnectedness. To the extent that there is motion in the opening paragraph, it too is discontinuous?either it appears to be self-negating, as in the lengthening and shortening of the stirrups, or it leads nowhere (the paragraph ends with "zauderte"). This "discontinuous" style is important, for separations of various kinds play a major role in the real, prosaic realm. The central motif of the opening tableau introduces the most important separation in the "Novelle," since hunting is seen as a disruption of the relationship between man and nature. The impact of the hunt is described as follows: "man hatte sich vorgenommen, weit in das Gebirg hineinzudringen, um die friedlichen Bewohner der dortigen Walder durch einen unerwarteten Kriegszug zu beunruhigen."5 The central animal in this first tableau is the horse, which the lion's owner later portrays as wild and destructive. The final "ideal" tableau obviously reverses the fragmentation of the opening. The forest around the ruined castle is a place where no ax (i.e. no weapon) has sounded for a hundred and fifty years. The central animal?the lion now?is seen as the peaceful regent and friend of man: there is a harmonious relationship between man and nature. While the opening tableau was exclusively visual, the end integrates visual and aural elements as well. The description, too, is continuous. Static de scriptive details are subsumed into a clear temporal sequence. Even after the child and the lion sit transfigured, lit up by the last rays of the sun, the action proceeds and the child continues his ever changing song. II Visual elements dominate the structure of the "Novelle." The conver sations with Eckermann keep reverting to the pictorial qualities of the "Novelle" with terms like "Verteilung von Licht und Schatten," "Bild," "genaue Zeichnung," "wie ein Maler," and "Landschaftszeichnen."6 In this respect it appears to be squarely located in the neoclassical tradition.7 5.

BROWN Both the beginning and the end are presented as tableaux; these are in turn connected by a whole series of similar scenes in which motion is temporarily suspended. The series of pictures created by the "Novelle" exactly follows the canonical progression up the hierarchy of genres. We may best take our description of the hierarchy from Meyer's "Uber die Gegenstande der bildenden Kunst." Meyer lists the suitable subjects for painting begin ning with "rein menschliche Handlungen." From here he proceeds up ward to "Historische Darstellungen," then to "Charakterbilder," then to mythical and allegorical (i.e. emblematic) pictures, and finally to "symbolische Darstellungen," by which he seems to mean representa tions of divinity. These subjects are increasingly suitable for great art and are all subsumed under what Goethe calls the "ideal genre" in his own sketch, "Uber die Gegenstande der bildenden Kunst." Then Meyer returns to his starting point and moves downwards. Just below strictly human actions in suitability come animal pictures, then a host of so called "indifferent" subjects, which include processions, banquet scenes, portraits that do not idealize their subjects (as opposed to "Charakter bilder"), landscapes, and still lifes. Goethe calls this last group of subjects "natural." Goethe's tableaux correspond remarkably closely to Meyer's elabo ration of this schema. The first tableau of the hunt, with its lack of a unifying central occurrence, is clearly what Meyer would call an indif ferent subject like the processions or banquets that he mentions. Meyer elaborates on the best way to deal with such indifferent subjects: "Fey erliche Aufziige, Marsche, Triumphe und dergleichen, die viele Breite erfordern, werden sich am besten fur ein Fries in Basrelief gearbeitet, oder grau in grau gemahlt, schicken."8 The fog that swathes the opening scene corresponds to the "grau in grau" effect which Meyer calls for. The drawings of the ruin are landscapes, the next step up; the pictures of the lion and tiger, animal pictures, complete the "natural" half of the hierarchy. The ideal half begins with the description of the fire; Meyer's example of a "rein menschliche Handlung" is Raphael's "Incendio di Borgo," which he describes as "die allgemeine Vorstellung von einer bei Nacht ausbrechenden Feuersbrunst."9 The boundary between "rein menschliche Handlung" and "historische Darstellung" (by which he means a scene from a story) is left unclear in Meyer's essay; the same is true in the "Novelle." When Honorio kneels at the feet of the princess we have in one sense a typically human situation. Yet because the figures 8. Die Propylden, Vol. i, no. 2 (1799), 56. 9. Die Propylden, Vol. 1, no. 1 (1798), 25.</page><page sequence="5">DIALECTICS OF ART IN GOETHE'S "NOVELLE" 221 are part of a particular story the scene is also historical in Meyer's sense. The gathering of the larger group around the father and boy with the flute partakes of the same ambiguity, although here, because it must so clearly be part of a story, the tableau is more heavily historical. The transfigured Honorio gazing into the sunset is a "Charakterbild," a portrait which has some significance beyond looking like its subject. The child seated in the sun with the lion, is, finally, an allegory. Meyer's example of a good allegory is Amor dressed as Hercules; its message is "Die Liebe besiegt auch die St'arksten." Once again, Goethe's summary of the theme of the narrative "wie das Unbandige . . . durch Liebe . . . bezwungen werde," is remarkably similar to Meyer's example.10 The "Novelle" thus embodies the neoclassical tendency to idealize perception in its reconstruction ofthe hierarchy of genres. Such ideali zation is positive, of course, provided it remains within bounds and does not exclude the real; for in his own sketch on the hierarchy of genres Goethe requires that the ideal also subsume the real.11 As we shall now see, the "Novelle" also asserts the importance ofthe real (or the natural) by thematizing the dangers of the idealizing function run wild, where characters substitute pre-formed images or personal inner vision for external reality. Ill Goethe was notoriously hostile to aids to vision?"Sowie ein Fremder mit der Brille auf der Nase zu mir hereintritt, kommt sogleich eine Verstimmung uber mich," he remarks to Eckermann in one notorious utterance.12 The telescope in the "Novelle" would be, then, a likely place to begin looking for a critique of vision. The first view through the telescope, the evening view of the ruin, is described as if it were a unity?"Ruinen . . &lt;. , die in der Abendbeleuchtung merkwiirdig her vortraten, indem die grossten Licht- und Schattenmassen den deutlich sten Begriff von einem so ansehnlichen Denkmal alter Zeit verleihen io. In conversation with Eckermann, 18 January 1827. Ernst Beutler argues that this tableau is based on the frontespiece of F. C. L. von Moser's Daniel in der Lbwengrube ("Ursprung und Gehalt von Goethes 'Novelle,'" Deutsche Vierteljahresschrift, 16 [1938], 338); thus even its source is allegorical. 11. This reciprocity of ideal and real corresponds to the reciprocity of artist and world, most recently elaborated by Use Graham in Goethe. Portrait of the Artist (Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 1977), pp. 182-87 and 352-56. 12. In conversation, 5 April 1830. This remark is part of a long diatribe. A somewhat less virulent criticism of telescopes may be found' in Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (see below, note 13). Goethe's use of telescopes and paintings as they are analyzed in this essay corresponds to eighteenth-century usage. See Langen, Anschauungsformen in der deutschen Dichtung des 18. Jahrhunderts, pp. 17 and 28-29.</page><page sequence="6">222 JANE K. BROWN konnten" (p. 492). But when the princess returns to it the next day, the view is different. Now the telescope catches "quite noticeably" ("recht auffallend," p. 492) the fall colors on the trees in and around the ruin. Although the view of the previous evening seemed to give the clearest possible picture of the ruin, it now develops that the telescope can be an instrument of distortion. By showing the leaves exceptionally clearly it distracts from the complete view and shows only a part of the landscape. The words "Ansicht" and "Uberblick," which appear so often in the story, do not refer to the views through the telescope.13 This capacity for distortion is exploited by the princess and Honorio: for them the telescope becomes a means to focus exclusively on their own desires. The princess turns it from the world of nature to the object of her passion when she turns it away from the rich natural scene on which it had been focused to the bare, stony place and seeks to pick her husband out of the landscape. The passage in which Honorio looks through the telescope fits the same pattern: in the midst of the magnif icent view of the whole countryside from the top of the hill, he looks through the telescope at the booths in the crowded marketplace, thus separating the human world from the landscape. Honorio looks down ward into the swarming market, the human world from which the wild beasts and fire will break out. Indeed, it is through the telescope that he first sees the dangerous fire, which symbolizes his passion for the prin cess.14 For both Honorio and the princess, then, the telescope functions as a way to restrict perception to what their hearts want to see. The princess's reactions to the sketches of the ruin take us one step further?to a denial of perception. Uncle Friedrich shows her sketches 13- The telescope leads to similar dangers in the Wanderjahre. In the first version Wilhelm almost tumbles over a precipice when he thinks his telescope shows him Natalie waving to him (Propylden Ausgabe von Goethes Sdmtlichen Werken, xxxiv [Berlin: Propyl'aen, n.d.], 116-17). ^ retains its negative value in the final version, although this particular scene is deleted. In Part 1, chapter 10 Wilhelm says that "diese Mittel, wodurch wir unsern Sinnen zu Hulfe kommen, keine sittlich giinstige Wirkung auf den Menschen ausuben . . . es gehort eine hohere Kultur dazu, deren nur vorzugliche Menschen fahig sind, ihr Inneres, Wahres mit diesem von aussen herangeriickten Falschen einigermassen auszugleichen." (Hamburger Ausgabe, vm [Hamburg: Wegner, 1964], 120-21). Wilhelm does not consider himself one of those "vorzugliche Menschen." The problem lies not so much in the telescope, as in failure to be aware of the special conditions it imposes. E. W'asche's assertion that the princess is one of those rare people who can do so is evidently unfounded (Honorio und der Lowe [Sackingen: Stratz, 1947], p. 32). 14. Cf. Goethe's earlier use ofthe identical image in Die Geschwister to express Mar ianne's passionate love for Wilhelm: "Es ist mir wie neulich, da es auf dem Markt brannte und erst Rauch und Dampf uber alles zog, bis auf einmal das Feuer das Dach hob und das ganze Haus in einer Flamme stand" (Hamburger Ausgabe, iv [Hamburg: Wegner, 1965], 366).</page><page sequence="7">DIALECTICS OF ART IN GOETHE'S "NOVELLE" 223 of the ruin not as it is, but as it will look when he has carried out his plans to harmonize the human and natural aspects of the old castle. Curiously, the princess finds the sketches both improbable and unhelp ful: "[ich] werde jetzt erst recht verlangend, mit Augen zu sehen, was mir in der Erzahlung unmoglich schien und in der Nachbildung un wahrscheinlich bleibt" (p. 495). She finds them improbable because she wants to obtain the same concrete information from them as from reality. But probability is not the appropriate category for these sketches, which purposely idealize the ruin. In failing to recognize the idealizing component of the sketches placed there by the artist, she in effect rejects them. She substitutes her assumption of what the drawings ought to show for what they actually show. Ultimately she tries to project her own image of things onto all concrete reality. When the fire breaks out, the princess's memory of the fire Friedrich experienced takes the place of the actual fire, described, significantly, as "Schreckfc/Mer" (p. 500?emphasis mine). An inner im age has substituted itself for the experience at hand. In the confrontation with the tiger the princess also no longer "sees" the real tiger at all. Instead she responds to a projected vision of a dangerous hunter, which she has appropriated from the advertisement in the market?even though Friedrich had explicitly pointed out the difference between the real animal and the lurid picture when the two of them crossed the market place earlier.15 Honorio, too, projects his inner vision onto the tiger. The animal does not attack the princess of his own accord, but is driven up the slope by the eager page: Honorio forces him to appear dangerous by thinking he is dangerous?indeed by wanting him to be dangerous, so that he can rescue the beloved mistress. Here even more than in the case of the telescope we see private passions usurping the objectivity of vision. The tendency of these two figures to displace reality with their own "idealizations" also shows in Goethe's treatment of their unaided vision. The first time that she uses the telescope the princess focuses with her "glanzende Augen" (p. 492) upon the bare stony place where she hopes to find her husband. The phrase "glanzende Augen," with its suggestion that the light shines from the eye onto the landscape, emphasizes to what extent the princess imposes her vision upon the landscape, for the light from her eyes contrasts strongly with the deadness of the landscape she looks at.16 The "glanzend befriedigten Augen" (p. 511) of the child 15- The language ofthe passage emphasizes this substitution: "heranspringend, wie sie ihn vor Kurzem gemalt gesehen, kam der Tiger entgegen, und dieses Bild machte den wundersamsten Eindruck" (p. 502?emphasis mine). 16. Before the description of the fire was moved to its present position, the princess</page><page sequence="8">224 JANE K. BROWN at the end, by contrast, answer to the brightness in the setting?the autumn colors and the transfiguring sunlight?which fill the scene in the courtyard. How personal the perception of the princess must be is suggested by her refusal to believe in the harmonious world of the ruin until she sees it with her own eyes. There is a kind of hubris in her rejection of anyone else's point of view. In the same passage she asso ciates seeing with personal pleasure?"ich habe grosse Lust, mich heute weit in der Welt umzusehen" (p. 495)?and in her enthusiastic descrip tion of the market we see how readily her vision slips into imagination: "denn hier sieht der aufmerksame Beobachter alles, was der Mensch leistet und bedarf; man bildet sich einen Augenblick ein, ..." (p. 495? emphasis mine). As in her use of the pictures and the telescope, the princess's eyes are more responsive to what is within than without: again, after Honorio has sighted the fire, she is overwhelmed by mem ories of Friedrich's stories and, we are told, "nun schien der heitere morgendliche Gesichtskreis umnebelt, ihre Augen verdiistert" (p. 501). Thus the memory, the inner image, closes her eyes to what she should see ("Gesichtskreis"). The extreme subjectivity of her vision separates her from the serene natural world around her?and she is unable to penetrate the harmonious world beyond the stony no-man's land. Total dependence on projection from within thus results in discontinuity.17 Honorio's vision is equally subjective. He sees the tiger skin only as an object of pleasure for the princess: "ich blicke dieses Fell nur an, wie es euch zur Lust begleiten kann" (p. 503?emphasis mine). We observe here the same formulation subliminally relating his private vision to pleasure as in the princess's "Lust" to see the world earlier. Honorio further presents the hide as a triumphal sign, "zur Schau getragen," to celebrate the successful hunt. Once again Honorio tries to impose his inner view onto the real situation. The significance of this motif is was supposed to associate the animals with the fire when she passed their cages; this was to be expressed in language parallel to what we have just seen: "und es ist keine Frage dass ein feuriges Auge sich die Gegenstande zum Schein entziinden und als flammend vor sich schauen kann." (Weimarer Ausgabe I. Abt., xvn, 468?emphasis mine). The reflexive construction emphasizes that the eye is not open to outer impressions, but projects an inner vision. 17. Friedrich has also been doomed to isolation by his eyes. The fire he experienced has become an idee fixe which makes him a tiresome companion and which pulls him down from the enjoyment of the view from the mountain. What is interesting for us here is that he remembers this fire in visual terms, "in die Augen eingebrannt" (p. 496). Friedrich's efforts to make the ruin accessible may be seen as an attempt to efface this scar, to go beyond his permanent vision of fire, but at best we are shown only a premonition of this achievement. The fact is that, like the princess, Friedrich is never shown to us at the ruin; he, too, must yield to the child with the flute.</page><page sequence="9">DIALECTICS OF ART IN GOETHE'S "NOVELLE" 225 emphasized when the watchman regrets his lost opportunity to show off the lion's hide and thus to use it as a vehicle to impose himself upon the world. But here the display of the tiger hide is to show Honorio's love for the princess as well as his victory over the beast. Thus once again this overly subjective vision is tied both to a violent, discontinuous relationship to nature, and to assertive passion as the specific example of this relationship.18 What then are the alternatives that lead to the continuity of the end? Let us examine the "purifications" ofthe princess and Honorio and see. We last see Honorio sitting on a wall at the approach to the old ruin? "er sass wie in tiefen Gedanken versunken, er sah umher wie zerstreut" (p. 510). For the first time we do not see him looking purposefully; instead a less assertive mode of perception is at work. This being so, he is open to the blessing of the woman. Then he looks out toward the setting sun: his vision has broadened to compass the absolute, he no longer looks downward and inward. And now the woman tells him he will succeed. Honorio's conquest of his passion and of himself is ex pressed in a broadening of his perception (through looking out and listening to the woman), and the fire of passion is now transfigured in the red sunlight on his face. The departure of the princess is less glorious, but nonetheless signif icant. We last see her in the group around the dead tiger. Together with the others she listens to the man's sermon on the glories of nature, which until now she has rejected for a strictly personal perspective. Then, with the rest, she falls under the spell of the magic flute. As the music ends she takes out her handkerchief and covers her eyes. In response to the words, the music and the atmosphere of total peace they evoke she renounces with this action her allegiance to her own vision above all else and, in turning to the prince for protection, her previous assertiveness as well. The continuities of the final scene present us ultimately with an inte gration of the senses such as the princess has not yet achieved. There is not only the tableau of the child seated with the lion in the best light, but there is also the music ofthe flute and song, the poem.19 There is not only an integration of the arts corresponding to this integration of the senses, but an integration in time as well, to overcome the gap 18. It is also a fine narrative irony that this discontinuous relationship is presented discontinuously. Because his love is never made explicit there is a literal discontinuity between what is said and what is meant. 19. On the general importance of music as reconciliation in Goethe, see E. M. Wil kinson, Goethes Trilogie der Leidenschaft. Als Beitrag zur Frage der Katharsis. Vortag (Frank furt: Frankfurter Goethemuseum, Freies Deutsches Hochstift, 1957).</page><page sequence="10">226 JANE K. BROWN between the past of the ruin and the present of the new castle and the market. This integration manifests itself in the constant readjustments of the poem and the equivalent constant changes in the child-lion myth without significant outward activity. As the "Beschwichtiger" the child is replaying the famous scene from Mozart's Zauberflote (indeed, the word Zauber is gratuitously thrown into the paragraph which begins "Der Knabe schien seine Flote versuchen zu wollen" [p. 506]) and also Tieck's high-spirited parody of the same scene in Der gestiefelte Kater, where there is an official "Besanftiger." When the child disappears into the cavern in search of the lion we are clearly to think of the trials by fire and water from Mozart's work, where the protagonists also disap pear into a cavern. The first stanza of the song shifts the reference to Daniel in the lion's den; the removal of the thorn from the lion's foot shifts it once again to the story of Androcles and the lion. When the child wraps the lion's paw in his handkerchief the reference shifts finally to the "Novelle" itself, for this action repeats that of the princess when she covers her eyes. In this self-reflection, the "Novelle" unmasks itself as art, as a show. Indeed, the setting at the end is explicitly described as "Arena des Schauspiels" (p. 511); the various allusions in this scene are all spectacles which take place in theaters or arenas. With this final shift the narrative achieves the ultimate integration and closure of the poem, which is a series of variations on itself. We have passed from lion as picture to lion as myth, literature, opera, and from pictorial narrative to narrative encompassing all of the arts. Subjective vision has been chas tened and integrated into a larger perceptual context. And this means, we are told in the explicit political language of the end, the tyrant is tamed. IV The process of the "Novelle," then, is to move toward broadening and chastening of such subjective perception through integration of a variety of perspectives, to progress from the exclusively pictorial to the literary. And this progression involves the restriction of inner vision. Yet at the same time the "Novelle" progresses up the hierarchy of genres, from real to ideal. And this progression (toward idealization) is an intensifi cation of inner vision. Goethe's use of the eighteenth-century hierarchy thus both transcends it and undercuts it simultaneously, for integration is an implicit rejection of hierarchy, which depends on separation and distinction. The "Novelle" thus moves in a spiral?the typical Goethean dialectic?leading to a higher kind of subjective vision through an order based on balanced integration?that is, to idealization. Goethe makes this dialectic viable through narrative irony which reinforces the central</page><page sequence="11">DIALECTICS OF ART IN GOETHE'S "NOVELLE" 227 theme ofthe "Novelle" that no one perspective is definitive. This irony is best observed first in the case of the princess, then with respect to the so-called "natural" family. In our view ofthe princess we have encountered an apparent conflict. Although it is the princess, above all, whose subjective vision is tamed, nevertheless the narrator has been at some pains to let us know that she is unusually attractive, pleasant and intelligent (pp. 496, 497). It develops that this attitude is as much tact on the part of the narrator as anything else, for he, apparently, like the local inhabitants, considers it appropriate that "die erste Frau im Lande auch die schonste und anmutigste sei" (p. 497). It is, so to speak, his responsibility to give the reader a beautiful picture of the princess. It is, however, equally our responsibility not to limit our perception to the possibly over-idealized picture, but to re spond to what the princess says and does, not just to what the narrator says about her. Thus when the narrator reports "die schone Liebens wiirdige erheiterte jeden Aufenthalt durch eine geistreiche Bemerkung" (p. 496), we must be prepared to realize that her remark is not especially clever, and that her later "Betrachtung" about the peacefulness of nature is not only positively banal, but wrong as well in the context. Thus we are forced to broaden our perception of the central figure beyond the picture fed us by the narrator, just as the figures in the novella must do in order to reach the continuous world of the ruin. The continuity of this world is thus seen to be not simply a statement about man and nature in general, but about man's perception of himself and of nature. The implicit perspectives, or ironies as we might call them, with regard to the family are more complex. The family is "natural" (and somewhat Biblical as Staiger and most recently Herman Meyer have argued at some length).20 But their naturalness is really mediated and indeed recognizably artificial. The elegy of the mother over the dead tiger is Ossianic.21 As Ossian is an artificial, a "stage" primitivism, so, 20. E. Staiger, Goethe, in (Zurich: Atlantis, 1963), 190 ff. and H. Meyer, Naturlicher Enthusiasmus: Das Morgenlandische in Goethes Novelle (Heidelberg: Lothar Stiehm, 1973), passim. 21. It is not, as Herman Meyer argues (Naturlicher Enthusiasmus, p. 24), a pastiche of two elegies from Herder's Volkslieder. The participial and infinitive constructions clearly distinguish Goethe's elegy from its putative sources, but are to be found repeatedly in Goethe's translations from Ossian in Werther. Furthermore, in the supposed sources in Herder, the rhetorical questions are all answered, whereas in Goethe's elegy, as in Ossian, they are necessarily unanswerable. Meyer's argument, which locates the "Novelle" in the context of Goethe's relationship to Herder and his interest in the Bible, is basically correct; but it is not sufficiently precise. The two elegies which Meyer offers as sources are, after all, cited in Herder's essay on Ossian. In any case Macpherson's idea of primitive language is evidently modeled partly on Biblical language; Herder certainly classed the two together,</page><page sequence="12">228 JANE K. BROWN too, there is something slightly "stagey" about the family. They adver tise their animals with misleading pictures, they dress in an unusual, especially showy way, they express themselves in a language apart from that of ordinary conversation. As we have already seen, the final taming of the lion is presented as a spectacle, and we must remember further that it is truly a show, for the lion is a tame one from the very beginning. The tiger's ferocious chase after the princess is also a "show," for it is driven by Honorio and in any case, it had no strength in its claws. Goethe carefully leaves a few holes in the "natural" facade ofthe family so that it, too, is seen to be an "image," a limited perspective. The speeches ofthe parents are also not entirely "natural." The un expectedly formal close of the mother's lament?"wie lange war uns deine Gesellschaft wichtig und fruchtbar!" (p. 505)?undercuts the "nat ural" effect of her love for the animal by revealing its economic impor tance to her.22 The "sermon" ofthe husband betrays a similar inconsis tency. His language derives basically from the praise of God in Job, as Herman Meyer has shown.23 Yet it is subtly trivialized. For example, the passage "denn der Herr hat das Ross zum Gesellen des Windes gemacht und zum Gefahrten des Sturms, dass es den Mann dahin trage, wohin er will, und die Frau wohin sie begehrt" (p. 508) reminds us of the description ofthe fierceness ofthe war horse in Job. But consider the discrepancy between the two halves of the sentence: God has created the horse as companion ofthe wind, but to what purpose? to follow the bidding of man, and of woman as well. Further, we cannot overlook for he uses examples from Ossian to illustrate and evoke the spirit of Genesis in his Fragmente zu einer Archeologie des Morgenlandes (Samtliche Werke, ed. B. Suphan, iv [Berlin: Weidmann, 1877-1913], 21), and in Vom Geist der Ebraischen Poesie he introduces Ossian to defend the frequent use of personification in the Bible, saying "Ossian ist in Personi fication Hiobs Bruder" (Samtliche Werke, ed. B. Suphan, xi, 297). S. Wukadinovic argues that the elegy of the woman is based on the language of the Indians in the novels of James Fenimore Cooper, which Goethe was reading just before and during the time he was writing the "Novelle" (Goethes "Novelle." Der Schauplatz?Coopersche Einfliisse [Halle: Niemeyer, 1909], pp. 96-97). It is probably no coincidence, however, that Cooper's Indians, especially in the long elegy for Uncas at the end ofThe Last of the Mohicans, sound distinctly Ossianic. Whether or not Cooper may have modeled his idea of primitive language on Ossian, Herder had long since noted the similarity between American Indian poetry and Ossian ("Uber Ossian," Samtliche Werke, ed. B. Suphan, v, 166), and the passages would certainly have sounded Ossianic to Goethe. 22. Cf. M. Swales's argument that by making their living from the animals the family is contaminated by the tendency to violence which characterizes all of the other people in the story ("The Threatened Society. Some Remarks on Goethe's 'Novella,'" PEGS, NS 38 [1968], 43-68). His argument is correct, but I am concerned here not with the psy chology of the characters but with the recognition that they are playing roles. 23.

The various precedents for the taming of the lion at the end, since they are all literary precedents, counteract the supposed "naturalness" of the event on yet another level. In addition to the three obvious references in the scene discussed above, there is another less obvious one, which nevertheless goes to the heart of the problem of the rela tionship of nature to art. We know that Goethe was reading The Last of the Mohicans with intense interest just when he began work on the "Novelle" in the fall of 1826. The comic relief character in this novel is a grotesque Yankee music teacher named David Gamut (a reference to the Biblical singer) who stumbles along after Leatherstocking and the Indians, armed only with his pitch-pipe. In moments of danger he sings abominable psalm paraphrases to calm the savages of the forest; he escapes unscathed and unscalped not because his music is soothing, but because the Indians respect his apparent insanity. Nevertheless he himself is deeply moved by the funeral dirges of the Indians after the death of Uncas. In David's first speech he quotes the passage about the majesty ofthe horse from Job that is alluded to and trivialized in the sermon of the father in the "Novelle." Furthermore, David's clothing is the "Werther uniform," blue coat and yellow knee pants. This figure would seem likely, then, to have attracted Goethe's special interest. Although Goethe had doubtless already conceived the end of the "Novelle" in general terms by the time he read The Last ofthe Mohicans, the ultimate complexity of the art-nature dichotomy may well owe something to Cooper. In addition to his comic functions, David is a focal point for the ambiguous relationship between the natural world of the Indians in the forest and civilized world of the European invaders, English and French alike. On the surface there appear to be the same oppositions as in the "Novelle": the "civilized" whites impose their passions and quarrels upon the unspoiled natural world. Yet the un 24. Meyer points out that except for this passage the sermon is in keeping with Goethe's opposition to any superficial teleological explanations of natural phenomena. He tries to explain the contradiction away: "Hier scheint das Tier nun eben nicht 'Zweck sein selbst' zu sein. Aber es ist zu bedenken, dass Goethe liberal genug war, der im Rahmen des tatigen Lebens unvermeidlichen utilistischen Teleologie ein beschranktes Recht zu gewah ren ... sie bekommt sogar eine ganz eigene Weihe uber alien Utilismus hinaus durch den Glanz, der gerade hier besonders hell aus der Gottesrede im Buch Hiob uberstrahlt" (Naturlicher Enthusiasmus, p. 63). It is always unpleasant to have to explain away incon sistencies, but this one is evidently deliberate.</page><page sequence="14">230 JANE K. BROWN spoiled natural world in Cooper is itself a violent place, for the feud between the rival Indian tribes long antedates the war between the English and French. This ambiguity is typical of the effect of David's singing: there are times when it soothes its white hearers, times when it soothes the Indians, times when it has no effect at all. And, finally, the Indian funeral dirge has the strongest effect of any music in the book: the savage tames the civilized man with his music. This same reversal takes place, in effect, in the "Novelle," when the "natural" boy calms the "civilized" hunting party and converts the princess. If the boy acts here as the "natural" taming the "civilized," how are we to label his role when he tames the lion, officially a repre sentative of the natural rather than the civilized world? Properly speak ing, no taming takes place in the final scene, for the lion is long since domesticated, and apparently not even especially in need of calming, for he lies stretched out in the sun. The end really presents a masque of the taming of the lion, in which the boy and the lion both play roles. It is the people?in particular Honorio and the princess?who are really tamed in the story, just as in Cooper's novel David is finally overcome by the Indian music. The anthropomorphic political language of the closing is another example of the narrator's ironic tact; as in the case of the pictures and the tiger, the violence and passions of the humans are projected onto the animals: the human realm is treated with the same misleading courtesy as the princess.25 One other aspect of Cooper's novel is interesting for us here. David Gamut is not really a creation of Cooper's. He is borrowed essentially complete except for his clothing from Washington Irving's "Legend of Sleepy Hollow," where he is better known to us as Ichabod Crane. Whereas Ichabod Crane is strictly a static humor character, Cooper uses David Gamut to deal with a major theme and gradually transforms him into a serious character, so that by the end he fights in the company of the heroic figures. Thus to the extent that Goethe's flute player reminds us of David Gamut, we are dealing with an imitation of an imitation; the reference thus reminds us of the artificiality of the situation in a doubly intensified manner. In the multiple ironies of the finale Goethe reveals the nature of the integration of real and ideal as spectacle or "play." Indeed, despite terminological differences, the dialectic of the "Novelle" is really Schil lerian.26 The entry of the category of play from Schiller's Asthetische 2$. Cf. M. Swales's argument in "The Threatened Society" that the society is tempo rarily purged of its violence. It is important, however, to be aware ofthe narrator's ironic tact, which ultimately suggests that the reader, too, is to be tamed by the final spectacle. 26. Goethe uses "ideal" to mean both the absolute and its synthesis with reality?or, as</page><page sequence="15">DIALECTICS OF ART IN GOETHE'S "NOVELLE" 231 Briefe is anything but coincidental, for the work originated during the period of Goethe's most intense interaction with Schiller. The under lying issue ofthe "Novelle" is thus the transformation ofthe neoclassical hierarchical organization into a Schillerian dialectic. This is the signifi cance of the discrepancy between Meyer's progressive and Goethe's dualistic descriptions of the hierarchy of genres we saw at the outset. Whatever other importance we may attribute to the "Novelle" as a major example of Goethe's late style, it must nevertheless also be under stood in the context ofthe 1790's. In this respect it documents?rather unexpectedly?the impact of the Kantian revolution on the eighteenth century. University of Virginia it was formulated earlier, Goethe's ideal both opposes and subsumes the real. Schiller uses "ideal" to mean only the opposition to the real; their synthesis is beauty in his system. Nevertheless, the essential structure is the same.</page></plain_text>
