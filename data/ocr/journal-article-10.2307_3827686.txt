In light of his em- phasis upon Edward's death and the elements of myth in the lovers' portrayal of Mr. Barrett, though, Karlin seems mistaken in downplaying Elizabeth's income, which exceeded that of Browning's father, as a source of family tension. And given the Bar- retts' somewhat reduced circumstances, Elizabeth's proposed trip to Pisa for her health in 1845, which was to include her sister Arabella and her brother George, might well have seemed to Mr. Barrett a threat to both his authority and the household economy. Although Elizabeth was not fully aware of her financial independence until near the end of her courtship, her wealth had already conferred upon her a special status within her family and a freedom of choice regarding where to live and whether to marry. Karlin focuses almost exclusively on the letters and subordinates poetic matters to biographical psy- chology. He underestimates Elizabeth's poetry and criticism as well as Robert's need and desire for an able, sympathetic critic. He makes sparing use and offers little analysis of Sonnets from the Portuguese and is too dismissive of Elizabeth's comments on Robert's poetry, considering only those on "The Flight of the Duchess." Karlin nonetheless makes a signal contribution in considering the letters as conscious literary and rhetorical productions. His engaging and suggestive analysis gives us a bet- ter appreciation of the great Victorian literary monument that the love letters of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning are. Both Paul E. Coggins's and Loy D. Martin's books share a debilitating allergy to history, despite their disparity in critical sophistication. The themes suggested by the title of Coggins's Egoism versus Al- truism in Browning's Dramas could have served as a basis for synthesizing the scholarship on Browning's comedies and tragedies of liberal sentiment and for considering them in terms of the history of early Victorian drama. But these issues give rise only to Coggins's plot summaries and enthusiastic impres- sionism. Martin's Browning's Dramatic Monologues and the Post-Romantic Subject is a thorny hothouse hybrid of Althusserian Marxism and Lacanian psy- choanalysis, with grafts from sociolinguistic conver- sational analysis and Gregory Bateson's notions about cybernetic systems, that produces little inter- pretive fruit. Since Martin does not so much present as presuppose a Marxist interpretation of Browning and since he gradually abandons the militant termi- nology of "post-Romantic" for "Victorian" and "subject" for "self," readers wanting the latest Marxist thinking on Victorian literature should consult Fredric Jameson's Political Unconscious (1981). Martin's thesis is that Browning's dramatic mon- ologue is a formal device which isolates the ideology of the autonomous bourgeois self in order to reveal through irony the selfs internal contradictions and to point to a communal solidarity inherent in lan- guage. Now Browning does intend to undermine the autonomous self, but does so to develop the Christian soul. And Martin's idea that Browning believes in a secular community created by language is wishful post-modernist thinking. For Abt Vogler and Browning, one has "On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round." The theoreti- cal difficulty comes from Martin's having repressed Browning's belief in a transcendent God, a repres- sion which returns bizarrely in his discussion of the tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous in his personal ep- ilogue. This problem extends to his central and pro- vocative reading of "Pictor Ignotus" in connection with the parable of the talents. Martin suggests that the painter's failure results from a psychological split created by the market system. But just as he never had to work for a living, Browning never makes the financial conversion from spiritual concerns about salvation: the painter's fear of spiritual corruption stemming from popular success ironically creates an equally dangerous spiritual pride that prevents him from expressing artistically his love for God. Martin does offer interesting discussions of rhetorical and syntactic patterns that establish context in the dra- matic monologue (the use of demonstrative pro- nouns, progressive tenses, questions, and adverbs of time), though he falls victim to a vicious linguistic jargon and mistakes his analysis of these aspects for a constitutive theory of the dramatic monologue it- self. He is good when talking about monologues as moments of fragmentary process, but disappointing in historical and theoretical discussion. Martin's book is a curiosity shop in the theoretical bazaar of the 1970s and an unintentional commentary on the shortening half-lives of the intellectual goods to be found there.

Huxley fondly reminisced in 1882, "without being VICTORIAN STUDIES</page><page sequence="2">291 reminded of Socrates" ("Charles Darwin," Darwi- niana, 1894, p. 246). Noting the success achieved by the twenty-three year old Origin, Huxley re- marked on his own astonishment at "the extraordi- nary manifestation of affectionate regard for the man, and of profound reverence for the philoso- pher," the late Charles Darwin (p. 244). Huxley's remark was less pertinent in 1882 than prescient of 1982. Profound reverence for Darwin as a philoso- pher had to wait for expression until the recent cen- tennial commemoration of his death, when Darwin industrialists met in 1982 at the Villa di Mondeggi, near Florence, to establish the Darwinian heritage. Between 1882 and 1982, two other memorial occasions commanded notice. In the 1909 centen- nial celebration of Darwin's birth, the man himself received tribute as a major scientist and a glance of recognition as a philosopher of modest talent. His major scientific theory stood in England only as the first among contenders, elsewhere not even that. The 1959 centennial celebration of the Origin's birth focused, as did that of 1909, upon substantive rather than methodological aspects of the Darwin- ian heritage. For decades, scientists had eagerly aligned new views in genetics with natural selection into a great synthesis bolstering Darwin's major the- ory. Complementary historiographic investigation tracked precursors of Darwinism, Darwinism as a product of its Victorian matrix, and Darwinism as exerting an influence deeper and broader than any other scientific theory. As indicated in three of the four headings of The Darwinian Heritage - "Darwin in Victorian Context," "Towards the Comparative Reception of Darwinism," and "Perspectives on Darwin and Darwinism" - earlier approaches continue to characterize Darwinian studies. Readers familiar with these studies will be at home with discussions of Victorian capitalism as an ingredient of Social Darwinism and with Scottish political economists, English philosophers of science, and internal and external receptions of Darwin's books. The collec- tion's attitudes towards these and other issues are not coercively monolithic; contributors frequently argue with each other about whether natural selec- tion was in the air or not; whether natural selection confirmed or refuted natural theology; whether the social milieu is irrelevant, contextual, or constitu- tive in Darwin studies; and whether the Victorian scientific community tended more to reject or re- joice in the idea of transmutation of species. Label- ling these as familiar issues does not deny the orginality, vigor, and usefulness of the collection's commentaries upon them. As Darwin himself changed during his life, so Darwinian scholarship changes during its still ener- getic life. Between 1959 and 1982, new biological discoveries, such as that of the double helix, and new biological interpretations, such as that of punc- tuated equilibria, have emerged. But for the young Darwin industry, the most fecund novelty was the publication of Darwin's Notebooks. Before that criti- cal event Darwin's methodology had been, at best, neglected, and at worst, defined as a serendipitous gloss upon Darwin's mania for collecting and itemiz- ing. The Notebooks and other manuscripts unavaila- ble to scholars before 1959 radically altered Darwin studies after that date. Fourteen of the thirty-one essays of The Darwin- ian Heritage, those comprising Part I, specify a new direction in Darwin scholarship: "The Evolution of a Theorist." The redrawn portrait of Darwin no longer depicts a plodder nor even an imaginative speculator who wrote agreeable prose. The Darwin we admired but did not know comes through as an inventor of a new method for research in biological science. Before him, the evolutionary protocol had been dramatic and sensational, as illustrated by Chambers's weird embryology. Darwin designed a program that guided his own geological, cirripedian, anthropological, botanical, and vermicular research and that served as a model for subsequent explora- tions by other biologists for well over a century. The Darwinian Heritage locates the poets, novel- ists, naturalists, and economists that Darwin read; when he hit on his long argument; how words sig- nalling anxiety in the Beagle journals changed to a later diction of confidence; how anthropomorphic and metaphoric language contoured his apprehen- sion of reality; above all, how he assembled data, vagrant hints, and his own impressions into mallea- ble hypotheses, and how he sparked these into a creative solution of the mystery of mysteries. The anthology does more than incorporate scholarship of the past and is more than a compre- hensive monument of present scholarship. It also programs future studies. We learn that the historical agenda requires better identification of pre-Darwinian advocates of descent with modification; of Darwin's relations with specialized scientific and general cul- tural networks; of his interactions with Owen, Hooker, Huxley, Spencer, George Romanes; of sup- port and rebuttal for his theory after his death in England and - at least equally urgent - in Ger- many, France, and Italy. As The Darwinian Heritage itself testifies, prodigious research has been accom- plished on Darwin's early intellectual development leading to the origin of the Origin; his later books WINTER 1987</page><page sequence="3">292 call for equal attention. Parts of the rhetorical agenda are to compare the style of the Origin with that of Natural Selection and to decode Darwin's marginalia. In terms of initiation and schematic fit, what accounts for pangenesis? Of high priority in the agenda is remedying the ignoring and at times thrashing of Darwinism by modem philosophers of science. The post-1982 publication of his letters has be- gun with 338 letters from the years 1821 to 1836. The rest of the 14,000 letters Darwin exchanged with 1,800 correspondents over six decades will, it seems safe to predict, contribute to the direction of future Darwin studies. Publication of his letters might be as important a dividing line in studies after 1982 as was publication of the Notebooks after 1959. The next commemoration will probably be the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth. Between now and then, unknown fossils will be exhumed and un- anticipated modes of understanding evolution and Darwin will be proposed. Then will be 2009, twenty- three years from now. The Darwinian heritage re- mains inexhaustible. CHARLES S. BLINDERMAN Clark University Victorian Women's Fiction: Marriage, Freedom and the Individual, by Shirley Foster; pp. 240.

THESE BOOKS OFFER TWO EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF revisionary work on women writers that is enjoying a great deal of currency of late. So influential is this body of work, it has ceased to behave as a "minor- ity" area of literary studies and begun to determine what issues concern the discipline as a whole. If, as I am assuming, the books under review have taken up central rather than marginal issues in examining women's writing as that of women, it is important to consider how and why they have gone about doing so: Have their approaches to this body of writing done anything to change the way we understand gender? In explaining how women defined them- selves and their work as female, do these critical studies tell us anything we did not already know about British cultural history and women's relation- ship to it? It is my position that if we fail to reexamine gender as the agency and product of cultural history, those of us who deal with women's writing will sim- ply reproduce the cliches which authorize a gender- based model of human identity. I find the two books in question particularly important because they re- veal the potential of literary analysis to convert whatever is theoretically radical in gender studies into something politically conservative. James Kavanagh's reading of Emily Bronte is one of three studies published so far in a series edited by Terry Eagleton. Eagleton intends the books in his series to apply the newest critical approaches to ma- jor authors of British literature. Arguing against a tradition that regards Wuthering Heights as a work of unique and yet timeless meaning, Kavanagh takes up the challenge of describing this novel as the product of its moment in history. He relies at first on Althusserian assumptions to see Wuthering Heights as an "active relation, in which the real and the imaginary constantly overdetermine each other, and through which the subject construes the social real in terms of his or her desire. A complete analy- sis of the complex ideological effects of a literary text like Wuthering Heights, then, must certainly ad- dress the ways in which it revolutionizes, renews and/or restores the subject's imaginary identity, po- sition and possibility within a disrupted sexual and social order" (p. 13). Without half so much talk of critical procedures, Shirley Foster defines a similar goal. She wants to demonstrate how women of the previous century experienced and expressed their sexuality. She, too, takes issue with traditional crit- icism on grounds that it depoliticizes women's fic- tion: "To argue that preoccupation with romantic themes in Victorian women's fiction is either wish- fulfillment or capitulation to publishing convention - or a mixture of both - is not . .. to give the whole picture" (p. 4). Kavanagh may say he is committed to a social- historical approach to Bronte's novel, but his is clearly a notion of history which excludes the woman writer. His reading exhibits a fearful symme- try that one can observe in such chapter titles as "Patriarchal Law and the Anarchy of Desire" and "The Phallic Mother and the Sadism of Control." As Kavanagh translates Bronte's characters into psychoanalytic terms, he steals away Bronte's au- thority over the world of words she authored. All power within the novel becomes phallic, even when Bronte represents that power as female. Nelly Dean is a phallic mother, for example, and defective for lacking the sympathy which Kavanagh thinks women ought to feel. Kavanagh never considers Nelly's as the position of a literate person not of the dominant class who can observe major changes in its dominating strategies. He could have allowed her to provide such a critical perspective on the rad- VICTORIAN STUDIES</page></plain_text>
