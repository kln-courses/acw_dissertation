<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beyond Abstraction Towards Greek Tragedy: Drama, Myth and Society. By Brian Vickers. Longman. $18. Reviewed by David Grene This book is properly called Towards Greek Tragedy. It is not one of those inclusive books on Greek tragedy which treat of every Greek play (usually in a dull synopsis) with partic- ular introductory chapters on each of the three tragedians. This is an argument, with evidence. What Brian Vickers has done is to look at Greek tragedy in the light of what ap- pear to him as basic concepts. These basic concepts are inclusive inside of his scheme, and he gives us a satisfying and coherent ac- count of Greek tragedy which has nothing in О DAVID GRENE is professor of classical litera- ture at the University of Chicago, where he is also with the Committee on Social Thought.

Not that Vickers is short on detail. The book is tremendously long - 658 pages - and when one reexamines it one is impressed how little detailed discussion of anything rele- vant - particular plays, their place in their author's work, themes, and dramatic em- phasis - is omitted. Where there is so much loving care, good taste, imagination, and scholarship it is perhaps ungracious to say that the book is too long. But it is. When Vickers gets to subjects such as the various assumptions about myth, all the way from Fraser and his followers to the merits and defects of modern structuralism, he loses his sense of the argument he is conducting and the chapter becomes too much of a survey of wrong and right views of myth. On the other hand, his section on the relation of Greek so- ciety to myth is masterly. He cuts corners, but with confidence and grace. But the book as a whole, even the brilliant analyses of the Oresteia, Oedipus Rex, and the four Electra plays, would benefit greatly by cutting. Vickers has a number of often new and al- ways fresh and illuminating points to make. He frequently makes them in a few lively and provocative sentences. But one hardly has time to take these in before he is hurrying ahead, drowning his reader in acknowl- edgments of one partial supporter, criticism of an opponent, or quotations from another authority who has summed up another aspect of his own initial statement. It is not that Vickers is repetitious; he is not. But the se- quence and arrangement of his thoughts are less forceful than they should be; there is too much of secondary comment mixed in with primary sources of evidence. In spite of the voluminous footnotes, not enough of the mat- ter proper to them has gone into those foot- notes. And its appearance on the page di- lutes and weakens the fascinating quality of his argument. The book is so good that to make these ob- jections may seem ungenerous. One is im- pelled, however, to object because Vickers 's contributions are of a kind very ill-suited to the excess of particulars and scholarly refer- ences. More than any critic of Greek tragedy that I have read, Vickers cares passionately, simply, and directly about his subject, deeply appreciates it as a kind of theater, and has a proper dislike of anything and anyone who stands between him and it. He will have none of the numerous critics, among them John Jones, who are constantly assuring us that Greek tragedy is so remote that we will do best with it by reminding ourselves that it is nearly impossible to understand. How right Vickers is! He strikes straight at the heart of our own relation to the plays by saying of translation, with all its faults, "The lan- guage of Greek tragedy is the representation of human action and a competent version will reproduce the substance of that action (and even the metaphors which are used to evaluate it) sufficiently for us to be able to en- gage it as a human experience." He pays a most generous tribute to those of us whose translations he has used in his book. He clearly knows about modern performances of Greek plays and appreciates what they try to do. He makes simple but very telling com- ments on the wrong way to see a Greek tragedy, as when a critic isolates a line or two and finds in them the "key" to the play. Vickers stresses that a play is a continuing and evolving situation and that its "mean- ing" changes in a vital way through the partic- ipation of its audience. One would think this an obvious truth; but Vickers is right that if it were borne in mind, a mass of irrelevant crit- icism might be avoided. If his section on myth is somewhat too long and detailed, he does reach a clear and valuable conclusion - that Greek myths embody truths of Greek so- ciety and history. There is no reason, for in- stance, to imagine that the Homeric poems give us a version distorted by folklore, imagination, et cetera, of what must have been a primitive period of "true" myth. If I have some reservations about Vickers 's absolute championship of the individual and "character" as the heart of the Greek trag- edy, his is certainly a far saner and more moving and truthful way to see the plays than to handle them in reference to such cloudy abstractions as dike and nemesis, of which, in some way, they are supposed to be rep- resentations. This is particularly true when it is so easy to demonstrate, as Vickers does 510</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS with the help of some recent scholars, that such abstractions cannot be proved to have been the beliefs of the time, nor to have had anything like the import that their latter day academic critics have given them. One of Vickers 's bits of apocalyptic simplicity that blows away masses of nonsense is his state- ment that one needs more than a couple of lines in a play or poem to prove the existence of a whole pattern of theology and philosophy in an age. As it is difficult even to indicate the scope of this book, I must be content to comment on some especially interesting arguments. Vickers follows T. H. J. Lloyd-Jones in as- serting the continuity and structure in the treatment of myths from Homer to Apollo- dorus - a period of about a thousand years. This view is at variance with those of such scholars as E. R. Dodds who find decisive shifts in moral feeling during the fifth century, and interpret the myths, as then rendered, in the same spirit. Vickers declares "the same basic moral response to violations of the social code will be seen at one end of the period as the other, and the same concern with manifest, not latent meanings " - for Vickers will have no truck with allegory in Greek myths. This is very provocative. For comparative purposes can we imagine "the same basic moral response to violations of the social code" in Europe, or any part of it, in the period between the Norman Conquest of En- gland and the present day? I would think it extremely doubtful. Certainly I should doubt whether Christianity and the Christian myth, which ostensibly could maintain the con- tinuity, have done so, in the terms that Vickers suggests of the Greek myths. Yet Vickers may be right - or more right than wrong anyway - for the character of these Greek myths, as they were rendered to the generations, may be the explanation. As early in the fifth century as Herodotus, there is no clear distinction between literary truth and religious truth. Herodotus flatly states that Homer and Hesiod created the theogony and assigned to the gods their names and their functions; this at once distances these poetic "myths" from the sacred story and historical uniqueness that characterized Vanderbilt University announces the Harold Stirling Vanderbilt Scholarships.

One can believe in basic com- mon values, or at least attitudes, toward a problem in Shakespeare's Othello; and in Verdi the story of Othello is not part of the Gospels. Granted that Homer is sometimes used by later Greeks as an authority on his- tory, his most important interest for them lies elsewhere. He is the source - one of the main sources - of the everchanging but also permanent truth that inheres in great imagi- native literature. Vickers says, ". . . since the Olympian gods are individualized, poly- theistic, anthropomorphic they cannot be in- terpreted as forming a collective, ethical or metaphysical system." Yes, perhaps, if you interpret "system" strictly. But there is in Homer a very strong and consistent presenta- tion of a tragic universe in which gods and men play interacting roles, both equally "real" and both equally "imagined" in a story. A picture of a tragic universe with both men and gods in it does, I think, take in "basic moral response to violations of the social code." It may be that the flexibility of artistic creation preserves this more effec- tively through the thousand years of its ex- istence than the insistence on sacred truth. In his discussion of Aristotle's Poetics Vickers follows Gerald Else's book and ac- cepts Else's theory that hamartia means no less and no more than a mistake about the identity of someone related to you by blood. He supports this with Aristotle's emphasis on agnoia (ignorance) and anagnorisis (rec- ognition), and by pointing to Aristotle's re- striction of his "best examples" of tragedy to the families of Thyestes and Oedipus, where the violence and pollution is conspicuously due to ignorance of the enormity of the sin be- cause of ignorance of relationship to the vic- tim. It is a bit doubtful if either Else or Vickers is entirely right here; but it is not at all doubtful that the right road with Aristo- tle's criticism is that which Vickers follows: to interpret Aristotle's theory by the examples he gives us, and to avoid implications for the rest of the history of tragedy. Vickers and Else certainly make a very credible argument that Aristotle meant hamartia as they claim he did. Vickers certainly illuminates point after point in particular plays using Aristotle strictly, without pestering us with exten- sions of Aristotle's words to forms of trag- edy where they can have a tortured rele- vance at best. It is possible to read Vickers 's account óf the Poetics and to be grateful to both Aristotle and Vickers, instead of fight- ing down the irritation and boredom that the mention of the Poetics nowadays is all too cal- culated to arouse. Vickers says that Towards Greek Tragedy is the first volume, to which there will be a suc- cessor, covering, in the main, tragedy since the Greeks. If the second volume is anywhere near as comprehensive and searching as the first, he will have done an immense job. I look forward to the next installment.</page></plain_text>
