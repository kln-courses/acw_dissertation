"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, people continue to be fascinated by the remnants of the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, two millenia dis- tant in time," Dubois writes.1 This affirmation is welcome news for a discipline that had been "in crisis" in the late 1980s, partly due to its withdrawal from public life.2 The current resuscitation of dead languages owes greatly to their translation into forms appreciable by modern high-tech visual sensibilities and their orientation toward hot political issues. Troy, starring Brad Pitt as Achil- les, is the most recent example of this trend. However much classicists might balk at the deaths of Menalaus and Agamemnon, or at other deviations from Homers Iliad, the movies impressive technological effects and its implications for current world conflicts bring ancient civilizations and literature into the public consciousness as relevant, living knowledge. If Troy in many ways breaks faith with the epic from which it draws, its narrative liberties also emphasize that classics is a field whose longevity depends on its malleability through time and within multiple arenas of discourse. But is there a point at which manipulation of classical texts and reposition- ing of the ancient world vis-à-vis contemporary culture can threaten classics rather than contribute to its vibrancy? Dubois believes this point has been reached by reductive, neoconservative appropriations of the classics, "which narcissistically see . . . the ancient world as identical to [conservative goals], as fully explained by narratives of nationalism, domestication and family values, militarism, partriarchy, and elitism." Viewing this delivery of classics to the</page><page sequence="2">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 131 people as a deceptive "Trojan Horse" that will ultimately destroy the discipline to which it appears to do homage, Dubois fears that "classics as a field will wither like Egyptology because of its association with such reactionary ideas."3 The fear is warranted not only by Egyptology's decline but by the social history of classics itself. Throughout most of the nineteenth century, classics in Britain was firmly tied to conservative, primarily androcentric, cultural ideals. By the latter part of the century, the discipline was in danger of becoming obsolete as critics like T.H. Huxley, who endorsed a more practical, scientific education, openly criticized the elitism fostered by a "liberal education" grounded upon the literary-linguistic study of Greek and Latin.4 Classics did not fade into obscu- rity at this time because it expanded to accommodate scientific approaches to the ancient world, opening itself up to new fields such as archaeology, anthro- pology, and sociology. What is striking about the salvation of classics from conservative thought at the turn of the twentieth century, however, is that it did not depend on a detachment from personal, revolutionary agendas and a disinterested concern to get at the truth of an ancient civilization, a strategy Dubois proposes for the present. Rather, the modern discipline of classics5 was shaped by methodological and ideological conflicts between scholars with intensely personal investments in their limited and often biased perceptions of the ancient world. While it may be tempting to view the current situation in terms of a categorical opposition between conservatives and liberals, his- tory reveals that such categories often veil textured, individual motives and interactions that inevitably complicate resolutions to the larger problem. In formulating new strategies for keeping classics alive in the twenty-first century, it is worthwhile to reflect on a similar struggle at the turn of the twentieth century over control of a discipline whose unstable borders lend it to individual appropriation and for which territorialism has become an inextricable part of its substance. Jane Harrisons ambivalent relationship to Greek studies at Cambridge during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries exemplifies how individuals can impact scholarship more through the force of their personal convictions than through the soundness of their ideas.6 Helping to pioneer the integration of archaeological, ethnological, and sociological theories into Hellenic studies at the turn of the twentieth century, Harrison devoted her- self to rescuing classics from what she called the "hortus siccus"7 of a literary and linguistically-based study, closed-off from scientific advancements that were uncovering a more complex and multifaceted view of the ancient world than that represented by the Golden Age ideals of humanistic Hellenism. But despite her stated effort to reveal previously neglected truths about archaic Greece, Harrison s work was rooted in a highly individualized epistemology that constituted a narrative of her own experience of knowing: an experience overshadowed by her sense of peripherality in the male-dominated institution</page><page sequence="3">132 Journal of Modem Literature where she spent the majority of her career.8 Intensely conscious of her deficien- cies in literary-linguistic knowledge, due to her lack of early formal training, Harrison mitigated her alienation from nineteenth-century classical scholar- ship by asserting her privileged insight into the archaic world through her "sympathetic imagination ." This was a creative, personal form of cognition that denied the complete comprehensibility of the archaic age and that defied both the analytical principles of "pure scholarship"9 and the rationalist foundations of "scientific method."10 Identifying with the "daimones" that she believed to have governed the natural cycles of death and rebirth in the archaic world, Harrison initiated a crusade for spiritual renewal in Greek scholarship by delib- erately undermining the ideological, religious, and institutional foundations of classical tradition and by sublimating her own desire for scholarly legitimacy into a quest for the redemptive transformation of her field into a living body of knowledge.11 Harrisons "daimonic" narrative of archaic Greece, based upon her self-determined, heroic alienation from what she termed "sound scholar- ship," demonstrates how individuality can be experienced through manipula- tion of the boundaries that define a body of knowledge and how categories of knowledge can shape themselves in response to an individual. Most impor- tantly, Harrisons story emphasizes that classics can survive because, perhaps more than any other academic field, it allows for the creative reconstitution of critical desire and for its own continual reconceptualization. ******* Harrisons formulation of the "sympathetic imagination" and her campaign to save Greek from conservative, institutional traditions lie in a personal history of desire, rebellion, and exile that began with her reading of the Gospels. "The apparatus of religion interested me," Harrison wrote in her autobiography, Reminiscences of a Student's Life}2 I followed the prayers in Latin, and the lesson in German, and the Gospel in Greek; this with some misgivings as to the whole-heartedness' of this proceed- ing.13 A keen impulse was given to my study of the Greek Testament by the arrival of a new curate. He was fresh from Oxford and not, I think averse to showing off. Rashly in one of his sermons he drew attention to a mistranslation. This filled me with excitement and alarm. I saw in a flash that the whole question of the Verbal inspiration of the Bible* was at issue. That afternoon I took my Greek Testament down to the Sunday School and, eager for further elucidation, waylaid the hapless curate. I soon found that his knowledge of Greek was, if possible, more slender than my own.14 Harrisons joyful appreciation for the mis-translatability of the New Testa- ment lay a solid stone in the foundation of her later protest against Christian frameworks of Greek study. Though she early questioned her step-mothers</page><page sequence="4">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 133 fervent Evangelicalism, she could give herself "whole-heartedly" to the Bible precisely because the mysteriousness of its language held out the possibility of challenging its authority. The knowledge of Greek not only put her on a par with an Oxford graduate but transformed what she was already beginning to reject as an overly dogmatic religion into an intellectual challenge. As Har- rison presents it, this early substitution of Christianity with a devotion to the mysteries of language was the inspirational beginning of her academic career as a skeptic of theological doctrine and a lover of Greek. Her aversion toward the institutional rigidity of the former only cemented her devotion to the personal liberty of the latter. "To realise the release that Aristotle brought, you must have been reared as I was in a narrow school of Evangelicalism," she wrote of her study of the Ethics at Newnham College, Cambridge. "The notion of the summum bonum as an 'energy', as an exercise of personal faculty, to one who had been taught that God claimed all. ... I remember walking up and down in the College garden, thinking could it possibly be true, were the chains really broken and the prison doors open."15 The contrast between the "narrow school" of religion and the spiritual and mental freedom of reading Aristotle in Newnham s gardens emphasizes Harrisons dissociation of Greek knowledge from institutional constraint. Even if Aristotle was required reading, his Greek appealed to the "personal faculty" of the intellect, which is capable of resisting external authority and excavating the world of the unknown that would later become Harrisons god. This worship of the unknown, however, was battered into Harrison by the inaccessibility of knowledge. For her early insight into the power that the knowledge of Greek held as well as her later attraction to Greek philosophy were counterbalanced by the limited classical education available to girls in the mid-nineteenth century and by her awareness that women could not participate in the discursive arena where Greek scholarship mattered. Even after estab- lishing her considerable reputation as a Hellenist, Harrisons descriptions of her relationship with Greek resonate with longing for an unattainable dream. Reflecting on her early love of Greek in a paper first read before the London Sociological Society and the Cambridge Branch of Suffragists in 1913, she wrote: [T]he dear delight of learning for learnings sake a "dead" language for sheer love of the beauty of its words and the delicacy of its syntactical relations, the joy of tracking out the secret springs of the human body irrespective of patient and doctor, the rapture of reconstructing for the first time in imagination a bit of the historical past, that was, that in a few laggard minds still obscurely is, unwomanly. Why? ... 'I do not see how Greek grammar is to help little Jane to keep house when she has a home of her own.' . . . [T]he child understood [her aunt]: she was a little girl, and thereby damned to eternal domesticity; she heard the gates of the temple of Learning clang as they closed.16</page><page sequence="5">134 Journal of Modem Literature Images of gates and barriers resurface in many of Harrisons writings on her scholarly career, sometimes shutting in her face and sometimes opening up a vista of opportunity before her. But always in these images, she is standing at the threshold, accepting neither exile nor invitation. On the one hand, this self- positioning indicates the lasting impact of her lack of early Greek education on her confidence as a scholar and on her sense of alienation from the academic institutions that legitimate scholarship. But these images also carry the excite- ment of one who has learned to appreciate liminality; who no longer wants to relinquish the thrill of desire for the comfort of possession. For Harrison, the very seductiveness of Learning lies on this borderline between the confidence of knowing and the rapturous fantasy that comes from not knowing. The "secret springs of the human body" are alluring because they are secret and thus subject to the will of the mind. "I am moving about in worlds half unrealised,"17 she wrote in 1901, as she began the most productive period in her career. By that time, she could claim the indefinite space between imagination and reality as her intellectual arena, but this world of half-unreality became "a home of her own" only after Harrisons experience of exile. For Harrison, Greek was both a homeland and a land of exile. When she entered Newnham in 1874 and could indulge her longing to learn Greek,18 the language remained frustratingly elusive and continued to hold the aura of the unknowable. "Greek literature as a specialism I early felt was barred to me," she wrote in Reminiscences. "The only field of research that the Cambridge of my day knew of was textual criticism, and for fruitful work in that my scholar- ship was never adequate."19 Harrisons sense of her "inadequacy" was no doubt strengthened by the unexpected second she received in her Classical Tripos examinations in 1879, the year before the exam was divided into two parts and two years before women were formally admitted into University examina- tions.20 The divided Tripos would have allowed students to receive independent scores on a special field (ancient philosophy, history, or archaeology), where the focus was not exclusively on linguistic knowledge. The undivided Tripos, on the other hand, consisted primarily of translation and composition papers (ten out of fourteen). Her sense of her inadequacy as a Greek scholar further increased when she was passed over for the first Newnham Lectureship in classics, which was given instead to her younger friend Margaret Merrifield (later Mrs. A.W. Verrall), whom Harrison herself had urged to take the Clas- sical Tripos.21 The loss of the lectureship meant an unforeseen departure from Cambridge and the beginning of an almost twenty-year study of ancient Greek art and archaeology outside the context of a home institution. Although these years of traveling, research, and lecturing at the British Museum, schools, and universities put her in contact with leading scientists, artists, and literary figures of the day,22 Harrisons lingering "hurt pride"23 over her dismissal from Newnham prevented her from fully accepting the role of a "populist for Greek</page><page sequence="6">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 135 art" that she assumed during these years.24 Her memory of lecturing during these years is tinged with irony: In those days I met many specimens of a class of Victorian who, if not exactly distinguished, were at least distinctive and are, I think, all but extinct - British Lions and Lionesses. The Lionesses first - that was the name we gave them at Newnham. They were all spinsters, well-born, well-bred, well-educated and well off. They attended my lectures on Greek Art. Greek Art was at that time booming and was eminently respectable. At home they gardened a great deal; they, most of them, had country houses. Their gardens were a terror to me, for I never could remember the names of the plants. . . . Above all, they kept a vigilant eye on the shortcomings of local officials. . . .25 Written in 1925 after twenty-four years establishing her reputation as a Cam- bridge Hellenist, Harrison s Reminiscences barely conceals her lingering distaste for her stint as a public intellectual. The opposition between "we at Newn- ham" and "them" in their frightening country gardens sprinkles bitterness into bemusement. The terms "specimen," "class," "extinct" turn the scientific gaze of the reabsorbed Newnhamite on the socialites "vigilant eye." It is a staring contest across the decades that implicitly questions the meaning of being "well- educated." In Harrisons view of knowledge, what matters is not whether one has learned but whether one chooses to make a life of learning - a life that can only thrive "in institutions renouncing the rank egotism of Home Life."26 When Harrison was invited back to Newnham in 1898, 27 she had already acquired a reputation both as a public luminary and a specialist in classical art and archaeology. Besides her popular lectures, she had worked with the prominent archaeologist Wilhelm Dörpfeld in his excavations in Athens in 1888, 28 written her third book Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens (with Margaret Verrall nee Merrifield) in 1890, 29 and twice stood for the Yates Pro- fessorship of Archaeology at University College, one of the most coveted posi- tions in the field. The accumulation of professional achievements on her resume gave her self-assurance and argumentative leverage to promote the equality of archaeological research with literary, "pure" scholarship at the university. It also gave her the confidence to declare her new area of specialization upon her return to the University - archaic Greek religion. Ancient religion was an emerging field of study at Cambridge and had less of a discursive basis than other sections in Part II of the Tripos, with which it was grouped - philosophy, history, and philology.30 This lack of a formal discourse granted specialists in the field a certain creative freedom of which Harrison took full advantage in her Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion , written during her first years back at Newnham.31 Punctuated with assertions about the inscrutability of archaic religion, The Prolegomena sets out to undermine the possibility of reaching a state of</page><page sequence="7">136 Journal of Modem Literature perfect knowledge. Its windings through what one reviewer called "fanci- ful," "misleading," "specious" argumentation and its "wandering thoughts" and "merry jests"32 all aim to expand the minds conceptual parameters beyond the boundaries of literary and artistic evidence. The truths it proffers about Greek religion derive their force and conviction not from the plethora of texts, paintings, and sculptures it cites but from the surprising narrative twists and conclusions unfolding from Harrisons own creative imagination. For example, speaking of archaic rites addressed to "those below, who are black and bad and malignant," she writes: We know what was done, though we have no English word fully to express that doing. This fact may well remind us that we have lost not only the word but the thought, and must be at some pains to recover it. ... I do not deny that the word can be translated if we are content to vary our rendering in each various case. . . . No one word carries the whole field. It is this lost union of many diverse elements that has to be recovered and is nameless.33 The idea of a nameless recovery is strikingly oxymoronic, especially in a text- book.34 The admission puts into doubt the authors didactic purposes. But for Harrison, archaic religion is valuable precisely because its unknownness allows for a variability of truths that escape linguistic capture and permit an intimacy of knowledge formed through an individualized vocabulary. Through the irrecoverability of its vocabulary, archaic religion presents Harrison with an academic field wherein the consciousness of her inadequate linguistic training can be transformed into an epistemology of loss and a rationale for imaginative recovery. She claims that it is only "by an effort of the sympathetic imagination [that we can] think back . . . into the haze of . . . primitive [conceptions]."35 The "sympathetic imagination" that Harrison asserts is essential for understanding archaic religion is a reformulation of the modern "scientific instinct" that she had deemed necessary for the study of Greek art earlier in her career.36 Resist- ing "clear analytic thought," Harrison s version of scientific investigation into archaic religion emphasizes the investigators ability to re-inhabit the primitive mentality of the archaic Greek and to identify the truth of archaic thought through identifying it with his own imaginative capacities.37 Announcing her re-entry into the gates of Learning, The Prolegomena is as much Harrisons reflection on the personal, spiritual foundation of knowledge itself as on what is known about the Greeks. Harrisons advocacy for the importance of the narrative imagination in understanding Greek religion was fundamental to what became for her a spiri- tual mission to reinvigorate an institution that she felt was "losing touch with life and reality" just like the Olympians of the Golden Age whose "luminous perfection"38 she had challenged in her Prolegomena. Recognizing that journal articles and reviews were vital to the circulatory system of ideas nourishing the</page><page sequence="8">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 137 classical community, Harrison injected hers like hypodermic shots, prepared to shock the system into reaction and life.39 One of the most potent drugs in her arsenal was her conviction that the scholar s personality and motives were as valuable as his theories. Her insistence on the "living" force of an idea and the effects of this insistence on the classical body are evidenced in what in her own words was an "intemperate review"40 of the third and fourth volumes of Lewis Farnells Cults of the Greek States. The review condemned the noted Oxford Hellenist for taking the "canonical Olympians [as] his Aristotelian categories." Farnells association of Greek cults almost exclusively with familiar Olympian gods - rather than with the mystery deities that Harrison herself studied - earns him the accusation of having a "medieval method and spirit" that disregards "all the apparatus of novelty [and] great stores of new learning." The aim of Harrison s criticism is not so much Farnells ideas as the spirit in which they were conceived. Farnells book was written, she states, "because he or his possible readers think that something ought to be said." In contrast to this satisfaction of public demand is the work produced through purely egoistic motives: [T]he book written under the impulse of a new idea, is like a live thing, begotten he knows not how, in the writer's brain; he has only partial control over the form it takes, probably he does not want to write at all, he would rather sit and dream; but this live thing stirs and flutters, haunts him by night and day, goads him almost to madness, till at last he can bear it no more, and willy-nilly he brings it to birth in a book - ... It is practically sure to be overfocussed, that is part of the intensity of first vision, but the reviewer need not and does not criticize the method and form of the book as distinguished from its content, because in a live thing 'body and soul are one.'41 Beginning with a prolonged, transparent reference to Harrisons own writing methods, the article is as much a proposal to change the critical criteria of the field as it is a review of Farnells book. Not surprisingly, it caused an immediate reaction amongst classicists. Farnell was away when it was published, and Percy Gardner, a professor of classical archaeology at Oxford with whom Harrison had "friendly relations," rose to his colleagues defense, accusing Harrison of unjustly using her personal prejudice for the "superstition" of the "Athenian rabble" as criteria forjudging " a master of his subject."42 "[T]he notice ... is neither review nor criticism, but a call to repentance," wrote Gardner. "Miss Harrisons criticism merely amounts to saying ťhe followeth not with us/" Har- rison truly regretted provoking Gardner,43 but she stuck to her belief about what constituted valuable scholarship and made no effort to deny that her notice was "in some sense, a call to repentance.'" Accepting the role of redeemer, Harrison argued not only that the individual book must be born from a purely egoistic impulse in order to live but that this impulse guaranteed the life of</page><page sequence="9">138 Journal of Modem Literature scholarship. In contrast to Gardner s statement that "a scientific work is not a poem nor a dream of a new social system," Harrison accepted whole-heartedly the social burden of individual genius. The true scholar takes on the risks of "overfocus" and "intensity' to assure the impact of his idea on scholarship as a whole. Farnells sin, in Harrisons eyes, lies in his explicit refusal to accept personal risk. "It has been my object to restrict myself as far as possible to the statement of the facts, and not to wander too far into the region of hypothesis and controversy," he states in his preface to the first volume (1896). One s work thus incurs the risk of a dryness and coldness of tone; and the risk is all the greater because, while Greek mythology was passionate and picturesque, Greek religion was, on the whole, sober and sane. An emotional exposition of [Greek religion] may be of great value for the purposes of literature; but for the purposes of science it is best to exhibit the facts, as far as possible, in a dry light.44 Farnells "sober and sane" view of Greek religion refutes the atheistic ideology Harrison set out forcefully in her Prolegomena . But more alarming for Harrison than this ideological opposition is Farnells calculated intention of avoiding controversy. His exposition of dry facts is a deadly antidote to her vision of a living idea. His professed "risk" is merely a disguise for personal cowardice. Ironically creating a controversy from Farnells deliberate avoidance of conflict, her exposition on the myth-making mind of the scholar attempts to reassert the vital interdependency between the "passionate and picturesque" and the scientific-analytical mentalities. * * * * ♦ * * Harrisons most provocative assault on institutional tradition took place in the winter of 1916-17, while England was in the midst of the Great War. She initiated it with an article on "The Head of John Baptist," which proposed a novel approach to Salome s dance for the Baptists head in the Gospels. The article was published in the December number of The Classical Review , one of the most widely-read and respected journals in the field of classical studies.45 "No one, I suppose, reads the story of the daughter of Herodias and the Head of John Baptist without a sense of sudden jar," the article begins. "In the Old Testament it might stand; in the New its licentious savagery seems an outrage. But for the familiarity of Holy Writ we should probably long ago have asked what lies behind."46 With a flourish of the first-person plural, Harrison sets out with the confident assumption of her readers' repressed disapprobation of the Gospel story. Seeking first to expose and then to answer this desire for moral justification, she proceeds to defamiliarize Holy Writ by comparing the Gospel episode with narratives in ancient, eastern, and Russian mythology and then</page><page sequence="10">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 139 to suggest that Christian "savagery" might find vindication as an adjunct of "sacred" primitive and pagan rituals: The dance of Herodias* daughter with the Head of John Baptist isy mutatis mutandis, the ritual dance of Agave with the head ofPentheus (sic). It is the dance of the daimon of the New Year with the head of the Old Year, past and slain. . . . John the Forerunner has kept some savage elements expurgated from the sacred legend of his Prototype, and these elements rightly understood are not so repulsive as they seem. The loathsome story of the Head and the dance is redeemed at once from its squalour of amorous license and dressed in a new ritual dignity. Any reader of the Classical Review would have immediately recognized the italicized reference to the finale of Euripides' The Bacchae, in which the crazed Theban princess appears triumphantly clutching the severed head of her son, believing it to be that of a lion she has hunted down and killed.47 The attribution of savagery to this gruesome scene is readily comprehensible, as might be the desire to find a mitigating metaphorical explanation. What seems more dubi- ous is that Agave s Bacchic frenzy might redeem Christian Scripture. Indeed if the articles naturalistic explanation for Salomes dance (i.e., as a New Years celebration) vindicates the story from any charges of "licentiousness," it also undermines Christian rationale by identifying Biblical persona as "daimones." "[T]he legend of John Baptist was marked by various daimon traits," Harrison argues, and Salome was possessed by the "intense religious need [for] ritual . . . rejoicing . . . over the dead daimon." The term "daimon" refers generally to gods or spirits of the dead, but Harrisons use of the term was loaded with critical connotations calculated to inspire controversy. In the Prolegomena , Harrison had defined "daimones" as amorphous "poten- cies" with greater spiritual influence than the familiar Olympian "anthropo- morphic divinities Ctheoi')."48 In her 1912 book Themis , she had developed the term into the intensely disputed concept of the "Eniautos Daimon." "I am well aware that no such conjunction as Eniautos-Daimon exists in Greek," she wrote in Themis's introduction: I did not set out to invent any such word, nor did I even foresee its employment; it simply grew on my hands from sheer necessity. ... A word was wanted that should include . . . the whole world-process of decay, death, and renewal. I prefer "Eniautos" to "year" because to us year means something definitely chronologi- cal, precise segment as it were of spatialized time; whereas Eniautos , as contrasted with etoSy means a periodivi the etymological sense, a cycle of waxing and waning. This notion is, I believe, implicitly though not always explicitly, a cardinal factor in Greek religion. Beyond it, to anything like our modern notion of non-recurrent evolution, the Greek never advanced. I prefer the word daimon to 'spirit' because . . . daimon has connotations unknown to our English "spirit."49</page><page sequence="11">140 Journal of Modem Literature As an expression of what Harrison "believes" to be an "implicit factor in Greek religion," the "Eniautos Daimon" is a doubly displaced entity with no his- torical existence beyond Harrison s own desire to bridge a spiritual and verbal chasm between spatially and temporally remote civilizations. Emerging out of "necessity" in the kind of live-birth that Harrison had described in her Farnell review, his formation as an "unknown" concept of collective belief embodies the creative force of an imagination that insists on its individuality by refus- ing to accept available beliefs and categories. As the ultimate embodiment of Harrisons creative ethos, the Eniautos-Daimon not only represents a concept of cyclical time in the archaic Greek mind but argues for an alternative sense of historical continuity for the modern mind - one that cannot be found in the records of history and literature but rather must be imagined in the interstices of measured time and metered translation.50 Used as an interpretive frame- work for the Bible, the concept subverts the traditional relationship of Greek scholarship to Christianity. Rather than strengthening New Testament faith, Harrisons daimon destabilizes the authority of one of the central texts underly- ing the institutional legitimacy of classical studies.51 More than secularizing the Gospels, the article threatens to replace Christian history and teleology with savage ritual as the spiritual foundation of intellectual tradition. The lead article in the journals first February number sounded the alarm that sacrilege may indeed have crept into academia in the guise of scholarship: Miss Harrison s amazing article on the Head of John Baptist in the December number of the Classical Review seems to me to call for some plain-spoken criti- cism. It is confused and confusing, and in its use of certain texts most grossly misleading.52 Harrisons critic was M.R. James, recent Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, pro- vost of Kings College, antiquarian, medievalist, and specialist in Aprocryphal studies.53 Launching into a sardonic denouncement of Harrisons imprecise identification of sources, neglect of crucial historical background, self-contra- dictory, muddled argumentation, and, in particular, her imprecise knowledge of ancient Greek, James pointedly questions the soundness not only of Harrisons thesis and ethics but of her scholarly credentials. Proceeding from a pointedly ad feminam attack, he concludes his article with a scathing indictment of the entire field of academic study that Harrisons article represents: ... is this Comparative Mythology? Or is it tolerable under that or any other name? I have often viewed with very grave suspicion the way in which compara- tive mythologists treat their evidence, but it has not often happened that I have found them gathering it in fields with which I was at all specially familiar. I hope Miss Harrisons use of 'Apocryphal Scriptures' is not an average sample.</page><page sequence="12">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 141 Her article cannot, I feel sure, be the result of very careful thought, and I regret to see that a researcher of her experience can allow herself to make public crude and inconsequent speculations of this kind, which go far to justify those who deny to Comparative Mythology the name and dignity of a science. I believe it to be a science, but only in the making. I also believe that one of the worst services that anyone responsible for the direction of young students can do them is to encourage them to make it the subject of dissertations, or to pro- pound any theory concerning it. Loose thinking, exaggeration of resemblances, ignoring of differences, and downright falsification of evidence, are only a few of the evils which a premature handling of it fosters in its votaries. At once alarmed and dismissive, James s condemnation of Harrison seems to violate the pacifist principles he himself had set forth in his Vice-Chancellor s speech at the outset of the war, when he had urged the university to "confine our controversies within the narrowest limits, and be ready if necessary to postpone them altogether."54 That he had, in his own words, "dipped [his] pen in gall and flayed"55 a fellow scholar, indicates that there was far more at stake than textual misinterpretation in the territorial dispute over the expansion of classical studies. Jamess nearly line-by-line critique of Harrisons article and his skepticism about the legitimacy of her field register a mounting concern for the repercus- sions of scholarly activities on wider political affairs - affairs from which the university had, until the Great War, always maintained a dignified detach- ment.56 But the war prompted an urgent reassessment as well as a rigorous re-fortification of academic values even as the walls between the "dignity" of knowledge and the savagery of experience eroded. Beneath Jamess denuncia- tory rhetoric lies a preoccupation shared by many in the much-depleted Cam- bridge community57 with re-asserting the moral principles that on the one hand justified England s participation in the war and on the other clarified the duty of those who remained at home, in Jamess words, to "keep alive that fire of education, religion, learning and research which will in God s good time outburn the flames of war."58 In the search for ideological stability, scholarship assumed a spiritual burden that was measured and weighed by the terms of opposition and resistance dictating international relations. "Even if ruin should overwhelm this University, it may be found to the last a home of sound learning and religious education," preached the Reverend Foakes-Jackson in October 1914.59 The sermon emphasized that adherence to Christian faith was part of the scholar s arsenal against the enemy. "[Germany] is waging with fierce con- centration unredeemed by generosity one of the first absolutely non-moral wars of history," Foakes-Jackson continued after acknowledging the bond of "mutual study and encouragement" previously shared between England and Germany. Condemning the latters "historico-critical school" for "attacking the Church,</page><page sequence="13">142 Journal of Modem Literature the Creed and the Bible, till all faith has disappeared," he asserted that "such a state of things [as an academic attack on Christian faith] is inconceivable in England:" Christianity is either false and therefore to be eradicated or true and therefore to be cherished at all costs. To regard it as a corpse to be dissected seems even worse than to hate it as a pernicious error. . . . [W]e can only accord to the German at war the admiration Milton compels us to feel for Satan and his fiends. Regarded in light of this polarizing religious rhetoric, Harrison s virtual autopsy of the beheaded Baptist was tantamount to claiming allegiance with the arch- enemy himself - a comparison that James did not fail to suggest in his article.60 By treating Scripture as myth and appealing to German authorities to back her argument, Harrisons article flippantly disproved Foakes-Jackson's patriotic pronouncement of the secure Christian foundations of British scholarship. In the same irreverent spirit, her statement that John is Jesus's "double ... so far as [the] daimon aspect goes" blatantly defied the principles of T.R. Glovers well- attended 1916 Michaelmas lectures on "Jesus as a Historic Personality," which had stated that "it is the acme of bad criticism . . . and profoundly unsatisfactory to make of Jesus only an archaic figure."61 Far from speaking for the academic community as the first lines of her article propose, Harrisons "daimonization" of John and Jesus opposed a common effort within the university to promote Christian faith as an antidote to world catastrophe. Indeed, at a time when many in the nation had begun to think the war a divine punishment for their own abandonment of Christian principles,62 Harrisons article was another step in the wrong direction of self-destructive atheism. Jamess characteriza- tion of her methodology as "evil" - even demonic - contributed to an academic evangelicalism that emphasized the need for systematic discrimination. The "exaggeration of resemblances, ignoring of differences" fostered by the mytho- logical mindset threatened the framework of the nations - not to mention the university's - moral stability. Energized by the wars sudden disruption of academic traditions, the exchange between Harrison and James exposes the broader social, politi- cal, and religious resonance of Greek scholarship by the early-twentieth cen- tury.63 While this debate may appear to be a conflict between an old-school conservative and a new-fangled liberal, Harrisons calculated insubordinance and James's ad feminam rebuttal suggest that broader, political considerations were underpinned by the deeply personal investment that each held in Greek knowledge. The private significance of the affair is witnessed by the fact that Harrison's article lingered in M.R. James's mind long after he had exhausted his "gall" in The Classical Review. Some three months after publishing his initial reaction to Harrison, James took up The Bacchae in a train back to Cambridge from the National Club in London. A letter to his friend Gordon Carey, then</page><page sequence="14">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 143 stationed at the front, indicates that it had been some time since he had looked at the play: This afternoon in the train I read the Helen, Electra ôc Bacchae of the poet Euripides. The Bacchae is really rather horrible: a great fuss is made of it, but the behaviour of the incarnate god to Pentheus (who ... is the man who wants to keep the home together 6c does represent the things that make life possible) is flagitious. I ought I suppose to have read what Verrall has to say about it: if I have, I have forgotten it. Very likely he has said that Pentheus is the man with whom Euripides really sympathizes.64 That James picked up The Bacchae after he had written his condemnation of Harrison testifies to the haste with which he penned his protest as well as to the profound impact that her words had on him - one that was greater than an objection to unsound scholarship could nullify.65 His identification with "the man who wants to keep the home together" suggests that his officious response to Harrison was rooted in a deeper fear that she was undermining his personal sense of stability and threatening "the things that make life possible." Just what these "things" are James does not specify, but his meaning can be gathered by examining the opposing "parts" he and Harrison take in their interpretations of Euripides. The Bacchae had been one of Harrisons favorite tragedies since the Prole- gomena. Using the tragedy as a primary source of evidence, she had identified Dionysos with "a return to nature/ a breaking of bonds and limitations and cystallizations, a desire for the life rather of the emotions than of the reason. . . . This notion of a return to nature is an element in the worship of Dionysos so simple, so moving and in a sense so modern that we realize it without effort."66 Harrisons interpretation of Dionysos as a nature god representing emotional liberation from rational boundaries as well as her sense of his modernity derive, in part, from the popularity of this concept in late-nineteenth century litera- ture, art, and philosophy. Nietzche had written about the "Dionysian principle" in The Birth of Tragedy (1872).67 Walter Pater had celebrated the nature god and suggested his relevance to the modern spirit in his 1876 "Study of Dionysus," noting that "Shelleys Sensitive Plant shows in what mists of poetical reverie such feeling [of nature-worship] may still float about a mind full of modern lights, the feeling we too have of a life in the green world, always ready to assert its claim over our sympathetic fancies."68 Pater s appreciation for the aesthetic merits of Dionysian worship was shared by classicist painters like Frederic Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema, whom Pater admired and for whom Dionysos and his Bacchante followers became symbols of their break from the moralistic, Ruskinian ethos of the Pre-Raphaelites.69 Closer to Harrisons own field, Sir James Frazer had discussed Dionysoss role as god of agriculture, the corn, and trees in The Golden Bough (1890), 70 and Harrisons colleagues A.W.</page><page sequence="15">144 Journal of Modem Literature Verrall and William Ridgeway had both written about Dionysos as a nature god. For Harrison, however, the most influential Dionysian commentary came not from mythography or anthropology but from literary scholarship. One of the central inspirations for the Prolegomena was Gilbert Murray's discussion of the Bacchae in his 1897 book^ History of Ancient Greek Literature , in which he wrote: [T]here is ... a certain tone of polemic against 'mere rationalism' which has every appearance of coming from the poet himself. . . . Reason is great, but it is not everything. There are in the world things not of reason, but both below and above it; causes of emotion, which we cannot express, which we tend to worship, which we feel, perhaps, to be the precious elements in life. These things are God or forms of God: not fabulous immortal men, but 'Things which Are,' things utterly non-human and non-moral, which bring man bliss or tear his life to shreds without a break in their own serenity.71 Finishing her Prolegomena in 1902, Harrison asked and received permission from Murray to quote this passage at the end of the book for, as she confessed to him, it has "been a sort of theological (mythological) Alpha and Omega to me and was long before I knew its inadequate author, in fact it first really started the plot of my book [The Prolegomeni 4 years ago"72 Harrison and Murray were to remain close friends throughout her tenure at Cambridge, partly due to their shared passion for Euripides, but Harrison would put her passion to revolutionary ends that exceeded the realm of aesthetic vision or philosophical ideal, adopting the polemic against "mere rationalism" as her own practical ethos. Whereas Murray's comments are conditioned by his tone of interpretive conjecture, Harrison draws on a popularized, aestheticized image of Dionysos to make a definitive statement about archaic Greek society and to institute a change in critical discourse. The image of Dionysos provides Harrison with a vehicle for transporting the languages of classicist aestheticism and literary interpretation to scientific discourse as ammunition against the withering sanity and sobriety of institutional tradition. Harrisons interest in Dionysos as a figure of spiritual rejuvenation for the modern world, and, in particular, classical scholarship, expands upon Pater s regard for the god and his maenadic followers as revitalizing inspirations for modern art.73 Though she would become increasingly disenchanted with the violent elements of Dionysian worship, Harrison maintained the bias through- out her career that the emotionality and mysticism of Dionysian faith was an essential element of historical continuity between the ancient and modern reli- gious experience. In a letter of 1907, she reports on getting "stormy* with her friend A.W. Verrall for siding with Pentheus,74 as James had rightly predicted. In her 1916 John Baptist article, she tempers her once passionate partiality for</page><page sequence="16">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 145 Dionysos the god, but maintains the justice of Pentheuss murder by interpret- ing it as an aspect of natures inevitable cycle of death and re-birth. According to this view, Dionysos - who has himself been killed and resurrected75 - acts as an agent in the life cycle by causing the king to be slaughtered by his mother, Agave. Harrison s interpretive framework dissociates the three figures from the themes of vengeance and guilt that govern Euripides s play in order to argue for a universalizing concept of cyclical renewal. Rather than placed antagonisti- cally toward each other, the characters are collapsed into a common denomi- nator of "daimonic" forces. The removal of individual motivation thus allows Harrison to identify the be-headed Baptist both with Pentheus and with his enemy Dionysos - as well as with a number of other legendary murder victims. For Harrison, the "life-history of the year daimon" absorbs the identities of "such figures as Tammuz, Adonis, Osiris, Orpheus, Dionysos"76 (as well as John Baptist and his "double" Jesus Christ) into representatives of the "stages of the year itself, or rather the fertility of the year." Sharing the "life-history" of the year-daimon, Dionysos, Pentheus, John, and Christ are all personifica- tions of mans "intense religious need" for a sense of historical continuity. As suggested by ritual celebrations of death, this sense is felt at its keenest in the moment of destruction, when individuality dissolves into process. While he shares Harrisons concern for the Bacchae's broader philosophi- cal implications, Jamess reading of the tragedy opposes the life force to the destructive elements Harrison deifies. In contrast to her regard for the divine elements that represent deaths inevitability, his sympathy with Pentheus privi- leges the individuals resistance to death, however futile the effort. This differ- ence in philosophical perspective was rooted in personal experience. Burdened by the responsibilities of a spiritual and political leader in wartime, James might very well identify with Pentheuss disgust at the bacchic revelry of the Theban women and his desire to squelch the new faith introduced by Dionysos.77 His defense of the Theban kings attempt to maintain order indicates a momen- tary clearing of his own increasing sense of personal obscurity as the war progressed.78 Indeed, The Bacchae seems to have impelled James to articulate a more personal response to Harrisons article in a different public forum. In a sermon commemorating the anniversary of Saints Simon and Jude, preached at the church of St. Edward the King in Cambridge on 28 October, 1917, James reveals his own Penthean efforts to resist both the physical disruption of the war and the spiritual threat of those like Harrison who, Dionysos-like, would undermine traditional belief systems. "Is it merely an interesting, or even a not very interesting piece of ritual that is here presented to us?" he begins. A minor scene in what people are fond of calling the liturgical drama? Certainly we can make it so: we can note the special features of the service: Collect, Epistle and Gospel, and Lesson . . . and think no more of the matter . . . but it is possible</page><page sequence="17">146 Journal of Modem Literature and reasonable to deal differently. . . . [M]inor things ... in the course of cen- turies have tended to become in the eyes of many mere pieces of ritual and drill. . . . [But] some are able to expend themselves with complete sincerity upon the observance as it is laid down and to find in it a living meaning, and, what is more a channel still open for communication between their souls and the Infinite. To these the acts and processes of ecclesiastical worship are by long practice natural. The child is always speaking to his Father in this special language: its surround- ings and idioms are . . . sacred in his eyes. . . . Others, who are many in these days and in this country, are on the whole inclined to be suspicious of observances.79 "The Head of John Baptist" attends this sermon like the proverbial pink ele- phant. James s emphasis on the personal significance of rituals implicitly rejects Harrisons focus on the mere act of repetition. As seen in her interpretations of Salome and Pentheus, the prescribed acts and formulaic proceedings of ritual distance individuals from the "squalor" of personal motivation. Religious feeling arises from the dissipation of individuality into what Harrison called a "mystical oneness with all things."80 Religion, for Harrison, is essentially an experience of self-estrangement. For James, on the other hand, rituals are important insofar as they can assume an individualized meaning and help the individual establish personal intimacy with God. Rituals have a concentrative rather than diffusive force, such that the "oneness" achieved through religious experience constitutes a private communion that shuts out all others. Jamess own rhetoric recreates this exclusive religious atmosphere by arguing, rather tautologically, that those who regard Christian ritual as mere "drama" are spectators, not true participants, of worship. Their own doubt casts them as outsiders to the sacred "surroundings and idioms" of the faith and disqualify them from interpreting the "special language" of Christian ceremony - not to mention the words of Scripture that are the written representations of that language. Jamess use of the oppositional terms "some," "many," and "others" serve as much to mark off sacred space from those like Harrison who are "suspi- cious of observances" as to define this space for "natural" believers who hardly need his explanation. However much rituals may serve as merely the outer walls around a sacred space accessible to a privileged few, these institutional boundaries are never- theless essential in preserving the "living meaning" within. James stresses the crucial role of the public institution in preserving private worship in a seemingly tangential remark on the Christian celebration of the dead that allusively argues against Harrisons interpretations of death rituals. I am led [from discussion of Saints Simon and Jude] to . . . turn ... to the feast of All Saints [when] we shall recite . . . the names of the Cambridge men who have fallen. . . . These are public rites: but there are others. Upon that day each of us will have his own roll of honour: . . . people of whom all that you could</page><page sequence="18">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 147 find to say would resolve into this, that they stayed at home and were Christians there. . . . The sum of the matter is that their lives [versus those who have gone off to fight] may have been so inconspicuous that when you too have passed out of sight, they will not be remembered at all, and yet these lives mean more to you than anything else in the world. . . . Love of the work we are doing will carry us a long way, no doubt, but if we cannot see that it is part of a greater thing than itself, part of a cause or an institution worthy of love, there will come a day when it will appear unreal and not worth doing.81 Jamess final remark on the necessity of committing to a larger, impersonal institution that transcends any one life seems at first to contradict his emphasis throughout the sermon on the over-riding importance of private relations. His point, however, is not to endorse one above the other but to invest institutional relations with the force of devotion one might hold for a loved one or for God. It is only as a beloved being that the institution can compensate for the real- ity and sense of self-worth threatened by the loss of a beloved individual. As with the desire for personal communion with God, the love of an institution is rooted in a fundamental human longing for the tangible, the known, the real that constitutes the life-instinct. According to this view, the horror of The Bacchae lies not so much in the play itself as in a reading of it that associates the life-instinct with the erasure of individual values and that sanctions a death resulting from self-disguise, misrecognition, loss of self-consciousness, and the sacrifice of tangible, "real" relations to the illusion of Dionysian mysticism. It is just the instinct for self-preservation against these Dionysian threats that drives James's defense of academic traditions - traditions that, for him, are inseparable from the life -sustaining force of personal faith. On 31 July, 1917 he wrote to Gordon Carey: "The available people here are few. . . . [TJhere is not much to diversify existence. In fact were it not for work having to be done 6c work that can be done in the way of research ... I should be puzzled."82 For James, work meant the meticulous task of collating, translating and com- menting on obscure Apocryphal manuscripts as well as writing and delivering sermons.83 If his letter implies that such tasks are mere "diversions," they are nevertheless functionally equal to what James called "the undoubted value of discipline and regularity" afforded by ecclesiastical observance. Both involve a methodical process aimed at maintaining familiar structures of meaning when the inescapable awareness of the unknown and unknowable makes existence itself "appear unreal and not worth doing." Harrison wrote her provocative article on John Baptist partly to ensure that the preservation of individual existence would not result in the ossification of knowledge and thus threaten the life of scholarship. Like James, she invested research with a sacred value, but while for him academic work derived its ultimate worth from institutions "larger than itself," she regarded knowledge</page><page sequence="19">148 Journal of Modem Literature as a vital being in its own right, independent of institutional structures and deserving the undiluted commitment of its worshippers. "[T]he world of things to be known is my god, I value them intensely; so they become my religion,"84 she wrote to her friend Francis Cornford, opposing her religion of "things to be known" to his devout Christianity. In continually reaching beyond familiar structures to horizons of the unknown, the scholar s research aspires, in Harri- son s view, toward the same goal of self-estrangement with which she associates Dionysian ritual. "Gods and theology are always ... a temporary phase, always perforce fabricated, and only to be broken," she wrote in 1915. "[T]hey are husks, shells, that the swelling kernel of religion must always break through; and by religion I mean . . . just that commerce with the unseen and unknown that we have by virtue of our 'free ideas.'"85 Harrisons equation between the life of thought (i.e. of "free ideas") and the religious impulse for mystical com- munion directly opposes James s emphasis on the basic human need to know and be known. His Christian God and his research are familiar and "loved" for their familiarity, while for her religion is "the beckoning, sometimes almost the threatening, of the unseen . . . the not fully known."86 This contrast between a religion of love and one of fear explains why James's institutional reinforcements during the war are for Harrison the hardened husks and shells that suffocate the vital, spiritual impulse of scholarship beyond the reassurance of the known. "War, if it cannot, and shall not, slay, can most grievously wound learning,"87 she wrote in 1914, anticipating the cessation of research as international turmoil shifted previous priorities. She expressed her concern again a month later in her "Epilogue on the War:" "Learning, and still more research, is a hard mistress; she will have your whole heart or none of you. . . ,"88 Christianity threatened Harrisons religion of the "unseen and unknown" by diverting the hearts and minds of the scholars around her. Indeed, she had registered with surprise the resurgence of religious belief at the war s outset, noting: "[I]t is very funny now- a-days . . . the importance of people being simple and rather stupid and doing their duty at home and having a religion. ... I knew this Catholic reaction was on in France, but I did not know that Jacques and Gwen [Raverat] and Rupert [Brooke] etc., were all in it here."89 Harrisons light, somewhat scornful obser- vation here in 1914 disguises her mounting anxiety over the death of scholarly work - a death heralded by the onset of a regime of simplicity, stupidity, and Christian complacency. Having contemplated an article on "my favorite saint - John Baptist" at least since 1914, 90 Harrison finally published it just at the moment when she felt her god of "things to be known" was threatened by the common desire for a known God. Going against her friends' return to religion and duty and performed in full recognition of the institutional commandments she was breaking, it was as much an attempt to salvage her faith as James s sermons were delivered in the name of his Christian God. Indeed if the equation of</page><page sequence="20">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 149 Christianity and paganism was the stake upon which she burned, the amal- gam god of Dionysos and the Christian saint also embodied Harrisons vision of her personal crusade in crossing that perilous border where the "swelling kernel of religion must always break through." On the one hand, this image of rupture identifies Harrison with Dionysos as a destructive force. But Harrison s comparison of Dionysos with John Baptist emphasizes that the Greek god is also a mystic who, like the Baptist, is associated with acts of initiation and salvation. As Harrison wrote in her Prolegomena , Dionysos "came into Greece . . . [j]ust when [the Olympian gods] were losing touch with life and reality, fading and dying of their own luminous perfection [and brought] an impulse really religious . . . Mysticism."91 Just as John Baptist is a "Forerunner" of Jesus who, as the opening lines of Harrisons article suggest, occupies an ambiguous space between the Old and New Testaments,92 so Dionysos is an outsider to established faith who ultimately represents purgation and enlightenment. Just how Dionysos s role as religious Salvationist applies to Harrison s own spiritual mission lies in her perception of the contrast between the Greek god and the Christian saint. For though her article might collapse John and Dio- nysos into the year daimon, Harrison held distinct attitudes toward them as mythic-historic individuals. For her, John is an ultimately defeated figure with whom she identified when she felt particularly discouraged, unappreciated or misunderstood.93 He is the "lone voice in the wilderness" who, as she states in her article, "[is] obscured by the figure of Him to whom he was Forerunner." Dionysos, on the other hand, is a triumphant god - the hero of a play that she called in 1912 "the document of the New Birth."94 Even as Dionysoss identi- fication with John had brought out the Greek god s beneficent aspect, Johns association with Dionysos restores to him his powers as an agent of change. By emphasizing Johns "daimonic"95 force and provocatively identifying him with Jesus, Harrison challenges the deathly luminosity of the Christian God, who has become a rationalized and thus non-religious fabrication like the despised "anthropomorphic Olympians." The article thus transforms John Baptist into a Dionysian force for Harrison s own time. Encompassing both the self-sacrificial fervor of John96 and the epiphanic triumph of Dionysos, Harrison s daimon reinhabits the Gospels to shock and thus to revitalize a scholarship "fading and dying" of its own "limitations and crystallizations."97 If the composite daimon of Dionysos-John Baptist is the totem of Harri- sons religion of the unknown, the Greek language is the clay of its creation. As the shared language of sacred and secular texts, Greek naturally spans that dangerous liminal space between scholarship and sacrilege. Its commonality in Euripides, the Gospels, and Apocryphal manuscripts enables the analogies that justify the "life-history" of the year-daimon and allows Harrison to break through the barriers between Christian and pagan belief. Her adaptation of Greek as the language of her own religion of scholarly mysticism is exemplified</page><page sequence="21">150 Journal of Modem Literature in her John article by a citation of an obscure Greek passage in an eleventh- century manuscript. She confesses: "The words are not very easy to translate, for we have no exact equivalent for thriambeutheinau The untranslatable phrase leads her to conclude that "a triumphal dance with the head seems almost implied" and thus to link Salome's dance with Agave s and both with the daimon's life-history. The unknowability of the Greek here allows Harrison to venture across the barrier between pagan and Christian texts and to justify the use of her own sympathetic imagination as an instrument of scholarly inter- rogation. James's correction of her grammar identifies the narrative impulse behind Harrisons treatment of Greek. " Thriambeuo is surely not a very hard word to render," he writes. "[I]n the active it means to lead in triumph, ... in the passive, to be led in triumph, or to be triumphed over." Jamess demagogic tone suggests that Harrison s inability to construe is due not to the obscurity of the passage but either to Harrison's inadequate linguistic expertise or to an ail- too suggestible narrative imagination. "[C]an Miss Harrison point to any docu- ment earlier than the nineteenth century in which the princess is represented as being enamoured of John?" queries James. "And again, if it is so, 'to speak of the love of Salome for the Baptist is to put the loathsome performances of Flaubert and Oscar Wilde in place of the Gospel story.'" By pointing out Harrison's indiscriminate amalgam of primitive myth and modern fiction, James recasts the accusation of "amorous license" from the Biblical narrative to the irrespon- sible, morally dubious exegete. His defense of the Gospels' sovereignty firmly resituates the blame of licentiousness on Harrison's own romanticizations. The accusation, however, is ironically double-sided. For while his quotation marks attribute the mention of Flaubert and Wilde98 to Harrison, the latter makes no direct mention of either author. It is James himself who makes the explicit association with Salaambo and Salome . This may be a small technical slip but it is a telling one. If James's criticism centers around Harrison's over-facile blend of history and fiction, the slip of his own pen here - not to mention his reading of Euripides - demonstrates just how fluid are the boundaries between Gospel truth and narrative invention. Challenging these boundaries, Harrison's use of Greek might very well warrant the Cambridge Review's claim that "while Miss Jane Harrison, not Salome, leads the dance; no doubt the walls of Jericho (if not already down) are showing some more cracks."99 5 ******* In conceiving the Eniautos-Daimon, Harrison not only invented a god and spearheaded a school of thought. She also shaped a critical rhetoric that had to recognize and contend with the instability of discursive boundaries and by doing so contribute to Harrison's fight for scholarship in the face of seemingly greater catastrophes. Unlike the European war, Harrison's was a battle whose goal was not the victory of one side or the other but the perpetuation of conflict</page><page sequence="22">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 151 itself as vital fuel for what James called the "fire of education, religion, learn- ing and research." The two published responses to James's article100 emphasize the obscurity of victory when the battle-lines seem to dissolve in the fighting. Harrisons letter was, as she herself purported, "a polite, formal acknowledg- ment of my errors."101 The acknowledgment was short, falsely deferential, and pointedly curmudgeonly. "I should like to thank Dr. James for his kind - if not too kindly - correction of my inaccuracies," she begins. "'Apocryphal Scrip- tures' and 'late Byzantine legends' are to me new seas into which I am but just plunging, so I am doubly grateful to be set right at the outset." Having paid due homage to the superior knowledge of the provost, who was twelve years her junior, Harrison comes to the main point of her letter: The details in which he is good enough to correct me nowise invalidate, or even affect, my argument ... I propose, therefore, to continue unabashed my crude and inconsequent speculations.' As to the general desirability of Comparative Mythology as a subject for students, I would leave that question in hands more judicious than my own. I am no educationalist. To me the keenest joys of science - as of sport - are always perilous, and I hope to die commending perilous joys to a generation better equipped, and I trust more valorous, than my own. Harrison brandishes here a dramatic combat rhetoric with the rebellious glee of Dionysos and the self-sacrificial fervor of the martyr-saint, willing to die for her beliefs.102 Playing up the roles of soldier and victim, she loads her defense with an insistent self-referentiality that draws attention to James's inappropriate per- sonal attacks. Meanwhile, her language casts the fighting spirit of experimental science in a heroic light that implicitly identifies James as an over-scrupulous Pentheus whose unsporting cowardice is as much a threat of intellectual degen- eracy as the "premature handling" of a "science in the making."103 Harrison's letter to Gilbert Murray, shortly after she read James's diatribe, emphasizes that she was less concerned about the fate of her poor Baptist than about maintaining the intensity of her sport. " Please . . . will you look at the Provost's outbreak over the Head of John Baptist - I knew somebody wld rage and swell. ..." she wrote, confessing to full precognizance of the objections her article would ignite and suggesting that provocation was at least half the goal. "You can say J.B.'s head is all nonsense if you like - tho it isn't! ... If you haven't time for all please readjust the end of the Provost's article - and please answer it, it really affects the Humanities."104 Murray responded by writing a companion letter to Harrison's that argued both on her behalf and on behalf of the "Humanities." At this point, Murray was not only a well-known Hel- lenist but a prominent figure in matters of national education. He had joined the National Board of Education in 1916 and been proposed as Education Minister. In addition to his qualifications on the educational front, Murray's</page><page sequence="23">152 Journal of Modem Literature authority on the texts involved in the debate rested, in part, on his position as Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford and his contributions to the Biblical Encyclopaedia on the philosophical background of the New Testament. The tone of his letter was diplomatic, but, as Harrison wrote to him afterwards, "you have pierced to the Provosts real motive - it is a general attack, though levelled at me."105 '"Very outspoken criticism' may no doubt at times be desir- able, but I cannot see that the errors of fact or faults of method which the Provost of Kings has pointed out in Miss Harrisons article ... are sufficient to justify the tone of his condemnation," Murray s letter begins, pointing out the discrepancy between Jamess personal hostility and the requisite objectivity of "fact" and "method" his article purports to defend. Clearly, if James wanted to argue on grounds of professionalism and scholarly conduct, Harrison could find a champion to defend her position without sacrificing her own composure in counter-attack.106 Murray, however, was far more than an auxiliary arms-bearer for Har- rison or an apologist for "premature sciences." Though Harrison may have felt compelled to speak only for herself, Murray set out to prove more generally and as an "educationalist" that the "perilous joy" of the sympathetic imagination can - and must - coexist with philological scruples. [There are] two passages of Greek, where the Provost differs from her. But here, I must confess, her interpretation seems to me to be probably right, and certainly defensible. ... I should precisely agree with Miss Harrison that a 'triumphal dance with the head seems almost implied/ Observe the almost.' Hie Provost wants it to mean was exposed in triumph' . . . Quite possible; though unlikely in point of language. And surely unnecessary in view of the passage quoted by the Provost himself. While engaging the linguistic technicality insisted on by the Provost, Murray s defense of Harrison also argues that translation - especially of an ancient lan- guage - is inherently an act of interpretation. Meaning stems as much from context and implication as from precise lexicographic rendering; it is guided as much by narrative possibility as by the certainties of "fact" and "method." Indeed, Jamess seemingly authoritative translation is, Murray points out, as much a function of what he "wants" it to mean as Harrisons is a reading based "on her own facts." At least Miss Harrison has the self-awareness and humil- ity to admit an "almost" into her reading while the Provosts translation errs more self-damningly on the side of pomp and superfluity. Whatever linguistic superiority James wanted to assert has thus not only been summarily squelched by a specialist whose credentials trump his own but been exposed as a rhetorical pretension that discredits his scholarly objectivity and defense of institutional dignity. Murray was not the kind of person who would pull rank, however. His letter sincerely questions the authority of those who supposedly have earned</page><page sequence="24">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 153 the "name and dignity" to pronounce judgment on "fields with which [they are not] at all specially familiar." The weakness of James s defensive offense becomes more clear when Murray turns to address the contentious issue of Salome s supposed desire for John. "It had never occurred to me that any student of mythology would so interpret Miss Harrisons argument," writes Murray, sug- gesting that the idea of Salomes lust for John stemmed not from any confusion on Harrison s part between history, the Gospel, and modern fiction but from the biases of a man so foreign to "the surroundings and idioms" of mythol- ogy - or so eager to adopt a mythological mindset - as to allow for the complete reduction of historical fact to imaginative conception. He evidently thinks Miss Harrison has said something both paradoxical and offensive, something which justified him in using every art of polemic to destroy so noxious a view. I believe he imagines - though I hesitate to ascribe such a view to him, and offer him sincere apologies if I am wrong - that Miss Harrison means that John the Baptist was a Year-daemon and not a historical person; or, even more strangely, that, to quote his own words: 'There were love passages between Herodias' daughter and St. John (on her side only) and that when she was repulsed the motive spretae iniuria formae came into play, and she demanded Johns head out of spite." Whether or not Harrison did indeed want to challenge the historicity of Biblical persona, Murray's argument stresses that the faults of offensiveness and paradox lie as much with James as with Harrison. In fact, he completely reverses the indictment of trespass. James, who willingly admits his own igno- rance of comparative mythology, has no right to criticize its ways - indeed, risks his own values of conduct and integrity when he does so. For not only does his attack present itself as unprofessional but his misreading of Harrison s article exposes both his unfamiliarity with the conventions of myth criticism and an imagination that seems all too eager to collapse a Biblical persona into a linguistic conjunction that Harrison has elsewhere identified as her own rhetorical invention. Could James be shadow-boxing against his own "noxious" inclinations to move from historical to mythological personas?107 This implicit question surfaces when Murray states that though ""Miss Harrison never sug- gested that the Gospel story itself is derived from the Year-myth ... I do not for a moment mean to imply that a scholar should be debarred from making such a suggestion, if the argument seemed to him to lead that way." Such an extension of the year-myth to modern narrative certainly does seem likely in James' case since the explicit juxtaposition of Wilde s dramatic re-telling with the Biblical tale appears not in Harrison's article but in James' - a point Murray is careful to emphasize in his use of direct quotation. Murray's article uses James' misreading of Harrison to expose the provost's own imaginative inclinations and, by doing so, suggests that comparative mythologists' approach to antiquity not only constitutes a legitimate method</page><page sequence="25">154 Journal of Modem Literature of historical inquiry but might serve as a model for modern scholarship. While Murray might acknowledge the specialized discourse of each disciplinary field, his counter-indictment of James also recognizes the impossibility of confin- ing knowledge within rational, objective boundaries or judging it according to institutional hierarchies. By implicating James in the flights of personal fancy James denounces in Harrison, Murray points out the impracticability of rigid discriminations between legitimate and illegitimate knowledge. His final remarks directly question Jamess assumption of insider privilege. If we mythologists are to blame for the excessive hostility which we seem to arouse, I venture to suggest that it is chiefly not for the reasons alleged by the Provost, but for a quite different one. It may be true that, like other groups of inquirers, we sometimes fall into a sort of shorthand language which is perfectly intelligible to other mythologists, but is apt to be misinterpreted by outsiders. If that is so, it looks as if we and our readers both ought to be more careful. By defending the right of mythologists to cultivate their own "shorthand lan- guage/' Murray emphasizes the formation of new boundaries between splin- tering disciplinary fields and challenges those who would deny multiplicity of perspective to any field of inquiry. There is no longer one inside or one outside but rather multiple interiorities. A single concept of "scientific dignity" can no longer assert proprietary authority over all forms of knowledge. Indeed, the principles of comparative mythology assume applicability to scholarship in gen- eral precisely because they emphasize the fluidity of the boundaries that control the relationships between scholars and their subjects and between scholars in different fields. Fields of knowledge are fertilized by the processes of recep- tion and projection, of reading and misreading that guarantee the continuing vitality of the university. Harrison herself expressed this view in her 1913 essay "Scientiae Sacra Fames": Science today is . . . more co-operative, more democratic. The several depart- ments, once sharply sundered, now work in conjunction; there is a sense of the whole towards which each is tending. A University that used to be split into faculties is now - though specialization is intenser than ever - conscious of its unity, its interrelations. That consciousness may yet save our older Universities, spiritually moribund though they are.108 Such a vision of institutional unity seems at first hopelessly idealistic given the territorial squabblings between specializations. But for Harrison, these territorial disputes are the keenest evidence of the growing consciousness of inter-relations. She believed that continuing debates about the significance of the ancient world would ensure not only the survival of classics as a modern discipline but the vibrancy of all fields of learning. In the twenty-first cen- tury, the increase in interdisciplinary work and the constant interface between</page><page sequence="26">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 155 scholarship and popular culture multiply opportunities for contest and debate over the meaning and validity of classics. Whether they are between liberals and conservatives, feminists and anti-feminists, or Homer and Hollywood, these debates witness the continuing passion with which individuals are will- ing to defend their beliefs and ensure the vitality of classics as a field of study, of battle, of sport, and of play.

The term "liberal education" was coined by John Henry Newman in The Idea of a University (1852). 5. I mean by "modern discipline" a classical field that includes multiple branches of study, including archaeology, art history, and religion, rather than the exclusive literary-linguistic study of the early nineteenth century. 6. Because she was caught in the century- straddling breakdown of one set of academic principles and the development of another, Harrison has been hard to categorize according to any historical continuum. The absence of much reliable primary testimony to her life has complicated biographical efforts. Mary Beard has articulated these difficulties in her book The Invention of Jane Harrison (Cam- bridge: Harvard UP, 2000). "Inevitably the Harrison story ... is a loaded story, a carefully selected, edited, and narrativized version of a life, told and retold by those . . . with a stake in its telling [B]y adding to the story of Harrison, I am trying to expose it all the more clearly as a story, ; not as a real life' (recoverable by careful historical effort), but as a series of competing narratives, a battleground of biography" (11). Annabel Robinson's most recent biography of Harrison ironically confirms Beard's depiction of a "battleground of biography" by arguing against her that Harrison's life is determinable. She writes in her introduction that "a coherent person does indeed emerge" from the collections of letters and testimonies remaining to researchers. Annabel Robinson, The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison (Oxford UP, 2002) 6. Previous to Robinson's straightforward biography, this concept of a "real" Jane Harrison has indeed been difficult to accept as critics have tried to embellish the sketchy details of Harrison's life in order to validate a larger historical narrative. The psycholanalytic approach used by Sandra Peacock's Jane Ellen Harrison: the Mask and the Self (New Haven: Yale UP, 1988) credits much of Harrison's work as a scholar to a childhood that reads like a Victorian bildungsroman' raised by a governess-turned step-mother and a father who resented her for the death of his first wife, Harrison was sent off to boarding school where she had an ultimately disappointing transference encounter with the head-mistress. Harrison's personal writings reveal that there is likely truth in Peacock's assertion that "the experience with a stepfamily . . . influenced Jane's perceptions of family in general . . . and she projected her ideas about family life back into the ancient world through her scholarly work" (14). But Harrison's self-projection into the ancient past exceeds any psychoanalytic framework imposed by Peacock, whose dramatization of Harrison's Oedipal angst and speculative assertions about the dysfunctional family romance in the Harrison household often flounder, if grandly, in the lack of substantial evidence. In contrast to Peacock's tendency toward excess, Martha Carpentieri 1998 Rituály Myth, and the Modernist Text: the Influence of Jane Ellen Harrison on Joyce, Eliot, and Woolf (Netherlands: Gordon and Breach Publishers, 1998) deals with the obscurity of Harrison's life by avoiding direct discussion of her altogether, choosing instead to use her work as a tenuous connection</page><page sequence="27">156 Journal of Modem Literature between mid to late Victorian mythological theory and high Modernist literary classicism. The first half of the book focuses on a history of anthropology in the nineteenth-century and, in keeping with the work of historian Robert Ackerman, locates Harrison at the tail end of a scholarly line including E.B. Tylor, Andrew Lang, and J.G. Frazer. (See Robert Ac ker man's The Cambridge Group and the Origins of Myth Criticism (Ann Arbor: UMI, 1980) and his The Myth and Ritual School : J.G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists. (New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1991). The book then jumps rather abruptly to literary analyses of Carpentieri three major literary figures, constructing a rather tenuous link between them. Woolf was a friend of Harrison's in the latter's later life, but Harrison's actual influence on Joyce and Eliot is based largely on Carpentier's own speculations. If anything, her jump from scientific history to fictional analysis begs the question of Harrison's role in mediating between the "anthropological method" of myth interpretation and the conscious adoption of a myth-making mentality into the modern literary imagination. 7.

Cambridge did not officially grant membership to women until 1948, although by 1926, they were already actively involved in teaching, examining, and research. For full historical account of women students in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries Cambridge, see Rita McWilliams-Tullberg's Women at Cambridge (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1998). 9. Technically, "pure scholarship" at Cambridge meant rigorous linguistic and grammatical analysis of texts as opposed to a broader literary-interpretive approach at Oxford. Christopher Stray writes: "Cambridge presented an obvious contrast to Oxford, where a very different style of classical scholar- ship prevailed in the 1860s [i.e., before reforms to the classical curricula of both schools were proposed in earnest.] . . . The Oxford style . . . constituted a high-profile public discourse which encouraged the conscious creation of Platonic guardians for Britain and its empire. . . . Cambridge . . . focused much more on the close linguistic analysis of texts, and made no large claims to a wider cultural reso- nance." Christopher Stray, Classics Transformed: Schools , Universities , and Society in England, 1830-1960 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998) 121-2. 10. Harrison first comprehensively defined the "sympathetic imagination" in her Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (PS GR) (1903) as the critical faculty that allows moderns to "think back [to the] haze of the early morning [of mankind] ... a protoplasmic fulness and forcefulness not yet articulate into the diverse forms of its ultimate births." PSGR (New York: Meridian, 1955) 164. 11. In her approach to ancient Greece, Harrison calls forth the image of the critic as "Romantic hero," described by Jean-Pierre Mileur in The Critical Romance: The Critic as Reader, Writer ; Hero (Wisconsin UP, 1990). According to Mileur, criticism is the heir of and a genre within the Romantic literary tradition. The critic participates in an "internalized quest-romance" whose "ideal goal is a form of self-consciousness to remedy the ailment of self-consciousness . . . The critic himself (like the quester, the priest, the hero) is a liminal and ambiguous figure, at once exiled and exalted. . . . He is held in contempt yet is possessed of an extraordinary and dangerous freedom, which he both exercises and struggles to subdue" (43). As we will see, the institutional circumstances of Harrison's time set the stage for the quest-romance of her career. 12.

RSL 82-3. The "gates of learning" were in fact opening up for women at this time. When Har- rison went to the Cheltenham's Ladies' College in 1867, the School Inspection Commission (a.k.a. the Taunton Commission) publicly recognized the deplorable condition of girls' public schools and two years later prompted the Endowed Schools Act which allotted money to girls' schools for their improvement. Although Cheltenham was a devout evangelical institution guided by the same reli- gious strictures as Harrison's childhood home, it was also committed to providing its students with a grammar school education equal to that of boys' and was known as a model girls' grammar school by a public increasingly attentive to the state of girls' education. Its principal, Miss Dorothea Beale, was one of the women who helped Emily Davies launch Girton, the first university-level women's college that, by its opening in 1869, provided an answer to the nagging five-year old question: to what end were girls being admitted to Local University Examinations? 20. The Cambridge Tripos Examinations were the tests male students needed to pass to receive an honours degree in their field. Since women were not members of the University and could not receive degrees, many did not even consider taking the exams when they went up to Cambridge and those who did sit them before 1881 did so informally, before private examiners. The arrangement of these private examinations caused considerable anxiety. One student wrote of her experience as a student in 1871, "The Cambridge Lectures for women were founded to prepare women for the Higher Local Examination and the first students came up to attend these lectures and it was not till the second term of their residence that the idea of going through the regular course of preparation for a Tripos, and endeavouring to obtain an informal examination took shape in their minds, whatever may have been the intentions of the founders. Then came the long period of preparation with all the delightful uncertainties for our Students as to the precise standard required by the University, and finally the awful doubt, which indeed recurred many times under the 'informal system,' whether, after all their years of preparation the examiners would consent to examine them." Newnham College Roll Letter 1883 (Newnham College Archives, Cambridge) 4. In 1881, the University formally admitted women into both the previous and Tripos examinations, and the women received a certificate for passing. When Harrison sat her Classical Tripos in 1879, the examination consisted of 14 three-hour "papers" (i.e., tests) scattered over eight days in a week and a half period. In 1880, the year after Harrison sat her Tripos, the Classical Tripos was divided into two parts. Part II was optional but could only be taken after satisfactory completion of Part I. Part I still focused on translation and composition. Part II still required translation and composition (A) but then allowed students to choose one or two special areas of focus: ancient philosophy (B), history (C), archaeology (D) or language (E). (i Cambridge University Reporter March 11, 1879, 435). Taking the undivided Tripos, Harrison was top of the second but as Robinson states "it was a bitter, bitter disappointment" (Robinson 53). 21. Margaret Merrifield (a.k.a. May Verrall) would remain one of Harrison's closest friends through- out her life. May Verrall 's own recollection of learning Greek at Newnham in the late 1870's gives an indication of how women students were regarded by the lecturers who came to teach them from the men's colleges: "I have succeeded in 'humbugging' Mr Archer Hind so that he does not dream of dismissing me to the other class, on the contrary he treats me with grea respect, always asks my opinion of a difficult passage, etc. The other day I was bold enough to strike out a new idea. . . . He [Archer Hind] was very much interested when he heard my idea was original, and said it was a very good one. At first he seemed disposed to adopt it, but finally he said that the ordinary interpretation was perhaps more in accordance with Aeschylean ideas, tho' one might bear mine in mind, wasn't that a triumph. After learning Greek about two months, to strike out a new interpretation of the Agamemnon and be told that it was a good one! Shan't I get conceited." Ann Phillips, ed. A Newnham Anthology (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1979) 8. 22. During the 20 years away from Newnham, Harrison studied archaeology at the British Museum, travelled to Germany, Italy and Greece for her research, lectured on Greek art and archaeology, and published numerous articles and three books. Her friends and acquaintances included: Mary Kingsley, Robert Browning, Walter Pater and his sisters, Henryjames, Herbert Spencer, Walter Raleigh, Elea- nor Tennyson (who took Harrison to see her father-in-law Alfred Lord Tennyson), Mabel Malleson</page><page sequence="29">158 Journal of Modem Literature (close friend and neighbor of George Eliot and George Lewes), and Virginia and Leonard Woolf.

Harrison was offered a research fellowship at Newnham in 1898 which allowed her plenty of time for her own writing and research and did not require her to take on the teaching and tutorial obligations that other staff had. This was due largely to the considerable reputation she had already built. See Robinson 122ff. 28. Harrison had immense respect for Dörpfeld, who in 1888 was excavating the Acropolis for the German Archaeological Institute, and they remained correspondents and friends throughout Harrison s life. 29. This book was recommended reading for the Part II, Section D, paper 2 of the Classical Tripos in 1900 (i Cambridge University Reporter March 15, 1898, University Library, Cambridge). 30.

"[Greek art is not to be] approached on merely aesthetic grounds," Harrison wrote in an article for the Magazine of Art in 1884. "[T]he modern mind is not content with contemplation. [T]he student must learn not only to perceive but to discern; not only to contemplate but to classify. He must above all seek out the beginnings of things, the cause, the sequence, the consummation, even the close. ... It is this scientific basis as a condition and confirmation of aesthetic verdicts that the modern mind imperatively demands."

Among the comments made by the Classical Review (by W.H.D. Rouse) are: "[There are] several suggestions which seem more fanciful than true" (466); "Miss Harrison's derivations are often fanciful, and misleading, yet the general presentation of the facts [of a particular feast] ... is excellent" (467); "[S]he acknowledges herself [that] the processes are not clear: links are wanting in the chain, and the reader is left with the feeling that there is too much assumption" (468).

The Classical Review was founded in 1887 with the expansion of the Cambridge classical curricu- lum (e.g., into specialties of art and archaeology). In Classics Transformed: Schools , Universities , and Society in England , 1830-1960 , Christopher Stray gives an idea of the journal's broad range of audience: "Among the benefits [The Classical Review's] editors envisaged . . . were: that scholars would no longer work in the dark; that schoolmasters would learn what to recommend to their pupils [i.e., through the journal's book reviews]; unproductive scholars would be encouraged to write; the antagonists of classics would see that the subject meant more than writing verses in a dead language ... ; that an organ of international communication between scholars would be provided" (135). 46.

The Eniautos-Daimon catalyzed the kind of revolt against familiar categories and knowledge that Harrison had intended to provoke. The Daimon became the conceptual center of the group that came to be known as "The Cambridge Ritualists." Gilbert Murray and F.M. Cornford, the two other "Ritualists" besides Harrison, contributed chapters to Themis , taking the familiar forms of tragedy and the Olympic Games and "daemonizing" them out of recognition. J.A.K. Thomson's Studies in the Odysseyy A.B. Cook's Zeus and Murray's own Hamlet and Orestes: a Study in Traditional Types followed in the next three years. All of these familiar title figures (i.e., Odysseus, Zeus, Hamlet and Orestes) are interpreted by their authors, either directly or indirectly, as representatives of the Eniautos-Daimon. 51. The mutually reinforcing relationship between Britain's two oldest universities and the Anglican Church was foremost among the values underpinning the ideal of classical scholarship throughout most of the nineteenth century. As Christopher Stray remarks in his introduction to Classics in 19th and 20th Century Cambridge: Curriculum , Culture and Community , "Oxford and Cambridge were the educational wings of the Established Church" (3). One of the primary functions of a classical educa- tion at Oxford and Cambridge was to prepare the nation's religious leaders. Michael Sanderson notes that 62% of Cambridge students and 64.2% of Oxford students went into the Church between 1752 and 1886. It was not until the 1871 Universities Tests Acts that dons at Oxford and Cambridge could be excused from taking Holy Orders, and Dissenters were permitted to take degrees and fellowships. Michael Sanderson, The Universities in the Nineteenth Century (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975) 142. By the end of the nineteenth century, the bond between the church and the university had weakened due to the increasing availability of secular professions and the subsequent expansion</page><page sequence="31">160 Journal of Modem Literature of the university curriculum. However, the fact that knowing Greek provided direct access to the word of God in the New Testament ensured a lasting bond between Greek scholarship and the Anglican Church. The importance of Christian faith became more pressing during the war years when adherence to the protestant church was promoted as a bounden duty of British citizens. 52.

Cambridge Review Vol. 38 (1916) 98. T.R. Glover was lecturer of Ancient History at Cambridge and Fellow of St.John's College at the time. In June of 1917, Glover was appointed Wilde Lecturer in Natural and Comparative Religion at Oxford. The Cambridge Review states of the first lecture at Cam- bridge on "Jesus as a Historical Personality": "Mr. Glover dealt a shrewd knock at some modern writers when he declared that the history of the Gospels could only tested by men with some knowledge and experience of such document . . . and not every person has a right to form an opinion on the matter." The lectures could not have failed to catch Harrison's attention. The Cambridge Review notes: "Mr. Glover has completely filled the lecture theatre week after week, and we do not remember a course of lectures which has been followed with such rapt attention and steady enthusiasm" (Dec. 2, 1916) 139. In his book The Jesus of History (London: Student Christian Movement, 1917) from which these lectures were excerpted, Glover states: "Even the daemons [of ancient religion] they [i.e. Christians] dismissed to irrelevance and non-entity. . . . [Christians] put the daemons into their right place, and by and by they vanished, dropped out, did of sheer inanity and neglect. Wherever Jesus Christ has been, the daemons have gone" (216). The series of lectures at Cambridge also included a detailed discussion of the difference between John Baptist and Christ. See further discussion of Glover's lectures below. See The Jesus of History chapter 7 and the Cambridge Review Vol. 38 (Nov. 25, 1916). 62. See J.H. Holden's The World and the Gospel (1916). This was reviewed in the Cambridge Review Vol. 38 (Dec. 6, 1916): [The book paints the] now familiar picture of the war as a judgment of a diseased society ... a reminder that a society based on selfishness must in the end destroy itself" (132). 63. The question of what did and did not count as dignified knowledge took on particular weight in the area of Greek scholarship, which was already fraught with contention at Cambridge, in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The importance of Greek as a marker of university intellectual tradi- tions is set out in The "Compulsory Greek Debates" which began in 1870 at Cambridge. Briefly, the</page><page sequence="32">Harrison and the Afterlife of Languages 161 debates had to do with whether Greek should be a required subject in the Previous Examinations or "Little-Go," which undergraduate men had to pass in order to take either the Tripos Examination (for an honours degree) or a Poll Examination (for an ordinary degree). Debates about compulsory Greek continued throughout the years of the war, but they took on a self-reflexiveness that began to question their own relevancy in light of larger world problems. Whenever the question of keeping Greek in the Previous Examinations came up for discussion during the war years, letters of protest show up in the Cambridge Review , arguing that "obsolete mid-Victorian liberals" were taking advantage of the depleted student body "to rivet their shackles upon the University ... in the absence of the younger men of all shades of opinion." Cambridge Review Vol. 37 (1915-1916) 342. In specific reference to the relationship between the debates and WWI, Judith Raphaely states: "Like much else, Compulsory Greek was a casualty of [WWI]. ... In the month that the peace conference met at Versailles, the question of Compulsory Greek was no longer one of the central issues of the day." Judith Raphaely, "Nothing But Gibberish and Shibboleths?: The Compulsory Greek Debates, 1870-1919" (in Stray 1999, 71-94) 93. 64. MRJ to GVC 19 April 1917. (King's College Archives). MRJ also mentioned re-reading the Bac- chae in a letter to his friend Gwen McBryde, stating "My mind has been improved since I left you by the reading of 3 Greek plays in the train . . ." (23 April, 1917 Letters to a Friend , King's College Archives). The repetitive mention of this reading experience seems to indicate the persistence MRJ's thoughts about the issues it raises for him. Verrall was a classicist at Cambridge with a special interest in Euripides. He was also the first professor of English in the university as well as a teacher, mentor and friend of Harrison's. MRJ was correct about Verrall's sympathy with Pentheus. In an 1911 review of A.W. Verrall's The Bacchants of Euripides and Other Essays m the Classical Review , Cyril Bailey states the following: ". . . for the band of true Euripideans [according to Verrall] . . . the play had a meaning very different from its face-value. For these it was not a support of the Dionysiac religion, but a very damaging onslaught upon it. . . . the main action of the play is designed to show not only the immo- rality and cruelty of the Dionysus legend, but the evil effects of the Bacchic enthusiasm. Dionysus is not the suffering but ultimately victorious hero, comparable, as Professor Murray's translation not infrequently hints, to the figure of Christ, but a not over- scrupulous fanatic . . . Dr. Verrall takes as typical of the traditional interpretation Professor Murray's translation, and shows, to my mind effectively, how, in order to support it, it has been necessary for him in many places to 'heighten' the language, and lift it into a plane of mysticism and exaltation, which a straightforward interpretation of the text will not bear" (142). 65. James would almost definitely have been reading the plays in the original Greek. 66. PSGR 444-6. 67. In her preface to the second edition (1927) of her 1912 book Themis , Harrison admits to being a "disciple of Nietzche," but admits "I ought never to have forgotten that humanity needs not only the intoxication of Dionysos the daimon (who is the escape into the suffering will behind phenomena), but also, and perhaps even more, that 'appeasement in form' which is Apollo the Olympian" ( Themis viii). 68.

Frazer also discusses the Dionysian ritual of rending an animal to pieces in a re-enactment of the myth of Dionysos's murder in the shape of a bull by his enemies the Titans. See chapter 15, "Dionysus" in The Golden Bough (1890). This myth has been the foundation of later (post-Harrison) criticism link- ing Dionysos's death to the sacrament of Christ. See Jan Kotťs The Eating of the Gods: An Interpretation of Greek Tragedy (1970), Park McGinty's Interpretation and Dionysos : Method in the Study of a God (1978) and Arthur Evans's The God of Ecstasy : Sex-Roles and the Madness of Dionysos (1988). 71.

Dionysos was ripped to pieces by the Titans and resurrected by Rhea. He is also the "twice-born" god - killed along with his mother Semeie by Zeus-as-thunderbolt, and then sewn up in Zeus's thigh to be re-born. 76. Orpheus, like Dionysos, was killed and, to some extent, resurrected. After being torn apart by Maenads, Orpheus's severed head floated to Lesbos where it was honored as an oracle. 77. See lines 231ff in Bacchae. James's sympathies would have been contrary to popular interpreta- tions of the play at the time, which saw Pentheus as rightly punished for his resistance to Dionysian forces. 78. MRJ's sense of purposelessness and despair surfaces in letters of 1916-1917 to Gordon Carey (King's College Archives). A subtle but poignant passage refers to his digging trenches for potatoes (April 19, 1917): "I have dug trenches in the ground, in which potatoes were placed. Much depends upon the way in which this is done, as you hardly need to be told, &amp; I think I have the right to say that - well, I don't want to claim more than I ought." 79.

The full quote reads: "[Rjitual deadens the intellect and stimulates will, desire, emotion. ... It is this personal experience (sic), this exaltation, this sense of immediate, non-intellectual revelation, of mystical oneness with all things, that again and again rehabilitates a ritual otherwise moribund" (176) Note Harrison's emphasis on the term "experience" here. Deeply influenced by her reading of Henri Bergson and Emile Durkheim at the time, Harrison's interpretation of religion focuses on the abstraction of the individual being into the universal life principle. Here, the importance of ritual experience lies in the melding of the "personal" into the collective and universal. 81. Cambridge Review (Nov. 29, 1917). 163-165. 82.

Interestingly, one of James's sermons during this time addressed the difference between John Baptist and Christ. The sermon is written in pencil on scrap paper and dated Thursday 25 November 1917 (Manuscripts Room, Cambridge University Library. Box Add. 7485 Sermons.) Part of it reads: "Some people in all ages have felt that in order to have their eyes rightly fixed upon God they must shut them to everything else. And they have ... led a life apart, looking upon everything that connected them with their world as a temptation. . . . But I observe that Jesus did not countenance that view of life.

John came neither eating nor drinking - John was an ascetic - and you said he was mad. I am not an ascetic - the Son of man is seen eating and drinking . . . life was not all joy, still less all enjoyment to Him . . .

The debate about whether the Baptist ought to be regarded as a prophet of the Old Testament or an initiator of the new order is an old one and was being carried on at this time in Cambridge T.R. Glover's lectures had forceably argued Jesus's uniqueness as the hero of the New Testament, claiming that "whatever may be the historical connexion between [John Baptist and Jesus], it is important for us ... to realize the broad gulf that separates them" (Glover, The Jesus of History 149). The Cambridge Review indicates that the discussion of John vs. Jesus was discussed in the Cambridge lectures. 93. "I have been in the depth of depression - no one seemed to feel the Horned Horror [her Minotaur article] had any significance," she wrote. "[William] Ridgeway openly insulting.

It is worth noting that Jesus states in Luke that John "had a devil" (Luke vii. 33). 96. Harrison's risky article in some ways fulfills a dream of martyrdom that she had proposed only half-ironically as a resolution to the war. JEH to GGM (Nov. 1914): "[S]omehow to me [martyrdom] makes a supreme appeal that nothing else does What I feel we ought to have done - down in my deepest heart - was to have marched out all of us to meet the German army and said we withstand you - shoot us down if you wish.' I wonder if they wld have done it. hasn't the unarmed man who is ready to die for his faith some terrific power? even over Germans" ( JH Archives Box 4). The attitude of the martyr was, according to her student and friend Victoria de Bunsen, a part of Harrison's spiritual make-up: "I recall . . . how she would suddenly drop from the ironical to the very serious, and express things . . . that revealed the spiritual sources of her own life, of the peace that comes from facing trial or suffering - standing up to it, not running away - of letting it become a part of one's life - the most sacred part; of sacrifice - that it was essential to spiritual attainment . . ."

Then, after reading Murray's letter, she wrote: "Yr screed leaves me free just to write a polite formal acknowledgment of my errors and to thank him for pointing them out. . . . [I]f there wasn't you to defend me I should get enraged and scarified, and now I feel as full of Christian love and charity as a lamb unborn" (JEH to GGM Feb. 1917, JH Archives Box 4). 107. M.R. James was, of course, more well known as a ghost-story writer than as a medievalist, a cataloguer of library and museum collections, a provost, a Vice- Chancellor, or any of his other numer- ous titles. His first volume of stories - Ghost Stories of an Antiquary - was published in the same year (1903) as Harrison's first Prolegomena. The two publications - both dealing with ghosts, spirits, and fear reveal a curious compatibility between Harrison's and James's superstitious natures, despite their apparently opposing religious views. "If there be ghosts," wrote James in a 1929 article of ghost stories "as I am quite prepared to believe - the true ghost story need do no more than illustrate their normal habits" ( Casting the Runes and Other Ghost Stories (New York: Oxford UP, 1998) 349). Michael Cox notes, "James always implicitly denied that his stories were anything more than the products of idle moments" {Casting the Runes xxi). But biographical facts suggest James's deeper conviction in the world of the unseen. Cox writes: "The retributive imagery of the Middle Ages - the remorseless demons and gaping hell mouths - fascinated him intellectually and imaginatively, as did the eschatology of New Testament apocrypha, on which the medieval imagery was largely based. He recognized that lifelong fascination with these subjects was out of the common, even describing it in the language of psychoanalysis as 'a complex'" ( Casting the Runes xiii). 108."Scientiae Sacra Fames" 136.</page></plain_text>
