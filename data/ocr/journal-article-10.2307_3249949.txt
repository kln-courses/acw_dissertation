<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDREW L. COHEN WHY A HISTORY OF MONUMENTS FROM NOLAMBAVADI N o!ambavadi is the historical regional name of territories controlled by the No!amba dynasty from the late eighth to early eleventh centuries. Encompassing present day southeast Karna- taka and contiguous portions of Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu at its height, No!ambavadi has temple architecture and sculpture that warrant inclusion in art historical accounts but have received scant review. During my research on monuments it became necessary for me to question why most historians of Indian art assign antiquities from large dynastic regions as central (i.e., superior) and, following typical assumptions of binary oppositions, assign antiquities from other regions as peri- pheral (i.e., inferior).' When discussed, Nolamba2 monuments are presented as provincial copies of the more central works of the Deccan tradition, that is, those of Ca!ukyas, Rastrakutas, or the southern Pallava and Cola traditions; or, as a combination of influences from these larger nearby traditions. Sivarama- murti's catalogue of sculptures from Hemavati (Andhra Pradesh, the No!amba capital) at the Madras Government Museum is the best known study on No!amba art.3 According to Sivaramamurti, No!amba art is essentially a copying of the Ca!ukya style with some Pallava elements added.4 A "distinctiveness" or "charm" is conceded, but not defined. In order to particularize Nolamba period art he identifies the elements that are derived from greater (better known) dynasties, "The peculiar features noticed in Nolamba sculptures call for a careful comparative study of features in late Pallava, early Chola and Rashtrakuta carvings."'5 With that objective in mind, Sivaramamurti seeks origins in Ca-lukya, Rastrak-ta, Pallava and C6la elements to explain features seen in Hemavati (Madras Museum) sculptures. A hairstyle might be Pallava or CO!a, and a necklace Ca!ukya. For example, Sivaramamurti compares a Hemavati Daksinamurti to figures from Kaveripakkam, a site which he calls "...late Pallava influenced to a great extent by Chalukya Rashtrak-ta traditions." He sees the jatds of the hair as "Pallava and Chola type," and the yaj#opavita (sacred thread) is worn in a manner that "is at once suggestive of the Pallava tradition both from the Pallava and Chalukya territory [sic]."7 One is bewildered by these ambiguous attributions: The hair is like the Pallava and Col6a type, but the Pallava image from Kaveripakkam is "influenced" by Ca-!ukyas and Rastrak-tas. Is the hair then a Pallava-Cola-Calukya-RastrakFta type? The yajfopavita is from the Pallava tradition A condensed version of this paper was presented to the American Committee for South Asian Art Symposium, Brooklyn Museum, I994. My book, Temple Architecture and Sculpture of the Nolambas (pth-loth Centuries) (New Delhi: Manohar Publishers, forth- coming), offers a more comprehensive discussion of this subject. For their many critical comments, I am indebted to Richard Davis, Gary Tartakov, Cathy Asher, Susan Huntington, Carol Bolon, Stanley Murashige, and Mark DeLancey. 2 For convenience I retain dynastic names for periods and, although I discuss the modes of artistic representations regionally, I believe dynastic polity contributes to artistic formations. 3 C.

Sivaramamurti uses dynastic appellations to explain styles to the point of meaninglessness. The propensity for seeking origins - as if finding the source of an element then explains the new context - or attempting to explain elements as analogous to other similar-appearing elements in order to explicate form is a tendency in some scholarship. I, too, during much of my fieldwork ex- pected the time-honored method of seeking artistic origins and influences from territories controlled by large dynasties outside of No!ambavadi would somehow explain the appearance or "style" of No- !amba period monuments. However, after completely surveying the Nolambavadi region I realized that I needed not only primary documentation, but also a better way to talk about the formation of art in areas controlled by minor - that is less studied - dynasties. I suggest historians of Indian art need to question the 'essentialism' in dynastic and regional studies that assumes there exists some 'spirit' or 'nature' of a dynasty - either an artistic spirit, or a nature of each dynasty expressing itself in certain shapes, images and motifs identifiable with (and the property of) that dynasty. This essentialism allows one to arbitrarily define an artistic spirit and then assume this spirit spreads outwards, transcending all other criteria. The problem with this sort of thinking is that it allows generalizations of the characteristics of a Cola temple, for instance, to truly define 'Co!a,' so that when the same (more likely, similar) characteristics are seen elsewhere, it is assumed that we are still witnessing 'Cola' (or, at least, Cola-influenced art). The stronger the spirit (i.e., larger dynasties have more powerful artistic essences) the more "influence" it has over others. It is as if there were only room for major dynastic personalities or major styles and all others had to be seen as dependent styles. Art then is recreated in scholarship to reflect a modern aesthetic recapitula- tion of the supposed regional political hierarchy under consideration. This approach disregards the diverse and complex factors that contribute to why a temple looks the way it does. How should we address art developed in the peripheral regions of India's great dynastic capitals? Must the stylistic character of every local art be attributed to the "essential character" of neighboring macro-centers, or can we understand the art better as locally-based and relatively autonomous? Are Nolamba monuments only the provincial (hence, inferior) imitations of their more powerful military and political neighbors, or are they somehow appropriate expressions of their own local circum- stances? I suggest that monuments in smaller - less studied - regions need to be recognized not as the commingling of "influences" from the larger and more familiar dynasties, but, rather as autonom- ous local expressions revealing a dialectical response to neighboring monuments and not a simple subordination to them. Or, to be more precise, it is not the monuments that are responding to others, but the human agencies responsible for the monuments. To understand temple art it must be seen as the product of human agents, expressing the interests of those agents, not as concealed essences. Local, "minor," polities have autonomous wills and interests quite distinct from their larger more powerful neighbors and so their expressions, whether political or aesthetic, will be their own and not merely miniature reproductions of the interests or wills of their nearby powerful neighbors. Even if we cannot identify all the agencies involved and their motivations for involvement we might benefit from remembering that the temple is a complex monument, both in its form and in its purpose. 18</page><page sequence="3">Centrality and periphery here are defined as a fluctuating opposition rather than, as has more com- monly been the practice, as a continuum or a diminishing extension.8 Political and artistic centers do not always coincide, but I am arguing that issues of polity and centrality need to be included in the discourse. Of course an obvious point, but one that I think should not be dismissed as trite, is that what is considered peripheral relative to a 'major' center, becomes central within another context. Within No!ambavadi (considered peripheral by [art] historians) I call the Nolamba capital, Hema- vati, central. Art from Hemavati and the rest of No!ambavadi should not be considered inferior, or unoriginal. Even if monuments are based on models from other localities (or 'influenced'9 as that word is often used), the resulting product, due to training of artisans, available materials, patron demands and other requirements, is reshaped according to immediate needs. After studying artistic developments in peripheral regions of a cultural context other than India, that of medieval and Renaissance eastern Europe, Jan Bialostocki observes: Periphery is an area situated far away from the powerful center and not dependent on the influences coming from one place, but which receives inspirations from many regions and centers. Periphery is an area where various influences mix and merge and where no one of them obtains decisive superiority; that allows the artist of the peripheral regions to make the choice to develop the independently chosen elements and to create out of various influences an art autonomous and original.Io Although I found Bialostocki's observations helpful, he essentializes central and periphery as fixed places. Another approach to the same situation, at least as I see it for medieval south India, would be to recognize the great centers as autonomous yet connected and in a world of slow, limited commu- nication - contrasted to today's immediate maximum communication - all centers, major and minor, are peripheral to each other: responding to one and another if or when found to be required or help- ful. Artists distant from major dynastic centers are aware of divergent forms that might come from any number of localities. They reshape designs, within the limitations of their training and skill, to satisfy the specific needs and demands of any given situation unbeholden to any particular tradition but susceptible to all those nearby. When building a temple there are many complex agents involved in varying stages of the construction contributing to the final appearance. Local tradition and auton- omy predominate, but do not block other elements from potential use. There is a teleological formalism predominating in most art historical accounts that explains artists, works or periods influencing subsequent artists, works and periods as if some style or period essence proceeds uninterrupted. Art historians' search for origins and evolutions might at times misrepresent the art and ideas rather than explain them." Although some art historians feel uneasy with the evolu- tionist approach, many implicit assumptions concerning essences in Indian art historical scholarship remain intact. Although my discussion focuses specifically on the question of centrality and periphery in medieval south Indian polity, I am also questioning the way conventional art histories have assigned certain art or the field of study of certain arts to the (hopefully silent) periphery of art history. 9 For one of the few articles to consider critically the notion of 'influence' as it is used in Indian art history, see: Gary Tartakov and Vidya Dehejia, "Sharing, Intrusion, and Influence: The Mahisasuramardini Imagery of the Calukyas and the Pallavas," Artibus Asiae 45, no. 4 (1984), 287-345. 1o Jan Bialostocki, "Some Values of Artistic Periphery."

" This problem, especially regarding the history of ideas, is explained by Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge (New York: Pantheon books, 1972). 19</page><page sequence="4">One problem (as many art historians today acknowledge) is that the conventional models for non- western studies are based on Eurocentric paradigms, and, specifically in art history, the predominant normative model for (world) art history has been based on assumptions regarding the Italian Re- naissance. As Svetlana Alpers shows, even areas of western art have been significantly distorted by scholars operating on the assumption that the mode of making art during the Italian Renaissance is correct for other (pre-modern) cultures.' On the western standard India, of course, did not "correctly" evolve artistically (or in any manner, according to some). As was the case in the Renais- sance, proper art should be rational, scientific, proportional, balanced: it is based on the human fig- ure, which, of course, means man. Unbalanced, or irrational, art is hence feminine" - which, as it is used, becomes a derogatory term. In orientalist scholarship the term 'feminine' has also been used in describing the essence of the mind of India.'4 The subtle survival of the western evolutionist, Renais- sance model implicit in most Indian art historical scholarship is a serious problem that we have only begun to debate. The intellectual manipulations which try to reconstitute knowledge of other peoples (i.e., orientalism) is not a new topic.15 In Imagining India, Ronald Inden thoroughly critiques Indological discourse as it has constructed India. I have little to add other than to point out that historiography engenders modes of discourse: revisions to commonly accepted models of south Indian polity could help in developing new approaches to dynastic or regional art studies. The available histories of medieval south India are presented as hegemonic texts in both form and content. The authors' intentions are to present studies that are empirically comprehensive and au- thoritative; their primary concern is for the dynastic histories of major kings, their political networks, and the competition among dynastic powers. Often these studies have an inherently biased political agenda. The British presented countless studies which subtly justified their historic role in India. And following their lead many English-educated (directly or indirectly) Indian scholars carried on in this vein though with different objectives.16 Using European empiricism to demon- strate historical parallels between Indian and European political institutions, many historians wanted to present medieval Indian government more like that of constitutional monarchs than as oriental despots.7 Most notable for contributions to south Indian and Deccan history are K.A. Nilakanta Sastri and A.S. Altekar.18 Although there is much to be admired in these studies, their adoption of European models has given an unwarranted emphasis on efficient, centralized dynastic power. According to Nilakanta Sastri and Altekar, lesser dynasties remain subjugated powers, inconsequen- tial except according to the situation as allies or foes of the dominating dynasties. Scholars following the conventional history see the centralized large dynasty (in the case of my study, that would be the :z Svetlana Alpers, "Style Is What You Make It," in The Concept of Style, ed.

Obviously what follows is that smaller peripheral dynasties, and art from those areas, are depicted as unimaginative, derivative, inferior. This historical model, even when written by "nationalist historians," is an extrusion of discourse that originates in orientalist thinking. Many Indian scholars trying to regain a sense of agentic past, denied by earlier British historians, have adopted methods embedded in European political thought that unwittingly perpetuate models that emphasize centralized political domination. Most historians of Indian art have accepted this conventional thinking as accurate. I believe this is why many temples have been labelled 'C6!a' (or 'Ra-strakuta,' etc.) when the validity of such attributions is questionable. My earlier point regarding the Italian Renaissance as the normative model for art studies is relevant here. Much art is judged by a Western and especially a Renaissance ideal. This way of looking at art, through a lens that defines normalcy, was extended to India. Art associated with dynasties that in conventional historical models were predominant (e.g., C6las, R-astrakfitas) also became the standard upon which to judge other modes of artistic work. The validity of the large centralized, bureaucratic dynastic model is challenged by the work of some recent scholars. Burton Stein shows how decentralized the actual political authority was within the Cola realm and presents the king's overlordship as mostly symbolic.19 Ronald Inden sees the Rdstrakuta king's authority intact but explains the "imperial formation" as dialectically and eristi- cally constituted, with the emphasis on complex, shifting human agencies which compose the forma- tion.z" Nicholas Dirks discusses "little kingdoms," those of the periphery, in relation to large king- doms. " In contrast to Nilakanta Sastri's view that the Cola realm was controlled by Cala kings, who organized an efficient, centralized, bureaucratized administrative structure, Stein concludes that the Cola realm was a 'segmentary state' of locally controlled nadus ("self-sufficient ethno-agrarian micro regions"), and that their leaders' relation with the Cola kings was ritualistic." A complex balance existed between local groups including the dominant agriculturalists, local chieftains, Brahmins, and merchants, in order to perpetuate relatively autonomous nadus. Here authority was decentralized. There was no powerful central bureaucracy overseeing everything, including temple construction. As our understanding of the Cola polity becomes clearer, perhaps the more problematic study of local artistic forms will reveal that the convenient attribution of "C6la" (or Cola-influenced) to temples, especially those at the perimeter of Co!amandalam, needs rethinking. Inden presents a much different model of polity. He argues that an essentialism - which he explains as inherent in academic discourse on Indian state, religion, caste, etc., - should be replaced by a theory of human agency. Agents are complex and shifting, they reconstitute one another through a dialectical and eristical process in changing and overlapping situations. At length, Inden's critique of Indological discourse exposes major assumptions and, in his opinion, fallacies intrinsic in most of these works, including his own earlier work on caste. 19 Burton Stein, Peasant State and Society in Medieval South India (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980). 20zo Inden, Imagining India. zI Nicholas Dirks, The Hollow Crown (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). 22zz Stein's 'segmentary state' theory is partially challenged by Noboru Karashima, South Indian History and Society (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984).

For comments by Inden, Imagining, 2o6-II. 21</page><page sequence="6">Using the same historical sources such as epigraphs and other available materials that historians employ, Inden demonstrates how one period of medieval history, that of the Rastrakutas, can be presented. He discusses how the king, councils, assemblies and other complex agencies dialectically and eristically composed the Rastrakuta formation, which was continually being completed, con- tested and remade during specific cyclic processions. The same process and similar agencies that constituted the Rastrakuta imperial formation also composed smaller kingdoms like the No!ambas, but on a lesser scale. To a greater or lesser degree, depending on the strength of the involved agents, simple kingdoms functioned within the dialectics of the imperial formation. Inden discusses temple building as a political as well as religious act, and shows how certain temples are integral to rituals which constitute the imperial formation. For example, he argues that Kaila-sana-tha at Ellora was the finale of Rastraku-ta King Krsna I's conquests, and the enshrined deity was intended as the imperial overlord. His discussion helps put the monument in historical context, possibly in a clearer manner than most. Still, his concern with only imperial temples raises a plethora of unanswered questions (which were not of his concern) regarding temples without known imperial affliation. For instance, who built temples within the Rastrakuta realm such as the Jaina temples at Hallur and Pattadakal, or the other temples in Karnataka usually labelled 'Rastrakuta' at Kukkanur, Sirval, Aihole? And, a question of peculiar interest for art historians: how should we discuss the mo- dal diversity of forms encountered in this imperial formation which expands over areas controlled by simple kingdoms? Inden's discussion seems to reintroduce the imperial king as the arbiter of temple shape. Nonetheless, his provocative model offers a way for art historians to re-evaluate their assump- tions regarding polity, dynasties, and how we discuss monuments. Dirks' study explains the interdependency of "little kingdoms" and "large kingdoms" and dis- cusses how "symbolic" acts (ritual gifts) are the substance which binds the two. Although Dirks' main focus is on the Pudukkottai state during the British Raj, his discussion explains kingship in south India from the Pallavas onwards. His study demonstrates how authority fluctuates and how little kings became large, contradicting centralized dynastic models. The sovereignty of a subordinate lord, thus, is always dependent on, indeed part of, the sovereignty of the greater lord. However, the king's gift is at once binding and potentially divisive. The more gifts of honors and right the overlord makes to his subordinate, and - in what is a logical and political consequence of this - the more the subordinate participates in the sovereignty of his overlord, the more the subordinate is represented as sovereign in his own right. While gift giving articulates relations both of solidarity and hierarchy, simultaneously creating by its own internal dynamic the transactional poles of center and periphery, the possibility implicit in every gift is the cessation of the gift relationship. This possibility is made real by the very substance of the gift: authorrity itself.23 Once a subordinate, now a sovereign, the shift of authority is relative to context. The No!amba king of my study was sovereign within his realm and made gifts to subordinates and temples and, I argue, his relation to an overlord was only as binding as required during specific situations. Indian cosmology and polity was much more fluid than the western "medieval" construct yet there is a tendency to apply the same rigid hierarchic model to both. Dirks, like Stein and Inden, discusses the integral role of temple to kingship and Indian society. 23 Dirks, Hollow Crown, 47-48. 22</page><page sequence="7">Conventional dynastic art studies, I believe, unjustifiably assume that the art affiliated with smaller dynasties is derivative of the regionally dominating centralized dynasties. This approach in- correctly assumes that an artistic essence can be attributed to dynasties, just as it assumes that an un- changing centralized bureaucracy controls regional polity. The common understanding of Nolam- bavadi is restricted by conventional studies that do not question south Indian polity and art; hence this epistemological closure has perpetuated a reductionist history that misrepresents the regional complexities and often ignores the human agencies responsible for temples. I suggest that within a given region, including a peripheral region such as Nolambavadi, defined by socio-political circumstances extended over a related period, a relatively autonomous art could be perpetuated while still sharing artistic elements from neighboring regions. Sharing implies that a vast body of knowledge, in this case modes of artistic representation and of iconography, was known among artisans and that this knowledge was not restricted by political borders. Shared or new artistic forms and ideas from all directions could interact with concerned complex agents - be they the king as patron or other types of patronage, temple officials and priests, possibly merchants or other sup- pliers of materials, and, especially, the artisans and their own interaction among themselves and with other artisan families. Together, in accordance with the demands and conditions within a given time and location, the art was formed and reconstituted. Sometimes, however, even though images were known, because they were signs of political power, they were contested rather than shared. Artisans, and other concerned agencies, chose which artistic elements were required according to the needs and demands of a particular monument. Similarities in temple forms (i.e., sharing) then were not the re- sult of divergent influences. Dissimilarities in temple forms, I suggest, are the result of agents deciding which elements to utilize or to omit, and which elements to recompose in response to other monuments - hence, we might say, temples are dialectically constituted. Instead of seeing how one temple "influenced" another temple (can a temple influence?), we might ask why one temple is built in a manner that purposely restructures elements seen at another temple while still maintaining the same basic temple form. For instance, instead of the evolutionist approach which says that the (Pallava) Kailasanatha at Kafici influenced the (Ca-!ukya) Virupaksa temple at Pattadakal, which influenced the (Rastrakuta) Kaila-sa temple at Ellora, we could discuss reasons why the creators of one temple, in response to another temple, chose to reject some attributes, reshape other attributes, while retaining the basic form. Continuity and change need not be explained as essences, but rather in accordance with the circumstances and agencies that compose monuments. Other dissimilarities in surface appearance, and probably the major contributor to diversity, can be attributable to the collective training and the working method of locally based artisan workshops. Modes of artistic representation are determined by contributing artisans within a given locality. Hence I agree with those who advocate the study of style or idiom regionally,24 but I do not believe that a regional artistic essence exists which can be explained separately from the complex agencies which dialectically compose regional polity. When discussing "idiom" all the contributing external factors probably are not identifiable; yet, this does not excuse us from at least remembering that temples are more than artistic essences. 14 For some of the issues and an advocacy for regional (opposed to dynastic) labels see: Pramod Chandra, On the Study of Indian Art (Cambridge: Harvard University, I983), 70-72- 23</page><page sequence="8">More documentation of local traditions in south India and Deccan is required to discuss clearly regional diversity and modal interchange. Temples in south Karnataka, northwest Tamilnadu, southwest Andhra Pradesh (i.e., Gafngava-di, Kofngu, Re-nandu, etc.) which often are labelled "Cola," and temples in Karnataka labelled "Rastrakuta" especially need study. Hopefully monuments from Nolambavadi and other lesser known monuments will be included within the art historical discourse and we will begin to have a clearer understanding of how monuments are shaped, and why. THE NOLAMBA BHAIRAVA (HENJERAPPA) IMAGE AT HEMAVATI How then, once accepting that monuments are dialectically composed by complex agents within complicated, fluctuating situations, does one discuss temple "art"? One manner of inquiry that might prove productive is a "functionalist" approach which attempts to explain how and why a monument appears as it does without focusing on essences, origins and influences. According to David Summers, A functionalist history of art is not a history of how art has changed, or even in a simple sense of what art "means." It is rather a history of what art has done, or to put two goals together, it is a history that explains why works of art look the way they look in terms of what art has been meant to do.25 The skeptical reader might object: how accurately can the art historian reinvent historical function and context? I suggest, however, that the perverse and problematic method of functionalism enlivens "art." I will now discuss a particular sculpture, "Hefijerappa," as it might have functioned within the No!amba dynastic realm. Although I do not conclude a definite singular function for this image, my discussion does present the likely contributing factors which make the image what it is. My main goal is to explain No!amba monuments within their own environment rather than as simple ex- tensions of other dominating regional dynasties. In the Siddesvara temple at Hemavati, once the Nolamba capital, there is an imposing Bhairava image (fig. I), locally known as "Hefijerappa," which has been in perpetual, or intermittent, worship for over a millennium. Enshrined within the Siddesvara garbhagrha (inner sanctum), Hefijerappa is the central and only temple icon. In this geographic region, it is rare to find an anthropomorphic form of Siva in a garbhagrha. During the Virasaiva movement of the twelfth century onwards almost all enshrined Siva images (mzurti) were replaced by ligas. However, Virafaivas (Lifigayats) - people who wear a small liga around their neck and consider the linga as the proper form of Siva to worship - currently control this temple and, evidently, a traditional respect towards Hefijerappa has kept the sculpture from being removed. This image, to me, then presents a problem of function, not "style." The "style" is "No!amba": locally produced for a given situation. As argued above, to describe the image negatively, as product of divergent stylistic influences, distorts the sculpture and in no way explains its appearance. Bhai- rava displays stylistic idiosyncracies seen in other late ninth-early tenth centuries sculptures from Hemavati - see for instance the "Kali" (fig. 2) now at the Madras Government Museum which Sivaramamurti describes in terms of motifs derived from Calukya and Cola sculptures.26 25 David Summers, "'Form,' Nineteenth-Century Metaphysics, and the Problem of Art Historical Description," Critical Inquiry 5 (1989), 393. 6Sivaramamurti, Nolamba, 17-18. 24</page><page sequence="9">I? . .

In three of his hands he holds a trisiula (trident, upper right), damaru (drum, upper left) and kapala (skull cup); the lower left hand forms abhaya-mudrd ("fear-not"). The attributes are held in a naturalistic manner: the fingers around the trisula are relaxed, the damaru rests in the palm and fingers of the hand, not held by two fingers which often is the manner of placement. Stylized hair ringlets encircle the head in two rows, appearing like a halo. The apex of the head is adorned with a munda (skull), a ndga (snake) en- twines the forehead. Nagas also form the keyura (upper armlets). He wears a munda-yajgopavita (sacred-thread composed of skulls). Other ornaments include a sirnhamukha mekhala (lion-headed belt) with jewels, a ratnaddma (jeweled necklace), a katibandha (waist band), kundalas (earrings), and circular bracelets and anklets. The youthful, round, fleshy face has two small fangs protruding from the mouth. This is not a Bhairava emphasizing his ugra (ferocious) nature; rather it is a welcoming figure. However, at I12 centimeters high and measuring 92 centimeters at the widest point, this large, black schist figure has a dominating presence. No surviving information (i.e., epigraphs) states the image's origins and purpose, nor is there any information regarding the complex agents' intentions when they had this image composed. The function of an image varies over time as people reinterpret the image and their own needs, but, even today, the high regard local people show towards Hefijerappa supports my suspicion that he had special status from inception. Present day Hemavati is called Henijeru in No!amba epigraphs. Appa, in Kannada, means father (also it is a respectful suffix): Hefijerappa is the father, or protector, of Henijeru. People regularly seek Henijerappa's blessing and in times of trouble petition him for resolution. As mentioned, Vira'aivas ritually maintain Hefijerappa. Although Virasaivas are strict vegetarians, on special occasions the priests to Hefijerappa allow goat sacrifice (Bhairava is, after all, a wrathful deity) and the meat is cooked and eaten within the Sidde-vara compound.17 It appears that their own Virasaiva teachings are subordinate to Hefijerappa's traditional needs. It is known that No!amba kings patronized the PaSupata Saivas in Hemavati and there is good reason to believe the more enigmatic Kalamukhas also were present. According to a Nolamba inscription LakullSa, the premier teacher of the Pa-upatas, was himself incarnated and lived in Hemavati as Cilluka-bhatara: "Lakulisa, fearing that his own name and works of dharmma would be forgotten, became incarnate and was born again on the earth as the muninatha Chilluka."28 The No!amba King Iriva entrusted to Cilluka-bhatara a land grant in order to maintain the god Nanin- nesvara. Iriva's father, Ayyapa, had the biruda (title) Nanni, "the asylum of truth," and Naninne-vara probably was the royal deity (and protector) of Ayyapa. As religious agencies within Nolamba polity, priests are charged with ritual maintenance of royal monuments. Rituals are serious actions which, if not performed properly, can have serious conse- quences for the doer, the king, the realm.z9 At the royal temple at Baraguru, built by No!amba King Mahendra (in Saka 800= 878 A.D.), is inscribed the warning against ritual transgression by the priest 17 During one of my stays in Hemavati, an extended family from Bangalore, about 140 kilometers away, came for their annual worship to Hefijerappa - their ancestoral deity, as they told me - at which time they performed a goat sacrifice. 8Epigraphica Carnatica (hereafter cited as EC), 1z: Si 28.

"A ma.thapati who is not a Brahmachari, has ruined the king who rules him, the ndd, and the assembly of the village, and is guilty of the five great sins."30 A supreme deity - a divine overlord - whose grace and sustenance legitimized a king and his realm was a critical aspect of regional polity.3' A ferocious form of Siva, feared even by time himself (Kala),32 Bhairava is an able protector and overlord for a king seeking to consolidate his realm (as is Virabhadra, see below). Hefijerappa, I suspect, was chosen by one or more of the Nolamba kings as their paramount deity. Responsibility for proper ritualistic maintenance to the deity, which is ex- tended to the king and his realm, was charged to the Pa-upatas and/or Ka-lamukhas. In reference to Karnataka, the Pa-upatas and Kalamukhas are considered synonymous by some scholars. In Ka-lamukha epigraphs they sometimes refer to themselves as adherents to the Lakulaga- mas,33 and Handiqui concludes: "The Lakula or Pa-upata system is generally mentioned in the Mysore inscriptions in connection with the Ka-lamukha sect; and there is no doubt that the PaSupatas were known as Ka-lamukhas in the Kannada country."34 Another scholar suggests that Cilluka, the incarnation of Lakulisa was, indeed, a Kalamukha preceptor.35 The earliest Kalamukha inscriptions in Karna-taka (806 and 81o A.D.) are from Nandi, a No!amba center; however, besides the Tandikonda grant of ca. 958, few epigraphs specify Ka-lamukha affiliation again until the eleventh century, at which time some Nolamba grants do specify K-lamukhas.36 There remains much confusion regarding the K-lamukhas, little is known about their practices and no surviving texts have rectified this problem.37 The ugra forms of Siva were definitely important to the Kapalikas, another Saiva sect coeval with the Kalamukhas, and sometimes the two are confused. Bhairava is the paramount deity to the Ka-palikas; it remains uncertain if Bhairava occupied a similar position in Kalamukha doc- trines.38 At Mulgund (Dharwad district), a site alleged to have been a Ka-lamukha center in the mid-tenth century and later, there is a Kalabhairava temple. An enormous (3.50 meters high) standing six- armed Bhairava, flanked by two four-armed female attendants, is enshrined in the temple. Sundara has identified this image as Virabhadra because a small goat-headed figure projects from the base in between the Bhairava's feet.39 Sundara states that Virabhadra, in the form of Bhairava, was wor- 30 EC, 12: Si 38. 31 Inden, Imagining, 253-56. 3 iva Purdna 3.8.47 (Siva said:) "You are called Bhairava because you are of terrifying features and you are capable of supporting the universe.

No Kalamukha affiliated text survives; limited information regarding Kaldmukha rituals can be obtained by reading inscriptions. Lorenzen concentrates on inscriptions during the eleventh-twelfth centuries, which state definite Kalamukha affiliation. I have read the same epigraphs, and ones dating earlier. He concludes, and I concur, that the Kalamukha and PaSupata rituals were closely related. Also see Handiqui, Ya.astilaka regarding the Pa~upatas, the Kalamukhas and other religious (and socio-political) conditions of tenth-century Karnataka. 38 Lorenzen, The Kpdlikas and Kldmukhas, 4, 83-84. 39 A.

Virabhadra, the destroyer of Daksa's sacrifice, also was important to the Pa-upatas4I and in pur-nic texts sometimes Virabhadra and Bhairava are interchangeable or analogous.41 It has been suggested that Hefijerappa is Yajfiarisvara, that is, Virabhadra.43 Possibly due to Kalamukha ritual needs, many Bhairava images survive from the Nolamba period, although none as imposing as Hefijerappa. Per- haps Ka-lamukha rites at Hemavati required pujda to Bhairava, hence his presence in the garbhagrha of the Siddesvara temple; or, Pa-upata rites required pujd to Virabhadra. Images in Indian art inten- tionally can have multiple readings. Maybe Hefijerappa is both Virabhadra and Bhairava and wor- shipped by the Kalamukhas and/or the Pa-upatas. However, without definite information regarding Kalamukha rituals - or, proof that it was indeed the Kalamukhas, in addition to the related Pa-u- patas at Hemavati - this question remains open. The protective and potentially destructive aspect of Hefijerappa, as recognized today, might help support my suggestion that Hefijerappa's original function was as overlord to Hefijeru in No!amba times. Probably a royal deity to one or more Nolamba kings and made in conformity with Pa-u- pata/Ka-lamukha rites, Hefijerappa is an example of an image formulated and his appearance com- posed in response to the needs and demands of the complex agencies within the dialectics of Nolamba polity. Additionally, he should now be recognized as a product of local artisans, working during the Nolamba period, who shaped the image according to their own skills and knowledge. There is nothing about the image's surface design, or the various parts and motifs which together formulate the image, that suggests a copying or reliance on models from 'major' dynastic centers. Hence, this Bhairava image is but one reason for a history of Nolamba monuments. 40 Ibid., 153-54. 4I Stella Kramrisch, The Presence of iva (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981), 332: "Although the Pa upata doctrine may appear to be grafted onto the myth of Daksa's sacrifice, the two are intrinsically connected. They stem from the primordial scene and preserve its metaphysical ontology in terms of myth and religion. At the time of the Puranas, the Pa-upata doctrine had long been established." 42 For example, "Lord [Vira]Bhadra surrounded by the Bhadras shone like Kalabhairava surrounded by hundreds of deadly fires at the time of dissolution." iva Purdna 7.I19-56; or, "(V-Irabhadra said) ...I have assumed the form of Bhairava." Linga Purdna 1.96.42. Usually Virabhadra is considered to be an emanation from Siva's hair. 43 Paramalivayya, "Nolambara Herimjeru Mahaphatiksth-ana" In Nolamba Itihadsa Darshana, 68. (in Kannada).
