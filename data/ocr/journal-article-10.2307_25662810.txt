Called and Matthew Miller^ Background: Body mass index (BMI) has been linked with both increased and decreased risk of suicide attempts and deaths. Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 1.1 million adults, participants reported their anthropometric and other characteristics in 1982. Participants were followed for cause-specific mortality through 2004. Results: A total of 2231 participants died of suicide during 21.6 million person-years of follow-up. Compared with a BMI of 18.5? 22.9 kg/m2, adjusted hazard ratios for completed suicide were 0.99 (95% confidence interval = 0.72-1.37), 0.78 (0.69-0.88), 0.73 (0.65-0.82), 0.72 (0.62-0.83), 0.77 (0.65-0.92), and 0.55 (0.36 0.83) for BMI values &lt;18.5, 23.0-24.9, 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and &gt;35.0 kg/m2, respectively. The relationship was consistent among men and women and across geographic regions, but was limited to married individuals (test for interaction, P = 0.009). Conclusions: The risk of death from suicide is inversely related to BMI in middle-aged and older adults. Obesity and depression have a complex relationship. Given the social stigma associated with obesity, it is not surprising that obesity has been associated with depressive symptoms in several studies.1-3 Other studies have the found the opposite,4-6 supporting the "jolly fat" hypothesis. If obesity is positively associated with depression and anxiety symptoms, it might be hypothesized that overweight and obese individuals would have a higher risk of suicide. A series of studies (with generally few cases of suicide) have suggested exactly the opposite,7-10 particularly among men,11-13 Submitted 30 January 2009; accepted 7 May 2009; posted 10 November 2009.

To determine the association of body mass index (BMI) with risk of suicide, we studied over 1 million participants of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II, who have been followed for mortality for over 20 years. METHODS Cancer Prevention Study II is a prospective study of mortality among 1,184,657 men and women that was begun by the American Cancer Society in 1982.16 Participants were identified and enrolled by over 77,000 volunteers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Those enrolled were usually friends, neighbors, or relatives of the volunteers. Families were enrolled if at least one household member was 45 years of age or older, and all enrolled members were at least 30 years of age. In 1982, 1,184,507 participants completed a confidential questionnaire that was mailed to them; the questionnaire is available online.17 Par ticipants provided information on demographic characteris tics, personal and family history of diseases, various aspects of behavior, environmental and occupational exposures, and diet. We excluded 26,818 participants missing information on height or weight, 2200 with BMI values beyond the extreme 0.1 or 99.9 percentiles, and 526 missing information on medical history, leaving 1,154,963 participants for analysis. Analyses of deidentified data were approved for exemption from continuing review by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Committee on Clinical Investigation. Anthropomorphic Measures On the questionnaire, participants reported their current weight, their weight 1 year previously, and their height (without shoes). We categorized BMI (the weight in kilo grams divided by the square of the height in meters) as underweight (&lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5-22.9 and 23.0 24.9), grade 1 overweight (25.0-29.9), grade 2 overweight (30.0-39.9), and grade 3 overweight (40.0 or higher); the category of 18.5-22.9 was set as the referent. We defined stable weight as individuals with a weight change (gain or loss) of 5 pounds or less in the preceding year. 82 | vwvw.epidem.com Epidemiology Volume 21, Number 1, January 2010</page><page sequence="2">Epidemiology Volume 21, Number 1, January 2010_BMI and Suicide Assessment of Suicide Death Deaths that occurred between enrollment and Decem ber 2004 were ascertained through detailed individual inquir ies by American Cancer Study volunteers in September 1984, September 1986, and September 1988 and then through linkage with the National Death Index beginning in 1989. Death certificates or codes for cause of death were requested for all identified deceased participants and were obtained for 99% of all deaths.18 For deaths occurring from 1989 through 2004, we defined suicide as International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes E950-E959 and ICD-10 codes X60-X84 and Y87.0. Prior to 1989, a single code was used for all suicides. Statistical Analysis We calculated person-years for each participant from the date of return of the 1982 questionnaire to the date of death, or 31 December 2004. In Cox proportional hazards analyses, we controlled for age (linear and centered quadratic terms), race, smoking, comorbidity (each of 6 prevalent conditions), geographical region, physical activity, marital status, religion, educational attainment, alcohol consumption, psychoactive medication use (each of 3 classes), and presence of a recent stressful life event; men and women had indepen dent baseline hazard functions. We evaluated the proportional hazards assumption with visual inspection of plots of scaled Schoenfeld residuals and -log(-log(survival probability)) with time. We created indicator variables for individuals with missing information for covariates, but exclusion of such individuals had no qualitative effect on our findings. For tests of trend, we included BMI as a continuous variable. RESULTS Selected characteristics of the cohort according to BMI are shown in Table 1. BMI tended to be positively associated with diabetes and inversely associated with current smoking, white race, and previous cancer. A total of 2231 participants died of suicide during 21,632,509 years of follow-up, a rate of 10.3/100,000 person years. The median age at death from suicide was 69 years. Table 2 shows incidence rates and hazard ratios for suicide according to BMI. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, there was generally lower suicide mortality with increasing BMI. Additional adjustment for a number of sociodemographic and clinical factors modestly attenuated the results but a nearly 2-fold gradient in risk remained across the spectrum of BMI. Stratified analyses are shown in Table 3. Exclusion of those with extreme BMI did not influence the linear associ ation of BMI with risk. BMI appeared to be inversely asso ciated with risk only among married adults, although the unmarried subgroup represented less than 20% of the cohort. Among unmarried participants, the hazard ratios for suicide mortality per 5 kg/m2 increment in BMI were all close to the null for single, divorced, and widowed participants.

DISCUSSION An emerging body of literature supports an inverse relationship of BMI with risk of suicide death,7"13,19 although suicide attempts (rather than completed suicides) have been positively associated with BMI in several samples world wide.20"22 In Norway, BMI was found to be inversely asso ciated with risk of suicide despite a generally positive asso ciation with depression.9 The seemingly contradictory inverse association of BMI with risk of completed suicide but positive association with depression or suicide attempts sug gest that depression and suicide attempts have distinct risk factor precursors from completed suicide. Our findings differed little between men and women. This contrasts with the particularly adverse relationship of heavier BMI with mental health in women. For example, in the 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Sur vey, heavier BMI was associated with increased odds of suicide attempts among women, but decreased odds among men.23 However, in the HUNT Study,9 heavier measured BMI was associated with lower risk of completed suicide in both sexes, as we observed. The apparent multiplicative interaction of BMI with marital status has not been observed previously.13 In unmar 84 | vvww.epidem.com ? 2009 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins</page><page sequence="4">Epidemiology Volume 21, Number 1, January 2010_BMI and Suicide ried persons, the postulated beneficial effects of higher BMI may be counterbalanced by the well-known stigma associated with overweight and obesity.24 This stigma may be attenuated in the setting of marriage, where spouses are commonly BMI-concordant.25 Studies of BMI and health outcomes are prone to several problems.26 These include confounding by disorders and behaviors (such as smoking27) that themselves lead to weight loss but also increase risk of suicide. To evaluate this possibility, we excluded participants who died in the first 2 years of follow-up (when increased risk due to pre-existing conditions tends to be strongest26), and those who reported recent weight change, major chronic diseases, current or former smoking, or use of sedatives. We also used a referent category of normal-weight individuals (although under weight was not associated with higher risk). The consis tency of our results in these analyses tends to support our findings, as do studies from cohorts with repeated mea sures of weight13 or teenage populations (where the like lihood of chronic disease is low).712 Neither hypnotics/benzodiazepine use nor social sup port appeared to confound the association of BMI with risk of suicide death to any substantial degree, although both were themselves associated with risk. However, we did not have systematic information on depression or antidepressants. We also did not have information on use of substances other than alcohol and tobacco, although this has been associated both positively and inversely with obesity in population sur veys.3'28 Future studies ideally need to incorporate repeated measures of depression and measured BMI, in samples with large numbers of outcomes, to evaluate whether depression acts as a mediator or a confounder of the relationship between BMI and completed suicide.29 The Cancer Prevention Study II is subject to other limitations. Participants were a convenience sample of ac quaintances of American Cancer Society volunteers and were predominately white, although the sample is geographically diverse and more representative than populations defined by region or occupation. Nonetheless, studies of BMI and sui cide among minority populations, in which the epidemic of obesity is particularly profound, are still needed. We relied on self-reported measures of height and weight, although all assessments were made prospectively. Self-reports of height and weight tend to provide valid rank ordering of individuals,30 albeit with underreporting of weight that increases at greater levels of BMI.31 Furthermore, we observed the expected associations of BMI with other outcomes.32 In conclusion, higher BMI was strongly associated with a lower risk of suicide mortality among US adults. Given this relationship, research to identify its mechanisms could lead to important insights into prevention of this important cause of death. REFERENCES 1. Scott KM, Bruffaerts R, Simon GE, et al.
