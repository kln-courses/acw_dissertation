Pp. xi + 228. L 24.500. Although this is a translation of Interpretación literaria de textos bíblicos (Ma- drid: Cristiandad, 1987), and the second volume in a series entitled Hermenéutica de la Palabra , it actually contains, for the first time in English, the substance of the author's doctoral thesis, published under the title Estudios de poetica hebrea (Bar- celona: Juan Flors, 1963). But unlike the 1971 German translation, this new manual totally discards the genre of doctoral dissertation and aims to be a "manual for human hands to handle and touch . . . not a source of information ... or a reference book but rather a book of initiation into the practice of analysis." It also reflects a quarter of a century of "facts and experiences" since Estudios was published, evident in references to the works of O'Connor, Collins, Kugel, Watson and other contrib- utors to this growth area in biblical research, and to his own work on the Nueva Biblia Española and exegetical commentaries on every book in the OT. Alonso Schökel begins with a historical survey of literary approaches to the Bible, from ancient times when "the Israelites valued their texts and books not only as sacred texts but also as literary and poetic texts," to modern times where Robert Alter, Northrop Frye, and others have at last come to similar conclusions. Another introductory chapter tackles the question of "poetic genres," first "according to the Hebrews" (a cursory survey of šīr, māšāl , mizmõr, hîdâ, në^ûm, etc., in Biblical Hebrew), and then according to modern literary theory. Distinctions are drawn be- tween popular genres and learned genres, and between descriptive poetry (e.g., Psalm 104; Prov 31:10-31) and mythological poetry (e.g., Psalm 93; Isa 51:9-10), but not between poetry and artistic prose: "Purism is a symptom of decadence" (p. 19). 503</page><page sequence="2">504 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 52, 1990 Almost every page is marvellously illustrated with a wealth of examples from the Hebrew Bible (plus Ben Sira), some familiar, but many unnoticed by generations of modern scholars. The chapters on sounds and rhythm criticize the modern habit of "seeing" the biblical text without listening to it. A.S., working primarily from the sound of the language, argues that Hebrew poetic rhythm is based on units of ac- cented and unaccented syllables, which he calls "feet" (iambic, anapaestic, etc.), arranged in recurring patterns. There are obviously difficulties with this theory, not least the fact that we do not know exactly how ancient Hebrew was pronounced. But other theories are just as problematical, and certainly his analysis of worked examples (e.g., Ps 93:3-5; Isa 1:10-20; 7:14-16) is simple and effective. His handling of paral- lelism (with a brief appendix on "word-pairs"), synonymy, repetition, merismus, and antithesis is likewise marked by sensitivity to the text and a concern with the practical problems of understanding it in all its subtlety, rather than with theory and the views of other scholars. The most interesting and important chapter is the one on images. "Images are the glory, perhaps the essence of poetry ... a limitless galaxy, ever alive and ever changing" (p. 94). Again this is characterized by practical common sense as well as by careful study of the text. Long-established prejudices (especially in biblical stud- ies) about the "oriental imagination," the inferior status of poetic images over against abstract concepts or ideas, and the spiritualization of what is perceived by the senses (e.g., nepeš, "person, appetite, neck" as well as "soul, life") are roundly condemned. Most important of all, it is essential that the reader's imagination is "in working order" (p. 104) if some of the rich and often all too familiar images of biblical poetry (e.g., "dust," "breath," "passing shadow") are not to lose their force. An image is defined, with admirable simplicity, as "the placing alongside of two panels, at least one of which is perceived by the senses," and a modest attempt at classification leads to many valuable and illuminating comments on comparison, metaphor, allegory, symbol (including the prophets' symbolic actions), and parable. But it is the section on technique that is most original. In this A.S. first illustrates, by reference to Psalm 23, a technique whereby the poet stands as it were "at the point of intersection of the two panels . . . focusing in turn on one or the other. . . . Am- bivalence and indecision produce a curious and allusive vibration in the poem" (p. 1 14). He then looks at what he calls "explanation" (e.g., Ps 55:9-10: the last word "tongues" clarifies the preceding metaphor); development of an image (e.g., Ps 127:4- 5); grouping of images (e.g., Ps 124:2-5); diffusion (e.g., Ps 69:2,3,15,35); total trans- position (e.g., Isa 2:2-5) and "surrealist" visions or inventions (e.g., Isaiah 34; Zech 5:1-4). The chapter ends with a comprehensive and systematic collection of "Images and their Subjects," beginning with the animation of inanimate beings (floods, trees, stones, blood) and the personification of abstract qualities (love, justice, sin, wisdom, Sheol, death), and ending with images applied to humans (earth, air, trees, animals) and God (king, warrior, craftsman, shepherd, lion, eagle). There is necessarily some brief theological discussion of the via negativa, God in history, anthropomorphism, and so on, but strictly from the point of view of a literary critic and always related to the detailed exegesis of texts. The striking feminine imagery in Isaiah 40-66 is</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 505 conspicuous by its absence, but this is partially remedied by a brief reference on p. 185 and by A.S.'s splendid contribution to R. Alter and E Kermode, The Literary Guide to the Bible (Cambridge, MA: Belknap/ Harvard University, 1987) 165-83. Chapter 9 demonstrates how all the major classical "figures of speech" can be found in the Hebrew Bible: citation, allusion, rhetorical question, apostrophe, irony (including dramatic irony, sarcasm, oxymoron, paradox, double entendre, bur- lesque), ellipsis, hyperbole, litotes. Chap. 10 does the same for dialogue and mono- logue, and a final chapter on "Development and Composition" is a remarkably successful attempt to get inside the process that led from the poet's original inspi- ration or commissioning to the poems as we now have them. Such an accumulation of examples constitutes a challenge to commentators schooled in Gattungsgeschichte , Draditionsgeschichte, and Redaktionsgeschichte, but blissfully ignorant of the sub- tleties of biblical poetry, both stylistic and semantic. This is a "literary guide" which is delightfully free of needless theorizing, tech- nical jargon, and complicated diagrams, full of practical advice and exegetical skill. Three substantial indexes of biblical texts, authors, and subjects make it easy to use as a reference book as well as a "manual." It ends with the plea that students of the Bible can no longer neglect this type of literary analysis, and the Aristotelian prin- ciple that the best way to do it is to "see how clear-sighted and experienced experts analyze poems and learn by imitation." I hope the author includes himself in this category and that he will have many imitators. John E A. Sawyer, University of Newcastle upon fyne, Newcastle upon fyne, NEI 7 RU</page></plain_text>
