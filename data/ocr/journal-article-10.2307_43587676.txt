<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rosser • 1 The Next Millennium Is Now Here: Women's Studies Perspectives on Biotechnics and Reproductive Technologies by Sue V. Rosser Until recently, very little contact has occurred between the feminist and scien- tific communities. A handful of scien- tists (Bleier, 1984; Fausto-Sterling, 1992; Keller, 1983, 1985; Rosser, 1986; 1990) has worked in women's studies since the beginning of the second wave of femi- nism in the late 1960s, developing femi- nist critiques of science, pointing out gender bias in basic and clinical research, and evolving curricular and pedagogical techniques to attract and retain women in science. The mainstream community of scientists has remained unaware, or in some cases, has actively ignored or chal- lenged this feminist scholarship pro- duced by their scientific colleagues. Perhaps it is not too surprising that biology is the area within the natural and physical sciences which has experienced most interaction with women's studies and feminist critiques. Although biology of women and women's health courses have been taught for more than two decades at many U.S. universities, only within recent years have conferences and research agendas in the sciences begun to integrate women's studies and feminist perspectives. The Office of Women's Health Initiatives was established by the National Institutes of Health in 1991 (Pinn &amp; LaRosa, 1992), but women's health curricula are just now making their way into mainstream medical schools and specialty requirements. In May, 1996, I attended a Feminist Critique of the Human Genome Initiative1 conference funded by the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) part of the $3 billion Human Genome Initiative; seeds for develop- ment of curricula which would focus on women's perspectives or critiques of the HGI were planted in the minds of vari- ous conference attendees. I would like to explore the possibility of integration of gender into science and technology by looking at how feminisms, or moje accu- rately, different feminist theories, provide us with lenses to open new perspectives and provide insights into new ways of looking at research in biology and wom- en's health and their respective applica- tions in biotechnics and reproductive technologies. Sue V Rosser is the Director of the Center for Research on Women s Studies and Gender at the University of Florida in Gainesville where she is also Professor of Anthropology. Her Ph.D. is in Zoology from the University of Wisconsin in Madison. During 1995&gt; she served as Senior Project Officer for Women s Programs at the National Science Foundation and she is the author of seven books and 79 journal articles on theory and appli- cation issues of women in science and women's health.</page><page sequence="2">2 • Transformations - Individuals unfamiliar with femi- nism or women's studies often assume that feminist theory provides a singular and unified framework for analysis. In one sense this is correct; all feminist the- ory posits gender as a significant charac- teristic that interacts with other charac- teristics, such as race and class, to struc- ture relationships between individuals, within groups, and within society as a whole. However, using the lens of gen- der to view the world results in diverse images or theories: liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, socialist feminism, African-American feminism, lesbian separatist feminism, conservative or essentialist feminism, existentialist femi- nism, psychoanalytic feminism, radical feminism, postmodern, and post-colo- nial feminism. The variety and com- plexity of these various feminist theories provide a framework through which to explore research agendas in biology, health, biotechnics, and reproductive technologies. I will use these different feminist theories to examine the ques- tions each would raise in specific appli- cations to areas of research in biology and health. For the applications in biol- ogy, I will draw examples from the Human Genome Initiative (HGI) and genetic engineering of agricultural species; for health, the reproductive technologies of amniocentesis and in vitro fertilization serve as examples. LIBERAL FEMINISM Beginning in the eighteenth centu- ry, political scientists, philosophers, and feminists [Friedan, 1974; Jaggar, 1983; Mill (John Stuart), 1970; Mill (Harriet Taylor), 1970; Wollstonecraft, 1975] have described the parameters of liberal feminism. The differences between nineteenth-century and twentieth-cen- tury liberal feminists have varied from libertarian to egalitarian, and numerous complexities exist among definitions of liberal feminists today. However, a gen- eral definition of liberal feminism is the belief that women are suppressed in contemporary society because they suf- fer unjust discrimination (Jaggar, 1983). Liberal feminists seek no special privi- leges for women and simply demand that everyone receive equal considera- tion without discrimination on the basis of sex. Most scientists would assume that the implications of liberal feminism for the sciences revolve solely around removal of documented overt and covert barriers (Matyas and Malcom, 1991; NSF, 1992; Rosser, 1990; Rossiter, 1984; Vetter, 1988, 1991, 1996) that have prevented women from entering and succeeding in science. Most scientists, even those who are brave enough to call themselves femi- nists, assume that the implications of liberal feminism extend only to employ- ment, access, and discrimination issues. In fact, the implications of liberal feminism extend beyond this. Liberal feminism shares two fundamental assumptions with the foundations of the traditional method for scientific discov- ery: (1) Both assume that human</page><page sequence="3">Rosser • 3 beings are highly individualistic and obtain knowledge in a rational manner that may be separated from their social conditions; and (2) Both accept posi- tivism as the theory of knowledge. Positivism implies that "all knowledge is constructed by inference from immedi- ate sensory experiences" (Jaggar, 1983, pp. 355-356). These two assumptions lead to the belief in the possibilities of obtaining knowledge that is both objective and value-free, concepts which form the cor- nerstones of the scientific method. Objectivity is contingent upon value neutrality or freedom from values, inter- ests, and emotions associated with a par- ticular class, race, or sex. Although each scientist strives to be as objective and value-free as possible, most scientists, feminists, and philosophers of science recognize that no individual can be neu- tral or value-free. Instead, "objectivity is defined to mean independence from the value judgments of any particular indi- vidual" (Jaggar, 1983, p. 357). Liberal feminism implies that once barriers are removed and women receive equal con- sideration without discrimination on the basis of sex in science, women will con- stitute 45% of scientists, since that is their proportion in the overall workforce population. Liberal feminism also implies that this proportional represen- tation will be achieved without changes in science itself, except for the removal of barriers, and that women scientists, just as their male counterparts, will perceive the sensations and experiences upon which their empirical observations are based separately and individually, while controlling their own values, interests, and emotions. In the past two decades feminist his- torians and philosophers of science (Fee, 1982; Haraway, 1990; Harding, 1986) and feminist scientists (Birke, 1986; Bleier, 1984, 1986; Fausto-Sterling, 1992; Hubbard, 1990; Keller, 1983, 1985; Rosser, 1988; Spanier, 1982) have pointed out a source of bias and absence of value neutrality in science, particular- ly biology. By excluding females as experimental subjects, focusing on prob- lems of primary interest to males, faulty experimental designs, and interpreta- tions of data based on language or ideas constricted by patriarchal parameters, experimental results in several areas in biology have been demonstrated to be biased or flawed. For example, much of the early work in primatology suffered from problems of selective use of species, anthropomorphic and vague language, and universalizing and extrapolating beyond the limits warranted by the data. Yerkes stated clearly in his early work (1943) that he had chosen particular primate species such as the baboon and chimpanzee because their social organi- zation, in his eyes, resembled that of human primates. Subsequent researchers tended to forget the "obvious" limita- tions imposed by such selection of species and proceeded to generalize the data to universal behavior patterns for all primates. It was not until a signifi-</page><page sequence="4">4 • Transformations _ cant number of women entered prima- tology that the concepts of the univer- sality and male leadership of dominance hierarchies among primates (Lancaster, 1975; Leavitt, 1975; Leibowitz, 1975; Rowell, 1974) were questioned and shown to be inaccurate for many species. In addition to the problems of selec- tive use of species, anthropomorphic and vague language, and universalizing and extrapolating beyond limits of the data, feminist scientists revealed another obvious flaw in much animal behavior research: failure to study females. When females were studied, it was usually only in their interaction (usually reaction) to males or infants. Presumably the fact that until recently most animal behavior researchers were male resulted in an androcentric bias in the conceptualiza- tion of design for observation of animal behavior. Because male researchers had only experienced male-male and male- female interactions themselves, their male world view prohibited them from realizing that female-female interaction might be observed in their own and other species. Female primatologists (Fossey, 1983; Goodall, 1971) and sociobiolo- gists (Hrdy, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1984, 1986) revealed new information that led to the overthrow of previously held the- ories regarding dominance hierarchies, mate selection, (Hrdy, 1984) and female-female competition (Hrdy and Williams, 1983) by focusing on female- female interactions. These and other examples of flawed research resulting from the critiques of feminists have raised fundamental ques- tions regarding gender and good science: Do these examples simply represent "bad science"? Is good science really gender-free and/or does the scientific method when properly used permit research that is objective and unbiased? Liberal feminism suggests that now that the bias of gender has been revealed by feminist critiques, scientists can take this into account and correct for this value or bias which had not previously been uncovered. It implies that good sci- entific research is not conducted differ- ently by men and women and that in principle men can be just as good femi- nists as women and that women can be just as good scientists as men. Now that feminist critiques have revealed flaws in research due to gender bias, both men and women will use this revelation to design experiments, gather and interpret data, and draw conclusions and theories that are more objective and free from bias, including gender bias (Biology and Gender Study Group, 1989). Once aware of the bias, research might be designed and directed equally well by men or women scientists to illustrate the gender-free nature of science. Liberal feminism also does not ques- tion the integrity of the scientific method itself or of its supporting corol- laries of objectivity and value neutrality. Liberal feminism reaffirms the idea that it is possible to find a perspective from which to observe that is truly impartial, rational, and detached. Lack of objec- tivity and presence of bias occur because</page><page sequence="5">Rosser • 5 of human failure to properly follow the scientific method and avoid bias due to situation or condition. Liberal feminists argue that it was through attempts to become more value-neutral that the pos- sible androcentrism in previous scientific research has been revealed. Applications of liberal feminism to current research agendas and their trans- lation into practice and products might lead to the following sorts of changes: Equal numbers of women would be involved in setting the research agenda for the Human Genome Initiative. Women scientists would have equal access to the grant moneys and sequenc- ing equipment provided by the HGI, instead of the current male dominance of such resources. Because of their aware- ness of potential androcentric bias such as the possibility of increased interest in mapping genes for diseases causing increased mortality and morbidity in men, both men and women scientists would strive to eliminate such bias from research designs and interpretations of data. In their attempts to assess the ben- efits of new or improved species devel- oped through biotechnology, they would consider the impacts on women's lives. For example, liberal feminists would ask whether the new, larger vegetable really does have the nutritive value and taste of the biologically unmodified species, and that this be considered along with factors such as resistance to pests and higher yield per acre. Equal numbers of men and women would develop new reproductive tech- nologies. In contrast to the current sit- uation in which most fertility technolo- gies such as hormone injections, super- ovulation, in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), etc., center on the female, while the sperm count/assessment is the primary technology for the male, the number and degree of invasiveness of the tech- nologies would be the same for both men and women. Similarly, equal num- bers of kinds of contraceptives with sim- ilar risks would be developed for both men and women. Equal numbers of male offspring to female offspring would be aborted based upon sex selec- tion after chorionic villi sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. In contrast to liberal feminism, all other feminist theories call into question the fundamental assumptions underly- ing the scientific method, its corollaries of objectivity and value neutrality, or its implications. They reject individualism for a social construction of knowledge and question positivism and the possi- bility of objectivity obtained by value- neutrality. Many also imply that men and women may conduct scientific research differently, although each theo- ry posits a different cause for the gender distinction. SOCIALIST FEMINISM Socialist feminism serves as the clearest example of a feminist theory that contrasts with liberal feminism in its rejection of individualism and posi- tivism as approaches to knowledge.</page><page sequence="6">6 • Transformations - Marxist critiques of science form the his- torical precursors and foundations for socialist feminist critiques. Marxism views all knowledge as socially con- structed and emerging from practical human involvement in production that takes a definite historic form. According to Marxism, knowledge, including sci- entific knowledge, cannot be solely indi- vidualistic. Since knowledge is a produc- tive activity of human beings, it cannot be objective and value free because the basic categories of knowledge are shaped by human purposes and values. Marxism proposes that the form of knowledge is determined by the prevail- ing mode of production. In the twenti- eth-century United States, according to Marxism, scientific knowledge would be determined by capitalism and reflect the interests of the dominant class. The billions of dollars spent on the Human Genome Initiative would be interpreted by Marxists as reflecting the interests of the dominant class. The focus on genes and the considerable publicity which surrounds the isolation and copying of "disease genes" suggests to most lay people that most disease is not only biologically determined but more specifically that it is genetically caused. This diverts valuable research dollars away from environmental causes of, and contributions to, disease and from public health, long demonstrated to be more effective in eradicating most communicable and other diseases than the high tech solutions evolved by med- ical research. Centering on genes also places responsibility on the individual and takes it away from the system and broader society. Socialist feminist critiques become most visible in their application to spe- cific biotechnics and reproductive tech- nologies. The decisions regarding which products are developed from the numerous patented genes isolated and sequenced by the biotechnic industries fall under the influence of capitalist interests in profit margins as much as they attend to the needs for nutritious foods of people in developing countries. The capabilities opened by in vitro fer- tilization have led to an industry in which poor women are paid to gestate the developing fetus, who may represent the genetic offspring of a rich man and woman who does not wish to and/or can t carry a pregnancy to term - the so- called Baby M phenomenon (Raymond, 1991). A California judge ruled that the woman gestating the fetus derived from another woman's egg is comparable to a baby sitter and that the egg-donor is the biological mother (Hubbard, 1995). On a world-wide scale, particularly in India and China, amniocentesis is used for sex selection to abort more female than male children, because traditional- ly in those cultures, sons are valued more, partially because of their econom- ic contribution to the family income and to the care of their elderly parents. A person born in an overdeveloped country consumes about thirty times as much as a person in an underdeveloped country (Corea, 1991). Despite the fact</page><page sequence="7">Rosser • 7 that children born in industrialized, first-world countries use more of the worlds resources, women from first world countries, especially middle class ones, are encouraged to have children while women in third world countries are sterilized against their will. Infertility becomes the issue in first world coun- tries (Klein, 1989; Muller, 1992), while fertility signals the problem in develop- ing countries (Eschen &amp; Whittaker, 1993). In strict Marxist feminism, where class is emphasized over gender, only bourgeois (liberal) feminism or proletar- ian feminism can exist. A bourgeois woman scientist would be expected to produce scientific knowledge that would be similar to that produced by a bour- geois man scientist but which would be different from that produced by a prole- tarian woman scientist. Some of the data (Holloway, 1993) demonstrating that many other countries, including many less developed countries, produce a high- er percentage of women scientists than the United States, might be explained using a Marxist-feminist analysis. In many of these countries such as the Philippines, Brazil, Turkey, India, Portugal, and Thailand, class may be a more significant factor than gender for distinguishing who goes into science (Barinaga, 1994). Socialist feminism places class and gender on equal ground as factors that determine the position and perspective of a particular individual in society. Socialist feminism asserts that the special position of women within (or as) a class gives them a special standpoint that pro- vides them with a particular world view. This world view from the standpoint of women is supposed to be more reliable and less distorted than that of men from the same class. Implicit in the accep- tance of the social construction of knowledge is the rejection of the stand- point of the neutral, disinterested observer of liberal feminism. Because the prevailing knowledge and science reflect the interests and values of the dominant class and gender, they have an interest in concealing, and may, in fact, not recognize the way they dominate. Women oppressed by both class and gender have an advantageous and more comprehensive view of reality. Because of their oppression, they have an interest in perceiving problems with the status quo and the science and knowledge pro- duced by the dominant class and gen- der. Simultaneously, their position requires them to understand the science and condition of the dominant group in order to survive. Thus, the standpoint of the oppressed comprehends and includes that of the dominant group, so it is more accurate. An example that might be cast as socialist feminism is the current work of the National Breast Cancer Coalition in the United States. Dissatisfied with the research direction and solutions provid- ed by the modern medical establish- ment, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, made up of over 250 organi- zations nation-wide, presented the</page><page sequence="8">8 • Transformations - President and First Lady on October 18, 1993, with petitions containing 2.6 mil- lion signatures demanding a compre- hensive strategy plan to end the breast cancer epidemic (WCCP, 1994). In 1992, the Women's Community Cancer Project presented A Woman s Cancer Agenda : The Demands to the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Government, asking for alternative treatments and research into environ- mental causes for the breast cancer epi- demic in addition to the radiation, chemo-therapy, and high tech medical focus of current treatments and research (WCCP, 1992). AFRICAN-AMERICAN/ WOMANIST AND RACIAL/ ETHNIC FEMINISM Like socialist feminism, African- American/womanist or racial/ethnic feminism also rejects individualism and positivism for social construction as an approach to knowledge. It is based on the African-American critique of a Eurocentric approach to knowledge. In addition to the rejection of objectivity and value-neutrality associated with the positivist approach accepted by liberal feminism, African-American approaches critique dichotomization of knowledge, or at least the identification of science with the first half and African-American with the latter half of the following dichotomies: culture/ nature; rational / feeling; objective/ subjective; quantita- tive/qualitative; active/passive; focused/ diffuse; independent/dependent; mind/ body, self/others; knowing/being. African- American critiques also question meth- ods that distance the observer from the object of study, thereby denying a facet of the social construction of knowledge. Whereas Marxism posits class as the organizing principle around which the struggle for power exists, African- American critiques maintain that race is the primary oppression. African Americans critical of the scientific enter- prise may view it as a function of white Eurocentric interests. Some of the earli- est applications of gene testing centered around the sickle cell disease, concentrat- ed primarily in the African-American population in the U.S.. This proved to have negative consequences in terms of denial of insurance benefits, employment opportunities, and stigmas due to misun- derstanding of the differences between carriers of the gene and individuals with the disease. This large-scale project recalls former scientific/medical initia- tives such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment in the United States (Jones, 1981) or the testing of high estrogen birth control pills in Puerto Rico (Zimmerman, 1980), in which the bod- ies of people of color became the test sites for drugs and diseases thought to be too dangerous for testing in the white popu- lation. Because of these problems, ethnic populations have been in the forefront voicing the potential problems surround- ing issues of privacy and access to the information derived from genetic testing. Not surprisingly, some view the Human Genome Initiative as providing</page><page sequence="9">Rosser • 9 a further opportunity for genocide of ethnic populations. The Human Genome Diversity Project, which sam- ples indigenous and other "vanishing" tribal populations, may be viewed from an ethnic perspective as an attempt to preserve genes, while allowing the people themselves to become extinct. Similarly, genetic samples of indigenous varieties of plants and animals from the third world are preserved by scientists from the first world, while they simultaneously intro- duce Western agricultural methods, including genetically engineered crops, which destroy acres of habitat and species at the rate of one per day from the tropical forests in many third world countries (Shiva, 1988). Just as Marxists view class oppres- sion as primary and superseding gender oppression, African-American critiques place race above gender as an oppression. A strict, traditional interpretation of African-American critiques would sug- gest that scientific knowledge produced by African-American women would more closely resemble scientific knowl- edge produced by African-American men than that produced by white women. In contrast, African-American feminist critiques (Giddings, 1984; Hooks, 1981, 1983, 1990; Lorde, 1984) assert that in contemporary society, women suffer oppression due to their gender, as well as to their race. For African-American women, racism and sexism become intertwining oppressions which provide them with a different per- spective and standpoint than that of either white women or African- American men. ESSENTIALIST FEMINISM Essentialist feminist theory posits that women are different from men because of their biology, specifically their secondary sex characteristics and their reproductive systems. Frequently, essen- tialist feminism may extend to include gender differences in visual-spatial and verbal ability, aggression and other behavior, and other physical and mental traits based on prenatal or pubertal hor- mone exposure. Nineteenth-century essentialist feminists [Blackwell, (1895) 1976; Calkins, 1896; Tanner, 1896] often accepted the ideas of male essen- tialist scientists such as Freud [anatomy is destiny (1924)] or Darwin (as inter- preted by the social Darwinists) that there are innate differences between men and women. These nineteenth-century essentialist feminists proposed that the biologically-based gender differences meant that women were inferior to men in some physical (Blackwell, 1976; Smith-Rosenberg, 1975) and mental (Hollingsworth, 1914; Tanner, 1896) traits, but that they were superior in oth- ers. Biological essentialism formed the basis for the supposed moral superiority of women which nineteenth-century suf- fragettes (DuBois, Kelly, Kennedy, Korsmeyer, &amp; Robinson, 1985; Hartmann and Banner, 1974) used as a persuasive argument for giving women the vote. In the earlier phases of the current</page><page sequence="10">10 • Transformations wave of feminism, most feminist scien- tists (Bleier, 1979; Fausto-Sterling, 1985; Hubbard, 1979; Rosser, 1982) fought against some sociobiological research such as that by Wilson (1975), Trivers (1972), and Dawkins (1976) and some hormone and brain lateralization research (Buffery and Gray, 1972; Gorski, Harlan, Jacobson, Shryne, and Southam, 1980; Goy and Phoenix, 1971; Sperry, 1974) which seemed to provide biological evidence for differ- ences in mental and behavioral charac- teristics between males and females, since difference typically became inter- preted as male superiority Essentialism was seen as a tool for conservatives who wished to keep women in the home and out of the work place. More recently, feminists have re-examined essentialism from perspectives ranging from conserv- ative to radical (Corea, 1985; Dworkin, 1983; MacKinnon, 1982, 1987; O'Brien, 1981; Rich, 1976) with a recognition that biologically-based dif- ferences between the sexes might imply superiority and power for women in some arenas. Essentialist feminism would imply that because of their biology, differential hormonal effects on the brain, the phys- ical experiences of menstrual cycles, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, and menopause, and/or other differing anatomical or physiological characteris- tics, female scientists would produce a different science from that of men. It seems logical and understandable that due to their biological experiences, women might be interested in different problems than men. However, essential- ism would imply that these differences would lead them to different methods in approaching these problems, that is, experiencing menstruation might lead women to different methods than those used by men for studying menstruation. Some individuals who might be cat- egorized as essentialist, and possibly as conservative, push for more research which would result in discoveries such as the 1994 isolation and copying of the BRCA1 gene, located on chromosome 17ql2-21, which causes an 85% risk of breast cancer when it mutates (Shattuck- Edens, et al., 1995). In the case of the BRCA1 gene, the focus on genetic caus- es of cancer, leading to testing in some families and in women who have the gene, may result in radical mastectomies before any sign of cancer is detected. Essentialists, who might be seen as extreme biological determinists, would push for more women scientists to be involved in this research to ensure that more of the HGI dollars would be directed towards isolation of genetic dis- eases particularly problematic for women. For similar reasons, they would want women involved in the develop- ment of reproductive technologies. Some of the more radical essential- ists identify with ecofeminism. Merchant (1979) and Griffin (1978, 1989) begin their documentation of sci- ences historical roots with the seven- teenth-century shift from an organic hermetic approach to science in which</page><page sequence="11">Rosser • 11 men revered and saw themselves as part of the environment and nature (and women as identified with nature), to a mechanistic, objective approach in which the objective distance endorsed mens domination and ©exploitation of the environment (and women) (Keller, 1985). Ecofeminists have made explicit the connection between the domination of both women and the environment through the androcentrism of modern science (Harding, 1986; King, 1983, 1989). Such ecofeminists would pro- pose that women, because of their essen- tial identification with nature, would develop biotechnologies less harmful to the environment. EXISTENTIALIST FEMINISM Existentialist feminism, first elabo- rated by Simone de Beauvoir (1974), suggests that women's "otherness" and the social construction of gender rest on society's interpretation of biological dif- ferences, rather than on the actual bio- logical differences themselves: The enslavement of the female to the species and the limitations of her various powers are extremely important facts; the body of woman is one of the essential ele- ments in her situation in the world. But that body is not enough to define her as woman; there is no true living reality except as mani- fested by the conscious individual through activities and in the bosom of a society. Biology is not enough to give an answer to the question that is before us: why is woman the other? (de Beauvoir, 1974, p.51) In other words, it is the value that society assigns to biological differences between males and females which has led woman to play the role of the Other (Tong, 1989); it is not the biological differences themselves. The philosoph- ical origins of feminism emphasize that it is man's conception of woman as "other" that has led to his willingness to dominate and exploit her. It results in the view of the male norm in drug test- ing and the view of the female as "other" or deviant from the male norm. Some examples suggest that man's view of woman as other stretches to the point that his interactions and treatment of her are similar to his interactions with another, lower species. Ecofeminists coming from an exis- tentialist perspective would suggest that they should be involved in biotechnolo- gy and reproductive technology devel- opment, not because of their biological essentialism, but because they and other species have been dominated and treat- ed as "other" by men and male scien- tists. Individuals, both male and female, from the disability rights movements have made similar arguments for why they should be actively involved in the HGI and other biotechnology develop- ments. They also point out that the potential and actual elimination of dis- abilities caused by genetic defects increases pressure for persons with dis- abilities to be perceived as "other" and decreases pressures for the society to</page><page sequence="12">12 • Transformations - provide services for disabled people. PSYCHOANALYTIC FEMINISM In many ways, psychoanalytic femi- nism takes a stance similar to that of existentialist feminism. Derived from Freudian theory, psychoanalysis posits that girls and boys develop contrasting gender roles because they experience their sexuality differently and deal differ- ently with the stages of psychosexual development. Based on the Freudian prejudice that anatomy is destiny, psy- choanalytic theory assumes that biologi- cal sex will lead to different ways for boys and girls to resolve the Oedipus and castration complexes which arise during the phallic stage of normal sexu- al development. As was the situation with existentialism, psychoanalysis rec- ognizes that gender construction is not biologically essential; in "normal" gen- der construction the nature of the child- caretaker interaction differs depending on the sex of the child (and possibly that of the primary caretaker). However, psychoanalytic theory is not strictly bio- logically deterministic since cases of "abnormal" sexuality may result when gender construction is opposite or not congruent with biological sex. In recent years, a number of femi- nists have become interested again in Freud s theories, after a period of attack- ing Freudian and successor analytic the- ories (Firestone, 1970; Friedan, 1974; Millett, 1970). Rejecting the biological determinism in Freud, Dinnerstein (1977) and Chodorow (1978) in partic- ular have used an aspect of psychoana- lytic theory known as object relations theory to examine the construction of gender and sexuality. Chodorow and Dinnerstein examine the Oedipal stage of psychosexual development to deter- mine why the construction of gender and sexuality in this stage usually results in male dominance. They conclude that the gender differences resulting in male dominance can be traced to the fact that in our society, women are the primary caretakers for most infants and children. Accepting most Freudian ideas about the Oedipus complex, Chodorow and Dinnerstein conclude that boys are pushed to be independent, distant, and autonomous from their female caretak- ers while girls are permitted to be more dependent, intimate, and less individu- ated from their mothers or female care- takers. Building upon the work of Chodorow and Dinnerstein, feminists (Harding, 1986; Hein, 1981; Keller, 1982) have explored how the gender identity proposed by object relations theory with women as caretakers might lead to more men choosing careers in science. Keller (1982; 1985), in particular, applied the work of Chodorow and Dinnerstein to suggest how science has become a masculine province which excludes women and causes women to exclude themselves from it. Science is a masculine province not only in the fact that it is populated mostly by men but also in the choice of experimental top-</page><page sequence="13">____ _ Rosser • 13 ics, use of male subjects for experimenta- tion, interpretation and theorizing from data, as well as in the practice and appli- cations of science undertaken by the sci- entists. Keller suggests (1982; 1985) that since the scientific method stresses objectivity, rationality, distance, and autonoiny of the observer from the object of study (i.e., the positivist neutral observer), individuata jwhofçel comfort- able with independence, autonomy, and ^ distance will be most likely to become scientists. Because most caretakers dur- ing the Oedipal phase are female, most individuals in our culture who will be comfortable as scientists are those who have been pushed to be independent, distant, and autonomous (i.e., they will be male). The type of science they create will also, in turn, reflect those same char- acteristics of independence, distance, and autonomy. It is upon this basis that feminists have suggested that the objec- tivity and rationality of science are syn- onymous with a male approach to the physical, natural world. Psychoanalytic feminism implies that less separation between the develop- ers and users of bio- and reproductive technologies would benefit both scien- tists and the women and other people who experience the effects of the tech- nologies. For example, the current med- ical/research model has led to the need for a group of professionals, the genetic counselors, who explain the results and implications of tests and technologies to "consumers" who then must decide whether to have a mastectomy because they carry the BCRA1 gene, abort a child when the amniocentesis suggests that it would have spina bifida, or elect not to have "genetic" children at all because of the results of tests indicating a certain statistical probability that genes they carry may lead to the pro- duction of a "defective" offspring. Psychoanalytic feminists would propose that having women, people with disabil- ities, and individuals from developing countries involved in the design and funding decision stages of genetic research would lead to more appropriate technologies, while also informing the "consumers" more accurately of the implications of the technologies. RADICAL FEMINISM Radical feminism, in contrast to psychoanalytic feminism and liberal feminism, rejects the possibility of a gender-free science or a science devel- oped from a neutral, objective perspec- tive. Radical feminism maintains that women's oppression is the first, most widespread, and deepest oppression (Jaggar and Rothenberg, 1984). Since men dominate and control most institu- tions, politics, and knowledge in our society, they reflect a male perspective and are effective in oppressing women. Scientific institutions, practice, and knowledge are particularly male-domi- nated and have been documented by many feminists (Bleier, 1984; Fee, 1982; Griffin, 1978; Haraway, 1978, 1990; Hubbard, 1990; Keller, 1985; Merchant, 1979; Rosser, 1990) to be</page><page sequence="14">14 • Transformations __ especially effective patriarchal tools to control and harm women. Radical fem- inism rejects most scientific theories, data, and experiments precisely because they not only exclude women but also because they are not women-centered. The theory that radical feminism proposes is evolving (Tong, 1989) and is not as well developed as some of the other feminist theories for reasons springing fairly directly from the nature of radical feminism itself. First it is rad- ical. That means that it rejects most currently accepted ideas about scientific epistemology - what kinds of things can be known, who can be a knower, and how beliefs are legitimated as knowledge - and methodology - the general structure of how theory finds its application in particular scientific disci- plines. Second, unlike the feminisms previously discussed, radical feminism does not have its basis in a theory such as Marxism, positivism, psychoanalysis, or existentialism, already developed for decades by men. Since radical femi- nism is based in women's experience, it rejects feminisms rooted in theories developed by men based on their expe- rience and world view. Third, the the- ory of radical feminism must be devel- oped by women and based in women's experience (MacKinnon, 1987). Because radical feminism maintains that the oppression of women is the deepest, most widespread, and histori- cally first oppression, women have had few opportunities to come together, understand their experiences collective- ly, and develop theories based on those experiences. Radical feminism deviates consider- ably from other feminisms in its view of how beliefs are legitimated as knowl- edge. A successful strategy that women use to obtain reliable knowledge and correct distortions of patriarchal ideolo- gy is the consciousness-raising group (Jaggar, 1983). Using their personal experiences as a basis, women meet together in communal, non-hierarchical groups to examine their experiences to determine what counts as knowledge (MacKinnon, 1987). If radical feminists would find biotechnics and reproductive technolo- gies acceptable, the requests for their development, research design, and applications would originate from con- sciousness-raising groups in which women discuss their experiences to determine which, if any, technologies should be developed. Although the ori- gin and development of the technology of the contraceptive device known as the cervical cap certainly did not come from women's consciousness-raising groups, its recent testing in the U.S. might be seen as an example of the impact and use of such groups. Reintroduced into the United States from Europe in the 1970s, the cervical cap was required to go through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process (Muller, 1992), since it had been off the market for several decades. In addition to the typical route for approval of clin- ical trials and double-blind studies, the</page><page sequence="15">Rosser • 15 FDA permitted women's health clinics and collectives to serve as test sites for approval of the device. Since such clin- ics and collectives often originated from women's consciousness-raising groups, this might be construed as a glimpse of how radical feminists might impact bio- and reproductive technologies. LESBIAN SEPARATISM Lesbian separatism, often seen as an offshoot of radical feminism, would sug- gest that separation from men is neces- sary in a patriarchal society for females to understand their experiences and explore the potentials of science and the impacts of reproductive technologies. Lesbian separatist theory provides a con- text which reveals why patriarchal soci- ety encourages the use of technologies for sex selection which leads to the abor- tion of female fetuses, why a heterosexist society only permits heterosexual women who are married to men to receive artificial insemination, and why significant research dollars are poured into the search for "gay genes." In addi- tion to explaining these current prac- tices, lesbian separatist feminism sug- gests that in the absence of a patriarchal society which enforces compulsory het- erosexuality (Rich, 1980), very different bio- and reproductive technologies might be developed, if they would be permitted at all. For example, resources might be put into research on partheno- genesis, so that two women might have a child of whom they would share the genetic parentage. POST-MODERN FEMINISM Jn the earlier discussion of liberal feminism in this paper, I emphasized its fundamental assumptions of individual- ism and positivism and the extent to which the traditional method for scien- tific discovery also shares these two assumptions. Based upon liberal humanism (Rothfield, 1990), which suggests that the self is an individual, autonomous, self-constitutive human being, liberal feminists (Grimshaw, 1986; Lloyd, 1984; Tapper, 1986) cri- tique liberal humanism for its implicit assumption that the abstract individual is male or congruent with man. While criticizing liberal humanists for inap- propriately universalizing what are real- ly characteristics of men to all individu- als, both male and female, liberal femi- nists do not reject or critique other aspects of liberal humanism such as equality and freedom of the individual (Rothfield, 1990). Liberal feminism suggests that women have a unified voice and can be universally addressed (Gunew, 1990). In contrast to liberal humanism, post-modernism problematizes the self in "decentered modes of discourse. The self is no longer regarded as self-consti- tutive, but rather as a production of, variously, ideology, discourse, the struc- ture of the unconscious, and/or lan- guage" (Rothfield, 1990, p. 132). At least some post-modern feminists (Cixous and Clement, 1986; Kristeva, 1984, 1987) further suggest that the woman, having been marginalized by a</page><page sequence="16">16 * Transformations dominant male discourse, may be in a privileged position, that of outsider to the discourse that might otherwise threaten to rigidify all thought along pre- viously established lines. Perhaps women can find the holes in what appeared solid, sure, and unified. In short, post-modernism dissolves the uni- versal subject, and post-modern femi- nism dissolves the possibility that women speak in a unified voice or that they can be universally addressed. Race, class, nationality, sexual orientation, and other factors prevent such unity and uni- versality. Although one woman may share certain characteristics and experi- ences with other women because of her biological sex, her particular race, class, and sexual differences compared to other women, along with the construction of gender that her country and society give to someone living in her historical peri- od, prevent universalizing of her experi- ences to women in general. Insofar as post-modern feminism questions the nature of understanding the subject as defined in the Western world, it also puts the entire edifice of knowledge into question. This questioning may create the cracks or openings through which the marginalized woman might be able to walk. Post-modern feminist theories imply that no universal research agenda or application of bio- or reproductive tech- nologies will be appropriate and that var- ious women will have different reactions to the technologies depending upon their own class, race, sexual orientation, country, and other factors. Because post- modernism recognizes different, yet valid, standpoints from which various individuals view the same activities, the theory is often criticized (Butler and Scott, 1992) for leading to political inactivity. Post-modern feminists would be unlikely to have a unified position on a biological research agenda, applica- tions of various reproductive technolo- gies, or whether bio- or reproductive technologies should be pursued at all. Post-modern feminism may explain why many feminists oppose IVF and other reproductive technologies, while many women eagerly seek them out in their desire to overcome infertility and pro- duce "perfect" children. POST-COLONIAL FEMINISM Beginning in 1947, following vari- ous campaigns of anti-colonial resis- tance, often with an explicitly national- ist basis, many colonial empires formal- ly dissolved and previously colonized countries gained independence (Williams and Chrisman, 1994). Although the end of colonial rule creat- ed high hope for a proper post-colonial era, the extent to which the West had not relinquished control became clear quickly. The continuing Western influ- ence, particularly in the economic arena, but also in the political, ideological, and military sectors, became known as neo- colonialism by Marxists (Williams and Chrisman, 1994). Feminists have sug- gested that patriarchy dominates post- colonial and neo-colonial, much as it</page><page sequence="17">Rosser • 17 dominated colonial, everyday life. Not surprisingly, scientific research, biotechnics, and reproductive technolo- gies reflect the varying complex aspects of the inter-relationship among devel- oped and developing countries in gener- al and between the particular cultures of the colonized and colonizing country. General themes include the underdevel- opment of the third world by Europe and the West (Harding, 1995), ignoring, obscuring, or misappropriating earlier scientific achievements and history of third world countries, the fascination with so-called "indigenous science," and the recognition that third world coun- tries must become scientifically and technologically literate to join and com- pete in a global economy. The particular forms and ways that these general themes take shape and play out varies, depending upon the history, culture, geography and length of colo- nization for both the colonized and col- onizing countries. For example, the issues surrounding post-colonial science vary considerably between India and Kenya. Although both India and Kenya were colonized by the British, the differ- ences in indigenous cultures, geogra- phies, and length of time since indepen- dence have led to remarkably different problems and uses of modern science and technology. For example, in India, amniocentesis has been used for sex determination to abort undesired female fetuses. The particularities of Indian culture, economics, and religion (in which sons are highly valued, the elderly are cared for by sons, and dowry prices to find a good marriage partner for daughters can be very expensive) encourage this use of amniocentesis. In Kenya, in contrast, the indigenous cul- ture (through polygamy, valuing of chil- dren in general, and agricultural pro- duction) discourages such sex selection and abortion. In both countries, genetically-bred agricultural species have been intro- duced in the context of "green revolu- tions." Although increasing crop yields in the short run, in the long run, these revolutions often prove ecologically and economically disastrous, particularly for women. For example, introduction of hybrid corn and high yielding varieties of wheat necessitates introduction of Western farming methods such as use of tractors and harvesters. To plant the fields, forests must be cleared. As species are removed, biodiversity is lost. These crops also quickly deplete the soil of nutrients which must be replaced by expensive fertilizers. The accompany- ing changes in the ecosystem lead to droughts and less water. Women must walk further each day to obtain water for their families; they must walk partic- ularly far to obtain water unpolluted by agricultural run-off. Post-colonial femi- nism would suggest that indigenous peoples, including both individuals who have not left the country, as well as the elite, educated in the colonizing and other countries, should help to steer the research and applications of bio- and reproductive technologies.</page><page sequence="18">18 • Transformations - CONCLUSION As feminism has matured during this wave of its development in the lat- ter half of the twentieth century, femi- nist theory has become increasing com- plex. Springing from a growing knowl- edge that the diversity among women meant that the universalism suggested by liberal feminism was not appropriate to describe the experiences of all women, other feminist theories evolved. Although essentialist and existential feminism might be interpreted to imply that biological sex and its interpretation in our society provide an overriding sim- ilarity to the experiences of all women, other feminist theories suggest that other factors may be equally or more important than sex/gender. Marxist feminism emphasizes the importance of class as well as gender. African- American and other racial/ethnic theo- ries of feminism underline the signifi- cance of both race and gender/sex. Family dynamics and the role of the pri- mary caretaker become powerful deter- minants in psychoanalytic feminism, while radical feminism questions all cat- egories and knowledge developed in a patriarchal society in which women are oppressed. Post-modern feminism sug- gests that each woman in each society during a particular historical period may have a differing standpoint from which to view the world as shaped by her race, class, and numerous other factors, including her gender. Post-colonial fem- inism calls attention to the significance of the inter-relationship between the col- onizing and colonized countries and the influence of patriarchy in each. As biological research and its appli- cations to biotechnics and reproductive technologies have evolved, they too have become increasingly complex. The lens- es of feminist theories provide a variety of perspectives through which such research and its implementation may be viewed to ensure broader inclusion in both research design and application.</page><page sequence="19">Rosser • 19 NOTES 1 The Human Genome Initiative is a three billion dollar project funded by the National Institutes of Health in cooperation with other scientific sources from around the world.
