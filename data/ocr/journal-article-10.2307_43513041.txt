<plain_text><page sequence="1">Object Lessons: Wharton's The Custom of the Country and the New Connoisseurship Mary V Marchand Goucher College Near the end of Edith Wharton's 1913 novel The Custom of the Country, Undine Spragg helps Elmer Moffatt gain access to the pri- vate collections of the French aristocracy: She saw that the things he looked at moved him in a way she could not understand, and that the actual touching of rare textures - bronze or marble, or velvets flushed with the bloom of age - gave him sensations like those her own beauty had once roused in him. (818) "Some of his enjoyments," she concludes, "were beyond her range" (818). This acknowledgement gives rise to two related puzzles, both of which this essay tries to solve. What significance are we to attach to Undine's insensibility to beautiful objects, and why does Wharton endow Undine's male counterpart with this capacity for "aes- thetic emotions" (818)? The first question is sharpened by the realization that despite her preternatural gifts for imitation and adaptation, Undine's inability to either develop or imitate aesthet- ic emotions is responsible for her two seri- ous miscalculations in the novel. The second question involving Undine and Elmer's dif- fering capacities becomes significant in light of their shared origins and otherwise parallel careers, where her march on Fifth Avenue is matched, step by step, by his on Wall Street. I want to suggest that the concept of "aesthetic emotions" held special signifi- cance for Wharton, both in light of Williams James's revolutionary theory of the physical basis of emotions, but more importantly, in light of theories advanced by the art con- noisseurs Bernard Berenson and Vernon Lee, both friends of Wharton and both in turn influenced by James's theory. In their various accounts, aesthetics becomes some- thing experienced through and by the body; art changes humans by touching and modi- fying the body. The new connoisseurship, as it came to be known, became for Wharton an important source for understanding the nature and origins of an individual's capaci- ty for aesthetic response, most notably her own. 1 . A Tactile Disability Let me begin by returning to the scene cited above, one of three or four in the novel that contrast Elmer's affinity for old and beauti- ful objects to Undine's insensibility. What she doesn't understand is why touching these objects touches him in turn, "moving" him and "giving him sensations." Undine is frequently baffled in the novel. Indeed, the novel can be read as series of crass epipha- nies, where every time she's convinced she's reached the top of the social ladder, she real- izes there's a higher rung, with new and often subtler attitudes, codes of conduct, and habits of speech to master. But this momen- tary bewilderment typically gives way to an efficient and uncanny adaptability. Indeed, Ralph Marvel, her second husband, deems her powers in this regard "supernatural" (555). (Continued on page 2)</page><page sequence="2">Edith Wharton Review Spring, 2011 Page 2 (Continued from page 1) Consider her bewildering encounter with a thoroughly unprepossessing, badly dressed woman, who turns out to be a French Princess. Momentarily at a loss when present- ed with "this new social riddle," Undine is quick to recov- er. The new demeanors required for friendship with the Princess "were immediately perceptible" -after all, "she was used to such feats of mental agility" (700, 701). Undine's social education takes two forms: actual- ly assimilating the new codes, as when she remarries her first husband Elmer at the end of the novel, only to realize that his vulgarity "jarred on perceptions that had developed in her unawares" (836), or more often, successfully imitat- ing the codes she cannot or chooses not to internalize. After her engagement to Ralph early in the novel, she needs only ten minutes at the Dagonet table to realize that "to seem very much in love, and a little confused and sub- dued by the newness and intensity of the sentiment was, to the Dagonet mind, the becoming attitude for a young lady in her situation" (506). Given Undine's powers of adapta- tion, especially when her social career is at stake, her inability to assimilate or imitate aesthetic emotions, a fail- ure that jeopardizes her ascent, is an exception that deserves special notice. Perhaps the most dramatic instance of this failure concerns the Dagonet engagement and wedding rings. They are a puzzle for the Spraggs from the start. When the society manicurist Mrs. Heeny notes that they are "old stones" in a "quaint" setting, Undine's mother suspects Ralph has palmed off something used on her daughter, and Mrs. Heeny has to educate them both concerning "ances- tral jewels": "In the European aristocracy they never go out and buy engagement rings; and Undine's marrying into our aristocracy" (502). But the value of this information never sinks in. When Ralph discovers Undine has been consult- ing a jeweler about resetting some of her jewelry, he touch- es the old family ring and smilingly queries, "you won't have that reset?" (558). But of course she does, and it's this-not forgetting her son's birthday party, nor her possi- ble affair with Peter Van Degen, revelations that immedi- ately precede this incident-that we are to believe most fully reveals Undine's callousness: The incident had a meaning out of proportion to its apparent seriousness, for it put in his hand a clue to a new side of his wife's character. . . . [Wjhat pained him was that she had been unconscious of the wound she inflicted in destroying the identity of the jewels. . . . [T]he discovery that she was completely unconscious of states of feeling on which so much of his inner life depended marked a new stage in their relation. (587) What clue are we furnished here? The underlying logic of this passage is that because she does not have this feeling for things, Undine can't understand it in others, and there- fore can't respond accordingly. There are other states of feelings she lacks, but interestingly, this isn't an obstacle to perceiving them in others and using this to her advantage. One only has to think of the use to which the frighteningly unmaternal Undine puts Ralph's feelings for their son. For Wharton, aesthetic emotions represent a special class of feelings that are difficult to perceive, difficult to acquire, and difficult to imitate. Undine's insensibility to old objects furnishes the clue to her character for her third husband as well. Chafing against their lack of liquidity, she suggests Raymond de Chelles sell the "old stuff' in the ancestral home, specifical- ly the Boucher tapestries given the family by Louis Quinze: The suggestion seemed to strike him as something monstrously, almost fiendishly significant: as if her random word had at last thrust into his hand the clue to their whole unhappy difference. Without under- standing this, she guessed it from the change in his face: it was as if a deadly solvent had suddenly decomposed its familiar lines. (793) And the final break comes when he learns she's had the tap- estries appraised. "If you're capable of that you're capable of anything" (807), he concludes. She doesn't understand this relationship to things, and she doesn't learn, as repeating her mistake with Raymond demonstrates. One's tempted to see the missing emotions as part of the satiric evolutionary schema Wharton applies throughout, where Undine emerges as the perfectly adapted social organism. In this light, aesthetic emotions are the emotional equivalent of a little toe; they're not strictly required for the climb. But if her inability to fake these emotions, much less understand them, doesn't ultimately stymie her social career, it certainly diminishes her hold on two of her three husbands, both of whom grow increasingly impervious to her wishes after these show- downs. After her exchange with de Chelles, for example, she feels at a decided disadvantage: "the incident left Undine with the baffled feeling of not being able to count on any of her old weapons of aggression" (794). At bottom, the implication is that this lack of com- prehension originates in the fact that the things she touch- es don't touch her. When Undine tells Raymond what they could get for the tapestries, he responds in a cold fury, "Ah, that's your answer - that's all you feel when you lay hands on things that are sacred to us!" (805). And he's right, she quite literally has no feel for things, a tactile disability analogous to tone deafness. In the world of the novel, it means she's especially at sea in regards to assessing the value of "battered relics," the shorthand used throughout to denote family heirlooms, appreciation of which distin- guishes the perceiver precisely because they don't proclaim (Continued on page 3)</page><page sequence="3">Edith Wharton Review Spring, 2011 Page 3 (Continued from page 2) their value. Their conspicuous imperfections-evidence of age and length of possession-assume special significance when old money with limited resources confronts new money's bottomless pockets. Thus Ralph's cousin Clare gives Ralph's son "a battered old Dagonet bowl that came down to me from our revered great-grandmother" (585), but not before she's done a send up of the alternative, a vulgar gold offering. She recognizes that a gift of this kind would serve as evidence that "I've not enough imagination left to find the right thing, the thing it takes feeling and not money to buy" (585). Importantly, Undine masters this les- son in regards to the human equivalent of battered relics. She knows that "social gold does not always glitter" (700). Hence the Princess Estradina may be a "small, slight and brown" woman, dressed in clothes that we are told look like old water-stained draperies, and still be a social force. So it's really just the objects that require feelings to appre- ciate that Undine stumbles over. Repeatedly. 2. The New Connoisseurship We can trace Wharton's belief about the connection between objects and feelings to a controversial theory of aesthetics that emerged at turn of the century. It drew its inspiration from William James's provocative hypothesis regarding the physical basis of emotion, which challenges our intuitive grasp of emotions as first and foremost men- tal events. James's well-known formulation in Principles of Psychology (1890) turns our conviction regarding the causal order of events on its head. While intuition tells us we cry because we're sad, we hit because we're angry, James argues that "the more rational statement is that we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike" (450). In short, "emotion follows upon the bodily expression" (449). His theory of emotions builds on his account of how objects mobilize and modify the human body, which emerges from James's writings as something exquisitely sensitive, alive, and attuned: "objects do excite bodily changes by a preorganized mechanism [and] the changes The Edith Wharton Society gratefully acknowledges the generous contributions of: Donors: Irene Goldman-Price, Marsha W. Hopper, Marian L. McCue, Gwen M. Neary, Julie Olln-Ammentorp, R. Alan Price, Eva E. Rohrmann, Michael Romain, Sarah Sculco. Webmaster: Donna Campbell Institutional Support: Washington State University Kean University are so indefinitely numerous and subtle that the entire organism may be called a sounding-board, which every change of consciousness, however slight, may make rever- berate" (450). "A purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity" (452), James concludes.1 We see James's influence in the writings of Bernard Berenson, the most famous art connoisseur of his day, who claimed he "owed everything to William James" (qtd. Secrest 188). Berenson, whose close friendship with Wharton began in 1909, is best known for his science of connoisseurship, a method of attribution that used idiosyn- crasies of form to establish the artist of a work.2 But attri- bution can't settle disputes about quality.3 For this, Berenson observes on the last page of "Rudiments of Connoisseurship," we must turn to the art of connoisseur- ship, an altogether different skill that identified master- pieces through their effects on the body. The end of art, for Berenson, is what he calls "life enhancement," and contact with art should promote a sense of well-being. His analysis of a work's capacity to enhance our lives frequently turns on what he describes as its "tactile values" or tactility. For Berenson, the encounter with a masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance reveals an overlap between the boundaries of the senses. If the figure in a work of art successfully con- veys the illusion of tangibility, then "retinal impressions" produce "involuntary muscular sensations inside [the view- er's] palm and fingers corresponding to the various projec- tions of this figure" (Italian 63). The art work colludes with your sense of sight to fool your sense of touch. Thus, one's own body is an important source of evidence for a work's greatness. This shift from the object to the viewer's body, where the work's success is gauged by how it alters and enhances the body, finds its fullest expression in the writ- ings of Wharton's friend Vernon Lee, whose Beauty and Ugliness is surely one of the most astonishing documents in modern aesthetics.4 Her larger project is to outline a sci- ence of aesthetics, where the data are viewers' detailed and uncensored descriptions of what happens to their bodies when looking at specific works of art. The bodies include her own, as recorded in chapter five, "Gallery Diaries," and her collaborator's, Kit Anstruther-Thomson, but also those friends and researchers in the field who have responded to a questionnaire. Lee's argument is an evolutionary one: can we explain why humans gravitate towards certain forms and are repelled by others by their healthful or unhealthful effects on our bodies? For Lee, our connection to things begins with an act of empathy, where we attribute to things the feelings and movements we would have if we were inside them. She's specifically interested in our identifica- tion with forms.5 When we perceive an object, "we are (Continued on page 4)</page><page sequence="4">Edith Wharton Review Spring, 2011 Page 4 (Continued from page 3) attributing to the lines and surfaces, to the spatial forms, those dynamic experiences which we should have were we to put our bodies into similar conditions." In the case of a Doric column, for example, this means attributing to it "a condition akin to our own in keeping erect and defying the force of gravitation" (20-21). What's critical here is that this projection entails the revival of our own past experi- ences - hence her concept of "anthropomorphic aesthet- ics." If the experiences revived through this act of identifi- cation are favorable, we deem the form beautiful; unfavor- able, we deem it ugly (21). Consider what happens to Anstruther-Thomson's body in the act of perceiving a chair: The bilateralness of the object seems to have put both lungs into play; Recognition of the height of the chair ... is accompanied by an upward stretch of the body. This stretch seems suddenly checked by the sight of the heavy clump of ornament on the chair's two top corners. (165). And so on for five pages. Lee uses the term "mimicry" throughout to describe how the body traces form, both internally (through, for example, changes to our breathing) and externally, in its movements (as when the height of the chair induces Kit to stretch). When we call a thing beauti- ful this is a way of saying its alterations to the body bene- fit the organism. As is true of Berenson's theory of tactile values, this very personal form of viewing renders seeing indistin- guishable from touching and thus closes up the distance we typically presume between object and viewer in refined acts of aesthetic appreciation.6 Given these twin develop- ments-an emphasis on the viewer's body as stimulated by what Lee, following James, designated "exciting objects," and seeing merging with touching, it's not at all surprising to find Lee blurring aesthetic and sexual responsiveness. Consider her r-rated response to Titian's Flora, a painting she returns to three times in the course of Gallery Diaries: This picture gives a sense of this flood of life: height- ening one's own (this seems very unaesthetic, per- haps it is). I confess to a wish to kiss - not to touch with fingers - the Flora's throat. The dreadful repainted flesh of the Duchess of Urbino gives me a horrid sense of touching cardboard. (270) Titian's Flora takes me. Her glance, gesture, drap- ery, all drags one in. I have no desire to stroke, touch, or kiss, but there is delight of life, of clean, warm life, such as one wishes for oneself in her flesh. Somehow she is physically attractive - no, if her head were tilted she wouldn't be. (289) I try to go in by pleasure - tactile, thermic - at her flesh and skin, and the vague likeness to a friend I am very fond of. I get to like her-the silky fur (Continued on page 5) Edith Wharton Collection Research Award Deadline: March 15, 2012 Each year the Edith Wharton Society offers an Edith Wharton Collection Research Award of $1 ,500 to enable a scholar to conduct research on the Edith Wharton Collection of materials at the Beinecke Library at Yale University.

(309) We can trace the erotic charge in the above passages to Flora's body, but also Lee's body, as it registers and explores Flora's. In a striking passage, Lee argues that we can account for the differences between our aesthetic pow- ers by differences in our familiarity with our own bodies: "The localization of sensations of muscular strain, etc., depends partly upon a visualization of one's own body which many people scarcely possess, partly upon some schematic sense of the relation of various sensitive tracts of the body . . . which in most of us is extremely imperfect" (135). It's hard to imagine a greater challenge to the turn- of-the century fine arts establishment than this hypothesis that appreciating art can't be separated from knowledge of one's own body, especially its sensitive tracts. Various mischievous remarks by Berenson indicate that he too saw the new connoisseurship as a theory where the aesthetic and the erotic meet. He enjoyed quoting a friend who had asked him if the theory of tactile values "could be discussed with young girls" (qtd. in Secrest 187). He's also reported to have said that "A work of art is like women; il faut coucher avec [one has to sleep with it]" (qtd in Secrest 1 88). 3. Love Object: The Case of the Beautiful Fake Together with Berenson's extensive writings, Beauty and Ugliness reveals a corporeal turn in aesthetics, at the cen- ter of which is a stimulated body, one "lit up" by beautiful objects. Through Undine, Wharton registers a complex awareness of this blurring of aesthetic and sexual respon- siveness. I noted above that Undine's one deficiency is her lack of feeling for beautiful objects, but that's not entirely accurate: she also lacks sexual desire. They've only been on their honeymoon a few weeks when Ralph notes, "She had never shown any repugnance to his tenderness, but such a response as it evoked was remote and Ariel-like, suggesting from the first, not so much of the recoil of igno- rance as the coolness of the element from which she took her name" (545). At a critical moment in her attempt to separate Peter Van Degen from his wife, he tries to kiss her and she recoils: "her physical reactions were never very acute: she always wondered why people made 'such a fùss,' were so violently for or against such demonstrations" (640). Wharton argues through Undine's twin deficiencies that aesthetic and sexual responsiveness depend equally on the strength of one's physical reactions. More specifically, they share the same motor system, with both depending on the tactile, on one's capacity for touch and being touched in turn. Lacking the natural and spontaneous physical responses, Undine is left to mimic both sexual and aesthet- ic pleasure. We see this in what is perhaps her most pecu- liar trait, her incessant body movements. Early in the novel Wharton describes her as "twisting this way and that, fan- ning, fidgeting, twitching at her draperies" (459-60). Later we are told that this "flashing and fidgeting" "were the only way she knew of taking part in the immemorial love- dance" (491). Similarly, she will try to imitate aesthetic absorption. In one of the funniest scenes in the novel, Undine visits an art gallery. Indifferent to the art, she nonetheless recognizes that being seen looking at art can advance her social agenda. She "flung herself into rapt attitudes before the canvases, scribbling notes in the cata- logue in imitation of a tall girl in sables, while ripples of self-consciousness played up and down her watchful back" (477). The raptness Undine pretends to here, as with Elmer's genuine engrossment, suggests how the new con- noisseurship bestowed value on specific bodily responses, forms, and activities. If looking at art changes the body, then the viewer's body becomes subject to scrutiny. The idea that we can distinguish both the quality of things and the quality of viewers by the body's response is one that gains currency during this period. Ronald Spencer, editor of The Expert Versus the Object: Judging Fakes and False Attributions in the Visual Arts, recounts how Whistler dismissed an alleged Velazquez at a glance, declaring, "I always swoon when I see a Velazquez" (xv). Berenson, whose writings would make him one of the most powerful and influential authorities in the art trade, frequently cited his initial physical symptoms as his most infallible guide. When he was asked during the infamous Hahn trial for evi- dence that the painting in question was a fake, Berenson recalls that when he examined it, "his stomach felt wrong. He had a curious ringing in his ears. He was struck by a momentary depression. Or he felt woozy and off balance" (qtd in Hoving 19-20).7 In these cases the connoisseur's physical reactions are treated as evidence not simply of an object's beauty but of its authenticity. And it's the role that the body comes to play during this period in the myriad dis- putes about authenticity and attribution that exposes a problem with the new connoisseurship, one that Wharton dramatizes in her novel.* This problem can be traced in part to the perceived kinship between sexual and aesthetic response, and the body's potential for misleading the (art) lover. Can't we fall in love with or be seduced by a beautiful fake? Berenson was famously reluctant to concede his mistakes in attribu- tion, but when he did, he ascribed these to the emotional overlay of the encounter with the object. His biographer Meryl Secrest describes one of his most sensational mis- takes, which involved using a fake Gioigione for the fron- tispiece of his book The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance. The art historian Kenneth Clark recalls (Continued on page 6)</page><page sequence="6">Edith Wharton Review Spring, 201 1 Page 6 (Continued from page 5) standing silently before this same painting years later with Berenson and his wife Mary, who was also his partner. Mary finally observes, "B, we must have been in love," and he nods in agreement (qtd in Secrest 127). This is an unac- knowledged tension in some contemporary accounts of art fraud as well. In his introduction to False Impressions: The Hunt for Big-Time Art Fakes, Thomas Hoving describes "falling in love" with objects and viewing them as "dear friends whom I adore and have to visit as frequently as pos- sible." Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, goes on to explain that this is why he's such a zealous fake buster: "it's vital to me that they are what they are supposed to be. It's a matter of human trust" (17). While the anecdotes he recounts are intended to showcase his gift for immediately discerning an object's authenticity, passages like this suggest that the very inten- sity of the experience an object affords the viewer can pre- cede and muddy judgments regarding authenticity. The intimacy enshrined by the new connoisseurship as the ideal aesthetic mode (il fait coucher avec) invariably raises ques- tions about judgments that wear the mark of their subjec- tive origin. It's this liability that Wharton explores through Ralph's "fatal attraction" for Undine. He imagines that her physical beauty and her sensitivity to social nuances bespeak corresponding depths of thought and feeling. Even as he dis- covers the extent of his mistake, he continues to feel subject to what he describes as the "penetrating physical sensation" (646) triggered by his memories of her. One of his last thoughts before he kills himself involves being at the mercy of her phys- ical presence: "There came to him, for the first time in months, that overwhelming sense of her physical nearness which had once so haunted and tortured him" (758). Through the language of connoisseurship, Wharton suggests that she's less interested in the nature of romantic infatuation than in depicting the susceptibilities of an extreme version of the connoisseur's sensibility. When Ralph's fury with Undine over the resetting of the family ring briefly frees him from his feelings for her, the analogy is that of someone finally being able to look at a painting with detachment: "His eye received the picture with dis- tinctness; but for the first time it did not pass into his veins. It was as if he had been struck with a subtle blindness that permitted images to give their colour to the eye but com- municated nothing to the brain" (593). Paradoxically, only a form of blindness allows him to see her clearly, specifi- cally a form of blindness that disconnects the eyes from the brain and thus from the rest of the body. It's appropriate then that Ralph's illness takes the form of "intensified physical perceptions." He feels "as though he were some vivisected animal deprived of the power of discrimination" (757). Here it's not Undine's beauty but Elmer's ugliness that overwhelms him. In this scene, Elmer's body is surreally magnified. Despite the fact that they're separated by a desk, Ralph can see "the growth of short black hair on his manicured hands, even the tiny crack and crows'-feet beginning to show in the hard close surface of his complexion: all these solid wit- nesses to his reality and proximity pressed on Ralph with the mounting pang of physical nausea" (756).

To carry through with the connoisseurship analogy, in what sense does Ralph's powerful response to Undine's beauty lead him to mistake her for the real thing? Certainly she's not the "frank and simple" naïf he'd initially thought. Nor does she turn out to have the desire or capacity to be taught by him to respond to the finer sensations, as Ralph at one point fatuously imagines. But the more important sense in which Undine is a "fake" is connected to Wharton's view of the nouveaux riche as having adopted many of the outward forms of the established upper class- es with little feel for or interest in their character, values, or traditions. At one point Ralph compares the nouveaux riche to a house whose walls are built by Wall Street money, with a façade supplied by 5th Avenue. He characterizes this "union" as "monstrous and factitious, as unlike the gradual homogenous growth which flowers into what other coun- tries know as society, as that between the Blois gargoyles on Peter Van Degen 's roof and the skeleton walls support- ing them" (493). This same note is struck by Charles Bowen, the novel's proto-anthropologist, as he studies a group gathering for dinner at a Paris restaurant. "Watching the picture compose itself again before his eyes," he describes it as "a phantom 'society,' with all the rules, smirks, gestures of its model, but evoked out of promiscu- ity and incoherence while the other had been the product of continuity and choice" (627). "Nothing that ever happens here is real," he concludes (627). Through Ralph, Bowen and especially Raymond de Chelles, Wharton offers her own critique of Old Money as hidebound and fastidious- ness, but there's no doubt that in her mind there was some- thing disturbingly "unreal" about a society that seemingly appeared overnight and whose striking but superficial resemblance to real society is as misleading and incongru- ous as Renaissance ornaments hung on a brand new build- ing. In Ralph's mistake we see evidence of the ambigu- ity surrounding the sensitive body's "aesthetic emotions" and their ability to distinguish an object's authenticity, as potentially distinct from its beauty. These visceral emo- tions are both evidence of the "eye," a natural gift that training enhances but that no amount of training can replace, and an unreflective response that leaves the con- noisseur open to seduction by "love objects," Hoving's apt phrase for beautiful fakes (Hoving 297). 4. An Aristocracy of the Finer Senses This brings us to Elmer, who unexpectedly possesses both the gift of the eye and, unlike Ralph, the collector's detach- ment-unexpectedly because Wharton establishes Elmer as Undine's male counterpart. If anything, he's cruder, with little of her facility for picking up on and adapting to sub- tleties of tone, dress, or manners. He's loud and red at the beginning of the novel and loud and red at the end. And yet he has this innate feel for things. Wharton repeatedly draws attention to Elmer's communions with objects, including the scene I summarized at the opening of the essay. Another telling scene between the two takes place in Undine's hotel room at a critical moment in her marriage negotiations with de Chelles: On the way [to the window] he stopped before a table covered with showy trifles, and after looking at them for a moment singled out a dim old brown and golden book which Chelles had given her. He examined it lin- geringly, as though it touched the spring of some choked-up sensibility for which he had not language. (720) Elmer moves instinctively and unerringly towards the only authentic object in the room- the only thing that, like the bat- tered Dagonet bowl, doesn't announce its value-and that as Clare observes about the bowl, it thus takes feeling rather than money to appreciate. These are undoubtedly the same "old brown books" that Raymond will try to share with Undine after they marry until he realizes "her inability to fix her attention" (779). Both Elmer's caressing touch and his muteness testify to the depth of his response. This is true despite the fact that Wharton leaves us in no doubt that, like Undine, Elmer lacks the capacity to appreciate the contents of the book. Something interesting happens at this point in the scene. Still lost in the beauty of the book, Elmer begins to speak. "Say - ," he muses, which Undine recognizes as "the usual prelude to his enthusiasm," but then he stops, puts the book down, and picks up the thread of their con- versation. The book forgotten, he proceeds to dispassion- ately outline a chilling plan for obtaining the money for her annulment by threatening to take their young son from Ralph. As Wharton will demonstrate again and again in Elmer's relation to things, he's both genuinely moved by them and, unlike Ralph, capable of bracketing these sensa- tions. As Undine concludes when she wonders at his abili- ty to join a noisy lunch party moments after she witnesses him quietly communing with some relics, "his aesthetic emotions had been thrust back into their own compart- ment" (818). This detachment doesn't just allow him to conduct his Wall Street business, it also helps him to iden- tify, appraise and acquire these objects, and by the end of the novel he's become what one dealer describes as the greatest American collector (795). With the allusion to collectors we feel we're back to the familiar story of crass, moneyed Americans (Continued on page 8)</page><page sequence="8">Edith Wharton Review Spring, 201 1 Page 8 (Continued from page 7) plundering the halls of British aristocracy for objects with the pedigree and the patina of age they themselves lack. Thus it's easy to miss how Wharton complicates this pic- ture. When Elmer describes to Undine his "growing pas- sion for pictures and furniture," she sees his expression change: "his eyes gr[e]w younger, almost boyish. ... 'I mean to have the best, you know; not just to get ahead of the other fellows, but because I know it when I see it. I guess that's the only good reason' " (800-01). Elmer has the con- noisseur's infallible instinct for authenticity and the involun- tary, reflexive response that testifies to his authenticity. This returns us to my second question: what signif- icance does Wharton attach to Elmer's aesthetic disposi- tion? Certainly endowing him with the capacity for aesthet- ic emotions has the effect of highlighting the mysterious- ness of it all. Here's someone with no education, no dis- cernible taste in other matters, no language to describe what he's feeling ("ain't she a peach?" he observes to Ralph about a crystal vase), who nonetheless reveals an instinctive eye and feel for the most refined pleasures: "a vase of Phoenician glass that was like a bit of rainbow caught in cobwebs"; the crystal vase with a design "as frail as the shadow of grass-blades on water" incised on its "dewy sides" (751); "a little Greek marble" with "pure" "simple" lines (821). And it only adds to the seeming arbi- trariness of possession of this sensibility that his female "twin," who surpasses Elmer in her grasp of most other subtleties, has no feel for these things. Wharton's conviction as to the arbitrariness of this gift reveals an unlikely connection between the writer and one of her most vulgar creations. More importantly, it allows us to grasp the framework within which she made sense of her own sensitive body. In the chapters devoted to her child- hood in A Backward Glance and "Life and I," Wharton dis- cusses her early and acutely visceral response to the aesthet- ic properties of things and people. She maintains that even as a young child she "suffered] from ugliness," ("Life" 1072) and the sight of beautiful objects leaves her "trembl[ing] with a sensuous ecstasy" ("Life" 1091). She doesn't simply dis- cern an object's aesthetic properties, she experiences them, through a body that instinctively, and in the case of ugliness, painfully, resonates to these properties. What's especially striking about Wharton's accounts of her childhood is that despite all of the privileges she enjoyed by virtue of birth into the Jones family, she depicts her own sensibility as almost as unlikely a possession as it was for Elmer, or, for that matter, Berenson, born in a Lithuanian shtetl .' In her autobiographical writings, she emphasizes those dispositions that even as a child set her apart from her family. The distance she tacitly marks off between herself and various old New York circles is measured by their distance from artists and intellectuals. "No one in our set had any intellectual interests," she states flatly, beginning with her parents, "who were far from intellectual, who read little and studied not at all" ( Backward 852). She was "never taken to a concert, or any kind of musical performance," and although her parents enjoyed traveling abroad, they "did not profit much by the artistic and intellectual advantages of European travel" (Backward 828, 831). The world Wharton evokes is "an intellectual desert," a place where the "arts are nonexistent," and where her own aspirations are met by "a thick fog of indifference, if not tacit disapproval" ("Life and I" 1089; Backward 122). In methodically distancing herself from old New York, Wharton orphans herself, preparing the reader for the dramatic moment of self-presentation in A Backward Glance when she envisions herself as a "homeless waif," who is then free to acquire a new "nationality." "The Land of Letters was henceforth to be my country," she vows, "and I gloried in my new citizenship" (Backward 873). This powerful evocation of a country beyond belies the vulnerability of the waif. And while it strains our credulity to imagine that Wharton would have claimed Elmer as a fellow citizen in any country, the unexpectedness of Elmer's aesthetic powers is a reflection of Wharton's conception of her own sensibility as a gift of nature, rather than a byproduct of membership in her class.10 We can trace this concept of the aesthetic body to the new connoisseurship, which may have initially treated aes- thetic response as a feature of human embodiment, but devel- oped into a discourse about certain bodies born for certain experiences. In The Custom of the Country , through Undine and Ralph, Wharton dramatizes the liabilities of both the insensible and the aesthetic body. In Elmer, she takes her understanding of the origins of her own sensibility to its log- ical conclusion- with the surprising result that she endows one a rich philistine with an unerring and instinctive feel for the most refined pleasures. For Wharton, aesthetic emotions represent a special class of emotions that could appear in someone largely devoid of other refinements-and regardless of their class background. This assertion would seem risible in a novel like The Custom of the Country, where the protag- onist's ascent is predicated on a social ladder whose rungs are differentiated in large part by subtle and not so subtle differ- ences in taste. But the mystery of the origin of Elmer Moffatt's aesthetic emotions reveals Wharton flirting with the notion of an aristocracy of the finer senses, a natural aristoc- racy that would admit a connection between an Invader and a daughter of old New York. Notes 1 Although James distinguishes in his work between "coars- er" and "subtler" emotions, he engages head-on the poten- tially unwelcome and threatening upshot of his hypothesis: "rapture, love, ambition, indignation, and pride, considered (Continued on page 9)</page><page sequence="9">Edith Wharton Review Spring, 2011 Page 9 (Continued from page 8) as feelings, are fruits of the same soil with the grossest bodily sensations of pleasure and of pain" (467). Critics are still disputing the correct exegesis of James's writings on the emotions, but the notion of all emotions as fundamentally physiological phenomena quickly escaped James's efforts at definitional limitation. See Ellsworth, and Reisenzein et al's response to Ellsworth, for two recent attempts to clarify James's theory in regards to the link between emotion and the body. Shusterman addresses the specific case of the link between the body and aesthetic emotions. 2 Wharton and Berenson first crossed paths in 1903, but their friendship dates from 1909. See Lee's account of their close and occasionally prickly relationship relationship, including Lee's speculation that Wharton did not know about Berenson's unsavory collusion with the powerful art dealer Joseph Duveen (404-21). See Secrest for a detailed account of how Berenson's scholarly attributions were com- promised by his consulting work for Duveen. Secrest men- tions in passing that Berenson once used Wharton to gener- ate interest in a dodgy painting in which he had a stake (256). 3 Even as Berenson directed attention to the experience produced by objects, he was perhaps best known for a sci- entific approach to attribution that narrowly focused on the properties of the object. Berenson's approach built on the work of the Italian art historian Giovanni Morelli. A physi- cian by training, Morelli maintained that the identity of an artist was to be found in a painting's minor details, where artists reverted to a characteristic style in the execution of these details. For the same reasons, these seemingly subor- dinate features were more likely to betray the imitator, forg- er or copyist. Berenson, who met Morelli in 1890, decided that same year to dedicate his life to establishing the correct attributions for Italian Renaissance painting. See Gibson- Wood for a full account of "the Morellian method" (205-37) as well as Morelli's influence on Berenson (238-47). Wharton tried her own hand at attribution, the results of which she published as "A Tuscan Find" in Scribner's in 1895. 4 Vernon Lee was the pseudonym of the British writer Violet Paget. In A Backward Glance, Wharton describes Lee as "the first highly cultivated and brilliant woman I had ever known" (884-86) 5 Lee frames her theory of forms as an extension of James's theory of the emotions. Just as James argued certain bodily sensations make up what we call sadness, "so can the sub- jective states indicated by the objective terms height, breadth, depth, by the more complex terms round, square, symmetrical, unsymmetrical, and all their kindred terms, be analysed into more or less distinct knowledge of various and variously localized bodily movements" (1587-58). 6 Secrest describes the falling out between Berenson and Lee over Berenson's accusations that Lee and Anstruther- Thomson had plagiarized his ideas (195-96).

When Harry and Andre Hahn claimed a painting they were selling was by Leonardo da Vinci, Duveen declared it a copy, making it virtually impossible for the Hahns to sell the painting. The Hahns sued Duveen for libel. The trial, which dragged on for more than six years and brought in all the leading art authorities, including Berenson, become a trial about the various theories of connoisseurship. Duveen eventually settled with the Hahns out of court. See Adams for a detailed account of the trial. 8 The Gilded Age art market was dominated by newly rich Americans interested in acquiring European master- pieces, many of which were owned by impoverished European aristocrats. This is the first time that art trans- actions required a go-between, and thus the art dealer was born. Independent scholars like Berenson were brought in to verify - or challenge-what up till then had been accepted on the basis of family lore. 9 Wharton's anti-Semitism had been well-documented, but she appears to have turned a blind eye to Berenson's Jewishness. Lee speculates that Berenson was "the exceptional Jew" in her life, just as she was the "excep- tional woman-as-equal" in his (411). Berenson, who con- verted first to the Episcopal and then the Catholic church, lived with the constant anxiety of betraying his Jewishness: According to Secrest, "They [Walter and Mary] could never relax. One spontaneous syllable, a sin- gle unguarded reference, a revelatory gesture, and the façade would collapse" (166-67). 10 As I have argued elsewhere, Wharton's understanding of the nature and origins of her own gifts is a singularly vivid case of what Bourdieu calls "misrecognition." She is recognizing real differences, but she is misattributing their source. One of Bourdieu's most important insights into the operations of class is that the gifts of the happy few are in fact the product of privileged conditions of existence. "A 'gift,' he argues, "is nothing other than the feel for the game socially constituted by early immersion in the game, that class racism turns into a nature" (In Other Words 109). The so-called gifts of nature are easy to misrecognize because they're learned at such an early age that they have all the hallmarks of an innate reflex. Read in this light, Wharton's autobiographies become a case study in how the aesthetic disposition is made, not born, through childhood encounters with expensive fab- rics, food, books, through travel, and through exposure to the fine arts.
