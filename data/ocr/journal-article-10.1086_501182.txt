      <p>As Dorothy Verkerk notes in this monograph, much of the older scholarship on the intriguing yet enigmatic illustrations of the Ashburnham Pentateuch stressed the reconstruction of pictorial models. For many early medieval art historians, the Pentateuch was a “provincial” work, though the place of origin was debated. Its eighteen pages of imagery were fundamentally unoriginal, probably copied from lost Jewish sources, possibly antique Jewish codices containing narrative picture cycles.</p>
      <p>Verkerk’s study of the Pentateuch miniatures as creative responses to contemporary, late sixth‐ or early seventh‐century religious and cultural conditions is a refreshing departure from older approaches. The material presented includes varied late antique Mediterranean, Christian works of art and literature. Her treatment of the artistic material is the most convincing. Although the subjects of the Pentateuch illustrations are Old Testament, she demonstrates that the artist encouraged a typological reading by incorporating allusions to Christian doctrine and liturgy. Verkerk’s interpretation of some of these details is debatable. Noah’s altar (fig. 19), for example, is set not with a chalice and bread (113, 193) but with three chalices or basins of blood (see 82); the eucharistic significance is ambiguous. While the opening in the tabernacle altars (figs. 10, 21) may be for Christian relics, the best parallel is the opening in the tabernacle altar of holocausts depicted in the lost sixth‐century <italic>Codex Grandior</italic> from Cassiodorus’s Vivarium. Bede, who describes the <italic>Grandior</italic> image, thought the cavity was for the altar’s fuel (<italic>De tabernaculo</italic> 2, Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina, 119A:81–82). Verkerk’s main point, though, is sound: the Christian iconographic references and the selection of scenes in the Pentateuch show the influence of contemporary Christian theology and literature.</p>
      <p>Basing her conclusion on paleographic and artistic evidence, Verkerk suggests that the Pentateuch may have been commissioned by deacons in Italy, possibly Rome, to assist in training new deacons; the literary comparisons offered, however, it should be noted, are all writings from bishops (189–90). The arguments for an Italian origin are compelling. As for Rome being the center, Verkerk nicely discusses the documentary evidence that manuscripts flowed into and out of the city in the sixth and seventh centuries, and there were doubtless workshops producing codices. But that the Pentateuch was one of them is less certain. Verkerk’s argument that the illustrations showing the Exodus pillar of cloud and fire as a paschal candle reflect the Roman liturgy is unpersuasive. While the candle is an attested feature of Easter vigils in northern Italy from the fourth century, it was not part of the papal mass until the tenth (161). Moreover, although surviving Roman productions in other media offer iconographic parallels to a few Pentateuch miniatures, as she notes, pilgrims carried knowledge of the city’s art and customs to other regions. This could well explain the possible allusion, in one illustration, to Rome’s seven deacons (see 159).</p>
      <p>Stronger claims can perhaps be made for the manuscript’s origin in northern Italy. One clue (in addition to the candle imagery) may be the Creation miniature. Two anthropomorphic creators were originally represented side by side in four separate scenes (one creator in each was later erased), and one scene also included the Holy Spirit, probably as a dove (later erased). Verkerk plausibly suggests that the miniature was informed by the Three Chapters controversy (66–70), a christological quarrel that erupted when Emperor Justinian called for revisions to the decisions of Chalcedon. Rome acquiesced, causing a schism with other Latin sees, among them Aquileia in northern Italy; the Aquilean schism lasted into the seventh century. Yet Verkerk links the miniature with the position defended in Rome, which emphasized the unity of Father and Son through Christ’s divinity. The Pentateuch picture, however, portraying Father and Son as separate “persons,” seems more probably intended to stress their distinct personhood, a doctrine that corresponds better to the schismatic position. Other evidence might also link the Pentateuch with northern Italy, such as the identification of its Vulgate text with the Cassidoran family (48–49). As Samuel Barnish observed, a significant number of manuscripts seem to have gone from Cassiodorus’s Vivarium to a northern Italian center (“The Work of Cassiodorus after His Conversion,” <italic>Latomus: Revue d’Études Latines</italic> 48 [1989]: 157–87). There are also features connecting the Pentateuch with the <italic>Codex Amiatinus</italic>, a Northumbrian pandect influenced by Cassiodorus’s <italic>Codex Grandior</italic> and perhaps indirectly indicative of northern Italian traditions.</p>
      <p>Finally, two criticisms of Cambridge University Press. One is the poor quality of the reproductions and the lack of any in color, though some of Verkerk’s most interesting discussions hinge on this. Second, more careful editing might have caught various errors of grammar and syntax, as well as factual errors and inconsistencies.</p>
      <p>Despite these concerns, though, Verkerk has made a significant contribution to early medieval biblical and art historical scholarship. This is a thoughtful, readable analysis, grounded in recent methodologies, of a fascinating codex.</p>
