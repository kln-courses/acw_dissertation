In suggesting the scope of work, Dr. Thapar says that there is considerable field for investi gation in the morphology of the worms, as hel minth fauna of India still remains unexplored. Even the re-investigation of the described forms seems to offer ample scope of work, as errors in diagnosis are perpetuated in the recent literature on the subject. Illustrations are given from the work of various authors to show the justification of re-investigation of even the described forms. The chief problem in helminth morphology to day is the elimination of errors which unfortu nately have crept into the earlier literature. The accurate morphology and natural classi fication would answer the problems of relation ship and evolution of the group and numerous illustrations cited have been collected from the work of Dr. Thapar and his colleagues at Lucknow. The solution of life histories will greatly facili tate the control measures and Leiper's work on the Schistomiasis in Egypt amply justifies fur ther work on similar lines. The recent discovery of Echinococcus cysts at Lucknow simulating cœnurus cysts seems interesting and promises fresh fields for experimental investigations.

The discovery of Schistosoma spindalis as a cause of "Nasal granuloma" of cattle, commonly known as snoring disease in India and the recent investigations on the etio logy of "Barsati" of equines, showing Habro nema larvae in the affected parts of the animal's body are illustrations to indicate worms as cause of disease in animals. Both these animal diseases were believed to be of mycotic origin and these discoveries mark a new era in the disease investigation of animals in India.

Thapar, in Iiis Presidential Address on the "needs and opportunities of Helminthologi cal Research in India" emphasizes the impor tance of helminthology in medicine, public health, veterinary science and agriculture. He pointed out the indifference with which this science was studied in India, but in recent years there would seem to he a growing appreciation, both by the Government and the Universities, of its impor tance. The recognition of the work of profes sional zoologists in India in this connection seems to be a healthy sign, as the past records in other countries reveal the solution of many fundamental problems of helminthology at the hands of the zoologists. It is true that refinements in sanitation are helpful in the eradication of human parasites : in fact "Tania solium is said to have taken a road to extinction when the mythical Chinaman burned down his house, ate the incinerated pig and pronounced that it was good." But there are great many difficulties in the control of hel minths of domestic animals. Limited sanita tion, over-population of farm animals, due to greater utilisation of land for agriculture and human habitation, varied means of transport ation and climatic factors—all help to increase helminthic infection of the domestic animals. It is, therefore, necessary that investigations should be undertaken on an extensive scale on such problems in an agricultural country like India. Referring to the ancient history of the subject in India, Dr. Thapar drew attention to the refer ences found in Sûsruta, Charaka and Madhava Nidhana and from these he has identified such i worms as Dvimukha and Parisarpa as Enterobius * vermicularis' and Microfilariae respectively under ' the modern scheme of nomenclature. But very little progress seems to have been made on the subject in ancient India and the doctrine of Ahimsa seems to have played its part in this direction. Much of the recent information on worms in India is due, chiefly, to the valuable work of certain enthusiastic officers of medical and vete rinary services, who, in the course of their routine work, were confronted with worms and this formed the basis of our knowledge of the subject. Unfortunately, there are great difficulties in providing adequate knowledge of helminthology for our students in India, though the Text-Books in Zoology claim to have been revised and brought upt.odate, they still contain old and antiquated nomenclature and classification and these instances are enumerated. Some of these text-books give a confused account of the life histories of even the common worms, like Asca ris. This leads to a serious handicap in the treatment and application of preventive measures.

The experience of such a work in other countries amply justifies such a line of action in India.
