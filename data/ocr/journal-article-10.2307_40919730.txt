<plain_text><page sequence="1">Insider and Outsider: An Inari Saami Case Thomas A. DuBois University of Washington rr Nils Gaup's seminal film Ofelas (Pathfinder 1989), Nils- Aslak Valkeapää's Beaivi, Áh câzan (The Sun My Father 1989) , or the infamous Alta-Kautokeino dam conflict (IWGIA 1981), contemporary Saami socio-political and cultural activism revolves around issues of land and its use. The safeguarding of Saami modes of land and resource exploitation has been accomplished through the invocation of indigenous people's rights and the claim that Saami people maintain a unique relation with the terrain and its essence (Rantala 1982). Similar assertions have been made regarding indigenous peoples in Canada (Brody 1975, Brody 1982) and, in the Nordic regions, the Faroese (Wylie and Margolin 1981). The question remains, however, as to how and to what extent Saami notions of land have altered over the last several centuries. How did, for example, nineteenth-century Saami conceptualize place and land and to what extent did this conceptualization play a role in personal and communal identity? How did various Saami groups view the Russians, Finns, Scandinavians, and other Saami who lived beside or among them and who used the land in different ways? In this essay, I propose to explore this complex of issues by examining place as a narrative category in stories collect by the linguist A. V. Koskimies during his time among the Inari Saami ( 1 880s). These stories demonstrate the persistence of ancient dichotomies be- tween inside and outside expressed through differential associations A draft of this paper was presented at the 91st Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association 2-6 December 1992. Further research on the topic was facilitated by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The symbolic system maintained its currency among nineteenth- century Inari Saami despite the fact that the siida system itself and Inari culture in general had undergone tremendous changes by the time of Koskimies arrival. Before proceeding to the narratives collected by Koskimies, we need to review some aspects of Inari culture and its historical transforma- tion. The great lake Inari of northern Finland, not far from the Arctic Ocean (and called in Saami Anar)^ has long supported a culture dis- tinct from that of other Saami communities. During the last half of the nineteenth century, this distinctiveness was based on at least four key factors: 1 . A distinctive dialect, the study of which led Koskimies to collect and transcribe the stories which form the basis of the present study; 2. A distinctive life style based on fishing and farming; 3 . A breakdown of the siida organization and a compensatory reliance on Finnish juridical and social organizations; 4. A strong acceptance of Luthcranism and related cultural phenom- ena, for example literacy (Nickul 1977). The other Saami communities to the east and west displayed differing degrees of adaptation to non-Saami culture: the forest Saami of the Suenjel siida, for example, retained traditional modes of land use and migration into the twentieth century, while many other coastal, forest, and mountain groups underwent various cultural transformations in response to colonization, border regulations, resource depletion, and relocation. The complexity of these historical factors are such that no easy characterization of Saami cultural change can be offered: rather, we must examine cultural change on a region- by-region basis (Nickul 1977, Fjellström 1985). From a linguistic or life-mode perspective, the notion of a single nineteenth-century Saami people hardly seems adequate, although a strong case can be made for contemporary Saami ethnicity (Aikio and Aikio 1986). EugeenRoosens's( 1989) discussion of ethnogenesis within political contexts is useful in understanding how the long-standing and divisive differences between various Saami communities have been over- come during the current pan-Saami cultural revival. The finding of common ground among Saami has important socio-political goals: pan-Saami cultural identity offers an effective means of asserting local rights and of reversing the tradition of political disenfranchisement and cultural devaluation familiar to colonized indigenous peoples in general.</page><page sequence="3">An Inari Saami Case 65 In late nineteenth-century Finland, however, the pan-Saami revival had not yet begun, and Anar Saami - predominantly Lutheran in faith, sometimes evangelically so - literate, fishing-oriented, and sedentary felt quite apart from their nomadic or semi-nomadic neighbors who adhered to other forms of Christianity (e.g. the Russian Orthodox Church) and occasionally retained aspects of pre-Christian belief and practice. One of Koskimies's informants, the catechist Heikki Mattus, provides a telling account of local Anar Lutheran religiosity during the first half of the nineteenth century. Mut ehidist ajn kuo nabdem parramaz lejmpurram, tee eänndmrokke ajn lüuvatij mujan pãrnáâid ehidasrukosijd jà Isämeid ja Heard sivnddaz. Tee koolßajm vala juaha¿ salbukeiÖaj celkkiÖ: aJeesus sivndà oaÔÔiÔ.» (Koskimies 1978: 370) [But in the evening once we had eaten our meal, my late mother always used to read to us children the evening prayers and Lord's Prayer and the doxology. With our hands folded, we had to say after every word: "Jesus bless our bed time."] Clearly, Anar Saami practiced an orthodox and pious form of Lutheranism and were careful to raise their children within the faith. The nineteenth century also saw the replacement of Anar migration with a progressively more sedentary agricultural lifestyle. The intro- duction of potato farming in 1828 tied Anar family units to discreet blocks of land and hindered migration even within the lake district. During his years as vicar of Inari (1819-1831), Jacob Fellner notes that surplus male labor was dispatched to the shores of the Arctic Ocean to fish during the summer and their earnings were used to purchase such goods as flour and tobacco upon their return at the end of August. The abundance of fishing within the Anar region itself made a more seden- tary lifestyle possible, and reindeer herding was practiced only locally with no organized migrations (Nickul 1977). This specialization in fishing and localized reindeer husbandry was paralleled by a breakdown of the sii Act system. The traditional siiday a collective consisting of a group of families and their shared land, appears to have functioned in the past as both an institution for the conservation of resources and a means of ensuring support in times of famine or hardship (Vilkuna 1971, Fjellström 1985). Annual commu- nal deer hunts - traditionally a key source of winter sustenance for impoverished families - were only the subject of oral history by the</page><page sequence="4">66 Scandinavian Studies 1880s (Koskimies 1978: 378-83), and the last meeting of an Anar siida for the exercise of its juridical function occurred during the 1 860s (Halonen 1969, Nickul 1977). The triumphs of Anar Lutheranism and the assimilation of a seden- tary, agricultural lifestyle separated the Anar people from their fellow Saami neighbors to the east and west. As Fellner writes: "The Inari inhabitant, who is able to read, lives to a great extent among other Lapps, without, however, adopting their customs" (cited in Nickul 1977: 16). At the same time, however, persistent linguistic and cultural differences, as well as marked anti-Saami prejudice, separated the Anar from the mainstream culture of northern Finland. And this sense of marginality, of being between Saami and Finnish norms, becomes apparent in the narrative centrality of the Anar region in the material Koskimies collected.1 A word on the texts used in this study: during 1886, A.V. Koskimies set out to collect samples of the dialect spoken in the Lake Inari region. The anthology of joiks^ folk narratives, and personal accounts which resulted was published by the Finno-Ugric Society (Koskimies 1917) using an elaborate orthography designed to represent the intricacies of Inari speech along with a relatively literal Finnish translation by T.I. Itkonen. In 1979, the texts were reissued by the Society with a mod- ernized orthography specifically for the use of folklorists undertaking historical-geographic studies of the recorded material (Koskimies 1978 ) . To my knowledge, however, no attempts have been made to analyze these narratives from a stylistic or thematic perspective. And although the reissued collection arranges the narratives according to the Aarne- Thompson (AT 1961) and Christiansen (ML 1958) catalogues, thus facilitating comparison with other published collections of Saami folk- tales (e.g. Qvigstad and Sandberg 1887), no attention is paid to those aspects which render the narratives recognizable as Saami creations. A good example of this problem is evident in Iisakki Mannermaa's telling of a legend much like ML 8005, the legend of a soldier return- ing home just in time to prevent his wife from remarrying ( 148-57). In Mannermaa's version, the drafted soldier is rendered a merchant instead: Tovle Uj oht riges käypp-almaj, kote käypistis rißoj jà, vyeljjiskuoÒij oljjoœœnnaman káálvu vie¿¿aO. . . . (Koskimies 1978: 149) 1 Paine's (1994) account of Norwegian Costal Saami during the 1950s provides a valuable comparison.</page><page sequence="5">An Inari Saami Case 67 [There once was a rich merchant, who grew wealthy from his trade and determined to bring in more goods from abroad.] The term used for abroad, here olog&amp;ana, (contemporary Northern Saami olßoeana), denotes all lands outside one's own country and is modeled on Finnish and Scandinavian caiques of the German Ausland (i.e. Finnish ulkornaa, Swedish utlandet). As such, it may appear a fairly neutral term, although its root and antonym, cana (homeland), carries tremendous positive connotations in Saami culture. Once abroad, Mannermaa tells us, the merchant "juuttalij kaupugist kaaupujjan" [wandered from city to city]. Itkonen translates the verb, juuttalij - related to the northern Saami verb for seasonal migration, johtit (cf. Yinmshjutaa) - as matkustella[trzvcl around repeatedly] . Mannermaa encapsulates in his narrative the Anar view of life and livelihood and their relation to the outside world. The migration and travel deemed normal in Skolt and Mountain tradition, expressed by juuttalij^ are stigmatized here as dangerous, even irresponsible. The act of leaving even temporarily exposes the merchant's family and home to peril: his wife's faithfulness, the merchant's hidden cache of gold, and his valu- able supply of wild strawberries are all jeopardized by his absence. When the merchant finally returns in Mannermaa's story, he does not simply throw this would-be replacement (a servant) off the high seat (as in certain Norwegian variants of the same legend type, ML 8005;see, for example, Kvideland and Sehmsdorf 1988: 363-4). Rather, Mannermaa's Anar hero banishes the villain in a lengthy moralistic speech: "Tääl oajuh tun vyclgiÒ m&amp;ddal muu tàâluust. Tuu oskolagvuot jà kunnààlàjvuot Hi ambas nüuham. Moona jà hœpanaz, kuo muut kehtidih muu kààlgun kielastallaÒl" BM'£fa tnoonaj olßos jà vuolgij mœddal ton siïdast. (Koskimies 1978: 157) ["Now leave my house. Your faithfulness and honor have come to an end. Go and feel shame for stooping to deceive my wife." The servant went out and left the siida.] The villain is thus banished not only from the house but from the social collective that unites locale and population (the siida). And only with the hero back where he is supposed to be - at home - can life return to normal again. The merchant takes advantage of the crowd assembled for the wedding to preach: uImmccl saanïin jà ton kuàttà et majd vichis maailm käyvilvuoöainis mààtkàn sâttà" [the word of God and</page><page sequence="6">68 Scandinavian Studies about what the cunning world gives rise to through treachery] (Koskimies 1978: 157). He thereby reinsates morality as an Anar insider's knowledge and locates evil in the outside realm. Christian morality, thus, becomes intimately associated with the Anar despite the fact that it was originally imported; the outer world, for its part, becomes the source and reservoir of all evil. Iisakki Mannermaa further develops his notions of the relationship between inside and outside through performing narratives of the cuÒeh cycle. These stories focus on malevolent anthropomorphic spirits (called cudeh) ^ which try to destroy the Saami but are defeated by a young Saami man, usually named Laurukàj. The origin of the cuÒeh narratives lies in part in the historical struggle for land among Saami, Russians, Finns, Karelians, and Scandinavians (Fjellström 1985). Niilo Valonen (1980) suggests that the cuÒeh were Finnic traders in particular. In Mannermaa's account, the mythological term cuÒeh is synonomous with Ruoss-almaah (Russians) and Laurukâj is able to deceive these villains because he speaks Russian. In contrast to the merchant narrative, Mannermaa's cuöeh stories are full of exact detail about places and locations. As in tales collected elsewhere in Scandinavia (ML8000; see Sehmsdorf and Kvideland 1988: 355-5; Christiansen 1964: 13-4), Mannermaa's hero defeats his enemies by using his detailed knowledge of the local landscape to his advantage . In one story set on the Anar island of Saõisuàluj , Laurukâj tricks the cudeh into following his torch over a cliff in the dark; in another tale, the cudeh are tricked into floating into the Tebdokievr|is rapids where they drown. In the latter tale, Laurukà3 convinces the cuÒeh to let him steer the boat: CuÒeh kijttalii ton Heu saanij ooudastjâ oaÔÔâàstillii. Vajbam ko lijjii, toh nohàdii ejdu lusis naharààid.

Laurukàg nuuraj ryeHilij taaußijd kuoska vyelni savonistjà sawoon riddoojn sehepihtasijdjà eres anneemkaaunijd. (Koskimies 1978: 307) [The cudeh thanked him for his good words and lay down. Because they were tired, they drifted off into sound sleep. Laurukàj rowed along the Pac'c'vuona inlet which was not far from the waterfall Tebdokievr|is. As the boat neared the edge of the falls one of the Russians raised his head and said to Laurukáj: "There's a hard wind blowing." Laurukà3 said, "The wind hasn't risen yet; you're just hearing a murmur. I'll wake you up indeed when we get near the village. Sleep peacefully.'' The cuÖehizy back down. Sleepy as he was, he fell back into sound sleep soon. When Laurukà3 saw that all the Russians were sound asleep, he began to row immediately for the waterfall, jumped off onto a rock, and let the boat go over the great falls, where the cuÒeh certainly woke up as the water entered the boat. But there was not an instant to react: the boat capsized in the falls and broke apart. The Russians drowned, and not a one made it to land. Laurukaj retrieved the Russians' bows as well as clothes and metal objects from the still water at the bottom of the falls and along its shores.] Place - specifically local Anar place - becomes an ally in the fight for cultural and communal survival. Laurukàj always acts to save his entire siida from the dangers embodied in the outside cuÕeh^ and he always enlists the aid of the topography in his acts of heroism. Mannermaa's cudeh narratives are typical of his region and closely parallel legends recorded by Pehr Högström during the eighteenth century as well (Fjellström 1985: 385-6). The cuöeh cycle represents an enduring native discourse on the danger from the outsider and the unique relation of the Saami to their land, enacted simultaneously on both a human-historical and supernatural plane. The same association of outsiders with supernatural evil is reflected in Mikko Aikio's performances of the staalo cycle, a group of legends prevalent throughout the Saami cultural area and again associated with Russians among Koskimies's informants. Fjellström (1985), following Laestadius, sees these narratives as referring to more westerly attacks</page><page sequence="8">70 Scandinavian Studies probably from Viking marauders. Kjellström (1976) suggests that the conflict may have centered originally on competition between Saami and Scandinavans for access to a dwindling population of wild reindeer. Mikko Aikio describes stadio as follows: Tovlààjaaigijulmuuhjurdiijà vala täällivjurdeh, etUa nabdemeh häldeehy mob stààllum koccojeh. Tàât stààlu Uj nabdem, et olmooj maatij palvalijjen väldiO, v alaba jiec-uv torn laaunest rähtiO, moozsun mcjdej tnaatij jiegga-uv noaidàstallamààin addetto. Tààm stáálu eä puàhtàm eres kuâulu ulmuuh rähtiÖ kuo ryessiliih. (Koskimies 1978: 209) [In the old days people used to think and still do think that there are certain spirits called staalo. A person can make a staalo for his own uses out of turf, giving it life through magic. No other region's people other than the Russians could make the staalo. ,] This description blends two varieties of outsider, the Russian and the noaide (shaman), which become a unified threat from without. The Russians are designated as kuâulu ulmuuh (people of a certain region) who fashion their evil helper noaiÒâstallatnââin (by means of noaide magic). In a specific account, Aikio says that an Anar man (mottoom almaj anarazajn) was attacked by a Russian staalo after returning from a fishing expedition to the Arctic Ocean: Mottoom almaj anarazajn eelij m&amp;&amp;ra oaggumin jà ton mokken sun nidaskij ruosajgujmjâ toaruustij siißujm. Ton suujast&amp;dduu ryessiliih suu oolajà vuolßattii sunjinstààlu, kote koolgaj koastidiÖ siipeeleest ton Anar-ulmuj. Jâ te sij ustuu vuolgattii sunjin torn stààlu, ko sun Anaran Ujpoattâm. (Koskimies 1978: 207) [An Anar man went fishing in the ocean and while on the trip quarrelled and fought with some Russians. For that reason the Rus- sians became angry at him and set a staalo after him, who was to take revenge on the Anar man. So they sent the staalo after him once he had returned to Anar.] The foreign evil follows the man back into Anar where the hero eventually out wrestles and kills the spirit by drowning. Like Mannermaa's cudeh, Aikio's staalo embodies evil clearly emanating from outsiders and directed against Anar people. A powerful native tradition centering on insider-outsider conflicts is, thus, powerfully created through both cycles. The cogency and continuity of this dis- course is indicated by the fact that many of the same narratives remain</page><page sequence="9">An Inari Saami Case 71 popular in the region a century later in collections made during the 1980s (Saressalo 1987). If these accounts of cuòeh and staalo construct a clear dichotomy between native Anar goodness and outside Russian evil, narrative views of other Saami communities are similarly negative. Typical of such discourse is Juho Petteri Lusmaniemi's account of Skolt Saami magic: Nuorttalas U&amp; Uma¿ tovle tommuséb noaidih, et ko tààlun poaÒiskyetihy te pceivi ordii izzeed puozskuàt. Laej oht tààlu Anaristy kote Uj vuossamujj tohon nuortlazaj peäl. Jyehi touve ko nuorttalas kolgaskyetih poattiÒ, te ajn izzeed puozaskuàt peeivi ordii.

Te ij innig puozaskuàttâm ko nuorttalas pottii. Te toh kaandah kullav ko nuorttalas celkkih: - A ij ni hozzja'in pucgkuattam; ko}st Hi son tiaÒ vua¿¿am. (Koskimies 1978: 245-7) [The Nuortta (Skolt) Saami used to be noaidesoï the kind that could make their host turn ill the day before they were to arrive. There was a certain household in Anar which was the first in the Nuortta's path. Each time that the Nuortta were to come the farmer would become ill the day before. There were two young boys in that household who happened once secretly to overhear a Nuorttawoman saying that if a steel rod were placed in the direction from which they were coming, then the host would not become ill. The boys kept this in mind but didn't tell anyone. Once when the Nuortta were coming again, the boys hid a steel rod facing the direction from which they would arrive. So the host did not become ill when the Nuortta came. So the boys heard the Nuortta saying: "The host did not get sick. Where did they find out?"] By code switching from Anar to Nuortta dialect in the last line, Lusmaniemi emphasizes the antagonistic cultural divisions that sepa- rated the two Saami communities and that found expression in everything from lifestyle to language. Association with the Nuortta is unhealthy, and their magic must be repelled by stolen knowledge. Anar religiosity finds numerous treatments in the narratives of Koskimies's informants. The struggle bctwccnseidi worship and Chris-</page><page sequence="10">72 Scandinavian Studies tianity is recounted in legends of Peeivih-Vuálâppàj, a non-Saami figure reminiscent of the legendary Norwegian Saint Olaf. In general, Vuàláppà3 comes out on top in hi struggles with pagan Saami, Rus- sians, and Norwegians (Koskimies 1978: 316-31), although he is victorious more through his divine strength than through pious ex- ample. Only one of the Vuàlàppâj narratives collected by Koskimies is actually set in Anar (Koskimies 1978: 320-3). In Iisakki Mannermaa's account, Vuàlàppà^ destroys local scidi sites because, sunjin oroskuoÖij vasten, et ulmuuh nüut humoh jà joolah Lea, et väricuuhijd jà keeOßijd immeelniz aneh. (Koskimies 1978: 321) [he thought it horrible that people in their stupidity and foolishness would take mountain peaks and rocks for gods.] Once Vuàlàppà3 has demonstrated his great strength by erecting a fantas- tic local rock formation, however, he is allowed to remain peacefully with the people of the siida and in fact with all the Anar people (Koskimies 11978: 323). Mannermaa, thus, constructs a history of prudent accep- tance by the Anar, in which the Christian outsider becomes incorporated into the Anar landscape and thereby into the Anar heart, an event unpar- alleled in accounts of Nuortta or Russian interlopers. The positive social value he represents - i.e., Christianity - must be incorporated into both the human collective and the physical terrain. Mannermaa does not represent the arrival of Christianity as a tri- umph of outside good over inside evil - a notion that would invert the symbolic system evident in Anar tradition - but instead suggests a process of gradual acceptance through divine revelation. At times, the insider in fact displays greater wisdom and morality than do their Christian colonizers. A case in point is Mannermaa's account of Hanna.

Indeed her parents had always guarded her form whoredom. Indeed, the girl always obeyed her parents in everything. She was a dutiful girl and otherwise mindful of the Lord's word, but the world lured her into its snares so that she became a whore, and as she was living in this state she eventually became pregnant. The girl's parents took care indeed that she at least not be allowed to lose the child, but the girl went into the forest, bore her child there, and killed it.</page><page sequence="12">74 Scandinavian Studies But when the girl went home to the siida, there came two people after her and told everything that she had done in the forest. The girl admitted indeed, now, that she had done wrong and so they went back to their own siida. The girl's parents noticed at once that she had already given birth to her child. The girl was not so brazen as to deny it anymore because the strangers had seen her illicit acts. The strangers, who had seen the girl perform this horrible act in the forest, went and reported the matter to the siida constable [lsensman &lt; Sw Ian + man]. The constable wrote the matter down in his book, just as he had written down other matters. Then one winter the authorities arrived to try cases. The constable notified the judge about how little Hanna had given birth to a little child alive but had killed it. The court summoned Hanna to the place where they were meeting. Little Hanna came before the court and the two strangers. The judge studied the matter and judged that little Hanna must be executed three days hence. The fourth day was the execution day. The executioner who had come along with the authorities, came to Hanna's house and told her bruskly what sort of person he was and what his profession was. At the behest of the authorities, [he] put a new white frock on her, took her by the hand, and walked beside her to the place of execution, which was a certain large rock quite in sight of the Anar parsonage. While the executioner and little Hanna walked to the execution place, people sang from the Finnish psalter the psalm that begins [in Finnish], "Soon after my soul. ..." That psalm was sung through and when the psalm was over the executioner took his axe and thus went with Hanna to the rock where the place of execution had been prepared. The executioner covered Hanna's eyes, placed her neck on the block and chopped through her neck. Many people were standing around the execution place. Suddenly they noticed that there arose from Hanna's headless body something like a star of heaven that rose up into heaven. The people said to each other: "Look! Look at Hanna's soul how it is going to God!" A few cried hard in that place, some wondered what sort of miracle it was which they saw rise from Hanna's body, some thanked God that her soul had passed to God. That was the first and last time a person was ever beheaded in Anar.] Knowing what we know about the symbolic values of place in Anar narrative, certain features of this account stand out immediately. Mannermaa is careful to begin his story with the statement, "There was an Anar girl " The attention of the western reader, I suggest, could easily be to everything but this important specification of location, Anar, if it</page><page sequence="13">An Inari Saami Case 75 were not for the fact that Mannermaa's narrative consistently focuses attention on place - the forest, the rock, the house - culminates in the statement that this was the first and last time a person was every beheaded in Anar. Anar is not just background, but the narrative element that makes sense of the story. The narrator is sure to demonstrate that all other characters besides Hanna come from the outside: the strangers come from a different siida and the authorities from the Finnish bureaucratic system. The touching and human sense of the Anar narrative is expressed in the diminutive Hannaag (Little Hanna), while the cold, impersonal behavior of the outsiders is indicated by the non-diminutive form Hanna, As in the story of the Nuortta, Mannermaa uses code switching to emphasize the division between Anar insiders and Finnish outsiders by quoting the incipit of the psalm in Finnish. Settings are sparingly but significantly detailed: the evil act occurs outside xhcsiida (where members of another siida could witness it), and the execution occurs in Anar in sight of the Lutheran parsonage. The overall message of the story seems clear: although Finnish Lutheranism offers the right way, Anar mercy comes closer to God's will. The intrusive and overly rule-governed Finn- ish juridical system, which had dominated Anar legal disputes since the 1860s, is revealed as unjust and unwise. The Anar seem better able to understand God's will than the Finns, who taught them Christianity, at least on Anar land. In all of these narratives, cultural change is depicted within a frame- work built of images of persistent attachment to the land. Inside and outside remain crucial symbolic categories in nineteenth-century Anar story telling, despite the fact that Lutheranism, literacy, and livelihood had all greatly altered traditional modes of social organization. Koskimies's Anar narratives help us understand why contemporary pan-Saami identity continues - and can continue - to look to the land as a central unifying and meaning making element.
