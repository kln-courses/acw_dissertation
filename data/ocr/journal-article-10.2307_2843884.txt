(Assistant Curator of Ethnology, American Museum of Natural History.) INTRODUCTORY. THis is a brief and preliminary report of an investigation into the thought of primitive children with particular attention to the problem of animism. It was conducted during the winter of 1928-29 among the Manus people of the Admiralty Islands, Mandated Territory of New Guinea, where I worked as a Fellow in the Social Sciences, of the Social Science Research Council. Some reference has been made to these results in my book on the education of Manus children, and in my article on" The Primitive Child."2 I plan to defer full and detailed publica- tion until after I have repeated this experiment among another primitive people. In the meanwhile, since the subject is one of interest to a group of investigators, it seems desirable to publish a summary report of my findings to date. THE PROBLEM. During the last fifteen years two originally unrelated lines of investigation have tended to converge, investigations in child psychology and investigations and speculations concerning the mentality of primitive man. The assumption of M. Levy-Bruhl that the savage was pre- logical, and the assumption of M. Piaget that the thought of the young child differed not only in degree but in kind from the thought of the adult, and was thereby more closely related to the thought of the savage than to the thought of the civilized man, gave rise to some very interest- ing problems. Was it true that there survived in the thought processes and in the institutions of primitive man a type of mentality which was found to be characteristic of young children in civilization ? The findings of Rasmussen, Sully, and more especially Piaget (although his two latter volumes had not appeared in 1928) were strongly suggestive that there were important parallels between the phenomena which the anthropologist had described as animism and the observed spontaneous thought of young children. At the same time this parallelism was essentially inconclusive. The investigator merely compared a series of experiments or 1 Mead, M., Growing up in New Guinea: A Study in Primitive Education.

Such a comparison was suggestive only. A number of problems immediately presented themselves. Was this type of child-thought which confused cause and effect, imputed personality or spirit to inanimate objects and insisted upon an anthropomorphic interpretation of the universe, characteristic of all children of a certain age, or only of children who had been subjected to a particular set of environmental conditions ? Was this type of thought a function of immaturity of intellectual development, or was the disappearance of this type of thinking in older individuals a function of a particular type of education peculiar to western civilization ? Would this type of thought, granting that it were a universal aspect of the child mind, tend to continue and develop in a favourable environment, and was this the explanation of the parallels which could be drawn between primitive institutions and children's spontaneous sayings ? This was essentially a problem which could never be completely solved within the confines of western civilization, hinging as it did upon the differences in cultural milieu between advanced and primitive cultures.' Like all problems which involve the problem of the effect of social environment, results of experimentation and investigation within one social setting can never be positively definitive, but merely suggestive. In 1928 I was awarded a fellowship to investigate this particular problem among a primi- tive people of Melanesia. The exact choice of the Manus tribe of the Admiralty Islands was made upon the basis of various practical considerations quite irrelevant to the problem. Recorded Melanesian cultures all showed a rich institutionalized animism which promised well for an investigation anywhere within the Melanesian area. The problem was phrased as follows: Was the thought of primitive children characterized by the type of animistic premise, anthropomorphic interpretation and faulty logic, which had been recorded for civilized children, or was this type of thought a product of special social environment ? If such thinking were characteristic of the primitive children investigated what was the result of attaining intellectual maturity in an atmosphere congenial to such thought, rather than under the influence of an education informed by the spirit of western science ? THE SETTING. The Manus people are a tribe of lagoon-dwelling fishermen, who live on pile-built houses in the southern lagoons of the Admiralty Islands. They are a brown-skinned, frizzy-haired people of medium stature, approximating somewhat more closely to the Micronesian than to the Melanesian type. They have no sort of political organization beyond a hereditary war leadership in each village; the society is held together by the intricate bonds of kinship and affinal obligations. A Government station has been established in the Admiralties since 1912, and the majority of the men under thirty-five have spent two or three years as indentured labourers on a plantation or schooner or in the police force. The women do not go away to work and speak no pidgin English, the language of the work boy. No mission has yet been 1 The word primitive will be used throughout this paper to refer to those peoples who are completely without the benefits of written tradition.</page><page sequence="3">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Animism. 175 established on the south coast, and the people were, without exception, pagan. Brief descrip- tions of the salient aspects of the culture are contained in Growing Up in New Guinea, and will not be repeated here. All the work was done in the village of Peri during the six months of December to June, 1928--29. I worked throughout this period in collaboration with my husband, Dr. R. F. Fortune, who was making an investigation of the general culture. This circumstance made it possible for me to shorten materially the time which must be consumed in getting all understanding of the general outlines of a primitive culture before any special problem can be isolated and studied. I learned the Manus language, and all work with the children was conducted in it. The Manus language is a simple Melanesian language; a month is sufficient to get a good working knowledge of it; it is strikingly lacking in idiomatic refinements or delicate nuances. In the village of Peri there were 210 people, of whom 87 were young people under or just at puberty. Actual ages were unknown, and only approximations based upon the people's knowledge of relative age could be used. Division into small age-groups was, in any event, impracticable because of the small number of cases. Of the group specially studied, there were twenty-two children, eleven boys and eleven girls between the approximate ages of two and six, and nineteen children, ten boys and nine girls between the approximate ages of six and twelve. These forty-one children were studied under the following conditions: (a) With their parents and their brothers and sisters in their own homes, in canoes, or in other houses during ceremonies. (b) At play in groups in the shallow lagoons. (c) At play in groups on the three small coral rubble inlets which constituted the only level ground in the village. (d) At play on the wide verandahs of our' house which had been built of native materials and with only slight modifications of the native style of architecture. (e) Within the large living room of our house. Here play was sometimes random on rainy days, but more often devoted to drawing. I provided them with a large square table, 8 feet square and a foot and a half high, at which they could kneel and draw. The room also contained a nuinber of low cedarwood boxes upon which the children could sit, or beside which they could kneel and draw. The floor was composed of narrow strips of split timber with wide cracks inbetween, corresponding exactlyto the floor of a native house. The room also contained a high table, three chairs, shelves curtained with a native mat, a " children's shelf," which contained odd bits of coloured paper, string, crayons, pencils, etc. There were a few books on high shelves, a few small photographs on the walls, and a glass Chinese chimes hung fron the central rafter. The children became perfectly familiar with the entire room, and entered and left it without permission from me. They were sent out by the older boys at meal times and during the siesta hour, and sometimes went to sleep on the floor or curled up on a box. They learned to take me very much for granted, accepting the original situation which I laid down that I liked children, that I wanted as many children as possible to come to my</page><page sequence="4">176 MARGARET MEAD.-An Investigation of the Thought of house and stay as long as they liked. I never interfered in any way with their behaviour unless a situation seemed actually dangerous. Although I sometimes took part in their games, I more often claimed to be engaged in my own affairs, and they became accustomed to having me write or typewrite, or apparently read in their midst. Dr. Fortune worked in another house. Environments b, c and e were all combined within easy access of our house, as the lagoon playground extended around it on three sides, and it abutted on one of the small islets on the fourth side. The children were in the water one minute, up on the island the next, sprawling on the veranda or romping through the house the minute after. It should be remarked that Manus children are accustomed to going wherever they like about the village, and are in no fear of adults. The Manus men delight to humour and play with the children, so that my indulgence was in no sense out of character either to the children or to their parents. The children were originally attracted to the house by curiosity, in the wake of the adolescent boys and girls who did the house work, and by presents, balloons, balls, etc., which I dealt out day by day. Later they came to draw, and they came also from a quickly established habit of rendezvous. METHODS. As the existence of a primitive culture was in itself an experimental condition I utilized this fact as much as possible by observation of the children in normal social situations. In order to provide a more controlled situation and also in an attempt to elicit types of material which did not appear under ordinary observational methods, directly experimental methods were used. The methods employed fall under the following heads: (a) Observation of a group of children, or of a child and an adult, or a group of children and adults, etc., in some ordinary social situation. (b) Collection of spontaneous drawings. (c) Interpretation of ink blots. (d) Definite stimuli in the form of questions designed to provoke animistic responses. (a) I handled this material in the form of running notes, with time records in two-minute intervals for certain types of play groups. It included questions from children to adults, children's responses to adult commands, explanations, etc., children's subterfuges, children's responses to situations of emotional stress, such as quarrels, severe illnesses, accident, fear displayed by adults, strangers in the village; birth and death; children's responses to storm, cyclone, animals, fish, birds, shadows, reflections, scenes between pairs of age-mates, between elder and younger children, between fathers and children, between mothers and children, between children and infants. As these observations were all directed towards two particular ends, the definition of the type of child behaviour characteristic of children within the Manus culture, and the analysis of the thought of Manus children with a view to comparing it with the animistic thought said to be characteristic of children in western civilization, I proceeded as follows. Any particular type of situation, e.g. a child's behaviour when threatened by its parents with supernatural punishment was observed each time it occurred until a type response was discerned; from that time on, each situation of the same type was observed, but not recorded in detail if it bore</page><page sequence="5">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Animism. 177 out the type findings based upon previous observations. All deviants or contradictions of the type-finding were recorded in detail. When a series was obtained the deviants were analysed and the deviating child investigated to determine whether special features of the child's family background, mentality, or temperament accounted for the deviation. This method is possibly inferior to the laborious recording by a staff of stenographers of every response made by every child over many months. But one investigator attempting to cope with the difficulties of field-work in a primitive community in the few months allowed by climate and field funds, cannot hope to duplicate the voluminous n4ethods of modern nursery school research. Such an investigator must confine himself to an attack upon the core of the problem and use methods like those outlined above to shorten field labour whenever possible. This method is open to less objection in a primitive culture than in a heterogeneous civilized society, because of the homogeneity of the subject's experience. The number of standardized type responses is far greater in a primitive society than in a civilized one. (b) Drawings were collected to the number of 32,000 over a period of five months. No child had ever used a pencil and paper before. Any attempt at drawing had been confined to one game, outlining a shadow on soft soil with a sharpened stick used as a stylus. This game was only played by the older children and had never, so far as I could judge, been used to make original drawings instead of outlines. At least such use was not known to the group of children which I studied. As beginning drawing with the very young children would have involved actual instruction in the use of a pencil, I decided that a situation more closely analogous to the normal imitative educational situation could be produced if the older children were permitted to draw first and the younger ones led to imitate them. Five boys of about fourteen years of age were given pencil and paper and simply told to " draw," taro we, literally " to make a mark." They had seen us write and they had seen some half dozen Government officials write in record books. The brightest of the group, Kilipak, said, " Let's draw a human being." He and one other boy, Tamapwe, provided leads of this sort which the other three followed. The next day the next younger group, after having crowded about the older boys' elbows, were given pencils, until finally the youngest children were drawing without having received any instruction from me. I never passed any judgment upon the children's work, with the exception of a very generalized " That's splendid! That's fine! " type of encouragement to the younger children. A definite regimen of behaviour was set up. When a child finished a sheet of paper, or tired of drawing with a half completed sheet, he must bring it to me. I wrote the name and date on the corner, and the interpretation of each picture on the paper. This procedure was standardized by the older children also; the older ones spontaneously explained their drawings; when the smaller ones failed to explain their unintelligible scrawls the older children insisted upon an explanation; this very simply became translated into a fixed rule. In this way the drawings bore most completely upon the problem under investigation. For the drawing I used the large standard sheets of coarse-grained buff paper, and the children were given their choice between lead pencils and crayons. The crayons, although coloured, were never popular, and only selected when all the available pencils were in use.; then most of the small children would select black crayons in preference to coloured ones. VOL. LXII. M</page><page sequence="6">178 MARGARET MEAD.-An Investigation of the Thought of This seemed to be accounted for in terms of a preference for a sharp point and a lack of apprecia- tion of colour. Only the fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds after four months of drawing hit on the idea of using the coloured crayons for realistic effects, and this was confined to drawing canoes and boats which they are accustomed to seeing painted. (c) The interpretation of the ink blot test was used as a more controlled way of handling the children's responses. I made my own set of ink blots; they averaged about an inch and a half in greatest dimension, blue on a white surface. The child was shown one at a time and asked " Tito ko no pwa tcha ? ' " What is this like ? " The response was recorded without comment. If a child was slow or shy, I added an encouraging phrase or so: "e ki la," " come on," or " Oi tu pa sani, ne?" " You understand, don't you ? " (d) I also presented the children with a series of problems, utilizing in several cases situations which originally occurred spontaneously. These problems were: (1) The attribution of malicious intent to a canoe which had drifted from its moorings. Ndrol tasitan muan, ne ? i tu wek. That canoe is bad, isn't it ? It's drifting. (2) The attribution of personality to Chinese glass chimes. This was of the type which can be purchased in Woolworth's, rectangular pieces of glass suspended by slender cords from a supporting ring, and a piece of paper suspended from the whole so that the lightest wind will agitate the paper and cause the glass pieces to tinkle against each other. This was hung from a cross-beam of our house. In this experiment I utilized an adult magical concept in an attempt to assimilate the chimes to native ideas of the supernatural. I said the chimes was a ramus, a property-getting charm. Manus adults have a variety of such charms, shells to be worn in the ear or hung on a betel bag, shell crescents with which food is magically crisscrossed, bird claws which are worn hanging down the back, elaborate constructions of grass and pig's tusks on the front house post, special drumsticks which, when used, make people bring the drummer the property for which he is asking-all these and others fall under the category of ramus, charms which cause other people to give you what you ask. It is a thoroughly magical concept, operating automatically without any intermediary. When I hung the chimes up I did so in the presence of adults, and remarked, " This is my ramus. It is crying out for Manus things which I want to take away with me to my own country." The adults accepted this explanation at once. One remarked, " What kind of property does it want ? " Another said, " Is it asking for fish ?" And a third said, " It is calling for beadwork." In presenting it to the children I used this same conceptualization: "This is my ramrus. It cries for native property. What do you think it is crying for now ? I listened also for spontaneous comment upon the little chimes, which tinkled for the next three months whenever the wind blew. (3) Presenting them with a dancing doll of the type which is constructed of paper so that arms, legs and the whole body have a tremendous extensibility like the paper chains made for Christmas trees. When these dolls are suspended they can be manipulated by very slight jerks of the string.</page><page sequence="7">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Arnmism. 179 (4) The attribution of malicious intent to a pencil. When a child had made a drawing which he considered bad and had shown his displeasure by remarking on it: " Tito mucan," " this is bad "; or " Jo no tu taro we ka pwen," " I just drew, that's all," i.e. without definite intent to produce any result (this was a most frequent alibi). I would then seize the opportunity to say, " Pensil muuan, ne. Pensil ne po mangas wiyan pwen," " The pencil is bad, isn't it ? The pencil doesn't do good work." (5) The problem of how the writing on the paper was made by my portable typewriter. This was a question in which the children took a tremendous spontaneous interest from the start. They would gather around the typewriter for an hour patiently trying to analyse the mechanism. I have listed this problem under posed problems, because the typewriter itself was an artificial situation which I had introduced into their environment. (6) The problem of the Japanese paper flowers which open out when placed in water. An atmosphere of expectation was engendered; I remarked that something most important was about to take place; enjoined most careful attention and dropped one of thq paper pellets into a bowl of water, and simply recorded the comments. This problem and No. 3 had to be posed to one child after another in immediate succession to prevent intercommunication. It was, therefore, of a type which it was impracticable to use often, as I did not have the necessary assistance to segregate the children who had taken the test from those who had not. It meant persuading adults to act as warders in what seemed to them a meaningless piece of behaviour. Complicating the native social situation in this way is always of doubtful value, as it is impossible to estimate accurately the repercussions in other departments of native social life. These six problems contained the following elements:- (1) Personalization through ascription of motive to a moving inanimate object. This was a less extreme form of personalization than No. 4, for a canoe is less amenable to control than a pencil. (2) The personalization of an instrument producing mechanical or rhythmical sounds. (3) Presentation for explanation of an object in human form which made apparently voluntary dancing motions. (4) Personalization through ascription of motive and separate will power to a pencil. This problem contained the additional element of offering an acceptable alibi for failure in execution. (5) A mechanical device of such complexity that the connection between the visible movements of my fingers on the typewriter keys and the writing had to be deduced witlout any knowledge of the principles involved. (6) An appearance of greatly accelerated but natural growth, or, alternatively, the pre- sentation of an appearance of wonderful transformation from a pellet into a flower. M 2</page><page sequence="8">180 MARGARET MEAD.-An Investigation of the Thought of RESULTS. (a) Observations of Spontaneous Behaviour. As the investigation was designed to discover and record spontaneous animistic thought as expressed in the conversation, games, etc., of children, I expected this aspect of the investiga- tion to yield the most interesting results. The results, however, were virtually negative. I found no evidence for spontaneous animistic thought in the uncontrolled sayings or games of these Manus children during five months of continuous observations, alone or in groups, when they were unconscious of being observed at all. Before going further it is necessary to distinguish between what I am calling " spontaneous. animism " and a child's acceptance of animistic categories which are explicit or implicit in the. linguistic concepts of its elders. When an English-speaking child refers to a ship as " she," he is not being spontaneously animistic, he is merely conforming to a recognized category of gender. But when a child draws a picture of a steamboat, setting the steamboat on end, inserting a face in one end, and attributing human activities to the steamboat,1 this is spontaneous animistic thought, although it may be, as I shall suggest later, rooted in a traditional linguistic usage. Similarly a child who talks to a dog, or a horse, or a cat, or a parrot, is not necessarily animistic, but is merely imitating traditional adult behaviour. On the other hand, an English-speaking child who has long conversations with a toy engine or with a tree has spontaneously attributed personality in a way which transcends the traditional pattern of its group. Similarly a child who says his prayers and asks God to make him a good boy and not let it rain to-morrow is showing no childish or spontaneous animism, while a child who invents an imaginary play-- mate, holds long conversations with the playmate and reports sayings and adventures of this imaginary playmate, is indulging in a type of thought which may, with due reservations upon how much stimulation the child has received from others, be called spontaneous, and non- traditional. Therefore, I do not class it as spontaneous animism when a Manus child says, " The ghost of the wife of Pondramet married the ghost of Sori last night." In saying this the child is merely repeating a piece of gossip, as he would say, " A woman in the village of Rambutchon has had a baby." The Manus adults believe that the ghosts of the dead live all about them in the village; they are continually in communication with these ghosts through diviners and mediums, and marriages and quarrels on the ghostly plane are often reported by mediums. The children accept the alleged presence of the ghosts in general, and parrot their parents' comments. Only if a child spontaneously elaborated the idea of ghosts, talked with them, saw them, invoked them for his private ends, would I class remarks upon the ghosts as spon- taneous. So when a Manus child calls a pig by name and tells it to come and eat, which is exact reproduction of adult behaviour, I do not call this spontaneous. But had a Manus child ever been seen conversing with a dog or commenting upon a dog's feelings or even addressing a remark to a dog, this would indeed have been spontaneous, for Manus dogs are unnamed and I Fortune, R. F., On Imitative Matgic (MS). Reproduction of a drawing by Priscilla Heale.</page><page sequence="9">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Anirnmsm. 181 never spoken to in words. The natives control them entirely by kicks, cuffs, and a low guttural call. Also when a Manus child explained a woman's sickness by saying she had a snake in her belly, this was merely repeating a doctor's diagnosis, and from the child's point of view was a statement of fact, although the adults knew that the terrific distortion of the woman's abdomen was from no natural snake, but from a supernatural snake. Similarly with the treatment of the concept of the tchinal or mischievous land devil, in the persons of whom the water-dwelling Manus people caricature and express their fear and distrust of their land neighbours. The adult describes the tchinal to the child in an attempt to intimidate him from wandering about at night and to explain to him why his presence is incon- venient when the parent goes to the market at the edge of the land. Tchinals have extra- ordinarily long arms, protruding teeth, hair which hangs matted over their eyes. Their finger nails are as long as their fingers, and they will pursue and eat men. If a child reported having seen a tchinal, or added more and personal detail to this traditional picture, or showed special fear of a special tchinal whom he declared to inhabit a special spot, only in such cases would these be declared to be evidences of spontaneous animistic thought. To summarize, I considered strictly traditional behaviour, whether expressed in language or belief, as insufficient proof that a child spontaneously attributed personality to natural phenomena, animals or inanimate objects, or created imaginative non-existent personal beings. I found no instance of a child's personalizing a dog or a fish or a bird, of his personalizing the sun, the moon, the wind or the stars. I found no evidence of a child's attributing chance events, such as the drifting away of a canoe, the loss of an object, an unexplained noise, a sudden gust of wind, a strange deep-sea turtle, a falling seed from a tree, etc., to supernaturalistic causes. This is the more remarkable when it is realized that if a stone falls suddenly in the bush near an adult, he will usually mutter, " a spirit," and the common explanation of the loss of any small object such as a knife, if the explanation of theft is rejected, is that a spirit took it. In adult theory spirits put ideas into people's minds, are responsible for any insane or un- reliable behaviour-in the native idiom a spirit " twists the neck " of the unfortunate demented person. Also spirits send turtles to their mortal wards, or guide the feet of their wards to the turtles, and it is angry spirits which send cyclones to injure a sinning man's house. Furthermore, the adults believe that one spirit was recently turned into a crocodile, and that carved crocodiles can talk. So in this case the children not only did not construct new and spontaneous explanations to account for the behaviour of natural phenomena, animals or unexplained sounds or motions around them, but they actually largely neglected the stock explanations provided by the culture. The evidence of observation was confirmed by the evidence from the drawings. There were no animals acting like human beings, no composite animal-human figures, no personified natural phenomena or humanized inanimate objects in the entire set of drawings. If a shark was drawn it was drawn either as a mere representation, as accurately as possible, or as part of a scene in which a man was spearing a shark. The sun and moon were not spontaneously selected as subject-matter for drawing; when I asked the children to draw them the sun was indicated by a circle, the moon variously as a crescent and a circle. There was no humanization.</page><page sequence="10">182 MARGARET MEAD.-An Investigation of the Thought of The treatment of spirits was equally scant. I shall discuss this topic under two heads: (1) The treatment of the child's individual guardian ghost, and (2) the treatment of the subject of the general spirit population of the village. (1) Little boys from the age of five or six, with a few exceptions in households where there are several children, have a guardian ghost assigned to them. This is usually either the spirit of a dead male child or a child born on the spirit plane. Occasionally a spirit of a grandfather who has been supplanted by some younger and more recently deceased ghost, will be given to the male child of the house. In theory this ghost goes everywhere with the child to protect him from all spiritual dangers, notably from the malicious attack of other ghosts. In order to appreciate the children's treatment of these guardian ghosts of theirs it is necessary to describe briefly the relationship between an adult male and his Sir Ghost (i.e. the special deceased male relative whose skull is hung in his house and upon whom he relies for protection). A man communicates with his Sir Ghost through a medium, or a diviner. Through the medium he asks his Sir Ghost's opinions, and receives long and detailed replies. Thxough his divining bones, or those of another diviner, he asks his Sir Ghost questions which can be answered by signs meaning yes or no. If he is not a bone diviner he may still consult his Sir Ghost by asking him a question, spitting on a betel leaf and watching which side of the leaf the juice runs down. Before this latter type of communication a man may chat aloud amiably with his Sir Ghost for several minutes. Similarly a man gives his Sir Ghost verbal orders to accompany other members of his household on dangerous expeditions. If asked, a man can tell at once where his Sir Ghost is. All this the children have seen and heard. But to their own guardian ghosts they pay no such attention. Most of them can tell the name of their ghosts, but not always the relation- ship. No child claimed to. have seen his ghost, nor knew of any other child who had ever seen his ghost. Only one child had ever talked with his ghost, and he, Bopau, was regarded as aberrant by his companions. No child was ever heard to ask his ghost to do anything for him, such as help him win a race, etc. When I questioned the older children, aged twelve to fourteen, in more detail on the subject of the helpfulness of their ghosts, they all expressed great scepticism. " Probably he wouldn't be there." " There is no use talking to him. I think he isn't there." ",No, don't ask him. Do it yourself." Also the boys never boast of having spirits when the girls do not, although the men make just this point against the women. Against this background of general sceptical lack of interest, little Bopau stood out strongly. He was the case which deviated from type; if my observations and conclusions were correct the reasons why Bopau took a creative interest in. his ghost where the others did not, should complement my findings in the other cases. This they did. Bopau was an orphan. His father had been dead only two years, and although Bopau lived in the house of his father's younger brother, he was not beloved there. His dead father, Sori, was the Sir Ghost of this younger brother, Pokenau. Pokenau had assigned to Bopau a spirit-child of no importance named Malean. But Bopau claimed that Sori, his father, was his ghost, and that Sori talked with him and he with Sori. He rejected the ghost assigned to him. He was a lonely, shy,</page><page sequence="11">Primitive Children, with Special Referemwe to Animism. 183 unloved child, compensating for his loneliness by imaginary intercourse with his ghostly father. (2) In the treatment of spirits in general the children show very little interest. There are only half a dozen drawings which are said to be ghosts rather than human. These had no distinguishing ghostly attributes. The children hear a good many reports of ghostly activity, some of which they remember. When a child is ill a seance is held over it. Often the child himself, even a child of thirteen or fourteen, does not know the spiritual diagnosis of the sin which has caused his illness. (It is never his sin, but always a transgression of some older relative.) They go to sleep during seances, imitate ghostly whistles to frighten their elders, and use the argument which their parents use to them, " Kor e palit," " the village is ghost-ridden," i.e. dangerous, to keep unwanted younger children from accompanying them on some expedition, and the younger children soon learn to answer, " Kip e aua," " You are lying." The children play no games involving the ghosts. The question of the children's treatment of the tchinals, land devils, differs somewhat in accordance with adult habit. The ghosts are an important constituent of the adult world; adults obviously act most of the time with reference to ghostly wishes; the names of ghosts are always on adult lips. With the tchinals, however, it is different. The parents threaten the children with them if they go to a slightly distant islet to play, yet the parents go carelessly to that islet. The parents speak of the wishes of ghosts, but never discuss tchinals among them- selves. The children accept the concept of the tchinal with good humour, but slight real belief. Once I saw them playing a game of seizing each other and shouting, " I am a Sir Tchinal. I eat men." This only happened once, however. In their drawings- they adopted th-e habit of branding any drawing of a human being which was a failure as a tchinal. Analysis of the drawings of the group and of individuals revealed that there was no style of depicting a tchinal; it was simply a faulty or accidentally grotesque attempt at drawing a human being. Even the traditional aspects of the tchinal, the long matted hair and the long finger nails, did not appear in the drawings. The children not only failed to elaborate imaginatively upon the traditional concept, but they even neglected to utilize some of the salient traditional features. One other point deserves special mention here, the question of reflections in water. The adults believe that if the image of a Manus falls in fresh water, part of his soul stuff will remain there, in the power of a fresh-water demon, and magical rites are necessary to recover the soul. The elders avoid taking children to the mainland because the children will not take this belief seriously, but instead enjoy peering over the edge of the canoe at their shifting images in the fresh water. Tfhis is a case where the children actually reject the concept that the image is an inextricable part of the personality, a prelogical concept which should have been, on the old hypothesis, particularly congenial to the immature mind. (b) The Evidence of the Drawings. This has already been touched upon in the discussion, and can be merely summarized here. The drawings showed no personalization of inanimate objects or animals or natural</page><page sequence="12">184 MARGARET MEAD.-An Investigation of the Thought of phenomena. They showed only a few drawings which were said to be ghosts, although the ghosts occupy fully a third of adult thought and conversation; the drawings of ghosts contained no special features; many faulty attempts at depicting the human form were classed as tchinals. There were no scenes of tchinals eating men or tchincds turning into other things, such as occur in the tales. There were no scenes in which ghosts killed men or stole their soul stuff, or any other scenes depicting the traditional intercourse between ghosts and men. There were no drawings of skulls, although a skull, the bodily abode of the ghost, hung from the rafters of almost every house in Peri. The only scenes which were drawn were strictly realistic-fights, games of ball, boat -races, scenes of fishing for turtle or shark. (c) The Ink Blot Test. The ink blot test also provided no results which indicated a tendency to spontaneous animistic thought on the part of the children. The children's responses could be divided into three groups which have no correlation with either age or sex. (1) Children who genuinely tried to discover what the ink blot was meant to be, and having hit upon an answer gave it with conviction and sometimes with an explanatory detail showing which part of the blot convinced them that their interpretation was correct. Most numerous group. (2) Children who began by an attempt to discover the proper interpretation, but whose interest soon wavered, and who then offered the same explanations in more or less regular alternation throughout the series. So the replies would be dog, pig, man, pig, dog, man, etc. (3) Children to whom the ink blots suggested so little that they had to look about them for suggestions, and then named the ink blot after a pot, or an article of furniture. Least numerous group. A few children followed the pattern already established in their drawings; when the ink blot showed too little resemblance to the object named they would add " of a tchinal." So Popoli said " a house .. . hym . . . I think it is the house of a tchinal." All the children gave only one answer; they did not permit their imaginations to play with the material. Once a child had said, " That is a crocodile," he accepted the ink blot as a depiction of a crocodile, and turned away from it without further interest. The most intelligent children scrutinized the drawings most carefully, and in a few cases failed to find any close counterpart within their own experience. They then suggested things of which they had heard but never seen, " a cassowary," " a telephone " (of which a work boy had brought home the tale), "part of a foreign canoe,") CC a horse.'' The replies did not show a high standard of community response. For example, No. 8 was interpreted as head of a man, island, bird, bird, stone, rat, ball, tattoo mark, pig, mirror, cloud, pepper leaf, tree trunk, a whirlwind, I don't know, human being, a snake, head of a man, human being, mirror, head of a man, pig, pig, pig, verandah, pig, tree, etc.</page><page sequence="13">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Animism. 185 (d) Definite Stimuli. Space does not permit my reporting here in full the answers to the six experimental situa- tions. In this preliminary report I shall merely quote one set of answers for twenty children, and give the type answer for the other five tests.

Girls between three and six years of age. Masa. No; Popolil didn't fasten it. Kawa. No; the punt (used to fasten canoes with) slipped. Maria. No; it wasn't fastened. Pwailep. No punt. Ngalowen. Popoli is stupid; he didn't fasten it right. Sapa. No; no punt to fasten it. Itong. No; it wasn't fastened right. Molung. Not fastened. Saliko. I can fasten a canoe; Popoli can't. Alupwa. No; no fastening; no punt. Boys between three and six years of age. Bopau. No punt through the outrigger. Mee. No punt; bad Popoli. Ponkob. The canoe floats. No punt, no punt, no punt. Pokus. No; where's the punt ? Pope. No; no punt; it floats away. Topal II. Popoli didn't fasten it; Popoli will lose his canoe. Salemon. It will float away; there is no punt in it to fasten it. Tchokopal. No; I fasten my canoe, my canoe, my canoe. Then it does not drift. Pomitchon (aged six). Popoli is a stupid boy; he doesn't know how to fasten a canoe; when I fasten a canoe, it doesn't drift; I understand. The Glass Chimes. (2) The children know very little of the ramus concept beyond applying the name to the wrappings and -pigs' tusks on house posts, which are stationary ramus. Their interest was not caught by the word. They turned instead immediately to studying what made the sound. The type answer for the children of five or six was: " The wind winds the paper.

Then the glasses hit and it sounds." The type answer for the younger children was of this order: " The paper moves. It pushes. It sounds," or " The wind winds. The glass hits. It sounds." (3) The dancing doll.-The responses here were of two types. Some of the youngest children responded first by imitating the loose-jointed movement of the doll. Only afterwards did they speculate on the source of movement. The older children wanted to manipulate the doll at once. Younger child's type response, after imitative dance for a minute: " She pulls the string. It's dancing." Older child's type response: "Let me pull the string and shake it. Let me make it dance." (4) The attribution of malicious intent to the pencil.-Younger child's response: " I drew it." " I made it." "I made it badly." Older child's type response. " No, I didn't make it right," this of one's own work. Bystander comment: " No, she did it wrong." "No, she is stupid. She doesn't know how to draw right." (5) The typewriter.-This was a more complicated problem and mainly interesting for method of attack. The children's first question was: " How does it work ? " Then followed a series: " She hits those white things, there." " When she hits them those things jump."&gt; " There's a string under there." " No, a stick whichb moves when she hits the white things, and then the stick moves and pushed the other thing (type) up." " Then it bits the black cloth and that makes the mark." " Why ? " " There's a mark there," points to type. This was typical for the age of five-six. The younger children watched without comment. (6) The Japanese paper flowers. Younger child's typical response: " The water gets inside and makes it bigger, like a hibiscus " (the Manus have no general word for flower). Older child's typical response: " It's rolled up. The water loosens it. It's like a hibiscus, isn't it ? " In evaluating the accuracy of this response it should be borne in mind that these children have spent their lives in the water, and understand the action of water far better than civilized children. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. The results of these various lines of investigation show that Manus children not only show no tendency towards spontaneous animistic thought, but that they also show what may perhaps legitimately be termed a negativism towards explanations couched in animistic rather than practical cause and effect terms. The Manus child is less spontaneously animistic and less traditionally animistic than is the Manus adult. This result is a direct contradiction of findings in our own society, in which the child has been found to be more animistic, in both traditional and spontaneous fashions, than are his elders. When such a reversal is found in two contrasting societies, the explanation must obviously be sought in terms of the culture; a purely psycho- logical explanation is inadequate. There are two alternative explanations, both of which involve a cultural determinant, which may be offered in the light of the Manus evidence. The contention that a tendency to spon- taneous animistic thought is a function of immature mental development must, of course, be dismissed. It may, however, be argued that the human mind possesses a tendency towards</page><page sequence="15">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Animism. 187 animistic thought, and also a tendency towards non-animistic practical observations of cause and effect relationships. Proceeding upon this premise, the argument would be that in modern society the methods of education now in vogue tend to discourage the animistic tendencies of the human mind, until such tendencies are almost entirely suppressed, while in Manus the system of education tends to discourage the practical non-animistic thought processes so that the growing individual becomes progressively more animistic and less matter-of-fact in his thinking. This theory recognizes a psychological substratum tending towards animistic thought, and allows culture only a suppressive, non-creative r6le. An alternative explanation would disallow the contention that the human mind had a universal tendency towards animistic thought, and limit this tendency as an idiosyncrasy of some human minds only. It would further propose that animistic tendencies of individual adult minds had left their impress upon the human language and human institutions in such a way that an individual born within a human society had a set of animistic conceptions and premises ready-made for his acceptance. Upon this theory children born into our society would first be made animistic by their culture, and then, through later processes of education this animistic tendency would be criticized and in large measure eliminated. Before considering these alternative possibilities further it is necessary to enquire what evidence can be derived from Manus culture. Here again it will be necessary to summarize briefly and leave fuller statement for more extended publication. Analysis of the Manus culture, including the language, religious beliefs, mythology, folk beliefs and methods of education, leads me to the following conclusions. The matter-of-fact nature of Manus child-thought is dependent upon the following con- ditions :- (1) The fact that the Manus language is a bare simple language, without figures of speech, sex gender or rich imagery. (2) The fact that the Manus child is forced at a very early age to make correct physical adjustments to his environment, so that his entire attention is focussed upon cause and effect relationships, the neglect of which would result in immediate disaster in terms of severe punishment. (3) The fact that the adults do not share the traditional material of their culture with their children. These three factors in the situation deserve some further explanation. The Manus language belongs to the Austronesian stock, but it is conspicuously bare, and lacking in metaphor. In the course of hundreds of texts recorded by Dr. Fortune only three similes were found. The use of verbs which apply to the specifically human action of persons to describe the action of inanimate objects is also absent. The wind winds. The sun does not smile or waken. There is only one third person pronoun for all genders. The language provides the child with no stimulating leads to spontaneous animistic thought. Compare this condition with the wealth of metaphor and animistic suggestion in English. Children are taught the distinctions between he, she and it, and then find the moon personalized as "she," and ships described in animistic terms which would bewilder a Manus adult. Children</page><page sequence="16">188 MARGARET MEAD.-An Investigation of the Thought of are taught poetry in which natural phenomena and animals are continually personalized in language and ascribed behaviour. That is, where the Manus language provides no linguistic base for spontaneous animism, the English language does. The second reason, the enforced physical adjustment of the child, is also very important. As I have described the physical education of Manus children at some length elsewhere' I shall not go into detail here. Suffice it to say that Manus children are taught the properties of fire and water, taught to estimate distance, to allow for illusion when objects are seen under water, to allow for obstacles and judge possible clearage in canoes, etc., at the age of two or three. Matter-of-fact adjustment which permits of no alibis, for a child is punished for awkward- ness or physical failure, forces the chilfren's thought along practical lines. Furthermore, the material environment offers no mechanical complexities such as elaborate machines, beyond the comprehension of the child, and so conducive to animistic speculation. The simple mechanical principles upon which a Manus native builds and navigates his canoes, or builds his house, present no mysteries. The child is not discouraged from an attempt at matter-of-fact under- standing by explanations which he cannot follow, nor does the adult find the attempt at explanation too difficult and fall back upon fanciful explanations like the example in which a mother told a child who had already spent hours exploring the internal structure of a piano that the sounds were made by little fairies who stood on the wires and sang.2 Also the Manus adult is careful not to discourage children in their efforts towards a physical control of their environment. Children are never told they are " too little," " too weak," " not old enough " to do anything. Each child is encouraged to put forth its maximum effort, in terms of its indi- vidual capacity always, and not in terms of invidious comparison with other children.3 It is never intimidated. If a child attempts something beyond its capacity it will be diverted, but not openly discouraged. The child is therefore not constrained to manufacture alibis in terms of seven league boots or imaginary playmates who possess the skill and adult licence denied to him. A child's attention is always concentrated upon what he can do now, not upon what he is unable to do. It is unnecessary to labour comparisons with the educational methods of our own society, methods in some measure imperative because of the dangerous mechanical com- plexity of modern life, in some part merely the result of traditional attitudes towards precocity. The third reason suggested to explain the Manus child's lack of animistic thought is the peculiar educational attitudes of the Manus in respect to their non-material culture. Children are taught early and painstakingly how to walk, swim, climb, handle a canoe, shoot a bow and arrow, and throw a spear accurately. They are taught to talk. But they are not given any instruction in the social and religious aspects of adult life, beyond occasional threatenings with ghosts or tchinals, which, occurring only in this particular context, the children soon learn to recognize as bogies only. Children are told no stories of any kind, nor are they expected to be interested in stories, which are for " men and women, not for children." As myths play ' Growing up in New Guinea, chapter III. 2 Quoted by Susan Isaacs in the Handbook of Child Psychology, p. 130. 3 1 have discussed this individual standard of education in an article published in the 18th Annual Report of Schoolmen's Week 1931.</page><page sequence="17">Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Animism. 189 a very slight part in Manus life, and are seldom told-the average adult cannot tell more than four or five complete tales-the children do not overhear them. They are not required to conform to the will of the ghosts; when they are ill it is for an adult sin, and they are neither told nor expected to understand the intricacies of the religious life. They are permitted at ceremonies, but take no part in them, regarding all social, economic and religious ceremonial as tiresome things which adults do, but from which children are exempt. If they were actively shut out from adult life their curiosity might be stimulated; as it is they are prevailingly in- different. Thus it is that they learn very late, near puberty for girls, often past puberty for boys, the religious concepts of the Manus, concepts which would be a rich background for spon- taneous animism if taught them as children, as our children are taught traditional theology, myths and fairy tales. Within the Manus culture itself it is, therefore, possible to find explanations of the dif[erences between Manus child-thought and Manus adult-thought. The language offers no stimuli, the method of education fixes the children's attention along antithetical lines; the adult culture, which provides each generation grown to maturity with a set of traditional animistic concepts, provides the children with no background for animistic constructs. Contrasting conditions occur in our own society, the language is richly animistic, children are given no such stern schooling in physical adjustment to a comprehensible and easily manipulated physical environ- ment, and the traditional animistic material which is decried by modern scientific thinking is still regarded as appropriate material for child training. Upon the strength of one experiment, in one native culture, it is possible to draw only negative conclusions. Animistic thought cannot be explained in terms of intellectual im- maturity. Further research will be necessary to determine whether animism must be regarded as a tendency of all human minds which may be stimulated or suppressed by educational factors or merely as an idiosyncrasy of some human minds, which has become crystallized in the language and institutions of the human race.
