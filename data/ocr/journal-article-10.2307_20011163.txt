TURNER Department of Philosophy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5550, USA I am grateful to Steve Fuller, Andy Pickering and Mike Lynch for providing some interesting suggestions and variations on themes I develop in The Social Theory of Practices. In this reply, I will take up some overlapping themes of the comments, rather than attempt a seriatim reply to each one, and deal with a question that is alluded to in their remarks, the problems of the role of the notion of practices in "political" critique. Let me begin with a brief restatement of the argument. What I criticized in the book was the idea that there was a particular kind of shared thing, which I called non-public collective objects. What I meant by non-public was more or less what Polanyi meant by tacit. Polanyi is vague himself about the notion of tacitness, sometimes meaning simply unspoken, at other times meaning incapable of being spoken. I made a different contrast: between "public" things like utterances, rituals, and texts, and non-public things like presuppositions and norms that the social analyst must infer the existence of from the activities she is explaining. The problem I identified with these objects was that the idea that they were collectively shared, i.e. that everyone had possession of the same thing, required one to believe in a process of transmission, of the insertion of the collective objects into the individual mind or body, that simply defied credulity when fully understood. My objection to these objects was not the "epistemic" one that one can't prove their existence. However, profound methodological issues arise even if one accepts the existence of practices (such as the issue I called the Mauss problem). There is of course a large literature dealing with them, much of it familiar to readers of this journal. Much of this literature focuses on reflex ivity. Melvin Pollner has agonized for two decades over the fact that eth nomethodology not only studies the mundanification of objects, that is to say the construction of problematic factual material as unproblematic, it engages in the same activity with respect to its own subject matter (1987). Steve Wool gar's work on reflexivity with respect to practices of representation constitutes * William Keith organized an "author meets critics" session at the meetings of the Society for Social Studies of Science and did yeoman work in organizing and editing the textual material on which this published exchange is based, for which I am very grateful.</page><page sequence="2">346 STEPHEN P. TURNER another important strand: he wants to see what the implications are of recog? nizing that STS scholars have the same kind of practices of representation they analyze as operative in science. Even opening this Pandora's box is a thought that horrifies some STS scholars, as Malcolm Ashmore has shown in his interviews with major STS figures (1989). My line of attack, however, was quite different. My objection was that the notion of sharing or reproducing the same presupposition, norm, tacit rule, or whatever required causal processes that are far removed from anything in our ordinary experience. Worse, once one takes a hard look at what the causal process would have to do, it is clear that it was simply ludicrous to think that there were such processes. The reason this is an important issue is that it undermines, fatally, a standard mode of explanation, indeed a mode that is so common that we use it unthinkingly most of the time. The "explanation" works like this. When we explain a cultural difference between groups, or a difference in Weltanshauung, habitus, etc. we reason as follows: The people in group A share y, and the people in group B share x. "Sharing" does an explanatory job, since differences between the features of group A and group B are accounted for by the fact that one possesses x and the other y. These differences are not individual differences but differences between the things that one group shares and the things another group shares. To "share," one must share the same thing. So there is a problem about the thing-ness of the thing shared, and a problem about the sameness of the thing that people are supposed to possess. These problems are not very easy to address directly, as these things, Weltanshauungen, habitus, and so forth, are theoretical objects. But there is one aspect of this manner of explanation that can be addressed somewhat more directly. The main nonsensical part of the concept of practice, and the most carefully concealed, was, I argued, the causal side of the notions of sharing and reproduction that is essential to the concept. Put crudely, if people get the same things in their heads, they need to get in there in some way. But it isn't so easy to imagine a way of them getting in there in such a way that the key property of these theoretical objects, their sameness, can be preserved. Indeed, "reproduction" requires some sort of process that is not only unfamiliar from the ordinary and messy experience of putting things in people's heads, such as talking to them or teaching them, but is alien to everything we know about human communication and learning. This is a problem having to do with causality, primarily, and not a problem about the knowability or provability of claims about causal process. The problem is with the plausibility of certain casual claims given what we know about the world, or, to put it differently, about their oddness once they are properly understood. In the book I made much of the curious metaphors that were employed by different theorists in characterizing the locations within</page><page sequence="3">BAD PRACTICES: A REPLY 347 which sharing took place, the residence, so to speak, of practices, in order to bring out both the oddness and to deconstruct the manner in which the issue was concealed by particular forms of expression about the topic.1 But confusion over what sort of objection this is can arise very easily. Sloppy reading is one reason it arises. But there is a deeper reason, namely that the issue of transmission may be understood as an epistemic issue stricto sensu: if we are to imagine that people get the same presuppositions implanted in them we must imagine that they get conveyed through, as I inelegantly put it, an orifice other than those familiar to epistemology, such as the eye and the ear. What we know about the eye and the ear, for example, is that different people hear, see, and interpret in different ways, depending on such things as their past experiences. "Presuppositions" and "practices" are supposed, in contrast, to be "reproduced" without variation inside the people who come to share them. So the notion of the transmission of practices involves a kind of epistemic magic or extension of what we ordinarily take to be within the realm of epistemic possibility. If we concede that there is variation, the whole model of the sharing and reproduction of non-public collective objects falls apart. So does the non individual notion of difference. There is no tacit thing that people share that can be compared to the tacit thing that other people share, and so forth. But if we concede that there is variation life gets much, much easier from the point of view of the problem of causal processes. We can assimilate all the observed facts that practices hypotheses are supposed to account for to the familiar causal phenomenon of habituation. 1. Avoiding the Invisible Lynch and I both accept that there is some domain of fact that corresponds to Polanyi's slogan "we know more than we can say." Pickering is more radical ? or at least apparently more radical. He suggests an alternative account of practices that dispenses with the invisible or tacit part of the concept of practice entirely. Pickering takes up Thomas Kuhn's notion of exemplars, which are, in Pickering's terms, visible things, and in my terms,public collective objects. The work of cultural extension, as Pickering puts it, is the work of extending exemplars or "paradigms as models." One looks, as he says, at a given machine and then tries to build one like it but somehow different. Pickering proposes for himself the question of whether the extension of culture or model itself requires invoking some sort ofthing, such as a culture, which tells the inventor how to extend, or the right way to extend, a particular model. Pickering denies that anything in the present determines how a model should be extended, and even makes the much more radical claim that there</page><page sequence="4">348 STEPHEN P. TURNER simply is nothing behind the business of taking a stab at extending models. So "practice" in this Pickeringian sense is an activity, extension, that happens in terms of public things, models, and depends on no behind-the-scenes apparatus. I am not ready to say that something tacit, which I would characterize in terms of habit, has no role here. Neither does Pickering, once he thinks about it. He goes on to concede that after all the picture needs to be enriched by considering expertise and discipline. Yet he denies that such enrichment entails that the extension of models is any less open ended. More precisely he claims that practice remains open-ended even when disciplined. Taken literally, I find nothing to disagree with in this claim. I don't think that habits are an invisible brick wall, and indeed one of the points I made was that people can acquire new habits and do so all the time. But I also recall Einstein's famous remark that there were children playing in the streets who could solve the problems he faced in theoretical physics but could not solve. What he seems to be saying here is that his habits of mind prevent him from thinking up solutions that a child who lacked these habits of mind would be able to think up. If Pickering said that the extension of examplars are not only not determined, but not even affected by anything like an individual's habits of mind, it would exclude this kind of assertion. I think there is at least a nugget of truth in Einstein's notion, and thus that it is implausible that any extension of an exemplar is equally likely to occur to a scientist or to be taken as meaningful by his or her audience. The reason seven year olds don't solve problems in advanced theoretical physics has to be, at least in part, that they have not mastered enough theoretical physics, that is to say acquired the habits of mind necessary to perform the activity of puzzle solving in theoretical physics. Supplying them with a list of exemplars, as distinct from actually training them, would not enable them to do so: otherwise physics departments could be replaced by day care centers. So perhaps all that is at stake here between Pickering and me is the force of the term "determine." 2. Habits, or Something Else The term "habits" is admittedly an obstacle to understanding my argument. My point in using this somewhat Victorian language was to underline the fact that little more can really be said about the subject, that once we get to the habitual base of practices, the diversity and complexity of the habits makes for what I called opacity.2 Fuller points out that I could have given a much fancier justification of this argument in terms of recent cognitive science, and indeed thinks my account of the acquisition of habits that suffice in social interaction and mutual understanding fits very nicely with connectionism and</page><page sequence="5">BAD PRACTICES: A REPLY 349 connectionist learning mechanisms. But I did not want the argument of the book to be taken to depend on a particular theory in a rapidly changing research area. My picture should fit with any coherent account of the basic facts of learning. Nevertheless, it does fit well with connectionism, and the standard accounts of practices do not, as I have pointed out elsewhere (forthcoming a). The real issue here arises over the question of what is learned, and whether what is learned is "rules." Lynch discusses Polanyi, who, as he points out, falls into the trap I discuss in the book of thinking of practice as itself being based on some sort of hidden rules, rules which are not known as such to the person following them. He makes the useful ethnomethodological point that if one of the arguments against the sufficiency of explicit rules is that they do not fully account for the skilful application that makes up practice, appealing to inexplicit rules that somehow avoid the problem of insufficiency and the vagaries of application does not help matters. But Lynch hints at some sort of alternative way of thinking about practices which avoids the idea, which I take to be central, that practices have some sort of causal reality. He suggests that while many Wittgensteinians, phenomenologists, ethnomethodologists and pragmatists would agree with the rejection of the idea of rules behind the rules, they would also reject a thing-like notion of practices of the sort I criticize. I have my doubts about this de-causalizing strategy, though I think his point is right: some Wittgensteinians, pragmatists, and the like don't buy into a prac? tices model, some do quite explicitly, and some others who don't explicitly buy into the model I criticized nevertheless speak in ways that make sense only in terms of that model. The model attracts those who employ it as an alternative foundation or explanation-stopper. These people are closet foun dationalists, who think they have found a substitute for those now-discredited "foundations" in the form of "community practices." To serve this purpose, practices must be a fact of a different type than the things that it grounds. If scientific activity is grounded on social practices, for example, the practices are a fact that is extrinsic to and constitutive of scientific activity or discourse itself. If this "different kind of fact" it is not thing-like or causal, I don't know what it can be ? though there is obviously a tradition, going back to Kant, of trying to find some other category to put it in.3 In Kant's case, it will be recalled, the strategy broke down when it became obvious that the categories, which he had located in the general intelligence, were in fact historical and changeable. In general, the problem of historical change pushes one into the causal realm. Foucault is a good place to start on this issue, because Foucault is an heir of Kantianism who goes out of his way to adopt a vocabulary that evades all these issues. Foucault's basic gimmick was to say that the means, especially</page><page sequence="6">350 STEPHEN P. TURNER the discursive means, that had begun as the instruments of intent became the creator of intent. "Men believe that speech is their servant, and do not realize that they are submitting themselves to its demands," to quote Foucault in full cliche-generating mode (quoted in Harpham 1995, p. 12). I said that "power knowledge techniques are not instruments or collective purposes but collective means which subject their users" ( 1994a, p. 55). As this quote shows, Foucault was fond of using anthropomorphic metaphors that are difficult to cash into causal terms. My claim is that Foucault is as much trapped by the problem of causality as Sumner was, and his failure to address it is a culpable omission. Let me give a very simple example from Foucault's early writings. In The Birth of the Clinic, Foucault argued that the transformation of medicine after the "classical" period consisted in the creation of a new kind of "gaze," the clinical gaze. Presumably the characteristics of physicians after the revo? lution included the possession of the "clinical gaze," and the clinical gaze presumably was shared between them in the following sense: Each physician possessed the capacity to perform the clinical gaze and viewed patients as objects constituted by this gaze. The new medical world was the world con? stituted by this gaze. The striking innovation in Foucault, what I called his gimmick, is his inversion of the standard strategy of Ideologiekritik. Rather than saying that physicians had a common interest that led them to adopt a certain medical ideology, he argued that they had a certain common pos? session which created a world for them: a world in which they had interests and in which they sometimes articulated medical ideas that followed from their novel form of perception. The "gaze" is the common possession, the non-public collective thing, that explains the public things. Foucault's jargon subsequently evolves: notions like "gaze" were too limited. But the basic logic of the usages does not change. In the book, Foucault makes a great deal of the slogan "open up a few corpses" and the idea, which he takes to distinguish this period of medicine, that the observation of internal body tissue and especially its visual intangible properties (1963/1973, pp. 124?174) created a new conception of disease and health and consequently of medicine, or as he says, leads to "a reorganization in depth, not only of medical discourse, but of the very possibility of a discourse about disease" (1963/1973, p. xix). But it is important for him that the slogan and the actual knowledge that physicians passed between one another about disease not be a sufficient account of the change. Foucault wanted to characterize the change in medical practice as something akin to what Kant called a Copernican Revolution, that is to say a fundamental change in the way the world is constituted for the observer. The question I asked was whether, if there are such things as gazes that are collectively shared by, for example, the physicians of a particular epoch, how,</page><page sequence="7">BAD PRACTICES: A REPLY 351 precisely, does his sharing come about? What causal process enables the same thing, the gaze, or more generally a practice, to be "shared"? As a historian, Foucault does give a kind of an answer to this question, namely to appeal to the phenomena of discipline and training: he makes much of the whole business of medical education (1963/1973, pp. 45-50, 57-63). My point is that these facts about education do not produce the specific results that Foucault needs in order to claim that practices are shared, and consequently gives inadequate reason to suppose that there are such things as shared practices or "gazes" at all. My claim would be that explicit ideology- i.e., slogans, such as "open up a few corpses," together with habits derived from the participation in successful performances of certain kinds of public activities, such as supervised human dissection, suffices to account for all of the disciplinary phenomena. There is no explanatory need for a "gaze." At best, it is a high level ideal-typification of a certain era of medical practice. The stuff that is typified is both mundane and diverse: physicians had different experiences, and acquired different habits. They were treated in similar enough ways and had similar enough experiences to be usefully typified as different from previous physicians. But it is a large leap from this to the Foucault's notion that they shared a "gaze." To be used in the way Foucault uses it, the gaze has to be an object, something that comes into existence at one moment in history, is shared, and so forth. Whether some sort of non-object like account of practices of the sort Lynch alludes to can be treated as a historical object in this way is an open question. I would be very curious to see how it could be answered, but I suspect that any plausible answer would have to collapse the concept of practices into something akin either to mine or to Pickering's notion that the common material of the practice is in its public objects. 3. Foucault and Weber Foucault's "gaze" might be better thought of as an ideal-type. But ideal-types have their problems too. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber needs to connect the phenomena of reformation Protestantism with the quotations from Benjamin Franklin of several centuries later with which he begins his account. If there is no transmission here, I am at a loss to understand what connection could possibly exist between the two phenomena. But Weber is quite unhelpful with respect to this problem. As I have argued at length elsewhere (Turner and Factor, 1990), Weber uses the concept of the ideal-type in an odd way that allows him to avoid appealing to a notion of practices. He identifies the ideal-type with the fully articulated, fully conscious form of an action. But he promptly admits that most action is not fully conscious and that people usually don't know the reasons for their actions. Yet he insists that</page><page sequence="8">352 STEPHEN P. TURNER it is methodologically permissible to assimilate the semi-conscious, semi articulated cases to the clear cases that form the ideal-type. So the use of the ideal-type gets Weber something akin to the thing that the clinical gaze gets for Foucault. It enables each of them to identify an object that is in some sense shared by all the people they wish to discuss and explain. Weber sees that what he has is an idealization. Foucault, however, has to think of the gaze as an object-like thing, a kind of natural fact the possession of which explains the commonalities between the overt actions of the med? ical practitioners he is examining. Indeed, as I have suggested, he is led to anthropomorphize, as in the phrase quoted above, where he uses the language of master and "servant," and the idea that people "do not realize that they are submitting themselves to its demands." Weber is much to be preferred on this point. But Weber's argument is pretty strange itself, and for closely related reasons. There is something fishy about Weber's leap from similarities to the ideal case to the notion that people who do not consciously possess a particu? lar articulated religious ideology, such as predestinationism, are nevertheless in some sense causally affected by it. I would suggest that what is really happening in the Protestant ethic case is that there is, in addition to a highly variable body of doctrine, a very large set of rather vivid public lessons, preserved in the memory of Protestants by their public retelling, and also a number of what might be called behavioral technologies, such as the worship service, rituals of exclusion and punishment, and much much more, all of which is "public." One can trace the explicit ideas, for there are plenty of sermons in which they are formulated, and one can come to understand the effects and habit producing consequences of the various rituals and performances, such as the conversion experience and its public retelling. One can then reasonably infer that these had pretty profound effects on believers, including believers who never heard of the specific Calvinist doctrines that Weber's account refers to in constructing his ideal type. I think this remedies the theoretical problem with Weber's account, but it also requires modifying it. And the modifications need empirical work to support them. So what I have done, pace Lynch, is not simply to offer a redescription of the things formerly known as practices: The redescription suggests specific kinds of causal mechanisms that need to be there and can be, in part, investigated. 4. Discipline and Transformation Fuller makes a distinction between the idea that physicians "share practices" and the more mundane idea that they simply agree to be accountable for acting under common standards. This distinction is too big for my tastes.</page><page sequence="9">BAD PRACTICES: A REPLY 353 I think there is something that falls between the two. A neglected feature of the study of science and the formation of scientific communities is the ruthless winnowing out of people who just can't do the standard tricks, for example the problem solving of physics or chemistry, or the tasks of biological observation, correctly. The doing of standard tricks, such as identifying and drawing the right organd?es when looking through a microscope, are at once habit-producing (or disciplining) and screening rituals. Performing them properly or failing to perform them properly is one test one must pass to be a member of the community. These are public tests. There are only public performances that exhibit diagnostic skills or fail to exhibit them. Jumping through standard hoops is perhaps a matter of "agreement on standards." But jumping through the relevant hoops is transformative in a way that merely entering into an explicit agreement is not. Examples of this may be found everywhere: The breaking down of ordinary ways of thinking that accompanies legal education, and the recognition that one now "thinks like a lawyer," for example, is the result of going through public hoops, like answering questions in first year law classes, that work inner transformations; making someone a surgeon works in the same way. Both involve acquiring habits that transform the person who acquires them, and Foucault and I agree on this. We differ on the way in which the process gets described. Lynch suggests that this is all my book does - redescribes the familiar in less loaded terms - and that it offers no novel suggestions for investigating the phenomena. I think that the argument has some important implications for inquiry, such as those I outline above in connection with Weber, though I did not discuss them in the book. The main point is this: I suggest that the causal relationship between the habits and capacities that people acquire and the public performances that they give has been reversed by the notion of practice and its kin. The real relationship, I propose, is that the public performances cause the habits. Thus I argue that the study of the tacit or habitual parts of practice should begin with the public activities which must be performed and which form habits. From that starting point we should look to see, as far as possible, how those activities work to do so. We can make more sense out of the nature of common life by seeing rituals as behavioral technologies that produce habits, and we can even see the transformative effects on individuals of mastering intellectual works - say, the writings of Heidegger- in terms of the habit-of-mind-producing effects of attempting to understand them.</page><page sequence="10">354 STEPHEN P. TURNER 5. Practices as a Political Idea Why would anyone have adopted the odd conceptions of practices described in the book? Fuller gives a kind of broad externalist historical explanation for its attractions. I alluded to the narrower context of the problem of democracy in the mid-nineteenth century, in which thinkers like Taine puzzled over the question of why, if constitutional form was so important, were so few countries able to imitate the limited monarchy of Britain. The notion of tradition, as well as the notion of the "actual government" appealed to by Austin, are essentially conservative arguments. I commented at one point that the idea fashionable in the late 19th century that only those nations with a millennium of moot courts behind them were capable of democracy, which I called the theory of multi generational marination, was causally ludicrous. There is also a "critical" use of the concept of practices, not limited to Foucault. Neo-Kantians, and their anglo-American admirers like E.A. Burtt, liked to regard science as resting on rationally indefensible presuppositions and therefore as epistemically equivalent to other forms of intellectual life also resting on rationally unjustifiable presuppositions. We now get the same argument phrased in terms of practices, with a new twist: That science, for example, is the product of signifying practices that conceal the interests that science actually realizes, such as patriarchy, by creating the appearance of objectivity and universal validity.4 These usages are so pervasive today, especially in feminism, with its concerns with the conceptual practices of power and standpoints, that it is difficult to see what much of it would be about without them. In the end, the concept is defective whether it is employed to debunk or to give a mystical justification to conservativism. This ought to be all there is to the matter: Both uses get debunked, and both deserve it. But it does seem that writers like Foucault and Hacking, and Gramsci and Lukacs before them, are on to something when they use these concepts to extend Ideologikritik to tacit ideologies, constitutive concepts, and the like, and that an arbitrary self-denial of these weapons of analysis amounts to a defense of the status quo. If making up compelling stories discrediting those we disapprove of is an end in itself, this conclusion perhaps follows: Critique, as a rhetorical activity, is crippled by overscrupulousness about things like causal processes.5 Foucault, I am afraid, shows where this reasoning leads. Realizing that the historical happy ending of Gramsci and Lukacs, the master narrative of Marxism, was a fake, he was reduced to seeing critique as politically irrelevant, irrelevant in the sense that the structures of power he revealed could not really be taken away, as capitalism was supposed to be taken away, but could only be recognized for what they were. This is the Grand Hotel Abyss, albeit in the cheaper rooms.</page><page sequence="11">BAD PRACTICES: A REPLY 355 Causal knowledge, in contrast, allows us to change the world. It allows us to intervene, to act politically. To be sure, in this case, the promise of intervention is nothing like the promises made by Gramsci and Lukacs. The mass of habits formed by experience, by what I call rituals, by tests, and by the individualized habitualization of explicit ideas is not amenable to the interventions fantasized by Marxism. But recognizing the significance of these causal phenomena is surely politically better than indulging in fantasies about new Socialist Man or despairing about our relation of servitude to our master, discourse. A bit of intellectual history is important here. I mentioned Taine earlier. The concepts I discuss in the book arose, in their nineteenth century form, in response to the failure of political actions taken by people who thought that institutional change was all there was to politics. But they learned that manipulating constitutional structures didn't help much, and didn't produce the results they desired. This was a good lesson to learn. But they overlearned it, and their theoretical conclusions from these political facts were wrong. There are no such things as mores, collective consciences, social wills, and the like. I wish to preserve the small truth in these thinkers that can be preserved: We are not aware of, and tend to greatly underestimate, the extent to which we are transformed by the particular limited experiences that we do have, and by the rituals we participate in. Notes 1. I pointed out that at least thinkers like Durkheim did us the favor of fleshing out the notion of shared psychological properties: Durkheim's concept of the collective consciousness is fully elaborated and therefore open to criticism. The problem, of course, is that the notion of collective consciousness requires very strange causal mechanisms operating within very strange "minds" which are divided between social and individual components, one of which is shared and supraindividual. No one, I take it, entertains seriously such a causal model of mind today. But it gives you an idea of what one needs in the way of casual machinery to make a "sharing" account work. 2. Margolis, who does try to say something more about the habits of mind that figure in the history of science, winds up with a vocabulary that is no different from that of the philosophy of science, and thus fails to add much to our understanding of the processes involved (Margolis, 1992; Turner, 1994b). 3. As I have suggested elsewhere, I think the thing that makes The Rules a classic is that Durkheim faces up to this problem: representations are, he argues, themselves real things with real causal properties (1995) 4. These arguments are widely available, and in very crude forms (e.g. Jordan and Weedon, 1995, pp. 10-11) 5. Hacking I have dealt with elsewhere. The compelling character of his story of the history of the concept of child abuse, I show, depends on the artful omission of various contextual facts (Turner, forthcoming b).</page><page sequence="12">356 STEPHEN P.
