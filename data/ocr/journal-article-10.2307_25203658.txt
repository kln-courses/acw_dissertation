<plain_text><page sequence="1">TASKS, METHODS AND RESULTS IN THE STUDY OF THE INDUS SCRIPT By Asko Parp?la 1. The Indus script is at present known from about 3,000 inscriptions1 with an average length of only five signs.2 The longest continuous text (1400)3 comprises only 17 characters divided over three lines. There are no bilingual inscriptions. Also, direct historical data relating to the Indus civilization are extremely scanty, being limited to the scarce references in cuneiform texts of the 3rd and early 2nd millennia b.c. to trade and other contacts with Meluhfca, the most distant country known to the Mesopotamians of those times, whose identity with the Indus civilization at the period in question is now widely accepted.4 More texts in the Indus script are, and will be, forthcoming from recent and imminent excava tions,5 and perhaps the excavations that are under way in ancient LagaS will bring to light the long-expected bilingual, possibly in the form of a cuneiform document mentioning Meluhhan proper names and bearing the impression of an Indus seal.6 In the absence of such a clue, the prospects of ever understanding the Indus script have generally been con sidered rather meagre.7 This pessimistic attitude has long been obstructing progress in the study of the Indus script. The very first point I should like to make is, that despite the scantiness of the material, it is indeed possible to promote our knowledge in many ways, and that important results are sure to come from more work by more people. One of our greatest needs at the moment is an increase of interest in the Indus script, and the co ordination of scholarly efforts. 2. A clear definition of objectives belongs to the routine tasks of scientific research. Knowing exactly what one is looking for is of help in finding the right means for attaining the goal. In our case it would, for instance, be particularly useful to reach general agreement with regard to the criteria by which a decipherment of the Indus script can be accepted as valid. Since most attempts have violated one or the other of them, I shall make the following explicit statements, hoping that they may be refined in future discussions. Our primary goal is an interpretation of the Indus script which fits neatly in with all available evidence and, at the same time, gives it a meaningful and plausible explanation. This solution (which can, and most probably will, be partial only) must be systematic and consistent, and in agree ment with the corpus of accepted knowledge, in our case especially the history of writing, 1 All known inscriptions (with the exception of those consisting of one sign only, and a few others enumera ted in MSIS, I, viii f., and to be published in MSIS, II) are included in MSIS, I. The chief sources with photographs of the originals are Marshall 1931, III, PI. CII-CXVIII; Mackay 1938, II, PI. LXXXII CIII; Vats 1940, II, PI. LXXXV-CIV; Mackay 1943, PI. LI-LIII; IAR; and Gadd 1932. For the rest, see MSIS I, xvi f. ?cf. A?S/S, I, ix f. 8 For the method of citing the texts by means of four-digit numbers see MSIS, I, xvi. 4 cf.

The results of the decipherment should further be testable by objective and, as far as possible, independent means.s The absence of bilinguals is partly compensated by the presence of two other kinds of effective control. One is provided by all the contexts in which a given sign occurs, including ligatures in which it may be combined with other signs. This test is the more effective the more one can read of the script, as in a crossword puzzle, and, naturally, in proportion to the sign's frequency of occurrence. The principles of poly- and homophony, though known from the Mesopotamian scripts, cannot be accepted as a working hypothesis, for on one hand it would nullify this control,9 and on the other it is not theoretically justified. In Mesopotamia it largely results from the complex history of successive borrowing of the writing system by peoples speaking different languages,10 while the Indus script throughout its existence remains the same with regard to the sign sequences, which rules out the possi bility of a language shift.11 Another kind of test is supplied by the historical context: the Indus script is not an isolated phenomenon, but an integral part of the Indus civilization, which in its turn did not flourish in a vacuum. The inscriptions reflect not only the language of the Harappans but also their religion, social organization, and so forth, for the recon struction of which we possess some means that are independent of the script, such as archaeological remains, the theory of anthropology, and later Indian tradition. A multi-sided approach using all available sources is also needed, not only in order to obtain a result as objective and controllable as possible, but because the material is so very scanty. One must constantly try to follow up all clues, and to find new ones. If progress is made along one line, it should immediately be tested against the rest of the material and used positively for further research. Conjectures must be made, even if many even of those that at first seem promising lead to inconsistencies and dead ends as the work progresses; but, as in solving a crossword puzzle, one must abandon what turns out to be wrong, and, sticking to what seems to be right, incessantly seek better solutions.11 As in all scientific research, the tests must be as hard as possible, while the hypotheses should be as detailed and cf. Bunge 1967, especially I, 9 f. cf. the decipherment of Hrozny (1941-2), who proposed exactly the same phonetic value for very many diff?rent signs, and also many different values for one and the same sign. Cf. also the remarks of Emeneau 1954, 283. 10 cf., e.g., Doblhofer 1973 (1961), 142 f. 11 An exception is found in the round and cylindrical (but not the native Harappan square-formed) Indus seals found in the Near East, whose sequences differ radically from those of the Harappan area; they are probably written with Indus characters but in the Sumerian or some other Near Eastern language.

They contain many wrong guesses and errors especially in the handling of the Dravidian linguistic material, which was new to us. I have since been trying to develop further such of our hypotheses as seem correct, by taking into account the criticisms offered especially by Clauson and Chadwick 1969; Burrow 1969; Friedrich 1969; Gurov and Knorozov 1969; Schmid 1969; Romila Thapar 1969; Pandit 1969; Lai 1969; Sircar 1969; Wikander 1969; Lienhard 1969 and 1974; Leemans 1970; Zide and Zvelebil 1970a and b; Mayrhofer 1970; Trautmann 1970; Vacek 1970; Berger 1970; Brice 1970a and b; Marr 1971 ; Emeneau 1971 ; Filliozat 1972; Zvelebil 1973; SevoroSkin 1973; and by learning Dravidian.

A number of further attempts at deciphering the Indus script have been published in recent years, but they cannot be taken into account here, and many contribute very little to the subject.

The comparative study of signs, their syntagmatic positions, and frequencies of occur rence, has played a central role both in cryptography and in the decipherment of ancient scripts.14 Preparation of all kinds of indexes to the Indus texts is obviously among the most important tasks, the realization of which is needed for a successful decipherment. The sign lists and concordances by Gadd, Smith, Vats, and above all Hunter, which were published in the 1930's (see Bibliography), are now in many respects insufficient. A computer-drawn concordance to the pairwise occurrences of the Indus signs, quoting for every combination all the inscriptions in which it occurs, with source references and codes for iconography and type, has recently been published by our research team (MSIS, I). Fig. 1(a) shows a sample from a page of this concordance with explanations; the other sample (b) is taken from the reverse index quoting the frequencies of occurrence in various positions within the inscrip tions for each of these combinations. Other volumes are in preparation : they will contain an indexed critical edition of the texts, arranged in numerical order after the call numbers and also according to their length; a sign list recording the graphic variants as well as the frequencies and places of occurrence for each sign; a similar list of the iconographie motifs, lists of frequencies sorted according to the number of occurrences, and so forth. It will be useful, I think, to take up for discussion here some tasks and problems involved in this work. The readings of the texts have so far been checked against the original documents in the museums of Karachi, Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, London, Oxford, and Paris. This collation has removed a number of uncertainties concerning the inscriptions, and displayed many things that could not be learnt from the publications. For instance, it was possible to estimate the length of broken portions from the position of the central hole or knob on the reverse side, which is usually not shown in the photographs. The work, however, also raised a new problem, that of the present location of over 1,000 published inscriptions which could not be traced in these museums.16 On the other hand, the checking of their collections brought to light more than 400 un published texts that have been lying forgotten for some 40 years. Their existence has passed unnoticed, because they come from excavations carried out at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa after those that have been properly reported, these being only superficially mentioned in the seldom-consulted old Annual Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India.16 The new in scriptions thus recovered, a welcome addition of some 20 per cent to our scanty corpus, have been included in our concordance, but the material should be properly described with photographic illustrations. Because the photographs of the archaeological reports are not always satisfactory, and because these reports themselves are out of print and inaccessible to many students of the Indus script, a new photographic edition of high quality, comprising all known Harappan seals and other inscriptions in one volume, is urgently needed. A proposal made to this end in 1973 has been approved by various authorities, and it may be hoped that 13 cf. Bunge 1967,1, 12. 14cf. also, for the decipherment of ancient scripts in general, Aalto 1945; Ventris and Chad wick 1956; Friedrich 1966; Gelb 1963 and 1973 (especially pp. 274 ff.); Gordon 1971; Doblhofer 1973 (1961); Barber 1974. 16 The Chanhu-daro seals (Mackay 1943) in Boston and a few stray seals elsewhere have not yet been collated. 16 cf.

Several different proofs have been adduced to show that the direction of writing nor mally is from right to left, and boustrophedon in at least some inscriptions with two or more lines.17 There are, however, cases where the writing is to be read from left to right. These have been normalized in our concordance, but in using it one should bear in mind that a few uncertainties in respect of the directions of writing remain unsettled. The same applies to the order of multi-sided texts and the discrimination between allographs and graphemes.18 Due to technical difficulties we could not, unfortunately, fully consult the concordance when preparing the text on which it is based. One of the immediate tasks has been its use for improving the readings of the texts, and a study of the combinations involved has already helped to overcome these problems in a number of cases.19 We intend to issue a second, enlarged and revised edition of the concordance when the unpublished inscriptions from the Lothal and Kalibangan excavations become available. In the meanwhile, the forthcoming edition of the texts will have to serve as a corrective. 4. Though our concordance is still far from perfect, it provides adequate means for tackling several tasks that are vital for the analysis of the Indus script. One is the division into words, which is not marked in the inscriptions themselves. Word division is intimately linked with the isolation of inflexional elements. Because there is considerable disagreement whether this or that sign should be regarded as a word sign or as a grammatical element or both,20 17 cf. Gadd and Smith 1931 ; Hunter 1932 and 1934; Ross 1939; Lai 1966 and 1967-8. "cf. MSIS, I, x ft. 191 should here like to make some corrections to the sign list of MSIS, I (pp. xxii-xxvi). The following signs are allographs: 67 - 69 (cf. p. 287); 157 ? 158 (cf. p. 241); 265 ? 357 = 356 (cf. pp. 19, 115, 144, 218 and 220, 259 f.); 297 = 300 (cf. p. 501); 346 *= 347 (cf. pp. 163, 474); 288 = 289 (cf. p. 348); 385 = 386 (cf. pp. 116, 504). The page numbers in parentheses refer to MSIS, I, where the contextual evidence can be seen. The identity of 208 and 209 is possible but uncertain (cf. the inscription 1410). The sign number 170 is to be deleted, being based on an erroneous copy made by Hunter, which had to be relied on in the absence of a photograph now available. I would draw attention also to the recent work of I. Mahadevan, who has undertaken to compile independently concordances to the Indus texts by computer (cf. Mahadevan and Visvanathan 1973; Mahadevan 1973). When published, they will provide a useful check and contribute substantially to the critical study of the Indus script. 20 An important controversy between the Soviet scholars and us, for example, concerns the sign i, which our Soviet colleagues take to be a case suffix and more particularly that of the dative, while we interpret it as both an independent word meaning "woman** and as a feminine suffix.</page><page sequence="6">TASKS, METHODS AND RESULTS IN THE STUDY OF THE INDUS SCRIPT 183 it is pivotal to find reliable criteria for word division. Basically, I think, one should to begin with operate with entire inscriptions only, and by comparing them with each other isolate word boundaries.21 Short inscriptions, and especially those consisting of one single sign alone, are particularly important. A single sign forming an entire inscription cannot, in that case, be a grammatical element, but a full word. An important key to word division is pro vided by inscriptions with identical combinations but a different order of sequence.22 The isolation of the grammatical elements is another extremely important task, which will have to be studied systematically. Here it is, again, ail-important to reach agreement with regard to the criteria. At least one or more of the following characteristics are required of the candidate signs: a high frequency, a tendency to combine with many different signs, a stable position before or after the "stems", and a paradigmatic alternation in identical contexts.23 As far as the phonetic values of the different signs of the Indus script are concerned, it is not possible to set up a grid of the internal relations between them in the same way as in the decipherment of Linear B.24 The latter made use especially of paradigmatic alternations, while there seems to be rather little inflexion in the very short Indus texts. On the other hand, the signs obviously do not consist of open syllables alone, as those of Linear B do, but also of closed syllables and probably even of bisyllables, as in the other writing systems of the 3rd millennium b.c.25 There are, however, some other means of detecting phonetic and semantic relations between various signs. One of the most important clues is provided by ligatured phonetic indicators, an example of which will follow (cf. below, ? 9). Determina tives apparently occur, too. A comparison of the following two inscriptions shows that the sign x is redundant in this context, and has been ligatured with the sign || only in order to specify either its phonetic or its semantic value (cf. Fig. 2): m 9* Fio. 2. The ligature ft links one further sign, 1, with the signs X and 11, either through sound or meaning, or possibly through its adding a compounded word or a grammatical suffix. Universals of known script systems offer another starting point in addition to an analysis of the graphemes. Thus signs occurring only seldom, and in particular contexts, often express one single concept or word only, while signs with a high frequency and many different com binations stand often for common mono- or bisyllables that can assume several different meanings, either as words or grammatical elements. We have tried to develop an automatic multivariable classification method of general validity that would isolate phonetically "cf. F?4, 11 f. " cf. the examples in FA, 62. 23 cf. FA, 19. u cf. Ventris and Chad wick 1956 Zide and Zvelebil 1970a, 128, refer to Linear B, and consider the lack of such grids as one of the most serious drawbacks of the FA; yet we did present some (pp. 18 f. and pp. 45 f. and 64 f.), the last-mentioned references being examples of grids of graphemes that they also missed, "cf. Gelb 1973,261 f.</page><page sequence="7">184 TASKS, METHODS AND RESULTS IN THE STUDY OF THE INDUS SCRIPT meaningful groups quite mechanically on the basis of neighbouring signs only. Samples of several known script systems have been used as test material, and the results encourage us to develop further such techniques as are made possible by the computer.26 5. The routine formulae followed by certain text categories provide one of the most impor tant clues to unknown scripts. One needs only to remember their role in the decipherment of the Old Persian edicts.271 shall concentrate in the following on the most important cate gory of the Indus inscriptions, the seals, but wish to point out that there are other categories, too, many of which also have parallels in other cultures. Indeed, one of the important tasks in the study of the Indus script is the isolation of vocabulary that is either peculiar or common to specific text categories. For example, a highly individual long inscription occurs only on two bronze weapons from Mohenjo-daro and as the first line of a seal found at the same site and area, though not in the same house (cf. Fig. 3). This association of the objects provides a clue to the meaning of their common inscription, which may indicate the owner of all three; another clue is the parallel of the inscribed axes from Ugarit, which suggests that these inscribed weapons might have been used in cultic ceremonies by a high priest.28 Seal texts have always and everywhere been fairly stereotyped and restricted in their contents. Particular attention should be paid to Sumerian parallels, since their cultural con text is largely similar to that of the Indus seals and because we know for certain from the seals with Indus script found in Mesopotamia29 that the Harappans had been in direct con tact with the Sumerians. At least the Near Eastern Indus seals can reasonably be supposed to follow a similar textual pattern, since even their non-Harappan round or cylindrical form testifies to the influence of foreign models. Two-thirds of the corpus of 300 Sumerian seal inscriptions from the late 3rd millennium b.c., published recently by D. O. Edzard (1968), are owner seals. They comprise either a proper name alone (thus in 62 instances), a proper name and/or occupation or title (106 instances), a proper name with a patronymic (26 instances), or a proper name with both occupation and a patronymic (28 instances). By far the most common of all occupations and titles in Edzard's seals is that of the scribe, which comprises about one quarter of the material, and it may be expected to hold a prominent position also in the Indus seals. Other occupations mentioned are different sorts of priests of particular gods and temples, various foremen, merchants, judges, policemen, cup-bearers, granary keepers, porters, builders, couriers, barbers, washermen, stone cutters, smiths, cooks, musicians, and so on. All urban occupations seem to be represented among the seal owners. Taking into account the fact that Indus seals have been found in almost every room of the city of Mohenjo-daro and on the streets, and the ratio between the number of seals found and the estimated population, it seems likely that every independent person carrying on a profession had a seal of his own. To judge from their worn condition and repairs, some seals were apparently used for generations, having probably been inherited together with an office, and may hence contain a title rather than a proper name.30 Even the size of the Indus seals seems to have a meaning, for large Indus seals have, as a rule, been carved much more carefully than the smaller ones, and it is the larger ones that bear the " cf.

In fact the iconography of some of these seals provides, as we have tried to show, a sort of bilingual to the accompanying inscription80 (cf. also ? 9). The archaeological context of the find-spot, too, may give important hints to the contents of a seal inscription; for instance, objects showing that the owner of the house in which a seal was recovered was engaged in a particular trade, may help in identifying an occupational title. The sealings impressed on wet clay, attached to wickerwork or jars, and preserved through accidental fire in a storehouse,31 prove beyond doubt that Indus seals were used in connexion with trade or tax administration to indicate the owner, receiver, or sender of the sealed wares, as in Mesopotamia at the same epoch. One such sealing has in fact been found in Mesopotamia (Umma).32 Very important evidence to this effect comes from Bahrain in the Persian Gulf, where Geoffrey Bibby has convincingly identified an ancient customs office. Seals of local type, and stone weights of the Harappan style were found in marked preponderance in the houses immediately next to the city gate, where a well and feeding trough served as a halting place for unloading pack animals. This indicates that the in coming and outgoing goods were weighed and stamped by customs authorities.33 In histori cal times, seals were used in India not only to stamp bales of goods but also to make tokens for the representatives of the seal owner.84 The relationship between the seal and its owner is emphasized also by its protective, amulet function, which motivated the accompanying iconography. This prophylactic purpose of the seals is demonstrated by Mesopotamian, Indian, and many other parallels, as well as the holes made for hanging them around the neck, or from the belt, and by the small cases35 that have been carved inside some of these seals, which can hardly have contained anything else but talismans. All this evidence com bines to suggest that the majority of the Indus seal inscriptions also indicate their owners. In the above-mentioned corpus of Mesopotamian seals contemporaneous with the Indus seals, about two-thirds are owners' seals. The rest consist almost exclusively of dedica cation seals, which have the following formula: the name of the priest-ruler or god addressed, with titles, preceded by a dative preposition; then the name of the seal owner, with titles; and at the end, either the words "your slave" or "your son", or the expression "has dedica ted" or "has made".36 In the later Indian seals, too, those which do not contain the name or title of an individual or an official, a government institution or a monastery, bear inscrip-* tions of a religious nature, often in the form of a formula, such as, for instance, namas tasmai, "obeisance to Him!"37 When the Indus inscriptions are divided into "words", they can be seen to comprise different "phrase" patterns. Fig. 4 illustrates three important types of Indus seal inscriptions in a simplified "skeleton" form, each with a few characteristic examples. The sign terminating type No. 1 is, with its over 1,200 occurrences, by far the most common sign of the script, and has by most students been considered to represent the oblique 80 cf.

Type No. 2, the ending of which has also been considered by many students as a grammatical element,39 might be a dedication on the analogy of Mesopotamian seal texts. On the basis of this hypothesis the element Y could represent a divinity to whom something is dedicated. Its occurrence as an element of the proper names in type No. 1 as well supports rather than vitiates this hypothesis, because theophoric elements form an essential part of proper names among many peoples. The element X could represent a common noun, so that we would have proper names of the type represented, for instance, by Sanskrit Agni svdmin, "He whose lord is god Agni", or Sumerian dUtu-ur-sagt "god Utu is a hero". These hypotheses seem to fit well the other contexts in which the relevant signs appear, too. I shall mention here only the fact that the combination of what we think are a god's name and a genitive suffix also occurs, indeed fairly often, but is then in almost every case followed by one or two further signs, which are to be interpreted as independent words on the grounds that some of them can alone make an entire inscription. In this kind of inscription, type No. 3, the element Z could stand for the denomination of a priest or temple. 6. In this way it is possible to form more or less likely conclusions about the contextual sphere of the Indus signs by analytic means, quite independently of their pictorial or phone tic form. Confirmation of the posited interpretation can be sought in the picture represented by the relevant pictogram. In the oldest writing systems a picture of a thing is used as an ideogram to stand for the object depicted, or concepts closely related to it. In the Indus script, for instance, the linear picture of a human being, which is very often found in the position of the element Z in our inscription type No. 3, probably stands for the concept of "man" or "human being". Anticipating our phonetic interpretation, we may note that in Dravidian languages the most widely-used word for "man", an or ?f9 also means "servant",40 which fits nicely into the context we have been discussing and the posited meaning of "priest".

This presupposes, however, firstly, that in addition also the picture represented by the respective pictogram can be identified. Unfortunately this can seldom be done with any certainty, because the Indus script is much more simplified and stereotyped than, for instance, the Egyptian or Hittite hieroglyphs. We still know all too little of the developmen tal stage of the script,44 when the pictograms may have been more concrete. The often mentioned changelessness of the script,45 which in a way is paralleled by the Egyptian monu mental script, is undoubtedly partly due to the use of writing materials other than clay (probably the traditional Indian palm leaves), but partly perhaps also to our ignorance of its beginnings. There is, however, some variation, as exemplified by the following three examples (cf. Fig. 6).46 The identification of allographs on the basis of contexts is important not only for the statistical and grammatical analysis of the script, but also for the determi nation of the pictorial meanings, for the interpretation proposed must of course fit all the variants.

Even the study of other ancient civilizations along with ethnography can provide important clues, particularly when no direct evidence has been preserved of utensils (e.g., wooden) that the Harappans must have used.

Such comparisons are useful also in showing that the same symbol can stand for different things, thereby suggesting various alternatives (cf. Fig. 9). 7. If the contextual and rebus meaning can be established for a sign, one still must be able to identify the language in which these two different meanings are linked by the phonetic similarity of the respective words. A decipherment in the proper sense of the word is possible only if a language, closely enough related to that underlying the script, is known from other sources.53 Egyptian ^^ Sumerian ^C Indus A Fig. By comparative analysis of the inscriptions it is possible to isolate grammatical ele ments and to draw some conclusions about the typological structure of the Harappan language. The investigations done so far are preliminary, but it seems sufficiently clear that inflexion works predominantly through suffixation, while prefixation is absent. Also, the number of suffixes seems to be limited, and they occur after many different signs. These features point to an agglutinative language, and of the languages known to have existed in India before 1000 b.c., only the Dravidian group belongs to this type. The word order, which in the Indus inscriptions appears to entail the attributive elements preceding the head word, is also shared by the Dravidian languages, but not for instance by Sumerian, though it is also an agglutinative language.54 This typological conclusion is supported by considerations of historical linguistics,55 and by' the archaeological evidence, which I have tried to correlate with the linguistic.56 I shall here mention only a few main issues. Burusaski and the Austro-Asiatic languages, which, like Dravidian, are pre-Aryan, are eliminated by considerations of their historical areal extension and external relations, which have good counterparts in the so-called Kashmir neolithic and the Eastern neolithic respectively. The excavations of the past few decades have shown indisputably that the Indus civilization is no Sumerian creation, as was once thought, but rias grown out of the local "Early Indus" cultures that had come to the Indus valley and Baluchistan a little before 3000 b.c., being ultimately of Turkmenian Origin.57 This derivation of the Early Indus and Harappan cultures is in agreement with the most widely-supported linguistic theory concerning the provenance and external relations of the Dravidian languages, namely that linking them through structural and lexical simi larities with the Ural-Altaic languages,58 The earlier languages that undoubtedly were spoken in the Indus valley are eliminated by the following consideration.

The archaeological sequences show that the new cul tures absorbed the earlier ones very quickly,40 and at least by the end of the millennium during which the Early Indus cultures and the Indus civilization dominated the Indus valley, they must have assimilated all previous linguistic substrata? Baluchistan and Afghanis tan, from which the Early Indus cultures descended the Indus valley, continued to belong to the Harappan sphere, as is shown by several Harappan settlements found in Baluchistan, such as Dabar Kot, Periano Ghundai, Gumla, and Rahman Dheri. A pre-Aryan language, though heavily influenced by the neighbouring Iranian and Indo-Aryan speeches, has sur vived to the present day in Baluchistan and south-eastern Afghanistan, namely, the Dravi dian Brahui, with about 400,000 speakers.61 Brahui shares several common innovations with Kurukh and Malto, Dravidian languages spoken in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, and Bengal.62 Having also words in common not known from the other Dravidian langua ges,68 they may be considered as remnants of a large North Dravidian dialect area, which was subsequently overlaid and assimilated by the Aryans. The extent and considerable duration that this North Dravidian unity presupposes, are well matched by the Harappan culture extending from Baluchistan to Alamgirpur in Uttar Pradesh, while, on the other hand, there seems to be no alternative. The linguistic evidence, suggesting that Central Dravidian was the first subgroup to separate from Proto-Dravidian,64 as well as its geographic extent, can best be correlated with the Central Indian culture characterized by the so-called Ochre Coloured Ware, which the latest excavations show to be approximately contemporaneous in its early phases with the Harappan civilization and of the same Early Indus derivation.65 Proto-South-Dravidian, again, is in all likelihood to be identified with the Deccan neolithic, rather than the megalithic culture of South India.66 The origin of the Deccan neolithic is still very problematic; although local mesolithic traditions undoubtedly formed the major element in it, some impulses were apparently received from the Indus valley.67 Minerals such as fuchsite, found at Mohenjo-daro, are clear evidence for Harappan trade contacts with South Lidia.68 The decline of the urban civilization of the Harappans did not mean the complete destruction of the entire population of the enormous area dominated by the Indus civiliza tion, but only the reduction of the culture to the village level.

It has been demonstrated by the archaeologists that many late Harappan traditions survived and continued in the succeeding chalcolithic cultures that were dominated by newcomers from Iran.6* Rg-Vedic Prakritisms and the dialectal divergences of classical Sanskrit from the Rg-Vedic language70 are linguistic evidence supporting the claim made by archaeologists that these new cultures, appearing from 2000 b.c. onwards, were Aryan.71 Much later, the hybrid cultures resulting from their fusion with the late Harappans were partly overlaid by the Vedic Aryans, generally correlated with the Painted Gray Ware of about 1100-500 b.c.72 Clear, extensive, and generally-accepted evidence for a pre-Aryan substrate influence upon the Rg-Vedic language (in all likelihood through the earlier Aryan languages of India) has been adduced only for Dravidian, which is very strong proof for a dominant position of this language group in the Panjab region some time before the late 2nd millennium b.c.78 These considerations receive support also from the Sumerian name of the Indus civiliza tion, Me-luh-ha, possibly Me-laji-fia in the documents of the Harappan period, which can be correlated with Pali milakkha and Sanskrit mleccha, both meaning "barbarian". A probable Dravidian etymology is supplied by the Old Tamil toponym Tamilakam "Tamil country", where the word akam "country" was pronounced already in Proto-Dravidian with a spirantized -k-.7A 8. The signs that are found most often in the place of the element Y of the typology of seal inscriptions presented above, and are presumed to represent names of divinities, consist of the picture of fish with or without added diacritics or stable adjunct signs. The pictorial interpretation of the basic sign as a fish cannot be questioned,75 because the iconography accompanying some inscriptions shows a similarly-drawn fish in the mouth of an alligator (cf. Fig. 10).76 Although the simple fish sign occurs side by side with short strokes that can be Fro. 10. demonstrated to be numerals,77 it is hardly possible that the majority o? the elaborately carved seals should record quantities of fish, even if fish played an important role in the Harappan economy.78 As a symbol of divinity the fish is not unknown-?we may recall the fish incarnation of Vi?nu?but a Dravidian homophone offers a decidedly more satisfactory cf. ibid., 149 and 180 ff.

The fish signs with different diacritic additions clearly stand for different things, for, with the exception of the simple fish sign (which is sometimes reduplicated so that it corres ponds to Tulu mini-mini "twinkling, glistening, dimly shining", Telugu mina-mina "glitter, shining"),80 one and the same fish sign is never repeated in any one inscription, but two or three different fish signs often occur beside each other.

The use of star names in proper names demands comparison with the general practice in India, at least as early as the time of the Buddha, of naming the child after the constellation under which it was born,98 and of carefully defining the position of the planets in the natal horoscope.99 Our thesis that the stars and especially the planets represent the Harappan gods, as implied by the theory of dedications and the theophoric elements of proper names, is supported by the independent parallel of the Meso-American civilizations, where the gods were connected with colours and the directions of space,100 as were the planets in India.101 "cf.

A passage of the Jaiminiya Grhyas?tra (2,9), however, expressly identifies them with the chief Hindu gods: the sun with ?iva, the moon with ?iva's spouse Um?, Mars with the wargod Skanda, Mercury with N?r?yana (Kr^na), Jupiter with Brahma, Venus with Indra (replacing apparently Balar?ma), Saturn with Yama (the god of death), and R?hu and Ketu with Yama*s messenger and scribe. It is also important to note that specific colours are associated with the chief Hindu divinities, thus gold with Brahma, white with Balar?ma, blue or green with Kr$na, red with Skanda; in fact some of their very names denote colours, as Rudra "red" and Kr$na "dark". The planet Jupiter is also usually called in Sanskrit Brhaspati, which is one of the variant names of god Brahma. The antiquity of planetary worship in India can also be demonstrated, though many scholars have asserted that the planets were not known to the Vedic Aryans.10* Yet the Vedic Aryans cannot have failed to observe the brightest stars of the sky, which, moreover, are distinguished by their motion, when using the naksatra calendar that is referred to a couple of times in the Rg-Veda.103 This scarcity of references to stars in general in the Ilg Veda contrasts remarkably with the full list of the lunar mansions in the Atharvaveda, which also mentions the planets (divicar? gr?h?h: 19,9,7 and 10). Together with the absence of the naksatra calendar from the Old Iranian records, this seems to indicate that the ?.g-Vedic Aryans adopted their calendrical astronomy first in India from the earlier inhabitants. The authorities nowadays generally agree that on the basis of the astronomical evidence, the 24th century b.c. is the most likely date of compilation for the naksatra calendar and the almost identical hsiu calendar of China.104 Both are based on the opposition of the sun and the full moon, and are entirely different in this respect from the Near Eastern solar calendars, which are heliacal.105 Their proposed Near Eastern derivation, therefore, seems very un likely.108 On the other hand, there was no urban civilization in China that would have needed a solar calendar in the 24th century b.c., while this date coincides with the peak of the Harappan civilization. The compilation of a solar calendar appears to have been an integral part of process of urbanization all over the ancient world,107 and it also seems to have been accompanied by the formation of a religion in which the cosmic orientation, the heavenly bodies, and cosmograms in the form of pyramids and zikkurats played a central role. This ideology is evidenced also in the Harappan cities: they are built in a grid pattern and care fully oriented according to the cardinal directions by astronomical means. As I have tried to show elsewhere, a basic pattern that seems to pervade all ancient Indian religious philoso phy can most naturally be understood as originating from such a Harappan background.108 9. In conclusion, I should like to discuss a sign that is not a picture of a fish, but whose inter pretation confirms the theory of a Harappan astral religion sketched above. It occurs very 101 cf.

The allographs prove that it represents a crab, sometimes shown as having feet too, but mostly occurring with claws only ; the empha sis is thus clearly on the claws (cf. Fig. 11). The picture could, therefore, well express the MV 3004 fiP 328? ^v ?v On (X* l25tim?

"planet", which also means "seiz ing", from the root ko\ "to grasp, seize, take".109 The Sanskrit word graha has exactly the same meanings, but it is in all likelihood a caique on the Dravidian term,110 which alone has a reasonable etymology for the meaning "planet" in the homophone kolfi "firebrand, glowing ember".111 Confirmation of the pictorial interpretation is found in Indian folklore. I quote the Baka-J?taka (No. 38): "You'd never be able to hold me tight enough, friend crane; whereas we crabs have got an astonishingly tight grip [the Pali word used, sugahanam, is derived from the same root as graha]... With his claws the crab gripped hold of the crane's neck, as with the pincers of a smith."112 In the Kakkata-J?taka (No. 267), a giant crab similarly catches an elephant's foot "tight in his claw, like a smith seizes a lump of iron in a huge pair of tongs".113 The interpretation receives, I think, very convincing confirmation from a ligature where the sign we are discussing appears to have been used as a phonetic indicator. This ligature occurs in the copper tablets, which need some description first. The inscriptions on the 200 copper tablets114 that have been found at Mohenjo-daro alone, differ from those of the seals in some important respects. As may be seen from Fig. 12, there are very many identical inscriptions (the numbers within the squares or rectangles repre senting the form of the tablets concerned indicate the number of duplicates). Besides, the inscriptions always correspond to a specific iconographie motif, normally an animal figure, carved on the reverse side of the tablet. This clear interd?pendance of the inscription and iconography, which is absent from the majority of the seals, provides an important key to the Indus script But the recent finds in the museums, which more than doubled the number of known copper tablets,115 have ameliorated these favourable conditions still more and have given us what I take to be virtual bilinguals. We now know many cases, confirmed by duplicates, where the iconographie figure on the reverse is replaced by a single pictograph, or in some cases by a combination of two signs, while the inscription on the obverse remains the same. The only explanation that I find natural is that in these cases the isolated picto grams on the reverses express the name of the divinity represented by the iconographie figure. " cf.

But we still have to explain the word k?fi as the name of the hunter-god armed with a bow. ?iva, the great god of Hinduism, who is generally considered to be largely of pre-Aryan origin, is often called Hara, which literally means "seizer", a meaning implied also by the epiphytic fig as a grasping plant. This name is used already in the ?aval?yana Grhyas?tra (4,8,19) of Siva's Vedic predecessor Rudra. Rudra already appears, in a statistically subordi nate position indicative of his intrusive nature in the Rg-Vedic pantheon, in our earliest text collection, which describes him as a cruel hunter, who with his characteristic weapon, the bow, shoots arrows of fever and disease on cattle and people.118 The words kb\, k?li, and kofli have yet more homophones widely attested in Dravidian, with meanings that must certainly have come to the minds of the early Dravidians using these very similarly pro nounced expressions. One is kof or k?j, which means "to hit, wound, kill" and is, at least in Telugu and Kolami, used with particular reference to shooting with a bow.119 The other is kof "sound of howling, wailing or roaring, the sound produced in lamentation and weeping".120 The name of Rudra has been connected etymologically with Sanskrit rudhira "(blood-)red; blood" and Greek i-pvBoos "red" by many scholars, but the exceptional Rudra instead of the expected *Rudhra has remained a difficulty.1211 suspect that it is due " cf.

Fig. 17).125 These masks were probably used in devil dances, which in later Indian reli Fio.117. gion are associated with the cult of Skanda, "the leaper", identified with the old Tamil war god Murukan "youth", who is also called Kulakan "youth", from the root kolu- "young, tender",128 and C?y?n "the Red one".127 In Indian medicine Skanda figures as a demon of sickness (graha), sucking infants' blood (cf. Skt. rudhira "blood").128 Skanda is also asso ciated with the red planet Mars, which is in Sanskrit called, among other names, rudhira. It is also important to note that a goat-faced hero called Vi??kha is said to have been born of Skanda's side.129 Vi??kha is one of the lunar mansions, the one opposite Krttik?, the 1M cf., e.g., Taittir?ya-Samhit?, 1,5,1,1 yadarodlt tadrudrasya rudratvam; similarly also ?atapatha-Brahmana, 6,1,3,10, etc. 1Mcf.

The deity Naigamesa is apparently the same as Nejamesa mentioned in the Khilas of the Rg-Veda as a son-granting deity (Chatterjee 1970,5 f.).</page><page sequence="25">202 TASKS, METHODS AND RESULTS IN THE STUDY OF THE INDUS SCRIPT asterism of the Pleiades presided over by Agni, in which Skanda (K?rttikeya) was born. The sun was apparently "born" in the Pleiades, marking the New Year (vernal equinox) in the earliest naksatra list. The sun is, however, also "born" every day, and indeed the red and beautiful young Skanda is in the texts compared with the red rising sun.130 Such mo ments as sunrise and sunset are critical moments, open to the attack of demons,131 and the Satapatha Br?hmana (4,6,5,1 ff.) connects the sickness-demon graha with the rising and setting sun. The "fire" of fever was understood to be caused by the arrows of the sickness god par excellence, Rudra, and they could well be thought to be represented by the rays of the rising (red) sun. Note also the Dravidian word k?li "cock",132 used in Tamil of the red cock of Murukan's flag,133 and noted in the literature for its cry at the sunrise. The name graha "seizer" applied to the planets, refers especially to the ominous planets Mars and Saturn, which are thought to be malignant demons who "seize" human beings with invisible slings of sickness.13* The principle of economy in the early writings suggests that the two signs discussed above were ligatured to indicate that the fig sign in this particular case only was to be read with a phonetic value similar to that of the word "seizing", kof, depicted by the sign of a crab's claws. Normally, however, the fig sign would have a different phonetic value. I should like to suggest that this normal value was vafa, denoting the "banyan tree, Ficus Indica", which is also among the meanings of the word k?li. It is true that the word vafa has hitherto generally been considered a Sanskrit word, but in my opinion there can be little doubt of its Dravidian etymology. In the first place, the banyan tree is native to India and does not grow in the regions where the Aryans came from (we may recall how the Greek ambassador Megasthenes, visiting India in 300 b.c., was astounded by the sight of this tree); consequently the word is not likely to have an origin outside India, and indeed no convincing Indo-European etymology has been offered. On the other hand, the genuine Dravidian word vata meaning "rope"135 offers a very convincing etymology, since air roots resembling ropes or cables are the banyan's most characteristic feature136. In Dravidian we have, moreover, an exact homophone with an entirely different meaning, "north, north ern".137 This pun does not exist in Sanskrit, yet the classical Hindu cosmology of the Pur?nas refers to vafa "banyan" as the tree of the northern direction.138 This old symbolic association must go back to a still earlier Dravidian linguistic context. The combination of the pictograms depicting (from right to left, as read) "fig" and "fish" respectively, giving the combination vafa-min "north star", actually attested in Tamil literature, occurs twice in the Harappan inscriptions (cf. Fig. 18). Vata-mtn refers to the star of faithfulness (Arundhati), pointed out to the bride in the South-Indian and Vedic marriage ceremony, like dhruva 130 cf.

Arundhati figures as the model of faithfulness also in the Mah?bh?rata; she is referred to in 1,196,14 as Jafil?, "wife of the seven sages as said in the Pur?na". The seven sages are the stars of the Great Bear, and ja\ila has a meaning not recorded in the dictionaries: "possessing aerial roots (jfl/a)".140 The Sanskrit word jaf?, again, has a Dravidian etymology in ca\ai "matted locks of hair, as worn by ascetics and Siva",141 ?Siva's hair being compared to the banyan tree. One of the chief combinations of the "fig" sign consists of four short strokes, certainly representing the number "four", followed by the fig sign.142 Since the number four is n?l in Dravidian,143 this compound should provide a test for the above theory. To my mind it does, for the Dravidian root n?l (with a palatal nasal, which in many Dravidian languages alter nates with, or is replaced by, dental nasal or zero)144 means "to hang, be suspended, swing" ; cf. also the Telugu derivative n?la "a hanging rope".145 We thus get a compound n?l-vafam, which may be understood as a bahuvrihi : "(the tree) which has hanging (??l) ropes (va/?/n)". This leads me to suggest that the above-mentioned root (?)?l (with ?- &gt; 0) may well be the etymology of the Dravidian word ?l (?la-maram) which means "banyan tree".146 The fact that two of the three inscriptions having this combination of the pictograms of "four" and "fig" show on the reverse side nothing but an isolated/?g leaf(c?. Fig. 19) also seems signi ficant in this context. H. y \$)?? ? ^ 3S62 ?^ ^ "" ??.
