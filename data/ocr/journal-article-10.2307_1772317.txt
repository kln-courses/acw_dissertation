<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE ROBERT ALTER Comparative Literature, Berkeley Perhaps the greatest peculiarity of biblical poetry among the litera- tures of the ancient Mediterranean world is its seeming avoidance of narrative. The Hebrew writers used verse for celebratory song, dirge, oracle, oratory, prophecy, reflective and didactic argument, liturgy, and often as a heightening or summarizing inset in the prose narra- tives - but only marginally and minimally to tell a tale. This absence of narrative is all the more striking against the background of the surrounding and antecedent literatures of the ancient Near East that have been uncovered by archeological research. To cite the most apposite example, the literature of the city of Ugarit, on the Medi- terranean coast of present-day Syria, written around 1300 B.C.E. in a language closely cognate to biblical Hebrew and according to the same general conventions of poetic parallelism, includes long verse narratives that have recognizably epic features: In an interplay of narration and dialogue, the formal burden of the poetry is the telling of a traditional tale; and the narrative tempo is leisurely enough to allow for detailed descriptions of feasts, hand-to-hand combat, even to some degree of the physical appearance of the actors, human and (for the most part) divine. There is nothing like this in the Hebrew Bible, and supposedly "epic" elements like the historical psalms (Ps. 78, 105, 106) are actually exceptions that confirm the rule, for they turn out to be versified summaries or catechistic rehearsals of Israelite history, with no narrative realization of the events invoked, their intelligi- bility dependent on the audience's detailed knowledge of the events. And even the rare biblical poems that have explicit narrative seg- ments, like the Song of the Reed Sea and the Song of Deborah, are not, strictly speaking, narrative poems, because they lack the defining feature of independent narrative - exposition - and instead respond to an event or set of events presumably already known to ?

Although it is not very likely that the biblical writers specifically knew the Ugaritic corpus, there are persuasive grounds for concluding that a good many of them were familiar with a now lost Canaanite literature to which Ugaritic essentially belongs: Biblical poetry repeats not only the system (of parallelism and dozens of actual word-pairings found in the Ugaritic, but also abounds in allusions to clements of the Canaanite-Ugaritic myths, and occasionally even borrows a whole line of verse from its pagan predecessors ("For lo, thine enemies, () Baal, for lo, thine enemies shall perish. .."). It may well be, as the Israeli biblical scholar Shemaryahu Talmon (1978:354) has suggested, that the biblical writers generally avoidcd verse narrative precisely because of its associations with pagan mythology. In considering the resourcefulness of prose in biblical narrative, I have had occasion to propose that there may have also been a positive attraction of the prose medium for the Hebrew teller of tales: the suppleness and subtlety of prose as it was handled by the biblical writers made possible a more nuanced and purposefully ambiguous representation of human character, liberated from the fixed roles, the hieratic and hyperbolic perspectives, of ancient Near Eastern verse narrative (Alter 1981:23-62). The perception, however, of this decisive shift of narration from poetry to prose should not lead us to conclude that biblical verse is chiefly a poetry of assertion and reassertion, "purified" of narrative elements. On the contrary, I would contend that the narrative impulse, for the most part withdrawn from the prominent structural and generic aspects of the poems, often resurfaces in their more minute articulations, from verset to verset within the line and from one line to the next. Recognizing the operation of such a narrative impulse in the poems may help us see their liveliness more fully, may help us understand the links in modes of expression between the typical non-narrative poems and the occasional poems with explicit narrative materials. Before looking at how these principles might work in the texts, let me briefly recapitulate the description I have proposed of semantic parallelism. Following Benjamin Hrushovski's (1971:1200-1202) cogent account of biblical prosody as a "free rhythm" in which, within fixed quantitative limits, there are shifting parallelisms of meaning, accentual stress, and syntax, with a coincidence of all three elements of parallelism always possible but by no means obligatory, I would observe that semantic parallelism, though sometimes actually avoided 1. I am indebted to Jack Sasson and Uriel Simon for sharpening my understanding of this point.</page><page sequence="3">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 617 by poets either locally, for reasons dictated by context, or even throughout a poem, remains a very prominent feature of most biblical verse. Prevalent notions of the second verset of a line as an "echoing" or "variant" of the first verset involve several difficulties, one of which is a failure to explain how the poet in his series of allegedly synonymous, end-stopped utterances, develops the momentum to move from line to line - how, in other words, the poem has a structure which is more than a jerky progression from one repetition to the next. If, however, one recognizes that the semantic orientation of the system of apparent repetitions - let us say, cautiously, in two thirds of the cases - is toward a focusing, a heightening, a concretization, a development of meaning, it is possible to see that movement generated between versets is then carried on from line to line into the structure of the poem. In a preliminary way, I would propose that there are two fundamental kinds of structure in biblical poems, both of them following from what happens between versets within the line. On the one hand, one frequently encounters, especially in the Prophets and in Job, a structure of intensification, a sort of crescendo development, in which certain images and ideas introduced in the first parallel versets - they often may be binary oppositions - are stepped up from line to line and brought to a certain climax. On the other hand, a good many poems are worked out through a consequentiality of images and ideas that is incipiently narrative and may include brief sequences of explicit narrative development. In order to establish a broader and more shaded picture of the variety and interplay of semantic relations between versets, I would like to quote in full one relatively lengthy biblical poem, David's thanksgiving or victory hymn. Of course, no single poem in a variegated corpus can be entirely typical, but I have chosen this text in particular because it is not stylistically one-sided in its handling of semantic parallelism and illustrates a range of possibilities in its use of the convention. The poem is duplicated, with certain prominent textual variants, between Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22, but though the version in Psalms offers at least a couple of attractive readings at difficult junctures, it is somewhat less compact than the version in 2 Samuel, containing certain elements that look suspiciously like glosses, and so I will translate from 2 Samuel 22 as the more likely candidate for an authentic text. I shall use the following typographical symbols to make efficiently clear the shifting semantic relations between versets: = synonymity; @ synonymity with verbatim repetition; [ ] complementarity; &gt; focusing, heightening, intensification, specification; - consequentiality. "Consequential- ity," I am aware, is a concept that requires some explaining, but that</page><page sequence="4">618 ROBERT ALTER will be the burden of much of my general analysis of the movement from line to story. In just a few instances, I have superimposed two symbols, and of course there is no reason why a semantic relation cannot be partly one thing and partly another. In one case, I have left a question mark because the relation between versets did not seem to me decidable, perhaps as a result of a philological problem in the line. Since our concern here is with poetic lines, the numera- tion I offer is according to lines and does not reflect the traditional verse-numbers, there being 51 verses in the accepted division of this chapter but 53 lines of poetry as I scan them. 1 The Lord is my crag and my fortress = and my deliverer. 2 God my rock where I shelter, = my shield, my saving horn. 3 My stronghold and my refuge, &gt; my savior, who saves me from havoc. 4 Praised I called the Lord, -+and from my enemies I was saved. 5 For the breakers of death washed round me, &gt; the torrents of the underworld terrified me 6 The snares of the Pit encircled me, = the traps of death sprung on me. 7 In my strait I called to the Lord, O to my God I called. 8 From His abode He heard my voice, &gt; my cry in His ears. 9 The earth heaved and shuddered, [ ] heaven's foundations shook, they heaved, for Hie was incensed. 10 Smoke went up from His nostrils, -* consuming fire from His mouth, coals blazed forth from Him. 11 He bent the heavens, came down, - dense mist beneath his feet. 12 Mounted a cherub and flew, -+ soared on the wings of the wind. 13 Set darkness pavillions around Him, &gt; a massing of waters, looming thunderheads. 14 From the brilliance before Him -+ fiery coals blazed. 15 The Lord thundered from heaven, &lt;- the Most High sent forth His voice. 16 He let loose arrows and scattered them, &gt; lightning, and routed them. 17 The channels of the sea were exposed, [&gt;] the world's foundations laid bare. 18 From the Lord's roaring, &gt; the blast of His nostrils' breath. 19 He reached from on high and took me, &gt; He pulled me out of the mighty waters. 20 He rescued me from my strong enemy, &gt; from my foes who were too much for me. 21 They overtook me on the day of my disaster, ~ but God was my support. 22 He set me out in an open place, &gt; He freed me for He was pleased with me. 23 The Lord dealt with me by my merit, &gt; the cleanness of my hands He requited. 24 For I kept the ways of the Lord, &gt; I did no evil before my God. 25 All His statutes are before me, &gt; I swerved not from His laws. 26 I was blameless before Him, &gt; and kept myself from sin. 27 He requited me by my merit, &gt; my cleanness in His eyes. 28 With the loyal You deal loyally, [ ] with the blameless warrior, blamelessly. 29 With the pure You deal purely, [ ] with the perverse, deviously. 30 A lowly people You save, [ ] on the haughty Your eyes look down.</page><page sequence="5">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 619 31 You are my lamp, O Lord, &gt; the Lord lights up my darkness. 32 With You I rush a barrier, [ ] with my God I vault a wall. 33 God's way is blameless, -* the Lord's word pure, - He is a shield to those who shelter in Him. 34 For who is god beside the Lord, = who a rock beside our God? 35 The God, my mighty stronghold, -* Who kept my way blameless, 36 Made my legs like a gazelle's, -* and stood me on the heights. 37 Taught my hands combat, &gt;made my arms bend a bow of bronze. 38 You gave me Your saving shield, ?

Translation inevitably presupposes interpretation, but I have tried to minimize the tendency to doctor the evidence by hewing as close as possible to the actual idioms and the lexical values of the original, even to the point of awkwardness. Like many biblical poems, and in consonance with the regular practice of the prose-writers, David's victory hymn uses certain reiterated Leitwbirter as focal points for its thematic argument. The most important is "saving" or "salvation" - yesh'a - which is even sardonically punned on in line 44: yish'u ve'ein moshi'a ("they looked - there was none to save them"). With this in mind, I have kept the same English equivalent for the same Hebrew root throughout, again at the cost of some awkwardness. There are, to be sure, certain philological problems in the poem, and *Here and henceforth this symbol indicates a philological obscurity or possible textual difficulty in the Hebrew.</page><page sequence="6">620 ROBERT ALTER specialists may debate some of my construals, but I do not think such problems are extensive enough to affect the generalizations about the poetics of these lines which I would now like to propose. The poem is long enough so that a statistical breakdown of the varieties of semantic relation between versets may be instructive. In fact, the proportions here are fairly typical of the corpus of biblical poetry. In 36 of the 53 lines there is a clear element of dynamic movement from the first verset to the second: in 19 lines this involves some sort of intensification or specification; in another 17 lines, some relation of consequentiality. Twelve lines reflect a relatively static relation between versets - six of these through the deployment of synonyms, the other six through the bracketing of complementary terms, which may be similar in meaning, as in line 28, or antithetical pairs, as in lines 29 and 30. The five lines not yet accounted for include the philologically problematic line 38 and four lines where the semantic modification from verset to verset is weak enough to leave some doubt as to whether the line should be thought of as static or dynamic. The triadic line 51, for example, lists three overlapping and perhaps virtually synonymous actions of deliverance; but it is also possible to infer a developmental or intensi- fying sequence: first He frees me, then He lifts me up over my enemies, and what is more, He saves me from wreakers of havoc. In any event, it is hardly necessary to insist on such borderline cases in order to preserve the clear statistical preponderance of dynamic over static lines, here and elsewhere in biblical poetry. We might note, moreover, that of the eight essentially synonymous lines here (adding two now from the ambiguous column), two occur at the very beginning and three at the very end of the poem, leading one to suspect that the poet particularly reserved this paradigmatic form of static parallelism for the purposes of framing, while parallelism in the body of the poem is preponderantly dynamic. Turning to the dynamic lines of the poem, let me rapidly indicate the typical maneuvers through which intensification or focusing is effected, and then we can go on to the relation I have labeled consequentiality, which will have more direct implications for the presence of narrative elements in this and other biblical poems. The simplest strategy of intensification is the introduction in the second verset of one parallel term that is obviously stronger than its counter- part in the first verset, as in line 5, where the breakers of death merely "wash round" (or "encompass") while the parallel torrents of the underworld "terrify." Specification of place, action, agency, and cause in the second verset achieves a similar effect, as in line 19: "He reached from on high and took me,/ He pulled me out of the mighty waters." There is a kinship between such lines and the sort of</page><page sequence="7">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 621 development that occurs in incremental repetition, as one can see by comparing with the line just quoted the triadic line 9, where, after a complementary link between the first verset and the second, there is incremental repetition between the first verset and the third: "The earth heaved and shuddered,/ heaven's foundations shook,/ they heaved for He was incensed." The departure from syntactic parallel- ism while.parallelism of meaning is preserved (as in the subordinate clause of the last verset just cited) can be a means of adding to or at least heightening meaning. One of the most common patterns in this regard is for the poet to place nouns or a nominal phrase in the first verset and make them more active through verbal development in the second verset, as in line 3: "My stronghold and my refuge,/ my savior, Who saves me from havoc." Or again, in line 31: "You are my lamp, O Lord,/ the Lord lights up my darkness." A general term in the first verset may become more specific and/or more concrete in the second verset, whether as a verbal transforma- tion of a noun or as a matched noun. Thus, in line 50: "The God who grants me vindication,/ and lays low peoples before me." Or, less conspicuously, in line 23: "The Lord dealt with me by my merit,/ the cleanness of my hands He requited." Another variation of this pattern appears in lines 24-26, where all the first versets affirm generally that the speaker has been faithful to God's laws while the second versets stipulate that he has actually avoided evil. (Such rhetorical bracketing of x and not-the-opposite-of-x, which is fairly common in biblical poetry, is, approximately, a strategy for creating ad hoc synonyms, but it usually involves some element of specifi- cation or activation of the initial term, as our example illustrates.) More impressively, the focusing of an idea can also become the focusing of an image, as in line 8 - "From His abode He heard my voice,/ my cry in His ears" - or the awesome effect of line 18: "From the Lord's roaring,/ the blast of His nostrils' breath." Focusing an image can also involve a hyperbolic stepping-up of the idea, as in line 37: "Taught my hands combat,/ made my arms bend a bow of bronze." Finally, if, as I have intimated, many of the maneuvers of intensification ultimately derive from an archaic matrix of incremental repetition, it is not surprising that we should find lines where the heightening of meaning is achieved through an appositional elaboration or piling-on of associated images or acts, as in line 13 - "Set darkness pavillions around Him,/ a massing of waters, looming thunderheads" - and line 45: "I crushed them like the dust of the earth,/ like street mud I ground them, trampled them." There is a single line in our poem that would seem to be one of those very rare instances in biblical verse which run directly counter</page><page sequence="8">622 ROBE R'[ ALTER to the principle of semantic dcvelopmcnt from first verset to second: "The Lord thundered from heaven,/ the Most High sent forth Hlis voice" (line 15). "Thundered" is obviotusly the stronger as well as the more specific term, "sent forth Ifis voice" the weaker and the more general one. There is a reason, however, for this reversal which will lead us into the issue of consequentiality. I would assume that thunder precedes the voice of' the Lord because that is the way it was experientially for the ancient Near Eastern imagination: first the awestruck observer heard the peal of thunder, then he realized that God must be speaking. In rhetorical terms, the relation between the two utterances is between the vehicle and the tenor of a metaphor, but in logical terms, which may be more strictly relevant for the biblical imagination of the natural world, it is a relation of effect and cause. Repeatedly we will find that an utterance in the second verset, whether or not it is parallel in meaning to the first verset, occurs there because it follows from the initial utterance, either in our human perception of the phenomenon invoked or, far more frequently, as an objective event in a chain of events. This is perhaps most obvious when there is no semantic parallelism, as in line 4: "Praised I called the Lord,/ and from my enemies I was saved." The relation between the two statements is one of both narrative sequence and cause and effect. First, the speaker, presumably in straits, praised God and/or called upon Him in supplication (the Hebrew syntax is somewhat ambiguous), and then, in vindication of this faith and in response to this prayer, God rescued him from his enemies. Even where an ear lulled by the illusion of synonymity might pick up nothing but a series of equivalent images, there often proves to be sequential movement in time and consequential move- ment in a chain of causality. In our text, the extraordinary passage describing the Lord's descent, amidst cosmic fireworks, to scatter His enemies, provides the most powerful case in point. Let me quote again for analysis three central lines of this segment, 10-12. Smoke went up from His nostrils, consuming fire from His mouth, coals blazed forth from Him. He bent the sky, came down, dense mist beneath His feet. Mounted a cherub and flew, soared on the wings of the wind. Since the first of these lines is triadic, we might pause a moment to note the function of triadic lines in a system of versification that is predominantly dyadic. One can think of approximate analogies in other prosodic systems, such as the occasional use of a triplet amidst heroic couplets in English Augustan verse. In that instance, however, the practice was rare and a purist like Pope considered it bad form, whereas in biblical verse many poets move back and forth</page><page sequence="9">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 623 freely between two-verset and three-verset lines. In some of the relatively long poems, like this one, triadic lines appear to have been used with purposeful selectiveness to mark some special emphasis or to indicate the beginning or conclusion of a segment within the poem (compare the placement of lines 9 and 10, 33, and 51). The triadic lines 9 ("The earth heaved. . .") and 10 begin the great sweeping movement of cosmic upheaval in which God is carried from His heavenly abode (line 8) down to the scrimmage of the battlefield (line 16). The earthquake imagery of line 9 leads metony- mically - from the poet's viewpoint, from effect to cause - to the volcanic depiction of the Deity in the first of the three lines quoted above. The. link between versets in line 10 is not a simple bracketing of conventionally associated complementary terms, as we have in the previous line. That is, "earth" and "heaven" or (line 16) "sea" and "world" are parts, even halves, that make a whole, whereas the series smoke-in-the-nostrils, fire-in-the-mouth, blazing-coals-all- around is a more dynamic progression. To begin with, the series presents a paradigmatic instance of intensification (smoke &gt; fire &gt; blazing coals). More important for what will follow in the poem, the series embodies a powerful sense of process: the smoke rises, then consuming fire leaps out, then there is a terrific incandescence all before the Lord as He prepares to come down to do battle. The forward rush of process may be even more evident when semantic parallelism is abandoned, as in line 14, which depicts divine incandescence in similar language but is shaped on the causal movement from a prepositional phrase in the first verset to the main clause in the second verset: "From the brilliance before Him/ fiery coals blazed." Something similar happens in the second of our three lines ("He bent the heavens, came down,/ dense mist beneath His feet."), where the second verset is no longer a semantic parallel to the first but an adverbial modifier of it that quite beautifully carries our eye downward with God's descent toward earth. The flight earthward is then dramatically realized in the next line, as God mounts his battle-steed and swoops down toward the fray. (Modem readers should be warned that the biblical cherub, keruv, is not the dimpled darling of Renaissance iconography but a celestial winged beast, majestic and probably rather fierce in aspect.) I have cheated slightly at this one point by adopting the more plausible reading of Psalm 18, "soared," rather than the 2 Samuel 22 text, which says "was seen" (a difference of just two barely distinguishable letters in the Hebrew), but even if one uses the reading from 2 Samuel, the narrative movement between versets remains clear: first God mounts His cherub and takes off, then He soars, or is seen, on the wings of the wind. These two versets are, I would suggest, not alternative</page><page sequence="10">624 ROBERT ALTER images but equivalencies, the cherub conceived figuratively by the poet as a representation of the wind. ('The Hebrew imagination, we might note, was unabashedly anthropomorphic but by no means foolishly literalist.) The last comment I would like to make on these three lines is about the way they at once overlap and move forward - a pattern thoroughly characteristic of narrative in biblical poetry. Elsewhere I have had occasion to note the frequency of interlinear semantic paral- lelism. There are vestiges of that here as well, as between lines 11 and 12, where there is first a general account of God's descent, then a more specific depiction of downward flight. But the most essential relation of the lines to each other (to look now over the whole sequence from 9 to 18) is as a series of'linked events following one another in time: the earth heaves; God glows with fire (an action "cued" by the final clause of line 9, "for He was incensed," the Hebrew verb for anger here clearly suggesting heat); He tips down the sky and descends; He soars earthward; He surrounds himself with ominous clouds; burning fiercely within them, He hurls His thunder- bolts and scatters the enemy; and, finally, in the closure of an envelope structure that takes us back to the seismic beginning in lines 9-10, the seabed and the earth's foundations are laid bare by His fiery breath. In all this, it is important to recognize the underlying connection between the movement within the line, from one verset to the next, and the movement from one line to the next. At first thought, semantic parallelism would seem to be preeminently an operation along what Roman Jakobson calls the paradigmatic axis, or axis of selection, of language. That is, the poet introduces a particular term, like "orphan," in his first verset, then he selects another term, like "widow," from the same general category for the second verset, or more synonymously, having invoked "voice" in the first verset, he chooses a counterpart like "utterance" from the same linguistic paradigm for the second verset. But the evidence we have reviewed ought to suggest that this is a very incomplete and misleading description of what actually goes on in biblical parallelism. In point of fact, the links between versets are often what Jakobson would call syntagmatic - that is, proceeding along the axis of contiguity, which is transformed by the poet into actual concatenation - rather than the axis of selection. Or perhaps it would be better to put aside the Jakobsonian imagery of axes, with its suggestion of movements set at right angles to each other, for what we very frequently find in biblical verse is the emergence of the syntagmatic from the para- digmatic: As the poet offers an approximate equivalent for an image or idea he has just invoked, he also begins, by the very logic of</page><page sequence="11">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 625 specification or intensification of the system in which he works, to push the initial image or idea into action, moving from one image to another that is temporally subsequent to and implied by the first. Narrativity, in other words, asserts itself at the heart of synonymity. If the second verset, as I have argued, is very often a spatial, experiential, or thematic focusing of the first verset, it can also be a focusing in a temporal chain, where initial and rather general actions lead to sharper or more extreme or more dramatically vivid consequences. (At least to the observing eye, causes tend to seem less concrete and particular than their effects.) In many instances, such syntagmatic links are confined within the line to the two or three versets; in many other cases, as in the one we have just examined from 2 Samuel 22, the incipiently narrative momentum within the line is carried over from one line to the next and becomes the propelling force for a small-scale narrative within the poem. Before attempting to follow the workings of this principle in verse narrative proper, I should like to offer a few examples in single lines of the pronounced general orientation of biblical poetry toward a focusing that is at once thematic and temporal. To begin with, when a line brackets two non-simultaneous actions, even where there is no difference in intensity or specificity between them, the chronologically later action will appear in the second verset, as in Ps. 22:10 - "You drew me out of the womb,/ made me safe on my mother's breasts" - or Ps. 100:4, where we have two subsequent stages of the same action: "Enter His gates in acclamation,/ His courts in praise." Often, the movement from general to specific is also at least implicitly a movement in temporal sequence, as in Prov. 1:16: "Their feet run to evil,/ they hurry to shed blood." Bloodshed is of course a specific and extreme instance of the general category, evil, but the line also intimates sequentiality: they go running to do evil and end up shedding blood. Temporal sequence is more explicit in a common pattern where a single verb in the first verset is followed by a small chain of verbs in the second verset which develop the initial action. Thus Is. 26:17: "As a pregnant woman draws near to give birth,/ she shudders, she screams in her pangs." Here the second verset conspicuously focuses the first verset, but at the same time it follows it: first the woman's time draws near, then we see her writhing in labor. A similar development is observable in Jer. 46:10: "The sword shall consume,/ shall be sated and drunk from their blood." Or again, in Is. 28:13: "But they shall trip backward,/ shall be broken, ensnared, and entrapped." Another common configuration of sequentiality is a movement from cause to effect, which is necessarily also a temporal movement and hence implicitly narrative, as in this line from Jacob's blessing</page><page sequence="12">626 ROBERT ALTER (Gen. 49:17) - "Hie bites the horse's hooves/ and its rider falls back" - or in the image of fire that plays across two lines in Is. 1:31: "The mighty tree2 shail turn to tow,/ its attendant a spark.// And the two shall burn together/ with none to extinguish." The swerve away from semantic parallelism in the last verset here in order to follow the curve of "plot" is a characteristic procedure that reflects how narrative momentum can begin to take over in the articulation of a rhetorical figure. One sees the same pattern in this triadic line from Ps. 11:2: "For look, the evil bend their bow,/ string their arrow,/ to shoot from the gloom at the upright." I should like to stress that in all these instances, as well as in the next two we shall go on to consider, what the poets give us is not narrative but narrativity - which is to say, the narrative development of metaphor. One might even apply that characterization to David's victory hymn, where, despite the strong narrative indications of the closely sequenced verbs in the perfect tense (as in biblical prose narratives), the anthropomorphic "plot" of God's descent to do battle is, ultimately, a metaphor for His sustaining power, not an account of an event that literally took place. As these small-scale examples may suggest, narrative movement forward in time is typically generated by establishing a series of linked actions which, according to the poetics of parallelism, are approximate equivalents but which prove to be, on closer inspection, logically discriminated actions that lead imperceptibly from one to the next. A sense of temporal progression is thus produced in a manner analogous to the illusion of movement created in the cinema, where a series of still photographs flashes on the retina with sufficient speed so that one seems to flow into the next, each frozen moment in the visual sequence fusing into temporal flux. A slightly longer passage will be necessary to illustrate how this principle works. Here is Job (16:9-15), in the midst of one of his harrowing protestations of anguish, recounting his tale of woe, which even without the expository and concluding verses I have omitted, is clearly a tale with a beginning, a development, and a climax: His anger rent and pursued me. He gnashed his teeth against me. My foe stabbed me with his eyes. They opened their mouths wide against me. In scorn they struck my cheeks. They were inflamed against me. God gave me over to the wicked. In the hands of the evil He thrust me. I was untroubled and He broke me. He smashed me, set me up as a target. 2. Others, ignoring the immediate context, render this as "stored treasure."</page><page sequence="13">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 627 His archers surrounded me, lie pierced my kidneys mercilessly, spilled to the ground my bile. lie breached me, breach upon breach, rushed at me like a warrior. Formally, one might describe these lines as a continuous series of' interlinear semantic parallelisms, one image of assault piled onto another, with a unifying metaphor of tearing or rupture: in the first line here, God "rends" - taraf - the verb used for the ravening action of beasts of prey; He goes on to stab, pierce, break, smash, and in the last line "breaches me, breach upon breach." The logic of the parallelism, then, is preeminently the logic of intensification we have observed in so many other biblical texts, but it is important to note that the process of intensification here is projected onto a temporal axis, which is to say that it becomes narrative - or, to be more precise, it is the narrative development of a metaphor (God as implacable assailant). First we have the hostile approach of the wrathful God, gnashing His teeth, glaring from a distance. Then He lets loose His baleful emissaries of destruction, who threaten Job, strike him, seize him, make him a target for their arrows, finally reduce him to a mass of gaping wounds. The analogy I have proposed with the cinematic illusion of movement, through a sequencing of overlapping stills may be helpful because it suggests that this is, remarkably, a mode of narrative report that works essentially without recourse to summary. The biblical prose narratives, by contrast, constantly make use of the boldest summaries, alternately speeding up narrative tempo through summary and slowing it down (usually, through extended dialogue), and thus convey a sense of controlled uneven jumps in time which help embody the narrator's subtle interpretive perspective on his own materials. The verse narrative, on the other hand, is a sort of past continuous - with the ambiguity of the Hebrew verbs even allowing construal as a virtual present tense - in which the sequence of overlapping actions catches us up experientially in the reported events, leaving no space for an obtrusively manipulative narrator to stop the action, change its pace, or summarize a whole temporal segment. I do not mean to suggest that what I have just described is in this precise form the invariable narrative strategy one encounters in biblical verse, though I do think it is instructively typical. Obviously, any poet will to some extent adapt his intimation of temporal progression to the particular kind of process or action he is repre- senting. In the tremendous evocation of the Day of the Lord at the beginning of Joel 2, the poet is much more interested in imparting the rhythm of an inexorable march to his description of the advancing enemy army, and to that end he takes advantage of certain expressive possibilities of formal repetition. The whole powerfully</page><page sequence="14">628 ROBERT ALTER interlinked passage has to be seen (again, the numeration reflects my line divisions, not the traditional verse numbers): 1 Blast a horn in Zion, sound the alarm on My holy mount. 2 Quake all who live on the earth, for the Day of the Lord has come, is close. 3 Day of darkness and gloom, day of cloud and dense mist 4 Like soot spread out on the mountains, a vast immense people. 5 It's like there never was and never will be again to years without end. 6 Before it consuming fire and after it blazing flame. 7 Like the Garden of Eden before it, after it desolate waste, nothing escapes it. 8 Like the look of horses their look, like steeds they run. 9 Like the sound of chariots on hilltops they dance, like the sound of fiery flame consuming straw, a vast people arrayed for battle. 10 Before it peoples tremble, every face turns ashen.* 11 Like warriors they run, like fighters they scale a wall. 12 Each man on his own track goes, they swerve* not from their course 13 No man jostles his fellow, each goes on his own path, though they fall through a loophole, they are unscathed.* 14 Through the city they swarm, they run to the wall. 15 They scale the houses, come in at the windows like thieves. 16 Before them the earth quakes, heaven shakes. 17 Sun and moon grow dark, the stars pull in their brightness. 18 And the Lord sounds His voice before His army, His camp is immense, vast are his agents. 19 For great is the Day of the Lord, very awesome - who can endure it? This poem does impressively convey through its parade of "parallel" actions a sense of forward movement in time, but the narration is formally framed and formally punctuated by a deploy- ment of symmetrical repetition not observable in the passage from Job we looked at. Lines 1-4, which introduce the Day of the Lord, are beautifully mirrored, image for image and even word for word, by the formal conclusion in lines 16-19. At the beginning, the warning trumpet is sounded; at the end, the Lord sends forth His voice. At the beginning, those who dwell on the earth quake; at the end, the earth itself quakes, and heaven as well. The darkness and gloom of the opening lines become a cosmic darkness at the end (line 17), and the epithets "vast" and "immense" for the destroying army introduced at the beginning are reiterated at the end, as is, of course, the key term, "Day of the Lord." But what of temporal progression in the poem? Initially, the invading army is seen as ominously inert, "spread out" like soot</page><page sequence="15">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 629 (or, if one prefers the more conventional interpretation of this word, oxymoronically, like dawn) on the mountains, with no verb directly attached to it. The poet allows us at first to see not so much the army as its effects - consuming fire before and behind it, weirdly counterpointing the deep darkness that the enemy exudes. The first two versets of line 7 are a brilliant exploitation of the possibilities of surprise inherent in the system of parallelisms. Expecting a comple- mentary or synonymous utterance to follow "the Garden of Eden" - as in the "before it/ after it" pairing of the preceding line - we are shocked by the image of devastation, and thus made witnesses to the army's annihilating advance without the action itself being directly narrated. The poet exercises a stark economy in both his figurative language and in his choice of vocabulary. Apart from the reiterated image of consuming fire (to which shahar of line 4, whether it means "soot" or "dawn," would be associatively linked), all the similes for the army turn out to be metonymies intimately bound to the actual army or in fact literal designations rhetorically masquerading as similes. The troops are like horses, which at least some of them presumably would be riding; they run like warriors and fighters, which is what they are. More relevant to the issue of narrative is what happens with the verbs. The first verb for the movement of the invaders - "run" - is not introduced until the end of line 8. Then we have an overlap from "run" to "dance," followed by a repetition of "run," which moves on to "scale," then "go" repeated in two successive lines, then the addition of the vivid "swarm," followed by another occur- rence of "scale" and "run," and, finally, "come in." (In this reca- pitulation, I have omitted verbs that have a subject other than the army and also the verbs in lines 12-13 which indicate not the invaders' forward movement but the fact that they make no lateral movements.) This sequence of verbs is, of course, a pattern of over- lapping actions, but a more pointed way of describing it would be to say it reverts far more directly than is common to what I have called the matrix of incremental repetition of biblical verse. The poet here is less interested in an illusion of seamless temporal pro- gression than in a steady solemn advance - spatially, from the distant mountains up to and over the walls of the city and into the houses - marked by a mounting drumbeat, and for this the model of incremental repetition is particularly apt: they run, they dance, they run, they scale a wall, they go, indeed, they go, they swarm, they run, they scale, they come in at the windows like thieves. A narrative tempo like this brings us close to the mesmerizing rhythms of the Song of Deborah, to which it now behooves us to turn. The Song of Deborah is too long to be analyzed here in its</page><page sequence="16">630 ROIBI1RT AL'T'I R cntirety, but the remarkable concluding section (jud. 5:"24-31), which recounts the Canaanite general Sisera's death at the tun- flinching hands of Jacl, is in itself an illuminating instance o* the artistic possibilities of I lebrcw verse narrative, and is all the more instructive because the way it shapes its materials can bhe hanOily compared with the prose v5ersion of the same events that prccedes the Song. Here is the complete passage, to the very end of the ,,poem, again with local line numeration rather than verse numbers: I Blessed above women be Jacl, wife of Hleber the Kenite, above women in tents be she blessed. 2 Water he asked, milk she gave, in a princely bowl she brought him curds. 3 Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. 4 She hammered Sisera, cracked his head, smashed and pierced his temple. 5 Between her legs he kneeled, fell, lay, between her legs he kneeled and fell, where he kneeled, he fell, destroyed. 6 Through the window she looked and whined/ Sisera's mother, through the lattice. 7 "Why is his chariot so long in coming, why so late the clatter of his cars?" 8 The wisest of her ladies answer, and she, too, replies on her own: 9 "Will they not find and divide the spoil? a damsel or two for every man? 10 Spoil of dyed stuff for Sisera, spoil of embroidered dyed stuff, embroidered dyed pairs for each neck as spoil?" 11 Thus perish all Your enemies, O Lord! Be His friends like the sun rising in might. No text could make more beautifully clear how far from auto- matic formulas are both the literal repetitions and the synonymous substitutions of biblical poetry. The passage begins with a formal introduction that blesses Jael, to be matched at the very end of the poem by the line that symmetrically distributes a curse to God's enemies, blessing to His friends. The middle verset of the triadic line 1, following the convention for names in parallelism, substitutes a relational epithet, "wife of Heber the Kenite," but it is a themati- cally pointed substitution, for it reminds us that this heroine, who is not even an Israelite but the member of a clan loosely allied to Israel but also friendly to Sisera's king, was the one who struck the final blow in a war in which several of the tribes of Israel had failed to rally to the cause. The third verset of line 1 is an incremental repetition of the first, but the seemingly innocuous and automatic increment, "in tents," is crucially significant for what follows - first, because of Jael's exceptional departure from the pacific, domestic</page><page sequence="17">IROM()I LINEI'() STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 631 r(ole o, tcnt-(Iwelling women, and, then, because the tent will be the scene of Jacl's killing ot Sisera, the tent peg and hammer the con- Venient \veapl)ns she seizes. The relatin Ibetween versets in the second line is an instance of that combined imagistic and temporal focusing we have observed elsewhere. Asked for water by the battle-weary fugitive, Jael gives, or of'leCrs, milk, which is then hyperbolically elaborated as "curds" at the end o the line. But the increment of "in a princely bowl" in the second versct olfers us a concrete dramatic image that follows chronologically from the general proffering of milk in the first vcrset, and even more particularly, it directs our attention toward Jael's hands bearing the bowl and thus becomes an implicit overlap to the next line: "Hler hand reached out for the tent peg . . ." What is cllided through this brilliant transition, though it is assumed, is the prose version's account of Sisera going to sleep after drinking the curds (we will consider this difference between the two renderings of the story presently). In consonance, that is, with both the prin- ciple of incremental repetition and that of closely sequenced inter- related pictures, each line of narration picks up something from the preceding line and somehow pushes it further, and so here the hands that would necessarily be bearing the princely bowl are immediately seen reaching for the deadly implements. A separate report of Sisera's sleep is not allowed to intervene, though the audience would surely have presupposed that narrative datum, and without it Jael would scarcely have had the chance to pick up peg and hammer and strike the blow. (For her to use both these instrumenrts, her victim would have had to lie quite still.) In general, the elliptical nature of the narrative - Sisera is not even mentioned by name here until the fourth line - reflect-s that lack of exposition I referred to earlier in Hebrew narrative verse, its ancillary relation to a pre- established story. "Hand"/"right hand" (yad/yamin), in that order, make a fixed word-pair that goes back to the Ugaritic, but whereas yad else- where usually means the same thing as yamin, here the poet takes advantage of the fact that parallel versets can be complementary rather than synonymous, making yad in this case refer to the left hand and so giving us in the two halves of the line a complete image of Jael's preparations for the fatal act. "Hammer" as a noun at the end of line 3 is then transformed into "hammer" as a verb at the very beginning of line 4, in accord with a general tendency of nominal constructs to generate verbal chains, of actors or agents to produce actions. Line 4 is a strong instance - not only between versets but even within each verset - of the use of a sequence of seeming synonyms which in fact are related to each other syntag-</page><page sequence="18">632 ROBERT ALTER matically, each term closely following the previous one in time, like movie frames: she hammered, cracked, smashed, drove the stake all the way through the enemy's head. Line 5 exploits emphatic incremental repetition to achieve an entirely new effect. Moving in a contrastive overlap from Sisera's head to Jael's legs, or feet ("from foot to head" is a fixed collocation in biblical idiom), the verbatim repetition produces an cffect of slow motion that mimics Sisera's death-agony; with the middle verset of the triadic line exceptionally giving us repetition with one element of the initial utterance ("lay") deleted, heightening the sense of almost suspended motion. Presum- ably, once the blow was struck, he convulsively heaved from the bed, sprawled forward on his knees before Jael, and then lay still - "destroyed," as the line concludes in a finely climactic increment to the repetition, "kneeled and fell."3 My translation of line 6 reproduces the Hebrew word-order, which effects a sharply ironic transition between scenes. If line moves to line by overlap, this is an instance of a false overlap, or what in film would be called a faux raccord between different scenes. The un- specified "she" looking out the window in the first verset might momentarily be taken for Jael, the feminine singular who has dominated all the action up to this point, although of course the presence of a window in a tent would be puzzling, and, as we move into the new scene, we quickly realize that there is a pointed contrast between the simple Kenite tent and the Canaanite palace with its bevy of female attendants so interested in the material benefits of war. When the subject of the verb "look," Sisera's mother, is sprung on us at the beginning of the second verset, we at once take in the dramatic irony even before she utters a word - that she is on the lookout for a warrior son whom we have just seen lying with a tent peg through his temple, destroyed. Her words, both the question and the answer, illustrate the expressive power of the kinds of patterns of dynamic relation between versets we have been following. In line 7, she first wonders about the tarrying of his chariot, and then, in a wonderful focusing move or dramatic concretization, about why she has not yet heard "the clatter of his cars." (The Hebrew pe'amim would refer literally to the pounding or rhythmic sound of the horses' hooves (invoked earlier in the song - Jud. 5:22)). Since the prose narrative in Judges has earlier reminded us that the Canaanite military superiority in 3. It is, admittedly, also possible to construe all these verbs of falling and lying as references, in the pluperfect, to Sisera's going to sleep, in which case the phrase "between her legs" would have to be rendered as "at her feet." But such a reading seems to me strained, in terms of both the narrative context and the semantic range of the crucial verbs.</page><page sequence="19">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 633 the coastal plain is largely due to their iron chariots, this locally effective image also carries a larger historical-thematic irony. In the answer to the question (lines 9-10), the focusing procedure is specification rather than dramatic concretization: The general term "spoil" of the first verset is stipulated initially as captive females, then, in the incremental repetition of line 10 (which is triadic, apparently as part of a closural effect), as dyed stuff, as dyed embroidery (i.e., still more valuable), as a pair of dyed embroidered cloths for every neck. All these details, moreover, reverberate ironically against the previous scene in Jael's tent. The poet takes rhetorical pains to introduce a whole circle of Canaanite court ladies (there is no absolute necessity for their presence, since Sisera's mother in fact answers her own question). These women speak with blithe confidence on behalf of a patriarchal warrior culture. The first instance of spoil they mention is the sexual booty they assume the men have coming to them. The rare term which I, like other translators, have represented here with the courtly "damsel," is actually derived transparently from the word for "womb," and so might in ancient usage have meant something much coarser than "damsel." (The Ugaritic cognate is sometimes an epithet for Anat, the warrior-goddess, which could argue for a more decorous con- notation and, in any case, might suggest an allusion to the fierce goddess in Jael.) Only after invoking the imagined abundance of female slaves do Sisera's mother and her ladies conjure up the lovely embroidery which would be, one gathers, their special share in the booty. All this, of course, stands in shocking contrast to the still lingering - or perhaps even synchronous - image of the Canaanite general felled by the hand of a woman, lying shattered between her legs in a hideous parody of soldierly sexual assault on the women of a defeated foe. With these words of dialogue that are a gloating illusory antici- pation of the spoils of war, the story is sharply cut off, concluding with an appropriate formula of curse and benediction. This very technique, we might note, of leading the reader to draw inferences by abruptly breaking off a story in mid-dialogue, is one frequently employed in the prose narratives (a signal instance is Simeon and Levi's unanswered question to Jacob at the end of the tale of the rape of Dinah, Gen. 34:31: "Will our sister be treated like a whore?"). It would in fact be surprising if there were not occasional carry- overs in technique from the prose to the verse as well as the other way around, but a reading of the prose version of Sisera's death (Jud. 4:15-22) suggests that the different formal logics of the two media lead to strikingly different imaginative definitions of the same</page><page sequence="20">634 ROBERT ALTER narrative data. Let me quote the central section of the prose version: 18. Jael went out to meet Sisera, and she said to him, "Come in, my lord, come into my place, do not be afraid." And he came into her tent and she covered him with a blanket. 19. And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." And she opened the skin of milk and gave him some to drink, and covered him. 20. He said to her, "Stand at the tent opening, and if a man should come by and ask you, 'Is there a man here?', say there is not." 21. Thlen Jael the wife of Hleber took the tent peg and placed the mallet in her hand. And she came to him stealthily and drove the peg through his temple till it went down into the ground, he being fast asleep from exhaustion. And thus he died. The obtuseness of a certain academic preoccupation with sup- posed historical precision is vividly illustrated by the contention of some scholars that there were two different "traditions" about the killing of Sisera, one reflected in the prose and the Other in the poetry. One recent commentator, whom in decency I shall leave unnamed, goes so far as to claim that in the "tradition" transmitted by the poem, Sisera did not go to sleep but was bashed on the head by Jael with the princely bowl, and, thus stunned, was finished off with tent peg and mallet! In point of fact, all the differences between the two versions are a matter of the writers' interpretive rendering of the same event. The single "factual" discrepancy between the two accounts is in the minor detail of the container from which Sisera drank: The prose version, with its homey realistic depiction of the tent scene, mentions Jael's opening of the skin-bottle, with no hint of pouring the milk into a more aristocratic receptacle; the poem, with its generic tendency toward heightening, stresses Jael's serving the milk in a princely bowl. Which of the two accounts is older - the received wisdom of scholarship has been that the poem antedates the prose - is beside our point, as is the question whether the author of the one text knew the other text as we have it. What seems clear is that both poet and prose-writer possessed the same basic narrative data, though not necessarily in any written version. The prose account, in keeping with the standard practice of biblical narrative, chiefly defines the action and the relation between the actors through dialogue, even including, characteristically, a snippet of quoted speech embedded within quoted speech (".. . if a man should . . . ask you, 'Is there a man here?' "). This method of presentation opens up certain possibilities of subtlety and complica- tion of characterization not available to the verse narrative. First Jael is seen (verse 18) in an active role coming out of the tent to greet Sisera, politely and reassuringly inviting him to the hospitality of her tent, also noticing that he hesitates or looks fearful. (The commander of the redoubtable iron chariots has abandoned his</page><page sequence="21">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 635 vehicle and fled on foot after losing the battle.) It is significant that Sisera is assigned no direct reply to her invitation but simply follows her - silently - into the tent, speaking only after she has covered him with the blanket to ask for a drink, and then again, after drinking, to ask her to stand guard for him. (Htis dialogue is all requests, hers all invitation.) The stress he puts in his instructions on there being or not being a man in the tent will be picked up ironically at the end of the story (verse 22), when Jael will say to Barak, the Israelite commander, "Come and I'll show you the man you seek." This version plays almost teasingly with the expected roles of man and woman. Jael's initial words to Sisera might almost be construed as a sexual invitation, but she at once assumes a maternal role toward her battle-weary guest, tucking him in like a child, giving him milk rather than the water he requested. (One might guess that the poetic version avoids direct representation of Jael putting Sisera to bed partly because the poet does not want to mitigate or complicate with maternal associations the image of Jael the triumphant slayer. It is enough to have the implicit ironic contrast between the lethal Jael and the anxious waiting mother of Sisera. It is instructive in regard to the way literary form establishes meanings for narrative data that in the poem the very same detail - the giving of milk instead of water - does not seem a "maternal" act because it is not reported together with Jael's putting Sisera to bed, and because, in an intensifying pattern of verse parallelism, it is presented as a gesture of "epic" hospitality that goes beyond ordinary expectations.) The actual report of the murder (verse 21) has nothing of the poem's crescendo series of smashing and stabbing, but instead seeks to define or clearly explain the mechanics of this extraordinary deed. It incorporates, however, a hint of sexual double meaning: Jael "came to" Sisera, a term often used elsewhere in the case of males to refer to sexual entry, and the driving through of the tent peg into the ground on which the narrator dwells would seem to be what our own age would call a phallic aggressive act. By intimation, then, Jael here is in turn seductress, ministering mother, and sexual assailant, whereas the sharp focus of the poem is simply on the powerful figure of Jael the hammerer, standing over the body of Sisera, whose death-throes between her legs - he is kneeling, then prostrate - may be, perhaps, an ironic glance at the time-honored martial custom of rape. I am of course not suggesting that one version is superior to the other, only that they achieve different effects and that they represent character in the midst of portentous action in crucially different ways. The interchange between Jael and Sisera in the prose</page><page sequence="22">636 ROBERT ALT'ER version is ultimately moral and psychological in nature: The man- slaughtering Philistine oppressor is at first fearful, then reassured, trusting himself implicitly to Jael's care, even assuming the posture of a child; she prudently knows how to soothe, how to minister, how to kill. By contrast, in the poem, the two figures are kept at a certain distance from us and even from each other (there is, of course, no dialogue at all between them) in an almost emblematic tableau: Jael standing, hammer in hand, Sisera the would-be con- queror, prostrate at her feet, destroyed. The prose account plays delicately with different values associated with "ma a" and "woman"; the poem boldly juxtaposes the scene of a woman felling a man with the scene of the enemy women waiting for their men to return bearing captive girls and plundered embroidery, and by so doing it sharpens the edge of triumphal harshness in the story. This general contrast between the two renderings of the event may suggest a way of expanding our initial assumption about the reasons for the general avoidance of narrative in biblical verse. The semantic momentum of the system of parallelism, as I have tried to show analytically, invites, when it is used for narration, a certain unilinear and powerfully heightened representation of character: As actions proceed from strong to stronger, the imposing, inexorable actors, whether human or divine, go from strength to awesome strength. It is hardly an accident that biblical poetry, when it turns, even episodically, to narration, is particularly at home with the depiction of processes of destruction: God descending amidst light- ning and black clouds to rout His enemies; Job assaulted and ma- cerated; armies sweeping like all-consuming fire to engulf Jerusalem; a relentless heroine pounding, smashing, laying low the enemy - all of these actions, except the last, are figurative or monitory rather than historical events. Biblical Israel was compelled to win a purchase on life in the harshest historical circumstances, first wresting its inheritance by conquest, then persisting in the face of hostile neighbors, at the geographical crossroads of great and often ruthless empires. The frequent fierceness of the narrative verse, then, expresses a deep and even predictable current of ancient Hebrew sensibility, but, given the imperatives of ethical monotheism, it was not the main current; and in order to show in story the fluctuating and ambiguous behavior of man as a moral agent acting from the peculiarity of his own individual character, writers had to turn from the emphatic progressive rhythms of parallelistic verse to the freer and more flexible medium of prose.</page><page sequence="23">FROM LINE TO STORY IN BIBLICAL VERSE 637 REFERENCES Alter, Robert, 1981.
