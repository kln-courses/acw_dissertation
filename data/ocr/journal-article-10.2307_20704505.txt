<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NOTE ON THE HEI-TIKI L. M. Groube University of Auckland The greenstone hei-tiki is the best known Maori ornament, and has become in recent years a national and advertising symbol. The world-wide interest in this unique anthropomorphic pendant has not been restricted to its design but includes the material, nephrite or serpentine, from which it was made.(1) These fine grained stones are amongst the hardest materials worked by stone-age man, producing a high polish and extremely hard wearing cutting edge. The historical and morphological significance of the tiki, however, has become somewhat blurred over the years. The publication of Bechtol's paper in this issue of the J.P.S., which may arouse some discussion, gives an opportunity to raise two further points which do not emerge clearly from the published literature. 1. A great proportion of hei-tiki in museums and collections are probably post-European in manufacture. The evidence for this, although not conclusive, is sufficiently convincing to justify a re-assessment of the significance of the tiki in New Zealand prehistory. It is abundantly clear that a "talc" pendant was being worn by some Maori on the coastline of New Zealand during the Initial Contact Period, 1769-1777. Numerous commentaries and rare drawings(2) make it clear that it was a scarce, highly valued ornament. It is equally apparent, however (an observation which has been overlooked), that there is no evidence in the late 18th century of the vast number of tiki which could 1. Turner 1935. 2.

During the 1820-1840 period it was the common pendant style and was being used extensively in trade with Europeans. The vast majority of collectors' pieces comes from these trade tiki. The phenomenon of this sudden abundance of an ornament ground down from an extremely hard stone, showing, nevertheless an amazing degree of identity of form throughout the country must be explained before sheer repetition makes the claim that the tiki is an "ancient form"(3&gt; an unassailable truth. An explanation put forward by several authorities such as Best, Buck and Skinner,(4) that this efflorescence was a response to European trading demands in the North Island has seldom been given adequate considera tion. A strengthening of the internal Maori demand for hei-tiki may also have contributed to the phenomenon. The greenstone tiki, a form of capital in Maori society, may have assumed a new significance with European trading when the traditional capital stone adzes, bone-fishhooks and stone and wooden weapons became obsolete and valueless. Similarly the social dynamics of the interaction of Maori and European (a subject which has not yet been successfully explored), may also help to explain the importance of the tiki in the later nineteenth century. It is clear that one Maori response to European culture was an increase in the size, number and degree of elaboration of art-motifs on houses, canoes and personal ornaments. This early assertion of Maoritanga in art styles during the early years of contact may have increased the internal demand for the tiki ornament. These arguments, however, do not explain why it was the tiki and not the rei-puta or hei-matau which became so important. The concentration upon the tiki in this period of rapidly changing values does not necessarily suggest that it possessed a greater intrinsic value than any other ornament styles. As Skinner warns: ". . . the major part of its mana derives from contact with the great people who have worn it, and not from a magic meaning or from size or beauty".(5) A better, if more mundane explanation is that it was a convenient form to utilise that capital wealth of greenstone adzes rendered redundant by steel plane-blades and iron cutting tools. As has often been noted the tiki outline is close to that of an adze, indeed it is almost the ideal form for converting an extremely hard adze into an anthropomorphic design with the minimum of time consuming grinding. This interpretation of the popularity of the tiki in the nineteenth century (and consequently of the existence of a vast number in museums and collections throught the world), would suggest that it was the value of the greenstone itself (as a form of capital and as trade-wealth) which deter mined the choice as much as any intrinsic cultural significance in the form. 3.

GROUBE This argument is reinforced by two further observations from the Initial Contact Period: (i) Equally, if not more, popular than the hei-tiki as a status symbol with Maori chiefs in 1769-1777 was the rei-puta^ or split whale tooth pendant. This is clearly an anthropomorphised lineal descendant of the Archaic Phase whale-tooth pendant. Significantly the rei-puta did not increase in popularity in the nineteenth century and it rapidly disappeared. In contrast to the tiki it is extremely rare in museum collections and was never seen in use in the nineteenth century/7) This is all the more surprising considering that whales' teeth became more common with the establish ment of whaling stations. (ii) Of significance, too, is the rapid disappearance of the greenstone adzes so commonly mentioned by explorers of the Initial Contact Period/8) Although there are many extant greenstone adzes in museums it seems a fair assessment that there do not appear to be enough to justify the explorers' unanimous commentary. From museum collections in the North Island there is a remarkable absence of fine edged stone tools in sufficient numbers to justify the elaborate wood-working traditions of the Maori. The many tons of coarse grained 2b (Duff) adzes, the majority with poor cutting edges, could not have done all the tasks of house joisting, canoe building and so-on which were required. For some tasks one greenstone adze would be worth many dozens of the unsophisticated graywacke forms. The possibility that the vast majority of the highly valued hard-wearing greenstone cutting tools were converted into orna ments (tiki and ear pendants) and subsequently traded and presented as gifts could explain not only the relative poverty of fine-edge cutting tools but (in contrast to the South Island), the less frequent occurrence of greenstone. The efflorescence of //fcz-ornaments in the 19th century therefore can be interpreted as a reflection of the value of greenstone itself. The fact that the bulk of this wealth was in adze-form in 1769, and the hei-tiki was an ideal modification from an adze, may explain the relative abundance of */fc/-styles. 2. Bechtol quotes Mead as stating, "the peculiar grotesque form of the hei-tiki is the result of the artist's attempt to impose the shape of the adze blade upon the human figure". In fact, as Skinner and many others have claimed/9) this imposition is the other way around; the imposition of the shape of the human figure on an adze blade. The above argument would strengthen this claim, and the fact that on many tiki the evidence 6. See for example Beaglehole 1962:17, also Plate 7. 7. Golson 1959:51. 8. Banks says: "[their tools] ... are made of stones of different kinds their hatchets especially of any hard stone they can get but chiefly of a kind of green talc which is very hard and at the same time tough; with axes of this stone they cut so clean that it would often puzzle a man . . . These axes they value above all their riches and would seldom part with them for any thing we could offer" (Beaglehole 1962:24, 25). 9. Skinner 1932:208; 1966:10. 455</page><page sequence="4">A NOTE ON THE HEI-TIKI of conversion from an adze is clearly apparent, with the original flat polished surfaces and bevel still visible, removes it from the sphere of speculation. Many tiki were adzes. Tiki showing all stages of conversion from adzes to ornament can be found in all major museums in New Zealand. The Otago Museum displays a case with a complete series from large adze to finished and polished tiki. Tiki which do not show a bevel could still have come from an adze, as many of the larger greenstone adzes would have supplied several tiki, only the bottom two of which would have bevels. Obviously the thoroughness of manufacture would affect the survival of remnants of the original adze form. An argument proposed by Skinner to explain the predominant adze outline of the hei-tiki, that the Maori converted the greenstone on the West Coast sources into the familiar adze shape for easy transportation to their homes before making them into tiki,ao) cannot be taken seriously. A more reasonable suggestion is that for various reasons during prehistory an occasional adze (perhaps sanctified by historical or ancestral associa tions) was "anthropomorphised" or decorated with an anthropomorphic figure, in much the same way that wood or bone was carved. During the historical period the obsolescence and redundancy of greenstone adzes accelerated this pattern. In this light, variations in tiki shape may owe more to the type of adze form which they were derived than to stylistic preference. For instance the tapering of the head of Taranaki tiki which Skinner suggests is copied from the wood-carving of the district, looks to the eye of a more rheumatic observer as if it were the corner of an adze.(11) This habit of superimposing the tiki form on adzes may explain the beautiful matau tiki form, in the British Museum, where the eyes and body of the tiki figure have been carved onto a hei-matau (hook pendant).(12) If the dominance of the adze on the tiki-forva is accepted, then the most significant tiki forms are those which do not show obvious influences of an adze. These are the rare la forms described by Skinner in 1932,(13) often with an upright head, a narrow neck, sometimes with open arms or legs. Noticeably the head is smaller in relation to the body, the eyes are less stylised and exaggerated, in fact the form is far closer to the general style of Maori anthropomorphic art than is the bulbous adze-derived lb type.(14) Skinner's claim that the la form is the archaic style may well be right but equally they may represent anthropomorphic pendants made specifically for this purpose, copied perhaps from a small wooden proto type which would be very similar to many wood carving forms. The angled head and distorted limb structure of the lb (standard) tiki form may suggest the impact of the extremely hard material upon the craftsman, and economical and necessarily stylised conversion from an adze. 10.

The common hei-tiki form is an economical adaptation of one form of wealth (a greenstone adze) into another form of wealth (a greenstone ornament). 2. The rare la form of Skinner, which is not obviously derived from an adze, is closely related to standard anthropomorphic styles of Maori art. 3. The survival of the hei-tiki into the nineteenth century was the product of coincidence of European and Maori attitudes to the value of greenstone. If this had not been then the hei-tiki, like the rei puta, could have become a rarity. REFERENCES Beaglehole, J. C. (ed.), 1962. The Endeavour Journals of Joseph Banks, 1769 1771.
