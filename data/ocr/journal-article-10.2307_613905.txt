<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 595 THORKILD JACOBSEN : Toward the image of Tammuz and other essays on Milesopotamian history and culture. Edited by William L. Moran. (Har- vard Semitic Series, Vol. xxI.) xii, 507 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1970. (Distributed in G.B. by Oxford University Press. ?5.75.) In this volume W. L. Moran has collected 17 papers selected as representative of the work of Thorkild Jacobsen and ranging from 1930 to 1965. Interspersed with the main articles are a number of short poems or parts of poems translated by Professor Jacobsen from the Sumerian, and at the end of the volume there are a bibliography of his writings and a lexical index to his works. The papers cover in general the fields of religion, social and economic history, and Sumerian grammar. Three of them set out the author's highly individual conception of the origins of the Sumerian pantheon and the essential nature of Mesopotamian religion; three others are devoted specifically to the mythology of Tammuz (Dumuzi) and Inanna. In the field of social history we have Professor Jacobsen's well-known essays on 'primitive democracy' and the development of kingship, together with his discussion of 'the assumed conflict between the Sumerians and Semites in early Mesopotamian history', while a shorter article discusses the procedure in a criminal trial of the Isin-Larsa period. The article on 'The waters of Ur' embodies the results of his investigation of the canal system of lower Mesopotamia carried out in 1954 when he was Annual Professor of the Baghdad School. Ibbi-Sin's reign receives special attention in two papers, one historical on the sequence of events leading to the downfall of the dynasty, one economic, on the textile industry, based on an archive of texts pub- lished in Ur excavation texts, III, and dating from this reign. The last three articles are purely philological and are devoted to the analysis of the Sumerian verbal forms and the use of the accusative personal pronoun in what appears to be an ablative sense. Professor Jacobsen is one of the world's most eminent Sumerologists; his knowledge of the language is unrivalled and his facility in translation is universally admired. The samples of his renderings of Sumerian poetry printed in this book provide abundant evi- dence of this gift (though the Assyriologist will regret the absence of any indication of the source of the extracts). He is also a scientific investigator of a high order and one feels complete confidence, for example, in his study of the canal system, based on the assumption that human settlement was possible only along rivers and canals and that therefore a survey of all existing settlements (tells), dated by their surface pottery, will reveal linear patterns representing the lines of the major water- courses. But he is also a philosopher, not content merely to describe what is presented in the sources, but seeking always to probe beneath the surface and interpret what is given in terms of a particular philosophy, that of Rudolph Otto for religion (pp. 1, 39, etc.), that of William Oakeshott for history (p. 368). His interest in the canal system and the problem of soil salinization stems from his realization that these are among the most basic factors determining the course of Mesopotamian history. Even in studying the Sumerian verb he is not content merely to classify the various elements in general terms but seeks to determine the precise significance of every one; the note on the prefix mu alone runs to seven pages of small print. On this part of his work only a specialist in Sumerian would be competent to form a judgement. But it is in his interpretation of Sumerian religion that Professor Jacobsen is most controversial. His views have been pro- pounded largely in lectures and contributions to symposia and works of reference, and it is therefore good to have these papers combined in a single volume together with the more specialized articles, the footnotes to which provide at least some of the philological basis on which the structure rests. Many of these footnotes are whole articles in themselves and sometimes occur in unexpected places. For example, Dumuzi and Inanna are repeatedly said in the first three chapters to be respectively 'the quickener of the young one (in the mother's womb)' and the 'Lady of the date clusters ', a personification of the store- house in which the date harvest was kept. The philological explanation is to be found, for Dumuzi, on p. 338 in a footnote to the edition of the myth of Inanna and Bilulu, and for Inanna on p. 376, in a footnote to the article ' Early political developments in Mesopotamia' (which also deals with the name Ama-ushumgal-anna, interpreted as 'the one great source of the date clusters '). Such interpretations are in accordance with Professor Jacobsen's view that in origin the Sumerian deities were non-human, 'intransi- tive' numina, each inherent in a particular phenomenon and constituting its life-force and will, each visualized in the form which later became degraded as the deity's' emblem '. Thus Enki is ' the numinous inner will to form in the Deep, visualised as a gigantic ibex, the antlers of which showed above the water as reeds' (p. 7): Ningishzida is 'perhaps the</page><page sequence="2">596 REVIEWS god of the winding tree roots, as he was originally envisaged in serpent shape' (p. 24); Damu is the 'god of the sap that rises in the spring' (ibid.); Bau is originally the goddess of the dog, and Professor Jacobsen does not hesitate to interpret her name as 'Bowwow' (p. 33). According to him, the anthropomorphic form in which these deities appear in literature and art is a later development. It may be pointed out that the other senior American Sumerologist, S. N. Kramer, will have none of this. For him the Sumerian deities were always anthropomorphic; Jacob- sen has been misled by reading into the works of the mythographers speculations of a rational character which they never intended.1 His interpretations and etymologies ' are to be taken with a sizeable grain of salt ', though his translations are 'superb, precise, penetrating and reliable '.2 The present writer feels more at home with Kramer's approach, but would welcome a more systematic exposition of Jacobsen's views. On a sounder basis, perhaps, is Professor Jacobsen's attempt to link the pantheon to the economy by assigning the deities in their origin to the distinct life-patterns of the marsh-dwellers, the orchard cultivators, the herdsmen, and the farmers. This approach seems particularly fruitful, though there are awkward overlaps. The short essay on 'the central concerns' of Mesopotamian religion-- famine in the fourth millennium, war in the third, personal guilt in the second, is also one of the most successful in this field. Professor Moran has performed a valuable service by assembling in a single handy volume these scattered papers by a scholar of such outstanding individuality. O. R.
