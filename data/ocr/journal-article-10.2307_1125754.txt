<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Form and Function of Children's Questions EDITH A. DAVIS STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM AND SUM- MARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS HE literature on child develop- ment nowhere yields an analysis of unselected spontaneous ques- tions asked by a large number of children in the every-day home situa- tion. This is surprising in view of the fact that we find interest in the subject ranging all the way from the genetic approach of Darwin (7), Taine (28), and others (15, 16, 22, 25) to the recent functional classification of Piaget (21). To Bain (1), Compayre (6), Sully (27), and Bohannon (2) the asking of questions is due to the in- stinct of curiosity. Woodworth (34) points out that the driving force is "curiosity regarding some particular thing." To Bohannon (2) inquisitive- ness and curiosity express "defective self-control," or in Sully's (27) words "a mood of general mental discontent and peevishness." Hall and Smith (11) made a pioneer analysis of ques- tions in connection with a study of curiosity in its relation to interest. Out of 1247 questionnaire descriptions of cases of curiosity, 477 were questions, but since they were reported from memory they could hardly be accurate in form or representative in content. The authors suggest that "a list of all the questions asked by a child during a week or a month would probably furnish material for a very fair guess at his interests and surroundings." Some information as to frequency of questions may be obtained from the conversation records of the pioneer students of language development. Boyd (4) found that questions con- stituted 21.6 per cent of the 1250 remarks made by his daughter which he recorded annually from her second to her eighth birthday. Trettien (29) recorded 49 questions in one hour's observation, 22 per cent of the total conversation during the hour. The Brandenburgs (5) classified 18 per cent of their child's conversation as ques- tions at thirty-eight months, 20 per cent at fifty-two months. The con- versation of the two six-year-old boys studied by Piaget (21) yielded 17 and 13 per cent of questions. Nice (18) reports the lowest percentage found by any of these investigators, 11.2 per cent in the conversation of a forty-seven months old girl during a thirteen hour day. The normative language studies of Smith (23) and McCarthy (17) throw further light on this point. They are of especial value since they deal with groups of children at successive age levels, instead of being confined to one or two individuals. Both these studies find that the percentage of questions 57</page><page sequence="2">58 DAVIS: Children's Questions increased with age up to about five years, when the investigations were concluded. McCarthy's results, ob- tained from children carefully selected for age, sex and, socio-economic status, seem conclusive. Between the ages of thirty-six and fifty-four months, questions made up 14.4 per cent of the conversation of children in the upper socio-economic classes, 7 per cent of that of children in the lower socio-economic classes. There has been much speculation as to the function of questioning in child development. Sully (27) finds two categories: (1) thirst for fact (what, how old, where, who, naming); (2) reason and cause (why), beginning at two, but most frequent from three to four years. The motivation may be "desire for order and connectedness" leading to anthropomorphism; teleo- logical (cause, purpose); and a deeper "sense of perplexity, mystery, con- tradiction." Trettien (29) finds reason and cause linked with the anthro- pomorphic attitude and following the simpler questions of "fact, substance, action, place." Snyder (24) differenti- ated four categories, of which that be- gun by the interrogative words is last to appear and most complex. Her others are variations of the imperative, in- volving co6peration, permission, or approbation; questions of fact (counterpart of declaration); and a combination of question and exclama- tion. Smith (23) adapted the Snyder classification, including requests for permission, approbation, or corrobora- tion as a fifth category. Stern (25) describes two ages of questions, the naming period, reached in the second half of the second year, and the three to four year stage of when and why, directed mainly toward justification of commands and the desire to know. Hollingworth (12) places the Question- ing Age from three to six and classifies the motivation as first, genuine cu- riosity; second, the desire to check up the child's own generalizations by the approval of one better informed; and third, getting and holding the atten- tion of others. Piaget (21) has de- veloped the most complete classifica- tion of questions to date, and reported it in such detail that it could be used in the present study. A teacher recorded 1125 of the spontaneous questions of a six year old boy on daily walks of about two hours extending over a ten months period. Unfortu- nately she began by recording only Whys, and midway changed her procedure so as to include all ques- tions, thus making it impossible to calculate percentages for the various categories. METHOD The questions analyzed in this study were recorded by mothers attending study groups conducted by the Paren- tal Education Department of the Institute of Child Welfare at the University of Minnesota. They were provided with blanks adequate for recording 50 questions, together with the explanatory data concerning time of day, person questioned, and similar information needed to make the ques- tions intelligible. An instruction sheet was furnished with the blanks. Mothers were requested to start the record in the morning and as far as possible to continue without a break,</page><page sequence="3">DAVIS: Children's Questions 59 including everything of interrogative form except single word questions, which would often be so obscure in meaning as to make classification im- possible. Periods such as nap, school, or outdoor play during which the child was not under the mother's observa- tion, were to be omitted. Meaning was to be clarified by parenthetical explanation and underlining the em- phasized word. Mothers were cau- tioned against polishing up the child's language, or attempting to elicit ques- tions. The instructions were closely observed, and the records were care- fully and very satisfactorily filled out.* No attempt was made to control age, sex, or socio-economic status, save that the age limits were roughly set as three and twelve years. Blanks were returned only by mothers belonging to the three upper socio-economic categories. It seems probable that such factors as interest in the study of children, leisure to indulge this interest, and the ability to fill out a fairly complicated blank, would necessarily operate to select a superior group of mothers. This situa- tion made it impossible to verify the findings of other investigators (8, 10, 17) as to the marked differences in speech development between children of the upper and lower socio-economnic classes, but the results of this study are not at variance with them. Four- teen of the 30 children whose blanks were completed most quickly have parents belonging to the professions. A study of children's questions would not be complete without some comparison with the questions of * From the Institute of Child Welfare, the University of Minnesota. The cobp- eration of the mothers who made this report possible is greatly appreciated. Grateful acknowledgment is also made to Dr. Esther McGinnis and" the Parent Edu- cation staff for distributing blanks and in- teresting mothers, and to Dr. John E. An- derson, Dr. Florence Goodenough, and Dr. Mary Shirley for advice and assistance in preparing the material for publication.

To obtain an adequate samp- ling of adult questions proved im- possible, so following the example of Boyd (4), recourse was had to the printed page. Fifty questions were taken from the conversation of two male and two female characters of contemporary fiction, and these were supplemented by 300 questions ex- tracted from legal testimony as pub- lished verbatim in newspapers. To what extent the fact-finding objective of the court situation held the ques- tions to stereotyped forms as com- pared with random conversation is unknown, but the material has the merit of being actual spoken language recorded on the spot by experts. These 500 questions were classified like those of the children, and comparisons were made on a percentage basis. RESULTS Seventy-three records, 39 for boys, 34 for girls, were returned, making a total of 3,650 children's questions for analysis. The age distribution of sub- jects is given in table 1. The distri- bution is continuous, the four year group, for example, containing all children whose ages fall between three years six months and four years five months. Because of this fact, and the small and variable number of cases at each level, year by year comparisons like those made by McCarthy (17) are impossible, but comparisons on the basis of an older-younger division re- veal certain age differences. When sex differences in the two groups are pre- sented, the reader should bear in mind that the younger boys are slightly younger, the older boys slightly older, than the corresponding girls. Length of questions in words Nice (19) suggests that length of sentence affords a simple criterion of advance in mastery of speech, and McCarthy (17) found an increase from year to year in sentence length. Table 1 shows a similar slight but consistent increase in the length of questions. The difference in mean length between younger and older age groups is sta- tistically significant (D/SD dif. 6.55), but the total range in length is very constant for both groups. The questions of girls are probably sig- nificantly longer than those of boys (D/ SD dif. 2.55). The distribution according to length in words for younger children, older children, and adults is shown in Fig. 1. The simi- larity of the curves suggests that the four to six word question is best suited to the expression of interrogation in the English language. Comparison of mean length shows that the questions of adults are significantly longer than those of children (D/SD dif. 9.70), but 42 per cent of the adult questions are of six words or less, and only 7 questions out of the 500 exceed the maximum length for the children. Fig. 2 compares the length for boys and girls, and here the curves are almost identical. Time required to obtain fifty questions Although instructions on this point were explicit, some recorders did not make it clear just how long the child was under observation. If John comes in from school at 3:30 p.m. and asks a question, but there is no further entry until 6:30 p.m., are we to assume that he asked no questions during that time?

The time range was from 30 minutes to 14 hours 5 minutes, but the</page><page sequence="6">62 DAvIS: Children's Questions writer seriously doubts whether the time is accurately stated when the total period is many hours long. Question asking is variable, depending on the situation, the interest of the moment, fatigue, and many other factors. One mother returned two blanks obtained from the same child at an interval of two months. The time for obtaining the first quota was 9 hours 55 minutes, for the second, 5 hours, 15 minutes. It seems clear that the situation does not necessarily determine the rate. Table 3 shows that children 1 and 10 asked their questions on motor trips in 38 and 56 minutes respectively. On two occa- sions the writer recorded questions asked by boys on motor trips, when the parents were present and the child was under accustomed surround- ings; yet child 26, aged seventy-six months, asked only 36 questions in 3 hours 45 minutes, and child 35, aged one hundred nine months, asked 20 questions in 5 hours and 45 minutes. In view of the inconclusive findings in regard to time it was decided to com- pare the 15 boys and 15 girls whose records were completed in the shortest time, since there is little likelihood of error where records are nearly or quite continuous. Table 3 indicates that boys ask questions faster than girls, but there is no evidence that the rate falls off with advancing age. Circumstances under which questions were obtained Table 3 also summarizes the situa- tions under which the greater part of these continuous records were made. The circumstances seem fairly repre- sentative of the usual interests and activities of the ordinary child. One constant factor (of writing being done) was present in every situation save one, where the mother sat on a screened porch and recorded the questions as they were asked of a neighbor. How foreign this writing was to the child's usual experience of course depended on the every day routine of the in- dividual home. Forty blanks con- tained no questions due to the writing, 13 contained one, 9 contained two, and so on, up to a maximum of twelve. In the last named instance, the ques- tions were recorded during Sunday dinner, and writing at the table was of course a novelty. Eighty-six ques- tions out of the 3,650 were attributed to the writing, and these were of very great variety. The most frequent was, 'What are you writing?' This was often followed by asking why the Institute of Child Welfare wanted to know, or when the mother would be through. Several children wished to do some writing themselves, to borrow the pencil, or to use the desk. One four-year-old boy at lunch asked, 'Do you see how I do like you-write in between bites?' Others wondered if the mother were writing a letter, a poem, a recipe, or an encyclopedia. Special note was made of these 86 questions, since there was no other factor common to all the situations under which questions were obtained, and no other unusual occurrence re- sulted from the recording. That it was not unusual to all the children is indicated by the fact that more than half the records were not influenced by it at all.</page><page sequence="7">TABLE 3 Age, time required, and situation under which questions were asked, for 15 boys and 15 girls whose records were obtained in the shortest time CHILD I AGE TIMEI SITUATION Boys months minutes 1 47 38 Motor-car trip down town 2 47 117 Household routine, playing with brother 3 48 48 Lunch hour Younger group ..... 4 48 110 Playing with new toys 5 57 66 Lunch hour 6 60 40 Discussing adult activities Average................... 51.1 69.8 7 61 103 Morning routine 8 61 98 Solitary play 9 66 60 Trip down-town, street-car 10 72 56 Motor trip, Duluth to St. Paul 11 74 85 Conversation on porch, adults and chil- Older group. dren dren 12 79 65 Play with friend, age 89 months 13 89 90 Solitary play 14 89 30 First visit to friend, age 89 months 15 108 45 Constructive play with friend 89 months Average .................... 66.5 70.2 Average all............. 60.4 70.0 Girls A 32 118 Outdoor play, mainly in swing B 39 128 Household routine C 39 130 Sunday morning routine D 53 79 Morning routine Younger group.......

III, NO. 1</page><page sequence="8">64 DAVIs: Children's Questions THE FORM OF QUESTIONS There seem to be in English two principal ways of asking questions. They may begin with one of the in- terrogative words, or with an inflected form of one of the auxiliary verbs. Piaget (21, p. 219) calls the latter "simple questions," and does not differentiate the various auxiliaries in accordance with frequency of use. In English, however, these "simple questions" are nearly always expressed by means of the auxiliary do. Where the French say Pensez-vous? the Eng- lish say, Do you think? The impor- tance of these auxiliary verbs has been demonstrated by Stormzand and O'Shea (26) who found on analysis of 10,000 sentences selected from litera- ture, newspapers, and school com- positions that 68 per cent of the verbs used were irregular, and that the auxiliaries were used three times as often as all other irregular verbs put together. Since the inflection of these verbs has to be learned by long prac- tice, and since their use expresses shades of meaning less essential than the main verb, we would expect the young child frequently to omit them altogether, and here lies a partial ex- planation of the increase in sentence length with advancing age. For the purposes of this study the emission of the interrogative word or of the ex- pected auxiliary form renders a ques- tion incomplete. It is also possible to ask a question merely by the tone of the voice, as You live in M2inneapolis? This sort of question was seldom found on the children's records. More fre- quent was the addition of can't I, or doesn't it? to a declarative sentence. McCarthy (17) did not classify these as questions, because she was following Piaget's socialized-egocentric classifi- cation. While questions are ipse facto socialized, many sentences of the type under consideration are egocentric in that they express the desire for appro- bation and corroboration noted by Snyder (24) and Smith (23), or for social contact described by Johnson (14). But to have told mothers to leave out such questions would have made instructions, already long, much too complicated, and would have in- troduced a large source of error. Moreover, Piaget, includes such ques- tions in the study described in Chapter V (21) and if we accept Claparede's definition of a question as "the con- scious realization of a problem" whose function is "an incitement to mental activity in a certain direction in view of readjustment" there is justification for such a course. If complete cer- tainty existed, it is not likely that the question would have been asked. It is not easy to detect a difference between lncle Ed lives in Chicago, doesn't he?, and Doesn't V/ncle Ed live in Chicago? especially from the written form. Such questions have been listed separately under the heading Declarative plus Interrogative. The percentage dis- tribution of questions among these four categories were tabulated. Boys are more likely than girls to begin their questions with interrogatives (D/SD dif. 3.31); girls are more likely than boys to use the auxiliary verbs. Adults use fewer interrogatives and more auxiliaries than children, hence the sex difference may be due to the slight superiority of girls in language development which has been demon- strated in other studies. On the other</page><page sequence="9">DAVIS: Children's Questions 65 hand, boys ask more questions involv- ing cause or explanation, and usually begun by why, what for, what makes, or how, while girls were found to ask more questions involving permission, and other social relations, which begin with may I, shall I, and similar phrases. In short, the obtained difference in question form may be the result of unequal ability in handling the instru- ment of language, or of dissimilarity in the interests motivating expression. The fact that older girls use a sig- nificantly greater number of auxiliaries and smaller number of interrogatives than younger girls (D/SD dif. 3.65, 3.35) suggests that both maturation and training are involved. Adults are more prone than children to omit the interrogative word, or the auxiliary form which expresses in- terrogation. This was more marked in the questions taken from fiction than in the legal testimony., The inflected forms of the auxiliaries seem to be much more frequently omitted than the interrogatives by both children and adults. The obvious interpreta- tion is that the adult, having mastered inflection, leaves out non-essential words to save time, while the child who is still having difficulty with the precise shades of meaning conveyed by mood and tense, is painstaking in putting them in. The use of the declarative-plus-interrogative form seems to be an individual rather than a sex or age characteristic, although it is possible that situation and mood may have some bearing. We would expect questions begun by auxiliary verbs to be longer than those, begun by interrogatives, and this was found to be the case. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS In making a functional analysis of the questions Piaget's classification system was followed, with the addition of a category for social relation and one for rhetorical question. These changes were necessitated by the greater variety and complexity of situations under which these questions arose, and perhaps by the greater freedom of the American parent-child as compared with the French teacher- pupil relationship. That Piaget's scale is a usable instrument is indi- cated by the score-rescore reliability of .88 obtained by the writer while still in the early stages of the work of classification. Similarly, a colleague who has never read Piaget's book and who was asked to classify the 86 questions mentioned above as arising from the child's reaction to writing, questions which were much more diffi- cult to classify than a random samp- ling, did the scoring with a relability of .77. The doubtful cases fell for the most part in the categories of Reality and Classifications, in which the dis- tinctions are sometimes finely drawn. Confusion of causal, action, or social questions almost never occurred. In general the scale was satisfactory. The results of the classification ac- cording to function are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The distribution for both age and sex is surprisingly constant. As we would expect because of the small number of questions per child the standard deviation for the cate- gories is always large. Thus, questions of cause ranged from 0 to 22; of social relations, from 0 to 25. Although there are few differences between categories which are statistically significant, there</page><page sequence="10">66 DAVIS: Children's Questions are several which are of interest as indicating trends. Boys ask more questions of causal explanation than girls (D/SD dif. 3.07); they also ask more questions involving classifica- tion (D/SD dif. 2.03) and definition (D/SD dif. 2.95). Girls, however, effect of the school system and social pressure on the spontaneity of lan- guage, but the data offer no evidence that the rate of question asking de- clines with age.

This finding, to the earlier writers (3, 13, 20, 27, 32, 33) would constitute proof as to the crippling the time the child is learning to read. Certainly it is just as probable that reading affords a new opportunity of finding out things, as that the child is discouraged by the attitude of adults. Questions of calculation apparently receive an impetus with the beginning</page><page sequence="11">DAVIS: Children's Questions 67 of the school age, although the in- crease is not statistically significant. Boys may ask more questions in re- gard to meaning of words because they have rather more difficulty than girls in acquiring vocabulary. Analysis of the data shows that the difference between boys and girls in the number of questions involving social relations lies for the most part in the much greater number of per- Analysis of the functional categories by length yields statistical confirma- tion of some obvious facts. It is apparent that more words are required to ask Why do you write so fast? or Are we all going for a walk through the park? than Is this red? or What does "obsolete" mean?

PERSONS QUESTIONED Piaget (21) concludes that children are prone to question other children in regard to actions and intentions, or "the factual aspect of reality," whereas questions asked of an adult concern causes and motives. In order to test this point, questions were classified according to the persons addressed. The divisions were mothers, fathers, all other adults (maids, plumbers, aunts,</page><page sequence="12">68 DAVIS:- Children's Questions grandfathers, even strangers on the street), children within a year and a half of the child's age, older children (the age of sixteen was arbitrarily taken as the point at which a child became an adult), younger children, animals, dolls, and no one in particular. In the final analysis all children were thrown together, as there semed to be no difference in type or length of ques- tions asked of older or younger chil- ever, since in many instances recording was done in the partial or total ab- sence of the father, nor do the records enable us to estimate to what extent the child had the opportunity of ad- dressing the father. 18 girls and 21 boys asked no questions of the father. The child-adult comparison sug- gested by Piaget yields only negligible differences, although it is true that the A[sked of- chlildron ' o u LO Social CLassifi- Calcu- R-katoricat Caalitq al Acons relations cation laiort quh-Hons FIG. 5. PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES OF CHILDREN'S QUESTIONS ASKED OF CHILDREN AND OF ADULTS dren. The percentage of questions asked of other adults varied greatly, because some records were made by aunts or adult friends, and there was always a chance factor involved in the selection of a certain time or place for recording questions. The most in- teresting result of this analysis is the large percentage of questions asked of the mother and the small but con- stant percentage asked of the father. No conclusions may be drawn, how- percentage of causal questions asked of children is slightly smaller, and the percentage of action questions slightly larger, than the corresponding per- centages asked of adults. Boys ad- dress a large percentage of their ques- tions of calculation to the father. Girls ask fewer questions of cause of the mother and of children than of the father and of other adults; boys, on the other hand, address more causal ques- tions to the mother. All children nat-</page><page sequence="13">DAVIs: Children's Questions 69 urally enough address fewer questions of social relations to other adults than to their parents, whose authority they recognize. The percentage of such question asked of children, however, is only slightly below that of questions asked of parents, indicating that these children are well imbued with respect for the property and personality rights of other children, and are meticulous in requesting rather than commanding their cooperation. Fig. 5 compares the questions asked of children with those asked of adults. The only statistically significant difference between questions asked of adults and those asked of children was in length, questions addressed to adults being longer (D/SD dif. 5.50). SOURCE OF QUESTIONS Of the 3650 questions, 87.8 per cent were attributed by the mothers to something in the immediate situation; 10.8 per cent to remembered or remote events; 1.4 per cent could not be accounted for by anything in the child's known experience. This classi- fication is necessarily rough and there is no check on its reliability. Because of the widespread interest in the memory of young children the remote questions were studied in detail, but with little result. The mean number of such questions per child was 5.41, with a range from 0 to 18, and with no age or sex difference. Questions dealing with past events tend to fall into the categories of Reality and Actions, but on the whole the percent- age distribution of Remote questions among the functional categories cor- responds very closely to the total distribution. More Remote questions are asked of adults than of children, and Remote questions are significantly longer than immediate questions (D/SD dif. 5.25). Girls ask 14 per cent of their Remote questions of the father, and 70 per cent of the mother. Boys ask 1.4 per cent of the father, 77 per cent of the mother. There is a suggestion that Remote questions are prone to originate from conversation with adults. ORIGIN OF QUESTIONS It would seem very possible that some activities and situations are more likely to call out questions than others. Mothers were asked to classify the origin of each question as best they could under eight suggested headings, conversation of adults, conversation of children, stories, pictures, activities of children, activities of adults, personal routine, and miscellaneous. The records indicate that the mothers used great care in this classification, fre- quently clarifying their decisions by explanatory notes, hence their classsi- fication was accepted even in cases where there was apparent contradic- tion. The question, What time is it? was found under nearly every one of the eight headings, since it might result from hearing adults discuss the hour of a concert, from anxiety over being late for school, from looking at a pictured clock, or from the desire to dress or undress in record time. Furthermore, conversation with chil- dren and adults may be going on simultaneously, and was sometimes so recorded. Because of this very elastic classification the data are con- sidered only as suggestive of trends. Conversation with adults showed the</page><page sequence="14">70 DAVIS: Children's Questions highest percentage of the activities calling out questions. INTERESTS OF CHILDREN AS INDICATED BY QUESTIONS An attempt was made to determine the interests of these children on the basis of their questions, as was sug- gested by Hall and Smith (11). The mothers were not asked for any im- pressions as to the children's interests, hence the question with an occasional explanatory note was the only source of information. Obscurity as to the interest involved made it necessary to eliminate 242 questions from con- sideration. The usual interests of children of the age range under con- sideration were tabulated from the Anderson-Goodenough Baby Book and the Lehman and Witty Play Quiz,, and the questions checked against this list. A few items had to be added, and one (collecting) was not repre- sented in the questions. The result was a list of 53 items some of which are themselves comprehensive. Thus, Active and Competitive Play included organized athletics and the activities of Boy Scouts as well as random out- door play; Constructive Play might mean making doll clothes or building with Lincoln Logs. It was necessary to combine such items to keep the list within bounds and to obviate the necessity of classification under two headings where there seemed to be overlapping of interests. Any list of this kind is likely to be affected by personal bias, but in the majority of instances the interest is clear. The interests were tabulated in two ways, the number of questions in which a certain interest could be de- tected, and the number of blanks on which it was found. When the items were ranked in the order of their fre- quency of occurrence from greatest to least, the coefficient of correlation (Spearman rank-order formula) was found to be 0.94, hence the results are given for one method only (the first). Age and sex differences where found were in keeping with previously es- tablished differences in play equip- ment, mental test scores, and educa- tional achievement. Boys asked. an average of 3.3 questions about ma- chines (airplanes, motors, engines, trains, mechanical toys), girls 1.8 questions. The 20 older boys asked 6 questions in regard to school and homework, while the 17 older girls asked 31 questions. Girls asked slightly more questions in regard to household work (average 1.88, for boys 1.26). The younger boys asked 16 questions about personal appear- ance, the younger girls 17; the older boys 2, the older girls 21. Clothing irrespective of personal appearance ('Where are my other bloomers?' 'Do I need my sweater?') received more attention from girls (average 2.35 ques- tions, boys 1.36). Boys asked an average of 1.74 questions in regard to natural history, excluding farming and pets, girls 1.15 questions. Natural phenomena, such as weather, storms, meteors accounted for 1.95 ques- tions of boys, 1.47 girls. Questions in regard to meaning and use of lan- guage averaged 3.15 for boys, 2.82 for girls. The degree of community of in- terests between boys and girls, and between older and younger children, was determined by computing the</page><page sequence="15">DAVIS: Children's Questions 71 coefficient of correlation (Spearman rank-order formula) between the fre- quency of occurrence of each item for boys and for girls. These indicated a decrease in community of interests between boys and girls with advancing age, and there is a suggestion that the difference between the interests of older and younger boys is greater than that between older and younger girls. That a community of interests ex- ists is further demonstrated by com-, paring the extremes of the distribution for boys and for girls. Six of the ten most frequent items and four of the ten least frequent items are found on both lists, and in no case is an item at one extreme for one sex and at the opposite extreme for the other. Interest in theology and sex seems to be very slight. Very probably the findings of other investigators (11, 30) were affected by the fact that the records were made from memory. Obviously the amusing or unusual question is recalled, while the common place query in regard to some matter of every day life is not. These five questions concerning the nature of God were asked by five boys, all less than six years old: God has wings to get down with, hasn't he? Did Marje see God? (sister claimed she had) Why does God give us pigs to eat? Is God there? (in Ceylon) Does God hear this? (blowing horn). Forty-nine questions dealt with de- nominational differences and going to church, including these references to the Resurrection: Is Jesus dead now? Mother, what does "He is risen" mean? How did the angel know Christ was risen? Mother, why did that angel (picture) have a palm leaf in her hand when the ladies came to Jesus' grave? How did Jesus get up? Seventeen of these 49 questions were asked by one six year old boy, in regard to Catholics and convents. Only 14 questions were found which could be classified as sex questions: What is this skin for? (testicles-child in bath) Will she have baby birds some day? Does the baby calf come out of the mother? Do they look like little seeds? What do they look like when they are in the mother? Who are I going to marry? Will I ever marry when I grow up? Do the baby deer come out of an egg like the chickens do? Where do the baby deer come out of the mother deer? Does it hurt the baby deer when it comes out of the mother deer? What is this? (germ plasm in egg) How did it get there? What do they (little chickens) do when their mother leaves them? You wouldn't think, would you, that this little speck could grow into a chicken? SEQUENCES OF QUESTIONS Every observer of children has noted the frequency with which a long series of questions is set off by a single remark or occurrence. To Wallon (31) this is pathological, and Faegre and Anderson (9) caution parents against trying to answer all their children's questions fully and completely. The records were analyzed to discover a possible age or sex difference in the number of questions on a single topic or logically following from a former question, and to determine whether</page><page sequence="16">72 DAVIS: Children's Questions there is a tendency for sequences of questions to center around certain interests. Note was made of all cases where two consecutive questions were thus related, and if three or more con- secutive questions dealt with a single topic or were logically interrelated these were listed as sequences and studied in detail. There were found to be 238 sequences. Every blank contained at least one sequence, and one blank yielded seven. Forty-four of the 50 questions on one blank were in sequence. The average length of sequences was 4.44 questions. The longest sequence was that of 17 ques- tions on denominational differences mentioned above. There was one of 16 questions on making doll clothes, and one of 14 questions on the pro- cedure at funerals. Analysis by age and sex did not show any difference in the number of questions on a single topic. The mean number of consecutive questions on a topic for younger boys was 1.68; for younger girls 1.54; for older boys 1.52; and for older girls 1.58. If we may assume that length of sequence is a rough measure of strength of interest, the next step is a comparison of the number and length of sequences concerning the various interest items with the frequency of such items for the total distribution. Sequences proved hard to classify, since the last question of the series may touch on a topic far removed from the original .question. One boy began with What kind of meat is this? and ended with Where will I work when I grow up? yet the logical procedure from question to question was per- fectly clear. Classifying the sequences as well as possible, 41 of the 53 interest items seemed to serve as the central topic of a sequence. The 12 items not repre- sented are sleeping, personal appear- ance, occupations, farming, memory and opinion, social relations, current events, sex, acts of affection, colors, God, dreams and fears. Money, fires, circuses, birthdays, other places and peoples, war, and helping are found in the boys' sequences but not in the girls'; jokes, electricity, school, gov- ernment, funerals, diseases are found in the girls' but not in the boys.' These sex differences mean little, since the frequency of occurrence in one sex but not in the other is never greater than two. This analysis of sequences accord- ing to the interest involved yields nothing conclusive, but there is a sug- gestion that for this group of children a long series of questions results from an unusual occurrence or novel bit of conversation, rather than from the desire to attract attention or the lack of adjustment which is Wallon's ex- planation (31). It might be expected that a connec- tion would be found between the type of question beginning a sequence and the length and general topic of the sequence. When a child asks a causal question is he in a "frame of mind" which leads him to continue asking questions? Analysis of the initial questions of sequences yields no evi- dence that this is the case. The first questions fall into the functional cate- gories in very nearly the proportions obtained for the total distribution, and no one type of question tends to pro- duce long or short sequences. These findings like those of the other analyses indicate that children are motivated</page><page sequence="17">DAVIs: Children's Questions 73 to ask series of questions by actual interest in something going on. There is no temporary "set" toward classi- fication, causation, or merely getting attention. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Further study of children's questions along many lines is needed before any definite conclusions can be drawn. The data analyzed here indicate that the child in the present day American home of the upper socio-economic levels employs questioning, as does the ordinary adult, because it is an efficient and convenient means of extracting satisfaction from contact with other people, acquiring information about external reality, perfecting his com- mand of the instrument of language, and achieving adaptation to the phy- sical and social environment in which he finds himself. The findings of this study may be summarized as follows: 1. Analysis was made of 3650 ques- tions asked by 73 children between the ages of three ahd twelve years, and recorded at the time of asking. For purposes of comparison 500 ques- tions asked by adults were taken from printed material. 2. Boys asked questions at a faster rate than girls but younger children did not ask them faster than older children. 3. The length in words of the ques- tions increased with age. Girls' ques- tions were somewhat longer than boys' questions. Questions of 4 to 6 words were characteristic of both children and adults. 4. Boys more often than girls began their questions with interrogative words; girls more often than boys began their questions with inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs. The use of questions declarative in form with the addition of an interrogative phrase, or the omission of the interrogative, seemed to be an individual rather than a sex or age characteristic. 5. Boys asked more questions in- volving causal explanation than girls; girls asked more questions on social relations than boys. 6. Causal and action questions were most frequently 6 words in length, questions on reality and social rela- tions 5 words, those on classification 4 words. 7. Eighty-six per cent of the ques- tions were asked of adults, thirteen per cent of children. Questions asked of adults were longer than those asked of children, but there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in type of question addressed to adults. 8. Eighty-eight per cent of the ques- tions seemed to result from the imme- diate situation, eleven per cent from remote events. Remote questions were longer than other questions and were asked of adults more often than of children. 9. The interests of boys and girls as indicated by their questions seemed to be very similar. The difference between boys and girls increased with age, and the interests of boys changed with age more than those of girls. 10. There were no age nor sex differences in the tendency to ask a series of logically related questions starting from a single topic. Although a novel occurrence seemed more likely to call out a very long series of ques- tions, any of the ordinary situations might serve as a starting point for such a series.</page><page sequence="18">74 DAVIS: Children's Questions REFERENCES (1) BAIN, ALEXANDER: Education as a science.
