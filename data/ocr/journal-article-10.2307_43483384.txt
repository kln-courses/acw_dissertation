Of the coins issued by the Ariya kings of Jaffna, only a few copper coins have yet been found and among them about 20 different issues have been identified by Rev. S. Gnanapragasar, O.M.I. Generally, on the obverse is delineated a grotesque human figure with a head, two arms, bare body, a flowing robe and two legs. One hand holds a flower in the posture of smelling it and the other hand holds some sort of a weapon. A trisula or a lamp is also depicted under the left arm. A similar representation is also found in the Chõla and Polonnaruwa coins. There is no doubt that it is a symbolical representation but its meaning has not yet been correctly or even sufficiently explained. On the reverse are a couchant bull in the centre, the crescent moon with a dot above it, three dots in a triangular form on a side, and other dots below the bull, all enclosed in a semicircular line in certain issues, and the legend Sētu in Tamil characters below the base of the semicircular design. This symbolical representation has both a religious and a philosophical meaning. The couchant bull is the representation of Siva and Sakti, a combination of Purusha and Prakriti - and the resultant Universe or Cosmos which is sometimes represented by the Swan (Hangsah) in North India. This is yet another representation of the mantric sound Aum. Over the Aum is the sign of Chandra Bindu or Nāda and Bindu shown as a crescent moon with a dot or a point over it. In some of the old pictorial representations of Aum or Õngkãra, Nāda and Bindu are represented by a crescent and dot. Nada and Bindu are found in all Bija mantras which are shown with Bindu above and Nāda below, for this is the form of Chandra Bindu. Nāda and Bindu are states of Sakti, " in</page><page sequence="2">590 journal, R.A.s. (ceylon) [Vol. XXXI. which the germ of action (Kriya Sakti), so to speak, increasingly sprouts with a view to manifestation producing a state of compactness of energy and readiness to create." Nāda and Bindu are two of the many aspects óf THAT which in India is called the Mother or Great Power (Mahā Sakti). This is both the efficient and material cause of the Cosmos which is its body. Nāda is the man trie name of that Power which gathers itself together as Bindu to create the universe and which Bindu, in so creating, differentiates into a trinity of Energies which are symbolised by A.U.M. Nāda and Bindu thus represent the Turiya state immediately before the manifestation of the Universe in which animate life exists in the three conditions of dreamless sleep, dream and waking. The three dots or Tribindu constitute the great triangle of World-Desire. They are the three Saktis, Ichchā, Gnãna and Kriya from which the three guņas Sattva, Rajas and Tamas develop. They are also sometimes made to represent the Sun, Moon and Fire. From them the Trimurtis Rudra, Brahma and Vishnu and the three devis Raudri, Sarasvati and Vārna issued. Thus Param êswara assumes for the created, successively, the triple aspects of Sakti, Nāda Bindu and Tribindu, thereby completing by this differentiation of Sakti the sevenfold causal sound forms of the Praņava or the Öngkära. Sētu is the holy shrine of Râmêswaram. The symbol on the reverse of the Jaffna coin is, there- fore, the anthropomorphic representation of the creation of the Universe and Paramêswara, the creator, whose holy shrine is at Râmêswaram which was then within the kingdom of Jaffna.</page></plain_text>
