By Leszek Kolakowski. Translated from the Polish by P. S. Falla. 3 volumes. Oxford University Press. $19.95 each. To someone like myself, who was charac- terized for many years as the foremost Marx- ist among American philosophers, the resur- rection of Marxism and Marxist views in Western thought, particularly in Anglo- American academic circles, has a paradoxical and even amusing side. For it comes at a time when, in the light of the historical record, most of Marx's predictions and expectations have been falsified. What passes for Marxism today is largely a mélange of doctrines that differ from Marx's leading ideas and that he would have scornfully disowned for all their sentimental socialist fervor. When I completed the manuscript of my Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx in the late fall of 1932, the economic depression was at its worst; Hitler was waiting in the wings to take power; and in the thinking of many intellectuals, and in the fears of even more, a socialist revolution seemed to be a live option. That book, which appeared on the fiftieth anniversary of Marx's death, was actually published during the American "bank holiday" in 1933, when capitalism seemed finished even though no one had any idea of what was to replace it. In it I pre- sented a version of Marx that was fundamen- tally empirical: I did not argue that Marxism О SIDNEY HOOK, emeritus professor of philoso- phy at New York University, is senior research fel- low at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford. Among his recent books are Pragmatism and the Tragic Sense of Life and Revo- lution, Reform and Social Justice. was a science, but that it was a scientific method of achieving a socialist society. Now that we are approaching the hun- dredth anniversary of Marx's death, the scene is quite different. Capitalism is not on the verge of collapse. In most countries it has de- veloped into a welfare state not anticipated by Marx. The three cardinal doctrines of clas- sical Marxism lie in ruins. The theory of his- torical materialism - which holds either (in its strong form) that the mode of economic production determines political change or (in its weak form) that it conditions such change - has been refuted by Lenin and Mao Tse-tung. Whether the economy they and their successors built is called "socialism," or "industrial serfdom," or a new form of Asiatic despotism, they succeeded in doing what the theory of historical materialism declared im- possible. By seizing political power they built a new economic foundation under it, whereas Marx had anticipated that the economic structure of socialist society would be built within the shell of the old. Many of Marx's predictions about the de- velopment of the capitalist economy have been realized, but those that presumably fol- lowed from his theory of value and surplus value have not. Society has not been increas- ingly polarized between a handful of capital- ists and the workers. The working class has not been progressively pauperized; nor has it become the overwhelming majority of the population; nor has there been a decline in the rate of profit. Despite the existence of 250</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR pockets of poverty, the standards of living, as well as the longevity of members of the work- ing class, have risen. In startling contrast to the situation that existed when Marx wrote Capital, the life expectancy of members of the middle class and of the proletariat do not markedly differ. The emergence and persistence of nation- alism have revealed the limitations of Marx's conception of the overriding significance and weight of the economic class struggle in un- derstanding historical events. Certainly class antagonisms are always present, and they of- ten erupt into open struggles - a phenome- non discovered by thinkers before Marx. But anyone who still believes that "all history is the history of class struggles" would be baf- fled to account for the not inconsiderable amount of class cooperation, both in ordinary times and for some great events in times of crisis. The conception of class struggle, for ex- ample, can hardly apply to World War II, when democratic capitalist powers allied to a despotic socialist power fought other des- potic capitalist powers. Nor can it throw much light on the recent wars between states having socialized economies. Since wars are bred by "classless" socialist societies as well as by class societies, the causes of war cannot be found in what differentiates the two. How, then, explain the scores of volumes whose authors have accepted the validity of Marx's analyses to a degree that is, in their minds, sufficient to justify their proclaimed allegiance to the Marxist tradition? There is a special explanation in each individual case, but in the present climate of opinion one can sense a pervasive and subtle attitude that fa- cilitates the identification. No longer is there any danger in being known as a Marxist, es- pecially in the elite universities. The label stamps a teacher and scholar as a man of the Left, and therefore sympathetic to the resis- tance of the counterculture to the estab- lishment, however it is defined. It endears one to the student body, especially to campus or- gans of opinion that almost invariably are in the hands of young men and women who look back with a wistful envy to the golden and glorious era of the sixties. At the same time that it absolves one from the suspicion of being a vulgar anti-Communist, it lifts the burden of having to defend the Gulag Archi- pelago. The U.S. and the USSR can be damned with a fine impartiality, and if the brunt of criticism falls on the U.S., that is only because the U.S. is where one lives. Some revolutionary wishful thinking may en- ter into the desire to vindicate either Marx's overall vision or some specific analysis, but there is no doubt about the good faith of these self-denominated Marxists. Some of them even completed reputable works of scholarship before embracing the Marxist ide- ology - although those who knew their Marx would never call it an ideology. Regardless of the reasons for the revival of Marxist allegiance, what all expositors and adherents have in common is a conception of Marx that makes his doctrines impervious to empirical confirmation or refutation. None of the recent Marxists - whether in history, poli- tics, economics, psychology, or sociology - meet the criterion of scientific significance formulated a long time ago by Charles S. Peirce, the father of American pragmatism. Peirce insisted that no one could legitimately claim to possess knowledge about the world unless he could indicate what kind of objec- tively verifiable experience would constitute evidence of a doctrine's inadequacy or inva- lidity. Peirce did not mean that one should abandon a theory as false immediately on finding a single negative case. He somewhere points out that most tough-minded scientists would hold to a theory in the face of a few falsifying pieces of evidence, but insists that the difference between a scientific truth and a myth is determined by one's knowledge of what counts for and what counts against the specific hypothesis that guides one's inquiry. Despite all the epistemological refinements that show how complex the concepts of meaning and truth are, the acceptance of this criterion is crucial to any doctrine that claims to be scientifically acceptable. And if any- thing is indisputable in the canons of Marx- ism, it is the claim of both Marx and Engels that, in contradistinction to the teachings of socialists of other schools, their doctrines were scientifically valid. In the absence of any conception of the kind of evidence that would make Marx's statements about the economy and history at least refutable in principle, any belief can be attributed to him or be characterized as Marxist. The result is that today when a per- son characterizes himself as a Marxist, we no 252</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR more know what he really believes than we do when a person claims to be a Christian. Almost at random my eye lights on a long piece in the New York Times Book Review in which an academic historian discusses several books on China: Among all the great revolutions, the Chinese Rev- olution of the past hundred years has been, in many ways, the most authentically Marxist. It did not take place in a rich industrial society, but rev- olutions have never been effected in such a so- ciety. However, it is the only revolution that, in line with Marx's prediction, moved to socialize af- ter long periods of capitalism and with a dynamic roughly compatible to the one Marx postulated. According to this author, the Chinese Marxist revolution must have begun in 1880, when Marx was still alive. How strange that he did not recognize it. It was "authentically Marxist" despite the fact that China was not a highly industrialized society and no revolu- tions have ever taken place in such a society. But does that not constitute a refutation of the authentically Marxist view that a socialist revolution can occur only in a highly industri- alized society? And if China has been a capi- talist country for "nearly a thousand years," as the reviewer goes on to say, does it not make nonsense of the very first sentence of Marx's Capital, in which capitalism is charac- terized by "an immense accumulation of commodities"? One can multiply indefinitely instances of this kind of so-called Marxism. Neither Marx's texts nor the fallout of historical events serves as a sober control over what Marx said or meant. The emotive con- notations of key terms have shifted with the times. When I was a student, before and dur- ing World War I, the very word "capitalism" was suspect. Only socialists and other sub- versives used it. The leading representatives of the existing economic order were loath to call the system under which they lived "capi- talist." A vestige of that state of mind still survived in Nicholas Murray Butler, who was president of Columbia University when Louis M. Hacker published his Triumph of Ameri- can Capitalism; Butler liked it very much ex- cept for the word "capitalism." The attitude toward Marx, not only in the press but in aca- demic circles, was a compound of ignorance and hostility. When I carried my soapbox propaganda into my high school and college classes, to the discomfiture of my teachers, I had the advantage - not that I profited from it - that none of them, with two exceptions (M. R. Cohen and J. Salwyn Schapiro), had ever read anything of Marx firsthand. To them it was enough that the Bolsheviks called themselves Marxists, and the fact that the leading Marxists of the world were bitterly critical of the Bolsheviks was not known. Even when they noted the importance of class struggles, few professional historians concerned themselves with Marx, either on the undergraduate or the graduate level. Economists ignored him. Charles Beard, whose sympathies were always with the un- derdog and who professed a vague ethical so- cialism, never understood why those who accepted the Marxist theory of historical ma- terialism rejected his version of it as a narrow and false view of economic self-interest, closer to Bentham than to Marx. I The present vogue of Marx studies and the doctrinal stance of Left-oriented intel- lectuals - "We are all Marxists of a sort these days" - make all the more noteworthy the publication of Leszek Kolakowski's Main Currents of Marxism - the first volume of which is devoted to its Founders, the second to its Golden Age, and the third to its Break- down. The work is an intellectual event of the first order, although the editors of some of our leading organs of opinion have not deigned to notice it. Kolakowski, who was purged for his heresies from the Communist party of Poland and then deprived of his post as professor of philosophy at the University of Warsaw, is currently a fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He has put all scholars and intelligent laymen interested in Marx and Marxism in his debt. Hereafter no one who undertakes to expound or criticize Marxism can afford to ignore his work. Regardless of qualifications and points of difference (and I have several major ones with him), Kola- kowski's magisterial study must be acknowl- edged as opening a new era in Marxist criti- cism. The reasons for this are many. First, it is the most comprehensive treatment of Marx, 254</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR and of thinkers in the Marxist tradition, so far published. Only a few significant figures, close or distant in kinship to Marx and his ideas, have been overlooked. I was surprised to find no account of Henri de Man's pro- foundly interesting study, The Psychology of Socialism, and even more surprised at the in- adequate treatment of Waclaw Machajski, who was probably the first to formulate a the- ory predicting the rise of a new ruling social class under socialism - the intellectuals - that would exercise a new type of exploitation. Yet his omission of Joseph Dietzgen, the pro- letarian philosopher, seems justified. His sim- plistic reflections had no influence on sub- sequent socialist thought. More important, but not surprising because it reflects typical European insularity, is Kolakowski's un- awareness of American critical currents of Marxist thought in the thirties that antici- pated some European developments a gener- ation later. He is also unaware of Lewis Feuer's original research on the influence of American Utopian socialist colonies on Marx. On the other hand, Kolakowski discusses interesting writers in the Marxist tradition who are unknown to me and, it is safe to sur- mise, to other scholars ignorant of Polish - for example, Ludwig Krzywicki, Kazimierz Kel- les-Krautz, and Stanislaw Brozozowski. Their ideas, however, seem less important than those of his fellow Pole, Oskar Lange, of the University of Chicago. Lange, before he ca- pitulated to the Kremlin (because, as he once told me, "The U.S. is not willing and pre- pared to fight the Russians on the River Bug"), had characterized the peculiar econ- omy of the Soviet Union as "an industrial serfdom." He argued, together with Abba Lerner, for the feasibility of a democratic market socialism. In addition to the comprehensiveness of the study - the chapters on Antonio Gramsci, Georg Lukács, and the Frankfurt School are outstanding - Professor Kolakowski manifests a virtue in rare supply among the fiercely polemical contenders for the legacy of Marx. This virtue is his capacity - the secret of his remarkable expository skills - for an empa- thetic and interpretive presentation of the views that he considers before he dissects them, although it is not in evidence in his treatment of Karl Kautsky. In some cases he is much clearer than the authors themselves. This is true not only for Lukács, with whose interpretation of Marx he is in agreement, but for the different varieties of neo-Kantian- ism that sought to modify and amplify the Marxist analysis and critique of the historical development of capitalism with a medley of vague ethical notions. One cannot fail to be impressed with Kolakowski's substantive scholarship. He seems at home in all fields: the sciences, philosophy, economics, the or- ganization and strategies of political power. His methodological sophistication and capac- ity for drawing relevant distinctions help him and the reader to carry the burden of his eru- dition. As refreshing as it is unusual in this area is Kolakowski's fair-mindedness. Even when one differs with him, one is aware of his free- dom from parti pris, his independent judg- ment, his desire to recognize the truth from any quarter, and his readiness to challenge es- tablished reputations without a show of dis- respect. Here is no sectarian at work. Al- though clearly establishing that the Marxism of Jean Jaurès was seriously flawed, Kola- kowski does ample justice to Jaurès's great- souled humanism and his attachment to those universal ethical values that all Marxists themselves invoke - despite difficulty in ac- counting for their validity from a purely his- torical point of view. And Kolakowski recog- nizes the indisputable merits of secondary figures like Paul Lafargue, Marx's son-in-law, regarded by most critics merely as a superb propagandist. To stop short with the list of its merits, one may note that Kolakowski's book is chock-full of arresting observations. Independent of the thrust of his analysis, these illuminate the men, movements, and events discussed in all three volumes. Almost every page contains a nugget of insight. For example, he explains why Eduard Bernstein, the first great revi- sionist of Marx, retained as much influence on the German workers as did Kautsky, the war- horse of orthodoxy, with a remark that sums up the situation in Germany, the home of the strongest Social Democratic party in the era of the Second International: "The revolution- ary idea was much more the property of the party intellectuals than of the working masses." In one aperçu he exposes the key weakness of Jaurès's attractive social philoso- 256</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR phy: "Like most pantheists he believed in universal salvation, the ultimate reconcil- ability of all things; i.e., the non-reality of evil." In dispatching the many attempts to di- lute the claims of the theory of historical ma- terialism so as to escape the absurd con- sequences of the monistic version in Marx, the early Engels, Kautsky, and George Plekhanov, he truly observes: "Historical ma- terialism in such watered down terms may provide a contrast to the type of history, such as St. Augustine's, which relates everything to the design of Providence: but it does not con- stitute a specific method over and beyond what every historian is prepared to recog- nize." Despite Marx's contumacious treatment of Moses Hess, Kolakowski observes that Hess was "the first writer to express certain ideas which proved especially important in the his- tory of Marxism." He leaves no doubt that Marx's social ideal provides for the presence of an individuality which, in contrast with so- cieties that call themselves socialist today, "is not diluted into colorless uniformity" - but whose authenticity does not depend on de- stroying the individuality of others. Regard- ing persistent efforts to resolve the con- tradiction between the first and third volumes of Capital by interpreting Marx's analysis to apply to "an ideal type of capitalism," he aptly remarks, "Such interpretations protect Marxism against the destructive results of ex- perience only by depriving it of its value as an instrument of real life social analysis." Of greater originality is Kolakowski's anal- ysis of the concept of "exploitation" in Marx. To the mystification of followers and critics alike, Marx had claimed that it had no ethical significance in his system but that it was the corollary of a fair and legal exchange be- tween the worker and his employer. Kola- kowski shows that it can be coherently de- fined without invoking the doctrine of surplus value from which Marx derived it. He con- cludes his acute discussion with this observa- tion: "Exploitation consists in the fact that so- ciety has no control over the use of the surplus product [which must be present in any society if it is not to dissolve into civil war], and that its distribution is in the hands of those who have an exclusive power of deci- sion as to the use of the means of produc- tion." This analysis, if valid, is of momentous importance, for it would follow that, in the absence of democratic processes in determin- ing social distribution, exploitation is possible even in a completely nationalized or social- ized economy. Kolakowski's reading con- forms with Marx's disavowal of egalitarian- ism. It implies that only the democratic sharing of the power to distribute the surplus product would end the exploitation of man by man. This is in perfect accord with Marx's commitment to democracy. But it is subject to the charge of utopianism on two counts. First, it assumes that fairness, regardless of the results of distribution, is only a matter of process - as if the democratic process could never result in oppression - and, second, it leaves open a likelihood that Marx seems to have persistently ignored: that there may be other forms of human exploitation which are not reducible to economic terms. These matters may be regarded by the non- specialist as peripheral to Marx's contribu- tions. The general reader would probably be more concerned with Kolakowski's assess- ment of Marx and the Marxist tradition; the extent to which Lenin was a faithful follower of Marx; the relationship between Marxism and the Russian October Revolution of 1917; the roots of Stalinism, if any, in Leninism; and the responsibility of Marxism for Stalin- ism. Before these questions are treated, how- ever, something should be said of Kola- kowski's contrasting of the Marxism of Marx with the Marxism of Engels. Here he is both original and provocative. Orthodox Marxists, whether Socialist or Communist, have looked askance at persons who, like me, have criti- cized Engels for his gratuitous introduction of metaphysics and ontology into Marx's scien- tific world view. Kolakowski believes that the gulf between Marx and Engels is even deeper than anyone has suspected and for the aston- ishing reason, among others, that Engels was too sympathetic to positivism. This is especially evident in Engels's view that as scientific knowledge develops, philosophy - as a discipline purporting to give verifiable knowledge about nature, society, and man - will disappear, evanescing into the study of logic and the practice of logical analysis. Such a view, although it does not speak much for Engels's consistency, is hardly to his dis- credit, and there is no evidence whatever that 258</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Marx believed philosophy in the traditional sense would remain an autonomous dis- cipline. Kolakowski is on better ground in recognizing that, while both Marx and Engels are committed to an evolutionary emergent naturalism, Engels's spectator theory of knowledge and its naive correspondence-doc- trine of truth cannot do justice to the activity of the human mind in knowing. But when Kolakowski, stating the difference, discusses the meaning of praxis in Marx, he rides a strange hobby horse: "Whereas Engels, broadly speaking, believed that man could be explained in terms of natural history and laws of evolution to which he was subject, and which he was capable of knowing in them- selves, Marx's view was that nature, as we know it, is an extension of man, an organ of practical activity." There is a certain ambiguity in this attri- bution of anthropomorphism to Marx. If it means only that "knowledge cannot be di- vested of the fact that it is human, social and historical knowledge," it is a commonplace which Engels certainly acknowledged. Music, literature, art, and religion are also human so- cial and historical products; but what must be explained is that science yields knowledge whose validity transcends the social and his- torical context in which it is discovered. To go beyond this, to suggest that the very con- tent of knowledge (that is, the truth of what is known) depends upon man, smacks of an idealism that ill comports with Marx's rejec- tion of Hegel. But if Kolakowski means that the human praxis involved in the process of knowing makes a difference to the object of knowledge, then it is a very significant asser- tion which raises an important question: How it is possible for the mind to be active in knowing and, in virtue of that activity, to in- troduce changes in the situation under in- quiry, and still be capable of achieving valid knowledge intersubjectively? With respect to the social scene, Kolakowski agrees with Lu- kács's bizarre reading of Marx, that the rev- olutionary consciousness of the proletariat through its praxis solves the problem - a no- tion I shall examine later. In passing, I note only that Kolakowski's almost total ignorance of John Dewey 's theory of knowledge pre- vents him from seeing another and more plausible answer to the question. II According to Kolakowski, the whole of Marx's thought can be best interpreted in terms of three motifs: the Romantic, the Faustian-Promethean, and the rational, de- terministic outlook of the Enlightenment. It is significant that Kolakowski refers to the third motif not as scientific but as "scien- tistic" - a disparaging term that connotes the inappropriateness of employing scientific methods to some subject matter rather than to false theories about it. The Romantic motif is expressed in Marx's moral passion for an integrated human being in an organic society. From it flows his criti- cism of the phenomena of human alienation, and the main features of the Communist Uto- pia in which the division of labor is abolished, the state and civil society disappear, and the relationships that embrace all members of a loving family extend to all members of so- ciety, indeed the whole human race. In view of this idyllic view of the future of man, it is obvious why orthodox Marxists and orthodox Freudians must be at dagger's point with each other. The Romantic strain is also apparent in the Marxist rejection of the traditional liberal philosophy, as expressed in Locke, Hobbes, Bentham, and Mill, and its justifications of the social contract and human rights. This philosophy, writes Kolakowski, "assumes that human conduct is necessarily governed by selfish motives and that their conflicting in- terests can only be reconciled by a rational system of laws which safeguards the security of all by limiting the freedom of each. This implies that men are one another's natural enemies, each one's freedom being the natu- ral limit of everyone else's." What Kolakowski overlooks, as does Marx, is that the philosophy of liberalism implies only that men are potentially one another's natural enemies - which is perfectly true and quite compatible with the view that they are potentially one another's friends. The consid- erable number of young men and women dur- ing the twentieth century who embraced Marxist communism because they blithely as- sumed it was an extension of liberalism - Ste- phen Spender is the classic case - shows that they understood neither liberalism nor Marx's communism. 260</page><page sequence="7">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Despite the influence of the Romantic ideal, Marx detached himself from it in at least three respects, through savage polemics against those who, he thought, were affected by its rosy glow. First, Marx had no nostalgia for the past; he was oriented exclusively to- ward the future. Whether or not the future is progressive, it is irreversible. The nostrums peddled by nature enthusiasts, if univer- salized, would return mankind to the idiocy of village life. Second, his thought was per- vaded by the ideals of a secular international community. The spiritual harmonies of reli- gion, the nation, the Volksgeist, or the imag- ined colorful village life celebrated by the Romantics of his time and previous times, could be idealized in art, but never realized in contemporary life. Third, Marx's attitude toward technology, if not worshipful, was en- thusiastic. He lost few nights of sleep, but one of them was a consequence of the feverish intellectual excitement generated by a visit to a scientific technological exhibition in the 1850s. Marx believed, as Kolakowski suc- cinctly puts it, that "the destructive effects of the machine cannot be cured by abolishing machines but only by perfecting them." Kolakowski does not even mention, how- ever, what seems to me Marx's chief differ- ence with the Romantics. Marx did not be- lieve that man had an original and fixed human nature from which he was necessarily alienated. Kolakowski's whole exposition of Marx is based on the uncritical assumption that Marx adhered from first to last to Lud- wig Feuerbach's notion of the species nature of man. This is a fateful misreading, probably due to Kolakowski's own view about the na- ture of human nature. But the question here is not whether Marx is right or wrong but what he believed. Not only does he explicitly state in Capital that all history is a transfor- mation of human nature; it follows from his famous critical gloss on Feuerbach that the human essence consists in the totality of man's social relationships. Since these rela- tionships are historical in character, they change, and human nature, as distinct from its biological basis, changes too. For Marx, human psychology is social psychology. Here too Marx is at one with John Dewey, whose Human Nature and Conduct develops the theme in persuasive detail. The Promethean motif in Marx's thought expresses itself in twofold fashion. An impas- sioned defiance of all the gods of heaven and earth and a contempt for traditions and insti- tutions that cannot justify themselves by ac- ceptable fruits in experience are preemi- nently embodied in his faith in human power to control one's social destiny and, within limits, one's natural environment too. This Promethean mood was certainly not unique to Marx. It was shared by other rebels who loathed Marx and he them. But it did not take the shallow form that Kolakowski implies when he imputes to Marx an indifference to the human condition, an obliviousness to the essentially tragic sense of life in the career of finite, fallible creatures against a cosmic background that conditions all that they were, are, and will be. This overlooks the fact that for Marx these features of the world, however irreducible, are irrelevant to a rea- soned social philosophy. When they enter into human affairs, they function like a reli- gion to distract human beings from concern with remediable evils by agonizing over first and last things. Marx was no philistine. It is unjust to say of a man who was at home with the Greek tragedies, who knew Shakespeare and Dante and Goethe by heart and cited them appositively in his work - a man whose own life was marked by intense grief, the death of loved ones, the anguish of frustrated ambition and personal betrayal - that "Evil and suffering, in his [Marx's] eyes, had no meaning except as instruments of liberation; they were purely social facts, not an essential part of the human condition." What invali- dates Marx's vision of the social harmony of the classless society of the future is not death and the facts of human finitude, but his fail- ure to recognize the likelihood of a variety of social evils and possibilities for human op- pression in a collectivized economy. The in- anities of socialist Utopia-mongers, for whom the Revolution is not merely a historical but a cosmic event, should not be laid at Marx's door. It is not the denial of death or the tragic sense of life that expresses Marx's own Uto- pianism but, among other things, his absurd view that in a classless society all division of labor would be abolished, rather than its in- human excesses, and his failure to appreciate the Goethean insight that one of the keys to great achievement, except for the Leonardos 262</page><page sequence="8">BOOKS of this world, is self-limitation. Hegel's theory of alienation was far more profound. The third motif in Marx is one that Marx himself chiefly stressed: the rational, scien- tific approach to human affairs. This is appar- ent in most of the writings that he published when, so to speak, Marx became a Marxist. Kolakowski discounts its significance except for its tendency to breed confusion in the minds of Marx and his followers. The mis- chief derives from Marx's emphasis upon the presence of laws determining the structure and development of society and from his fail- ure to do justice to the complex and difficult question of reconciling social determinism and human freedom. Like many other natural scientists of the nineteenth century, Marx used the language of "inevitability" in describing the succession of societies, and particularly the advent of so- cialism. Yet he could not have meant it liter- ally (any more than by "contradictions" he meant the relation of logical incompatibility). For he was no fatalist. His whole lifework was predicated on the assumption that knowledge makes a difference, that the outcome of his- torical events will be influenced by whether the working class accepts the truths of Marx- ism and has the courage to act on them. To him the rise of the workers' class con- sciousness is not undetermined, but it is not determined by the same events that give rise to class struggles. The laws that govern capi- talist society do not depend upon our knowl- edge of them, but our knowledge of them may lead to actions that will produce a so- ciety in which they no longer operate. Other laws then take over. Just as in scientific medi- cine we can use our knowledge of biological laws to eliminate plague and other diseases, so we can modify social life to a point in which poverty, prostitution, unemployment, and economic exploitation disappear. Scien- tific physicians would never assume that when current diseases are eliminated man- kind will be free of disease. Many Marxists, however, assume that when current social evils are eliminated there will be no others of any significance. The laws of nature that con- dition all human effort and the existence of all societies are not affected by our knowl- edge of them. Marx would have agreed with Spinoza that we can change nature only by natural means. Nor is the validity of social laws, if any, affected by our knowledge of them - only their scope. Kolakowski disputes this analysis of Marx's scientific motif. He asserts that for Marx the questions of "determinism or human free- dom, belief in historical laws or human initia- tive have no meaning," on the grounds that Marx had overcome the dualism between fact and value, between what is and what ought to be. How Marx did it he leaves completely unclear, despite some obfuscatory pages in which he tries to explicate Lukács's ideas. As must be apparent, Kolakowski's assess- ment of Marx is not a conventional one. With respect to almost all the scientific predictions that Marx ever made, Kolakowski concludes that they are false, that at best they have heu- ristic value in calling attention to the per- vasive effects of the underlying economy on the structure of social and cultural life, and the alternatives of action and belief which they frame. What he regards as distinctive to Marx, in contrast to Engels's simplistic scientific naturalism, is a view of human knowledge in which understanding and trans- forming the world are integral to the process by which the working class acquires the con- sciousness that leads to socialism. Although he is severely critical of Georg Lukács for his Stalinist allegiance and contemptible per- sonal behavior, he claims that Lukács's indis- putable merit is his recognition of this "essen- tial feature of Marxism" - something all the Marxists during Marx's own and later genera- tions failed to see. He seems unaware of how utterly bizarre is the notion that no one truly understood Marx until Lukács wrote. Ill Before evaluating Kolakowski's assessment of Marx, something should be said of his treatment of the post-Marxists to whom two of the three volumes are devoted. Kolakowski rejects the German Social-Democratic tradi- tion, as expressed in Kautsky's interpretation, as unfaithful to the soul of the dialectic revo- lutionary principle in Marx and as too naive in its reliance on the immanent laws of capi- talism and its collapse to bring about a so- cialist society. He underplays both the intel- lectual significance of Eduard Bernstein and the vindication of Bernstein's criticisms of 267</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Marxist orthodoxy by events. Bernstein is the true father of the Bad Godesberg program of present-day German Social Democracy. In a fascinating chapter that should be pre- scribed reading for literary intellectuals who have been beguiled by Leon Trotsky's tragic fate and by his rhetorical brilliance, Kola- kowski shows that in all essential matters Trotsky's doctrines - and, when he was in power, his practices - were no different from those of Stalin. Trotsky's passion for party de- mocracy arose when he and his followers were victimized by Stalin. It did not extend to the far greater multitudes of non-Commu- nists, innocent of any crimes, who experi- enced an earlier, if not worse, fate. Less controversial today - after Solzheni- tsyn's searing history of the Gulag Archi- pelago, which traces its justifications to Le- nin - is Kolakowski's analysis of Lenin. It is a clinical annihilation of those who would dis- pute the evidence that Stalin, despite Lenin's testament urging that he be removed as party secretary, was Lenin's legitimate ideological heir. By judicious citation Kolakowski leads the reader to the inescapable conclusion that "There is absolutely nothing in the worst ex- cesses of the worst years of Stalinism that cannot be justified on Leninist principles if only it can be shown that Soviet power was increased thereby." Still, Kolakowski does recognize some difference between Lenin and Stalin. For one thing, Lenin called his op- pressions by their right names, whereas Stalin was a master of mendacity. This well-fortified conclusion about Le- nin's responsibility for creating the system that bred Stalin will bring cold comfort to those in the American radical movement who anticipated that judgment forty years ago. I recall an article by James Burnham in a Par- tisan Review of 1939 in which he declared Stalin to be "Lenin's heir" and which pro- voked a loud outcry on both sides of the At- lantic. George Orwell, who was by then a confirmed anti-Stalinist, found this bitter truth so unpalatable that he denounced Burn- ham as "a Fascist" for daring to see in Stalin's deeds the harvest of Lenin's seed. At the time he never used such an epithet to characterize Stalin. Concerning the much more difficult ques- tion of the relationship between Marxism and Leninism, Kolakowski offers an ambiguous and highly qualified answer. On his reading, the Leninist version of socialism in theory and practice is a possible interpretation of Marx, although certainly not the only pos- sible one. But if Leninism is a legitimate pos- sible interpretation of Marx, that is indeed a devastating judgment. For what he is really saying is that the historically unprecedented system of totalitarianism which Lenin ush- ered into the world is implicit in Marx's basic ideas and ideals. But if the conception of a truly democratic socialist society is also im- plicit in Marx, as Kolakowski acknowledges, then Marx's social and political writings must be considered basically incoherent. Kolakowski, it seems to me, goes astray here. Although he notes Lenin's lack of fidel- ity to the Marxist tradition in his early advo- cacy of an alliance between the working class and the peasantry, and in his exploitation of nationalism as integral to the strategy of the conquest of power, he does not sufficiently stress the chief difference between Marx and Lenin. This is to be found in Lenin's identifi- cation of "the dictatorship of the proletariat" (a phrase used twice by Marx to characterize the economic impact of a socialist state) with "the dictatorship of the party," which is liter- ally a dictatorship over the proletariat and everyone else. That identification proved to be the poisoned premise from which all the multiple tyrannies of the Soviet Union flowed - and there is not a line in the enormous corpus of Marx's work that war- rants attributing this view to Marx himself. If anything, Marx erred in his emphasis on the spontaneity of the working-class revolution- ary movement, affirming and reaffirming that the emancipation of the working class can be achieved only by that class itself. No exegesis of Marx's statement about Communists serv- ing as a "vanguard" of the working class can be used as a source of Lenin's theory of the party. In 1904, before Trotsky became a Le- ninist, he denounced that theory in words which are uncannily appropriate for the dic- tatorship of the Politburo and the dictator- ship of Stalin. After all, the government of the Paris Commune - to which Marx pointed as illustrating what he meant by "the dicta- torship of the proletariat" - was a coalition of many political tendencies in which no party exercised a dictatorship and in which Marx's own political faction was not officially repre- 268</page><page sequence="10">BOOKS sented. Before he died, Marx, like Engels, ad- mitted that the dictatorship of the proletariat could be brought into being through the dem- ocratic parliamentary process. IV One can say with reasonable confidence that as scholars come to grips with Kola- kowski's three massive volumes they will find little to take issue with in more than two thirds of the work: the second and third vol- umes. It is with Kolakowski's treatment of Marx that major difficulties can be raised, and these involve his assumption that there is no essential difference between the early Marx and the Marx of his major published writings. There are enormous difficulties in this view, which cannot be overcome by pointing out some linguistic continuities between the young and the mature Marx. The crucial question is, When did Marx become a "Marx- ist"? Until the Economic and Philosophic manuscripts were published, the almost uni- versal answer was that he became a Marxist when he promulgated the theory of historical materialism. This doctrine and its corollaries are completely at odds with the Feuer- bachian and "true socialist" standpoint of the manuscripts. The whole doctrine of "self- alienation" presupposes logically an essential and perduring self from which man can be alienated - a notion foreign to both Hegel and Marx and, when it was taken over by French socialists, Marx characterized it in the Communist Manifesto as "metaphysical rub- bish." The question is of more than biograph- ical interest; depending upon how one an- swers it, Marx will be considered either a muddleheaded philosopher or a pioneering scientific sociologist. A second major difficulty in Kolakowski's exposition of Marx is his view that the devel- opment of the forces of production, or tech- nology in its broad sense, is the driving force of history. "The message of historical materi- alism would seem to be that a given tech- nology is a sufficient cause of particular rela- tions of production provided certain other conditions of geography or demography are present."

This view is not only in- compatible with Marx's texts, except where he is using metaphors, but runs counter to the central notion of the relations of production and their organic development, in which technology plays a role. Whether a tech- nology is used and how it is used depends upon the state of the relations of production. Once isolated as the basic variable in social change, as Kolakowski understands it, the same technology may be found in two differ- ent social systems - that is, systems with dif- ferent relations of production. In this sense, slaves liberated from slavery can still employ the same technology as freemen, just as in many respects the technology of the U.S. and the USSR today is the same. Here the older Marxist schools were justified in stressing the mode or relations of economic production as the basis of social organization and develop- ment. (It is even reflected in Lenin's odd defi- nition of communism as "Soviets plus elec- trification," where the term "Soviets" refers in the historic context to a new, collectivist mode of production.) Further, behind every technological development is an idea. It has been argued that the industrial revolution is primarily a scientific revolution. Before long, the technological interpretation of history now put forward to explicate the material- istic interpretation of history is transformed into the traditional idealistic interpretation that Marx explicitly rejected. The obvious re- tort to this is that ideas, especially when ap- plied, do not develop in a historical vacuum. They are always found in a social context. They are inspired by social needs. Even when they modify, they fit into the net of social re- lations or the dominant mode of economic production. The third and most questionable of Kola- kowski's positions is his conception of Marx's theory of knowledge. He correctly divines that Marx rejects the contemplative theory of knowledge for a view that makes knowing an activity, a form of practice that must leave the world somewhat altered. But the charac- ter of that practice is rather mystifying be- cause of Kolakowski 's tendency to identify the activity with revolutionary action - though obviously not all knowledge is related to revolutionary practice. Sometimes he iden- tifies Marx's theory of knowledge with knowl- edge of social and historical affairs, solving the problem of how we can predict events that we try to influence or bring about. "The act of foreseeing coincides with the act of effecting what is foreseen; the proletariat knows the future in the act of creating it, not after the fashion of a weather forecaster when the changes that actually happen are unaf- fected by anything the forecaster can do." This is a form of magical idealism. Even in social affairs many events can - in the short run, at least - be foreseen but cannot be ef- fected, certainly not by the proletariat. Con- sidered as a general theory of knowledge, the whole view runs into absurdity in the claim that "cognition signifies taking posses- sion of the world in a process of revolutionary changes" - as if knowing something were like eating it, as if all processes of change were revolutionary, and as if Marx were pro- claiming truths about social development that could be valid only for the proletariat. Another conception of knowledge sug- gested by Marx's fragmentary comments is ig- nored by Kolakowski: this view recognizes that an element of activity or praxis enters into every instance of knowledge - from truths of perception to truths about the world, physical or social, outside us. In this view all reliable or tested knowledge involves praxis, not as something practical or useful, but as an activity comparable to what is done in an experiment and one which always in- volves interaction between the knower and the field he is cognitively exploring. In this sense it entails a rearrangement of the field. We do not learn merely by opening our eyes but by doing, though not all doing is learning. Knowing changes the world in some way, so we may read conclusions that test the antici- pated consequences of that change. This does not mean that we change the moon when we learn something about it; it means that to learn something about the moon (or about any other object), we must do something to elements in the field even if we only alter the position of our bodies. Such activity will vary with different disciplines and with different problems, but if knowledge is won, it will be valid independent of who or what class knows it. This theory of knowledge is embryonic in Marx and is incompatible with Engels's crude view that our ideas are images or copies of things, and therefore objects of knowledge 270</page><page sequence="12">BOOKS that serve as a screen between things and their knowers. The theory is more plausible than Lukács's reading of Marx and, despite its internal difficulties, closer to Marx's natural- istic outlook. Regardless of the validity of one or another interpretation of Marx, it is clear that Marx's contributions, in whatever modified form, have entered the consciousness of our time, affected the idiom of our language and under- standing, and left an ineradicable imprint on the world of scholarship. All this is hardly suf- ficient to justify anyone's calling himself a Marxist unless he wishes to break out a flag of political allegiance. Just as no scientific biolo- gist, in discussing the genetic aspects of evo- lution, would call himself a Darwinian today, so no scientific sociologist, if he were con- cerned only with the truth of his statements, would call himself a Marxist. Even with re- spect to those scholars who avow Marxism in order to declare their political faith, the spec- trum of their beliefs runs from some forms of Leninism to a Third World tribal Maoism. The only thing one can be certain about is their unalterable hostility to the democratic welfare state of the Western world, especially of the United States.</page></plain_text>
