<plain_text><page sequence="1">FALLS OF DESIRE / LEAPS OF FAITH: RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM IN LOUISE ERDRICH'S AND JOY HARJO'S "MIXED-BOOD" POETRY Sheila Hassell Hughes Syncretism has generally been seen by the dominant strains of Chris- tianity as a corruption, or "fall" from the one true faith. In contrast to the inclusive and adaptive impulses of many Native cultures, in particular, the North American Church has historically tended to resist significant trans- formation by traditional tribal beliefs and practices, even when such closure threatens its own viability. Achiel Peelman's study of the presence and possibility of Christ "inculturated" among First Nations in Canada and the U.S. therefore represents an important response, by a contempo- rary non-Native theologian, to the inter-religious history, practice, and theology of Native peoples. Peelman insists, as will I, that a reciprocal transformation of traditions is both possible and necessary.1 The Church today is still quite resistant to transformation by forces it sees as "foreign," of course, but it may be possible to uncover potential sources of theologi- cal revision from the "borderlands" of Christianity by smudging the line between "inside" and "outside." 2 In this essay, then, I intend to explore religious syncretism as a kind of border practice engaged in by those who situate themselves in multiple traditions and/or in the margins between them. Peelman introduces a range of terms for different kinds and degrees of religious mixing, but his definition of syncretism - as the fusion of two belief systems "to form a third, new reality" (66) - comes closest to the kind of radically transforma- tive and reciprocal practices I am interested in. Rather than thinking of syncretists as those who cross cultural lines to raid, trade with, or borrow from other religions and then retreat to their own worlds to adapt or re- invent their imports, I am concerned with those who are themselves border-dwellers, invested and implicated in multiple spheres of belief and practice. This study therefore focuses on "mixed-blood" writers - those R&amp;L 33.2 (Summer 2001) 59</page><page sequence="2">60 Religion &amp; Literature whose familial and cultural heritage includes both Native and Euro- American lines - because they typically inhabit this kind of space. This essay also imagines poetry as a kind of "borderland" for theological reflection. While not canonized as officially sacred texts, poems, like songs and prayers, have long found a place in Christian tradition. And in recent years theologians - especially feminists - have turned increasingly to secu- lar literature for inspiration and exemplification. Suspended between truth and lie, history and timelessness, imaginative literature opens new spaces for creative and constructive theological reflection. The "mixed- blood" poet, then, promises to be a doubly vital source for this exploration. Because Louise Erdrich and Joy Harjo exhibit a religious syncretism in their works that demonstrates not only a traditional Native approach to integration but also a specifically Christian reciprocation of that impulse, they provide particularly fruitful texts through which to consider the possibilities of mutual transformation. Through poetic imagination and linguistic play, Erdrich and Harjo create a "third space" for religious experience - and expose points of contact from which to transform both Catholic and Protestant theologies in North America. And in doing so, they unsettle radical oppositions both within Christianity and between it and tribal religions, turning these differences into what Native theologian George Tinker calls "reciprocal dualisms" ("Spirituality" 122-23). Specifi- cally, each poet reveals the inherent conflicts in the Christian system she engages and, in the syncretic process, transforms that dichotomy into a productive and reciprocal relationship. Each also does this in ways that highlight the feminine face of God. The blurring of borders - between inside and outside, sacred and secu- lar, human and nature, self and other - triggers a "fall" into a state of mutual need. And, for both poets, this "fall" is not ultimately a degenera- tion but, rather, a transformative leap of faith. Erdrich addresses Catholic asceticism and sacramentalism in her 1989 collection, Baptism of Desire. While the poems reveal a tension between natural needs and spiritual desires, between the fallen and earth-bound body and the transcendent ascent of the soul, ultimately these forces and directions are integrated rather than opposed in the poetry. Through her title image, perhaps most of all, the poet manages to hold together both essential denial and sheer celebration, ultimate need and utter fulfillment. By insisting on both the ascetic and sacramental Catholic traditions simultaneously, Erdrich opens the door to a more traditionally tribal view of the spiritual reality and mutually regenerative power of the earth and the body - a view which also has specifically feminist implications. Harjo's work, on the other</page><page sequence="3">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 6 1 hand, engages the Protestant emphasis on Word and Spirit. But by relying on a tribal and oral understanding of the relationship between the two terms, she, like Erdrich, brings nature and the body into play in order to expose and unsettle a potential theological conflict. Asserting that the same (feminine) spirit inspires both oral and written, tribal and biblical, religious expression, Harjo appeals to but also challenges Protestant doc- trines in ways that enrich the paradoxes of Christian faith. The poems of Erdrich's which engage Christian tradition most explic- itly can be found in the first part of her second collection, Baptism of Desire. From these pages emerge modern and medieval saints and doubters, the Christian Savior and his trickster twin, the Magnificat and the Magdalene. But just as the larger volume of poetry balances the poet's European and Objibwe heritages (the Mary Kroger and the Potchikoo series, for in- stance), so too these explicitly Catholic voices and visions are informed - and transformed - by a Native perspective and "traditional" religion.3 And what all of these poems emphasize in some way or another is the essential changeability and multiplicity of both physical and spiritual reality. They suggest, in turn, that flexibility and adaptability determine the viability of any religious form - regardless of origin or tradition. The four poems in the "Saint Clare" series (5-10) explore the possibili- ties of self-transformation through celibacy and other forms of asceticism in the Catholic tradition. But the focus here is not simply on a change from a material to a spiritual reality. Rather, spiritual power is realized in the profound connections among cohabitants of the material realm. Tran- scendence, then, is experienced along a horizontal trajectory as much as a vertical one, and God is immanent in our mutual desire and need. Specifically, in a number of these poems, there is the suggestion of inter-species transformation. From a Native perspective, which empha- sizes ultimate and endless "relation" among all elements of life, such metamorphoses are actually quite natural. Harjo suggests that the hierar- chical vision of creation most often promoted by Christianity - in which humans are the pinnacle of physical form - makes it difficult to grasp this concept, and explains that "ft] he shape is a spiral in which all beings resonate. The bear is one version of human and vice versa. The human is not above the bear, nor is Adam naming the bear." Her summary is particularly cogent: "Transformation is really about understanding the shape and condition of another with compassion, not about overtaking" (qtd. in Ruwe 60; emphasis mine). Because all matter is dynamic and sacred - and "God ... is a relative . . . [who] lives at the roots of molecular structure in all life ..." (59), changes in mind can trigger changes in body. This is the</page><page sequence="4">62 Religion &amp; Literature tribal balance, or answer, perhaps, to the Catholic mystical belief that discipline of the body can reshape the soul. In addition to obvious transformations, such as Clare's metamorphosis from girl, to fish, to saint in "The Call," there are more subtle re-configu- rations of Christian images of sanctification in this series of poems. If, for example, we understand Clare's vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience as a kind of death necessary to spiritual rebirth, then we can see in the dispersal of her bodice ornamentation and then of her very hair (in "Before") a distinct vision of the body's relation to the rest of creation.4 Rather than emphasizing a Christian ascetic mortification or degradation of the body that awaits a final, postponed resurrection or flight to an other-worldly heaven, the butterflies and birds suggest something closer to a Native vision, in which, after death, the disembodied spirit is "every- where and pervades all nature" (Eastman 156). The afterlife, in this worldview, is not so much a release and separation from the created order, but a broader integration with it. It is fitting, then, that birds become Clare's spiritual offspring in the third poem. Much as the wren weaves her nest of human hair, grass, and "silken tassels at the ends of seeds," the poem "My Life as a Saint" itself integrates multifarious sources. The nest serves as the central symbol and site of religious integration in the poem. From her window, Clare tells us, she watches the birds at work, weaving their nest. That they are "house wrens" perhaps suggests a potential for domestication, at least imaginatively: associated with the patriarchal house and nesting place she has abandoned in favor of the convent, they stand in for the productive maternal figure Clare has elected not to become. "Then," she observes, "the cup was made fast / to the body of the tree." Here a domestic utensil represents the natural nest, but the metaphoric substitution also suggests a coinci- dence between the nest and the eucharistic cup - a reference solidified by the terms "made fast," "body," and "tree," which together invoke the crucifixion. The Plains Indians' practice of tree-burial (Eastman 152) adds further richness to the image. The tree is also, of course, the tree of life - emblem of creation and eternity in both Christian and Native sym- bolic systems.5 That the cup is bound to the tree "with the silver excresence of the spider" is also important. More than just a symbol for natural productivity, or even a feminist emblem of relationality, the appearance of the spider signals an increasingly pan-tribal understanding of first creation and [our] on-going role in it. Spider-woman is, as Paula Gunn Allen explains, the grandmother who spins creation into being by her own thought, and her daughters are those - poets, storytellers, bearers of cul-</page><page sequence="5">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 63 ture - who continually re-weave the web of oral tradition {Sacred 1 3). That the eggs held in the nest are "four in number" is another Native symbol: four being the most sacred number in many tribal systems. As interesting as these layers of imagistic syncretism are to uncover, they are but clues to the more profoundly theological implications of Erdrich's poem. The nest woven of both natural and spiritual, Christian and Native, tissues, serves as the necessary "third space" or "borderland" from and in which to transform the Christian God and his relation to creation. As the book's title, Baptism of Desire, subtly suggests,6 it is hunger - and even the threat of death - that the four hatchlings are born into. Observing each tiny beak spring open, "tongue erect, / screaming to be fed" before the rest of its body has even emerged from the shell, Clare now begins to understand the shape and condition of the bird. While she cannot regurgitate her own food to feed the baby birds from her mouth, as a wren would, she does the next best thing: "I did not eat. I smashed my bread to crumbs upon the sill," she explains. Recognizing birth as an entrance into desire and need, Clare willingly takes on a new hunger for the ascetic transfor- mation of her own body and soul, but also in service as nursemaid to the offspring of another. She identifies not only with the hunger of the infants, but also with the impossible responsibilities of maternity. And, in this identification with the mother bird, she also suggests her identification with God: "for the parents were weary as God is weary. / We have the least mercy on the one / who created us, / who introduced us to this hunger" (7). Maternity thus functions as a complex and anti-sentimental model for God in the poem because creation appears here - as in the whole vol- ume - always to imply a need or absence. Clare's offering up of her own bread for the infant birds is a eucharistic sacrifice by which she identifies with God, while also serving as surrogate for a mother too tired to feed her own. Christ-like, she mediates between incomprehensible creator and demanding creature, even going so far as to bury the chick she could not keep alive when "The smallest mouth starved and the mother / swept it out like rubbish with her wing." If God is to be understood in feminine terms, then - as the mother bird of Matthew's gospel (23:37), gathering her chicks under her wings - she is nonetheless not the idealized maternal figure of Church tradition or of some romantic feminist refigurations. God apparently is a creator who introduces her children to needs she cannot fill. So, as Clare takes responsibility for sustaining creation, she suggests that the saint's role is to pick up where the original creator-mother leaves off, demarcating the bearing and raising of young in such a way as to undermine biological determinism (for both</page><page sequence="6">64 Religion &amp; Literature gender and species). This exercise of responsibility across lines of species is one that a Native view of creation as on-going, active, collaborative, and non-hierarchical in fact requires. Clare, whose celibacy is symbolized by the newly empty nest - "the small brown begging bowl, / waiting to be filled" - identifies again with the mother/creator in her loss of young, but she willingly shapes "an emptiness within" herself that she "make[s] lovely / as the immature birds make the air by defining the tunnels and the spirals / of the new suste- nance" and "fling themselves / deep into the world." So her rejection of physical reproduction becomes another kind of production, by which she fashions a new world within herself. She remains focused on this inner space, tied to the nest, bowl, and convent, unlike the birds who are "no longer hindered by the violence of their need." Her need is that of the creator, rather than the creature, at this point. But her asceticism - a sort of practice common to both Christianity and Native American religions7 - is not meant to cut her off from the natural and physical realm in quest of the spiritual. Her celibacy is not so much a rejection of female (and) physical creativity, as a broader embrace of it in all spheres, and it is achieved only through a radical identification with other elements of nature. That "the kingdom is within" means here that Clare finds it within this world, and within her own body. Having transformed herself into mother bird, with her own internal nest, she understands the shape and condition of what it means to create and let loose from out of herself, and so comes closer to experiencing the shape and condition of God. This sexual asceticism, then, actually involves a celebration, rather than a rejection, of the female body. Indeed, as nest, Clare's body becomes a kind of sacra- ment in itself. In the process of Clare's identification and transformation, the Chris- tian God also undergoes a degree of transformation. Readers expecting either a traditional orthodox representation of God the Father of saints, or an outright rejection of the Euro-Christian deity, find neither. Just as in the response of Native peoples upon initial contact, Erdrich's answer to Christianity here is neither a "simple yes or no" (Peelman 61). Her representational integration of traditions effects a change in God, from triumphalism to weariness. God, here, is an exhausted mother who depends upon us to uphold our own role in and responsibility for the ongoing work of creating and sustaining all being. This theological shift is not far removed from what some contemporary Native scholars are trying to achieve in their challenges to the conquest tradition of Christianity. William Baldridge, for example, reflects on the</page><page sequence="7">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 65 Israelite conquest of the Canaanites in the Hebrew Bible, and relates it to the Canaanite woman's radical challenge to Jesus in the Gospel of Mat- thew (15:2 1-28). He concludes that there is biblical precedence for "[t]he son of the god of Canaanite oppression [to] repent," and asserts, there- fore, that "[i]f we Canaanites live out our faith, we can change the very heart of God" ("Response" 101). Reclaiming and reinterpreting biblical narrative becomes, for such Native theologians, a means of changing the heart of the colonizer's God - and, in turn, for transforming the Church and its relationship to those who stand at its margins. Imagining the Christian God in terms of need, dependence, and metamorphosis, Erdrich's poem likewise speaks a demanding yes and a resisting no to ecclesial tradition. Just as Erdrich weaves a sacramental vision into images of asceticism in "My Life as a Saint," so, in poems which focus on the sacraments, she also explores the role of self-denial and mutual suffering. The tree of life - axis of the cosmos and emblem of creative sacrifice - appears in the ritual of the sun dance, now a pan-tribal element of Native American religious practice. And so it is with this ritual that Erdrich begins another series of poems, "The Sacraments" (18-24). In this section of Baptism of Desire, the inter-religious integration at work is both more clearly announced and less self-evident than in the Saint Clare series. A list of the seven Roman Catholic sacraments - Baptism, Communion, Confirmation, Matrimony, Penance, Holy Orders, and Extreme Unction - follows the title and pre- cedes the seven numbered poems, which appear to correspond sequen- tially. With the exception of a prayer to a blue-eyed plaster statue in the sixth, however, there is no explicitly Christian symbolism or reference in any of these poems. It is only the framing elements that suggest the significance for Christianity of the first poem, which begins with "the sun dancers, in their helmets of sage" (18). The poet presents the sun dance as a sacrament corresponding to Christian baptism, but neither ritual is quite a metaphor for the other. In fact, both ultimately serve as signs of the ongoing spiritual reality of instability and transformation, and their inter- section in the poem marks a third space, margin, or borderland for the perception of that reality. The sun dance may well be as important to tribal religion today - and as varied in its expressions - as baptism is to Christianity. According to Peelman, because the sun dance ritual, which first appeared among Plains Indians in the Eighteenth Century, "incarnate [s] practically all the major aspects of Amerindian spirituality," it has been especially conducive to pan-Indian adoption. Serving liturgically as "the very centre of ... their</page><page sequence="8">66 Religion &amp; Literature sacred space and time," it incorporates a range of Native symbols, includ- ing "the circle, the medicine wheel, the tree of life, the sacred pipe, and the four directions" (2 1 2). There are variations among different Native peoples, but the basic ritual requires that those who have committed themselves to self-sacrifice on behalf of the community dance all day around the central pole (a sacred tree which has been felled and stripped for this purpose), to the point of exhaustion. In some tribes, they apparently gaze at the sun while dancing. Through song and prayer, the community supports the dancers as they carry out this "elaborate form of the vision quest" on behalf of the group (212-14). In the poem's first stanza, then, we encounter the ceremonial dancers at this point of intensity and exhaustion, "as [they are] stopped at the sun's apogee / [standing] in the waterless light." The adjective here not only emphasizes the intensity and dry heat of the sun, but also checks any expectations of baptismal water imagery we might bring to the poem. What we find instead of watery sprinkling or immersion is a reference to sacrificed flesh - something we would more likely anticipate in the poem corresponding to communion. In fact, it is only in the latter poem that images of rebirth out of water appear at all, so the imagery and themes appear to be reversed. On a first reading, therefore, one might question whether the sequence of poems corresponds to the list of sacraments at all, because Erdrich deliberately plays against Christian theological expec- tations in each of the poems. The poet also plays against formal expectations. After the third-person introduction of the sun dancers in the first three lines, the poem appears to take a turn, as the dancers become an analogy for some less identifiable act of sacrifice on the part of the speaker. The stanza continues, "so, after loss, it came to this: / that for each year the being was destroyed, / I was to sacrifice a piece of my flesh. / The keen knife hovered / And the skin flicked in the bowl. / Then the sun, the life that consumes us, / burst into agony." The analogical "As ... so ..." structure indicates that the speaker here is not herself a sun dancer, but that her unspecified act of sacrifice is like the ceremonial one: sacred and essential. The "being" whose destruc- tion or erosion prompts the sacrifice is obscure, but the absence of per- sonal pronouns suggests something larger than, if not apart from, the speaker herself. Perhaps it is "being" itself. And if the universe is a living thing, and "being" is commensurate with the universe, then this "life that consumes us" is renewed by such ceremonial acts. It is only when the "skin flicked in the bowl," after all, that "the sun .../ burst into agony." The sun is to be reborn, a new cycle of creation to begin, and the individual's</page><page sequence="9">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 67 suffering to become a meaningful part of the larger pattern of rebirth - a kind of cosmic baptism, perhaps. The speaker's consumption by and consummation with the sun/life corresponds to a baptismal submersion, indicating her own transformation and eventual emergence. Here is another point where Erdrich's syncretic images offer to trans- form Christian theology. Just as the universe continues in cycles of creation and destruction, so the individual, Vine Deloria explains, is part of that same pattern: "The meaning of history is not that we are saved from it but that we participate in it. Thus our own demise is not a real catastrophe but a fulfillment of larger cosmic meaning" ("Christianity" 34). Could this understanding of a participatory demise become a meaning of baptism? The connection between this understanding of the universe, centered symbolically in the sun along the axis of the sacred dance, and the Christian ritual of symbolic death and rebirth, is surely the foundation for Erdrich's poem. But, of course, Christianity has not often promoted cosmic and carnal responsibility as essential to baptismal vows, and Deloria's suggestion that "the Christian universe is dead, except for man" (33), has probably too often been true.8 Perhaps, then, Erdrich's poem is not simply about finding a Native parallel for the Christian sacrament (or vice versa) - to set up an informative or enlightening analogy - but also to achieve a transformative integration by which the Christian ritual of baptism be- comes something new. We might even see the poem as a radical baptism of the sacrament itself. If so, it suggests the kind of "Native American witness to Christianity" called for by Native theologians Paul Schultz and George Tinker (67). It extends the application of the oft-quoted gospel verse, "For God so loved the world" (John 3: 16), to emphasize God's grace to all of creation9 and, with its vision of our radical inseparability from the natural realm, it might just offer one step towards Baldridge's vision that "it is now time for [Native peoples] to save the missionaries" ("Reclaim- ing" 89) from their destructive insistence upon separate absolutes. While the poem's first stanza sets up the analogy between the sacrifice of the dancers and the individual speaker, in the second stanza the relation changes into something more direct and material. Just as Clare metamorphosizes into fish or bird in the "Saint Clare" poems, so the speaker becomes a sun dancer here. "We began," the first lines describe, "the wands and bracelets of sage, / the feathers cocked over our ears." The bird that appears in the following lines is explicitly female, and, if lacking any suggestion of domesticity, still bears some resemblance to the inscrutable mother wren in "My Life as a Saint." She may be the spirit alighting, as in the dove at Jesus' baptism, but she is more wild and violent</page><page sequence="10">68 Religion &amp; Literature than most Christian imagery. And she is not merely a symbol or icon, but the material embodiment of the Spirit. Joining the circle, perhaps because the dancers themselves have adopted the adornment of feathers, and so understand the shape and condition of the bird , she calls to the dancers. They "cried back" in response, and then "Her wings closed over us, her dark red / claws drew us upward by the scars, / so that we hung by the flesh." The scarification of the dancers becomes the point of physical contact, and the bird's swooping down to catch them up in her claws suggests the act of a predator. Spirit and dancers are locked in the symbiosis of hunter and prey. In Native practice and perspective, such a relationship depends upon mutual need and respect, and the hunter identifies with the animal who has sacrificed itself on his behalf. He might wear its skin to symbolize this grateful identification, and the life of the consumed creature is understood to resonate and remain in those who partake. In the poem, nature's sacrifice is reciprocated, with the dancers offering themselves up for the rejuvenation of the sun/spirit. They are drawn up by the bird, who is the hovering and enclosing mother/spirit, and who becomes one with the sacred pole itself, the center from which the flesh of the dancers hangs. Of course, this imagery suggests crucifixion as well, multiplying the signifiers of sacrifice. In the third and final stanza, the poet introduces another analogy, and so shifts the axis of the poem one more time. The dancers (the "we" of the second stanza) hang, "as in the moment before birth / when the spirit is quenched / in whole pain, suspended / until there is no choice, the body / slams to earth / the new life starts." Not only does the sun dance function here as a symbol for death and rebirth, but birth (perhaps even the spiritual re-birth of the individual in baptism) also serves to help under- stand the dance itself. The pattern of signification is neither linear nor unidirectional, then, but cyclical and reciprocal. The individual is con- sumed and subsumed by the sun, transformed by her sacrifice and incor- porated into a communal dance, and then joined by and caught up in the spirit-bird-mother. Birth, in the final line, is the beginning of "the new life" - a body emerging, individuating, and falling from the all-encompass- ing and suspending labor of the mother, whose own body is still one with her child in the pre-delivery moment of "whole pain." Birth, then, marks the beginning of the mother's needs as well. Indeed, Erdrich's work suggests that any act of creation makes a dependent creator . . . and if cosmic creation is mutual, then universal interdependency is inevitable.</page><page sequence="11">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 69 The "whole pain" that precedes birth now divides, and the new life emerges into desire for re-union. From a Native perspective, however, the loss of the mother that occurs at birth is never entire, because every loss is always part of a larger cycle of destruction and regeneration. The division of the maternal body in birth, then, becomes a model for the reciprocal dualism of baptism. The phrase "when the spirit is quenched" suggests that this creation/birth is a kind of baptism in multiple ways. First, the word "[qjuenched" gives us our only water image in the poem, and serves as an interesting correlative for the "waterless light" that marks the danc- ers' moment of symbolic death. The reference to "spirit" might also indicate that this is a spiritual birth or re-birth. There is, as well, a biblical directive against "quench [ing] the spirit." Paul warns the Church not to put out the spirit's fire by treating prophesy with contempt, but instead to "test everything" (I Thessalonians 5: 19-2 la). When the maternal water has broken, and the new life yet to emerge, we might conclude, the fire/ sun/spirit is quenched, submerged and suspended. It is a sacrificial moment, a moment of testing and, in this poem, a state of painful identification ripe for spiritual contact, vision or prophesy. But if the body does not then "slam ... to earth," the sun that consumes cannot itself be reborn and "burst into agony," into life as a state of desire and mutual need. If the "Sun Dance dramatically re-creates the sacramentality of the entire universe," as Peelman suggests (215), it does so in Erdrich's poem by recreating the sacrament of baptism. Baptism is quenched in the sun dance, to be reborn as a vision of the radical inseparability of the material and spiritual, the individual and the cosmic, the human and the non- human. Christianity is not translated into the Native tongue, and the Native is not converted to Christian. Rather, as suggested by Peelman, the "center" of Christianity - the cross of Christ and baptism - is "inculturated" in another "world" here. And it is accomplished on that world's own terms and according to its own sacred time and space. This is not a re-interpretation of Western Christianity. Rather, it is a response to missionization - and even to Christian imperialism - that is "unique and original . . . transcending] the expectations of the missionaries and objectives of their churches" (Peelman 82). And if it qualifies as what Peelman calls an "Amerindian integration of] the Christian message in their own cultural universe" (67), it might just suspend and transform the meaning of that message beyond what the Church has ever imagined before. The "life [which] starts" at the poem's conclusion is, after all, wholly "new."</page><page sequence="12">70 Religion &amp; Literature As in Erdrich's poetry, "need" is both the nature of being and hope of connection for Joy Harjo. Mutual desire - the effect as well as prompt for creativity, and the felt experience of reciprocal dualism - is what holds the cosmos together, and is that to which transformative acts of song and prayer give articulation. Erdrich's use of the nest, tree, womb, and dance as sites of intersecting realities spatialize the work of transformation which, in Christian tradition, has more often been figured in temporal terms (e.g. sanctification over time). Harjo's work further intensifies the spatial element - turning even music and the word into spatial realities. Hers is not a Western re-configuration and preservation of the oral into inert text, however. Rather, it is the penetrable qualities of sound - as integrative acts of gathering across space - that Harjo celebrates. Like the nest and dance, song and prayer collect and integrate the here and there, holding disparate worlds together in transforming paradox. And, like Erdrich, Harjo's view of creation as cyclical and mutual is key to her engagement with Christianity. In part because the Christian belief and practice of Harjo's grandpar- ents was Protestant, her work more directly addresses the Bible and the Holy Spirit, in contrast to Erdrich's ascetic and sacramental interests. Harjo's celebration of the word resembles the approach of some Native theologians, especially when she suggests that the oral tradition of Native peoples - the "stories, . . . songs, rituals and ceremonies that celebrate and praise God as well as instill ... an awe of the mystery of life" - constitute a "bible" ("Song" 419). She is certainly less clearly Christian in her approach than those who have concluded that Native oral tradition oper- ates as a unique and supplemental "Old Testament" or "Native Cov- enant" that, like the Hebrew Bible, is fulfilled in Christ (McKay 52; Charleston 75). But her insistence that the sacredness of any "bible" is specific "to the peoples it was given to, to a particular shape and spirit of land and language"(4 19-20) echoes their concern that the Hebrew and Christian testaments be dialogized and contextualized by the history and realities of this continent. As Native Christians do, Harjo grants divine inspiration to the Bible, while insisting that her people, "The Creeks (or Muscogees) already had a spiritual path laid down in the very beginning, given by the same Creator" (419). She asserts that the same spirit breathes life into both Christian and tribal spirituality, but she also stresses the importance of continuity with one's origins. Acknowledging her own people's geographical displace- ment from the southeast to Oklahoma, she asks, "How do you rebuild in a place far from home, when your records are etched in the land and skies of</page><page sequence="13">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 7 1 another land?" The answer of some Creeks was, apparently, to adopt a new text and tradition to grant meaning to the new place: "For some," Harjo interprets, "Christianity became a refuge, another way to under- stand the sacred that perhaps masked the loss. They found ways to incorporate Christianity, for ultimately, without the fundamentalism and agenda of the colonizers, the Bible allowed another way to speak of the sacred" ("Song" 42 1). Those who brought the Bible to the Muscogee were evidently more concerned with maintaining religious purity than were the Indians, for they drew a line of separation between those who took to the Bible and the traditionalists, where the people themselves apparently saw no absolute division (421). Harjo, who claims both "the rhythms of speaking and singing from the Bible" and "the current of the powwow drum, and turtle shells shaking" (432), situates herself on this line or border. Recognizing the productivity and possibility of the biblical word as distinct from the limitations put on speech by Christian institutions and practices, she finds power in the word because it is paradoxical and multivocal. Although the sacred text or tradition is in some senses specific to the location of its production, and requires attention to context to safeguard its power and proper use (420), it also speaks more (para-dox) than can be contained by any one site or position. And this excess is necessary for continuance because survival requires adaptation and innovation. For Harjo, then, the Bible itself offers a marginal site from which to expose the porous borders of Christianity and prompt its transformation. The reality of the unspoken and unseen are particularly important to Harjo, and for her it is in liminal spaces and ecstatic moments that these become perceptible. As a child, Harjo encountered what she calls "the unspoken Bible": "stories and songs that were never spoken, because there was no place for them within the context of colonization in Oklahoma in the 1950s and later 1960s. Even the Bible had forbidden parts," she concludes, "and other paradoxes of meaning" that provided points of entry or contact between worlds. "As a child of two cultures (or more precisely three and more)," she continues, "my belief system had to embody paradox or it would not be useful for navigating through this life" ("Song" 424). From youth, she also had various kinds of non-rational knowledge (such as visions and dreams), and so found herself identifying with biblical figures whose spiritual experience transcended the purely rational and material - such as Jacob wrestling the angel (425). The biblical word thus represents more than the pure reason that the Western concept of "logos" might suggest. It is, primarily, spirit, giving breath to new and on^oine articulations of the sacred.</page><page sequence="14">72 Religion &amp; Literature This emphasis on paradox and spirit leaves the poet free to question "the letter of the law" from the border of religious traditions. Like Erdrich, her focus is on the material reality of the sacred. Indeed, both poets celebrate the body - and especially the female body - as a source of both need and fulfillment and, therefore, as a model of connection and, ultimately, of the sacred itself. If sensuality is a sin, she asks in her meditation on the biblical Song of Solomon, "Then why did God create us / to enjoy ourselves and each other / as representatives of God's / body, for aren't we the sons / and daughters of God?" The poet relies here not only on the official and written word for her challenge, but also on creation itself - which has always been recognized as a means of divine revelation by Christians, if less enthusiastically in Protestant traditions. Like Erdrich, she looks to the sensual interactions of all animate life - noting how even "the spring grass enjoy [ed]/ the little winds sliding through it." Of all life, including humans, she concludes, "We crave the comfort / of the song we make / with each other" ("Song" 426). This craving, which is and is for song, is Harjo's point of entry to the Bible itself. And it is much like Erdrich 's "desire." In fact, these lines from "Song of Solomon" resonate profoundly with the second poem in Erdrich's "Sacra- ments" series, on communion, in which frogs pull themselves to the water's surface to "sound one clear unceasing note of need." The speaker herself is caught up in the frogs' song, and sinks to her knees to bear witness to "the ravenous trill / of the body transformed at last and then consumed / in a rush of music." She concludes by calling back to the frogs, "Sing to me, sing to me" (BD 19). For both poets, that which stirs us to sing is the song of transformation working in us, as we come into our own sensual desires. "This urge / is born within each / human," Harjo writes, "at the transformation of becoming / woman from girl / or man from boy" (427). Desire for an other is not reduced here to a merely human or heterosexual vision of fulfillment by Harjo, though. The adolescent stirring is "similar to the corn / learning to sing as it grows / to the sky," she asserts, and at no point is the "beloved" for whom the speaker longs identified in gendered terms. The difference that is important here is not an absolute and inalterable gender opposition, but an internalized and transformative possibility - "this thing / that was turning me inside out." This is the reciprocal duality described by Tinker. "The architectural geography of [Native] spirituality," in which, above and below, sky and earth, are understood in mutual, interdepen- dent, and egalitarian terms, he explains, means that the incorporation of difference serves both a political function (group cohesion) and a spiritual</page><page sequence="15">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 73 one (the recognition that combination and struggle are necessary for balance) (Tinker 1 22-3). Longing for, and identification with, "each other," this poem therefore suggests, effects a balancing material and spiritual metamorphosis in each one: "the fire changing us / from stone, to animal to human animal / to spirit" (427). This is where Harjo comes closest to Erdrich's practice of integrating Native and Christian rituals or sacraments. The images of fire and stone suggest the sweat lodge or vapor bath, a ceremony by which one can achieve a new spiritual state and receive sacred visions. Baptism or communion are often compared to the rite of the sweat lodge (e.g. Eastman 84), but again Harjo's focus is more on the experience of word and song than sacrament: "The holy ghost danced through these songs," she concludes. At this point, then, dance - the embodiment of song - be- comes the dominant image of transformation. In the prose section which follows this poem in "Song of Solomon," Harjo describes a visit to her uncle Clark's "holiness church" - a gathering of poor sharecroppers and laborers - that serves as a site of cultural and spiritual permeability. To her astonishment, here in the midst of seeming stoicism and sensual repression, music, preaching, and eventually even dance effect a "transformation of the congregation." These people too, it seems, are being turned inside out in a state of ecstasy (or literal ex- stasis).10 By the end of the service, all participants are "filled with the Holy Ghost," who, the young Harjo is informed by her cousin, "sang and talked through them." They are "dancing around the church in a conga line, singing and praising God," she observes. "[A] mazed at this transforma- tion," the fourteen-year-old makes a theological leap and concludes that "the Holy Ghost must be a woman. Why else would she be invisible in a church that told wives to be obedient to their husbands as if they didn't have souls?" (429). Like Erdrich, then, Harjo feminizes God. In the former poet's image of the mother wren and her offspring, we saw this accomplished through the exploration of creation as the institution of mutual need - or the felt presence of an absence. Harjo's text achieves the same feminizing effect by examining invisibility - or the sensible absence of a presence. Harjo is also, again, distinguishing between the spirit of the word and the letter of the law held by institutional "keepers of the book." She applies a tribal, anti-hierarchical perspective on gender to a critique of Christian sexism, in a way which is quite fitting. "|T|nnovat[ing] within a circle of changing tradition,"11 she offers a fresh interpretation of the Spirit, which also reflects a long tradition of seeing the third person of the</page><page sequence="16">74 Religion &amp; Literature Christian Trinity as Sophia, the feminine personification of Wisdom in the Hebrew Scriptures.12 Her scathing conclusion about the Spirit's invisibil- ity - corresponding to an erasure which the Church historically has at- tempted not only in regards to women, but also to all that is Native (as in the motto "kill the Indian to save his soul") - then exposes for institutional hypocrisy what is too often passed off as theological paradox (i.e. sexism).13 True paradox, for Harjo, is more like Erdrich's sacrament and Tinker's reciprocal dualism. It is organic and in-process, like the "power of the corn growing" (427). The tension of paradox, like that of metaphor, analogy, and sacrament, is the unstable border between is and is not, inside and outside, which is always ready to shift, burst, and transform. Like Erdrich's, then, her poems expose instabilities at the heart of Christian doctrines as a resource for transformation. Perhaps because the Spirit in "Song of Solomon" is not silent, if invisible, Harjo is able to hear in her voice the song of her beloved. So she fosters the hope of metamorphosis, and sets out to urge the Holy Spirit toward a newly visible form. The youngjoy therefore returns to successive services with her clarinet, and accompanies her piano-playing uncle. The author relates what transpires in terms fitting a prophetic vision: The fourth night I finally saw the Holy Ghost. By then I'd almost given up. I'd been looking for a shimmering spirit, like the ones who used to visit when I was a child, or for an angel-like presence to come floating out of the sky while the preacher was talk-singing. Instead, she appeared to me in the most unlikely place, in the face of a timid young woman who wasn't more than twenty but looked twice her age. She wasn't the face of the beloved I had imagined. Her four children circled here as she shook in communal passion on the linoleum floor of the church. The Holy Ghost gave this woman her tongue, turned her into an orator who sang beautiful words in a mysterious and compelling language. (430) Like Erdrich's wren (also mother of four) this vision involves an integration of tribal and Christian perspectives. The number indicates ceremonial time and sacred space in Native terms, but that the Spirit appears in a church, is identified as "the Holy Ghost," and brings the pentecostal gift of tongues clearly marks the event as ecclesial. One world is not subsumed by the other, however, for the Spirit herself appears in a new, third form - one which replicates neither the "shimmering" presences of Harjo's Indian spirituality nor the angels of Christian tradition. Instead, she takes on the body of a woman who is both Christian believer and Corn Mother: "In her I saw the power of the fields, what made the corn grow," Harjo</page><page sequence="17">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 75 concludes; "I saw the loved [sic] and the beloved. It was a power similar to what I have seen since, in the ceremonies of my Muscogee people as we prayed and danced together" (431). The Spirit's song, therefore, is paradox itself. Singing in unknown tongues - even in members of the ecclesial body - she utters more than the Church can contain or comprehend. It takes a paradoxical position between worlds, perhaps, to note the transformative integrity of this voice. The offspring of a Creek father and a mixed-blood Cherokee and French mother (who had been told to expect twins) ("Ordinary" 265), a poet and musician who loves the Black-originated forms of jazz and the blues (that most paradoxical mix of joy and lament) (267), and the descendent of Creek Baptist missionaries, Harjo seems well-situated, with an ear well- tuned, to embrace this kind of music. Her ear, like her eye, is integrative. "I walk in and out of many worlds " she states, I used to see being born of this mixed-blood/mixed-vision a curse, and hated myself for it. It was too confusing and destructive when I saw the world through that focus. The only message I got was not belonging anywhere, not to any side. I have since decided that being familiar with more than one world, more than one vision, is a blessing, and I know that I made my own choices. I also know that it is only an illusion that any of the worlds are separate. ("Ordinary 266) If the inability of the "mixed-blood" and multicultural poet to sustain a singular cultural identity and location suggests a "crack" in her integrity - as traditional or Christian, as Native or Western, as tribal or urban - it is a fissure which is endlessly productive. It is like "Rabbit's heart cracking open" in unquenched desire and doubt, to birth humanity. This is the Muscogee trickster myth Harjo dialogizes with the biblical logos-myth in her prose poem "Original Memory" (IMLW 47). Like Rabbit, the poet hovers on the not-yet abyss of between times, and the song which bridges and connects the singer to multiple worlds is, as we saw in "Song of Solomon," desire. Desire, it seems, is inextricable from doubt, and is an agent of creativity. "Love is always love," Harjo writes, "but we're con- vinced there isn't enough there either, so we pull ourselves out of our ceremonial spiral . . . into this other world because whatever world we are entering or leaving we are still looking for love" (47). If Harjo's response to the official word of the Church is not Christian belief, her suggestion that doubt may have been present with the Word in the beginning implies a paradoxical and potentially transformative relationship between belief and doubt at the borders and margins of religion. Like the tension between presence and absence in states of need, of desire, or of percep- tible invisibility, this pair of terms is significantly relational. Faith and</page><page sequence="18">76 Religion &amp; Literature doubt, like sensuality and sensibility, are the felt experience of the border- lands. They are what blur the margins of identity and make connection with the Other possible. Such a transformative relationship appears in the title poem of Harjo's collection The Woman Who Fell From the Sky. Another of her many prose- poems, it recounts and interweaves multiple narratives: the early years of Johnny and Lila as Indian kids, bereft and abused in a Catholic boarding school; the encounter of their present-day urban incarnations - the Viet- nam veteran St. Coincidence and the woman falling toward him from the sky; and the tribal myth about women who ran off with the stars. Both of the poem's central figures have survived trauma by adopting elements from spiritual narratives to reinvent identities for themselves that embody the paradox of their worlds. St. Coincidence is the name the man takes for himself in "the city of terrible paradox." He is "not a saint, perhaps a murderer," we are informed. But because the latter is true only if we "count the people he shot during the stint that took his mind in Vietnam or Cambodia," we are left to wonder whether he isn't, rather, or also, a victim (5). St. Coinci- dence is an ambiguous figure, and his vision of the woman falling from the sky outside a Safeway store is likewise open to interpretation. On one level he is the stereotypical doomed urban Indian, confusedly grasping at bits of Christian and tribal memory to name the alcohol-induced hallucinations that sustain his pathetic hope. But from another perspective, he is the Saint he claims to be - bearing the nation's mortification and, through suffering and denial, achieving other-worldly vision on our behalf. A postmodern prophet, he perceives the "safe way" of entry between heaven and the supermarket. As his name (Coincidence) and location (paradox) suggest, he is in some ways both, and if he does not quite transcend tragedy by spiritual means, he at least survives. It is his refusal to be simply either Indian victim or Catholic martyr that ensures his survival. Too disconnected from tribal life to be one of Erdrich's Sun Dancers, he nonetheless practices a similar kind of participatory demise in his daily life, and ultimately suggests the promise of a mutual regeneration. Em- bracing the coincidence of dual identities, he is able to counter the "wave of falling" with "the converse wave of gathering together" (9). He is not caught up and re-birthed by any spirit-bird, but when he catches the falling woman in his arms, he too is caught and re-gathered. The falling woman has likewise undergone a series of transformations sparked by loss and desire. It is not entirely clear how the girl Lila became the woman in the sky, but even in school her "spirit knew how to climb to</page><page sequence="19">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 77 the stars" and Johnny had "watched her once make the ascent, after a severe beating" (6). If her self-separation is the transcendence necessary to the survival of trauma, it is only a temporary escape. A return and re- incorporation is required. Despite their Catholic education, Lila and Johnny share a strongly tribal spiritual vision, which, in contrast to Western Christianity, is more spatial than temporal (Deloria "Vision" 112; Schultz and Tinker 62). They are not waiting out their suffering, invested in some future revelation, redemption, or triumph over evil. Instead, they look for points of contact and entry between co-existing worlds, as a means to strengthen and balance themselves to carry on in the work of maintaining evil within limits - to achieve personal and cosmic harmony and wholeness. In response to the reality of evil, the young Lila is not interested in debating whether God is "father of saints" or "mother of demons." She has "seen God and could tell you God was / neither male nor female and made of absolutely everything of / beauty, of wordlessness" (7). The nuns, dis- tressed as much by her mysticism as apparent religious syncretism, dismiss her vision as "blasphemy" (8). They cannot grasp the paradox of a God who is both utterly present in creation - even in the shape of "a flock of birds who / know exactly when to turn together in flight" - and also wholly unnamable (7). Lila not only sees God, she knows how to meet God - to enter the shape and condition of this unspeakable beauty - and fly. When we find the woman falling, then, it is not from grace; she is not the Christian "fallen woman" whom the saint will restore. Her fall, like the birth-slam to earth in Erdrich's baptism poem, is the necessary balance to her climb, and constitutes the flight to which she has been leaning since conception. In fact, she descends to earth "in a slow spin, like the spiral of events marking an ascension of grace" (5). In the "reciprocal dualism" Tinker attributes to the architecture of a Plains Indian cosmology, earth and sky, above and below, relate in a circle of balance and reciprocity, which is reflected in exogamous kinship practices (122-3). Lila's ascent to the stars is sparked by a myth that makes this necessary pattern of exogamy quite literal, and her fall therefore does not imply degeneration, but simply a re-crossing or incorporative return. Having run off with one of the stars who had "made their way down stairs of ice to the earth / to find mates," and having given birth to several children by him, Lila appears fully incorporated into the realm of the sky. The story of crossing-over that was "told before she'd grown ears to hear, as she turned / from stone to fish to human in her mother's belly," (8) seems finally to have fixed in another evolutionary form. But, like one of</page><page sequence="20">78 Religion &amp; Literature the women in the myth, Lila eventually feels called back by the song or prayer of Johnny's memory. "She dared to look back and fell," the old story goes, "Fell through centuries, through the beauty of the night sky." Like Lot's wife, the mythical woman and Lila disobey their husband's warnings, look back, and vanish. Unlike the biblical figure, their falls are leaps into another life, and answers to someone else's remembering of them. Finding herself at the threshold she's been warned is "too sacred for women, " Lila clutches her twins, and with her other child clinging to her, looks "into the forbidden place" and "leap[s]." Like the unnamed woman who "took up where she had left off" (8), Lila lands in the arms of St. Coincidence. That her star children are safely in tow suggests that the return is more than a simple reversal, however. The presence of her mixed-realm children signals the importation of innovation. Mythical women who run off for inter-species sexual escapades, after all, often return with items or offspring that prove essential to the survival of the people. The woman's return to earth may be seen as yet another transforma- tion, therefore. "[T]he urge to fly," for Lila, had been "as strong as the need to push at the precipice of any birth," so when St. Coincidence's memory/song/prayer becomes something she cannot ignore, her plunge off the precipice of heaven is both a spiritual flight and a birthing. When she lands back on earth, she has come round in a spiral, not merely circled on the same plane. As the saint literally turns from his panhandling, he becomes something new, as well, catching the woman whom he has called back into her new self. "Everyone turns together," Lila's childhood vision of God suggested, "though we may not see each / other stacked in invisible dimensions" (7). Memory can effect a literal re-membering of relations, it seems, as Johnny and Lila are gathered together in the poem's final lines. But those relations are always also being refigured by the incorporation of difference. The opening poem of The Woman Who Fell From the Sky, "Reconciliation: A Prayer" introduces the image of gathering as a sacred act of mutual integration that depends upon both memory and hope. It begins: We gather at the shore of all knowledge as peoples who were put here by a god who wanted relatives. This god was lonely for touch, and imagined herself as a woman, with children to suckle, to sing with - to continue the web of the terrifyingly beautiful cosmos of her womb. This god became a father who wished for others to walk beside him in the belly of creation, (no pag.)</page><page sequence="21">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 79 Such gathering happens at the point where knowledge turns to imagina- tion, and imagination then effects transformation. "We" push to the limits of our known world, and recognize god as a relative. This doesn't neces- sarily involve anthropomorphism, of course, since from a Native perspec- tive all that is animate is related, and all creation is animate. This recognition and identification happens at the border and intersection of worlds. As in Lila's vision, God is neither male nor female here, and is not imagined as such per se. "Man" is not made in "God's image" and God is not projected in man's. Rather, it is this god's own desire and imagina- tion - flexible and fluid enough to enable transformations as mother, father, sister, brother, and lover - that prompt a creative process of indi- viduation and identification. There is not so much a "Fall" in this creation story, either, as a leap into, and into the space of, an other. God still walks in the belly of creation. If there is nevertheless a profound sense of dis- integration and loss in this "prayer," it is to be countered not by a rejection of this world - a desire to return to some other-worldly or pre-modern "garden" - but rather by a stubborn and mutual holding together of it. "Oh sun, moon, stars," the speaker calls, "our other relatives peering at us from the in- /side of god's house walk with us as we climb into the next century / naked but for the stories we have of each other. Keep us from giving / up in this land of nightmares which is also the land of miracles." To repudiate the nightmare and give up on and in history means disen- gagement from the other side of the paradox, which is miracle. Story and song ("which we've been promised has no beginning or / end") are not elegiac substitutes for connection, but the very performance which "gather [s] up" the "strands broken from the web of life" (no pag.), re- weaving survivors together with their lost relatives, with each other, in the ever-changing fabric of the cosmos. In both of these poems, prayer is the vocal hinge between worlds. The re-calling of one's relations (lost loves, ancestors, creator, etc.) in story or song bridges the spiral of time to bring those "stacked" in different spatial dimensions into coincidence. Like the jazz duet of "Original Memory" or the clarinet invocation of the Spirit in "Song of Solomon," prayer func- tions as a paradoxical act for Harjo, holding together the disparate realities of pain and love, earth and sky, absence and presence. A Native vision of "all my relations," which emphasizes the "where" of spiritual fulfillment and wholeness (i.e. in our midst) rather than a "when" (i.e. later), also unsettles the Western dualisms of earth/heaven, now/ then, fall/grace and could bring a radically integrative understanding to Chris-</page><page sequence="22">80 Religion &amp; Literature tian prayer - as a walking and singing with the original, transforming, and transformative Word. By refusing to separate the power of the Christian Word from the presence of a pan-religious Spirit - and from paradox - Harjo indicates new possibilities of reciprocity both within Protestantism and between religious traditions. Likewise, Erdrich, in her exploration of the tension between ascetic and sacramental traditions, suggests that the Native values of balance and mutuality can enliven Catholicism. In both poets5 revisions of Christian tradition, the inseparability of material and spiritual realities, and the creative power of the female body - which is both needy and nourishing - are essential elements. Each poet also offers a vision and model of inter-religious integration which speaks a word of hope as well as criticism, a "yes" and also a "no," to the Church. The transformations of Christian sacrament, Word, and Spirit enacted in their works pose a radical challenge to paternalistic, linear, hierarchical, and triumphalistic models of faith. Their insistence on holding together faith and doubt, birth and death, creation and desire, heaven and earth, through analogy, paradox, and other transformative rituals of language, bears witness that, if the religious language of the Church seems irrelevant for both Native and Euro-Americans, the potential for transformation remains. Continu- ing the work of co-creation, these poet-makers sustain the possibility of Christian meaning in postmodern America by exposing the permeable boundaries of the faith. From the intersection of worlds and the margins of the Church, their voices urge those within to let go of the oppositional structures which bind us to ideals of purity and dominion, and to let ourselves fall into the radical and paradoxical desire for transformation by the immanent other - the ones whose erasure is marked by our presence on this continent. Such a fall is also a leap of faith - a willful belief that such transformation is essential to our mutual continuance and co-inci- dence in this shared world. University of Dayton I am grateful to the Catholic Intellectual Tradition Forum at the University of Dayton, whose support, in the form of a summer research grant and in critical feedback from the members, helped bring these ideas to fruition.</page><page sequence="23">SHEILA HASSELL HUGHES 8 1 NOTES 1. Recent collections by editors James Treat and Jace Weaver attest to the variety of experiences and range of approaches of Native American clergy, laity, and theologians themselves - and of their Native "post-Christian" dialogue partners. 2. Gloria Anzaldua's theorizing of geographic, cultural, linguistic, psychic, and spiri- tual "borderlands" and of a hybrid, "mestiza" identity inform my approach. 3. "Traditional" religion designates tribal beliefs and practices that have pre-contact roots. 4. The term "creation" is especially useful to this study because of its ambiguity. It is used in Native as well as Christian traditions and implies both the created order and the act of creating. It signals the spiritual significance of the natural realm, but may well indicate quite different views of spiritual presence and of relations among creator, creatures, and other elements. 5. Serving as an axis of cosmic forces in both traditions, the tree of life offers a particularly useful image with which to explore inter-religious integration. Peelman's comparison of two paintings which explore the tree of life symbol - "Christ on the Tree of Life," painted by Pacino De Bonaguido in early fourteenth-century Italy, and the 1983 work of Anishnabe artist Blake Debassige - is fascinating and relevant. Of Anishnabe heritage on her mother's side, Erdrich's poem presents a 1 3th-century Italian saint whose vision of the tree of life is closer to Debassige 's than to the medieval European painter's. In Debassige 's work, the Christie body and the natural realm are integrated, such that the body itself (both male and female, light and dark) is not "on" the tree, is itself the trunk and limbs of the tree ( Peelman 194 / 21 1). 6. As Erdrich's book jacket explains, the literal meaning of "baptism of desire" is more narrow: "Baptism by blood, water, or desire is necessary for salvation in Roman Catholic tradition, and baptism of desire is the term used for the leap of trust by which a sincere believer can experience spiritual regeneration." 7. Susan Stanford Friedman's treatment of syncretism in Erdrich's 1988 novel Tracks highlights ascetic practices in both Catholic and Ojibwe traditions and offers a helpful analysis of the interplay between political and religious forces in the author's work. 8. Erdrich appears less inclined than Deloria to conclude that "Christianity is the chief evil ever to have been loosed on the planet" whereas "tribal religions have a great deal of insight and can be very helpful to people today" ( "Christianity" 31). Indeed, Deloria's characterization (or caricature) of Christianity reenacts the very polarization he blames on the imperialistic impulse of that religion. Erdrich's work is especially interest- ing precisely because - like some other "mixed blood" writers - she neither shies away from radical critique of imperialist tendencies nor ever resorts to an either/or proposition. 9. A number of Native interpreters have stressed the literal implications of "world" in the popular scriptural text "For God so loved the world. . ." (John 3: 16), in order explicitly to extend God's love and sacrifice to the non-human. See Maxey, McKay, and Schultz and Tinker, for examples. 10. 1 use the term "ex-stasis" to emphasis the way in which ecstatic experience involves a kind of stepping or standing outside of oneself. As such, it is tied to embodiment and social location (where one stands) and can enable a radical imaginative identification with others/otherness.</page><page sequence="24">82 Religion &amp; Literature 1 1 . This is how Gail Tremblay describes the approach of Native American artisans to their craft traditions (83). 12. This tradition has most recently been revived by feminist theologians such as Elizabeth Johnson and Elisabeth Shiissler Fiorenza. 13. "The world is rife with paradox," Harjo states, "yet paradox was not allowed in the church, or rather specifically allowed when it came to concepts such as the Trinity" ("Song" 424).
