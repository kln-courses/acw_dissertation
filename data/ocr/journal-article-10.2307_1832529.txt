In what other poems, except in Shakespeare's dramas, shall we find such a galaxy of characters, so varied and so sustained, as we find in the Iliaci and Odyssy ? In the Aencid there can hardly be said to be more than one character, while that onle is wanting in in- terest. In Dante the characters are historical. In Paraezse Lost there is but one, which represents the majesty of evil. The deity is abstract deity; the angels are angels; the pictures of Adam and Eve, however beautiful in their way, are pictures of perfect innocence. Where else shall we find such a wealth of vignettes in the form of similes ? Where such a picture of conjugal love as the parting of Hector and Andromache ? Where such a fairy-tale as the Odyssey with the Isle of Calypso, Circe, the Sirens, the Lotus-eaters, the hall of Aeolus, the Phaeacians ? How completely have these crea- tions of a poet of the dawn taken hold on the imagination of the world ! The least artistic passages in appearance are the recur- rences of commonplace descriptions of commonplace matters, such as navigation, sacrifice and feastinig; yet even these have more the air of refrain than of careless repetition. Moral blemishes, such as the repulsive character of Athene, or the atrocities ascribed to Achilles, are faults of primitive ethics or national prejudices, not failures of art. Wonderfully close Homer comes to us across the ages. Modern pathos can go no deeper than Andromache lament- ing that her Hector, slain by Achilles, will not from his death-bed stretch out his arms to her and say that pregnant word (7xUw.1.VV e7o0), on which she might brood amidst her tears for the rest of her days. Sentimental appreciation of the picturesque we do not expect in a primitive and unspiritual age, any more than we expect romantic love; but the Homeric descriptions of the sea, the storm, the calm, VOL. VII-I I</page><page sequence="2">2 Goidwin Smzilh the star-lit heavens, imply on the part of the writer something at least of the emotion which they awaken in us. The descriptionls of the dreamer's sensations' and of the play of the wanderer's memory are wonderfully modern in their refinement and subtlety. Nor, if our ears tell us true, in spite of probable differences of pro- nunciation, is the metrical art in these poems inferior to their poetic excellence. Instances without number might be cited of what sounds to us the happy adaptation of the music of a passage to its sense. The lines describing Jupiter's nod of assent 2 is one of them. To find a time and place before recorded civilization at which poetic art can have reached a lheight only once afterwards attained, is the Homieric problem, very interesting, and at the same time very tantalizing, since means of a chronological solution we have none. We can only hope to determine the political, social and aesthetic date. The single authorship of the Odyssey is not much contested, and that of the Iliad seems to me hardly contestable. The patch- work theory, started by Wolf and carried to an extreme length by Lachtmann, was the offspring of a Germany whose learning at that time was greater than her taste and judgment. The theory of Grote, who regards the Iliad as a nucleus with superadditions, is not the result of original investigation but is the Wolf-Lachmann theory in full retreat. Editorial patching in places there may have been. This was likely enough in the course of transmission and revision. It must surely be seen that the unity of the Iliad is not mechanical but organic; that the parts would bleed if torn asunder. Did one poet sing the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, another its consequences, and a third their reconciliation ? Did one poet write the part in which the Greeks were defeated, and another balance it by their success.? Did one poet produce the Andromache of the sixth Iliad, and another re-produce her in the last ? If the unity of the Ody'sscy is admitted, if it is impossible to suppose that one poet described Ulysses in Calypso's Isle yearning for his home, and that other poets carried him through a series of adventures to the fulfilment of his desire, why should we think a multiplicity of poets necessary to the production of the Iliad? I almost as thoroughly believe in the common authorship of the two poems. The theme of the Odyssey is more romantic and less heroic than that of the Ilzizd, and the style is suitable to the subject. In the last books there is undoubtedly a falling off, which might be the natural consequence of exhaustion or old age. But even here such passages as the meeting of Ulysses with his dog Argos, and 1 Ilihad, XXII. 199-201. 2 Zliad, I. 528-530-</page><page sequence="3">The Age of Homer 3 the comparisoni of the flitting of the souls of the suitors to the flit- tino, of bats disturbed in their cranny l bespeak the peerless hand. There are, no doubt, iiisi p-ius objections to the common author- ship. But poetry is not judiciable in the court of nisiprizus. It is passing strange, no doubt, that after a ten years' siege Priam should be asking Helen to point out to him the chiefs of the besieging army. But it is not Priam, it is the reader or hearer of the bard who wants the information. It is passing strange that in Sophocles Oedipus should have sat so long onl his throne without seekiing to kniow what had become of his predecessor. It is passing strange that in Paradise Lost Omnipotence, having shut up Satan in hell, should fail to keep him there, and that Omniscience should be ignorant of his flight. There are discrepancies in the Homeric poems about the age of Neoptolemus, and the chronology of Telemachus's voyage of inquiry after his father, whiclh might be damaging under forensic cross-examination. The strongest point against the identity of the author of the Odysscy and the author of the Iba&gt;d is the discrepancy about the wife of Hephaestus, who in the Iliad is Charis, while in the Odysscy she is Aphrodite and the heroinie of a queer story. But Homer makes pretty free with his pantheon. What are these things set in the balance against agreement in the delineation of a strongly-marked and complex character such as that of Ulysses; or against general identity of thought, sentiment, manner, and versification ? Great, surely, would be the chances against the production by different writers of twvo poems equal in scale and so uniform in genius and harmonizing in details as to have been generally taken for works of the same hand. Inferior epic writers of the Cycle evidently spread themselves over a wide canlvas, taking as their theme the whole history of the Trojan war from Leda's egg. But alike in the case of the Ilizad and that of the Odyssey, the writer prefers a narrow canvas; in the Iliad, a single incident of the siege of Troy; in the Odyssey, a limited portionl of the adventures of Ulysses; his strength lying in careful painting of character, in dialogue, and in fulness of descriptive detail. The case for common authorship might almost rest on this identity of selec- tion anid treatment. However, whether the two poems are by the same author or not, there can be no doubt that they are contem- porary and products of the same school. This is sufficiently proved by the idenitity of language, and the occurrence of the same stand- ard phrases in them both. Herodotus, whose authority as to the date of these poems is commonly accepted, puts Homer and Hesiod four hundred years I Odyssey, XXIV. 6-9.</page><page sequence="4">4 Goldwit Smith. and not more before his own time. Herodotus is a charmincg writer; he gives us an inestimable picture of Greek life; but of critical accuracy as to facts he has been abundantly slhown to be destitute. To give one more instance, he makes the fleet of Xerxes lose up- wards of seven hundred sail by battle or storm between its arrival at Sepias Akte and its arrival at Phalerum. Yet he tells us that tlle loss was made up by contingents from Carystus in Euboea, Andros, Tenos, and the other Cyclades; so that the number of the fleet at Phalerum was about what it had been on its arrival at Sepias Aite. Seven hundred sail from a little town and a few petty islands ! The numbers of the army of Xerxes pass belief; the details of his march are evidently poetic, and the narrative of the battle of Mara- thon bewilders the commentators and will bewilder them to the end of time. Yet the inivasion of Greece by Xerxes fell within tlle his- torian's life-time, and he must liave had abundant access to con- temporary information. Four centuries seemns a wvide gap to be spanned. Comparinig the language of Herodotus with that of Homer, and making due allowance for poetic form and license, it appears unlikely that there should have been so wide an interval between the two. There are perhaps in Homer from twelve to tweenty words which are so archaic, that it puzzles the acumen of Buttmannl to determine their meaning. There are peculiarities of inflection and syntax of which it would be difficult to say what proportions are archaic, poetic, or idiosynl- cratic. As to the use of the digamma, Monro seems doubtful. But the language is in all respects vitally the same as that of Ionian writers, and we can use the Homeric poems in our schools and col- leges as a text-book of poetic Greek. That there should have been any great tribal cataclysm after the composition of the poems seems therefore hardly possible. From the time of Homer to that of Pisistratus the continuity of race and language must apparently have remained unbroken. This it can hardly have done for four hundred years. Had a tribal cataclysm taken place, the invading tribe would hardly have adopted the heroes, legends, and ballads of the conqueror. That the art of poetry, or any art, should have reached perfection, an unapproachable perfection, at a bound is incredible. There must have been a considerable period of preparation; and if we throw the date of Homer back to the dawn of Greek nationality, where is this period to be found ? Some assume that Homer does not mention writing, and hence infer that he lived before its invention. Had he any occasion to mention it? He surely, however, does mention it plainly enough.</page><page sequence="5">The Age of Homier 5 He says' that Bellerophon was charged by Proetus with folded tablets wherein Proetus had written things full of deadly import. That such poems as the Iliad and the Odyssey might have been transmitted by memory is undeniable. Memory, it is truly said, would be stronger before the general use of writing; and even in our day we have had a man who could say by heart a great number of the plays of Shakespeare. The difficulty would be, not in the transmission without writing, but in the composition. Howv could the adjustment of parts, the elaboration of the plot, the touching and retouching which a work of high art implies, be performed without means of keeping the work before the composer's mind ? Milton was blind when he composed Par-adise Lost, but it would be written down from his dictation and read over to him for improvement and revision. The political era of the Iliad is plainly fixed. It is the era of democracy lifting its head against nobility and hereditary rule. Thersites is the democratic agitator, hated by the bard who sings in royal or aristocratic halls, and who paints him a monster of ugliness most hateful to a race which adored beauty, as well as a paragon of moral vileness; exults in the chastisement inflicted on him, and makes the people sympathize with the chieftain who inflicts it, as he undoubtedly wishes the crowd in the agora would do. The passage is in spirit cognate to one in Theognis. It is not likely that the course of political evetnts should have twice travelled the same round. The chiefs preside in the public assembly and lead, perhaps dictate, its councils; but there is a public assembly and the need of popular assent is felt. Public opinion is repeatedly personified by 7ze, as in the /7iDidJII. 271I: "o3Th (txo&amp; zcc ts us con, toO' o wiOi." Telem- achus in the assembly of Ithaca summoned by him makes a direct appeal to the people. All this bespeaks a transition from monarchy and aristocracy to democracy, such as the Greek colonies in Asia Minor evidently underwent, and probably from their maritime and adventurous clharacter, their novelty, and the volatile spiIit which in Herodotus they exhibit, more rapidly than it was undergone by the comnmunities of old Greece. Oratory is greatly valued and has reached high perfection, which, without a popular audience, it could hardly have done. The de- scription of Ulysses as an orator2 indicates careful study of the art. Law is, like the Brehon law, traditional not statutory; justice is rudimentary, being administered by clhiefs or elders who are jury- men as well as judges. But the Greeks never showed much apti- IIliad, VI.

The Areo- pagus and the Heliaea were jury-courts without a judge, the Heliaea on a democratic footing and scale. That Homer had predecessors, that his art did not spring into existence out of a void, we might be sure without his telling us. However, he tells us so himself when he prays to the Muse, to im- part to him also his share of her lore: "z ribv 4.6e ;re, Ous, O6raTrsp Je0S, i7r' xa' @pev."' Both in the 1liad and in the Odyssey, but espe- cially in the Kliad, he clearly assumes that the characters whom he is bringing on the scene are already known to his auchence. Patro- clus is introduced by him as "'Menoetiades." He does not, before proceeding to sing the wrath of Achilles, tell you who Achilles was, who Agamemnon was, or what brought them together on the scene. The siege of Troy was evidently a theme as familiar to his audience as the siege of Jerusalem would be to the audience of Tasso. Art in the Homeric poems is evidently ideal. The shield of Achilles utterly transcends anything of which relics have been left or that possibly could have been created in that, or indeed in any, day. But ideals are not found without some reality to suggest and support them. Aesthetic aspirations at all events were high. If with these advances toward intellectual civilization we are surprised at finding homicide prevalent and punished only as a private wrong by private vengeance, piracy and marauding licensed, a general re- liance for security on the stronig hand rather than on public law, no quarter given in battle, and such atrocities as the dragging of Hec- tor behind the chariot of Achilles round the walls of Troy, the sacrifice of twelve Trojani captives at the funeral of Patroclus, or the hideous acts of vengeance committed by Ulysses in the Odyssey, we may bear in mind that in Italy contemporary with the divine artists, the famous writers, and the pioneers of science were the life of crime and violence depicted in the Memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini, the hunger tower, the torture-houses of the Visconti, the Borgias, and the Bravi. At Athens, in her most intellectual era, there is much savagery. The people vote the massacre of the whole of Mitylene; they actually massacre all the Mitylenians who had come into their own hands. They massacre the Melians for simply stand- ing a siege. The factions at Corcyra behaved like Red Indians. Human sacrifice had ceased, but the existence of the word fap,oax6, a scape-goat, shows that it had not been unknown at Athens. The license of piracy when exercised against foreign ships was prolonged well into historic times.2 Alexander, the much adored, not only 1 Odyssey, I.

The relation of the Greeks in the Iliad to the Trojans and their Asiatic allies is remarkable. The Asiatics are enemies, and they are inferior to the Greeks in military discipline; but they are not barbarous or objects of contempt; far fi-om it. Priam, Hector, Aeneas are perfectly on a par with their Greek counterparts. The parting of a Trojan chief from his wife is the subject of the most beautiful picture in the f/iad. Troy is the peculiar object of regard to the Hellenic Zeus. Athene is worshipped in Troy. Language is no barrier between the Greek and the Trojan chiefs. Paris, the guilty author of the war, is a gay Lothario, ratlher contemptible but not hateful, oIn the contrary amusing and attractive in his way. The Greek Diomed and the Asiatic Glaucus are bound by an an- cestral tie of friendship to each other. This would seem to accord pretty well with the relation of the Greeks to the Lydian dynasties as depicted by Herodotus. Two chiefs of the Trojan alliance, Aeneas, chief of the Dardanians and Sarpedon, chief of the Lycians, are sons of Hellenic deities; Aeneas of Aphrodite, Sarpedon of Zeus. In the Dardanian- dynasty Homer evidently felt a local inter-est. From Strabo's account of the Lycian Confederation it would seem that the Lycians were Hellenized. This could hardly have taken place in a very prehistoric age. It has been said that iron is scarce in Homer and that he there- fore belongs to the copper age. Copper is the prevalent metal and the material of armor; but iron does not appear to be very scarce.' The proverbial phrase " iron heart "2 seems also to show familiarity witlh iron. The axles of the chariots are of iron; the clash of battle is described as " 6{/Oi-1-)&lt;."3 Little, therefore, can be based in this case on the metallic distinction of eras. Homer tells you distinctly that his story belongs not to his own age but to an heroic age that is passed. The men of his owIn time are degenerate; they cannot wield such weapons as the heroes wielded or hurl such stones as the heroes hurled.4 To what extent the reproduction of the past goes we can hardly divine. But the war of single combats is pretty clearly a part of it. In Virgil, through the descriptions of the canmp of Aeneas, Roman castrame- tation is seen.

Perhaps the Gargantuan feasts with their enormous masses of meat, strongly contrasted with "light Attic fare," belong also to the heroic past. The prediction that the descendants of Aenieas should reign in Dardania1 is evidently history in the guise of proph- ecy and throwvs back the heroic founder of the line to an age far aniterior to that of the poet. Homer's ships are more intensely real than his horses. About the horses there is a good deal that is mythical. Some of thenm are of divine lineage. They talk and weep. Andromache gives Hector's horses wine as if it were a familiar practice. The ships otl the other hand are intensely real. Homer evideintly revels in everything nautical; in the details of ship-building, in the handling of the galley, in the even sweep of her oars, in her boundinig over thle dark blue wave which roars round her as she speeds upon her way. $l* 0^ (X2&gt;$fAO0 b.,($2iv ,pS?f2S t.Gf (X/J1C (is X'J/J tY (, "OS1v Xtz-,(i ( 911Z .

The descriptions of the sea and nautical similes are always full of intense life. This designates the writer as a native of one of the maritime colonies in Asia Minor. It would seem that religious faith in Homer's time was in an advanced stage of decay, and wvas giving way to a lighlt scepticism which permitted fun to be made of the deities. We are prepared for a good deal in the way of sincere anthropomorphism, as wvell as of moral obliquities in gods made by man after his own image. But can we suppose that an intellect of such depth as that of Homer is not making fun of the deities when he represents Zeus as gaily re- counting to Here his wandering loves, and as challenginig the whole pantheon to a " tug of war "; when he makes gods cuff each other or be wounded by men; when he tells us the story of Ares and Aph- rodite committing cri;;z. co0n. and being captured by the injured Hephaestus amid the general laughter of Olympus ? Formal rev- erence is still paid to the gods, and they are acknowledged as up- 1Zi/(l, XX. 308.

The belief in omens still prevails, and is used for a poetic purpose; but Hector is made to say that he cares little for them and that the best of all omens is to be fighting for one's country. The freedom of personification wvhich produces such beinigs as Ate, Eris, and Litai (prayers) also looks like a sign of a mind little trammelled by belief in the pan- theon. Here again we surely find ourselves in contact with an age of thought far from primeval, as well as with the light and sceptical spirit of the Asiatic Greek. The Catalogue of the Ships, as it is called, remains a puzzle on any hypothesis, and a puzzle on any hypothesis it is likely to remain. Of all passages in the Iliad it is the one most easily detached, and the one the authenticity of which is most questioned, though its char- acter seems to me to be Homeric. The poet appeals to the muses for his knowledge of the facts, and the muses only could have im- parted to him the mythical muster-roll of the mythical fleet of Agamemiion. Its ethnlography extends to the Asiatics as well as to the Greeks. It describes the Peloponnesus as it was before the Dorian invasion, a group of old Greek principalities under a sort of suzerainty of the Lords of Mycenae, without Dorian asceindancy or he Doriain Sparta. \Vhether its ethnography is coirect or is as loose as Horner's topography of the Troad, we lhave no means of ascertainincg. He was not a cartographer, but a highly imaginative poet. A refugee from the Dorian invasion might naturally speak of the land of his origin as it was before the conquest. But on this point wve are in the dark and in the dark we are likely to remain. All dates before the first Olympiad (776 B. C.) are uncertaiin, among the rest that of the Dorian invasion of Peloponnesus, dis- lodged by which, and perhaps by other tribal disturbances, Greeks, carrying with them. the civilization which has left its monuments at Mycenae, emigrated to the coast of Asia Minor and there founded little maritime commonwealths. There can be no doubt that the author of the Iliad was a deni- zen of the north coast of Asia Minor.

The siege of Troy would be a natural subject for a poet belong- ing to one of the maritime cities of Asia Minor whose land had been won in war from the Asiatics. Equally congenial to him would be a story of maritime adventure such as that which is told in the Odyssey. But whether Homer was an Aeolian or an Ionian, it would seem that the perfection of his art, the advance of national culture which the existence of such art implies, the refinement of his senti- ment, the picture of civilization which he presents, and his treatment of the popular religion, point to a later date and one nearer to the Ionian lyricists and philosophers than Herodotus believed or is gen- erally supposed. Settle the question as we will, however, the Ho- meric poems are miracles, and so is Greek art. Phidias is hardly less miraculous than Homer. GOLDWIN SMITH.</page></plain_text>
