Aaron Wellesley College Paul Veyne wrote a book entitled, Did the Greeks Believe their Myths?1 Regarding rabbinic Judaism, one might similarly ask: Did the rabbis believe their imagery? Rabbinic literature is so replete with fanciful images of God and humans and anecdotes of epiphanies involving both, that one naturally wonders whether the midrashic authors believed that their imag- ery reflected some actual moment in the world's history.2 Some scholars have chosen to view the literature as containing parables and images that were composed as mere metaphors, sometimes used for political purposes, and other times to spawn further associations and religious teachings. The question is, can one differentiate true statements about happenings in the 'Paul Veyne, Did the Greeks Believe their Myths: An Essay on the Constitutive Imagina- tion (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988). 20n the concept of history in rabbinic literature, see Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1982).

The tension is especially acute when one consid- ers cosmogony, the story of human origins, and other moments in primoridal history. Yet it is no less present in those simple midrashic "biblical scenes" that are not actually part of the Tanakh, but which the sages readily ascribe to the text. Does a given rabbinic image convey literal beliefs about ma- terial happenings or metaphorical metaphysics?3 Saadia Gaon (882-942 CE) is among the first to clearly articulate both sides of the issue. But it was the dominance of Maimonides' (1135-1204 CE) thinking that would weight the scales against literalism when it came to later theological and exegetical discourse. My goal here is not to review the history of this debate, but instead to focus very narrowly on the ques- tion of Adam's body in the midrashic literature and on what the phrase "created in God's image" says about God's body. I shall start by consider- ing Alon Goshen Gottstein's treatment of this issue in an article that ap- peared in the Harvard Theological Review.4 Gottstein's narrowly defined theme-light-imagery regarding Adam and God in rabbinic literature-will provide a path into some broader methodological issues. They are: (1) How does the question of whether something was meant literally or figuratively influence the way one translates or interprets a text? (2) What can one derive from a specific midrashic pericope with regard to rabbinic "belief' more generally? In what follows, I shall review Gottstein's position and approach. A close reading of a number of key texts will follow. * The Question and the Method In his article, "The Body as Image of God in Rabbinic Literature," Gottstein addresses the issue of anthropomorphism and the question of the divine image.5 Upon asking: "Does God have a body?" Gottstein notes that nowhere in all of rabbinic literature is there a statement that rejects the 3By this question I do not mean to imply that for the literature as a whole, it is an either/ or proposition. Surely the literature could contain both literal statements and metaphorical statements; the question is simply, how does one know which is which? I have, moreover, presented the question in only its most basic terms. 4Alon Goshen Gottstein, "The Body as Image of God in Rabbinic Literature," HTR 87 (1994) 171-95. 5Ibid.

AARON 301 notion of divine corporealism. This being the case, he shifts the inquiry from: "Does God have a body?" to "What kind of body does God have?" Surveying the sources, Gottstein identifies two trends; some sources relate primarily to (1) the "loss of the divine image" in humans, while (2) others employ the image of God in a didactic and moralistic manner. Very early in his presentation, Gottstein cites a passage from Pseudo-Clement that ultimately forms the backbone of his entire approach to the rabbinic mate- rial. After reviewing Gottstein's methodological assumptions and his treat- ment of a number of key rabbinic passages, the Pseudo-Clement text will be considered in detail. As one might have expected, the evidence from rabbinic literature re- garding Adam's body does not prove consistent. Gottstein seeks to recon- cile the differences among the sources: [W]e are searching for a way in which seemingly contradictory state- ments can be reconciled when no conscious attempt at reconciliation is made by the sources themselves. We ask, therefore, not about the mean- ing of a passage, but about the implied logic of the literature as a whole, assuming that the conflicting notions were known at least to the editors of this literature, if not to some of those who actually submit- ted the traditions.6 Just what "an implied logic of the literature as a whole" means and how "logic" might relate to a theological construct receives no further eluci- dation. Strangely enough, Gottstein is willing to sidestep "the meaning of a passage," in pursuit of this "implied logic."7 If one assumes that "the conflicting notions were known," then why should contemporary scholars seek any form of reconciliation between "seemingly contradictory" state- ments? The use of the phrase "seemingly contradictory" loads the question. 12:2 (1996) 137-62; David H. Aaron, "Imagery of the Divine and the Human: On the Mythology of Genesis Rabba 8 ? 1," The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 5 (1995) 1-62. 6Gottstein, "Body as Image of God," 188 (my emphasis). 7The "logic of the literature as a whole" goes well beyond a description of rabbinic theol- ogy-itself, a daunting endeavor. Very few authors have explored the theme systematically. Max Kadushin's Organic Thinking (New York: Bloch, 1976) and The Rabbinic Mind (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1952) are among the most noteworthy early forays into this kind of approach to the literature. A more extensive consideration of the logic of the literature as a whole, using Chomskian linguistics as a metaphor for understanding the way statements attain meaning in rabbinic literature, is now being prepared by Jacob Neusner in The Theological Grammar of the Oral Torah (Binghamton: SUNY Press, forthcoming), pas- sages of which the author has shared with me. While some of Neusner's most recent work has begun to explore broad patterns that might serve as the foundations for a more comprehensive "logic" in rabbinic literature, Gottstein does not cite Neusner's work. Also of relevance by Neusner are his Judaism's Theological Voice (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,</page><page sequence="4">302 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW By claiming that statements are only "seemingly" contradictory, Gottstein paves the way for showing that they are not really contradictory but some- thing else. This bypasses the crucial issue of just whether there is an "im- plied logic" that is cognizant of conflicting pericopes. There is no doubt that the literature contains interpretations that contra- dict one another. I would maintain that any attempt to reconcile the con- tradictions misses the core of the hermeneutic program of the midrashic endeavor. It also employs the concept of "logic" too narrowly. Gottstein has in mind interpropositional logic; that is, the logic of statements that are related to one another by some broader syntactic or literary structure. Propo- sitions deriving from altogether discrete sources, however, need not answer the demands of interpropositional logic. These discrete sources may still employ the "logic" of the culture in making their statements, despite the fact that their conclusions are inconsistent. I will say more on this later. Gottstein acknowledges that tensions in the literature cannot be caused by a chronological dividing line between tannaitic (first through third cen- turies CE) and amoraic (third through fifth centuries) sources. Both eras continue to use the image-lost motif and the didactic parables contiguously. Rather than sustain the conflicting passages as discordant, Gottstein offers a "leap into the realm of the educated hypothesis." He seeks a thesis that will "enable us to speak simultaneously of the loss and the retention of .elem" in humankind, despite the fact that the texts seem to be saying opposite things. I do not suggest that this understanding is implied in any individual text, because each text emphasizes a particular aspect of .elem, ac- cording to its particular agenda. It is possible, however, to propose a model that would account for rabbinic literature's ability to sustain seemingly conflicting understandings of zelem.8 Any elucidation of the principle that underlies rabbinic literature's abil- ity to sustain conflicting notions would be an extremely important contri- bution to the contemporary understanding of rabbinic theology in general. This endeavor requires, however, a massive consideration of how rabbinic literature works; and such a task must start with the question of whether "rabbinic literature" presents us with an ideologically harmonized corpus in any sense whatsoever. Equating the "logic of a literature," or perhaps more 1995) and Symbol and Theology in Early Judaism (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1991), both of which deal with broad structures that permeate rabbinic thought, making it clear that subject matter and logical structure are not one and the same. For a completely different approach, see Boyarin, Intertextuality and Carnal Israel. On the problem of indeterminacy in midrash, see also David Stern, "Midrash and Indeterminacy," Critical Inquiry 15 (1988) 132-62. 8Gottstein, "Body as Image of God," 188.</page><page sequence="5">DAVID H. AARON 303 accurately, the logic of a cultural system, with the logic of how discrete propositions relate from disparate documents within that system or corpus, is only the first error of Gottstein's program. These are altogether distinct kinds of problems. Conflicts between discrete propositions do not inform us regarding the conceptual structure of a culture, which is what I would take "the logic of rabbinic Judaism" to mean. Each statement is autono- mous; until they are juxtaposed, no one would identify them as "contradic- tory." For the time being, I will leave these problems to consider the textual evidence more generally. It should be clear, however, that any attempt to reconcile discrete propositions is doomed to result in a highly artificial description of rabbinic thought. Whatever the "implied logic" of rabbinic literature might be, it is obviously not violated by conflicting propositions.9 I Considering the Sources Gottstein's conclusions derive from just three sources. The first part of the argument claims that Adam emulated the divine image in that he, like God, emitted light. In this way, the likeness that Adam and God shared is not physicality-in the normal sense of having a body-but luminescence. As we have seen, Adam's .elem is his luminous body. In other sources, such as the story of Hillel washing his body [Lev. R. 34.3], the ?elem referred to the physical body. Zelem can thus refer to various levels, or aspects, all of which bear a resemblance to the physical body. I would propose that these various levels, or various bodies, reflect one an- other. The physical body is a reflection of the body of light. This reflection may translate itself down to the details of circumcision. The kind of graded devolutionary process that we encountered above may be a model for two ways of talking about ?elem. The ?elem in its original form may be lost, but the dimmer reflection of this form is extant in the physical body, which may still be spoken of as .elem.10 His conclusion that Adam's body is "light" is based on his reading of Lev. R. 20.2, which reads: rnn 5' tRDn rn n, ltint 1rt 'p. . Gottstein employs the Soncino Midrash Rabbah English translation, which is based on the standard Vilna Hebrew editions: "The apple of Adam's heel out- shone the globe of the sun; how much more so the brightness of his face.""l 9I deal with this issue at length in my forthcoming book, Biblical Ambiguities, but from a different angle.

The difference in translation is impor- tant; it comes down to the question of literal versus figurative representa- tion. Did the midrashist wish to say that the original Adam's heel actually shone more brightly than the sun in the literal sense of having given off light? Perhaps even more importantly, (however one answers this question), is it possible to argue that within rabbinic Judaism, there was the belief that the first Adam was created as light? Here is the complete Slotki translation (used by Gottstein), then the Hebrew from the Margulies critical edition,12 and then my own translation, which will leave certain phrases quite literal and somewhat less than idi- omatic, despite the fact that such a rendering may not be the most felici- tous with respect to the intended meaning. Except for the difference in the attribution, the differences in the Hebrew texts that underlie the Slotki and Margulies editions are mostly orthographic.13 Slotki Translation: Resh Lakish in the name of R. Simon ben Menasseya said: "the apple of Adam's heel outshone the globe of the sun; how much more so the brightness of his face. Nor need you wonder. In the ordinary way, if a person makes servants, one for himself and one for his household, whose will he make more beautiful? Not his own?

'4All midrashic passages are my own translations, unless otherwise noted.</page><page sequence="7">DAVID H. AARON 305 There are two problematic terms in the passage.15 The first is mnio,p, which in the majority of manuscripts appears as nno5p. One variant con- tains the phrase 1n r no5p '1'b nirni bp ("all the more so, the beauty of the countenance of his [Adam's] face"). Jastrow relates the term to the Greek KpiouaaXXoc which he renders "crystal," but takes to mean "brightness."16 When appearing in conjunction with the word "face" (M'nn), Jastrow sug- gests that the phrase is comparable to nm inr, "the radiance of his face," with the meaning of "beauty of features, countenance." The Greek meaning of IKpu'OxTa oc as "ice" or "crystal," describes something that can reflect light or be transparent, rather than something that might give off light on its own.17 In the Bavli, B. Me. 87a reads: "Thereupon the qlaster of the face of Isaac changed and became just like that of Abraham" (nno5p 'Ir3: rn Dmnnti nrao- prnrs ti t:). The point of the passage is unambiguous: at that given moment, Isaac's face changed so as to appear exactly like Abraham's face. In the midrashic corpus, the term relates to the overall appearance of something; and in those instances that pair the term with "face," it connotes "one's countenance." The emission of light is not central to the idiom. The other difficult term is mpo'n, which Slotki unacceptably renders "servants." Jastrow relates this to the Greek toKcdptov, which he takes to mean "salver, saucer," citing this very passage.18 The usage is surely enig- matic, for the mashal (parable) would appear to be resolved in the nimshal (that which is being compared) by means of the words "created to serve." Apparently this misled Slotki. But it is surely not the "normal manner of things" for a person to make servants, and then, in the process of making a servant, form one more beautiful than the other. On the other hand, the creation of a platter, disk, saucer, or plate does make sense. The author of the midrash focuses not simply on the first man's foot and the sun, but rather on the spherical part of his heel (man) and the sun's overall round shape (b595). This particular passage happens to be very popular in the midrashic literature.'9 Language variants are hardly substantive, although a compari- son of the versions clearly reveals that a platter or plate of some sort is 'SGottstein does not treat either of these philological conundrums.

Indeed, the passage in Qoh. R. 8.2 con- structs one of the most interesting contexts for interpreting this midrashic unit. The lemma underlying the midrash is Eccl 8:2: "Who is like the wise man, and who knows the meaning of the word(s): 'A man's wisdom lights up his face, so that his deep discontent is dissembled."' The midrash reads as follows:20 "Who is like the wise man": This is the first man, as it is written concerning him: "O man (r't 1'). . . you were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and flawless in beauty; [you were in Eden, the garden of God. . .]."21 And "who knows the meaning of the word(s)?" [This refers to the first man who] could provide [an appropriate] name to [every living] thing.22 "A man's wisdom lights up his face." This means that his beauty lights up his face. Rabbi Levi said: "The ball of the first man's heel made the sphere of the sun [appear] dull. Do not be astonished. In the normal manner of things a man makes two complete disks (1Q9tDj 'ipor 'nt), one for himself and one for his household. Which one does he make more beautiful? Not the one for himself? So it was that the first human being was created for God's purposes and the sphere of the sun was made for the purposes of the first man. Is it not justified that the ball of the first man's heel should make the sphere of the sun appear dull? And if this is the case with the ball of his heel, with regard to the countenance of his face, all the more so." The passage is beautifully constructed and skillfully tied in with the exposition of Eccl 8:2. It is clear in this context that the word "shine" does not convey the notion that the first human being actually gave off light, but rather that he was extraordinarily beautiful. The first man is a corporeal being, but even his heel is more beautiful than the sun. This interpretation is also used in the highly exegetical parallel to this passage in Midrash Mishle (Proverbs). The Hebrew of the mashal is virtually identical to the versions already cited. I shall provide Burton L. Visotzky's translation, even though he very heavily relies on light-related vocabulary (which I am not convinced is warranted).23 Nonetheless, I believe that the essential meaning remains clear: God created the first human being with greater beauty-here communicated in terms of "light"-than the immensely pow- erful sun. This, of course, is counterintuitive, which is exactly why the 20Qohelet Rabbah or (as earlier printings called it) Midrash Qohelet, is usually dated after Leviticus Rabbah. See Johannes Wachten, Midrasch-Analyse: Strukturen im Midrasch Qohelet Rabba (Hildesheim: Olms, 1978). The logic of this particular reading is in many ways the most compelling of the versions. Apparently, this editor took it upon himself to improve those aspects of the parable and its resolution that seemed poorly done in earlier versions. 21Ezek 28:12. 22The reference is clearly to Gen 2:19-20. 23Burton L.

AARON 307 editor of Midrash Mishle chose 31:30 as his lemma to engage this mid- rashic unit. "Beauty is illusory": Adam's beauty was illusory, for as R. Simeon ben Menasya said, the heel of Adam's foot shone so bright that it eclipsed the sun. Now do not marvel [at this statement]. As is the way of the world, when a person makes two salvers, one for himself and one for a member of his household, whose does he make more beautiful? Not his own? Even so Adam was created to serve God, while the sun was created for the use of [God's] creatures. Is it not even more logical, then, that if his heel had eclipsed the sun, the radiance of his face should have eclipsed it even more so? Even with Visotzky's translation that emphasizes actual light emission (especially in his rendering of w;Tnr ;r as "shone so bright that it eclipsed"), it is evident that beauty is the primary concern of the passage. For the time being, I shall delay addressing the question of just how literal this "shin- ing" is in this particular passage. Visotzky portrays it as quite literal, im- plying that both the man's heel and face emitted light. I Was Adam's Body Really Light-Emitting, or Is This Figurative? With the Slotki translation of Leviticus Rabbah in mind, Gottstein ar- gues as follows: The body of Adam is more radiant than the sun. We have already noted the comparison to the solar effulgence in the homily of Pseudo-Clementine. Here it is the body of the created Adam, not the body of God, that outshines the sun. In other words, I would suggest that Adam is envisioned as possessing a body of light. This of course would shed new light on the physical understanding of zelem. One of the consequences of Adam's sin was the diminishing of his luminosity, along with the diminishing of his cosmic proportions [Gen. R. 12.6]. If the cosmic proportions of Adam are regarded as a description of this body of light, this difficult mythologoumenon takes on new meaning as well.24 As Gottstein reads it, the literature envisions Adam's original body as "light" just like God's, and perceives that the form of this light reflected the form of God's light-down to the details of circumcision.25 When Adam 24Gottstein, "Body as Image," 179; my emphasis. 25This brackets for a moment the independent question of how one can know that rabbinic Judaism believed God's body to be "light." It is, however, a serious problem.</page><page sequence="10">308 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is diminished (in Gen. R. 12.6), he loses his light-emitting aspect and either becomes or retains (Gottstein does not make the process clear) a physical body that does not emit light, although it still "reflects" the original divine form.26 Absent from Gottstein's discussion are the numerous texts that stand at odds with this "light-body" creation imagery, such as all of Gen. R. 8. In a footnote, Gottstein comments: "We lack a clear methodology for tying together different rabbinic dicta. Thus, we can only point to the possible connection between the cosmic dimensions of this body of light."27 Gottstein brings yet further methodological issues into focus with comments that almost immediately follow these remarks: This argument for the luminosity of the original zelem, based on the traditions concerning Adam, calls for a brief methodological reflection. In trying to refine our understanding of the bodily meaning of .elem, it is legitimate to turn to the legends describing the creation of Adam. It is he who was created in this zelem. We must ask, however, whether the connection between such descriptions and the concept of .elem is one that we supply, or whether the rabbinic sources connect these descriptions of Adam to his being a .elem of God. This doubt exists even concerning the rabbinic legends and myths appended to the verse, "Let us make man in our image." Are they merely commenting on the creation of humans, or do they uncover the meaning of the making of the human specifically in the image of God? Analyzing the Adam legend thus leaves us at an impasse. To get out of it we need to find texts-even younger rabbinic texts-that explicitly tie the notion of zelem to light-related terms. Several rabbinic texts refer to both zelem and light. These texts can help to substantiate our claim that the understanding of .elem as a body of light is possible within the rab- binic context.28 The questions posed by Gottstein are the right questions, but I have grave reservations about the proposed methodology. Given conflicting evi- dence, and the ever-nagging question of whether the texts intend primarily literal or figurative depictions, how can one proceed? Surprisingly, all that Gottstein brings as an "even younger rabbinic text" is b. B. Bat. 58a, and 26In footnote 28, Gottstein notes that Adam's luminosity is not one of the themes "estab- lished" in Genesis Rabbah with regard to Gen 1:26, although he does cite as evidence of the notion Gen.

AARON 309 nothing else. Theoretically, this whole issue of "younger" and "older" should not be a factor at all given Gottstein's own critique of Marmorstein's syn- thetic division between tannaitic and amoraic sources.29 So, despite a call for a methodological structure that would solve the "impasse," it remains unclear how one might achieve further understanding of the light imagery associated with the primal Adam. * What Can We Learn from These Images? I shall now attempt to summarize and place this material more fully in context. As noted, passages dealing with the image of God and humanity are relatively rare in rabbinic literature.30 The core question remains: If humanity is created in God's image, what does this imply about the way God looks?31 Instead of just taking the analogy for its surface meaning, thereby maintaining that God must have an appearance similar to our own, Gottstein begins searching for alternatives. As I noted earlier, he is inspired by a passage from the Jewish-Christian Pseudo-Clementine Homilies.32 The passage-probably dating from the early decades of the third century33-is worth citing in full. For He has a form for the sake of [His] first and unique beauty, and all the limbs, not for use. For He does not have eyes for the purpose of seeing with them-for He sees from every side; [for] He, as far as His body is concerned, is brighter beyond compare than the visual spirit in us and more brilliant than any light-compared to Him, the light of the sun would be held as darkness. ... He has the most beautiful form for the sake of man, in order that the pure in heart shall be able to see Him, that they shall rejoice on account of whatever they have endured.

The elipsis in Gottstein reads as follows in the 1951 edition: "Nor has He ears that He may hear; for He hears, perceives, moves, energizes, acts on every side." The main thrust of the homily is to convince the audience that even though God is incorporeal, He can have an impact on the physical world. 33See Johannes Quasten, Patrology (3 vols.; Westminster, MD: Christian Classics, 1990) 1. 62.</page><page sequence="12">310 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW own Form, in order that he shall rule and be lord over all things. And that all things shall serve Him. For this reason, he who having judged that He is the All and man His image-He being invisible and His image, man, visible-will honor the image, which is man. One understands why Gottstein was excited by this passage. Instead of focusing on the aspects that he discussed, I wish to draw attention to the rather remarkable homiletical affinities between this passage and the Qohelet Rabbah passage I have cited above. Placing a summary of the themes in parallel columns, the thematic structure may be compared as follows:34 Qoh. R. 8.2 Pseudo-Clement Horn. 17.7 This is the first man "You were the seal of perfection"35 "A man's wisdom lights up his face." This means that his beauty lights up his face. The ball of the first man's heel made the sphere of the sun [appear] dull. So it was that the first human being was created for God's service and the sphere of the sun was made for the service of the first man. [This is God] For He stamped man as it were with the greatest seal, with His own Form. For He has a form for the sake of [His] first and unique beauty.... He has the most beautiful form for the sake of man. [His body] is brighter beyond compare... more brilliant than any light-compared to Him, the light of the sun would be held as darkness. [I]n order that [man] shall rule and be lord over all things; and that all things shall serve him. It is entirely possible that the parallels in this imagery are coincidental, but my sense is that the presence of four clearly articulated motifs reflects too great an agreement to have occurred by chance. Indeed, there may have existed a "haggadic matrix" that included very distinct underlying biblical 34The order of the ideas is not terribly significant. I have used the Qohelet Rabbah text as the base and simply indicated the parallels in the Homily, altering the order in which the items appear for the sake of this comparison. See n. 35 on the issue of order in a "haggadic matrix." 35Ezek 28:12.</page><page sequence="13">DAVID H.AARON 311 verses, as well as cosmic imagery. As I have noted in a previous study, in many instances, parallels of haggadic matrices tell us more about the choices of a given author than do the more common variants in textual parallels that occur within the midrashic corpus.36 There are two likely explanations of how these passages acquired their current form and content: (1) either both the Pseudo-Clementine author and the author of Qoh. R. 8.2 were heirs to similar sources that employed this matrix, or (2) one knew of the other. It will probably never be possible to know which scenario obtained. What remains important, however, is that they do not use this matrix in the same manner. Qohelet Rabbah makes no mention whatsoever of either God's image or the image of the first human being (and this goes for all of the rabbinic parallels, including Leviticus Rabbah as Gottstein cited). More- over, as I have tried to indicate, the concept of "light" would seem to be used figuratively, as indicative of beauty; not literally as indicative of effulgence. In contrast, the Pseudo-Clementine rendering is based on a metaphysics which understands the "light" to be quite true to reality. As such, any claim that the Leviticus Rabbah text and the numerous parallels convey the notion that Adam "is envisioned as possessing a body of light," goes well beyond the intent of the author of this passage. Alter- natively, if one wishes to posit the Qohelet Rabbah passage to be confrontative with respect to the Pseudo-Clementine matrix, one might further speculate that the author of Qohelet Rabbah consciously ignores the notion that God is light so as not to confuse anyone into thinking that Adam is also pure light (rather than a real person of blood and flesh). 36I explored this issue in my article, "Imagery of the Divine and the Human." Typically, the common midrashic form called petihta involves a cluster of discrete midrashic units strung together. Sometimes these discrete units appear in various midrashic anthologies; but at other times the discrete units appear to travel from one corpus to another clustered together with other parts of the petihta. I call such an occurrence a "haggadic matrix." When considering the mythology behind Gen. R. 8.1, it was possible to show that the haggadic cluster offered by the darshan ("expositor") actually surfaced in earlier texts, some nonrabbinic Jewish texts and other non-Jewish sources as well. When either of these instances is the case, we are no longer witnessing a mere "rabbinic parallel." There is nothing radical in the claim that midrashic framers borrowed from prerabbinic and nonrabbinic sources. What no one had fully explored previously, however, was that these borrowings often involved clusters of thematic material rather than just specific literary allusions. Since these clusters were actually found in sources whose ideological underpinnings were at odds with rabbinic thought, they may provide sig- nificant insights into the formation of midrashic compositions. I am now preparing more materials on this theme and hope to publish them in the near future. I chose the term "matrix" (the core substance within which or from which other things originate or develop) rather than just "cluster", for two reasons. First, the grouping of themes or discrete literary units was not always identical in every detail (some had fewer, or additions); second, the order of the units could be different, even if the components were all paralleled. Since the core of the cluster would be intact, however, it could be seen as part of a broader mythology.</page><page sequence="14">312 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Indeed, the Platonic division between body and soul, so very dominant in the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies, does not underlie the theology of Leviticus Rabbah, Genesis Rabbah, or the later Qohelet Rabbah.37 This fact does not imply that light imagery cannot serve as a paradigm for a superior form of beauty. I only wish to show that there is not a universally distributed theological premise regarding the "light" of Adam's body. What then, might be the purpose of Gottstein's concluding statements: An examination of rabbinic myths regarding the creation of Adam. .. reveals that the meaning of body is not necessarily the physical body with which we are acquainted. Adam's body is a body of light. Thus, the divine form would also be conceived of in anthropomorphic, al- though not necessarily corporeal or physical terms.38 Why would one wish to make a general statement about rabbinic theology (such as: "Adam's body is a body of light") when other texts present a contrary viewpoint? Perhaps there is some theological imperative motivating Gottstein to force his collage of rabbinic texts to supply a divine body that is other than corporeal, other than identical in form and substance to the human body. When approaching the question, "Does God have a body?" Gottstein notes that no text in the entire corpus of rabbinic literature states anything to the contrary. When, however, he shifts to the question: "What kind of body does God have?" he does not draw the same conclusion, namely, that no text within rabbinic literature sets out to contradict the notion that God has a physical body that appears to be like that of humans. Why then seek divine and human bodies of light? The entire venture is doomed to create a theology that has no relevance to the world that produced the texts at hand. l Conflicting Images There is no question that within the vast array of rabbinic materials one can find imagery that posits God's body as light and even suggests incor- poreal human beings.39 This is especially the case in the hekhalot litera- 37This is not to say that the rabbis did not bifurcate the body and the soul; but the point is that their bifurcation did not function in the same manner as in Greek philosophy, at least as far as the midrashim cited here are concerned. See Boyarin, Carnal Israel, 31-60. 38Gottstein, "Body as Image of God," 195; my emphasis. 390n this issue see Alexander Altmann, "The Gnostic Background of the Rabbinic Adam Legends" JQR 35 (1944/45) 371-91; idem, "A Note on the Rabbinic Doctrine of Creation," JJS 7 (1956) 195-206; Peter Schafer "Beresit Bara' 'Elohim: zur Interpretation von Genesis 1,1 in der rabbinischen Literatur," JSJ 2 (1971) 161-66; and idem, The Hidden and Manifest God: Some Major Themes in Early Jewish Mysticism (Albany: SUNY Press, 1992) 19, 73, 114. With regard to incorporeal human beings, I have in mind the concept of Enoch as Metatron and other images of human beings becoming celestial in nature upon ascension, as depicted in the pseudepigraphic literatures.</page><page sequence="15">DAVID H. AARON 313 tures (of uncertain date or provenance). In the mystical ascension texts, we repeatedly learn that one of the dangers of looking at God derives from the extreme brightness of the fire (or light, depending upon the sources) that is emitted either from God directly, or from his throne and surroundings. Indeed, one of the incantations ends with the phrase, "Praiseworthy is the eye that is nourished and gazes upon this marvelous light, a marvelous and exceedingly strange vision."40 The actual body of God in the hekhalot litera- ture is, however, probably other than just light. As Elliot Wolfson has noted, even though the Hekhalot Rabbati and Zutarti materials do not "opt for the extreme anthropomorphic characterizations found in the Shi'ur Qomah recensions," it must ultimately be recognized that "the divine glory as a luminous form is predicated. . . on the attribution of an anthropomorphic shape to that form."41 In short, even in the context of mysticism, where God as light is a prevalent motif, it is still impossible to sidestep the issue of God's having an actual body whence the light derives, very similar in form to the human body. There are motifs among the exegetical texts that reflect this imagery, but again, broad generalizations only distort the evidence. Gen. R. 1.6 (on the basis of Daniel 2:22) posits that there is light within every righteous human being; the same passage avers that God emits the primal light directly. Gen. R. 3.4 discusses God cloaking himself in light, a disclosure that prompts some surprise among the rabbinic contemporaries. The highly metaphysical and cosmogonically-oriented passage of Exod. R. 15.22, however, sidesteps the opportunity to associate God with light. Instead, it portrays light as deriving from a primal substance, fire. In short, the complex nature of this theme requires a balanced consideration of a great array of passages that relate not only to God's image and corporealism, but to the notions of creation and light itself. A potpourri of texts from the entire corpus will ultimately produce whatever theological construct the interpreter wishes to find. Selecting texts means ultimately creating theology, not describing the ideological world that dominated in the past. When scholars search "for a way in which seemingly contradictory statements can be reconciled when no conscious attempt at reconciliation is made by the sources themselves," they are ac- tively working against the very conceptual structure of rabbinic literature. More attention should be expended in trying to define the relationship between midrashic writings and rabbinic beliefs. I believe that the only viable models will prove to be nonlinear in structure and fundamentally at odds with contemporary conceptualization of what comprises theology. Such 40Peter Schafer, Synopse zur Hekhalot Literatur (Tubingen: Mohr/Siebeck, 1981) ?160. 41Wolfson, Through the Speculum that Shines, 86-87.</page><page sequence="16">314 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW models will have to seek to elucidate the "semantics" of rabbinic theology. By that, I mean that one should view rabbinic theology as a generative system that creates meaning through its own conceptual rules. Embedded within those rules will be the rubrics that allow seemingly contradictory statements of fact and fancy to stand side-by-side. By shifting the emphasis from theology as belief statements to theology as a hermeneutic activity, it should be possible to come closer to the intents of the rabbinic authors, and in the process, to abandon modem prejudices regarding theological dis- course. Until these models are fully worked out, scholars can either force conciliation upon that which is by nature irreconcilable, or they can ap- proach the literature with a certain intellectual wariness.</page></plain_text>
