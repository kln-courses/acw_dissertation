<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS A COGNITIVE SCIENCE OF RELIGION E. THOMAS LAWSON It is difficult to miss the fact that the last fifty years has given birth to a revolution in the sciences. This revolution has not only transformed the way scientists theorize about the human mind but the means they have devised to test their theories. Cognitive science, which has emerged in the context of this revolution, has coordinated, distilled and extended the particular explanatory theories of human cognition provided by cognitive psychology, cognitive anthropology, linguistics, artificial intelligence (AI), philosophy, neuroscience and computer science. It has even begun to operate within the context of comparative religion. The purpose of this contribution is to discuss the relevance of cognitive science for the study of the religious ideas and practices of humankind by pursuing three questions: 1) Is a cognitive science of religion possible? 2) Is a cognitive science of religion necessary? 3) Is a cognitive science of religion emerging? Is A Cognitive Science of Religion Possible? Theorizing about religion as a cultural system is standard fare in the social sciences and has also had a great impact on studies in the humanities. Theorizing about religion as a set of cultural phenomena from a cognitive perspective is a more recent development. In fact, in many respects a cognitive approach to cultural phenomena such as religion is quite novel, and because of such novelty, capable of arous- ing intense suspicion and even antagonism. One of the main reasons for such a response to this new science has been the inevitable sus- picion aroused whenever scholars make appeals to psychological ex- planations of socio-cultural phenomena. The standard assumption in the social sciences and the humanities has been that only social and cultural methods can explain social and cultural facts. Of course the possibility of a cognitive science of religion depends upon showing ? Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden (2000) NUMEN, Vol. 47</page><page sequence="2">Towards a Cognitive Science of Religion 339 that cognitive explanations of socio-cultural facts not only are possible but have already happened. If cognitive science has already been suc- cessful in developing interesting, powerful and empirically tractable theories of one cultural form then that success certainly would have relevance for a science of other cultural phenomena such as religion. And it is no longer much of a secret that a cognitive science of lan- guage, an eminently cultural phenomenon, is in full bloom and has been since the fifth decade of the twentieth century. Ever since the pub- lication of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures (1957) the cognitive study of language has made astonishing progress. Explanatory theories abound at the phonological, syntactic and semantic levels of analysis. (For a recent popular account of the cognitive revolution in the study of language see Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct [1994].) In earlier theorizing about human languages one feature of lan- guages which had seemed to pose problems for cross-cultural general- izations had been their seemingly endless variability. Such variability seemed an obstacle to systematic study whether one focussed upon the differences in sounds, the differences in word order, or the differences in meaning. The variety of languages and language forms in the world is immense not even taking local dialects into consideration. It would seem that no one scholar could ever hope to develop a significant com- mand of all of these languages. So how could one produce a theory unless one had command of all of the facts? Scholars of religion who are equally cognizant of the great variety of religions and religious forms could take comfort in the massiveness of religious variety and settle for something less or something other than generalizations about religious phenomena. So if, despite such variation, a cognitive science of language has in fact emerged this gives scholars of religion hope that a similar cognitive science of religion could be developed. Another feature of language worthy of note to scholars of religion is that, such diversity notwithstanding, the cognitive study of language has led to the development of theories about the underlying structure of language. Such study has revealed that deep down languages are not that different from each other. In fact not only have cognitive scientists developed powerful competence theories of the phonology, syntax and</page><page sequence="3">340 E. Thomas Lawson semantics of human languages but they also have been successful in the discipline of pragmatics (see Sperber and Wilson, Relevance, 1986) where matters of performance take precedence over theories of linguistic competence. As the result of such studies in pragmatics we now know much more about the structure of communication than we did before. What the cognitive science of language has shown is that beneath the variability of language there is a commonality, or to be more precise, a set of principles which accounts for the complex character of linguistic phenomena. It is not variable all the way down. In fact on the syntactic level of analysis linguists have been able to demonstrate that there are certain universal constraints (known as Universal Grammar) on the formation of particular grammars. Beneath the surface complexity of human languages lies a set of principles which organize the sequences of words that make up sentences in quite specific ways. The result has been the development of interesting theories about the trajectory from sound to meaning. The fact of the success of linguistics, therefore, is an existence proof of the possibility of a science of at least one form of culture, namely language. A cognitive science of religion would be possible if it could be shown that despite the obvious variability of religion across cultures and throughout history there lay a similar specifiable commonality. In the third section of this paper we shall address the evidence for such commonalities in the emerging cognitive science of religion. Is a Cognitive Science of Religion Necessary? Let us concede for the moment that a cognitive science of religion is possible. Such a concession does not, however, make it necessary for scholars of religion to actualize the possibility of a cognitive sci- ence of religion. Not every road that beckons need be trod. In a world of many options perhaps there are better journeys to take. Why not, instead, continue to do what historians and anthropologists of reli- gion have done so well? Our shelves are filled with careful histori- cal studies of the development of particular religious traditions, fine grained ethnographic studies of various societies, sophisticated philo-</page><page sequence="4">Towards a Cognitive Science of Religion 341 logical studies essential for grasping the connotations and denotations of esoteric texts, powerful contextual studies of particular features of religious traditions, trenchant studies of the relationships between re- ligious systems and political or economic systems. and even postmod- ernist critiques of the very possibility of objective scholarship of any kind in the human sciences. All these endeavors have contributed to a greater or lesser degree to our understanding of religious ideas, the practices they inform, the institutions they engender and the controver- sies they generate. So why not stay the course and ignore the revolu- tion? Actually, no particular line of scientific inquiry is ever necessary. Refusing to engage in any kind of inquiry is always an option. And even science itself, as a highly specialized enterprise does not require our commitment. Although human beings are gifted with inquisitive minds it is quite possible to keep such inquisitiveness at bay and within bounds. Many individuals and groups of people have been and con- tinue to be quite successful at restraining their inquisitiveness. And at times in human history inquiry into the nature of the physical world has been suppressed. At different times and places various social institu- tions have demonstrated at least an ambivalent attitude toward science, and on occasion, an active hostility towards it. Furthermore it is only when such inquisitiveness is institutionalized and its development en- couraged and supported with adequate resources that the sciences be- gin to bloom. Societies with only a rudimentary science have existed in the past and could exist again. There are no guarantees (see Robert N. McCauley, "Comparing the Cognitive Foundations of Religion and Science," 1998) that science will remain as a viable way of acquiring knowledge about ourselves and the world we occupy. Human beings are quite capable of settling for rumor, gossip, innuendo, unsubstanti- ated reports, and propaganda. Such predilections might even confer an evolutionary advantage! But as part of the academy and wishing to see the discipline to which we have committed our lives make our knowledge of the world grow, there are good reasons for us to follow new paths of inquiry when they show promise of fulfilling our objectives. A sense of adventure</page><page sequence="5">342 E. Thomas Lawson might lead us into trouble, but sometimes the trouble is worth it if new discoveries beckon. So despite such cautionary statements I wish to claim that a cognitive science of religion is necessary (in the sense of worthy of being done) because it will help lead us into deeper insights about symbolic-cultural systems such as religion. A cognitive science of religion certainly shows every promise of deepening our understanding of the cognitive constraints on cultural form. Those who are dedicated to cultural relativism and its cousin cultural determinism often give the impression that there are no limits either on the contents of our minds or the cultural products that issue forth from them. We have come to see through the insights of cognitive science that this is not the case. There are limits to cultural (and, a fortiori, religious) variability. Of particular importance to the discipline of the history of religions at this time is the development of explanatory theories of religion by scholars who are not only tuned to the sciences but also have a deep knowledge of religious traditions. In our study of these religious tra- ditions our discipline has typically been long on interpretation and short on explanation. In other words we have been focussed more on problems of meaning and significance than problems of structure and cause. Making explanatory issues more central to our discipline (with- out denying the values of interpretation) promises to redress the imbal- ance between interpretive and explanatory concerns by deepening our understanding of the structure, acquisition, transmission and commu- nication of religious ideas and the practices they inform. So a cognitive science of religion is necessary if we wish our knowledge of the sys- tematicity of cultural forms to grow and especially if we desire more penetrating explanations of the structure and causes of religious ideas and practices. Is a Cognitive Science of Religion Emerging? As I have already argued, the best way to deal with the question of whether something is possible is to show that it has already been done. (In fact, the international journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences recently published an article by Justin Barrett "Exploring the Natural Founda-</page><page sequence="6">Towards a Cognitive Science of Religion 343 tions of Religion" on the new cognitive science of religion [2000]). Some scholars who were interested in cultural phenomena such as re- ligion and who had been paying close attention to the birth of the new science of the mind decided that it was worth employing the strate- gies of the cognitive sciences to religious materials. They decided to rethink religionswissenschaft by suggesting cognitive explanations of phenomena that had largely resided within the province of hermeneu- tics. So, for example, Dan Sperber reexamined issues concerning sym- bolism and meaning in Rethinking Symbolism (1975). In that by now classic work Sperber not only showed the weakness of semiotic ap- proaches to the study of cultural forms, but he also showed that spe- cific cultural activities such as the widespread use of symbolism are evidence of specific mental abilities each of which need to be dis- tinguished from each other and each of which have a causal role in cultural productions. In that book he was able to at least highlight the differences between dictionary, encyclopedic and symbolic knowledge and to demonstrate important properties of the latter. Sperber turned our attention to the variety of cognitive mechanisms we need to iden- tify and describe if we are to have any hope of developing new and interesting theories about the cultural life of human beings. One of the most interesting things about any scientific theory is that you never know whether what you are describing is going to be relevant to anything or not. A case in point are the many alternative geometries that mathematicians have constructed over the centuries which seemed to have no relevance to the world as we know it. And then in the twentieth century it became apparent that such geometries were very useful indeed to modem physics. By adopting a cognitive perspective Dan Sperber was able to make us rethink not only symbolism but the mind that produces it. (See Lawson "Religious Ideas and Practices," 1999.) Rethinking symbolism led to the challenge to rethink religion, and more specifically to rethink how we go about studying religion from a cognitive scientific perspective. Suddenly a science that seemed only of marginal significance to cultural phenomena was seen to be capable of playing a major role in explaining religion.</page><page sequence="7">344 E. Thomas Lawson Cognitive science is the study of the set of processes by means of which human beings come to know the world (Lawson, "Cogni- tion", Guide to the Study of Religion, 2000). To the extent that reli- gious knowledge counts as knowledge (and why should it not?) then whatever we have discovered about such processes certainly should be relevant to our study of religion. No one can deny that the contents of human minds are influenced by cultural processes. The issue is to de- scribe and explain what is going on when our minds in their interaction with cultural phenomena create, employ and transmit concepts of any kind including religious ones. The emerging cognitive science of religion has focussed on three problems: 1) How do human minds represent religious ideas? 2) How do human minds acquire religious ideas? 3) What forms of action do such ideas precipitate? Religious Representations Philosophers of religion, theologians, historians of religions and even anthropologists of religion have sometimes argued that religious concepts are sufficiently different not only from each other but also from all other ideas to justify special analyses. Some such analyses have been conceived of in such radical terms that they have insisted that special experiences, special commitments, special methods and even special mental spaces are required in order for religion to be understood. An alternative approach would be to show that our or- dinary, natural cognitive resources are sufficient to account for reli- gious ideas. In Rethinking Religion: Connecting Cognition and Cul- ture (1990) Lawson and McCauley were able to show that such is the case for at least those religious representations about religious ritual action. That work argued that our cognitive resources for the repre- sentation of action were sufficient to account for the representation of religious ritual action. Since that work a great many further accomplishments in the cog- nitive study of religion have appeared. For example, Barrett and Keil (1996) showed experimentally that when people engaged in theolog- ical reflection (no matter which society they lived in) they tended to</page><page sequence="8">Towards a Cognitive Science of Religion 345 produce "theologically correct" formulations of the properties of their deities. However, when presented with stories of the gods and when being called upon to remember what they had been presented with, people tended to systematically mis-remember these properties of the gods. So, for example, while their theological thoughts of the gods rep- resented them as being everywhere, nevertheless their recall of items in the story showed that they represented the gods as being in a specific location at a specific time. Evidently, human beings have deep intu- itions about what agents are like. Agents are spatially and temporally bound. Even though peoples' theological reflections suggested rather unusual properties of a special class of agents, superhuman agents, nevertheless their ordinary intuitions overrode the contents of such ab- stract, "off-line" reflections. One should not be surprised, therefore, that the gods are so frequently represented in anthropomorphic ways in religious narratives. Pascal Boyer (1994) has further developed this notion of the use of our ordinary cognitive resources for religious representations by his groundbreaking work on intuitive ontologies. To have an intuitive ontology is simply to possess a set of expectations of what the world is like. In the terms of our intuitive ontologies the world is a place where solid objects do not pass through each other, where living things require food to survive and grow, where animate things have goals, where agents have thoughts, and where artificial things do not come naturally - they have to be made. What Boyer has shown is that in order to have religious representations these ordinary expectations about what the world is like only have to be violated in minimal ways, for example either by violating only one of the assumptions of the ontological category involved or by transferring one of these assumptions from, one category to another. Take, for example, the ontological category "person". Our ordinary expectations about persons are that they are intentional, biological and physical agents. Violating only the physical assumptions about agents delivers the concept of a superhuman agent conceived of as intentional, and living being but without a body.</page><page sequence="9">346 E. Thomas Lawson Acquisition and Transmission It is one thing to develop theories of how religious ideas are represented. It is another thing to account for how they are acquired. On the face of it it would appear that, in the competition for ideas that make a difference to our understanding of the world, ideas about superhuman agents without bodies would hardly make the grade. Why have such preposterous (or, more gently, "counter-intuitive') ideas not been eliminated a long time ago? Here, actually, is an area in which the cognitive science of religion has already made a contribution to cognitive science in general. What Boyer and others have been able to show is that in the processes of cultural transmission counter-intuitive ideas have a mnemonic advantage. In simple terms, ideas in which certain properties of our intuitive ontologies are violated are more memorable than ideas which contain no such violations. What Boyer has shown via the notion of a cognitive optimum is that in order for a religious idea to survive it requires two things. An idea needs to have the properties that any idea has, and it also needs something to make it stand out from competing ideas. Now what we have learned from cognitive science is that the human mind acquires concepts in surprisingly complex ways. Developmental psychologists, for example, have shown that children actively construct their theories of what the world is like from the moment of birth. Rather than being blank slates which have information scribbled on them by the invisible hand of culture, children's minds show evidence of evolutionary design by their complex functional organization. Human minds have many competencies equipped to handle many domains of information. While, strictly speaking, there is no particular or special domain of religious information, human minds are so designed that they are responsive to certain kinds of information that capture human attention because of their memorability. Religious Ritual Action Lawson and McCauley (1990) have shown that the representation of religious ritual action depends upon quite ordinary action represen- tations. The main thing that distinguishes religious ritual action repre-</page><page sequence="10">Towards a Cognitive Science of Religion 347 sentations from ordinary action representations is the assumption that the agents involved in the action possess special qualities. So the ba- sic action structure of a religious ritual is "someone does something to someone or something with a particular consequence and by means of a particular instrument." In order for such an ordinary action descrip- tion to count as a ritual action description is to show that the agency involved possesses special qualities. Boyer's work about the minimal violations of intuitive ontological categories provides the means for explicating what makes such agents capable of being conceived of a superhuman agents. The special qualities of the agents presupposed in religious ritual action are that they violate some of the assumptions or- dinarily associated with ordinary agent. But equally important, most of the properties of such agents, and the inferences that can be drawn from them are the properties and inferences that we would normally associate with any agent. What we should also not miss about religious ritual representations is that they make it possible for certain things to get done that would not otherwise get done! The issues are not just ontological but also causal. Religious representations make it possible for people to devise special ways of bringing about new ways of associating with each other in social ways, hence the widespread practice of rites of passage. The big story is that cognitive scientists are beginning to unravel the mysteries involved in the cognitive processes which make such causal representations possible. A cognitive science of religion is obviously still in the process of development. It has demonstrated its ability to encourage interdis- ciplinary work, for example, among anthropologists, psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists and historians of religion. A new generation of scholars working in different disciplinary contexts are transgressing the boundaries of these disciplines and communicating with each other across those boundaries. Conferences involving cogni- tion, culture and religion are beginning to occur quite regularly and the proceedings of such conferences are rapdily moving towards publica- tion (see, J. Andresen, Religion in Mind, [in press]) and a new journal, The Journal of Cognition and Culture (published by Brill Academic</page><page sequence="11">348 E. Thomas Lawson Publishers) will begin publication in 2001. The cognitive science of religion that is emerging promises to disclose aspects of human reli- gions that, so far, have escaped explanation. Such explanations should find a warm welcome in the next generation of scholars of religion. Department of Comparative Religion E.
