<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN PAINTINGS ACQUIRED DURING THE LAST DECADE NUMBER 1. 1. John Singleton Copley (1738-1815) Hannah Loring, 1763 Oil on canvas, 126.4 X 99.7 cm. (49% x 39 Va in.) Gift of Mrs. Edsel В. Ford in memory of Robert H. Tannahill (70.900)1 Painted in the year of her marriage to Joshua Winslow, this magnificent portrait of Hannah Lor- ing (front cover and no. 1) illustrates all the splen- did abilities of the leading painter of Colonial America, John Singleton Copley. It was painted when the artist was only 25 and exemplifies the portrait of elegance at which he became so adept in the two decades preceding the Revolution. Copley, Winslow (1736-1775), and Miss Loring (1742-1785) were all natives of Boston, which, at the time this portrait was painted, was a small colonial city on the periphery of the British Em- pire, with about 16,000 inhabitants. Its leading citizens enjoyed great wealth, however, and con- sidered themselves at least the equals of the rich English merchants and landed gentry. Copley's great ability was to give these Boston aristocrats precisely such a view of themselves, basing his composition and techniques on those of London- trained painters active in the colonies at this time and on prints of comparable English portraits.2 Furthermore, his instinctive, particularly American directness of observation characterized his sitters in a way that escaped English-born painters in the colonies at this time. It was this forceful native quality, his increasing technical accomplishments, and his great prowess as a colorist, that estab- lished Copley's fame. 69</page><page sequence="2">NOTES (G. H.) The young lady's pose is sophisticated, with the gloved right hand tucked back on her hip and the body turned frontally from the hips upward so that the face is almost full. Her dress is fashionable, with lace ruffles, and a beautiful silk hat hangs at her side. Her expression is youthful, the scintillat- ing glance and playful smile being especially at- tractive. The colors are cool, as befits a young aristocrat, ranging from the ivory flesh tones and the ivory of the lace and hat to the flashing greens, grays, and blues of the dress. The abundance of young womanhood is appropriately 'suggested by the oval motifs, the face, the bosom, and the hat, with a larger oval formed by the light striking the face, going down the right arm, across to the left arm, and then back to the head, a movement rein- forced by the relationship of the red rose in her hand and the red flower in her headpiece. Joshua Winslow died shortly before the Revolu- tion and, being Loyalists, his widow and their six children left Boston shortly afterwards. She, ended her days in Canada, where the portrait remained in the family until the 1890s. At this time it was acquired by the Boston branch of the Loring family, where it remained until 1970. This portrait joins a most distinguished group of Copley's works - ten paintings and pastels - already owned by The Detroit Institute of Arts. It is one of the finest of all his early portraits, having much in common, for example, witFTthe portrait of Mrs. Benjamin Pickman (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven) also dated 1763.3 Mrs. Pickman - only 19 when portrayed, and two years younger than Miss Loring - has a similarly plump, oval face, ribbon at the nape of the neck, posy in her hair, and rich gown with the same "Watteau- drape" at the back. Several of Copley's portraits of this period show the figure in an outdoor setting, occasionally intimate in scale, such as that in which Hannah Loring is seen, but more frequently formal and grander than one supposes was avail- able in Boston at the time.4 This group of early portraits, where most of the sitters are quite individually characterized, shows Copley revelling in his newly-found command of painting rich stuffs, in complicated and ingenious poses, and in the eye-catching contrasts of light and dark. His use of bold color schemes was ex- ceptional for American painting of this time. Copley also completed pastel portraits of Joshua and Hannah Winslow and one of their sons about 1769.5 Years of child-bearing brought out the inci- pient physical qualities that Copley hinted at in the earlier portrait, and the pastel unhesitatingly reveals her as a stout Boston matron. 1.

Tannahill Foundation Funds (71.168)1 In 1766 Copley began a series of portraits of the 70 family of the deceased Thomas Boylston - his widow, two sons, and three daughters. Since the family was one of the richest merchant families in Boston, it was an auspicious commission for the young artist and it called forth some of his finest qualities. First came the widow, née Sarah Morecock, extremely well preserved at 70, su- perbly rendered in a very light brown satin dress with large white cuffs, white collar covered by black lace, and white cap. She is shown seated in</page><page sequence="3">NUMBER 2. 71</page><page sequence="4">an armchair upholstered with dull yellow damask against tasseled, dark green-blue drapery and a column. The portrait (now Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge) is a splendid example of controlled elegance and forceful ob- servation. Copley next painted, also in three- quarter length seated pose, her two sons, Nicholas and Thomas II (both Fogg Art Museum), the former dated 1767. Each is shown seated at his desk on a Chippendale, splat-back, side chair, wearing a turban on his shaven head and a sumptuous damask dressing gown. In pose and setting both portraits are more informal than that of their mother, but no less rich, apparently symbolizing an easy assurance in their demesne. At the same time came the portrait of Rebecca (later Mrs. Moses Gill), dated 1767 (Mrs. Paul Webster Bean, Auburn, Maine, on loan to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston); the posthumous portrait of Lucy (Mrs. Timothy Rogers), who had died in 1759 at the age of 33 (also Mrs. Paul Webster Bean, on loan to Boston); and Mary (Mrs. Benjamin Hal- lowed), shown at the age of 45. The spirited Rebecca stands at a fountain with a basket of flowers, a pose rather reminiscent of Copley's manner of about four years earlier al- though the allusion is obvious. Lucy is in a pose and chair very similar to that of her mother, look- ing as if she had indeed died some years before. Mary is seated similarly in a chair of red damask, looking directly at the viewer, with a pigeon poised on her raised left hand. The subject in the portrait has been placed close to the surface plane of the picture, creating a pow- erful sense of presence and reality. Her pose is quiet and completely assured. Large areas of pure color reinforce this mood: against the dark back- ground they are deeply resonant - the gold, pure to burnished, of the gown; the royal blue of the robe; the rich cranberry red damask of the up- holstery. The blue, white, and gray bird with out- stretched wings, and the fluffs of superbly painted lace give greater depth to the main colors by con- trast. The light falls strongly on the apex of the figure - the bosom and boldly modeled head. NOTES 1.

Jules David Prown, John Singleton Copley in America 1738-1774, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1966: 54-56, Comparisons with Hannah Loring (no. 1) should be evoked. The younger woman appears more scintillating and brilliant, more self-censcious, the colors more flashing, the more ostentatious mate- rials compensating for the less mature personality. The older woman seems more assured, more completely composed, more resonant, the colors richer, the impression more profound. It can be said that Copley did not express the indi- vidual qualities of the young and the mature woman more effectively than in these two splen- did portraits. They fit neatly within the museum's present holdings by Copley to give a superb repre- sentation of the range of his art. Mary Boylston married Benjamin Hallowell on June 13, 1746. In March 1764 he was appointed Comptroller of the Port of Boston. During the Stamp Act riots of 1765 he suffered severely from mob violence, since he was a highly placed gov- ernment official. His new house was damaged and some of the furnishings destroyed. About two years later he went alone to England for an ex- tended visit, during which time his wife and family suffered such repeated insults and abuses that his young daughter went mad and soon died. He re- turned to Boston ih September 1770 as Commis- sioner of Customs, but left in 1776 and, with a pension from the English government, ended his days in Canada. His confiscated American estate was regained by his descendants. Their oldest son took the name of his single uncle, Nicholas Boylston, in March 1770 at the age of 21, presum- ably in the hope of gaining favor and directing much of that gentleman's great wealth into his own pocket. It had precisely the opposite effect. Whatever estate he did have was, of course, later confiscated. He spent several years in the English army, with a loyalist pension from the govern- ment, and in 1800 returned to live in Roxbury, Massachusetts replete with pension. His portrait was painted twice by Gilbert Stuart. A second son of Benjamin and Mary Hallowell took his wife's name and later became Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell Carew of the Royal Navy.

(30 Ув x 25 in.) Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Manoogian (70.560)2 Brilliant and virile, the portrait of Col. Lewis re- veals Copley at the height of his painterly abilities. The striking pose, the strong contrasts of color, and the subtleties of modeling as defined by the raking light are all of exceptional quality. Copley b^sed the portrait directly on the figure of Col. Lewis he had incorporated into his huge history painting, The Siege of Gibraltar (Guildhall Art Gallery, Lon- don) (fig. 3a), which he had completed almost three years earlier. NUMBER 3. 73</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE За. The Siege of Gibraltar, 1783/1791, John Singleton Copley; oil on canvas, 543.6 x 754.4 cm. (214 x 297 in.). Guildhall Art Gallery, London. The intricate story of The Siege of Gibraltar has been well told by Prown and Howgego.3 It was commissioned by the Corporation of the City of London to honor General Eliott (later Lord Heath- field, see no. 6), commander of the garrison of Gibraltar, and Admiral Howe, who had com- manded the relief fleet in September 1782. Gen- eral Eliott had led the repulse of a massive Spanish and French attack on the garrison at the climax of a three-year siege. Copley won the commission in 1783, despite competition from his fellow American-born artist, Benjamin West, by suggest- ing a single, 25-foot long canvas for the Common Council Room, rather than the two that West pro- posed. Copley's fame was at its zenith at this time, so soon after the completion of his magnificent Death of Major Pierson (Tate Gallery, London). Having secured the commission, Copley worked for the next eight years to complete the task. After much preliminary research and consultation with the participants of this highly dramatic inci- dent, Copley decided on the composition and viewpoint of the picture. He chose the climactic episode when the British artillery had reduced the besieging batteries to flaming chaos, and General Eliott had ordered out soldiers in boats to capture the fleeting enemy boats, as well as to rescue those soldiers who remained aboard the explod- ing ships. Because of the obvious necessity to em- phasize the valor of the commanding officers, as well as the inherent artistic need to derive drama from the burning ships and the frantic struggles of 74 the soldiers, Copley chose to place the officers in the right foreground, while bringing the groups of burning, drowning, and fighting soldiers into the left middle-ground, as close to the viewer as was consistent with pictorial realism. The artist also decided to omit Admiral Howe (whose breach of the naval blockade of the garrison had played an important part in the relief from the siege) from the large composition, but then painted separate por- traits of him and Admiral Barrington to be hung on either side of the large composition. Col. Lewis was Commandant of Artillery at Gibral- tar during the siege. Copley placed him in the right corner, almost in the front line of officers. He is shown seated on the wheel of a cannon, the only man seen wearing the blue uniform with scarlet lapels of the Artillery. To his right is the figure of an officer with a telescope balanced on the cannon barrel, turning around, presumably to report what he sees. This latter figure is almost immediately below, but a little in front and to the right of the arresting figure of the Commander-in-Chief, Gen- eral Eliott, who is seated on a horse and dominates the group. Copley took great pains to portray the officers accurately, even traveling to Germany to obtain portrait sketches of the Hanoverian mercenaries present at the siege. Several oil sketches survive, the most striking being that of General Eliott (Na- tional Portrait Gallery, London). If a sketch of Col. Lewis was made at this time, its present where- abouts is unknown. But among the numerous</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 3b. Studies for " The Siege of Gibraltar."

Some of his drawings which concentrate on the figure with the telescope to Col. Lewis' right seem to show the colonel stand- ing,4 but Copley appears to have soon decided that he should be seated. Indeed, Lewis was also the only officer shown seated in George Carter's The Siege of Gibraltar, painted at the same time as Copley's picture and exhibited in London in 1785. 5 Copley made several changes in pose for the later half-length portrait now in Detroit. The most obvi- ous is the placement of the right hand, which is lower and holds the sword up in a strong diagonal, rather than down. Col. Lewis leans on a cannon barrel which is turned the opposite way from the large composition; this repeats the diagonal of the sword and the turn of the head. In the final version of the painting the sword and hand have been obscured by the flying coattail of another officer. Detroit's portrait gives the impression that the figure is standing. Copley's sure coloristic sense evinces itself in this picture - the brilliant scarlets of cuffs and lapels, the blue of the coat, the buff of the waistcoat, the dense blacks of hat and cravat, and the strong whites of the frills at the wrist and neck. As a marked contrast to these well-defined color areas is the turbulent, smoke and flame-filled back- ground. But the strong highlights on the hand and the frill at the neck culminate in the highlight on the face, which is subtly and beautifully modeled. Col. Lewis saw service in North America in 1757 as a First Lieutenant and later a Captain Lieuten- ant. He was in Havana in 1762, and arrived in Gibraltar in 1780 to replace the recently killed Col. Tovoy as Commandant of Artillery.6 (G.H.) NOTES 1. A receipt for payment, in Copley's hand, accompanies the paint- ing: Feby 1794 - Receit from J. S. Copley Esqr.

Francis Guy (с. 1760-1820) Carter's Tavern at the Head of Lake George , c. 1817/1820 Oil on canvas, 101 x 168.3 cm. (393Л x 66У4 in.) Robert H. Tannahill, Gibbs-Williams, and Merrill Funds (68.39)1 At the source of the American school of landscape painting of the 19th century, represented with such distinction in the Institute's collections, stands the work of a group of English-born painters who came to this country between 1790 and 1820 Francis Guy, Joshua Shaw, and William Wall, in particular, were responsible for the widespread dissemination in America of the English taste for picturesque landscape, both through their paint- ings and, perhaps more important, their engrav- ings. Collections of the latter were issued at the time as portfolios; Shaw's sketches were engraved by John Hill and published as Picturesque Views of American Scenery (1820-1821) while Wall's, en- graved by the same man and published by Henry J. Megary, became the famous Hudson River Portfolio (1821-1824). The effect of these exercises in the picturesque on native artists, especially the young Thomas Cole, generally regarded as the founder of the Hudson River school of landscape painting, is undeniable. Indeed, among Cole's early drawings and sketches are direct studies in "picturesque" composition. The cumulative effect of English picturesque theory and practice on the early development of America's native scfibol of landscape painting is grossly underrated and is only now being explored. Francis Guy came to America in 1795 at about the age of 35, within three years of other English land- scape painters who practiced their profession in this country in the subsequent decade - George Beck, William Groombridge, and William Winstanley.2 Guy settled in Baltimore from 1798 to 1817, then moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he died in 1820. He claimed to have been a pro- fessional silk dyer in England, and advertised as such in New York and Philadelphia; he was also listed as a dyer in the Baltimore Directories during his first years there, but by 1800 he was described as a landscape painter. Although he claimed to have been self-taught, he must have had some training in England, for his first known painting in this country is an accomplished work. His two best known pictures are not landscapes but rather urban views, dating from the beginning and end of his career. His earliest known American painting, the large View of the Tontine Coffee House at the Corner of Wall and Water Streets , New York (The New York Historical Society, New York) appears to have been painted in 1797-1798, while the large and rather damaged Winter Scene in Brooklyn NUMBER 4. 76</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 4a. View of Baltimore from Beech Hill, 1804, Francis Guy; oil on canvas, 77.5 x 121.9 cm. (ЗОУ2 x 48 in.) Maryland Historical Society, Baltimore. (The Brooklyn Museum) dates from about 1818. While in Baltimore, Guy painted many views of country houses in a vein as picturesque as the rather flat countryside would allow. One such was A View of Baltimore from Beech Hill (fig. 4a) done about 1804. It shows part of the estate of Robert Gilmor, Sr., the father of the famous collector with whom Cole later had differences of opinion on the artist's freedom to rearrange nature, an important part of the picturesque esthetic, and the resulting pictorial merits. It must be imagined that Guy was allowed no latitude in depicting the country seats of gentlemen who were probably yet to hear of the landscape theories of Uvedale Price or Payne Knight.3 Skies imposed no such restrictions, how- ever, and in most of his pictures the panoramic effect of drifting, broken banks of clouds is cer- tainly typical of the picturesque genre. Guy was criticized during his life for excessive dependence on engraved compositions, which indicates a popular familiarity with engravings in the pic- turesque manner (such as American prints gathered together into the later portfolios already mentioned, in addition to Enplish prints). Indeed, this whole doctrine or manner of landscape paint- ing became widespread through the medium of prints, which were eagerly studied by patron and artist alike and which undoubtedly lent a certain hard-edged character to much of the ensuing painting. Two exhibitions of the works that remained in Guy's studio after his death reveal the range of his artistic interests.4 Prominent among the titles are "scenes": "Forest Scenery," "Sunset Scenery," "Park Scenery," "Cottage Scenery." There are panoramic scenes such as Lake of Keswick (Eng- land) (304.8 x 182.9 cm. [10 x 6 ft.]), and Lake George , State of New Уог/с,(304.8 x 182.9 cm. [10 x 6 ft.]). The relationship is telling. Guy originally came from near Keswick, which was beloved of English picturesque artists and theorists, and later claimed to have spent many hours sketching there. There are many Hudson River views and other picturesque titles in the studio exhibitions, as well as such paintings as "View in the Style of Vernet," "Sea Piece - Style of Vandervelt," "Imita- tion of Claude Lorrain," and "View in Italy." Both exhibitions included a painting entitled "Car- ter's Tavern, Head of Lake George." This was later described quite fully in the review of one exhibi- tion by "Candor" in the New York Evening Post , of April 17, 1822: A large picture and an American sub- ject. The scenery around Lake George 77</page><page sequence="10">is highly picturesque, and this piece represents the most interesting portion of it. The commanding, large, com- modious public house, the tall poplars, blacksmith shop, winding, round ex- tensive lawn, numerous interesting and striking figures, and a view of the lake, are all good details, and with the vil- lage of Cauldwell [sic], its handsome church and spire, and adjacent hills, constitute handsome and appropriate fore and middle grounds. The view ex- tends across the head of the lake to the distance, where hills rise above each other till the vision is finally lost in an agreeable perplexity of objects. The sky and clouds, and the haze on the most distant hills, are appropriate. Upon the whole it is an admirable performance. To describe precisely those elements that make Guy's composition "picturesque" is not unduly simplistic, for there has been much confusion about such details from the earliest commentaries down to the profuse literature of the present day.5 Lakes, mountains, and woods were indispensible elements of picturesque composition - all here in abundance. The low viewpoint that the artist chose and the sense of extensive width conveyed were important characteristics. The raking light, indicated by the long shadows and suggestive of early evening, was also characteristic, giving, as it did, strong highlights and dense shadows, or va- riety and contrast . The forcefulness with which the raking light defines the objects in the fore- ground, the broken surfaces, and the rich coloris- tic contrasts were all important. Rather than human grandeur or the great achievements of mankind, the picturesque preferred homeliness or a sense of the more ordinary human pursuits (hence its dose identification with Dutch 17th- century genre and landscape painting); this was perfectly conveyed by the artist's choice of the tavern as the dominant point of the foreground. There are abundant necessary contrasts of subject matter - the tavern in the foreground and the church in the middle ground; the different kinds and classes of people in the foreground; the rather flat, precisely delineated middle ground and the misty mountains in the distance; the broken cloudscape. In Guy's treatment of the foreground is that element of linear precision already noted as being dependent on print sources. It seems appropriate to date this picture between about 1817, when Guy moved north to Brooklyn, and 1820, the year of his death. His recent re- moval to the area might account for the number of Hudson River views that were in his studio at the time of his death. The attainment of Guy and his contemporaries was to broadcast the realization that not only was American landscape, especially that of the Ameri- can interior (as the Lake George region was cer- tainly considered at the time) civilized, but it was also capable of being regarded as highly civilized, i.e., picturesque. The young Thomas Cole (and after him Thomas Doughty and Asher B. Durand) seized eagerly upon this idea as a means of de- veloping his artistic identity, putting into pictorial service his own deep feelings for nature. (G.H.) NOTES 1.

Gibbs-Williams Fund (70.61 6)1 Mather Brown was Boston-born and descended from the divines, Cotton and Increase Mather. Brought up and taught the rudiments of painting by his aunts, Brown was engaged in painting miniatures by the age of 16. He left Boston for England in 1780, stopping off in Paris where Ben- jamin Franklin gave him a letter of introduction to Benjamin West. Brown - as so many other young American painters of the time - benefited from the unfailing kindness and material generosity of the NUMBER 5. 79</page><page sequence="12">famous West, and by 1782 a portrait by him was chosen for exhibition at the Royal Academy.2 He exhibited every year thereafter until 1808 (except for 1804), and then from 1824 to 1831. Notable initially for portraits, he later exhibited history pic- tures and such subjects as scenes from Shakes- peare and Beaumarchais. But it was his portraits that made his name; he had promoted himself at first by "making portraits of most of the well- known characters in public life/' not from life, of course, but from other paintings or prints, working on the supposition that some of the renown would eventually rub off from the sitters to the artist.3 This saturation technique seems to have worked, for in 1788 he was appointed portrait painter to the King's younger brother, the Duke of York; by 1793 he was promoted to Historical Painter to the Duke. West, of course, had in 1772 been ap- pointed Historical Painter to the King, and was, therefore, the most prestigious painter in England, with the significant exception of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the President of the Royal Academy. Copley was also riding on the crest of his popular- ity in the 1780s; the success of the American triumvirate was not especially palatable to native artists. Brown's portrait of the 13-year-old Master Park(?) may conceivably be the "Portrait of a Boy" ex- hibited at the Royal Academy in 1784. The dam- aged date on the Detroit painting unfortunately does not provide proof of that supposition. The composition obviously owes a great deal to NOTES 1 .

Reynolds' portraits of the Morley and the Anger- stein children are good illustrations of this device.5 Furthermore, the pose of the boy and the use of strong raking light, which throws a deep shadow onto the lower part of the left leg and makes the anatomy so convincing, may also be derived from Reynolds.6 However, the fluidity of Brown's brush work seems to owe more than a passing debt to George Romney; furthermore, the pose may be directly derived from a Romney source, such as the portrait of the young William Beckford, or that supposed to be the young William Pitt.7 The first painting by Brown to enter the Detroit collections, the portrait of Master Park(?) reveals a skilled practitioner of the Royal Academy style. Brown followed exactly the same path as his fel- low countryman, Gilbert Stuart - a period of train- ing in West's studio (not nearly so extensive as Stuart's five years there), followed by the creation of portraits in the manner of Reynolds and Rom- ney. Stuart's full-length painting of The Skater , ex- hibited at the Academy in 1782 (now National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), received sub- stantial acclaim; and for the next four years, be- fore he suddenly left London for Ireland, his popu- larity remained undiminished. Brown's ambitious attempts to repeat the pattern of Stuart's success came to fruition, as we have seen, in 1788. To judge by the portrait of Master Park (?), such suc- cess was well deserved.

Romne/s full-length portrait of Beckford was painted about 1775 and descended in the family of the Duke of Hamilton, who was Beckford's son-in-law (H. Avray Tipping, "The Hamilton Collec- tion of Pictures," Country Life [October 25, 1919]: 514-516). The same pose was used for the portrait of John Bensley Thornhill, painted about 1784, and now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The portrait supposed to be William Pitt the Younger is in the Eari of Crawford and Balcarres' Collection and was painted about 1785. Brown's rise to fame is evinced not only by his appointment as portrait painter to the Duke of York in 1788, but also by the fact that such famous figures as General Eliott, later Lord Heathfield,</page><page sequence="13">NUMBER 6. agreed to sit for him. Lord Heathfield (1717-1790) had sat for Reynolds for the famous three-quarter length portrait exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1788 (now in the National Gallery, London), as well as for Copley in the course of that artist's preparation for The Siege of Gibraltar (see no. 3).2 It is no exaggeration to say that Lord Heathfield was the great military hero of the 1780s - a de- cade which desperately needed military heroes after the debacle of the War of American Indepen- dence. The successful repulse of the besieging Spanish at Gibraltar was the culmination of General Eliott's brilliant professional career as a soldier. Educated at the University of Leyden and the French military college of La Frère, he served in Europe for several years before becoming aide-de-camp to George II in 1756. His service in Germany (1759-1761) was highly distinguished. He subsequently served in France, Cuba, and Ireland, and was appointed commander of the strategically important garrison of Gibraltar in 1775, where he remained until 1783. It was his great firmness and resolve that enabled the English forces to withstand the three- year siege, although the French blockade by sea 81</page><page sequence="14">almost forced them to capitulate. Only the last minute break-through by Admiral Lord Howe saved them - a naval action of the utmost impor- tance. General Eliott received his barony for his great valor in this campaign. His whole career, in fact, was distinguished by devotion to duty and firm command, even to the extent of his being temperate and a vegetarian. Lord Heathfield was sitting for Brown at least as early as September 1788,3 yet the full-length por- trait (County Hall, Lewes, Sussex, England) was not exhibited at the Royal Academy until 1792, when it was mentioned that it was specifically NOTES 1.

Founders Society Activities Committee Fund (69.7)1 As close in treatment to a Whistlerian "Nocturne" as anything painted in America up to that time, Weir's beautiful The Hudson River from Hoboken is also notable as an early industrial landscape. It thus seems particularly appropriate for Detroit. Weir's concern with industrial motifs almost cer- tainly stems from the two grand pictures by his son, John Ferguson Weir: The Gun Foundry of 1 866 and Forging the Shaft of 1 8682 (The Putnam County Historical Society, Cold Spring, New York and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, respectively). Yet the father himself was not unin- terested in science, as is evidenced by his The Microscope of 1849 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven). The three pictures show a single arti- ficial light source illuminating a dark interior; yet in The Microscope there is a characteristic infu- sion of the antiquarian, such as the clothes and the cupboard. This obsession permeates Weir's art, so that, for example, at exactly the time he was paint- 82 ing The Hudson River from Hoboken , he was also "designed for Heathfield Park."4 There was at least one portrait exhibited at the Royal Academy pre- viously (1791, no. 241), which may have been the Detroit portrait. The painting is obviously a sketch for the full-length portrait, being virtually identical in all respects to the larger composition. It is characterized by a more resolute air of strength and firmness than the Reynolds portrait, which is quiet and dignified rather than forcefully heroic. The subtleties of modeling, the excellent, fluid brushwork, the highly keyed coloring, and the aforementioned strength of characterization all combine to make this a masterful image of a mili- tary hero.

The World , Sept. 9, 1788, stated:" Lord Heathfield, coming out of Brown the Painter's, had a fall on the pavement of Cavendish Square." (Information provided by Miss Dorinda Evans.) 4. Of course, there may have been more than one full-length por- trait; the World , Sept. 30, 1788, stated that "Brown's Historical Portraits of Lord Heathfield and Sir Robt. Boyd [the Governor of Gibraltar: R. A. 1791, no. 243] are not to go to Spain until they are copied." Later, Brown apparently changed the composition anyway: "Brown, since the recovery of Lord Heathfield, has totally changed the arrangements of his grand Gibraltar Picture" (Victoria and Albert clippings, II: 453, Oct. 1788). (Information provided by Miss Dorinda Evans.) working on "Columbus Before the Council of Salamanca," "Titian in his Studio," "Portia at the Palace of Octavia," and "Virgil and Dante Cross- ing the Styx."3 The Hudson River from Hoboken is of a predomi- nantly mauve tonality, resulting from the smoke, the mists rising from the river, and the evening light. The only elements of the painting not mauve or black are the glints of moonlight illuminating the steam, and on the canvas covering the barrels, on the back of the dog, and the lights glimmering from across the river. The painting is strongly rem- iniscent of the work from the preceding decade by Weir's most famous pupil, Whistler. Yet there is no evidence of contact between the two artists at this time, except through the medium of Julian Alden Weir, who was not impressed with Whistler.4 Weir described his painting to a newspaper re- porter as follows: Here is a view I took from my window in Hoboken a year ago. It is just eve- ning, and you see the gleafti of lamps on the opposite side of the North River.</page><page sequence="15">It is a dim light and a somber picture, but those coal barges are typical of that particular wharf.5 Such quiet understatement seems typical of Weir's NOTES 1.

William Rimmer Victory, 1870 Oil on canvas, 51 x 58.6 cm. (20 x 27 in.). Dexter M. Ferry Jr. Fund (69.293)2 Long regarded as a painter of incomprehensible Victorian riddles, William Rimmer is currently being reevaluated by several scholars. From a study of more than 160 paintings, drawings, and sculptures in the major Rimmer collections, Maria Goldberg has concluded that subjects treated by Rimmer were often pertinent to his time and that frequently the mode used to express these subjects was allegorical.3 Detroit's Civil War Scene and Victory , two recent acquisitions, are perhaps better understood in light of this interpretation. Rimmer was born in Liverpool in 1816. His father, Thomas, believed himself to be the lost dauphin, eldest son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and the rightful heir to the throne of France. Whether or not this was true, the entire family seems to have shared the father's conviction.4 Fearingnhat Louis' aged brother might wish to eliminate any rivals for the throne, Thomas left England shortly after William's birth, taking his wife and infant son to the New World. They eventually settled in South Boston. Thomas Rimmer had been educated in a manner befitting a prince. Although all his life he harbored resentment against his reduced circumstances, he was nonetheless able to benefit his children with his extensive knowledge of music, art, languages, and history. Thus, although he later made his liv- ing as a physician, William Rimmer received early encouragement to be an artist. One small gypsum figure of remarkable emotional intensity survives from his boyhood. Entitled Despair (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), it is thought to have been in- spired by his father's unhappy personal history. Also surviving from this period are several fine pencil sketches for a poem he wrote called "The Midnight Ride." Both the poem and the sketches illustrate the direction of his imagination and his early disposition to create highly finished draw- NUMBER 8. 84</page><page sequence="17">ings. He later carried this tendency so far as to execute them with the aid of a microscope.5 The facts of Rimmer's artistic life have been well documented by Truman Bartlett, and later scholars generally agree that Rimmer was not only a pow- erful draftsman, but a learned anatomist, an inspir- ing teacher, a highly imaginative painter, and the most gifted sculptor of his time in America. Ex- cerpts from Rimmer's own writings reveal that he had a strong bent toward socialism, probably the result of his many years practicing medicine among the poor laborers of rural Massachusetts; and that he admired Catholicism, Michelangelo, and William Blake.6 Well versed in classical and Biblical literature, he made frequent use of alle- gory in his work, and had a neo-classical tendency to draw upon the past for edifying models. A 1973 gift of Dr. and Mrs. Sheldon Stern, Civil War Scene (no. 8) depicts the aftermath of battle in a green meadow. Despite its romantic coloring and mood, it is a relatively straightforward con- cept of military conflict. Though the painting is undated, the Union uniform worn by the figure on the left, and the Confederate grey of the dead fig- ure to the right of the horse, clearly indicate that the subject is the Civil War. In the collections of the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cam- bridge, is a related pencil sketch on lined note paper entitled Soldier and Horse Under a Tree (fig. 8a). Inscribed by the artist, " To my Mother at home , "the soldier is described on the accession card as "apparently writing a letter." When com- pared to Detroit's finished painting it becomes clear that the soldier is actually studying an object he holds in his left hand, either a time piece or more likely a miniature of a loved one. Judging from Rimmer's above noted inscription, it is pos- sible to assume that the miniature the soldier gazes upon so intently is a representation of his mother.7 Offering a counterpoint to Civil War Scene and typical of Rimmer's allegorical treatment of the subject of warfare, Victory (no. 9) was purchased in 1969 from the estate of Paul Grigaut, who for many years was curator at The Detroit Institute of Arts. While the palette and mode of expression are very different in the two paintings, both are nearly FIGURE 8a. Soldier and Horse Under a Tree, William Rimmer; graphite on ruled paper, 14 x 19.1 cm.

In addition, both canvases have the same greyish, preprimed ground, and a comparison of the X-rays of both paintings dis- closes the canvases to be identical in weave and threadcount.9 These facts have led several scholars to believe that the paintings may have been intended as pendants dealing with the Civil NOTES 1.

Ferry Jr. Fund (70.61 7)1 The first painting by Cropsey to enter the Detroit collection, this marvelous small sketch depicts a panoramic sunset scene in the Catskills. Painted with a freedom and control and a subtlety of color- ing that are quite remarkable - and unusual for this artist - the picture has such qualities that it might, without pretension, be seen as a small- scale and more intimate version of one of the most powerful and satisfying of all American landscapes - Frederic E. Church's Twilight in the Wilderness (Cleveland Museum of Art), also dated 1860. The sketch was painted in the same year as Cropsey's elephantine Autumn on the Hudson River (274.3 x 152.4 cm. [9x5 ft.]), which made his reputation at the time, but which, to modern War, or part of a larger series the artist had begun but never completed.10 Rimmer exhibited so few pictures in his lifetime that few people at his death realized he had ever painted at all. Many of his canvases were ruined by the use of bitumin, and according to Lincoln Kirstein, his heirs seem to have attached little im- portance to those that were not.11 Consequently, hardly a sixth of his recorded paintings are known to survive, a fact which makes all the more rare Detroit's two superb canvases by this important 19th-century artist.

Cropsey spent the years 1856-1863 in England painting and exhibiting at the Royal Academy and selling profitably many American landscape paint- ings. For these pictures he must have used oil sketches, drawings, and watercolors done in situ in the years 1849-1856, between his two European trips, although his second trip was actually fi- nanced by the sale of about 100 oil sketches and drawings in 1856. If this sketch was in fact painted in 1860, Cropsey's imagination was not dulled by the elapsed time or distance, for it is vibrantly fresh and convincing. A comparison between it and the finished picture of 1861 (fig. 10a), for which it was partially a study, reveals that the beauty of the free handling in the sketch disap- peared under the tighter and more polished man- 87</page><page sequence="20">NUMBER 10.

(24 14 x 181/4 in.) Gift of Mr. and Mrs. James O. Keene (72.257)1 With the recent revival of interest in 19th-century American genre painting, Thomas Waterman Wood has emerged from a position of relative obscurity in the 20th century to take his place alongside other popular painters of his generation. Though he received some training with Chester Harding in Boston in the late 1840s, he was primarily self-taught. From 1852 to 1866 he painted portraits in New York, Quebec, Washing- ton, D.C., Baltimore, Nashville, and Louisville. In 1866, having received encouragement on several of his genre pictures, he settled permanently in New York and took a room in the Tenth Street Studio Building which housed almost every im- portant name of the time. His models added to the traffic up-and-down stairs of street urchins, char- women, and derelicts who came to pose for J. G. Brown (see no. 13), but it was Wood's sensitive portrayal of blacks in American life that brought him the most attention in his own lifetime and on which his reputation rests today. In a recent catalogue on the works of the artist in the collections of the Wood Art Gallery (Montpelier, Vermont), William Lipke noted that Wood had copied in his diary the following pas- sage from the writings of John Ruskin: "Dress exercizes a perpetual influence on character, lending in a thousand ways to increase dignity and self respect together with grace and gestures to induce serenity of thought".2 The quote is signifi- cant, for a study of the artist's portraits reveals his fascination with the material surface of things. There is no attempt to penetrate the personality of the sitter; instead he chose to define character by dress. This object orientation was further stimu- NUMBER 11. 89</page><page sequence="22">lated by the array of fine and industrial arts on view in New York the summer of 1853 at the Crys- tal Palace Exhibition. Wood read Goethe's Theory of Color (with notes by Eastlake) and looked criti- cally at the work exhibited by his American and European contemporaries. In 1858 Wood made two decisions that were to mark the turning point in his success as a painter. The first was to submit a genre study of Moses, The Baltimore News Vendor to the exhibition of the National Academy of Design, New York. The sec- ond was to leave America for study in Europe. Prior to sailing, he sold Moses and a companion piece of a black woman entitled Negress (fig. 11a) to his principal patron in Baltimore, J. C. Brune, who had previously commissioned portraits of himself and his family. (Both Moses and Negress are now in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco.) Once in Paris, he estab- lished a studio where he hoped to be able to pro- vide pictures "to order" for his Baltimore patrons, and he began copying paintings by Rembrandt and Murillo in the Louvre. Lipke noted from an entry in Wood's diary, dated January 19, 1859, a passage which describes the artist's approach to these genre compositions: ... he began painting in his atelier from an old woman ragpicker he found that morning near the Market of the In- nocents. "She is an admirable subject for a picture." The next day he painted from the model for more than four hours, and after she left, painted "from her hat which she left behind." Over the next five days, he concentrated on filling in the background details. He added a basket, sketched in a carved stone door jamb he'd [sic] discovered down the street and finally "painted a pile of dirt out of which my chiffon ¡ère is supposed to have found a silver spoon."3 Judging from this and other entries in Wood's di- ary, it is evident that his concern was not with storytelling as a verification of reality, but as an illustration of an idea which, in the above case, is a moral allegory of hidden value. Compo- sitionally, he began to build up a series of sketches which could be incorporated in various combina- tions into his genre pictures. While many of these small studies are complete entities in themselves, Wood regarded them as a catalogue of objects and environments - a kind of properties shop into which he could dip whenever he needed filling for 90 a story line.

Williams to the Mildred Anna Williams Collection. Photograph by The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Wood returned to America late in 1859 to find the abolition of slavery an immediate and pressing domestic issue. He painted some portraits during the next seven years, but devoted the greater part of his energies to the faithful recording on canvas of the black man's participation in the Civil War, the transition from slavery to freedom, and the quality of American citizenship for all ethnic groups. His paintings on these themes are among the most objective images of black Americans to be produced in the late 19th century. A comparison of the Serving Maid of 1890 with the earlier Negress illustrates the direction of Wood's artistic development. Both canvases re- veal his careful attention to surface detail; there is the same dramatic lighting and brilliant coloring in costume. But in the mature work the subject is presented much closer to the picture plane and is rendered with a minimum of brushstrokes in a de- cidedly less formal manner. Wood's respect for the properties of weight and volume and his insis- tence on the importance of each individual object here results in a moment captured and hermeti- cally sealed in time.

Ferry Jr. Funds (75.1 1)1 Painted for the 1882 Annual Exhibition at the Na- tional Academy of Design, Indian Summer repre- sents the high point of Jervis McEntee's develop- ment as a Hudson River school painter. This large exhibition presented the New York art world with a grandiose display of McEntee's melancholy vi- sion and extraordinary craftsmanship. Soon after its reception the painting was sold to James Pin- chot and remained in the Pinchot family until it was purchased by The Detroit Institute of Arts in 1975. McEntee's work sold steadily during his lifetime, yet he continually expressed disappoint- ment that he was not celebrated and patronized in the fashion enjoyed by his colleagues and inti- mates, among whom were Worthington Whit- tredge, Frederic E. Church, Eastman Johnson, and Sanford Gifford. Born and raised in 1828 in Rondout, New York, on the west bank of the Hudson River near the Catskills, the painter began his artistic career at an unusually late point in life. After a brief study with Church in New York City during the winter of 1850/1851, McEntee returned to Rondout to oper- ate a flour and feed business until its demise in 1858. The failure of the business led to the re- opening of his art studio in New York City. While McEntee spent the winters at this studio during the remainder of his life, the summers were reserved for Rondout and sketching trips along the Hudson. Two European tours, first in 1859 and again in 1868-1869, gave him the opportunity to sketch the landscapes of Italy and Switzerland and to gain a greater exposure to art on the Continent. Sanford Gifford accompanied McEntee on both trips, and Church joined them on the second Italian visit. The influence of Church and his microscopically detailed style is readily apparent in Indian Sum- mer. By temperament, however, McEntee was an heir to Thomas Cole and the emotional interpreta- tions he imposed on the landscape, in contrast to 2. William C. Lipke, Thomas Waterman Wood , exh. cat., Wood Art Gallery, Montpelier, Vermont, 1972: 34-36. ^ 3. Ibid.: 32. Church's greater objectivity. In many of his paint- ings McEntee aptly demonstrated his esthetic credo, "art for the expression of one's self."2 Al- most without exception, his somber feelings were reflected in the posture of trees and the tonality of his palette. From the beginning of his career, na- ture held for him melancholy associations with the passage of time. McEntee responded to the poetry of William Cullen Bryant, and often the artist painted scenes which corresponded to a particular passage from Bryant, for example, "The Death of the Flowers."3 The same somber sentiments continually reappear in his paintings. In mid-December of 1872 John Ken sett passed away, and the entire New York art world went into mourning. McEntee immediately set about painting a landscape dedicated to his memory. In his own words he described the sig- nificance of the work: It is looking out over a quiet but shadowy sea from the rough and rug- ged hills of Gloucester. A heavy curtain of solemn clouds hangs along the center of the picture with a quiet grey sky behind and along the far horizon stretches a band of light toward which a white bird is flying. Whittredge and Gifford are much interested in it but I have not told them what I mean in it. I think they feel it.4 The overt use of life/death imagery he describes in the painting was not unusual for him. McEntee became well-known in his own time for the mournful spirit of his typical autumn landscapes.5 In 1878 McEntee's wife, Gertrude, died suddenly after a short illness, which was diagnosed as Addison's Disease.6 Moreover, after 1878 his diary is filled with newspaper clippings reporting the deaths of friends and acquaintances, as time began taking its toll of McEntee's generation. By the spring of 1881 when he had begun Indian Summer , McEntee was still brooding over Ger- trude, re-reading her old letters to him, regretting 91</page><page sequence="24">the past, and thinking of her in everything.7 A note in his diary that "Pinchot called" on May 19th establishes that James Pinchot probably had seen the painting he was to purchase before it was ex- hibited at the National Academy of Design the following March.8 The psychological agitation experienced by McEntee during these years affected his style. Though his compositions had always reflected his own emotional tenor, his observation of details had been as scientific as that of Church. The con- tours of forms now became characterized by a nervous, broken edge, and Indian Summer with its foreground of jagged, decaying natural forms shows McEntee at a crescendo of emotional inten- sity. Looking through a spatially-compressed val- ley to the radiance beyond, the scene represented seems to paraphrase the earlier painting dedicated to the memory of Kensett.9 Emphasizing the tran- NOTES 1.

A traditional motif in the art of both Cole and Church is the large, anthropomorphic tree, which assumes a central role in the composition. Having survived the ravages of time, the cedar still stands firm and victorious amid the decaying remains of fallen trees. McEntee was straight- forward in explaining the purpose of his painting: In landscape, certainly, you can tell a certain kind of story ... I look upon a landscape as I look upon a human being - its thoughts, its feelings, its moods are what interest me; and to these I try to give expression. What it says, and thinks, and experiences, this is the matter that concerns the land- scape painter.10 (K.P.) NUMBER 12. 6.

John George Brown (1831-1913) Claiming the Shot : After the Hunt in the Adirondacks, 1865 Oil on canvas, 81.3 x 127 cm. (32 x 50 in.) Robert H. Tannahill Foundation Fund (73.226)1 One of the most talented figure painters of his day, John George Brown was extremely popular during the post-Civil War period for his paintings of rag- ged street urchins, particularly newsboys. Like his favored subject, he was of humble origin. He was born in Durham, England, the son of an unsuc- cessful lawyer, and was apprenticed at an early age to a glasscutter in Newcastle-on-Tyne. While learning his trade he studied painting with Scott Lowdes, and later with the English Pre-Raphaelite, William Bell Scott, in Edinburgh. After his arrival in America around 1855, he continued his studies under Thomas Cummings at the National Academy of Design, New York, where he ex- hibited for the first time in 1858. By 1860 Brown was able to rent a room at the Tenth Street Studio Building where he shared space with such important painters as John La Farge, Winslow Homer, Sanford Gifford, and Jervis McEntee. His success was almost immediate. A painting of a small boy entitled His First Cigar brought his work into national prominence when it was exhibited at the National Academy of De- sign that year, and thereafter the public demanded only genre subjects of this sort from Brown. That he could, and did, paint pictures which urged a moral response reflects the attitude of a generation for whom sentiment was the most important crite- rion of "ideal" art. But Brown by no means limited himself to that genre. He painted landscapes, fishermen, and other sporting pictures, as well as the aged of both city and country. The fact that his paintings of small boys were in such exclusive demand was a source of much personal unhappi- ness for the artist, and toward the end of his life he told a reporter that he kept his landscapes and portraits locked away from the public. "When J. G. Brown is no more,* he said, "those who come after me will be rummaging about this studio and they will discover scores of canvases which will show, I hope, that I was not a painter of one idea/'2 After his death in 1913 the contents of his studio were sold at auction, and as he had predicted, many of the canvases were a surprise even to his friends.3 They bore such titles as "The Sportsmen's Rest," "A Trout Stream in Vermont," "Camp in the Maine Woods," etc., and date from the 1860s and 1870s when Brown was in the habit of joining the second generation Hudson River school group, who shared his building, in their annual May es- cape to the countryside. Usually traveling to- gether, the artists pursued their study of nature NUMBER 13. 93</page><page sequence="26">until the autumn colors had faded from the Catskill and Adirondack hillsides. Sketches made on these camping trips served as the basis for large, finished landscapes executed during the winter months in their city studios. The careful drawing and close, unsentimental ized observation revealed in Claiming the Shot and other of Brown's atypical works, place him among the best artists working in the tradition of realistic and narrative genre painting. This carefully com- posed scene contains multiple points of interest; groups exist independently but relate to each other through a glance or a gesture. Landscape details are rendered with careful attention to their natural appearance, and the painting has the highly refined finish which characterizes all of Brown's important exhibition pieces.

While further research is necessary to establish the identity of Astor conclusively and to identify the other members of the group, there is good reason to believe that at least one other member of Astor's family is included in this group portrait. His youngest son, William Waldorf Astor, was 17 years old at the time, which appears to be about the age of the young boy on the left carrying the rifle. In later photographs of First Viscount Astor the re- semblance is very striking.7 Also bearing the Astor features is the seated figure at the far right, who holds a flask in one hand and a cup in the other. It is possible that this is John Jacob Astor Ill's younger brother, William Backhouse Astor Jr., aged 35 in 1865.8 As yet, there is no clue leading to the identity of the other members of the group.

On this trip he took with him as his sole companion a young South Carolinian painter of Huguenot stock, Louis Remy Mignot. Church especially wanted to see and sketch the volcanoes Cimborazo and Cotopaxi, as well as take a trip into the mountain wilderness to look for the little-</page><page sequence="27">known volcano Sangay. This whole trip was ex- tensively recorded in Church's diaries and has re- cently been published.2 The trip had an enormous influence on Church's art - his large canvases of the South American volcanoes could justifiably be called glimpses of the Apocalypse. On Mignoťs art the effect can have been no less immense, yet our knowledge of the range of his production is skeletal. Only from the exhibition record of the National Academy of Design, New York, can one see the change from such subjects as "Recollec- tions of Germany" and "Birth Place of Rembrandt" (both 1853, when the artist was 22) to "Among the Cordilleras" and "Twilight in the Tropics." Mignot was trained in landscape painting in Hol- land by Andreas Schelfout in the early 1850s, but it was his experience with Church that made his reputation. He was elected a member of the Na- tional Academy of Design in 1859 and was suc- cessful for a brief time before the Civil War forced him to leave the country. He settled in London and became a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy until his early death in 1870.3 It is temping to connect Detroit's picture, dated 1863, with a landscape exhibited by Mignot at the Royal Academy in the same year - "Lagoon of Guayaquil, South America." The dependencé^on Church is obvious: compositionally the painting is very close to Church's Andes of Ecuador of 1855 and The* Heart of the Andes of 1859 (both now in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The same panoramic mountains dominate the whole background, mounting toward heaven; the same trees are included in the left foreground with the dwarfed figures communing with their symbols of God; the same mists rise from the falls in the river in the center middleground; the same unbelieva- bly intense light emanates from the sun which hovers like a god over all. There is no confusing the painterly treatments of both artists, however. Mignot used much higher tonalities and distinctly more varied hues in his palette. It is almost pre- Impressionist. The color spectrum radiating from the sun, for example (not visible in a black and white reproduction), is extraordinary. It is as much a powerful profusion of color as Church's land- scapes are a profusion of effects.4 (G.H.) NUMBER 14. NOTES 1. Prov.: Hirschl and Adler Galleries, New York. 2. D.

William Trost Richards (1833-1905) Woodland Brook , 1861 Oil on canvas, 92.7 x 127 cm. (З6У2 x 50 in.) Beatrice W. Rogers Fund (75. 60)1 William Trost Richards had begun his early art training by the age of 17, in Philadelphia, under the German-born Paul Weber (1823-1916). Weber emphasized the exacting draftsmanship currently popular at the Düsseldorf Academy, where Richards studied briefly in 1856.2 Born in an era when good art meant absolute fidelity to nature, Richards assimilated with ease the most detailed styles he observed in both his American and Ger- man masters. Working as a commercial artist for a manufacturer of lighting fixtures from 1850 to 1853, his early facility at rendering natural detail was cultivated by the practice he obtained there in drawing stylized ornamental motifs. From 1853 to 1861 Richards followed the tradition of Cole, Church, and other Hudson River school artists, making yearly pilgrimages up the Hudson River to the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains. On these sketching trips the young artist rigorously scrutinized the details of nature, returning to Philadelphia with many pencil studies. Meant for later use in the studio, these sketches focus on details of flora and fauna or record compositional groupings of trees and rocks.3 To his contemporary critics, such as Henry T. Tuckerman, Richards was known as an "American Pre-Raphaelite" for his extreme use of detail. In 1863 he had joined the Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, a society originated by an English disciple of John Ruskin, for the promotion of "truth to nature." Richards also professed ardent admiration for the transcendental ist vision of the English Romantic poet, William Wordsworth, and he similarly wished to represent the Divine presence in all of nature's manifestations.4 Long after Tran- scendentalism had lost its popularity in America, Richards remained steadfast in maintaining its ex- pression in his work, in addition to Ruskin's dic- tates governing the role of the artist. Detroit's newly acquired Woodland Brook records the point in Richards' development when he had begun to emulate the romantic use of brilliant light he found in the work of Frederic E. Church and J. M. W. Turner. His observation of Church's technique, coinciding with his own plein air ex- periments, resulted in a phase during the 1860s when Richards began to explore in his tightly de- tailed style, the interaction of sunlight with the landscape. Though the mood of this early painting NUMBER 15. 96</page><page sequence="29">is calm.and placid, it later became important to the artist to record nature at her most majestic and dynamic moments, as reflected in many of his later seascapes of the 1870s.5 Formerly thought to be a Vermont scene, Detroit's painting probably originates from Richards' wan- derings around the Philadelphia countryside dur- ing the summer of 1861. 6 A masterful and con- trolled performance, the composition has been limited to the fore and middlegrounds, and the palette restricted to green and brown mixed with white, enabling Richards to concentrate on the playful range of sunlight and shadow effects. Hav- ing integrated his field studies into the relatively shallow space of the setting, a strong picturesque quality characterizes the scene.

Tannahill (70.1 50)1 Winslow Homer executed some of his finest work in the genre idiom during the 1860s and 1870s. The freshness of vision and sensuous appeal of color and stroke that mark the best of these early canvases is evident in The Four-Leaf Clover of 1873, which came to The Detroit Institute of Arts in 1970 as part of the Robert H. Tannahill Bequest. This charming oil adds strength to Detroit's already distinguished collection of works by the artist during his formative years. From his very first essay in the oil medium, Homer concerned himself with human activity, out-of- doors and in sunlight. In a sense, these early paint- ings may be seen as a continuation of the native American genre tradition initiated in the 1830s by light reveal that the artist attempted to simplify the number of compositional elements. Two pen- timenti in the middle ground can be identified as a ^ second cabin at the left center and a stone bridge with semicircular arches, which extended over the couple in the boat at the center right.7 This early Richards brings to the Institutes's collec- tion of American landscape a fine example of a Hudson River school painter who is presently gaining greater recognition. In a unique manner, Richards combined Church's tradition of meticu- lous draftsmanship and romantic interpretation with the luminist concern for radiant light.

But under Homer's hand, simple narration was trans- formed into a direct presentation of contemporary life in America. There are interesting similarities between his early style and that of Eastman Johnson (1824-1906) in the latter's informal pic- tures; however, the major nonacademic influence in America during the 1860s was that of the French Barbizon school. While there was no di- rect contact between Homer and the painters from Fontainebleau, his viewpoint was closer to the more naturalistic artists of that group, such as Théodore Rousseau and Constant Troyon, than to the American academic establishment of the time. His tonal and color range was much like that of the French painters, and he shared their dedica- tion to rural life and their more immediate response to nature.2 97</page><page sequence="30">In his devotion to the contemporary scene and his concentration on outdoor light and color, Homer's work also parallels the early paintings of the young French artists who would later become known as the Impressionists. He studied The Prin- ciples of Harmony and Contrast of Colours , and Their Applications to the Arts , London, 1859, M.-E. Chevreul's celebrated book on color har- mony, and throughout his career he paid careful attention to the exact effect of not only light, but weather and the time of day. A comparison of his Croquet Scene of 1866 (The Art Institute of Chicago) with Claude Monet's Women in the Garden (Musée du Jeu de Paume, Paris) of the same year reveals stylistic similarities such as the simplified massing of lights and shadows without the use of halftones. Again, these parallels were not the result of any direct influence, since Homer did not visit Paris until the following year. This fact has led several scholars to isolate Homer, along with William Sidney Mount, Asher B. Durand, and Fitz Hugh Lane as the formu lators of an indige- nous impressionism. In certain ways Homer's work differs greatly from true Impressionism, in which the emphasis was on light and atmosphere, often resulting in a demate- rial ization of the object. Homer's chief concern remained the object itself. He never gave color as dominant a role as did the Impressionists; his shadows were never as cool, his distances as blue, nor did his palette include such colors as violet, mauve, or blue-green. The structure of his paint- ings was based on values, in a full range from white to black, and he never used the Impres- sionist technique of broken color. He was an in- dependent who used elements of Impressionist practice as a means to an end. For 17 years Homer earned his living as a free- lance illustrator, chiefly for Harper's Weekly, while training himself as a painter. Since his illustrations were not restricted to the printed text, he was free to choose his subjects wherever he wished, and the summer of 1873 found him on Ten Pound Is- land in Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts. Here he produced a large number of marine paintings and a series of watercolors and oils devoted to children. Unlike other American artists of his gen- eration, his attitude toward this subject was free of sentimentality. Boys engaged in the delights of rural activity play a leading role in these canvases, but girls are also in evidence. They are shown in more passive roles, picking flowers, reposing in hammocks, reading novels, or simply sitting in re- verie as, for example, this little girl who idly studies a four-leaf clover she holds in her hand. NUMBER 16. 98</page><page sequence="31">At first glance, Homer's handling of light effects in this outdoor scene suggests the proto- Impressionistic work of Claude Monet. Eliminat- ing detail, he indulged a taste, uncharacteristic in this early period, for tactile pigment loosely applied. But by this time Monet had begun to flat- ten the picture space and to dissolve form into patterns of pure light and color. Homer retained the three-dimensional quality of the figure, here placed in the right foreground on a receding and slightly diagonal line which leads the eye back to the partially open cellar window and the deep, NOTES 1.

Homer Dodge Martin (1836-1897) In the Adirondacks , 1881 Oil on canvas, 30.8 x 48.6 cm. (12 Va x 191/e in.) Gift of Raymond C. Smith (67.253)1 As an American follower of thé Barbizon school, Homer Dodge Martin broke away from the domi- nation of the Hudson River school esthetics at an early point in his career. Using bright colors and moderate tonalities to express man's oneness with nature, Martin slowly evolved a distinguished per- sonal vision of landscape. The absolute quiet and melancholy of his scenes led John Richard Dennett, his friend and contemporary, to remark that his pictures "look as if no one but God and himself had ever seen the places/'2 Though senti- ment pervaded his scenes, Martin despised the high Victorian taste for literary painting.3 Rather than designing his compositions to tell a story, he preferred instead to use the painterly medium in a more evocative and poetic manner. Abandoning the tradition of descriptive realism, his work ap- proached the Aesthetic Movement viewpoint late in his career through emphasis on technique and color.4 Born in 1836 in Albany, New York, Martin began painting within the local art colony under the ad- vice and tutelage of Erastus Dow Palmer, the noted sculptor, and James McDougal Hart, landscape painter. During his early career Martin spent much time sketching the Adirondacks, emulating the panoramic vistas of the Hudson River school, adopting the detailed manner of Thomas Cole and the crystalline, tranquil mood of John Kensett.5 Even at this point, however, Martin's working method was opposite to that of his fellow Hudson dark space within. Attention has been called to a deliberate, even calculated, interest in classic or- ganization in Homer's work of the early 1870s&gt;3 The tendency is revealed here in the shallow space bounded by the horizontal plane of the wall and closed on either side by vertical lines of foliage. The vines create deep shadows on the greyed mortar; the child's body is modeled and there is a sense of light and dark areas throughout. There is no attempt here at characterization; for Homer, form simply stops light and occupies space. (N.R.) 2.

Taking note of the land- scape arrangement, Martin sketched the coun- tryside exactly as he found it, leaving the details to be added in the studio from memory. Most of his contemporaries, on the other hand, copied botan- ical details directly from nature and left the work- ing of the composition to studio invention. With a reputation already established as a land- scape painter of the traditional school, Martin changed his viewpoint considerably during a trip to Europe in 1876. He came under the influence of the French Barbizon painter, J.-B.-C. Corot, and sketched at St. Cloud, a favorite working retreat for Corot, and at Barbizon. In London he befriended James McNeill Whistler, champion of the Aesthe- tic Movement during the late 19th century and author of a distinctive Tonal ist style. Upon his re- turn to the United States, Martin's work became visibly transformed in the late 1870s. Detail was exchanged for tonality, though not at the sacrifice of color, and the broad panoramas were narrowed to more intimate vignettes of forest and brook.6 A second European trip in the fall of 1881 brought Martin more firmly into the "progressive" camp. From the time of his sojourn in Villerville, a small village in Normandy, painterly technique and ef- fects preoccupied him more. Martin's compo- sitions became increasingly simplified and poetic, tonality obscured color, and the impasto became more forceful. The culminating result of this late direction is seen in Adirondack Scenery, c. 1895 (Edward S. Litchfield Collection), where the com- position has been simplified and observed detail eliminated for strong, flowing bands of autumn 99</page><page sequence="32">color. Although Martin was nearly blind by this time, the ambiance of the time and place had been preserved in his memory.7 The small Martin landscape, In the Adirondacks, 1881, given to the Institute by Raymond C. Smith in 1970, presents an example of the painter's style immediately preceding the late and bold Villerville period. The application of pigment is still thin and even, while autumnal colors suffuse the atmosphere in a warm glow. The viewpoint, looking out over a great forested valley from a high position, is uncharacteristic of Martin during his middle period, the more usual composition being an intimate glimpse into a forest. His pre- dilection for balanced masses, however, deter- mined the arrangement of tree and rock forma- tions in the middleground, and closing the scene NOTES 1. Prov.: Raymond C. Smith. 2.

Though it is only suggested in the Detroit landscape, Martin often achieved a spaciousness through juxtaposing wide, horizontal bands of earth and sky against the tall arabesques of trees. Throughout his career Martin learned from the older masters of the elegiac mood.8 By nature a classicist, in his early years he revered Kensett, and later during his European travels discovered Corot more completely and Claude Lorrain. Mar- tin's special mood of melancholy is aptly evoked in Detroit's painting.

Thomas Moran (1837-1926) The Fisherman's Wedding Party, , Venice , 1892 Oil on canvas, 70 x 83.8 cm. (24 x 33 in.) Bequest of Alfred J. Fisher (67.1 18)1 English by birth, Thomas Moran emigrated with his family to Philadelphia in 1844 at the age of seven. Though Moran was self-taught, he received generous advice from the imaginative Philadel- phia seascapist, James Hamilton, who was called by his contemporaries "the American Turner." Early in his career, Moran indicated his future artis- tic direction. By preference he sought out the many current forms of Romanticism, whether bor- rowed from the symbolism of Thomas Cole or extracted from popular literary themes.2 While he was thoroughly familiar with Turner's engravings, a trip to London in 1861 afforded the young artist the opportunity to study closely the master's oil and watercolor techniques. Turner's painterly fan- tasies of color and light in the British Museum educated Moran well in the means of expressing nature's drama. His knowledge of composition, however, was learned by observing the classical landscapes of Claude Lorrain during a later jour- ney to the Continent in 1866. During the last quarter of the 19th century, Moran contributed a heightened and expressive sense of color to American landscape painting.3 As the^first artist to celebrate the geological wonders of the American West, he established a national reputa- tion with his enormous landscapes. The first of his series depicting the Western parks and canyons was Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , which in- tentionally rivaled the panoramic vistas of Albert Bierstadt's Rocky Mountains and Frederic E. Church's revelatory views of the New England wilderness.4 Purchased by Congress for $10,000 in 1872, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone popu- larized and spurred the passage of the National Parks Bill. Throughout the 1870s Moran accom- panied many expeditions through the Far West and upon returning to the East, quickly capitalized on the spectacular scenery he had seen and sketched - the geological marvels of Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon. Moran matured, however, at the exact moment when the tran- scendental beliefs of the Hudson River school and the pre-Civil War idealism ripened and expired. Striving to become the peer of Church and Bierstadt, he maintained the same philosophy of nature well into the 20th century, which marked him as a conservative laboring under an obsolete esthetic5. After 1900, Moran assimilated the vari- NUMBER 18. 101</page><page sequence="34">ous influences of Théodore Rousseau, George In- ness, and Paul Cézanne, becoming something of an eclectic. Moran's vision of the Western landscape, while geologically accurate, was formed by his romantic temperament and his fascination with atmos- pheric color and light. His delight in Venice was founded on the same experience of the sublime in nature which characterized his response to the American West. He reveled in the dazzling light he found in sailing about the lagoons, and his 1890 sojourn in Italy led to a great flow of Vene- tian scenes patterned after Turner's paintings.6 Under the influence of Turner from his earliest years, Moran's obsession with the luminous and prismatic aspect of nature achieved full fruition in his Venetian oils, of which Detroit's The Fisher- man's Wedding Party, Venice is a first-rate exam- ple. A few pictures of the Venetian series were exhibited nearly every year at the National Academy of Design until the artist's last showing there in 1922. At a time when Americans turned to cosmopolitan Europe for cultural direction, the steady production of the Venetian scenes finan- cially sustained Moran well into the 20th century, NOTES 1.

Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Harold O. Love (72.249)1 Born in Cork, Ireland, Thomas Hovenden received his early art education in the Government Art School of his native city. After his arrival in America in 1863 he studied at the National Academy of Design, and in 1874 left the United 102 States for further study with Alexandre Cabanel at while his American landscapes were slow to sell.7 Impressionism was then realizing a late popularity in the United States, and to many, Moran's Vene- tian paintings were interesting in their chromatic brilliance. His name became linked with Venice in the popular mind when the Brown and Bigelow Company manufactured 22 million color calen- dars after a Moran Venetian sunset of 1898.® A gift to The Detroit Institute of Arts in 1967 from the Estate of Alfred J. Fisher, The Fisherman's Wedding Party , Venice of 1892 is highly represen- tative of the Venetian series. The picture presents Moran's standard view of the Grand Canal, look- ing from San Giorgio toward Santa Maria della Salute and the Dogana.9 With pure colors glazed over a white ground, Moran achieved a variety of luminous and atmospheric effects peculiar to the time of day observed.10 Though the wedding party, which gives the work its title, is well detailed, the narrative element seems incidental to the painting. The artist's real interest was in the painterly ex- pression of wind, air, sky, and water, for it was his own response to nature that was his constant theme.11 (K.P.) and ethereal beauty, extending it to Moran's current "pilgrimage" to the West in 1910.

His first impor- tant painting, The Two Lilies , was exhibited at the Salon that year. From Paris Hovenden went to Brittany, where he and Robert Wylie founded a small colony of American artists at Pont-Aven. Of the many pic- tures he produced there, it was In Hoc Signo Vinces , a scene set in La Vendée in 1793, at the time of the French Revolution, that brought him</page><page sequence="35">his initial public success. In Hoc Signo Vinces ("In this sign shalt thou conquer") representan inter- ior in Brittany, where early in the Revolution, the peasantry stood steadfast for their King. The cen- tral figures in the painting are a Breton peasant and his wife, who is shown fastening to his breast the "Sacred Heart," which was worn by the Royalists as a symbol of their faith. In 1816 Louis XVIII had commissioned various French artists to do a series of portraits of Vendéan generals for the Château de Saint-Cloud.2 These paintings, which reflect the Royalist point of view early in the Revolution, later went to the Louvre. Hovenden was apparently familiar with the por- traits and was intrigued by the dramatic potential of the subject, for he dealt with the same theme many times during his six-year stay in Brittany, focusing, however, on the emotional conflict in- herent in civil strife rather than the heroics of battle. Later, after his return to America, he dealt with the American Civil War in similar terms. Hovenden first exhibited In Hoc Signo Vinces in the Salon of 1880. The subject was not a popular one in France owing to the anti-clerical feeling of the time; nevertheless, French art critics were unanimous in their praise, judging it "the finest figure-piece in the exhibition" and Hovenden's treatment of the subject "a serious and noble per- formance/'3 He thus entered the front rank of the younger painters, and his reputation preceded him back to America. When he next exhibited the painting, at the National Academy of Design in 1882, public response was overwhelming. Detroit's recent gift, In Hoc Signo Vinces , is con- siderably smaller than the canvas shown in Paris and New York (present whereabouts unknown); however, it dates from 1880 and is seemingly iden- tical in all other respects to the larger version. The artist, therefore, apparently painted the subject twice, making the smaller copy for his own future use.4 Of the many articles printed in various American newspapers describing Hovenden's accomplish- ment, the following excerpt from "Our Young Artists," New York World , March 3, 1881, offers not only the Victorian interpretation of the subject, but a fascinating, if fanciful, insight into art criti- cism in America in the late 19th century: It [In Hoc Signo Vinces] represents a young Vendéan wife sewing on her husband's undergarment a badge of the Sacred Heart. The wooden door at the side is closed, but light streams in from the open door probably and falls full NUMBER 19. 103</page><page sequence="36">upon these two figures in the centre. The table is covered with clothes, pis- tols and the like, and we see a great bowl of milk in rough fäience, and a loaf of coarse bread which his mother is cramming into a haversack. A com- rade with his gun lying [sic] against his knee is seated in the left-hand corner looking on gravely. In the background is a corridor jammed with armed peas- ants streaming out into the orchard, of which there is a revelation in a little patch of tender luminous green. A boy, very young and handsome but very grave, is seated close to the corridor leaning against the wall. By his side is his weapon, a scythe mounted on a pole. An old man is peeping through the slit of the wooden window on the left, and the light falls full upon his stern, weather-beaten face. The face of the peasant in the centre is a marvel of fine painting and strong characteriza- tion. He feels very strong emotion at the thought of leaving his wife and his mother and his young child, who is helping to squeeze the big loaf into the haversack. He is too manly to weep, and too manly to wish to hide his emo- tion, and therefore his face is tearless, but full of unshed tears. The seated comrade caressing his gun, which is destined to shoot so many of the "blues," is a marvel of powerful charac- terization. His big round hat hides all his face save his nose and chin. He is in complete repose, and yet in some sub- tle and mysterious fashion the observer knows that he is a marvel of sternness, a man of steel, a Catholic-Puritan, in NOTES 1.

Parisian art critics referred to the painting with the French title (see Archives of American Art, Hovenden file). By 1881, when it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York, the painting was titled In Hoc Signo Vmces (La Vendée , 1793).

In a 13-page paper read before the Plymouth Meeting Historical short, as incapable of pity and of mercy for the foes of the Church and King as the men who hung Quakers and tortured witches at Salem were of pity and of mercy for the "ungodly and malignants." The critic goes on to praise the "excellent drawing and coloring" of the canvas and Hovenden's "su- perb technique," and urges the public not to miss this remarkable painting by an American "who is really able to walk in the highest walk of art." Thus Hovenden introduced into American art the life- sized Salon figure painting. Hovenden's pictures fired the popular imagination as have few other American paintings, for he depicted, without undue sentimentality, the everyday life of the solid middle class. Large re- productions of In Hoc Signo Vmces, and his later works, The Last Moments of John Brown (The Met- ropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and the sen- sation of the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893), Breaking Home Ties (Philadel- phia Muesum of Art), hung in many an American parlor for years. Crowds swarmed to view each new canvas, and the praises heaped upon the artist were lavish.5 Throughout his lifetime Hovenden maintained a consistent level of serious production. In addition, he was an admired and respected teacher at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Robert Henri was one of his students. In Hoc Signo Vinces is the first painting by this important 19th-century artist to be acquired by the Institute. A 1972 gift of Mr. and Mrs. Harold O. Love, it was accompanied into the collections by seven prepa- ratory drawings and a photogravure reproduction published by Goupil and Company in 1880. (N.R.) 5.

Society, February 22, 1955, entitled: "The Life and Works of Thomas Hovenden, N.A.," Helen Corson Livezey stated that Thomas Hovenden "never named pictures til they were quite finished . . . often they bore several titles." She added that In Hoc Signo Vinces was painted in Brittany, exhibited in the Paris Salon ahd then shipped to America for exhibition at the National Academy of Design in 1881. It measured "4x6 feet" and "the furniture used in the painting was purchased by Mr. Hovenden from families who had kept the bed and chest as heirlooms since the Revolution. This painting . . . and another ... are both in private collections in Canada." (See Archives of American Art, P52, frames 560-572.) Edgar P. Richarson noted that in 1884, in order to exploit the rights of reproduction, Hovenden made a two-thirds size replica of The Last Moments of John Brown before delivering the larger version to the man who had commissioned it.

Theodore Robinson (1852-1896) Scene at С /Věrny ; 1890 Oil on canvas, 40 x 65 cm. (16 x 25 3A in.) Gift of Mrs. Christian H. Hecker (70.680)1 In 1970 the Institute was the fortunate recipient of a rare and fine example of Theodore Robinson's high Impressionist style. Scene at Givemy, a gift of Mrs. Christian Hecker, represents an end product of Robinson's long investigation of light. Sold at the Robinson estate sale of 1898, the picture was originally in the collection of the Detroit indus- trialist, Colonel Frank J. Hecker, who with his business partner and important collector, Charles Lang Freer, cultivated an interest in the American Tonal ist and Impressionist painters. It was Freer who in 1908 gave the museum The Pool (08.7), an important oil by John Twachtman, another leader of the American Impressionist movement. Fit- tingly, the Hecker and Freer gifts constitute two of the finest American Impressionist paintings in the collection. Born in Vermont in 1852, Robinson was raised in Wisconsin and spent his early years of study in New York. There he came to know and admire the indigenous Impressionism of Winslow Homer (see no. 16) which decisively influenced the young ar- tist's direction. Robinson's early painting followed a course similar to that of Homer and Eastman Johnson, both of whom developed a style o í plein air painting focused around the effects of sunlight on the landscape. In 1876-1879 and 1884-1892 Robinson lived in France developing his art. For a brief period in 1877 he sought out the Paris academies, as did most American art students of the era, studying draughtsmanship with Jean-Léon Gérôme and technique under Emile-Auguste Carolus-Duran and Jean-Joseph Benjamin- Constant. After meeting Whistler in Venice in 1878 and spending the summer of 1884 at Barbizon, his painting took on a darker, more Tonalist appear- ance in the late 1870s and early 1880s. Exposure to the moody and lyrical landscapes of the French and American Barbizon painters tempered the realist approach of Robinson's art and encouraged his subjective tendencies. In 1887 the young artist visited Giverny, the small village in Normandy where Claude Monet lived. Robinson, though shy and retiring in tempera- ment, struck up a friendship with the master of French Impressionism. The two men never painted together; however, their evening conver- sations eventually persuaded Robinson to experi- ment with the Impressionist technique, which by this time had clearly lost its revolutionary flavor on the Continent. Robinson and other American Impressionists re- jected the French practice of applying pigment to NUMBER 20. 105</page><page sequence="38">achieve an effect of optical scintillation. It has been noted several times that this reticence on the part of the Americans was characteristic and due to the nature of their cultural heritage.2 Robinson greatly admired the strength of Monet's colors. "The Monets are overwhelming/' he remarked, "and - as often - give me the blues - envious blues/'3 But as he was by birth and disposition a New Englander and fragile in health, he had no wish to bring his painting to the same point of visual intensity. From 1888 Robinson pressed further into the opti- cal effects of sunlight upon the landscape. For two years, 1888 and 1889, the artist explored the rela- tion of sunlight to color and form within an ex- tremely subdued palette. Such paintings as Val d'Arconville of 1888 (The Art Institute of Chicago) and Bird's Eye View: Giverny, France of 1889 (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) show his early, muted Impressionism at its best. The year 1890 initiated Robinson's high Impressionist phase, immediately characterized by a brighter palette. Within a year the surfaces of his canvases NOTES 1.

Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) Flight into Egypt , 1899 Oil on canvas, 50.2 x 64.8 cm. (1 9% x 25 У2 in.) The African Art Gallery Committee Fund (69.452)1 The scene of many foreign art colonies and esthe- tic revolutions, turn-of-the-century Paris attracted a legion of American art students who had flocked to the ateliers and academies for training. Within this dynamic milieu Henry Ossawa Tanner, a black American expatriate, found a respected place, enjoying the camaraderie and patronage of wealthy Americans in the Parisian community. Known primarily as a painter of religious subjects, Tanner forged a unique artistic direction as an in- dependent among the many European modern art movements. Flight into Egypt adds to the Detroit collection a fine example from Tanner's tran- 106 sitional phase, when he moved from a detailed to became vivid through the increased use of broken color. Scene at Giverny demonstrates Robinson's change to more vibrant tonalities. A mauve band of shadow and a contrasting yellow band of sunlight compose the lower half of the painting, while the color changes and brushwork become exuberant through the middleground, describing a landscape of architectonic forms. The energetic strokes run diagonally and seem to radiate around the hay- stack, which is placed slightly off-center. Applied in dry, thin washes, the paint has been built up into patches and horizontal bands of color, em- phasizing the surface plane and demonstrating the two-dimensional nature of painting. As John Baur has observed, Robinson's signifi- cance lies with his position as one of the first to wed French Impressionism to American art.4 Illus- trating a crucial step in the development of his Impressionist style, the Detroit painting gives us Robinson's art in a most joyous mood and at its best moment. (K.P.) on this point, meaning primarily the strong national landscape tradition, the Hudson River school, and the great impact of John Ruskin's treatises on American esthetics and criticism. 3. Baur (note 2): 27. 4. Ibid.: 51. Peter Birmingham, American Art in the Barbizon Mood, exh. cat., National Collection of Fine Arts, Washington, D.C., 1975: 89, added another aspect to the discussion of American artists' conservative approach to Impressionism, commenting on the "residue of Barbizon feeling" in Robinson and Twachtman. a freer, more painterly mode. In 1969 the Frederick Douglass Institute of Negro Arts and History (now the Frederick Douglass Institute and the Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C.) circulated a traveling retrospective of his work, from which the Detroit painting was purchased. The exhibition helped to re-establish the high reputation which the artist had enjoyed during his lifetime. The son of a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Tanner grew up in Philadel- phia. Since boyhood he had been determined to become a painter; thus, his parents' efforts to es- tablish the young man as a flour merchant proved fruitless. For two years at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1880-1882, Thomas Eakins was his master. Eakins' teachings, em- phasizing a scientific approach to nature, greatly</page><page sequence="39">influenced Tanner's early realistic style. For six years thereafter the young artist practiced independently, selling illustrations to New York publishers and working as a professional photographer in order to save enough money for European study. In the winter of 1891 he sailed for Paris, never to return permanently to the United States. His early years in the French capital were spent under the tutelage of Jean-Joseph Benjamin- Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens at the Académie Julian, where Tanner's ability won immediate recognition. His paintings were soon regularly ac- cepted at the Salon. The French government hon- ored Tanner by twice purchasing his work and by awarding him the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1923. As a newcomer to Paris, Tanner joined the Ameri- can Art Club. There he established friendships with other American artists and patrons which were to support him for the rest of his life. The success of his paintings, Daniel in the Lions' Den (now Los Angeles County Museum) and Raising of Lazarus (bought by the French government for the Luxembourg Galleries), at the Salon inspired Rodman Wanamaker, a wealthy businessman liv- ing in Paris, to sponsor him on a trip to the Holy Land in 1897 and again in 1898. The second trip of 1898-1899, which inspired Detroit's Flight into Egypt , was meant more specifically to give Tanner the occasion to sketch the entrance of the German Emperor into Palestine.2 Unexpectedly, the en- trance took place in an unstately, chaotic manner, not allowing sufficient time for the artist to make studies. Tanner made up for the failed opportunity, however, by closely observing the exotic character of the landscape. Rather than noting the particular details of Middle Eastern or "Oriental" culture in the tradition of many 19th-century French paint- ers, Tanner was most interested in the general am- biance. He later recalled the productivity of his experience there in the following manner: We spent six months painting around Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, and this gave me an insight into the country and 107 NUMBER 21.</page><page sequence="40">the character of the people that my shorter previous visit had only whetted my appetite for. "A Flight into Egypt" [sic] and several smaller canvases were the result of this trip. Never shall I forget the magnifi- cence of two Persian Jews whom I once saw at Rachel's Tomb; what a magnifi- cent Abraham either one of them would have made. Nor do I forget a ride one stormy Christmas night to Bethlehem. Dark clouds swept the moonlit skies and it took little imagina- tion to close one's eyes to the flight of time and see in those hurrying travelers the crowds that hurried Bethlehem- ward on the memorable night of the Nativity, or to transpose the scene and see in each hurrying group a "Flight into Egypt."3 Tanner's use of Biblical subjects is characterized by a broader viewpoint as well. In a conscious attempt to universalize the narrative, he explained that his religious figures portray the turmoil of the human condition against the enduring stillness and radiance of nature: "My effort has been to not only put the Biblical incident in the original setting - which is a small matter - but at the same time to give the human touch 'which makes the whole world kin' and which ever remains the same."4 NOTES 1.

Abandoning the American Realist tradition cultivated in him by Eakins, Tanner adopted at this time a more paint- erly, esthetic attitude, typified by Whistler. In the lower third of the Detroit canvas a white under- painting is evident. Over this has been laid a series of thin washes which push the opaque pigment toward transparency. During the years preceding World War I, Tanner developed the tendency to- ward transparency into a unique glazing tech- nique. Controlled by the silver-blue hues of moonlight, the chromatic relationships of the De- troit painting have been carefully harmonized. The strong undercurrent of emotional tension re- sults from the chromatic artistry as it is expressed in the moonlight landscape, rather than from the narrative dimension of the scene.5 Largely through his series of paintings, Mothers of the Bible , reproduced in Ladies' Home journal during the fall of 1900, Tanner knew a short-lived fame. In addition to his better-known religious paintings, however, his work, like that of his friend Myron Barlow, included many landscapes and genre scenes depicting the Etaples peasants. When Tanner experienced financial difficulties during the Depression, the artist's wealthy patrons faithfully supported him, and though forgotten during the post-World War II period, Tanner is be- coming recognized today as one of the finest pain- ters to emerge from the American art colony in Paris.

Mathews (note 2): 135-136, pointed out that perceptive re- viewers of the time noted Tanner's relative lack of interest in the Biblical story and his appreciation instead of "the mysterious qualities of nature." However, a few reviewers missed the emo- tional intensity altogether, seeing only that it was absent from the narrative: "What have these marvellous color harmonies to do with religion? Their subjects are borrowed from the Bible as others are from history or legend, but that is all. There is in them no religious inspiration whatsoever . . ." (ibid.: 146). 108</page></plain_text>
