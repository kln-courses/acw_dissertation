<plain_text><page sequence="1">Seals and Sealing Practices in Hatti-Land: Remarks ? propos the Seal Impressions from the Westbau in Hattusa Theo van den Hout The Oriental Institute During the 1990-91 excavation seasons in the Upper City of the Hittite capital Bogazk?y/ tJattusa more than 3400 sealed bullae and clay lumps were found in a structure called the Westbau. Not only the very size of the find but also the fact that there were 1364 seal impressions of princes and officials among them promised a wealth of information about the Hittite governmental system and bureaucracy. The publication of this particular group of seals was soon entrusted to Suzanne Herbordt, who was already known for her work on Neo-Assyrian seals and sealing practices.1 Heinrich Otten took on the task of editing the royal seals. Not long after, however, Prof. Otten retired and the publication of the latter part was also given to Herbordt, assisted by Daliah Bawanypeck.2 Herbordt made the sealings of princes and officials the topic of her Habilitation at the University of Leipzig, which was accepted in 2000 and subsequently appeared as the book under review. As is usual in the Bogazk?y/Qattusa series, the book is beautifully and flawlessly executed. Following a brief introduction (chapter I), chapter II (pp. 7-23) offers a detailed descrip tion and analysis of the archaeological situation of the Westbau and its inventory. Here the reader will find all the evidence for the distribution of the inscriptional material and thus the original systematic storage of the sealings and charters in the building. A large fold-out map in the back of the book provides the exact location of every single find in the building. The bullae and sealed clay lumps were found accompanied by land deeds or charters, usually known as Landschenkungsurkunden. This combination was already known from a similar but substantially smaller (some 200 pieces) complex that came to light in 1931 in and around Room 1 in the west corner of Building D on the acropolis B?y?kkale. Thanks to modern and more sophisticated excavation techniques, we now know that the bullae of the Westbau were kept on a higher floor level and were filed in groups. The combination of royal and non-royal seals makes it possible, moreover, to link officials to kings and thus to establish a largely chronological system of record keeping. This in turn enables us to deter mine a stylistic development that is for the first time chronologically secured. Here (pp. 19, 22) as elsewhere in the book, Herbordt follows Peter Neve's dating of the Westbau and most of the Upper City of Hattusa to the second half of the thirteenth century and in particular to the reign of Tudbaliya IV (c. 1240-1210 b.c.)

Large parts of the Upper City now must be dated back to the sixteenth and fifteenth century,4 and the Westbau too might well be considerably older than the last half century of the Hittite empire. The assumption of a transfer of the pre-Tudhaliya material to the Westbau from elsewhere (pp. 22f., 39) would thus no longer be necessary. A comparison with similar find complexes in Bogazk?y (Bldg. D, storage rooms surrounding Temple 1, and various temples in the Upper City) and elsewhere in Hittite Anatolia (Ku?akh, Tarsus, Korucutepe, and Kaman Kaleh?y?k) leads Herbordt (pp. 22f.) to define the Westbau tentatively as an administrative stmcture, a depot for storing valuable items and records, perhaps the kind of building that is known from the Hittite sources as an ? NA4KISIB, lit. "house of the seal/of sealing." Such institutions were found all over the Hittite empire collecting the taxes of their districts. This leads naturally into the interesting chapter III (pp. 25-39) on sealing practices in Hittite society. The clay lumps had been used to seal objects of various kinds. In most cases they were formed around cords that must have been suspended from materials to be sealed. In other cases the back of the clay lump shows the impression of leather bags and there is one instance of a textile imprint (p. 34 n. 273). Herbordt (p. 25) quotes H. G. G?terbock5 as saying that the Hittite word *siyatar is not attested in the meaning of "(original) seal" (Siegelstock), but in fact it is: A few years after Guterbock's article had appeared, in KUB 33 (1943) Otten published several fragments of the "Song of Ullikummi" that G?terbock was to edit less than a decade later. In this story the god Ea visits Upelluri, the Atlas-like figure to whose shoulder the stone monster Ullikummi is attached and Upelluri tells him about the saw with which long ago they had separated Heaven and Earth. Thereupon Ea orders the Primeval Gods to fetch the saw from the an cestral storehouse, saying, EGlR-pa^at besten annalla attalla h?hadalla "E1 NA4KISIB.HI.A nu kar?iliyas addas NA4KISIB udandu [n*a]t apiz EGlR-pa siyandu "Open them, the old fore-fatherly (and) grandfatherly storehouses and let them bring the seal of the ancestors [and] with that let them seal [th]em again."6 Although not mentioned by the author, we may also know the Hittite word for "bulla," parzaki-, which was tentatively identified by Silvin Kosak in his book on inventory texts as "label, bulla."7 The literally thousands of seal impressions that we now have stand in stark contrast to the few sealed tablets that are attested. As Herbordt observes (pp. 28, 36-39, 111), this situation compares unfavorably to that prevailing at Ugarit and Emar, where many records sealed with the seal of Hittite kings, queens, and high officials were preserved. Of course, in the Hittite tablet collections one might at best expect unsealed drafts and/or copies of the official and sealed records that were sent off. As for the almost complete absence of sealed docu ments (apart from the charters) that were once deposited in the temples, this problem was identified early on by Heinrich Otten: We do not seem to have Hittite "state archives," that is, the collection of sealed, verified, and legally authentic originals written when they were first issued and?as the cuneiform records seem to indicate?deposited in temples. When Otten made this observation in 1959,8 there was still hope that such records might be found but it now seems more realistic to assume that most were taken by the ruling class when they 4.

According to the author, the reason for the discrepancy between Hattusa on the one hand and Ugarit and Emar on the other lies in the fact that we do not have any private documents from Bogazk?y, that is, official records of the business of state representatives with private individuals.10 The sole "Privaturkunde in hethitischer Sprache" mentioned in this context (p. 26) is in fact a clay tablet and to invoke the wooden writing boards (ibid.) to fill the sup posed gap of sealed private records is a somewhat uncomfortable solution, even though the author mentions two passages that attest to the use of wooden tablets for such documents.n The question, of course, remains as to what objects all these bullae and sealed clay lumps belonged, if they were not attached to private records. For the clay lumps (Tonverschl?sse) that were used to seal leather bags and other containers the answer is relatively obvious. In these cases they secured goods, the quality or quantity of which was guaranteed by the sealing authority. In the case of the bullae, Herbordt quotes G?terbock,12 who followed Kurt Bittel13 in suggesting that the bullae might have been attached to objects and records like charters. In that same context G?terbock mentioned that according to the cuneiform texts wooden writing boards could be sealed as well. Herbordt then continues with a brief description of such writing boards based on the one found in the Ulu Burun shipwreck and she points to the large number of styli that came to light in Bogazk?y.14 These are needle-like objects with one pointed and one flattened end. The fact that they are unsuitable for writing cuneiform but could be used for drawing the often rounded hieroglyphic signs (and for erasing them with the flattened end) fits the often encountered opinion that wooden writing boards were used for that particular script. The situation seems to be far more complex, however. Massimiliano Marazzi has in my opinion convincingly shown that there is no reason to assume that wooden writing boards were written with the hieroglyphic instead of the cuneiform script.15 It is even decidedly unlikely, because it would go against the thus far firmly established one-to-one relation of the script: In Hittite society the hieroglyphic script was used for the Luwian language ex clusively while cuneiform was much more flexible. One also wonders what the reason could have been for switching scripts, especially given the fact that hieroglyphic script is so much less versatile and more cumbersome than its cuneiform counterpart. 9. Cf. van den Hout, SMEA AI (2005): 286f. 10. Thus already Bittel, JKF 1 (1950-1951): 170. Note that many of the records from Ugarit and Emar with royal seals or those of Hittite court officials are not private records either. They, too, are official statements issued by representatives of the Hittite state and found in state tablet collections; cf. G?terbock, MemYoung, 53f. 11. Although Marazzi, FsBelardi, 142-53, has expressed some reservations concerning the question whether the Sumerographic combination GlS.rjUR automatically implies a wooden tablet, it seems best to assume that it does unless there is explicit evidence to the contrary. 12. SBo 2: 4. 13. MDOG 73 (1935): 25; see also later JKF 1 (1950-1951): 167-72. 14. Although wooden writing boards and scribes-on-wood are well attested, and the Ulu Burun exemplar is always mentioned in this context, it is sobering to remind ourselves that apart from its unknown provenance it is also extremely small: R. Payton, AnSt 41 (1991): 100 n. 13, gives the measurements as 9.5 x 6 cm. but these are the maximum measurements; the inscribable surface seems to be no larger than c. 7 x 5 cm. judging by the photos on Plate XVII, barely large enough to have contained about ten to twelve lines of cuneiform with room for just a few words per line. Assuming the use of hieroglyphs, there would have been even less available space. It was certainly large enough to contain a seal impression. 15. FsBelardi, 131-60, esp. 136f. and 160; cf. also in Administrative Documents in the Aegean and their Near Eastern Counterparts, ed. M. Perna (Turin, 2000), 79-102.</page><page sequence="4">342 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127.3 (2007) If the bullae had once been attached to wooden writing boards, one also wonders whether all the wood of those documents would not have left behind some trace in the archaeological record. If each writing board had a single bulla hung from it as shown in Herbordt's illus tration Abb. 18c, we are entitled to expect roughly as many boards as bullae, that is, some 3000. If they had attached to them five or so bullae as pictured in Abb. 18a, we should still have over 600 of them. The suggestion that the bullae might have been attached specifically to Landschenkungs urkunden or legal documents that needed sealing as validation also raises some unanswered questions. Why did the administration switch from clay to wood in the case of documents that they intended to keep indefinitely and apparently had an important legal status?16 Surely, wax was much more prone to being tampered with than dried, let alone baked, clay. Also, it seems that wooden tablets were used in general for more ephemeral purposes and not for long-term documents.17 Finally, given the chronological complementarity of the charters and the bullae and the fact that among the bullae we now have ample examples of royal seals, why was the custom of sealing these writing boards in the middle of the "obverse" or what responded to that side of a clay tablet in its wooden version discontinued? Seen in this light, the recent suggestion by Clelia Mora that the bullae had sealed the preliminary regis tration of incoming goods on wooden tablets makes more sense, although their having been kept for some 150 years (especially in view of the fact that these preliminary records would have been transferred to clay tablets in a second phase) and the combination in one find complex with the Landschenkungsurkunden remain difficult to explain.18 As Herbordt recalls (p. 32 with n. 262), both Bittel and G?terbock initially?and in correctly?assumed that the bullae of Bldg. D had all been deliberately burnt by the Hittite administration. Even if that view can no longer be upheld, their suggestion that the bullae had been separated from that to which they had once been attached in order to be kept as evidence of a particular transaction is worth discussing. It seems clear that bullae and other sealed clay lumps were kept in distinct places, sometimes, but not always, in the proximity of charters.19 It is thus also conceivable, for instance, that they were evidence of equally distinct administrative actions, of which it was important to know who had been responsible for them how many times. At some point, there may, but not necessarily,20 have existed complementary textual records that were discarded over time. Any future administrator would have known what the bullae stood for and the keeping of the bullae alone would have secured the basic information needed. In this context it may be important to recall?see also below?that extremely few of the sealing officials are actually attested as practicing scribes. There seems to have been a whole body of officials who oversaw all kinds of administrative actions but were not the professional scribes responsible for the writing of the clay tablets that we are familiar with and who may rarely or never have engaged in actual writing. A more archival (in the sense 16. See already Riemschneider, MIO 6 (1958): 329. 17. Cf. Cl. Mora, FsKosak, 544f. 18. FsKosak, 545-48. Mora tries to counter this objection by noting that the oldest stratum of sealings includ ing those datable to the early thirteenth century make up only 5% of the material. As stated further below, I am not sure that this is relevant; it might simply reflect the smaller volume of business in those earlier days. 19. The storage rooms 27-34 north of Temple I as well as Temple 12 in the Upper City had bullae but no charters. 20.

Thanks to the archaeologically based chrono logical distribution of the material, Herbordt is able for the first time to sketch the devel opment of designs not dependent on artistic criteria alone. We can see the oldest seals from around 1500 B.c. with their broad borders filled with all kinds of figures evolve into those with smaller borders whose decorations become less and less figurative and more repetitive. Over the same period some seals also become larger and more elaborate, especially those of kings and their highest officials as opposed to those of the rank and file of state officials. Hardly surprising is the high number of round stamp seals characteristic of Anatolia, but that almost one quarter of all sealings stem from seal rings was unexpected. The particular long, almost oval, form of the rings may have developed in northern Syria as a hybrid of the more typical round Anatolian seal ring type with the Syro-Mesopotamian cylinder seal. Unattested in the oldest group of Westbau seals, it can have been introduced at the earliest in the reign of Mursili II or even the early thirteenth century. It is interesting that the rings allow bigraphic inscriptions, that is, in both cuneiform and hieroglyphic script, which for stamp seals seems a royal prerogative. Impressions from cylinder seals are also attested in the material, albeit only sparely with just 42 pieces (3.1%). They are, however, striking as a direct borrowing from Assyria and probably all stem from the reign of Tudshaliya IV (c. 1240-c. 1210 b.c.).22 As mentioned above, the preservation of the material in groups allows the author to sketch a stylistic development ranging from c. 1500 to the thirteenth century b.c., based both on the general "look" as well as on individual motifs and symbols or signs. The iconographie repertoire of the seal corpus is rather limited, and the interpretation of many anthropomorphic figures visible in the impressions that are not obviously identifiable as gods remains prob lematic. Apart from a few explicitly recognizable deities, there are two main figures: an archer or person shouldering a bow and a person with a long robe. These can occur either by themselves, doubled in antithetical arrangement, or in combination with one or more deities. The latter are easily recognizable either by their attributes, including the pointed headdress with horns or by the "caption" giving their name. In the case of two deities, the archer and man-in-the-robe can co-occur (cf. p. 64 Abb. 42d). The question concerning both figures is whom they represent. Are they to be interpreted as "portraits" of the seal owners or of gods, perhaps tutelary deities of those same seal owners? As an argument in favor of the figure representing the mortal seal owner, Herbordt mentions the fact that they are closely associated with their name, sometimes "carrying" the hieroglyphs or their name's main element, just as the deity sharing the seal space often does with his own name. That they are deities would be supported by the fact that they sometimes 21. Interesting in this context is the recent preliminary publication (AAS 15 [2006]: 151-62) by Daisuke Yoshida of more than six hundred sealed bullae found in the so-called Rundbau 1 at Kaman-Kaleh?y?k. They are dated to the late fifteenth and early fourteenth century b.c. and were apparently dumped into this round structure when it had already collapsed and lost its function (see S. Omura, AAS 9 [2000]: 13, and 10 [2001]: 16). The bullae were found mixed with ashes, suggesting they might have come from another burnt structure the remains of which served as fill. The final publication of all the material has to be awaited to see how long a period the corpus covers, but we have a very substantial group of sealed bullae here that seems to have been discarded, possibly after a fire had made them useless, that is, illegible for the most part. 22. For a cylinder seal of Tudfcaliya IV, see the very interesting article by Herbordt in The Iconography of Cylinder Seals, ed. P. Taylor (London, 2006), 82-91, 153f. (notes), 207-11 (plates).</page><page sequence="6">344 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127.3 (2007) carry the triangle (BONUS) or the ankh-like sign (VITA). They can also be depicted standing on animals or the VITA sign. Herbordt mentions proponents of both views but does not take sides in the debate. If the figure were a deity, one would have to conclude that when combined with another god, only one deity would have been identified while the tutelary deity of the owner would always remain anonymous. Significant also is that in practically all cases23 the archer and the man-in-the-robe wear a round, tight-fitting cap, not the pointed helmet with or without horns so characteristic of Hittite gods. Concerning the BONUS and VITA signs they hold or on which they stand, these signs are ubiquitous and invoke well-being and longevity for the seal owner. There is nothing to suggest that these symbols are a divine prerogative, and if these two figures are gods we seemingly have in Hittite iconography hardly any representations of non-royal mortals. The fact that in some Hittite texts representations of gods are described as "holding (a) 'well being' (sign)" does not necessarily make it an exclusively divine symbol, and we do not have similar descriptions of statues of mortals. An element distinctly favoring a non-divine interpretation of the figure is the fact that sometimes he is seen pouring a libation before a deity (pp. 67f.). One should also mention the Umarmung s s zene: Until now, such depictions of deities embracing a person were only known for living kings, but in the Ni?antepe corpus there are two examples on seals of officials (pp. 69-71). With the living, mortal king as a parallel, one might suppose the same status for the embraced archer. Finally, it may be interesting to note that on the two seals of women featuring figures (nos. 267, 270), all personages seem to be female. These arguments seem to me to speak for a human rather than divine interpre tation of the archer and the man-in-the-robe. If so, it is an interesting question what these two stereotypes represent. Were they ideal figures?the heroic warrior or hunter versus the more official-looking robed individual? Apparently, if one ordered a seal, there were only these two options. To what extent both options were open to everybody is not yet quite clear, but Herbordt makes some very inter esting observations (pp. 72f., 109f.) about the chronology of the two: The archer occurs only after Mursili II, while the man-in-the-robe is already attested in the older group from the reign of Suppiluliuma I. She also discusses their distribution among persons bearing various titles. The two types seem to be modeled after the general iconography of deities that was also used for kings. The man-in-the-robe matches the traditional portrayal of the Sungod, while the archer is fashioned after the soldier-like Stormgod and other male deities. The Hittite king could be depicted either way, probably depending on what image he wanted to promote at any given time or what the occasion called for: either the ruler as representative of the Sungod on earth as reflected in the title with which he was to be addressed by his subjects (dUTU-SI, "My Sungod") or the ruler as the more martial Stormgod. As opposed to the officials, however, the king as Stormgod always wears the pointed helmet, mostly with a few horns, albeit never with as many as the "real" god. The iconography thus expresses a hierarchy that reflects the status of kings according to traditional Hittite royal ideology. First come the gods, then the king as their representative on earth, and then his subjects. Along with this, one might posit a kind of continuum ranging from divine to non-divine in which the king is not a real god (he never has as many horns 23. For an archer with a pointed helmet (without horns), see p. 61 Abb. 41a.</page><page sequence="7">van den Hout: Seals and Sealing Practices in Hatti-Land 345 as the Stormgod) during his lifetime but is as close to the gods as a mortal can come.24 Royal propaganda certainly sought to have him perceived by the population as such. This closeness is expressed by his being dressed in every way like the god, simply with fewer horns, and being addressed as "My Sungod." This continuum may even extend to the king's second-in-command, the tuhkanti, in the two new and surprising variants of the Umarmungsszene with Urhitessub, Muwatalli's son. As Herbordt convincingly argues (p. 71), the motive for this depiction was in all likelihood political, although even more than Urhitessub himself, it may have been his father Muwatalli II who was responsible for this choice in an attempt to secure the succession for his son. Either way, the political prop aganda may show an early awareness that the legal succession of Muwatalli by his son might not go uncontested. Finally, this corpus confirms and further enriches our knowledge of the administrative system and its officials. Again, it is clear to what extent the running of the state was a family affair. The number of princes?and occasionally princesses?is high. The best represented group, however, is that of the scribes, a qualification that evidently could be combined with many other titles. Especially interesting is the apparent hierarchy of "scribe," "scribe two," "scribe three," and "scribe four," which has no obvious equivalent in the cuneiform sources. Although Herbordt says that "die Rangfolge der Bezeichnungen zwei/drei/vier oder um gekehrt" (p. 100) cannot be determined with certainty, the relative frequency of these titles pleads in favor of "scribe four" as the highest level: Only the individual with the name VITA+RA/I carries this title, while there are nine "scribes three" and thirteen "scribes two."25 Of great importance are also various new identifications of hieroglyphic and cunei form titles. Chapter V offers a prosopography of individual seal owners whose names are also known from the cuneiform sources. The fact that chronological groups can be separated out allows us to recognize an older group of officials that worked under the Hittite Great King Suppi luliuma and his immediate successors around the middle and in the second half of the four teenth century b.c. To some extent this fills an important gap between officials from the earlier fourteenth century as known from the Ma?at H?y?k correspondence and those active in the much better attested thirteenth century. Herbordt offers more detailed prosopographical analyses of nineteen individuals of the late empire period (mostly from the second half of the thirteenth century) who had been studied previously and for whom relatively rich material was already present in the Hittite texts. The new glyptic material confirms the high status of some, and especially important is Herbordt's observation that certain persons known from the cuneiform tablets as influential and powerful officials do not seem to be represented in the corpus at all. Conversely, there are names of many individuals who had up until now been completely unknown from the cunei form sources. She mentions the woman Muwatti with 28 bullae, Sariya with 32, Tuwarsa with 37, and Armanani with 48. If the hieroglyphic name JANUS-VIR.Z//A is correctly read as Izzummizidi, then he may be added to this list as well: Izzumizidi is the most frequently attested official of the entire Westbau corpus, with 55 impressions. Herbordt suggests two explanations for this disconnect (pp. 88f.): First of all, the bullae represent an administrative sphere that is only scantily represented in the texts. Second, 24. This seems to have changed with the reign of Tudhaliya IV, who requested divine honors for his person while alive; see van den Hout, BiOr 52 (1995): 545-73; Herbordt in The Iconography of Cylinder Seals, 87f. 25. The same is true when one looks at the number of impressions made by these scribes as shown in Table 12 on p. 99: 129 with "scribe two," 40 with "scribe three," and 5 with the single "scribe four."</page><page sequence="8">346 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127.3 (2007) especially for the older period only a selection of the sealings would have been preserved. As to the first idea, it is true that the administrative corpus from Bogazk?y is not large, but it is worth recalling Mora's observation that there is a significant overlap between individuals mentioned in these texts and some sealing officials, and especially her suggestion that the frequent formula PN ?DI, lit. "so-and-so knows/has acknowledged," might refer to that person as the sealing official in charge.26 Concerning the second suggestion offered by Herbordt, there is nothing to support the assumption of a deliberate selection of the sealings, and if we assume an attrition of the material over time this should be approximately equal to that of the sealings from the thir teenth century. Therefore the proportions of the older sealings to the later ones should still be similar. Instead, the substantially smaller number of officials and their impressions from the second half of the fourteenth (Suppiluliuma I and Mursili II) and early thirteenth centuries probably reflects an administration that operated on a still relatively modest scale, but which experienced rapid expansion a little less than a century later. Not only had the volume of business grown exponentially by then, but so had the ad ministrative apparatus. Izzummizidi, one of only twelve officials attested from the days of Suppiluliuma I and Mursili II, was able to take care of most administrative acts on his own and is therefore the official with most impressions overall. The number of officials sealing in the second half of the thirteenth century was many times larger, but the workload (and authority) was more evenly divided. It is also interesting to see that in terms of number of sealings, the top 10 officials (in descending order: Izzummizidi, Armanani, Tuwarsa, Tarkasnatali, Sariya, Muwatti, Sauskamuwa, VITA+RA/I, Pihawalwi, Sauskaruntiya) are either not attested at all in the cuneiform sources (Izzumizidi, Tuwarsa, Tarkasnatali, WITA+RA/I, Pihawalwi), or but rarely and in contexts that do not directly substantiate an identification (Armanani, Sariya, Muwatti, Sauskaruntiya). There were apparently high officials who worked only in this branch of administration and consequently left no trace in the cuneiform record. The largely administrative character of the situation in which the bullae and Tonver schl?sse functioned is supported by the titles and professions that are the topic of chapter VI. The pie chart on p. 92 shows in a single view that scribes and similar civil servants (47.3%) and their overseers or superiors (22.2%) form the clear majority of professional groups whose sealings have been recovered. Especially frequent among them is the use of the "title" SCRIBA. Herbordt correctly keeps open the possibility that this is not so much a title as a basic claim of literacy.27 This seems all the more likely since only four out of the roughly 120 names of "scribes" are actually attested as such in the tablets from Bogazk?y.28 It may well be that the host of scribes responsible for the tablets that we have were relatively anonymous craftsmen, whereas the seal owners who style themselves as SCRIBA mostly belonged to the literate upper class of Hittite society.29 26. Mora, FsKosak, 540. For the corpus, see J. Siegelov?, Verw. Of the sixteen persons mentioned in the formula PN ?DI, six with the same names are also attested in the Westbau corpus (Eblisarruma, Piljamuwa, Takisarruma, Tarhuntapiya, Walwazidi, and Zuzzu). 27.

This, of course, is the pi?ce de resistance of the book and it deserves all our admiration and gratitude for the incredible amount of work that went into it and the flaw less presentation. In the last part of this chapter (pp. 248-313), David Hawkins offers (in English) invaluable "Commentaries on the Readings" of the hieroglyphic legends. Especially the 18 excurses on individual signs or combinations, spellings, and semantic observations contain much that is new. This is followed by a brief commentary on all designations for titles and professions contained in the corpus. In the following I will offer just a few minor observations on the catalog: Nos. 53-57: For an individual mdS?N-pihami in the Hittite cuneiform sources, see KUB 57.31: 4 and VSNF 12.133: 6. No. 246: The personal communication referred to by Herbordt concerned my tentative association of ku-mi with the Luwian adjectives kumma- and kummay(a)-, "pure, sacred, holy," and its derivatives (cf. F. Starke, StBoT31, 363 w. n. 1298; H. C. Melchert, CLL, 108f.; and see now also Hawkins here, p. 299/excursus 17). This stem lies at the base of the Lycian kumaza- "priest," which according to Hawkins, CHLI I, 474, may be attested in the first millennium HLuw. KAYSER? inscription as well. For other forms of this stem in HLuw., see Hawkins, CHLI I, 98, 139, 343, 357. No. 426: For the possible identification by Elisabeth Rieken of Tarkasnatalana in hiero glyphs on the reverse of the cuneiform tablet KBo 13.62, see forthcoming Giulia Torri, ICH 6. No. 522: For another instance of a scribe Zi/a-?-li, see A. M. and B. Din?ol, Gslmparati, 208f. Excursus 6 (p. 292): Hawkins discusses here the possible phonetic value HATA of the ligature LINGUA+CLAVUS (tongue + nail) as proposed by B. Din?ol, ICH 3, 169-71, a suggestion triggered by his own description (StBoT Bh. 3, 72) of the combination as a pierced tongue. Whereas Din?ol gives the meaning of the Hittite verb hat(ta)-, hazziya- as "(ab)stechen, schlagen," Jaan Puhvel, HED H, 248, is more accurate with "to make a hole (in), pierce, prick, stab, slash, perforate," among others. For pierced body parts compare several times, KIR14 hattanza/haddanza, "with a pierced nose" (KUB 29.7 obv. 1, 38, 48; KBo 53.93: 11; KBo 16.97 rev. 12), sometimes used in describing a woman who is also parkuis, "pure." The latter adjective makes it unlikely that the nose in these cases would have been broken off or slit, even if it had only been the nose of a mask (thus R. Lebrun, Samuha, 133; M. Schuol, AoF 21 [1994]: 116). Some kind of deliberate body piercing seems more likely. For piercing or sticking with a needle or nail (seppikusta-), compare the passage where a "physician" (LUA.ZU) pierces himself and others with two needles/nails (KUB 41.15: 9-13 + KUB 53.15 i! 19-23; cf. G. Beckman, BiOr 42 [1985]: 143; St. de Martino, Eothen 2, 80). Finally, for a possible word play on Hattusa and the verb hat(ta)-, lhatsie-l, one can quote the Anitta text, where Anitta curses anyone wanting to resettle the city: kuis ammel ?ppan LUGAL-us klsarTP nu VRl]Hattusan appa as?s[i] n*an nepisas dlM-as hazzie[ttu], "Whoever will become king after me and resettle[s] gattusa, may the Stormgod hazzie- him!"30 Since the verb hat(ta)-, hazzie- is not usually seen in curse formulae, its use speaks in favor of a deliberate choice of this word in this specific context. 30. KBo 3.22 rev. 49-51 (OS), ed. E. Neu, StBoT 18, 12f.</page><page sequence="10">348 Journal of the American Oriental Society 127.3 (2007) The book concludes with extremely useful lists and concordances (chapter IX), a sign list with a commentary by David Hawkins, and sixty plates with photos and drawings. All in all, the riches both of the material in this book and its exemplary presentation pro vide endless possibilities and necessary reading for all those interested in Hittite art, culture, society, and history for which both Suzanne Herbordt and David Hawkins deserve our deepest gratitude.</page></plain_text>
