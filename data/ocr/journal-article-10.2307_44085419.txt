<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN P. TASSONI Deep Response An Ecofeminist, Dialogical Approach to Introductory Literature Classrooms i I want my literature students to be ecofeminists. Ecofeminism offers a better approach to life than the anthropomorphic, androcentric conceptions of nature that dominate Western culture. Because it of- fers such a better life for our planet, I want students to become active forces in the construction and maintenance of the heterarchical, holis- tic societies that ecofeminists promote. However, I am against teachers who impose their values on stu- dents. Such impositions reinforce the very sort of monologic, hierar- chical relationships that ecofeminists resist. Teachers who force their views on their classes subordinate the interests and concerns of stu- dents to their own. Furthermore, such teachers promote passivity in their students, who are encouraged to parrot their instructors' ideas rather than critically examine their own ideas and those of others. My goal is to be counterhegemonic, not totalitarian. I want to per- suade my students to scrutinize their inherited values and those of ecofeminists, and I want them to voluntarily embrace ecofeminism as more conducive to healthy human and nonhuman relations. Although the subversion of oppressive Western tenets does rep- resent a principal aim of ecofeminists (see Warren, 6-8), ecofemi- nists need to remain open to conflicting viewpoints: they cannot perpetuate the very monologic conceptions of truth and hierarchy</page><page sequence="2">132 ISLE they seek to resist. By closing themselves off from alternative view- points - even androcentric, anthropomorphic ones - ecofeminists would close themselves off from the kinds of self-critical introspec- tion they need to respond locally - in persuasive, rather than coer- cive ways - on behalf of feminist and environmental concerns. In other words, by remaining open to opposing viewpoints, ecofemi- nists can continually examine and reexamine their own goals; at the same time, they can participate in productive debates with those who might oppose and those who might not understand their aims. In my literature classrooms, I promote ecofeminism as an ongoing dialogue, one taking place in and among its own advocates as well as with those people whose ideas may not affirm its principles. My teaching, then, employs what Patricia Bizzell would call "a pedagogy of persuasion." Reflecting the dialogic methods of educa- tors like Bizzell and others, such as Ira Shor, Henry Giroux, and Paulo Freire, the classrooms in which I promote ecofeminist values are not sites of monologue: the students who object to, who are baffled by, and who are suspicious of ecofeminist ideas are taken se- riously, and the students who accept these ideas continue to develop and revise their thinking in dialogues with me and with other class members. "In this pedagogy," Bizzell writes, "[teachers are] autho- rized to attempt to persuade students to try on [what the teachers conceive of as democratic] values,1 while at the same time the stu- dents also exercise persuasion, on [the teacher] and their peers, where they see changes being needed in the cultural awareness" (198). I introduce ecofeminism to my literature classes because I have been authorized by my university to promote critical thinking and active citizenship. I have a responsibility to expand my students' ar- eas of concern and sense of heterarchy as much as I possibly can, and no approach to life and literature offers a vision as expansive and as egalitarian as that of ecofeminism. In this essay, I describe methods of dialogic pedagogy that can be used in the teaching of ecofeminist theory. I narrate as well some of my own experiences teaching ecofeminism in an introductory literature course at Indiana University of Pennsylvania in spring 1992. 1 describe this particular class for three reasons. First, the dia- logues about ecofeminism I had with students in this course dem- onstrate the extent to which an ecofeminist, dialogical approach to literary study can help teachers and students engage issues of both lo- cal and global importance. Second, my experiences with this class -</page><page sequence="3">Deep Response 133 not altogether successful - suggest further ways of dialogizing the classroom so that students might be persuaded to "try on" ecofemi- nist principles. And third, while it perhaps represents the greatest hope for a counterhegemonic, dialogic, ecofeminist pedagogy, the introductory, nonmajor literature course has been a neglected area of scholarship. Overall, I argue that an ecofeminist, dialogical approach to intro- ductory literature classrooms can help students engage critically with and consider alternatives to those aspects of our society that undermine egalitarian relations not only between humans - alterna- tives for which Bizzell's pedagogy aims - but also between humans and nonhumans, and among the various other forms of life on the planet. 2 In my introductory college literature classes, issues of gender tend to be among the first that students broach in a course I hope will help them read and write discourses vital to their needs as critical citizens. Together, my attention to gender issues, which strongly em- phasizes ecofeminist concerns, and the dialogical pedagogies of ed- ucators like Giroux, Shor, Bizzell, and Freire have given me hope for the cultural work that can be done in and through introductory lit- erature classrooms. After all, most of the students who take these classes will not enroll in advanced literature courses; it is in the introductory course that ecofeminist teachers have a chance to reach a representative sample of the student population, those stu- dents who will go on to become chemists, accountants, mathemati- cians, and dropouts, and those who may, as they advance /decline academically and socially, have little chance for the sustained con- sideration of cultural issues that literature courses offer them (see Cahalan and Downing, 8). So, as Patrick D. Murphy does in his essay "Coyote Midwife in the Classroom: Introducing Literature with Feminist Dialogics," I will admit up front that my "introduc- tory literature course is not really 'abou≈• literature." My introduc- tory course, rather, uses literature "as a study example" (163), as a point of departure from which class members might critically ex- amine the attitudes and beliefs that influence them and the world around them.</page><page sequence="4">134 ISLE This is an important distinction to make, because in many respects formalist, New Critical doctrines still dominate introductory courses in literature. These doctrines treat texts as self-contained artifacts and promote little, if any, critical consideration of the material con- ditions surrounding the interpretations, compositions, and recep- tions of literature. At least two factors contribute to the persistence of such doctrines: one, many teachers perceive the course as a place in which students are to study the "basics" of literature, such as set- ting, plot, and character; and two, many teachers believe contempo- rary critical theories, such as poststructuralism and ecofeminism, represent complexities beyond the grasp of freshman and sopho- more students. However, a recent publication in the area of pedagogy and critical theory, James M. Cahalan and David B. Downing's Practicing Theory in Introductory College Literature Courses (1991), raises significant questions about the "basics" of literary study. Essays in this collec- tion identify the ideological dimensions of New Criticism and under- mine claims its advocates might make for its primacy as a literary tool. Formalist and New Critical approaches to literature, various writers in this collection show, have no more claim to the foundation of literary study than, say, cultural approaches such as Marxism and feminism. In addition, writers in Practicing Theory make convincing arguments for introductory courses that are responsive to the social and political issues foregrounded in critical theory. Rather than fixate on textual analyses to the exclusion of sociohistorical factors sur- rounding compositions, receptions, and interpretations of literary works, the introductory literature classrooms that writers describe in Cahalan and Downing's collection help students examine the vari- ous discourses of gender, race, and class that affect them socially, historically, politically, and academically. Despite collections like Practicing Theory , which describes how contemporary theories can and have reshaped the introductory course, the implications of an ecofeminist approach to the introduc- tory classroom have yet to be examined. It is, however, important that this gap in pedagogy scholarship be filled, because an eco- feminist - particularly, an ecofeminist, dialogical - approach to lit- erature and life can help teachers and students engage cultural concerns that a formalist vocabulary, as well as the vocabulary of many contemporary critical theories (see Love, 202), might other- wise ignore.</page><page sequence="5">Deep Response 135 3 I stress the dialogical intentions of my class because the need for social change indicated by ecofeminists cannot be adequately ad- dressed within the traditional framework of the literature class- room. What I am referring to as traditional here are those practices related to what Paulo Freire describes as the banking method of education ( Pedagogy , 58), an approach to which the New Criticism has been highly adaptable (Cahalan and Downing, 6). In its extreme form, banking-method teaching treats students as empty receptacles obligated to receive the information their instructors deposit into their minds. These deposits are intended to accrue interest, serving as cultural capital that in the short run helps students earn A's for the course and in the long run heralds students' solvency in main- stream culture. Such a pedagogy allows little, if any, room for stu- dents' critical reflection on the material. Rather, teachers represent knowledge as a set of uncontested truths and compel students to re- cite (in the classroom, on exams, in research papers) the "true mean- ing" of texts, those interpretations (usually foregrounding formalis- tic, New Critical elements) determined by the teacher and previous scholars. Perhaps the major drawback of the banking method is that it effaces students' own cultural experiences, thus limiting the discourses to which the academy must become accountable and limiting, as well, the opportunities for change such discourses might suggest. In this manner, the banking method works against the democratic promise of open admissions policies: not only does it impede the develop- ment of a democratic citizenry by encouraging the uncritical accep- tance of information, it reinforces the academy's own deafness to at- titudes and beliefs that might challenge the status quo. Dialogic pedagogies, however, challenge the banking approach to knowledge. With the dialogic approach, students and teachers func- tion as learners, working collaboratively to create and critique course materials. Such a pedagogy reverses the passivity that the banking model encourages in students and inspires them to assume active roles in the reading and writing of their culture. Through the dia- logic method, literature classrooms can be transformed into demo- cratic public spheres (see Giroux, 309-10), spheres in which stu- dents and teachers explore the possibilities of egalitarian human and nonhuman relations and practice the rhetorical strategies neces-</page><page sequence="6">136 ISLE sary to communicate their needs and the needs of "Others" within a diverse ecosphere. Although many literature teachers do encourage discussion in their classrooms, these discussions are often mere preliminaries to the teachers' disclosure of "correct" interpretations. In other words, although many literature courses today little resemble the extreme version of the banking approach Freire describes, elements of the banking method still intercede to curtail dialogue, and as a result, students frequently approach classroom discussions as a form of guessing game wherein they continually guess at "true meanings" until the teacher decides that someone has hit upon them. These in- terpretations may comprise the unexamined values and assumptions of the dominant gender, race, and class, in which case their function is to maintain the status quo. As C. A. Bowers writes, "In effect, the taken for granted nature of . . . patterns will lead to repeating them, until we either choose to examine them or are forced to confront them because of ecological damage that can no longer be ignored" (126). To put it another way, literature classrooms such as this pro- mote the uncritical acceptance of inherited knowledge over the ac- tive decoding and encoding of the metaphorical structures that shape human and nonhuman interactions. In the same vein, interpretations issued in traditional classrooms may - depending on the instructor - support radical ideas such as those of ecofeminism. However, if students consider these ideas to be but deposits for them to withdraw and spend on demand, they may reinforce the very thoughts and attitudes their teachers seek to resist. Students in traditionally structured classrooms may, to nego- tiate the demands of their ecofeminist instructors, merely reproduce "correct" answers and, in some cases, even conceal their objections to the answers their instructors advocate, without ever understand- ing or even considering the social implications of the answers they write down in blue books or say aloud in class. In such cases, some of the students' (and teachers') more underlying assumptions of cul- ture may go unaddressed - may continue to support the hierarchi- cal conceptions of human and nonhuman relations that constitute life in Western culture. On the other hand, students in such classrooms may actually learn to value the radical insights offered by ecofeminists, but class mem- bers come to such appreciations within a conceptual framework (the banking method) in which the principles of the powerful (the teacher,</page><page sequence="7">Deep Response 137 the academy, etc.) are imposed upon them. They replace one set of truths (patriarchy) with another (ecofeminism), leaving the new truths as resistant to change and as intolerant of difference as the former (see Schilb, 263). The danger of having students come to such an understanding of ecofeminist ideas is that they come to it with- out having to develop the rhetorical capacities to interact with oth- ers as speaking subjects. Students who come to ecofeminism in this manner develop the values but not necessarily the skills they need as critical citizens in a democratic society: they may be able to artic- ulate alternatives to oppressive Western values, but they may be- come as equally oppressive themselves in presenting their ideas to others. As an alternative to the banking model, the dialogical approach to literature encourages students to see "Others" as speaking subjects, not merely the objects of their attention (Murphy, "Coyote/' 164). In the dialogical classroom, knowledge is represented not as static but as determined interindividually between people within a given cul- ture or situation. Dialogic teachers do not merely inform students that knowledge is determined interindividually; they employ class- room practices that reinforce this conception of knowledge and do so in a manner that helps students understand that their determina- tions of what is valuable and true may have actual effects in the world beyond examination grades. 4 Previous scholarship, such as Murphy's "Coyote Midwife," de- scribes dialogic practices in more detail than I have room for here, so in this section I will only touch upon some of their principles and reserve space for a detailed discussion of my students' written re- sponses to our sessions on ecofeminism. In this section I briefly de- scribe how teachers can dialogize knowledge in literature classrooms by engaging students in the development of curricula and in the cri- teria for grading. One thing I always do, for instance, is talk with my students about how I have graded certain assignments in the past and ask them, given their particular experiences with the assign- ments, to suggest things I might emphasize in my assessment of their work. In the spirit of democratizing their classrooms, other teachers ask students to grade one another's work and even go so far as to</page><page sequence="8">138 ISLE have students grade their own work. Whatever the case, the object of the dialogical teacher is to have the criteria brought up for discus- sion, rather than have it imposed upon students as a demarcator of self-evident truths. When students have a say in how they are to be graded, they can begin to see the means by which "truths" can be negotiated and begin to see how the results of these negotiations af- fect how and what they learn (see Murphy, 166). Such an understanding opens the teacher's comments on stu- dents' writing, on texts, on society, to dialogical response, thereby empowering students to develop and practice their own capacities for judgment. These capacities are further exercised when students take part in the construction of curricula, from determining the di- rection of class discussion to selecting the very texts that they will read. I allow my students to choose at least a novel they would like to read for the course. Generally, they choose a work I have not read and usually one that has had little, if any, scholarly attention, such as Stephen King's Misery. Not only does their involvement in this pro- cedure, like their involvement in establishing criteria for grades, set the stage for discussions about the politics of choice - about what kinds of texts and ideas get included and valuated and what kinds get excluded, devalued, or ignored in a literature class - but it also helps me to demonstrate to my students the limits of my expertise. I need to learn the text with my students and relearn my assumptions about culture according to the interests my students express through their choice and through their interpretations of the reading. As Ira Shor writes in A Pedagogy for Liberation , a book he coauthored with Paulo Freire, If the dialogical teacher announces that he or she relearns the material in the class, then the learning process itself challenges the unchanging position of the teacher. That is, liberatory learn- ing is a social activity which by itself remakes authority. In this case, authority is the form of existing knowledge as well as the governing behavior of the teacher. . . . These challenges demys- tify the teacher's power, open it up to change. They impose hu- mility on the existing order. They invite the students to exercise their own powers of reconstruction. (101) When students select the readings, they can be reasonably sure no neatly packed collection of interpretations accompany these texts, or at least they can be sure to a certain degree (provided that the frame-</page><page sequence="9">Deep Response 139 work of my course is dialogical) that I have no prefabricated set of correct answers that they must struggle to uncover. Rather, students and I work together in our readings of texts to generate meanings in and against the context of other works we have read over the course of the semester. Students do not passively consume "universais" pro- nounced by a single speaker: we argue the cultural significance of texts and our readings of texts, not what students "need to know for the exam." The dialogic classroom opens to debate the various perspectives class members bring to literature. One of the more common ways for teachers to foreground these various views is to have class members write responses to their readings and to share these responses in class - sometimes in small groups, sometimes with the class as a whole. Rather than conduct the class according to a preset agenda, the teacher allows discussion to originate from students' own textu- alizations, and the class together explores the social and cultural im- plications of their various responses. In this manner, ecofeminists have a much better chance than they would in a traditional lecture format of addressing students' interests, of helping them to develop an internal dialogue - a deep response - concerning their role as readers and writers of culture (see Bauer, xi), and of encouraging them to engage and develop not only their own ideas but those of other students (see Murphy, 172-73). The advantage of having class members write down their re- sponses is that it offers students a record by which they can chart the changes (or lack of changes) in their perspectives and continually use their earlier responses as resources for future readings and dis- cussions as they participate in dialogues with me, with other class members, with the readings, and with themselves. I often ask my students to write down their initial responses to texts and then to amend and /or revise their responses after they have read the com- ments of others and after we have discussed the work in class. I also ask students to comment upon any revisions they might have made (or might not have made) in their subsequent response. In this manner, students in an ecofeminist, dialogical classroom can situate their ideas in terms of broader social and environmental dialogues; whether or not their perspectives change, they are encouraged to be- come accountable to others for their beliefs. Such accountability, facilitated through the few methods I describe above, challenges monological, patriarchal, authoritative, "correct"</page><page sequence="10">140 ISLE views of the world.2 In this manner, the aims of the dialogical class- room intersect very much with those of ecofeminists. Like ecofemi- nists, dialogical teachers promote heterarchical relations through a critical understanding of "Others/7 whether those "Others" be fel- low class members, teachers, or members of another gender, race, class, or ethnicity. Donald A. McAndrew, examining workshop writ- ing classrooms, draws similar comparisons between writing peda- gogy and ecofeminism, comparisons that apply very much to the type of literature classrooms that I describe in this section: [In these classrooms] we form communities of readers and writers, reducing the patriarchal dominance of the teacher. We read from a non-hierarchal canon that represents writers of all colors, classes, genders. Students write what is important to them[,] not what is assigned by a dominant teacher; they have ownership and authorship. We don't teach them as much as we nurture and empower. Our classroom has become more like a micro-environment or ... an ecological niche, as we see its diversity and connectivity as a richness and model of living literacy. (7) Additionally, an ecofeminist, dialogical approach to literature en- sures a fuller consideration of social issues, ensures a consideration of the ways our everyday interactions with one another might rein- force, challenge, or change conditions on this planet. 5 When I introduced ecofeminist ideas into what I had considered to be a dialogical classroom, students and I not only confronted topics we had encountered in our previous discussions of gender but also expanded our discourse to encompass topics that may have been otherwise eschewed, topics ranging from those commonly cited by ecofeminists, such as connections between human interpersonal re- lations and current ecological crises, to those of more particular con- cern to me as a teacher of English, such as the connections between my students' attitudes toward the course and the responsibilities of democratic citizenship. I learned many things in that introductory literature class and have adjusted my pedagogy accordingly in sub- sequent courses; but looking back on those few sessions that focused</page><page sequence="11">Deep Response 141 on ecofeminism in spring 1992, 1 can think of nothing I learned more than the range of concerns that ecofeminism addresses and the need to address such concerns within a chain of pedagogical practices committed to a dialogic critique and creation of culture. For the particular week of classes that I narrate here, I assigned my students two short stories. I chose the texts because I felt they complemented each other nicely in regard to ecofeminist concerns. For the Tuesday class, students were to have read and written re- sponses to Antonio Moravia's "The Chase," and for Thursday, they were to have read Angela Carter's "Peter and the Wolf." For this sec- ond period, they were to have written a response to the following set of questions: How are women and nonhuman nature perceived in Angela Carter's "Peter and the Wolf"? How is this perception similar to or different from those exhibited in Moravia's "The Chase"? In either of these works, are there comparisons /contrasts between human and nonhuman nature? Are these comparisons /con- trasts or this lack of comparisons /contrasts beneficial or harm- ful to those involved in the works and to culture in general? If so, in what ways? Although I normally do not issue such directive questions to my classes, I was not afraid of imposing my interpretation of the texts or my narrative of ecofeminism on these students. Even though I was in fact limiting the context within which students could read the texts (in fact triggering a discussion of ecofeminism), I felt comfortable that I had arranged my class, and particularly these sessions on eco- feminism, so that our discussion of the issues could at least proceed from the students' own assumptions about the theory. I also in- formed class members why I was assigning them the questions - to help us get started on a study of ecofeminism, which I briefly defined - and told them that they still had the option to write re- sponses of their own if they felt my questions excluded any insights they might otherwise have on the text. Nonetheless, even before students had encountered my directive questions, their consideration of "The Chase" led us into many ar- eas of concern to ecofeminists. Briefly, Moravia's story is about a distressed husband. Throughout his first-person account, the hus- band laments what he views as his wife's loss of vitality, which he describes as a "wildness." One day he follows her, noticing as his</page><page sequence="12">142 ISLE "chase" proceeds that her wildness seems to be returning. He dis- covers the cause of this to be a male lover, whom she meets and em- braces passionately in the street. The narrator is at first compelled to confront the couple, but soon decides against it, deciding to leave the luster of her wild beauty unscathed. What I initially saw in this story was the explicit association of woman and nonhuman nature, and how the institution of marriage seemed to eschew this woman's needs as an individual. I thought the story might provoke some in- teresting dialogue about gender relations, particularly in marriage, and about human /nonhuman relations, as suggested by the man's "chase." What became immediately apparent in our class discussion on the story was that students held the woman in "The Chase" completely responsible for the failure of the marriage, with the strongest indict- ment coming from the women in the class. In fact, the first woman to speak referred to the man's wife as a "dog" because of her extramari- tal affair. Another woman in the class commented that "she needs to feel guilty; she needs to be put in her place." After asking these stu- dents to elaborate more on their statements, I attempted to defend the woman's actions, pointing out that we were not getting her side of the story and indicating that the husband throughout seems oblivi- ous to what she is thinking. Many students still, however, blamed her because she had not forced herself to be heard. One male student even suggested that since "The Chase" represented the husband's first-person point of view, he would be obviously articulate enough to understand her needs if she would only speak up. I suggested that his understanding of her as something wild might be impeding his sympathy for her needs, making her needs secondary to his own. As the session progressed, I felt that criticism of the woman's actions lessened, but many in the class were still concerned with defending the position of the man, even feeling that he should have attacked his wife's lover. Although I would not exactly characterize our de- bates as ecofeminist, our class's reading of "The Chase" surfaced many of the Western assumptions challenged by ecofeminists: the arational, unreliability of women as creatures of nature; the superi- ority of human, moral laws and social institutions; the valuation of physical conflict. I identified these issues for my students and men- tioned that they were principal concerns of ecofeminism, which we would discuss in more detail in our next session.</page><page sequence="13">Deep Response 143 The second session began with students reading their responses to my questions. Students, therefore, came into class already having grappled with issues important to ecofeminists; to various degrees each member of the class had developed a position on which she/ he could reflect critically and use to challenge ecofeminist ideas as I made my arguments. For this session, students were work- ing with Carter's "Peter and the Wolf." This story is about a young girl raised by wolves and her series of encounters with her male cousin, Peter. The wolf-woman is very much a part of wolf culture; the c√≤usin evolves more and more into "civilized," human culture, even leaving his village at the story's end to pursue a career as a member of the clergy. I like this story for its juxtaposition of wolf life and human culture, particularly its depiction of Peter's inability to understand his cousin's wildness, which is very much tied to her femininity. The class members had a good time with this story and were cer- tainly less antagonistic toward its female character. Among the top- ics they brought up this day were the differences between non- human and human "ideologies" (the girl becomes acculturated to wolf life, just as Peter is to human civilization, and each "culture" holds different values), the ways humans see themselves as superior (characters saw the woman's life among the wolves as unfortunate), and conceptions of female /nonhuman sexuality (Peter is unable to come to terms with his cousin's mysterious sexual organ). I told my students that I was interested in these topics because they had led us into a lot of ecofeminist concerns. Our observations had pointed to the fictionality of human truths, and the d√©mystification of such truths helps us to see where changes might be made in oppressive social constructs. Our reading had also indicated some of the par- ticular and harmful aspects of "human ideology": hierarchical con- ceptions of human/nonhuman relations and the understanding of women as things beyond reason represent perspectives that patriar- chally raised men use to legitimate their domination of woman and the environment. At this time I also passed out photocopies bearing the following principles of ecofeminist thought outlined by Ynestra King in her ar- ticle "Toward an Ecological Feminism and a Feminist Ecology." I briefly discussed these tenets in the context of the discussions our class had had over the past two sessions:</page><page sequence="14">144 ISLE 1. The building of Western industrial civilization in opposition to nature interacts dialectically with and reinforces the subjugation of women because women are believed to be closer to nature in this culture against nature. 2. Life on earth is an interconnected web, not a hierarchy. There is not a natural hierarchy, but a multitiered human hierarchy projected onto nature and then used to justify social domination. . . . 3. A healthy, balanced ecosystem, including human and nonhu- man inhabitants, must maintain diversity. . . . Biological simplifica- tion, i.e., wiping out of whole species, corresponds to reducing hu- man diversity into faceless workers, or to the homogenization of taste and culture through mass consumer markets. . . . [W]e need a decentralized global movement founded on common interests but celebrating diversity and opposing all forms of domination and vio- lence. Potentially, ecofeminism is such a movement. 4. The survival of the species necessitates a renewed understand- ing of our relationship to nature ... ; it necessitates a challenging of the nature-culture dualism and a corresponding radical restruct- uring of human society according to feminist and ecological prin- ciples. (King 119-20) This brief presentation took more the form of a dialogue, with stu- dents interjecting their thoughts throughout, than a formal lecture. I then asked students to amend their written responses with any thoughts they might be having in reaction to our week's discussion. When the session was over, I collected their response statements and headed to my office, where I would research the effects of our week of discussions and continue our dialogue on paper. 6 An ecofeminist, dialogical pedagogy makes environmental aware- ness an integral part of what McAndrew calls a classroom's "living literacy" - a practice that takes this form of dialogics even beyond that performed by Mikhail Bakhtin, whose writings underlie many of the practices discussed here (see Ward, 174-78). Bakhtin writes, "Outside society and, consequently, outside objective socioeconomic conditions, there is no such thing as a human being. Only as a part of a social whole, only in and through a social class, does the human</page><page sequence="15">Deep Response 145 person become historically real and culturally productive" ( Freudian- ism , 15). An ecofeminist, dialogical pedagogy takes this conception of the human and this conception of the historically real and culturally productive a step (in fact, countless steps) further. Where, as Murphy points out, Bakhtin (and, we might add, dialogical pedagogues) "in [their] effort to reinsert the human being into history and culture . . . artificially remove . . . that being from the environment" ("Prole- gomenon," 46), an ecofeminist perspective "breakjs] dialogics out of the anthropocentrism in which Bakhtin performs it" (48). The aim of my ecofeminist approach to my students' written responses was to help them and to help me expand our notions of dialogic relations. As I commented on my students responses, then, I was trying to use my ecofeminist viewpoint to "break" my class's dialogue "out of the anthropocentrism" that pervades Western civilization. Of course, this was no small feat, and I cannot with any certainty say I was successful. But I can say that the ecofeminist perspective offered me a position from which I could consistently call my students' at- tention to interpersonal and environmental concerns. Doing this, I could at least begin the processes of negotiation, i.e., bring my stu- dents to a point where they could "try on" ecofeminist values and weigh them against their inherited ones. Some students responded favorably to my discussion on eco- feminism, and I tried to use my reading of their statements to get them to examine further the implications of the theory. I wanted them to strengthen their stance, especially where those stances re- vealed only surface understandings of ecofeminism (which was to be expected, given the relatively short period of time we had spent on the subject) or attempts to please their teacher (which was also to be expected, given the educational environment to which IUP's mostly working-class, first-generation college students were accus- tomed). For instance, I noticed that students who expressed inter- est in ecofeminism rarely considered the nonhuman emphasis of the theory when they revised their responses. "Well," wrote one stu- dent, "I would kind of like to change my view on 'The Chase.' I see better now that he was not listening to her and didn't care for what she had to say. She was listening to him by doing the physical things he wanted to but he was not listening to her by talking to her." The student displays a sensitivity to the lack of dialogue between Mora- via's characters, a sensitivity to the ways the husband may be at once silencing and reconstructing his wife according to his own ideals.</page><page sequence="16">146 ISLE However, the student fails to attend to other consequences of the husband's ideals: Moravia's speaker sees not only his wife but also nonhuman nature as the prey of man. The character's conception of his wife curtails dialogue within his marriage, and it displays man- kind's monologic approach to "Other" life in general. That the student forsook discussion of the environment in favor of a discussion of gender relations may have been due to the fact that so few readings in our anthology had lent themselves to a discussion of environmental issues. Simply, the student was better prepared to discuss gender than she was the environmental concerns. In this light, her example suggests further the need to bring ecofeminist is- sues into the classroom: an ecofeminist reading can expand the perimeters of our discourse in ways that a focus on gender relations does not. Had I introduced the ecofeminist perspective earlier in our semester, many of the works we encountered in our anthology, whether they attended to images of nonhuman nature or not, might have provoked discussions of environmental concerns, which could have helped students to see the connections between human interre- lationships and the fate of our planet. I felt it was important to ask class members who took stances such as this student's, "Is it im- portant as well that he might think all things wild undeserving of dialogue?" I also noticed that the responses of students who reacted favor- ably to ecofeminist theory often reflected assumptions complicitous with patriarchal domination. A male student, for instance, wrote, "Instead of trying to change nature as the family tried to change the girl [in "Peter and the Wolf"] we should let it take its course and live life like it was supposed to." He also asks, at the conclusion of his amended response: "Just because we don't understand, does that give us the right to change both women and nature to something we do understand?" This student's position reflects a critical awareness of human epistemology, particularly the degrees to which our val- ues shape our reality. In place of our aggressive epistemology, he believes men "should always listen to what [women and nonhuman nature] are saying." Such a position lends itself to a productive dia- logue, but I was concerned that the student had opened his amended response qualifyingly: "I believe the girl in 'Peter and the Wolf' would have had a much better life being human." Although he ac- knowledges the need for dialogue, the student nevertheless assumes a position of superiority: the wolf-woman in Carter's story should</page><page sequence="17">Deep Response 147 follow the (wolf) course in life she has been allotted, but this course bears the marks of inferiority; she "would have had a much better life being human." I felt compelled to ask this student: "What's wrong with the girl's life as it is?" and "What's so great about being hu- man?" It is doubtful that humans can construct and maintain dia- logic relations with nonhuman nature so long as they assume their superiority, their "better" way of life. I worked especially hard at identifying such underlying assump- tions, which ultimately might curtail students' appreciation of eco- feminism. One student, for instance, amended her position state- ment with the words: "Sometimes I feel ecofeminists tend to go overboard." She agreed that "fundamental changes must be made" in society if humans are to manage a healthy relationship with their planet; however, she believed that some of the comments her class- mates made in the name of ecofeminism were "ridiculous." In par- ticular, she saw little sense in comparing the smokestack of a nearby cogeneration plant to the male penis, as had one speaker, and she belittled the attempts of some feminists to change the spelling of words, such as "women" to "womyn." All in all, the student dwelled on these aspects of "extremist" ecofeminism. In neither her initial nor her amended response did she devote analysis to those "funda- mental" social structures she felt were in need of change, and she made no comment on the cultural transformations that ecofeminists propose. In my written response to the student's paper, I commented on her criticisms of feminist and ecofeminist thought: indeed, this woman is not the only person ever to find letter changing and phallus hunt- ing excessive, and I wrote to let her know that I agreed with her to a certain extent, that an overemphasis on these particular points may trivialize some of the more dire concerns of ecofeminists. But at the same time I told her that I thought dialogue about such apparently trivial things could produce, eventually, big changes in society. I wrote her that I was also worried that her own attention to these ele- ments might have distracted her from some vital issues. Reading the student's response statement from an ecofeminist perspective, I be- gan to question her initial assumption, feeling that it might exhibit a complicitous relation with elements in society that reinforce the op- pression of women and nonhuman nature. Particularly, I was concerned that the student's connection be- tween ecofeminists and "overboard" replicated elements of Western,</page><page sequence="18">148 ISLE hierarchical society that associate men with rationality and culture, and women with arationality and nonhuman nature. Over the last couple of millennia, such a social structure has subordinated women and the nonhuman nature with which women have been associated. Meanwhile, the notion that any position can be "overboard" as- sumes that the prevailing social structure must remain intact and suggests that it is the responsibility of individuals to remain "on board." Such an assumption characterizes alternatives to the status quo as crazy, dangerous, or, at least, inconsequential. Given the de- pletion of the rain forest in Brazil and recent attempts to overturn Roe v. Wade, the student's willingness to go down with her ship por- tends consequences of which she might not have been aware. I hoped to engage her in a dialogue that would direct her toward a more critical involvement with her own position: "What is 'over- board'?" "Can 'overboard' be something good?" "Whose interests do we serve by following rules of behavior that keep us on board?" "Where is this ship headed?" I also was sure to ask her why she found the attention to symbolism excessive, but not the idea we need to make "fundamental changes" in our society: "Isn't this a lot more 'excessive' than playing with language?" Again, the purpose of these questions was not to indoctrinate the student, but to initiate an internal dialogue on her part, to vacillate her current position so that she might interrogate some of the more underlying assump- tions on which she had constructed her arguments. In some instances, students' rereadings of their own responses did indeed display interrogations of their own assumptions. An initial response by one student* for example, evidenced an uncritical view of associations between women and nonhuman nature: In "The Chase" the woman was "wild." The girl in "Peter and the Wolf" was also "wild." I believe this is the way these two au- thors perceive women, and the way many of us men perceive women. They are creatures that can't be trusted and just do things (most things) without any thought. This is where I tie in the nature aspect. It is the nature of all women no matter what environment they are in to act "wild." Among this conundrum of patriarchal assumptions is the implicit valuation of masculinist reason over the supposed arationality, even irrationality, of women and nonhuman nature. The student assumes the "natural" superiority of men as the bestowers of meanings and</page><page sequence="19">Deep Response 149 values, as the rulers of creation on guard against all things female and nonhuman, "wild" things that cannot be trusted. Reading this response, I thought of Michael E. Zimmerman's claim that "so long as patriarchally raised men fear and hate women, and so long as men conceive of nature as female, men will continue in their attempts to deny what they consider to be the feminine /natural within them- selves and to control what they regard as the feminine/ natural out- side themselves" (24). Over two millennia old, such assumptions do not often come un- done in one 90-minute literature class. However, the student's reply to his own response suggests the relativization of his position: I was pretty lost in my response to "Peter and the Wolf." After the discussion on ecofeminism I understand more of what you were looking for. I know I am a pig headed conservative type of guy but I just don't see it happening. I'm for equal rights but changing our way of life to cater to the environment is a little crazy. I feel we should recycle and be conscious of our resources but there has to be a point to stop. I really don't know what I mean, I think I'm just lost? After the discussion on ecofeminism, the student's position no longer bears the marks of a universal. Aware of an alternative discourse, the student now identifies himself as "conservative," and he expresses an uncertainty about his opinions. The gratuitous question mark with which he concludes his response seems to highlight a sudden and somewhat inarticulate confusion. Despite the assertiveness of his previous remarks ("I just don't see it happening"; "changing our way of life ... is a little crazy"; "there has to be a point to stop"), the student in the end appears indecisive, nagged by some unmentioned (or unmentionable) principle as he wanders "lost" ("overboard"?) among his own assumptions. The student's indecisiveness could reflect the vacillation of his current position. But his revision also displays the entrenchment of oppressive Western values and the need for expanded discussion of ecofeminist principles in undergraduate classes. Although class- room dialogue destabilizes the student's assumptions, he neverthe- less reaffirms some diehard tenets of patriarchal culture. For one thing, the similar ways that Western culture has oppressed both women and nonhuman nature receive little consideration in the amended response. The student advocates "equal rights," but re-</page><page sequence="20">150 ISLE fuses to compromise his privileged position as human in order to "cater to the environment." In other words, the student perceives humans as distinct from and superior to other life on the planet. As ecofeminists have argued, this perception reinforces the oppression not just of nonhuman nature but also of women, who "are believed to be closer to nature in this culture against nature" (King, 119). In my attempts to persuade him to "try on" ecofeminist principles, I pointed these things out to him, and asked him, "Who decides at what point to stop?" and "Why is 'catering to the environment' crazy?" The idea, once again, is to use the response statements to produce more dialogue, so that students can use their writing to ex- plore further the implications of their reasoning. The responses also helped me to understand the ways the class- room itself shaped my students' responses. Sticking with the above example, I found disturbing the student's acknowledgment that he composed his response while conscious of "what [I was] looking for." Considering this statement, I was forced to read the student's vacillating position in an additional light. It was not so much, I fig- ured, that his conservatism was under threat but that he was strug- gling with ways to affirm his conservative beliefs without offending me. I had worked hard at dialogizing my classroom, but elements of my course still disrupted a free exchange of ideas. 7 Remarks such as this student's have convinced me just how neces- sary it is to talk to students about the class itself. It is a mistake to as- sume that students' examinations of ideas are entirely unmediated, that the classroom setting has no effect on their thinking. Talking with students about the class, as I suggest in section 4, has helped me to remain critical about my courses, to become accountable to students, and to be open to change. One of the changes I have made as a result of my experiences in the class I discuss here involves the use of response statements themselves. At the time, I was grading one response statement from each stu- dent a week. I would pose questions like those above on individual statements, rate the student's response on a scale from 1 to 10, return it to the writer, and then move on to the next reading and the next set of responses. Under such circumstances, it is understandable why</page><page sequence="21">Deep Response 151 the above student felt he needed to give me what I was looking for: his grade might have depended on it. Borrowing from composition theory, I now structure the use of responses so that they may reflect a continual dialogue: students keep journals that represent their ini- tial responses to texts, the comments that I and other class members make on their responses, and any additional entries the writer might include, entries regarding their readings or anything else they might consider pertinent. I grade these response journals only at the end of the term, after I read and comment on them throughout the semes- ter, and what I "look for" is students' commitment to issues raised in class. Also, I now read my students' responses from an ecofeminist standpoint throughout the semester, so that this dialogue has a chance to unfold. In the class I describe above, students did not have the time or space to stake out their claims as intellectuals, since I did not allow them the opportunity to examine more of the complexities of ecofeminism, such as questions over attempts to establish the rela- tive values of the individual parts of nature (Kheel, 139), the (dis)- advantages of working within a dualistic paradigm (Kheel, 144-45; King, 123), and the ecofeminist critiques of deep ecology (Salleh, passim) and other versions of feminism (Warren, 8-17). As a result, I found myself more in the role of the enlightened instructor bring- ing his news to the duped masses than of an equal participant in a cultural dialogue. A dialogic pedagogy should situate the teacher in the role of learner as well as instructor. I did learn a lot about my students and their beliefs; however, our week-long discussion had only al- lowed us to scratch the surface of ecofeminist issues. My students had not learned enough about ecofeminism to enter into a debate that could be considered democratic, and my authority as "teacher- as-acculturator," as Bizzell would call it, was never as "provisional, shifting, and changing" as it ought to have been (200). In the limited amount of space and time I had allotted students to consider eco- feminism, a negotiation over values never materialized, or at least not to any great extent. Since I wanted my students to become ecofeminists, it was not enough to simply identify the assumptions they held that might dis- rupt their appreciation of ecofeminist ideas. We needed to explore the assumptions that would take the place of the anthropocentric, anthropomorphic ones I was asking them to discard, needed to make</page><page sequence="22">152 ISLE sure the values I wanted students to embrace could remain as heter- archical and dialogic as patriarchy has been hierarchical and mono- logic. We needed to read more, write more, and talk more about the social and ecological crises ecofeminists address, and we needed to read, write, and talk more about the alternatives they propose. In an ecofeminist, dialogical literature class such crises can be addressed, and deep changes in the social fabric can become the course's princi- pal concern. NOTES I would like to thank Robin Pennell and Margery Vagt, who helped me or- ganize the class sessions described in this essay and who allowed me to use their notes, which were invaluable. 1. My conception of "democracy" considers nonhuman nature among the "people" the term connotes. Ecofeminism, and particularly ecofeminist dia- logics, as described by Patrick D. Murphy, represents attempts to facilitate the "coming into verbal being of both sides of the [humanity /nature] dyad" ("Prolegomenon," 48). In this sense, ecofeminist dialogics reflect the democ- ratic impulse described by Bizzell, although it represents a radically ex- panded view of the participants typically involved in democratic processes. 2. One thing that is difficult for me to describe, however, is the response that students might have to such challenges by different teachers. I have heard criticisms about dialogic, democratic pedagogies from women and minority instructors who sometimes feel that their attempts to share power with their students are viewed as marks of inferiority. (I have also heard the same criticisms from graduate teaching assistants who feel that their youth acts against them in regard to negotiations of authority in the classroom.) And I have heard from minority and women teachers who have had their attempts to include multicultural and feministic readings in their curricula looked upon suspiciously as ways to impose their own interests on their students. As a white man, I fit very well the image of the person many students ex- pect to see in their college classroom, and I think my subject position helps students to read my dialogic, ecofeminist pedagogy as something other than a lack of knowledge about the material, an invitation to adopt an "anything goes" attitude toward the class, or an unwarranted use of my authority to advocate the causes of my own race and gender at the expense of white males. On the other hand, there have been occasions where I have been chal- lenged as a man attempting to speak for women and therefore discounted (although I think of my pedagogy as an attempt to create the conditions in</page><page sequence="23">Deep Response 153 which marginalized voices can come into dialogue - not as an attempt to speak for an Other). Ideally, the dialogic method makes such challenges the object of discus- sion. In the same sense, an instructor's accountability for her practices can help to dispel notions that dialogic classes are devoid of purpose or design. With the dialogic method, students and teachers can reflect on the cultural and institutional implications of their attitudes and beliefs (the ways, for in- stance, interpretations of the woman teacher's self-interest might undermine feminist attempts to make life better for women and men; or the way such in- terpretations, as they come to be reflected on student evaluations of teach- ers, might make teachers hesitant to employ dialogic, democratic practices). My point is that the gender, race, age of the teacher (as well as those of the students) can very much determine the students' perceptions of ecofeminist principles; and that while I continue to recommend the dialogic method as a way to address such determinants, I must also caution that the approaches and the responses to ecofeminism that I discuss throughout this essay may have entirely different impacts depending upon the subject position of the teacher.
