<plain_text><page sequence="1">347 The Antiquities Market TIMOTHY KAISER Introduction The market in ancient human artifacts has always had a supply problem. Apart from the resale of objects in the possession of collectors--objects, that is, already in slow circulation-maintaining a profitable market tempo has left dealers with two major options. One possibility is to attempt to create new categories of objects deemed worthy of sale, purchase, and collection; this obviously involves the manipulation of tastes and perceptions so as to imbue previously disdained or ignored objects with new value. The other possibility is far more notorious: the encour- agement of continued mining of known sources for ob- jects of established saleability. The connection, overt or covert, between dealers and those non-archaeologists who dig for artifacts is well known. Far less understood are the diggers themselves. These people, usually called looters, are strangely anonymous in the literature on the illicit market in antiquities. Their names are not known, or, if known, not published. Usually only the empty trenches and gaping holes they leave be- hind are all that is left to mark their progress. For the most part, discussions of why the past is put up for sale conclude (without more than cursory investigation) that the economic straits in which these suppliers find them- selves are so dire that looting is an attractive solution. The following article by David P. Staley seeks to de- velop a better understanding of the market's supply side through a look at the lives of a group of Bering Sea natives who engage in what Staley calls "subsistence digging." Certain inhabitants of St. Lawrence Island spend some time every year excavating and selling ancient ivory and other artifacts, an activity which brings them some profit. These objects command high prices when they reach the centers of the art market. Recently, a New York dealer was asking $17,500 for an ivory anthropomorphic drum handle, with inlaid metal eyes, said to date to A.C. 600 and to have been excavated on St. Lawrence Island. The dealer, Jeffrey R. Myers, apparently makes a point of spending a part of his summers on St. Lawrence, which is when subsistence digging is done. Staley's article will also be of interest to those who enjoy the ethical dilemma of who owns the past. Since St. Law- rence is owned by its natives, their excavations are not illegal. Since they are unearthing the possessions of their own ancestors, can any outsider object? T.K. St. Lawrence Island's Subsistence Diggers: A New Perspective on Human Effects on Archaeological Sites DAVID P. STALEY University of Alaska, Anchorage The problem of archaeological site destruction is receiving much deserved attention from the archaeological profession and from the public. Native subsistence diggers are sgnificant agents of destruction in Alaska and their situation is representative of third world conditions. A case study, featuring the St. Lawrence Island community of Gambell, Alaska, describes the subsistence diggers' attitudes and motivations. This study provides insights into behavioral aspects of archaeological looting, causal factors underlying site destruction, and the internal workings of the artifact market. The Gambell case illustrates an ethical dilemma that needs to be addressed, since newly adopted policies to curtail site destruction may cause significant harm to a Native population that is compelled by economic forces to cannibalize its own heritage. The introduction of alternate sources of cash income through sensible economic development offers a possible solution. Introduction Archaeologists are shaping public policy through lob- bying efforts in the area of cultural resource legislation and through their involvement in the U.S. public educa- tion campaign. The international archaeological commu- nity has been very much concerned with site looting, artifact trafficking, and the ethics of collecting (Messenger</page><page sequence="2">348 Antiquities Market 1989; Neumann 1989; Smith and Ehrenhard 1991; Vi- telli 1984). Major educational campaigns, supported by government agencies and professional organizations, have been launched to enlighten the public regarding the im- portance of heritage preservation (Hoffman and Lerner 1988; McManamon 1990; Rogge 1988). This is now the archaeologist's primary weapon against the destruction and degradation of historical and archaeological sites. While archaeologists are actively attempting to influence public attitudes and policies, we know very little about the people involved in site destruction. With few excep- tions (Gramann and Vander Stoep 1986; Nickens, Lar- ralde, and Tucker 1981; McAllister 1991), the behavioral aspects of looting and trafficking and the factors under- lying the destruction of sites have not been evaluated. Native subsistence diggers are significant agents in site looting in Alaska (Crowell 1985; King 1991; Morton 1989: 2; Staley 1990: 22-23). I opt for the term "digger" since both "looter" and "pothunter" have negative con- notations and do not apply well in this situation. In this article, the subsistence digger is defined as a person who uses the proceeds from artifact sales to support his or her traditional subsistence lifestyle. My usage of "traditional subsistence" follows that of Wenzel, who described the notion as having ". . . little to do with the technology used but much to do with internal relations . . ." of a culture (1991: 180). The term subsistence includes "cul- tural values that socially integrate the economic relations of a hunting peoples into their daily lives" (Wenzel 1991: 57). For the most part, subsistence diggers have been either overlooked by investigators of the problem or con- sidered a limited regional phenomenon (Christensen et al. 1988; Nickens 1991; McAllister 1991). In contrast with other destructive agents, very little is known of the sub- sistence digger's situation, attitudes, or motivations. On St. Lawrence Island, Eskimos are mining their an- cestral archaeological sites (Scott 1984; Wardell 1986). The case study presented here, focusing on the community of Gambell, Alaska, contributes to an understanding of human impact on archaeological sites and highlights the Native subsistence digger. A brief summary of conditions and factors illustrates the extreme nature of the situation in Gambell. Economic conditions in the community are bleak (Little and Robbins 1984), yet St. Lawrence Island ivory artifacts are world renowned, and delicately carved pieces command high prices (Wardell 1986). Unlike raw or fresh ivory, trade in old or fossil ivory is not restricted by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. St. Lawrence is one of the few sources for bulk ancient or fossil ivory sold to artisans and manufacturers. Unrestricted, fee simple title to the island is held by the Gambell and Savoonga village corporations established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971. Thus, since the entire island is privately owned, its lands are not covered under existing laws such as the Archaeological Resources Protection Act. Site access is relatively easy, as three sites are located in Gambell or within a short walking distance. Destruction of sites around Gambell has been so severe that the sites have lost their National Historic Landmark status (Morton 1989: 2). During July and August of 1991, I monitored a mu- nicipal construction project in Gambell. In my "off" hours, I wandered about the sites, observed work in prog- ress, and visited with local diggers and traders. Much of the information presented in this case study was personally observed or learned through these conversations. The Setting Gambell is a Yupik community located at the Nw end of St. Lawrence Island (FIG. 1). Only one other commu- nity, Savoonga, is located on the 160 km-long island, which is situated less than 65 km from Siberia and 200 km from the Alaskan mainland. In 1990, Gambell had a total population of 525 people. At that time, 317 adults lived in the community and the median age was 24.2 years. There were 120 houses in Gambell with 4.38 persons per household (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1991: 33). The people of Gambell are engaged in a mixed cash and subsistence economy, with the latter being more impor- tant (Little and Robbins 1984: 64; John Muir Institute, Inc. 1984: 112). A considerable amount of cash income is required for subsistence pursuits (Nowak 1977; Van- Stone 1960; Wenzel 1991: 106-133). A decade ago, a family would spend an average of $6700 each year on transportation, weapons, ammunition, and fishing equip- ment used in subsistence pursuits and an additional $1700 per year on gasoline. In 1984, the average family paid out $3800 for goods and food. This included primarily cereals, tea, coffee, sugar, pilot bread, soda, and cigarettes (John Muir Institute, Inc. 1984: 121). Of course, prices have increased over the last decade. For example, in 1991, a household of seven persons spent between $200 and $300 a month on food alone. A delayed barge delivery during the summer temporarily drove gasoline prices to $5.00 per gallon, although eventually prices returned to $2.50. Other monthly expenses included $74 for water and sewer services, $72 for cable television, $70 for electric service, and a heating fuel bill around $345 a month during winter. Jobs are relatively scarce and extremely dependent upon State and Federal appropriations. Based on a community survey of Gambell conducted by the Norton Sound</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 20, 1993 349 RUSSIA Gambell Nome, A L A S K A St. Lawrence Island m Anchorag Juneau - . , o490 Kilometers Figure 1. Map showing the location of the study area. Health Corporation during 1990, 51% of 95 household respondents were unemployed. Only 22% of these house- holds included a member with full time employment (Don Smith, Bering Strait Economic Development Corpora- tion, personal communication, 1991). Monthly wage in- come in Gambell averaged $85 per person (Alaska De- partment of Labor, personal communication, 1991). This income was supplemented by food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Energy Assistance, Longevity Bonus, and Permanent Fund Dividend programs. The production and sale of crafts, particularly ivory carvings, is a large source of locally generated income on the island. During the 1980s, ivory-carving sales volumes were esti- mated at approximately $100,000 per year (Little and Robbins 1984: 68). Between September, 1983, and Oc- tober, 1984, sales of bulk ivory mined from sites netted more than $100,000. Sales of artifacts totalled around $40,000 in 1983 (Crowell 1985: 20). An analysis of av- erage household income and expenses during 1991 dem- onstrated the critical importance of both the subsistence oriented economy, 48% of the expenses, and cash influx from ivory and artifacts, 13% of the income. Sales of ivory and artifacts are especially important because household budgets appear to be operating in a break-even or deficit mode. Since 1983, Sivuqaq, Inc., Gambell's village corporation established under ANCSA, has been actively involved in the sale of bulk ivory (Crowell 1985: 21-22). The cor- poration acts as a middleman in the trade, providing a consistent, accessible market for the ivory diggers and attempting to maximize economic returns to the resident shareholders. The village corporation's perception of ar- chaeological sites as economic resources is contrary to the perspective of most Native groups in the United States. Native groups generally advocate protection and conser- vation of historical and prehistoric sites (Nichols, Klesert, and Anyon 1989; Anyon 1991). Sivuqaq, Inc. sees ar- chaeological sites as the source of extractable commodities, whereas other Native groups perceive cultural resources as a means to economic development but through a com- bined strategy of preservation and tourism (Parker 1990: 67). Gambell's Subsistence Diggers The entire demographic spectrum of the community participates in the excavation of Gambell's archaeological sites. Young and old, male and female, single individuals and entire families mine sites for old ivory and artifacts. Children brought to the site may help, but often bring toys to entertain themselves while the adults work. Both employed and unemployed residents work at the sites, although the latter have more time to devote to this ac- tivity. Digging is limited to the summer season while perma- frost sediments are thawing. Ardent diggers tend to work between four and 10 hours a day, while casual diggers are more likely to spend a few hours at a site one evening a week. Although digging may take place at any time, it</page><page sequence="4">350 Antiquities Market seems to be predominantly an evening affair. The work is typically cold, wet, and arduous. A variety of tools and apparatus is used at the sites including simple hand tools such as shovels, mattocks, picks, and buckets. Ice axes, manufactured for mountain- eers, are preferred by both serious and casual diggers. This may be related to their easy access through mail-order catalogs. Wheelbarrows are in short supply; a village en- trepreneur was recently renting one for $20 per day. At times, gasoline-powered portable pumps are used to drain pooled water from excavations. Hydraulic excavation oc- curs at some sites but not at those adjacent to Gambell. Many people leave their tools and equipment at the site between digging sessions. The focus of excavation shifts around on the sites based on other diggers' findings or rumored findings. Rumored success of diggers under one of the few road beds in town caused substantial sections of the road to be torn up in a matter of days. Word of the recovery of potentially valu- able pieces travels fast through the community and often stimulates others to get out and dig. Excavation intensity and technique vary considerably. Men tend to excavate larger and deeper holes. When work- ing by themselves, women and children dig numerous small shallow holes and never invest much time in any one location; but they tend to do more prospecting than the men, who concentrate on mining. Patterns of permafrost thawing also tend to influence excavation strategies and techniques. At present, diggers go to great lengths to find rare, undisturbed sections of the sites. The digging undercuts paths and roads and exposes various pipes, and phone and power lines. At times, diggers are forced to move tremendous piles of backdirt and disturbed sediments extending to depths of 4 m. Plastic covers sur- prisingly deep limits of previous mining efforts. Once undisturbed deposits are located, excavations proceed hor- izontally into the face, sometimes undercutting large blocks of sediments. These blocks frequently give way and negate the time and effort used to clear the area as well as burying equipment and diggers alike. Curious passersby are sharply warned not to walk above these excavations. Diggers often follow house wall logs, as whole walrus tusks are known to have been used to support vertical posts. Other structural elements are often chopped out of the way before they are completely exposed, and rock slab flooring is often torn up as the excavation proceeds. Some of the techniques used by diggers in Gambell were learned directly from archaeologists who have worked in the area. In the late 1920s, Otto Geist experi- mented with boilers and steam thawing as well as using pumps, hoses, pressure nozzles, and screens to hydrauli- cally excavate sites and water screen artifacts (Geist and Rainey 1976: 35, 42). The use of steel rod probes to differentiate subsurface bone and ivory was adopted from Hans-Georg Bandi, who used the technique to locate hu- man burials. One digger stated she had been shown by archaeologists how small artifacts on the surface are more easily observed after a rain storm. Gambell diggers often toss faunal remains into a separate pile as they dig. This behavior may have been adopted from Otto Geist, who also segregated bone into large piles (Geist and Raney 1976: 246). Artifacts The relative importance of various artifact classes to the people of Gambell is expressed in the way they sort, ac- cumulate, and conserve artifacts. Artifacts with certain monetary values are piled separately while digging and bagged at the end of the session. These include complete or fragmentary ivory artifacts with or without incised dec- oration, ivory scrap, walrus tusk and teeth, large sea mam- mal teeth, and walrus penis bones. Artifacts of marginal value or interest, such as seal teeth, groundstone ulus and endblades, palettes, chipped stone scrapers, points or blades, baleen bucket parts, scapula shovel blades, and various whole or broken wood and bone tools, are con- sistently sorted from the dirt and piled near the pit. Some of these artifacts are composite tool parts that are kept separately until the digger is certain that other components are lost. Artifacts are often shown to children, visitors, and other diggers and are the main topic of discussion. Artifacts of marginal value are often displayed on a whale or walrus scapula in or on the margins of the pit. Struc- tural elements, faunal remains, flaking debitage, and small fragments of stone artifacts are either tossed into the back- dirt or segregated into piles. Valuable artifacts are typically amassed until sold to village visitors, professional artifact dealers or, if unmar- ketable as art or curio, eventually sold as scrap ivory. Diggers are anxious to show their artifacts even without any potential for sale. People will invite you into their houses to see their collections. In one home, I saw com- posite fish hooks, harpoon heads, buttons, and a wrist- guard fragment made of ivory and decorated with Punuk design elements. Most collections, however, included large varieties of mundane, undecorated artifacts. Although most household collections are awaiting sale, there are several families that keep groups of interesting artifacts in their homes with no intention of selling them. Old ivory begins to crack, split, and peel after it is removed from the ground. Diggers attempt to conserve</page><page sequence="5">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 20, 1993 351 ivory artifacts using a variety of techniques and substances. Most understand that the problems are caused by too- rapid drying. Therefore, many try to control temperatures and humidity by drying specimens in a cool place inside sealed plastic bags. Others attempt to replace the water in the artifacts by soaking them in baby or gun oils. Staking Claims and Territoriality The passage of ANCSA legally made the natural re- sources on St. Lawrence Island common property and essentially gave all residents access to these resources. Con- trol over the island's natural resources is shared by the village corporations of Gambell and Savoonga. This is the latest step in the liberalization of natural-resource use rights. Prior to ANCSA, each community claimed control over a portion of the island's resources (Burgess 1974: 78). Preceding the consolidation of the population into these communities, territories were controlled by clans (Little and Robbins 1984: 82-83). Even at present, how- ever, clans do maintain use rights over specific camping, hunting, and fishing locations. The archaeological sites on St. Lawrence Island are also considered a common natural resource. There appear to be some differences in use rights, however, depending on the distance between the site and the main village. At sites close to Gambell, diggers who begin an excavation or adopt an abandoned, existing pit have use rights contin- gent on their consistent and continuous work in the lo- cation. Claimed areas are often shared between brothers who may work together or in staggered shifts. These rights may be traded or passed to other individuals, and permission is requested to dig in areas that are not clearly abandoned. During the summer, many families leave Gambell to stay at subsistence camps, which are positioned within larger clan territories at prime subsistence-resource loca- tions (Little and Robbins 1984: 184-205; Crowell 1985: 18). These same resources have drawn people to these locations for millennia. As clan members have use rights for the location, they also have exclusive control over any nearby archaeological resources. Unlike the Gambell sites, there is no requirement for consistent and continuous digging at these sites to maintain use rights. Claims on digging areas at subsistence camps follow the historical, kinship-based pattern of use rights. Closer to Gambell, no clan can claim exclusive rights to an area, therefore, a different system has developed to define dig- ging territories within sites. This system is a reflection of the liberalization of natural-resource use rights but only at the community scale. Future research on this subject may find even further communal ownership, with Sa- voonga residents freely digging at Gambell and vice versa. Use rights to digging territories are generally respected although there are interlopers. It seems likely that inci- dents of encroachment are more common near Gambell than at subsistence camps. Diggers complain about tres- passers more for their sloppy technique than for the po- tential loss of ivory and artifacts. Some diggers have threatened to place booby traps in their pits to discourage poaching by their fellow villagers. Attitudes The people of Gambell are very friendly, generous, and kind. Their attitudes toward the profession of archaeology are generally negative, however. Early archaeological in- vestigations on the island were sophisticated for their time, although by today's standards the methods were coarse, and the large scale trenches through mounds would appear to the uninitiated as uncontrolled massive disturbances. Other than the excavation techniques described above, one can safely assume that little effort was expended toward explaining archaeological method and theory to the resi- dents of Gambell. Before the early archaeological investigations on the island by Otto Geist and Henry Collins, various supersti- tions and fears of the dead made most residents very reluctant to dig at the sites (Keim 1969: 114, 218). Ar- chaeologists had a hand in changing this attitude by pur- chasing artifacts and hiring local assistants (Collins 1975: 25, 31, 35; Geist and Rainey 1976: 25, 31-32; Keim 1969: 150; Scott 1984: 48). Due to a lack of funds, Geist could not pay his assistants an hourly or daily wage. He paid the "volunteers" according to the amount of ivory they uncovered (Geist and Rainey 1976: 32). Geist soon realized the mistake of paying for unprovenienced arti- facts, as residents became uncontrollable diggers. In his biography of Geist, Keim (1969: 115) describes the re- sult: "The car Otto had oiled, greased, and carefully cranked was running away with him and there was not much he could do until it ran out of gas." People frequently complain about archaeologists dig- ging up their sites and, justifiably, about the removal of the artifacts from the island. Historically, collecting arti- facts for museums was a primary reason for doing archae- ology. At present, the lack of an appropriate facility pre- vents curation on the island. The excavation of artifacts by archaeologists is variously presented as a cultural or a financial loss. Crowell (1985: 26-27) has found that buy- ers and collectors tend to support or encourage the notion of the archaeologist as resource competitor. Portions of the population wish the artifacts returned, and some would like to profit from the sale of these returned items.</page><page sequence="6">352 Antiquities Market Others have proposed placing the artifacts in a local mu- seum to be used for educational purposes and also for generating tourist revenues. Many Gambell residents disagree with the position that only archaeologists can extract worthwhile information through controlled excavation of the sites. Local diggers contend that they have learned much about their heritage through their excavations. Traditional craftsmanship, in- novations, architecture, and natural history are all learned from digging. Although not written in reports, heritage learned from digging at the site has been expressed orally to other villagers. In contrast, few, if any, archaeologists have presented their findings to the people of Gambell. Some diggers see their work at archaeological sites as a form of recycling, realizing that previous residents gleaned materials from the sites to be reused or remade into needed tools. Similar attitudes have been expressed to other re- searchers (Little and Robbins 1984: 194; Crowell 1985: 25). The Gambell diggers do not want to intensify their extraction of artifacts. Intensification would merely cause the resource to be consumed too quickly and, thus, a slower pace is preferred. A slow pace maintains prices at current levels and also extends the financial gain into the future. The diggers fear that a sudden, large influx of money would be squandered. In this instance, people do not favor strict conservation to preserve their heritage for posterity, but rather a conservative management style to provide a steady source of cash. Motivations Digging on St. Lawrence Island is fueled by a combi- nation of motives including economic requirements, ed- ucation, tradition, and recreation. Economic conditions provide the primary motive for digging at the sites, and the earlier overview of the Gambell economy and the cash requirements of modern subsistence practices provides a partial context for this discussion. A description of the Gambell ivory market, including rates, prices, and struc- ture is critical for understanding residents' motivations. The return for scrap ivory and artifacts is an important source of the community's cash income. Most of the return comes from the slow, steady recovery and sale of scrap ivory. The purchase price for this commodity varies de- pending upon the size and condition of the pieces, as well as seasonal supply and demand factors. During August, 1991, the prevailing rate for small ivory scrap was $20 per pound. Prices for artifacts destined for the curio or native art markets vary considerably. Mundane utilitarian objects are sometimes sold for a few dollars to a tourist or visitor. More often, these same items are of more value if sold as scrap ivory. Those bound for the art market bring the greatest prices. These pieces include decorated ivory fig- urines, winged objects, tridents, and utilitarian objects of the Old Bering Sea and Punuk periods (Wardwell 1986). It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of sale prices in Gambell as these have become clouded by myth and leg- end. Gambell residents spoke of an ivory ulu handle in the form of a polar bear that was recently sold by a digger for $10,000. Other legendary prices paid to finders range from $45,000 up to as high as $60,000. These prices are most often mentioned in relation to the winged objects or "butterflies." Such large monetary returns, whether real and rare or purely imaginary, are a major driving force in the system. Diggers have several avenues for converting scrap ivory and artifacts into cash. Scrap ivory is purchased by the Native store, the Native corporation, and various visiting private buyers. Visiting buyers may also buy ivory carvings and artifacts. These individuals advertise their upcoming visits through posters and flyers. It was said that in 1991 there was only one buyer, down from the annual average of three buyers, who tended to bid against each other. Several recent developments may now be acting to pre- clude the necessity of actual buying trips on the part of brokers and/or collectors. A Gambell entrepreneur, partic- ularly adept at negotiating and facilitating business deals, has established himself as a middleman between diggers and a New York City buyer. The middleman describes the find to his contact by telephone. If the buyer is interested in a piece, he asks for it to be sent along for viewing. A price is agreed upon and the middleman gets 10% of the sale price. This same middleman has sold a number of pieces for a group of diggers directly through Sotheby's auction house in New York City. He said Sotheby's gets a 5% commission on any of these sales. Many other dig- gers have the capability to sell directly to auction houses, brokers, and collectors. The names and telephone numbers of New York collectors are casually traded among allied diggers. Many have arrangements to call dealers collect or via toll-free numbers. The participants in digging activities are not exclusively those in need of cash. Successful individuals and families, with economic, social, and political power, also dig at the sites. These people often have steady, full-time employ- ment, are whaling captains and boat owners, and may hold or have held political office. Factors other than eco- nomic necessity, such as recreation, education, and tradi- tion, apparently prompt these people. Excavation at the sites is often seen as family recreation that provides edu- cational opportunities. Artifacts are shown to children and</page><page sequence="7">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 20, 1993 353 are placed in a context of modern and traditional lifeways. They are also used to substantiate legends and local oral history. Tradition is also cited as a factor, since people have now been digging in these sites for over 50 years; it has been a socially acceptable activity for several genera- tions. The casual nature of some digging at least partially reflects recreational motivations. The activity provides op- portunities to leave the household, enjoy the outdoors, socialize or find solitude, and get exercise. Digging, as a form of gambling or treasure hunting, provides a recrea- tional thrill. The popularity of this type of recreation is manifested by frequent participation in sweepstakes, lot- teries, bingo, and card playing. In Gambell, many games of chance are well established; community bingo and pull- tabs are especially popular. Expended pull-tabs, also known as "rippies" or "ripoffs," are often found in back- dirt piles at the sites. Extremely worn, small bills com- monly observed in circulation are attributed by locals to heavy use during card games. The largest potential pay- offs, however, are found in another popular game of chance: digging. Finally, the sites are common property, and all people in Gambell have the right to dig. Perhaps families with no economic pressures are motivated to dig in order to maintain their rights to this resource or to guarantee a share of the resource before it is gone. Whatever the non- economic motives, the economic gains from digging are an added bonus. The Ethical Dilemma Current strategies for curtailing the looting problem in the United States include legislation, law enforcement, education, and public involvement. Legislation and law enforcement alone have not been effective. Education and public involvement are the newest approaches to the prob- lem and may eventually have a significant effect, although doubts remain (King 1991). All of these strategies or policies have been advocated by individual archaeologists and archaeological organizations. If these policies succeed in shutting down the demand for artifacts, quenching or deflecting collectors' desires to possess Native American artifacts, and protecting archaeological sites from looting, what will be the effect on the Native subsistence digger? Should archaeologists, as anthropologists, ignore the po- tentially substantial effects of archaeologist-influenced public policies regarding site looting on a group of Native Americans? How will they continue their "traditional" lifestyles which now include technology purchased and maintained by cash? Parallel dilemmas exist in Canada where policies have been generated by animal rights activ- ists (Wenzel 1991: 175); native communities that once had their economic basis in seal hunting have been sig- nificantly disrupted by the seal fur ban. At present, there are no clear and easy solutions to the subsistence digger dilemma. The introduction of alternate sources of cash income combined with present anti-looting strategies could stop site destruction and ameliorate any economic effects on Native groups. The Eskimos of St. Lawrence are extremely wary of large-scale natural resource development. They fear the land will be lost through sales to corporations or individuals who will become majority shareholders in the corporations (John Muir Institute, Inc. 1984: 125; Crow- ell 1985: 23). Elsewhere in the Arctic, non-indigenous development plans have not meshed with traditional sub- sistence pursuits and have not been productive (Wenzel 1991: 183). The people of St. Lawrence must have input into any development schemes if they are to be successful. The two villages on St. Lawrence have joined together in a non-profit venture named St. Lawrence Economic Development Corporation (SLEDCO). Appointments to the 12 member board are evenly divided between the villages and represent Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) councils, City governments, and at-large members from both Gambell and Savoonga. The organization is intended to address all development issues (Don Smith, personal communication, 1991). Several economic development plans currently are being considered for St. Lawrence Island, and short-term proj- ects should continue to provide money to the local econ- omy. The clean-up of World War II debris, airport runway expansions, and other government-sponsored public works projects will provide some employment, but not permanent, full-time jobs. Exploitation of other island- based resources might have more long-term effects. The feasibility of harvesting various seaweeds for sale to the health food and medical industries is actively being re- searched. The reindeer industry is being revived through herd expansions that may increase sales of meat and antler products to Asian markets. The expansion of eco-tourism, particularly bird-watching, is another possible develop- ment for the future (Don Smith, personal communication, 1991). Alternatives must be found that will contribute cash to the local economy, decrease demands for ancient artworks and curios, promote conservation, and increase reverence for the island's antiquities. Hopi and Zuni artisans of the American Southwest use designs from ancient potsherds for inspiration (Stanislawski 1969: 13, 1978: 221-222), and St. Lawrence Island craftspeople could incorporate some of the aesthetic features of earlier works and use</page><page sequence="8">354 Antiquities Market their own cultural heritage in a similar fashion. In this way, their traditional art and heritage would be continually revived and reinforced as something important and mean- ingful. Summary This case study reveals some of the behavioral aspects of looting, examines causal factors underlying site destruc- tion, and illuminates the shadowy world of artifact traf- ficking. Mainly, however, this study has focused on Native subsistence diggers: their situation, attitudes, and moti- vations. As a group, subsistence diggers add a unique level of complexity to the site looting problem in Alaska and elsewhere in the world. The information presented here contributes to a better understanding of the looting-traf- ficking/local economy dichotomy and may ultimately lead to appropriate solutions to the problem. As pointed out by Cheek (1991), what is lacking are Native perspectives on the subject. Further investigations in Gambell would doubtless identify a greater range of concerns and attitudes than those presented here and would more accurately rep- resent the Native perspective. This study presents a com- plicated problem but does not provide solutions. Perhaps, however, it will stimulate professionals to apply some thought to this dilemma. Acknowledgments The anonymous Gambell diggers must be thanked for their candor in discussing this emotionally-charged issue. A number of scholars contributed useful comments, ideas, and information. In particular, I would like to thank Rob- ert Ackerman, Stephen Braund, Aron Crowell, Steven Loring, Ken Pratt, and George Wenzel. Figure 1 is by Ray Norman. David P.
