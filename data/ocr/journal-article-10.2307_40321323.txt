<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Evolution of the Psychical Element, By George Herbert Mead (Dec. 1899- March 1900 or 1898- 1899) Lecture notes by H. Heath Bawden Kevin S. Decker, ed. Note appended to the beginning of the manu- script: Even Prof. Dewey seems to think that the problem is absent from the animal con- sciousness, when he says, "That which was unconscious adaptation in the animal, tak- ing place by the "cut and try" method until it worked itself out, is with man conscious deliberation and experimentation." ("Evo- lution and Ethics," Monist, April 1898, 340). (Cf "Logic of E, 1900,79). (^"Out- lines of Ethics," 158-159. (He doesn't mean the problem is absent, but that con- sciousness of it is.) [1] The relation between the psychology of the Ancients and of the Scholastics The psychology of the ancients was objec- tive in its character. Ancient science consid- ered the soul of man as it did the other objects of investigation, from the stand- point of deductive method. That is, the ancients (pre-eminently the Greeks) aimed to bring to knowledge the ideas and habits that lay at the foundation of their society. They were in search of what had organized the community, not of new principles. Socrates was no less turning to the past in his idea of the education of the good citizen than was Aristotle in his deductive logic - knowledge based upon memory. The character of ancient science, from the standpoint of method, was that the univer- sal existed apart from the particular which suggested it or was its possibility, and also independent of the reason that perceives it. The universal, with them, was in no sense the product of thought or activity. The atti- tude of the thinker toward the universal was that of passive perception. There might be ethical and emotional identification of the thinker with the universal reason, but the TRANSACTIONS OF THE CHARLES S. PEIRCE SOCIETY /nn Vol. 44, No. 3 ©2008 480 /nn</page><page sequence="2">attitude of the reason remained that of contemplation. [2] What the H modern mind regards as the resultant of the process of knowledge and a of intelligent conduct (the universal, the law, the principle, the rule, the &lt; habit), is conceived of by the ancient mind as given independent of the £■* thinker or doer. Ancient method was bringing into explicit conscious- 5' ness the universals implicit in actual thought and action. o The modern scientist seeks to find in the particular a new universal, a ^ new meaning not involved in the interpretations of the past. The ancient fiT scientist sought to draw out of the attitude or action of the thinker Í? toward the particular what was the universal already given in that attitude g- or action. Socrates thus called the dialectic of philosophy the art of the Q midwife to birth (into explicitness) what was already there (implicit). £a Hence their analysis was the analysis of the objective, physical world, and g* subjective phenomena or world, the psychical, was valueless. The cate- g gory of subjectivity could appear only when scientific analysis was willing ^ to break up the universal as then existing, that a new universal [3] might *SP arise. While this process is taking place, elements have for the time being O only subjective validity, i.e., they are psychical elements. 2 The general method of the ancient world in reflective thought con- n&gt; fines itself to bringing to consciousness the universals involved in their jf past interpretations of their environment, and their reactions upon it. Er As long as their analysis went no further than this, there could be no 2 room for category of subjectivity; there could be no such element as the S psychical element of modern consciousness, for their search was for the g^ real, that which was objectively valid. What fell short of this fell within the field of non-being, [what was] not within that of being. It follows ^ that the so-called psychology of the ancients attacks the problems of w sense-perception, conception, the organization of conduct, and the 5 emotions from that common to our psychological enquiry. We have oo described it as objective, that is, the object is never analyzed beyond its q objective meaning as recognized by any one sense. A seeming contra- £ diction to this is found in the primary and secondary qualities of mat- £ ter [4] described by Democritus and the Atomists. But though the * secondary qualities are in a sense subjective and representative of a real- o ity lying beyond, this subjectivity has no epistemological value. This is, the ultimate element into which the object is analyzed is not a subjec- tive one. The fact of subjectivity is an indication of lack of reality which must be interpreted into a being which is purely objective. Thus ulti- mately for Democritus the objective realities were indivisible bodies of varying size, form, and weight, of which we have immediate knowledge through the reason. For all ancient thought the real is given through the reason and not through sense-perception. What comes through sense- perception is the form which suggests the reality. The process of per- ception is entirely unanalyzed. The action of the reason in perception cannot be analyzed any more than the object itself. The analogy of sight ^g</page><page sequence="3">co is the one which governs almost universally the thought of the ancients &lt;u in regard to the perception of reality by the reason. In some way the p soul comes into contact with the real object and perception follows as a d natural result. It is, then the interest of the thinker that determines the Z line of his psychological statement. Plato's interests, in being predomi- ^ nantly ethical and political, [5] he analyzes the human soul from stand- &lt;u point of the state. Aristotle, again, brings his scientific observation to S bear and connects human life with whole process of life upon the sur- -g face of the earth. For neither is there any ultimate series of phenomena í&gt; such as sensations or ideas in the sense of Locke, or images or impres- ^ sions out of which all the world of consciousness must be built up and ^ organized. The fundamental distinction in both of these thinkers is ^ between the reason and the lower powers. The reason is immortally HH cognizant of reality, and belongs to another world than that of sense- £- i perception. In a word, the concept is regarded as given immediately and QJ the processes of sense-perception have value only as they suggest this &lt;J concept. Instead of the concept being the final result of the process of c/D knowledge, it is the primary fact, though the limitations of our nature 2 require the action of the less valid organs of sense-perception to awaken &lt;3 us to realities that lie behind these shows. The Sophist set up the erite- mi rion, "Man is the measure of all things." [6] [However], ancient scepti- H cism differed from that of Hume. (1) The ancient scepticism was one of the subject-matter of knowledge (scepticism as to the reality). Hume's scepticism was one of the subject-matter of knowledge (scepticism as the reality). Hume's scepticism was one of method; how can we know anything. (2) The ancient sceptic tended toward nihilism as to reality, the modern sceptic toward agnosticism as to the possibility of reliable knowledge. (3) The ancient made an attack on the validity of knowl- edge and left: it there. The modern did this and set up a new (sensa- tional, subjective) reality. It is that in experience which leads to a reorganization of experience, which leads to the activity-experience, which we will call objective. Doubt is subjective and individual. Decision (with execution) is objec- tive, social. The ancient did not distinguish, in this sense, the subjective from the objective, [if we] accept perhaps a few exceptions among the Stoics. Plato's analysis of the human mind is an objective-social analysis. [7] The psychical as such is essentially particular. Democritus made the distinction between the atoms and the impression which a certain col- location of these might make on the individual; but his interest was not that of Locke, so he did not take the further step and distinguish the latter, the sensations, as subjective and the former as objective. Dem- ocritus, like Plato, held that anything particular {subjective as we would say) belonged to the realm of not-being, [and] was of relatively no ,~~ value. It is only the universal that is real to the ancient world. We ree-</page><page sequence="4">ognize in the particular a universal that is coming into existence. But H the ancients never saw this. In this sense that ancient never grasped the a principle of induction ([that was] left to Bacon). Aristotle divides the &lt;: soul into three different moment: (1) the vegetative, (2) the sensitive £T and (3) the rational. He took his analogy from the lower animals, rather 5' than from the social individual, subjective, human standpoint (of o introspection). [8] Greek life and philosophy was indeed subjective, ^ compared with other ancient nations, but not consciously or self- n&gt; consciously, or reflectively subjective. It is one thing to be subjective £? and another thing to reflect upon this, to analyze this subjectivity. The §- whole of Christianity was subjectivity (a certain spiritual frame of £ mind, a certain emotional attitude), not the performing of the cere- ^ monies of a cult like the heathen religions; yet Christianity was not 2* reflectivity subjective. Not until the modern [Renaissance] did con- g scious subjectivity arise. The ancient psychology or philosophy was * deductive, [and] dealt with the individual as an instance of a universal. ^ it was essentially sceptical and nihilistic when it departed from this. To O the ancient world subjectivity meant the loss of the universal, meant g scepticism. The induction so-called was not our sense of the word, but &lt;r a mere recognition of the universal in the particular as an instance. jf Modern psychology and philosophy is inductive, and deals with the 8- individual as the particularizing of the universal. [It is a] more con- 3 structive type of negativism or scepticism. To the modern world sub- S jectivity means the finding of a new universal, and scepticism is £^ reconstructive. The modern world reinterprets and reconstructs from the particular a new universal. [9] The Greek psychology did not ^ attempt to isolate the psychical phenomena. [It] adopted a sort of ema- w nation theory. The form of the object is conceived as coming into con- g tact with the soul. The value which the perceived object has is not go analyzed as subjective value. Aristotle's and Plato's colors and sounds are q universal reals, not subjective particular sensations. £ The Greek psychologists did not, like the modern psychologist, £ abstract from the ethical value of the emotions. It is the ethico-objective * aspect of emotion which is their chief interest. We throw this whole j-j evaluation of feeling into a separate science. The Sophists simply denied these ethical judgments: their attitude was essentially negative and destructive. Modern scepticism, whether epistemological or ethical, is essentially constructive; compare Hume, Kant, Hamilton, Spencer. In the post-Aristotelian philosophy the interest centers rather around the "wise man," the "philosopher," than about the Athenian Citizen as in Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. We take a step toward the analysis of subjectivity. The philosophic psychologist frees himself from the purely social and [10] objective analysis of man. In St. Augustine we have the positing of the state of consciousness as the ultimate criterion of reality. [There is a] gradual movement and narrowing of reflective ,~~</page><page sequence="5">ro thought of the emotional (particular, subjective) consciousness of the &lt;u individual (from Aristotle to Augustine). St. Augustine and Descartes g developed and used the same subjective criterion, yet there was a great 3 difference in that in Descartes a distinct psychical phenomenon was felt Z and recognized, while in Augustine this was not yet clearly seen. In 3 Augustine we have also (passing by Aristotle, etc.) the influence of the &lt;u element of will upon the process of knowledge. Quite foreign to this is 6 the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. So also the Stoic idea of temper- - ance and happiness, that the virtuous man need not suffer, implies that í&gt; he has control over the emotional state. [This is] still more clearly ^ brought out in St. Augustine than in the Stoics. In St. Augustine we ^ find a combination of the principle of the Stoics with Christianity and &gt;-v Ecclesiastic conceptions. HH Just as the conquest of Rome began when the Romans [11] began to fi take the Teutons into the Roman army, so the growth of the analysis of QJ subjectivity began as the individual found himself, as the individual for &lt;J the time being becomes isolated from the social order. Christianity c/D tended also to foster and develop this principle of individuality, and Z self-analysis, and isolation, and withdrawal from society. The technique &lt;J of psychical analysis was not developed until practically the last century. P^ The whole tendency is toward the focusing of the consciousness upon H the analysis of the individual, in this ancient amalgamation of the Bar- baric nations of the North with the Learned nations of the South, in which the Teutons furnished the impulse of freedom and individuality and the Graeco-Romans the conservatism and form. For the Greek, the opposition was between the relevant or meaning element (universal) in the object and the irrelevant (particular), un- meaning element, or false and untrue and unreal element. For the Mediaeval the opposition lay not between the necessary and the unnec- essary, between the meaning and the unmeaning, but between the con- crete, naive object of experience and the abstractions of the school. The problem of Nominalism and Realism and Conceptualism could never have arisen in the time of Plato and Aristotle. [12] This led to the analy- sis of the concrete object and thus to psychological analysis. The simple straightforward inquiry of Socrates was to find what was the real end which the individual has or should have in view, which the legislator, the politician, the philosopher employs. What is the real ulti- mate good or end in life? Socrates decided that evil is due to ignorance. If the person knows what is right, once [he] fully grasps the truth, he will act upon it. If you only know what the good thing is, you will do it. Thus arose the problem of knowledge among the Greeks. As this Scholasticism of the Greeks in excerpts and in its decadency was brought to the new semi-barbarian civilization of Europe (Roman Empire) which was largely engrossed in the sensuous and material ends 484</page><page sequence="6">of immediate existence, no wonder that the old Grecian ideals became H greatly altered and degraded and burlesqued. a In Aristotle you get more reality in the individual thing. With Plato 51 the clay is meaningless, void, non-existent, and the idea of the artist ET artificially from without puts meaning into the dead, inert clay. Aris- 5' to tie had more of the conception of the development of the higher out o of the lower, the idea receiving its most perfect expression in the indi- ^ vidual thing. But even with [13] Aristotle the meaning lay rather in the n&gt; form than in the material of the thing, and this "form" was strictly anal- % ogous to Plato's "Idea." Yet Aristotle takes a great step in advance in ree- g- ognizing reality in some true sense in the individual thing (though he £ held this inconsistently). It was an advance over Plato's idea that reality ^ was in the universal only. With Aristotle there is the conception of the g* development (evolution) or growth of the idea or meaning within the g individual object. For Plato reality is like the fetish which has life only " as it is put in from without (participation in the Idea). For Aristotle ^ reality does not exist apart from the thing, but in the thing; he gets the O first true idea of an organism. 2 The opposition for the Middle Ages was not between the important n&gt; and the unimportant but between an immediate naive passionate expe- jj rience of reality and an abstract schematism of reality (abstract ideas). 3* In their own crude handling of the Roman Empire these barbarians 3 smashed almost everything but these abstract ideas of those they con- S quered and these in turn became the conquerors' conquerors. Graeco- g^ Roman civilization conquered the Celto-Teutonic invaders. Abstract # ideas were about the only form of systematic learning that could survive ^ the terrible iconoclasm of these Barbarians from the North with their w impulsiveness and love of freedom. [14] 5 The question for the Mediaevals was not whether logical universals, on as such, existed, but whether the New Jerusalem, the Roman Empire, q etc., existed - supposed concrete realities with which they had to do. £ Going into a Monastery was living out this belief in the reality of a uni- £j versal, the Church. The formalism of the Scholastics (as well as the * asceticism of the ecclesiastics) was the expression of a belief in the exis- o tence of certain universals. The Friars represent a middle principle between the exclusiveness of Monasticism (cloister) which denied the reality of the world and the Empire and the world (which would deny the reality of the spiritual world). They had faith in the universal (Christianity) that it had appli- cations in actual life. They act on the faith and go out from the cloister to carry Christianity to the world. So also the representative of passage from the traditional authority of the priest to the free thinkers and reformers who insist on the freedom of consciousness and that each is his own priest (has direct relations with God). 485</page><page sequence="7">co Greek art expresses the value that is in the, e.g., temple (modeled after oj the Greek house) as it then exists. The value is not ideal and future but g real and present. [15] During the mediaeval ages we see the leavening d effect of ideal conceptions, of what ought to be or may be, not simply of Z what is. A striving out of the present and anticipation of an ideal society. 3} No great castles, fortresses, battlements, walls, in Grecian warfare. No &lt;u protection of some central shrine in the Greeks. But in the mediaeval £ church, for example, we find the expression of the idea of something per- -g manent, striving to express the idea of a society which goes beyond the £&gt; immediate realization. Society, the empire, exists hardly more than as an ^ Idea. Compare, for example, during the later Middle Ages the persistence *2&gt; of the two ideas of the Church and the Empire (Holy Roman Empire). ^ The problem of mediaeval life and philosophy was how to make these ^ ^ ideals real, how to bring up the actual to the ideal; how, for example, to f-H realize the ideal Church or the ideal Empire. The criterion is no longer (as QJ with the Greeks) merely objective, but appeal is made to the subjective &lt;^ consciousness. In the Mediaeval cathedral there is something that goes oo beyond society as it is, the common-house idea. The artist is [16] thrown ^ back largely upon his own consciousness for the development of the ideal &lt;¡ phase of worship. The artist is subjective in the sense of prophetic, as con- On trasted with the definite finished completeness and retrospective cre- H ations of the Grecian artist. The Mediaeval Cathedral stands for an idea, an ideal, which cannot be given perfection in the sense of definite and finished, done-up, form. [There was an] idea of progress, something more than the simple logi- cal schematism of the past. The whole conception of Magic, which is so closely allied with learning of the Middle Ages, is an expression of the prophetic feeling of the consciousness of the Mediaeval philosophy and life. There is no abstract industrial or artistic technique in a naive com- munity, even among the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. The objects of experience are unanalyzed in their use. But in the Mediaeval Ages where the artist and artisan is striving to embody in actual form the idea of something that does not yet actually exist there arises the necessity for, and development of, a technique. This reflective technique involves the analysis, by abstracts, of the object in its use. This is a subjective process. [17] There is nothing in the structure, for the Greeks, of the Greek temple which involves the consciousness of the builders of a the- ory of stresses and strains. Their remarkable instincts into art principles were instinctive. So too even with the Roman arch. But when you reach Mediaeval Society we find a tendency to surpass the immediate and present and actual and the striving (for example, in the cathedral) to express and create something which shall go beyond what has been and is in the immediate community in which it is found. So also with the Castle which stands in a sense for the Empire, as the Cathedral stands ,R , for the Church.</page><page sequence="8">The discoveries of Galileo were not the discoveries of a single genius, H but the coming to consciousness of the principles involved in the new a problems which arose in connection with Mediaeval architecture and &lt; warfare. Real inductive process [es] had begun in the Mediaeval Ages, £T and all real induction roots in a subjective, not in an objective process. 5' The Grecian industry and art and life were objective and deductive in o this sense. Nominalism is the abstract statement of this. The fact of the ^ individual experience is set up as the reality and not the sheer universal n&gt; idea; which according to this doctrine is a mere name. [18] 5* The philosophy of the ancient world was a philosophy of recogni- g- tion (of the individual as an instance of the universal). The philosophy £ of the Mediaeval world was a philosophy of suggestion (of something ^ not yet realized or visible). The philosophy of the ancient world was 8* realistic. The philosophy of the Middle Ages was nominalistic (sym- g bolic). The philosophy of the Modern world is conceptualistic and ^ methodological. The philosophy of nominalism sets up the particular ^ object as representative of the universal. This philosophy was suggestive C) in the sense of looking toward a new universal, a new world. This psy- g chological object of Mediaeval philosophy was indeed representative of n&gt; the old universal in the sense, but its distinctive character was that it jf was representative or suggestive of a new universal. The object comes to 3- be valued only insofar as it has a subjective character (and this means an 3 individual character). It is the use which is gradually made of this state- 2 ment and conception of the object in psychological terms, that forces a ^ gradual analysis of the psychical in general and makes possible a psy- chological and epistemological technique. [19] « Philosophical problems never present themselves as purely philosoph- w ical problems, but also as partly practical, religious, political, social prob- 5 lems (cf. Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Augustine, Philo, Jesus, Paul, Bacon, co Descartes, Kant). That which becomes of chief interest is not the old q object as such, but the idea which is representative of the old object, by £ itself, as process, now becomes of chief interest. My sensation, e.g. the £j bent stick in the water is now ignored and it is realized that it is the sen- * sation that is bent. All our modern science from Bacon on is individual o and subjective in the sense that science always proposes to itself a prob- lem and isolates the phenomena in studying them. There is an idealized end in view. This process gradually came to mind as a distinctive tech- nique also in Bacon, for example. It was not, however, the representative character of the sensation that furnished the problem for the Mediaeval philosophers. It was not that the idea or sensation stood for the object that they became interested in the sensation of [20] idea, but it was the suggestive character of their sense-perception which gives rise to the psy- chological and epistemological problem. The representative character of the sensation (the epistemological problem) has relatively lost interest (like the problem of the freedom of the will, etc.) for modern philosophy. ,</page><page sequence="9">ro Our interest now is rather in the suggestive character of the sensation (the &lt;u logical problem or the psychology of meaning). g In the early Mediaeval stage the fact of the change of ideas had not d come to consciousness. The State, Church, etc. were fixed, unchange- Z able and no possibility of change [was] in them. But with Nominalism 3J and Conceptualism, the attention is turned to the front instead of &lt;u backwards and the interest is directed to the formation and psycholog- S ical statement of how the object is formed and how it grows as a psy- - chical object (in the sense of process) also. Attention is turned from the !&gt; representative character of the sensation to the suggestive ideological ^ character of the sensation or idea. It is because the sensation is not +2\ merely representative of the object as known in past experience, but sug- ^ gestive also of a new object (and thus a new universal), that the prob- ^ lem (the psychological problem) ever arose in Mediaeval philosophy. f-H [21] But they hadn't realized that the old object changed, nor how the U new object was (psychologically) suggested in experience. &lt;J Agnosticism and scepticism are essentially a denial that the repre- c/D sentative character of the sensation is of any importance for science, for Z philosophy. Can get along without knowledge of that (cf. Hume, Hux- &lt;3 ley). Facts of immediate experience the only real. Know nothing about Péh the ultimate reality of which the sensation is representative. How the H new idea is related to the old idea is of no importance. The factors involved in the Mediaeval contribution to philosophy were: (1) the prevalency of the psychical element into consciousness by the chain of problems which arose, and (2) the necessity of relating these psychical elements to the world of reality that they were familiar with. The psychical element as such [is] affirmed in consciousness before its function is recognized (reflectively). The concept is the statement of the psychical object in terms of the known object of ecclesiasticism (so in Abelard, for example, who founded conceptualism). [22] Such a con- cept is in the mind of the Creator and the ecclesiastical object (univer- sal) is the reflection of such a concept. We, in thinking the object, get a similar concept if only in limited degree. We think God's thoughts after him. We have in the Middle Ages the genesis and growth of a doctrine of parallelism but known fact[s] expressed in terms of universals, and the psychical fact which is in the mind of the individual as such. Two tendencies arise from this: (1) [the] tendency to lay the stress on the psychic side, carried out by Bacon, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and (2) the tendency to lay the emphasis on the known object (known in terms of the universal), carried out by Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Male- branche. The logic of the Scholastic period was the logic of Aristotle. 488</page><page sequence="10">The logic of the following was based on the logic of mathematics and H gets its final and definitive statement in Kant's philosophy. rt [23] The feudal Lord represents and expresses the concrete reality of 51 the idea of the Holy Roman Empire. The knight-errant represents and £T expresses the idea of a power of governance over and beyond the 5' existing government. He redresses the wrongs of power and those not £ recognized by the authority. So the relation between priest and theolo- ^ gian - represent [s] the mediation between the idea and the present, real n&gt; situation. [That of] the saint and the magician - represent^] the tran- 5? scendence beyond and actual realization of the idea: the future, the g- ideal heaven (cf also the temple and the cathedral). The second terms § in this series [theologian, magician] presented problems which could ^ only be solved by a bringing to consciousness of technique itself, e.g. g" enormous height as contrasted with the breadth of the cathedral con- g trasted with the temple. The new ideas of relations of individuals, etc., " to government (knight-errant vs. feudal lord), the new ideas of relations ^ of individuals to God, contrasting ideas of mediator and of priest (cf O friar and saint and reformer vs. priest), new ideas of the limits and g validity of knowledge (cf. Scholastic vs. magician and scientific pio- &lt;t&gt; neers). So also cf the appearance of city and the free city and the com- jj! mercé of the whole world, going beyond the borders of native land and cr culture: [24] due also to the mixture of Graeco-Latin in Teutonic-Ger- 3 manic bloods and civilization. That is, it points at why the psychical 2 element or disposition was alive in concrete expressions (e.g., the build- g^ ing of a cathedral, the utility of commerce (commodities) for other lands, the extension of territorial bodies, the preparation for the other ^ world, relationship to God, development of machinery - gunpowder, w printing, etc., development of better government (e.g. taxation in 5 England), the realization of certain ideals in art, etc., etc. But the use of en the "long bow" antedated the use of gunpowder in overcoming the q invulnerability of the mailed (armored) knight. This indicated the £ demand for these changes. Gunpowder and printing had brought dis- £j cord in China, but were nonetheless developed, because the Chinese * civilization did not represent a demand for its use (cf the telephone § today). Gunpowder, for example, was at once the product and produc- ing cause, symptom and cause of the form which the control over the psychical element was found. First of all in the study of the laws of motion, Galileo, DaVinci and for this end, the study of mathematics [was] involved. The Aristotelian Physics is but an analysis of [the] object or the idea of [the] object. The Greek Physics was static and deductive. The modern physics thus born developed a new universal, [and] was dynamic, progressive, inductive. Hence the inevitable break-down of the old, fixed, static Ptolemaic sys- tem. [25] The impulse to observation was strong among these astronomers (cf relations with astrology). These observations were at , -</page><page sequence="11">ro first largely made because of their supposed astrological meaning. This qj was the immediate end, to cast the horoscopes of individuals, etc., and g not like the interest of the modern scientist in heavenly bodies in them- d selves, as such (cf chemistry and alchemy). Z The attitude toward nature is thus changed. The interest of the 3J Greek was in his immediate surroundings. Each city even had its own qj temple, Nature, heavens, and in [the] earlier period, its own Zeus. 6 One of [the] effects of acceptance of [the] "universal" was to give to -g any individual a "nature" which is something more, beyond his imme- £&gt; diate surroundings. For example, Christianity gave to the individual a ^ "heaven," a "kingdom of God," and thus an Earth, a world which was ►7- something more beyond the immediate and present. . . . [text lost] . . . ^ contributions of Christianity to civilization. Spirits of [the] dead ,_, became universalized into Devils. The old Greek conception of the f-H earth as round did not get universalized in the experience of [the] mass QJ of people; the Ptolemaic conception of the earth as flat did, hence the &lt;J former theory was not developed until the later Mediaeval period (that c/D is, not universalized). [26] For Aristotle, instead of there being a uni- Z versal nature with one force or energy taking differing forms in differ- &lt;J ent objects, he conceived of differing local forces in the different Ph objects. The great advance made through the contribution of Christi- f- ' anity in the universalizing of nature and its forces. Local spirits, gods and demigods became universalized into one God in subordinate spirit, good or bad. Nature in a sense is free and universalized: [the] universal- izing of nature over against these local deities and later as over against one God. The latter statement of universal laws of motions, etc., was both a scientific statement and the break with the old Aristotelian par- ticularism. Of course, Plato and to some extent Aristotle, had the idea of a central Deity and Creator, but He was concerned to form the world out of eternal models, not as the expression or incarnation [of them]. Aristotle's [thought] was not a genuine idealism, but a realism. In Aris- totle we get the added idea of some movement or progression of the parts of object[s] toward perfection; but still nature is not universalized. The limits of advance or progress of thought and investigation [were to be found in] the local culture. The universalizing force on the religious side came from the [27] Jewish henotheism or monotheism (idea of Jehovah), the Dryads (tree spirits), river gods, mountain gods became merged into one God of all nature. But as long as every part of nature is thought of as merely an act or manifestation of God, the mediaeval thought would make no advance, any more than the old Graeco-Roman particularism. Science was not born until the universalizing process went beyond the merely religious reality (God) to nature itself - e.g. force, motion, etc. The mediaeval conception of [the] "wise man" is [of] that one who has control over the ,q0 different departments of Nature and can produce these objects. Those</page><page sequence="12">in Totemism, Fetishism, and Graeco-Roman Particularism (i.e. local H deities) were produced only by appeal by the particular spirit, etc. Out a of the magic possessed by the "wise man" developed the beginnings of &lt; science and the basis of science grows out of [the] universalizing ten- JT dency present in that magic as employed by the "wise man" and [his] 5' control of Nature. Magic was the expression of that which science ^ might do through its relation to nature as a whole. [28] This was the ^ imagination which could be accomplished in and through nature n&gt; enlarged, and the resonances and unity of Nature emphasized. The 2? mythological and anthropomorphic nature of [the] Graeco-Roman g- world gives place to a larger conception of a universal nature under the q' control of a central deity (a modified, Grecianized Jehovah). The pan- ^ theon with all the different gods gives place to the idea of one God 5" (though the polytheism lingers in the doctrine of the trinity; cf. the g great controversies over the divinity of Christ, showing the tendency ? toward a greater, more though-going universalization, through the x? struggle between the two tendencies). O This concept of nature is social [in] that it goes beyond the experi- 2 enee of the individual. The concepts of sacrifice, expiation, atonement « to local gods become modified; he becomes gradually set free from the jj&lt; bonds of [the] culture. This universalization tended to take away all cr freedom and individuality and put the authority of the Church univer- 3 sal or the state (empire) universal in its place. The universalization went S too far. The Renaissance and Reformation were reassertions of individ- £^ uality. With science, which had to begin with the individual, we have an opportunity also for the reassertion of the freedom of the individual. ^ Cf. [the] magician seized by a German prince and [29] forced to carry w on his experiments and if possible to create gold for his treasury. What 5 he did discover was porcelain (the particular glaze that makes the mod- on ern manufacture of porcelain possible). q All this progress is dependent upon the relationship of the mediaeval $ European civilization to the transcendent idea, something new that goes £j beyond the actually realized experience; that something new can come to * birth only in and through the individual. The "Empire," the "Church," o the "Learning" and the "Science" that go beyond the existing social habi- tat (environment) is the basis, source, of development of the psychical element as it arises in the development of European civilization. It is this from the discovery, transcendence, which is the chief mark of modern science as compared with ancient science (which is deduc- tive and a priori). The "magician" in the Middle Ages represents the sci- entific individual, just as "saint" represents the religious individual, just as the "knight savant" represents the governmental individual. [30] This passage from a narrower habitat to the individual (conception of nature) was a gradual passage form the local (cultural) habitat to uni- versal (new universal) transcendent idea of a new habitat. The merging ,</page><page sequence="13">ro of the Oriental and Jewish with the Greco-Roman and later the amal- ¡u gamation or fusion of this composite with the Teutonic-Germanic leads g to the transcendence in idea of the local habitat and hence the move- rá ment (change which we interpret as progress) of civilization, political, Z industrial, religious, and social. Giordano Bruno represents the first ^ beginnings of science, growing out of a magic which is universalized. &lt;u All these advances represent eventually an appeal to the individual con- £ sciousness; in consciousness with some particular problem only arises '-g the psychical element, and the criticism and modification of technique £&gt; implicit in the element, and later criticism, interpretation and modifi- ^ cation (control) through such reflection of further development of such ^ psychical techniques. ^ The Mechanics of [the] ancient world were static [and] never dealt HH with motion as such, but in [the] object (the result of motion). Before f-H L. Da Vinci and Galileo we get a Mechanics (Dynamics) of motion, as QJ such as the conception of a universal motion. Motion is not defined by &lt;^ the object, but the object by the universal laws of motion. The old con- c/D cept of mechanics lingers with us in our popular ideas (so persistent) of ^ the suns rising and setting, of a light body rising and a heavy body &lt;J falling (the new idea of motions of attraction and repulsion), of recip- P^ rocal causation, instead of weight or lightness by coincidence as in [31] H the object. The greatest problem in the application of old geometrical conceptions (static) of results of motion to the process of motion (dynamic) and e.g. [the] application to the case of [the] falling body in which the velocity is increasing. [One] has to theoretically (ideally) stop the falling body to measure its velocity, etc., etc. How [to] get a state- ment of (actually) constantly increasing velocity, in terms of geometri- cal method (mathematical method) of the old world. Out of these difficulties was developed our modern Algebra. The Algebra that had been developed before was only to the end of a fuller geometry (static). In Descartes and Leibniz we have a definite attempt to produce a mathematics which should be able to cope with these difficulties. The characteristic thing about modern algebra is that it states the way in which the geometrical figure is drawn or constructed. Geometry repre- sents the result of motion. Algebra represents the way in which that motion takes place, the process by which the geometrical figure is constructed. An attempt [is made] in the equation to state the process [in] which the geometrical figure results. (The distinction between geometries] is fundamental, e.g., to the upright position of man, con- trolled by relation and reference to a distant object. But that is static: from [the] upright position, static equation of two sides of [the] field of vision on each side of [the] radius of vision.). Algebra is like the process of locomotion, movement (dynamic): steps forward defined by our bilateral symmetry (walking is a falling ,~~ forward), the dynamic equation between the radius of vision and the</page><page sequence="14">steps by which the terminus ad quern is reached. [The distinction is] H first arithmetical and then algebraic. The one term in the equation (sta- a tic) serves to analyze the other (dynamic) (If we didn't have a bilateral &lt;: structure, our mathematics probably would be based in the equation). £f [32] The analytical (content) [of] mathematics (static) is tran- 5* scended by a geometrical (functional) mathematics (dynamic; rest is o stated in terms of motion, etc.). Even the causal relationship between ^ physical objects is fully stated only functionally in which the content n&gt; analysis of independent objects disappears, or rather, is transcended. 2? The new dynamics of functional mathematics (algebraic) represents £- [the] "what" of objects in terms of what you can do with them. To work £* out the equation of a circle it is on the basis that it is a polygon with an ^ infinite number of sides; so the equation of a straight line is on the basis 2"* that it is a series of an infinite number of points .... algebra for the g breaking up of the whole line (e.g., curve, circle) to the development of ^ a method for the construction of such a line. The quantity (unity) is ^ made small enough to ignore it (both something and nothing). The O tendency is to get the method, process of construction of figures, and to g get away from the segments, from static limits. Algebra is an attempt to n&gt; get the method of motion, of the dynamic. jf Europe is face to face with a situation in which the different forces cr of nature had been abstracted from the objects, so that these various 3 motions presented problems which Europe tried to attack in the old 2 (geometrical) mathematics; that mathematics is inadequate, so a new g_ mathematics (algebra) is developed. [33] Descartes', Spinoza's, Leibniz's 9 interests were largely mathematical and physical and largely a direct ^ interest in philosophical methods as such. ^ On the continent, Descartes (and Spinoza), Leibniz developed on 5 the basis of mathematical forms a restatement in mathematical language c/&gt; of deductive forms of ancient and scholastic philosophy. Their method q was a sort of metaphysical algebra in which what answered to the equa- £ tion took the place of the old fixed concept (universal). They still, how- £j ever, conceive of the concept as "objective," of "faculties" as fixed and * objective [while] the old logical "universals" became the source of psy- § chical processes. There is no statement of the psychical element as indi- vidual; it was still in terms of a universal consciousness, cf. Leibniz's monadology. The psychical elements (individuals), even in Leibniz's atomistic monadology, are not subjective in the English sense, but still objective, though the statement is made in the terms of [the] "faculty" of each monad. There are implications in Leibniz as in Spinoza of the English idea of the freed and subjective psychic element, but the [34] trend of Continental thought is away from the English "subjectivism." The whole world of feeling (the most individual of psychical elements) was for Leibniz a confused, vague world, something which in the com- plete experience of the monad was [a] complete intellectual statement. ,</page><page sequence="15">ro (Look up Leibnizian-Wolffian statement and its relation to [the] process &lt;u of dialectical intelligence and hence in Kant, the Continental that was *g affected by the English movement - also in Voltaire.) What sort of state- d ment was Wolff (following Leibniz) really trying to make? How philos- Z ophy gets back to the individual in Kant and what kind of an individual ^ it is (cf. Caird on this). &lt;u Spinoza was not primarily a mathematician, though he gave his phi- £ losophy mathematical force, but a philosopher. Leibniz (like Descartes) - was in his philosophy strongly influenced by his mathematical think- í&gt; ing. The significant conclusion of Leibniz, the marriage of mechanics ^ and teleology, was justified by Kant, though his (Leibniz's) wrong (7- method was criticized (cf effect of Locke upon Voltaire). ^ [35] In Descartes' "Cogito, ergo sum," we have the beginning of a ^ movement coming to an acme in Kant, in which the psychical element, £-h as such, receives recognition, though in Descartes we find also the dual- QJ ism of the Middle Ages still dominant (thought and extension: cf Spin- &lt;^ oza). Descartes did not recognize the immediacy of the psychical co element so far as he recognized its clearness and distinctness. By doubt Z he sweeps away the rest of experience and here in that self- &lt;3 consciousness ("Cogito, ergo sum") he finds a bit of virgin self-con- 04 sciousness unsoiled by contact with derivative experience. He gets the H idea of [an] immediate fact, but he doesn't stop with it: with Descartes the "Cogito, ergo sum" is an inference. The dictum is seemingly of use, not as with Hume and Kant, as the ultimate analytic of reality, but [as] a basis of reference only. [There is a] great difference thus between Descartes and Hume. Descartes says, "I think, therefore I am" in the logical scheme of reality. Descartes starts off with that bit of self-con- sciousness, but he uses it to relate himself in an already (implicitly) determined world of reality. There is no more content in the Cartesian self than in the Scholastic formal unit (of analysis); it is not an [36] organized self in any sense. The English psychological philosophers take up the clue which Descartes merely uses thus as a basis of reference and recognize the same quality in other elements of consciousness. Find a root in English soil: Hobbes, Locke, Hume. We here have a widening range of factors of consciousness which are recognized as psychical ele- ments, though they still struggle pitiably in the toils of objectivity! Regards thoughts as things. The secondary qualities (attributes) at least are found in the individual consciousness, though the objectivity is still retained from the general idea (universal) of substance. Then comes Berkeley with his individualistic and solipsistic trend, and knocks out the remaining "objective" category. Yet here again we find inconsis- tency. But with Hume (perhaps England's greatest, [or] at least most consistent thinker) we find [the] whole objective world carried over into the subjective individual consciousness, even substance and attrib- 404 ute, cause and effect. Steady movement toward the translation of [the]</page><page sequence="16">objective world into [the] subjective world, in terms of content, and in [37] terms of form. It is the matter, the filling, the content, that is emphasized in England as subjective. On the continent, emphasis is put on the form and not on the content. We have still the dualism of facts of sense as over against the intelligible world: the intelligible world, both spiritual and material, being stated in terms of mathematical con- ceptions. Two lines of division must here be kept in mind: subjective (spiritual) and objective (physical or material). That, brought together with the scholastic nominalistic controversy with the outgoing (?) development of [a] conception of [the] self-conscious individual sub- jective element, brought out an opposition between the idea (schema- tized, logical world) and the unanalyzed, unrationalized experience: opposition between the individual in whom is recognized one bit of clear immediate consciousness (experience) and certain physical facts. These two oppositions do not jibe, coincide, with each other. o o A A World of World of immediate Ideas experience Logically Unorganized organized The scholastic, formal, Notions objective, universalized self-consciousness of world. [the] Medieval period [38] Descartes takes a bit of the unorganized individual immediate experience as a basis of reference for all experience, and the problem arises of the relation between the two worlds - [the] logically organized and unorganized worlds. Descartes' and Spinoza's assumption was that if our reason acted completely there would be no vague, indistinct, unorganized experi- ence, but experience would be a logical, intuitive process and compara- ble only to a mathematical equation. They couldn't relate a sensation of color and a sensation of sound except in the logically organized world. They had developed the technique of psychology so that they could relate [such sensations] as conscious processes (as we are beginning to do). But Descartes took as the central basis of reference for this subjec- tive world self-consciousness [here is drawn a circle with a point pre- cisely in the middle], which he then made the basis of reference and all other experiences, but without suggesting where this led, as did Hume. Descartes conceived that [the] /, as self-conscious, was the stable center n&gt; I C rt o' 13 O &lt;-t a» |_ o' E r-t- a O $ se n&gt; i-t O~ CD i-t rt ÉL 2 CO a w n w ¿a w a 495</page><page sequence="17">co of the circle or sphere. His error was in conceiving this self- &lt;d consciousness or / as a formal, logical analytic unity and not content- g wise, psychologically or synthetically. [39] The chief characteristic of 3 this bit of experience Descartes said to be clearness and distinctness; but Z he did not emphasize its aspect of immediacy. That which was known ^£ was this fact in the world of logically organized experience; that which &lt;d was the basis of this knowledge was still in the world of unorganized 6 experience (the most distinct and clear and immediate portion of which *-g is the basis of reference). The subjective, individual, psychical element ì&gt; for Descartes was relatively vaguer and less distinct, vivid and immedi- ^ ate, except as [it] approximated this analytic unity of consciousness ^ which thus belongs really to the world of knowledge. But with the p. development of modern science (with its beginnings in the Renais- &gt;_i sance) and the development of physiology, etc., the new problem f- i emerges of [the] relationship of logical elements in the world of organ- (J ized experience and the psychical elements in the world of unorganized &lt;¡ experience (cf Doctrine of the sea of the soul - pineal gland). The co assumption is (in Descartes) that if the psychical element were com- ÍE^ pletely known it would disappear as such, i.e. as psychical, and become &lt;í purely logical. He didn't get a [40] glimmer into the idea that the psy- P^ chical is the essence and form and that the logical [is] its product. H Descartes' dualism thus tends toward an ideal logical monism (cf [is] its product. Descartes' dualism thus tends toward an ideal logical monism - cf. Leibniz). Instead of motion, space and time, you would have a mathematical equation. The Medieval dualism thus moves toward an ideal logical monism. The effort on the continent as summed up in Leibniz is that the logical world will "eat up" the psychical world. The effort in England as summed up in Hume is that the psychical world will destroy the objective validity (universality, necessity, and self- evidence) of the logical world. (1) Opposition between the idea and the category of experience resolved by his "Cogito, ergo sum," finding this center of self- consciousness in the world of immediacy, clearness and distinctness. Taking this as [the] starting point we begin at his mundus intelligibus. The world of psychical elements tends to disappear. He had substituted analytic for synthetic self-consciousness, big S for little s [in "S/self- consciousness"]. (2) Opposition between extension and thought, matter and mind. [41] Thus for Descartes there became 3 spheres and 2 oppositions: /The\ opposition /^The\ opposition of /^ The \. Í Physical j of Í Psychical J Medieval f Logical J \Facts J Descartes V Facts J period V Facts J 496</page><page sequence="18">- [Regarding the Medieval opposition:] Thus Aquinas tried to con- H ceive of [the] opposition by making the human individual as connect- n ing two worlds (physical and logical). &lt; - Both antitheses were problems of Descartes. E"* Descartes and Leibniz tried to overcome the dualism or opposition 5" of [the] Medieval period by the new scientific method (Algebra, Math- o ematics) which dealt with the physical facts: [they] tried to reduce all ^ systematic thought to the mathematical equation (for Descartes the fT psychical disappeared in perfect logical knowledge). 5* Hume seemed to knock the bottom out of a priori science (mathe- g- matics, physical sciences, etc.). Kant rescued these sciences by making g' space and time the forms of human sensibility, hence by the analysis of ^ experience we find these forms. 5f Descartes and Leibniz tried to get the mundus intelligibus, but by a g wrong method. Kant saw that the psychical element could not be got- * ten rid of as simply vague and indistinct realities which would disap- ¿3? pear in a clear and distinct logical analysis. Kant made space and time O purely phenomenal, and the real noumenal and unknowable. [42] 2 Locke thought of a substance in which the attributes inhered. &lt;t&gt; Berkeley analyzed this substance and decided that there is no sub- jE stance outside of [the] psychical, and so posits a psychic substance Er (God) retaining also the idea of causation [as] the link between God 3 and us. 2 Hume knocks out the underpinning of a psychic substance and of ^ causation and gives us a mere phenomenal series, with a denial of the possibility of any a priori science. - Kant restores the possibility and validity oí a priori science by mak- w ing space and time the forms in which experience comes to us, and cau- 5 sation and substance the forms in which a noumenal self constitute this c/&gt; experience. U Descartes (following the conceptualists) takes the psychical element £ of "Cogito, ergo sum" as the starting ground, with the criteria of dis- £ tinctness and clearness, and taking the scholastic logical schemata, &amp; regards the psychical element only as indistinct and vague reality, the p true reality being the logical world (expressed in a mathematical equa- tion). Spinoza makes extension and thought as two expressions of [a] net Reality (= God). The error of Spinoza was in making the logical and the physical world particulars, instead of the psychical and physical, which he was really after. Leibniz identifies the objective world with the reason of the indi- vidual and took the relationship of sense perception and concepts as the basis: Spinoza's parallelism. The percept tends to pass into the concept as it becomes clear. For Leibniz, the phenomenal is what is known in perception and the noumenal or real is what is known in [the] ,„</page><page sequence="19">ro conception. Each monad has the whole world reflected in itself: each &lt;u monad has a universal content. g Kant retains the psychical as phenomenal and the logical as the d noumenal. With Kant each individual experience has a universal form. Z (Kant being the formal phenomenalism Leibniz being the phenomenal- ^ ist of content.) &lt;u [43] Why hadn't the psychical element as content [been] recognized £ on the continent, but only in England? On the continent, instead of "7&lt; pursuing the psychical content as such, we have the study of psychology £&gt; within the study of psychical processes which answer to the logical fact ^ as the basis of metaphysical theory (forecast in Abelard s statement of (7- conceptualism). The concept is regarded as the percept become clear ^ and distinct: the real is the conceptualized or logical reality, not the real- ,_, ity of sense perception or the merely phenomenal. On the continent, f-H the psychological method is employed with the recognition of the psy- QJ chical element as the essence of reality. &lt;^ Leibniz's pre-established harmony was more than just setting two co clocks [to] ring and having them strike together. His idea was that the Z universe of one monad was identical in content with the universe of &lt;J another monad, without their being functionally related to each other P^ (only to one Great Central Monad = God). The modern view makes H the monads (individuals) to have not only identity of content, but makes them functionally [like] each other. Since we all develop within the whole, according to Leibniz our developments run parallel; this is the meaning of his pre-established harmony. [44] For Leibniz, the differences between individuals (monads) [was that] one differs in completeness of realization of [the] universal (monad). Thus logically, completeness meant disappearance of the individual as such, lost in the universal monad. It is with this problem that Kant first struggles, until through Hume he is led to the critical philosophy of two worlds (a phenomenal [one] and a noumenal [one]). In England we find the analysis of [the] universal into certain con- crete facts of experience. The interest is in the psychical element. The points of difference are emphasized, abstracted. On the continent we find the process of passing from the individual fact of experience to the universal. The interest is in the universal. The points of likeness are emphasized, abstracted. But in neither case was it the full experience that was considered, though each assumed to represent the full facts of experience. If Spinoza had carried out his parallelism of the psychical and the physical consistently, he would have carried both back to the thought process [the] same way as the Post-Kantian Idealists did. He was the prophet of German post-Kantian Idealism as Leibniz was of Kantian philosophy. [45] With Leibniz it is not a question of [the] physical and ,„ [the] psychical as functional elements in the process of knowledge or</page><page sequence="20">thought itself (Spinoza), but of [the] relationship of [the] thought (uni- H versal) element to the psychical (individual) element, and the attempt a to resolve the vague psychical element into the clear and distinct 51 thought element, the imperfect monad to the perfect monad. The JT question is how can the individual psyche get to the universal thought, 5' truth, [or] Reality? Which value has the universal stated in terms of o individual consciousness? This corresponds to the religious technique ^ of R.C. Church, by which the individual was supposed to be able to n&gt; reach that perfect and ecstatic state by communion with the Divine. 2? There are then at this period two problems, or oppositions: (1) the g- psychical/physical opposition - the problem of parallelism, etc., (2) the £ psychical/logical (or thought) opposition. On the continent, the inter- ^ est is in the psychical not as content, but as method. On the island g* (England), it is the analysis of [the] psychical element (its content) g which becomes itself the end. We see the influence of these two modes ^ of procedure - the deductive, continental, a prioristic, rational, dog- ^ matic [method] and the inductive, English, empirical, sensational, O skeptical - in modern scientific thought. Modern scientific thought g starts out with given unanalyzed universals of ordered experience, &lt;t&gt; examines and experimentally reconstructs these [46] and passes to new £ universals. The old universal is recognized as insufficient, but is restated cr in the light of newly or freshly analyzed facts. The deductive process is 2 not interested in the individual as individual: the inductive process is S interested in the individual or psychical as such. g^ If you want to apply a general (for example, mechanical) formula, then you want to be able to have that application made by any individ- - ual (for example, [an] artisan). If you want to discover something then w the individual counts for everything: cf. the difference between the 5 American and English engineers. The American observes 101 things or&gt; that he was not sent to do; [this makes] all the difference between a q Newton and any ordinary observer. The difference between the ordi- £ nary experience and scientifically organized experience is one that £ makes use of the individual. * This is a continental method: mathematical theory. In the mathe- § matical or mechanical or exact sciences, the stage of observation is quickly passed and the bulk of attention is given to the theoretical side of method. In the biological sciences (including psychology) or the descriptive sciences, the chief aim is further observation of facts, and method is studied only for the end, in the form of controls, checks, etc. This is the method of English thought: description from observation. [47] The relation of subject and object never arises except when some difficulty arises, and such a difficulty always arises at a particular point. Experience when it runs smoothly remains below, or above, this dis- tinction. Psychology is not concerned with the subjective side of such a distinction, but with what is peculiar in experience to the individual: ,_</page><page sequence="21">co that is, psychology is the science of experience from the standpoint of &lt;u [the] individual (organism) as a focus of that experience. You can't *g think of subjective and objective as representing two coexisting series of 3 phenomena, but they are successive. The subjective is individual in the Z sense of "particular," but when the difficulty is overcome, experience 3} returns again or advances forward to the universal (perhaps a new uni- (u versal) which is objective. When you're going up the mountain, the 6 whole mountain is one to you (objective), but when you come to a - chasm, this becomes subjective for the nonce and the mountain £&gt; recedes: but accomplish this passage and the chasm takes its place in the ¡~ general background (objective) of the mountain again. The particular ►^ present and here is subjective and the general universal, remote and ^ past, is objective. It is this bit of subjectivity which can be made objec- _ tive which is the datum of psychology. [48] The conception that psy- f-H chology is concerned with a fixed subjective world into which we fall QJ when we are babies, and from which we passed by a laborious educa- &lt;J tion to the construction of an objective world, and back into which we c/D reconstruct ourselves by a psychological analysis, is a great error. The Z method of observation was developed in England and the method or &lt;3 process of forming the hypothesis was developed on the continent. The Ph thought of England developed the concept by generalizing from f- ' observed facts {a posteriori method); the thought on the continent developed the hypothesis for general forms {a priori method). The psychical world is not merely the objective world finding a completion through the physical, but represents only the generalization of that which gives rise to the psychical element. Two problems present themselves in connection with the conception of the psychical element: (1) that which allies itself with the idea of [the] "personal equation"; that which distinguishes individuals: how to refer to the so-called "reac- tion" differences between individuals. This first became the scientific import in the science of astronomy, whose different observers recorded different times of the passage of a star across the line, etc. Grew out of German physiology, etc. (This Mead calls Psycho-Physics.) (2) that which grows out of [the] social relations of man: turning upon the dif- ferences in estimate or valuation which different individuals give the same thing (identical object). The social meaning of the differences of evaluation is found in the readjustments of social relations. It was in connection with this type of problem that English psychology was developed. [49] All problems (even physical and chemical) first present themselves as psychical elements, but since this is not the end in itself, this [is] simply a starting-point, from which in a sense the subsequent progress of science receded further and further away. The difference between the mental and the mathematical sciences is this: simply in the former the psychical element is itself made permanently the end. The -nn fact is that no problem presents itself anywhere in any scientific proce-</page><page sequence="22">dure except, in the first instance, as [the] psychical element. All progress H is organized from myself as a center; the meaning of my life is found "&gt; and extended in the object itself. The emotion is mine, but the content &lt;? is in the object: we put the emotion, value, meaning, so to speak, in the £T object. This psychical element is not something that is a whole world 5' (subjective) answering to another world (objective). ^ It is that psychical element from which we start in our reconstruc- ^ tion. . . . We follow Descartes in this. Our psychical element does not n&gt; so much give us a new content as a new, fresh, individual, particular, 5? applied statement of [the] problem. The psychologist has to make the g- individual, particular subjective [thing] objective in order to study it, g just as the histologist has to kill the animal tissue to study it. [50] ^ Descartes started with the psychical element, but never came back to it. g~ Our modern method continually returns to [the] psychical element, g reconstructs that element and the rest of experience in the light of that " element, whatever it in the particular instance (problem) may be. xf Descartes' method may be likened to a cross-section (static) of our O method (dynamic - continuous reconstruction). Leibniz made an g advance over Descartes' dogmatic formal schematism in that in him n&gt; implicitly we find the method developed by which the psychical ele- £ ment was to be worked out. £r The psychology of feeling is essential to a social psychology, as well 14 as [to] the psychology of cognition. If one makes a statement of dis- 2 tinctions in the activity of psychology (cf. means and ends), the psy- g^ chology of teleology or "objective" or centrifugal feelings or of activity, experience belongs under ethics in the broad sense. Social psychology ^ deals in the impulses and their emotional accompaniments. Individual w psychology deals with sensations and centripetal feelings. Ethics deals g in the activity and experience of [the] whole (individual-social) self. &lt;s&gt; The primitive formula is always in terms of impulse: "I want to do q so and so." [51] Reality is a Unity in Diversity in which each individual £ is only one point of organization. The psychical element is not to be £ conceived as a particular series of realities, but as this same whole which &amp; at these focal points appears. The universality of our psychological tech- § nique does not imply that it may be applied everywhere, and that because it does not, therefore we may take the skeptical attitude toward all knowledge and experience. The individual differences do not destroy the value or validity of my consciousness or the universality of technique of this consciousness. My "means" are my hypotheses (sub- jective), until I have made it accord with the social (objective) con- sciousness: then it becomes objectively valid. You cannot have an individual psychology and a social psychology. They are one. Ditto for individual (psychological) and social ethics. You can't have a social psy- chology which shall [52] deal with a separate part of our nature. Like mental/mathematical-scientific, psychological/social, individual/social .</page><page sequence="23">co psychology, which differ only in point of view. The end is not always &lt;u social. The means is not only always individual. Individual psychology -g treats the individual simply as a functional whole; social psychology d treats the individual as a function within a larger whole. Z Descartes and Spinoza as much as Leibniz in some ways . . . [text 3 lost] &lt;u Wolff developed what was implicit in Leibniz: a formulation of £ essentially Leibnizian principles of empirical and rational psychologies. - His empirical psychology was an attempt to employ the a posteriori í&gt; method, inductive method. His rational psychology (metaphysical psy- ^ chology) employed the a priori or deductive method; [this was] an ►7- attempt to deduce from the supposedly] known nature of the soul its ^ essential elements and attributes. Discussion of doctrine of substance of HH [the] individual, soul, etc. Wolff's whole procedure was formal to the f-H last degree. It is from him that we have the so-called "faculty" psychol- QJ ogy. [This is] the setting up as a series of independent powers of mind &lt;J these various class names, and then regarding your psychological expla- c/D nation as complete when you have reduced your mental phenomena to Z these faculties. It is cheap, easy [53] play, [it is] superficial. [It is] found &lt;J in much of our modern psychologizing. Much of [the] psychological P^ terminology of German thought today came from Wolff ("Psychology" H (made it current), "Vorstellung," "Bewusstsein"). Kant maintained that a science of psychology was essentially impossible. He reacted against the formal dogmatism of Wolff. Yet when you remember the Critique of Pure Reason that contention strikes you as a bit amusing: for this, his own work, treats of just this, an analysis of experience. Kant means that what was conceived as a science of [the] soul simply is impossible and his idea of a true science was (1) one capable of mathematical formula- tion and cannot be done with [a] consciousness which has only one dimension, namely the time dimension, and (2) a true science must employ experimentation, and you cannot experiment with conscious- ness. Both of his statements have proved to be untrue. Herbart (1824) continues the tradition of [the] previous century insofar as he represents, like Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, some- thing of [the] universal philosopher. His chief fame is for his pedagogi- cal work. As a psychologist, he started from the definitely organized attempt to overturn the "faculty" psychology. Herbart had an eminent sense for the value of fact, a posteriori procedure, rich in introspective data; yet he contends distinctly from the establishment of psychology in part upon a metaphysical basis, and in practice he utilizes meta- physics even more than he does in theory. "Psychology based upon Experimentation, Mathematics and Metaphysics" [is a] vigorous and successful criticism of "faculty" psychology. [54] He would reduce all psychological processes to the interaction of ideas upon each other, fur- -09 therances and inhibitions of ideas upon each other. Conceived of these</page><page sequence="24">ideas as in a certain sense entities or processes or forces, each struggling H to get above a threshold of consciousness - a state of tension, stress. All n the other phenomena [are] like desire, feeling will = simply expressions &lt; or consequences of these relations of tension between ideas. Complete £f disagreement = pain. Complete agreement between ideas = pleasure. 5' [Herbart] introduced mathematical considerations into psychology. o A "static" and a "dynamic" of mind. Firstly introduced mathematics ^ into the statement of psychological processes, but not in a useful way. n&gt; [This was] purely symbolic, however, granted his premises. The nega- % tive value of Herbartian psychology [was] its chief value in overturning g- the "faculty" psychology and another step along the path of differenti- £* ating psychology from the other philosophical disciplines. w The mathematicians intended [to] replace particularly static ele- 2~ ments - lines, sides, planes (the geometry of the ancients) now [with] g the moving point or the moving line (modern algebra), the theoretical * unit, side of [the] polygon (in circle), e.g., is reduced to a negligible ^ quantity. So Algebra represents the method of procedure for the geo- O metrical method which deals with the resultants only as motion to a g formula which gives you, practically, motion itself. n&gt; [55] Spinoza, though living after Descartes (and at the time of Leib- jE niz), still employed essentially the old geometrical method in the state- £r ment of his philosophical system. The statement of the world in 3 universal form had always been in terms of [the] fixed object, resultants 2 of activities. With the emergence of [the] psychical element, the world g- becomes stated in terms of activity of these objects. They serve as stim- uli for the development of other objects [which would] become stated ^ in terms of motion or activity. The newer mathematics grows out of a w criticism, interpretation and reconstruction [of the] old geometrical 5 method, attention to technique itself, and an attempt to control it. The c/&gt; development of an elaborate technique of art and industry is of compar- q atively recent date. The man had to learn by serving an apprenticeship. £ There was little or no ideal grasp of [the] application of theory (tech- £ nique) as in our schools of technology. The meaning of this whole move- * ment is one of getting inside of our actual activities, with the result of § [the] emergence of [the] psychical element (that which is peculiar to the individual). It is [to this point] that all advance in method has evolved and it is in a study of this psychical (individual) element and method that all improvement in technique is to be achieved. [56] Some new means of stating the process of action (in art, artisanship, riding a wheel), of any sort, is the way the psychical element has come to light historically. Cf. inventions. Where the object is fixed as in the ancient world, invention and discovery are ruled out ab initio. But when, by reflection the method of experience is [used], growth, the use of objects, and dynamic relationships come to consciousness (the psychical ele- ment) a technique is developed by which invention and discovery</page><page sequence="25">ro (scientific advance on the practical, as opposed to the merely theoretical &lt;u side) becomes possible. "2 [An example:] When the end or purpose of [the] chair comes to d light - its purpose for the sitting-down activity - then the possibility of Z inventions and production of all manner of chairs for [a] great number ^ of ends is made possible. But so long as the end to be served is not &lt;u brought to consciousness in the minds of makers of chairs (as in the £ ancient world) such further adaptation is not possible. Cf. buildings, -g architecture, cf ancient temple with mediaeval cathedral, etc. Cf. the í&gt; factors that the modern architect has to taken into consideration in the ^ erecting of a Chicago "sky-scraper" (ground had become so expensive, ^ that [he] wants to use space as far up as [he] can). For further adaptation ^ it is necessary, moreover, for the maker of chairs to see further than the ,_ immediate use or end of [the] chair. He must see how the use expresses f-H itself in the resistance [57] of material, etc., etc. He must apperceive this {J particular use or end in a great realm of uses - relations or meanings (the &lt;J conception of mobility, flexibility, malleability, cohesion, permeability, co resistance, etc., etc.). It is the way in which the individual reacts on the ^ material - his disposal that contains the psychical element, which &lt;¡ [when] brought to light and criticized, interpreted and reconstructed, P¿ gives the technique for further adaptation. It is the way in which the H individual arrives at a universal (concept), brought to light as in English (applied) psychology, that gives us the psychological technique. Kant lodges [the] method, meaning [in the] world in the individual as such. He, in this respect, sums up two movements: (1) the one in which the individual is attempting to pass over to a new universal (English thought), and (2) the one in which the individual is trying . . . in the old universal). Kant's contribution to the development of psy- chological technique was [found] in insisting that the individual must state the world in terms of the way in which he constructs it; so that he can construct and reconstruct his world - not, as in the ancients and scholastics, in terms merely of [the] resultants, but in terms of [the] process of thought itself. [58] Previous to this time reflection had not gotten inside the psychical process involved in a reaction of organi- zation on a situation (stimulus). When the recognition of the devel- opment of [the] psychical element, the method, its development, psychological (scientific) technique began. The naive consciousness is restricted to the intelligent act as a reaction upon a fixed object; but it never gets at the process of this reaction. The savage can estimate the weight and balance, etc. of [the] boomerang, spear, etc. in terms of fixed objects of resultants of motion; but he never gets at (e.g., psycho- logically) [the] kinesthetic sources involved (does not get at the psychi- cal element and process, or technique of his own act). Two trains [are] moving before you. You wish to measure the com- -Q. parative speed [s]. You fix an object and really measure the velocity in</page><page sequence="26">terms of eye movement; but this as [the] psychical element does not H emerge for the savage or Greco-roman civilization. A technique of such n an estimating process is neither examined nor utilized?. . . . The motion &lt; or activity as process is always individual, psychical: the resultant of £T motion or action is always universal, objective or physical. Motion, 5' activity, has no lasting character - it lasts so long as it is in conscious- o ness (or rather, as consciousness is it). [The] final end object or result- ^ ant of motion is permanent and universal. [59] The only terms in ?f which motion could be stated was in terms of [the] individual psychi- Z? cal element, consciousness: the personal equation. There is no phase of g- our modern mathematical sciences (even physics) where the question of g' the personal equation does not enter, e.g. in all measurements by eye ^ and hand. But the personal equation did not enter into the old geo- 2T metrical method. England laid the greater emphasis upon the psychical g element. On the continent was developed the method [first for] utiliza- " tion of technique, secondly an analysis. . . . The problem is to get such ^ a universal statement of the resultant of [the] process or activity, that O you can determine it at any point in the process. 2 All our functional, quite developed, evolving sciences today produce « on the basis of algebraic equations. Each takes a resultant and then jJJ seeks a statement of process which will produce the result, and which or will include all the previous steps, and such a statement that it will 3 express the procedure (or evolution) taken at any point along the line of S progressive growth. Cf the algebraic statement of resultant of the g^ excursion of a moving point. 9 The psychical process implies the actual occurrence of society in the ^ individual even when [one has] particular or peculiar entities unlike w any other even (personal equation). [60] We have here a method of 5 dealing with actual occurrences as divulged from the resultants of such c/&gt; occurrences (individuals or psychical elements). q In all our experience we are using processes (organized activities) * which are not yet analyzed, for ex., in playing piano, riding a wheel, £ even in using a modern camera. But by the psychical technique which * we have developed we can [see] there only partially analyzed activities § as were formerly possible, [and] can foresee and predict and prevent uti- lization. That which you cannot analyze immediately (in your activity), you can indirectly or mediately utilize by a reconstruction of [the] dif- ferent steps in the process from [the] resultant on the lines of [the] tech- nique which an analysis of [the] psychical element has already developed: [you] can predict the future and reconstruct from [the] arts [of the] past. Psychology heretofore has been taking a psychic activity and stop- ping it at different points to see what you have got, cf Leibniz's similar analysis of [the] motion of [a] ball. The technique of psychology has been essentially that of the physical sciences. The concept of activity ---</page><page sequence="27">ro and motion, stream . . . had to be carried over bodily into psychology. &lt;u [61] The real line of division between the mathematical and mental sci- g enees' techniques it that the emphasis in the one case is on a static, fixed d object and on the resultant of motion; in the other case, on a dynamic Z relation and on the process of activity (motion). In this respect the ^ dynamic or energistic physics of modern times is under obligation to (u psychological technique. This is the real essence of any "comparative" 6 science. Cf also the development of sciences with [names containing a] -g hyphen (P-Psychology, P-Chemistry, Physical. . .). For once that knowl- ¡&gt; edge could be only an immediate resultant (no analysis of it as process) ^ knowledge simply "corresponds" to the object. For modern thought ^ there is [the] recognition of [the] process that lies behind ... it is bro- ^ ken off at its different stages, to get a statement of when we can get into )mmi the process of knowledge itself. In England, they were dealing with the f-H individual [that was] functionally valid in society. On the continent, QJ they were dealing with the individual by an analysis of [the] process of &lt;^ knowledge. In this emergence of the psychical element we have a gen- 00 eral attitude which is giving us the resultant to the process and in all ¡Zi these results [62] we have the attempt to get a statement of [the] result- &lt;J ant in such a form that it might be true of every step of the process = Pi the significance of functional - &gt; wholly developmental. f- ' In dealing with motion we are dealing with an immediate state of consciousness (and hence a consciousness of. . .). The recognition of [the] consciousness of [the] individual came later on the continent (as a result of method or technique) than in England when it was devel- oped in connection with social questions. In England, we have the psy- chical element as content; on the continent (Kant, Hegel), we have the interest [in the] psychical element as process (functionally). Kant's recognition of the individual was not a psychological, but an epistemo- logical recognition that differed in this respect from that in England. In Hegel, we have the statement of [the] thought product in terms of process, which may be applied at any point in the process. Modern complete psychological method embraces both the content and [the] functional analysis. In English thought the functional conception is lacking; continental [63] thought (even in Hegel) lacked the content conception. The whole trend of modern psychology is to substitute functions for fixed elements (cf James, Baldwin, Dewey; with the English, Americans, and Wundt). Moderns who identify language-less cries with verbal cries must not confuse and identify [the] psychical (reflective) consciousness with all consciousness (Mead). This formulation explains all the apparent diffi- culties which arise from the fact that psychology deals with ....
