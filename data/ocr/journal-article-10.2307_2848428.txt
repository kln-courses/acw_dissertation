Honorius included in this final chapter of his literary history all that he thought his readers would care to know of his life and of the works he had composed to instruct students who lacked library facilities, and to guide the slow of intellect to a knowledge of the true life.' He would certainly have been astonished, and would probably have been somewhat shocked, had he known that his identity would be disputed centuries after he and his students had completed their earthly pilgrimage. There is general agreement, based on internal evidence, that Ilonorius was born at about 1090, and was engaged in writing and revising his books until about 1156. His scholarly activity thus fell in the fruitful period that ushered in the Renaissance of the twelfth century. His Christianized Platonism sprang from intimate acquaintance with the ideas of Augustine, John the Scot, and Anselm of Canterbury, but he was also well versed in other patristic, Carolingian, and contemporary writers, and in those pagan authors whose scientia laid the essential foundations for Christian sapientia. His revival of the encyclopaedic type of writing which had lapsed since the Carolingian Age, and his skill in resolving his students' problems by his own fresh methods of exposition, make his works an indispensable mirror of the intellectual life of his own locality, which he knew intimately, and to which he contributed vitally. Without the name 'Augustodunensis' the problem of identification would be relatively simple, for internal evidence and the manuscript tradition point to southern Germany. The name Honorius suggests an insular origin, since there is 1 De luminaribus ecclesiae, iv, 17, in Migne, Patrologia Latina (hereafter cited as PL), CIXXII, 232-234. The corpus of Honorius' writings includes a few other works, omitted from this record either because of their brevity, or because composed after De Lum. The best general study of Honorius is by Josef Endres, Honorius Augustodunensis; Beitrag zur Geschichte des geistigen Lebens im 12. Jahrhundert (Kempten, Munich, 1906), cited hereafter as Endres, Honorius. For the use of this important mono- graph, and of other works consulted in the preparation of this paper, I am indebted to the Harvard College Library. The account of Honorius in MI. Manitius (Geschichte der lateinischen Literatur des Mittelalters (Munich, 1931), iII, 363-376, is based chiefly oii that of Endres. 897</page><page sequence="2">398 Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus no reason to associate him with Italy, the other area where it was in current use at this period. However, the activity of insular monks in southern Germany accounts for its occurrence in this region, whether its bearer came from the British Isles himself, or adopted the name on joining an Irish monastery. The theory that Honorius lived in an Irish community in southern Germany has been widely adopted, though some scholars maintain that 'Augustodunum' can only refer to Autun. Since Haureau's identification of the Philosophia mundi, formerly at- tributed to Honorius, as the work of William of Conches, the epithet 'Augusto- dunensis' is the only reason for associating him with France. In the mediaeval portions of his historical works, his chief interest was in the Empire. He did not mention Burgundy, the French kings, or events in France after the breakdown of the Carolingian Empire. In his world chronicle, the Summa totius, he referred to the Crusade only as a bloody mass pilgrimage.2 He used south German sources for the period from Bede to 1121, when the independent part of the Summa totius begins, and in the earlier section, based on Bede, he inserted references to local saints of Regensburg and Wturzburg. In Chapter 25 of the first book of the Imago mundi he added a note on Regensburg to Isidore's account of German geography and there are references to German cities and personages in the historical portion of this work.3 A minor indication of his German locale is his description of the communion bread in the size and form of a denarius, with the image and name of the Lord impressed on it, 'since the image and name of the emperor are in- scribed on the denarius.'4 Over five hundred manuscripts contain one or more of Honorius' works; the majority of these are in the collections of Munich, Vienna, Graz, Prague, and the smaller Bavarian and Austrian libraries. Among the seventy manuscripts in Munich, at least nineteen come from Regensburg, and many others come from monasteries within its sphere of influence, such as Wtirzburg, Gaming, Melk, St Florian, Kremsmunster, Gottweig, and Windberg.5 The manuscript testimony in favor of southern Germany is supported by the use of the Speculum ecclesiae in German sermon collections of the twelfth century,f and by the extensive ex- cerpts from the Elucidarium, Imago mundi, and Gemma animae in the popular German Lucidarius, compiled between 1190 and 1195. The evidence pointing to Regensburg has been examined most thoroughly by Endres, with special reference to the dependence of the sculptured portal of the church of St Jacob on the icono- graphy of Honorius' Commentary on the Song of Songs. The use of Honorius' symbolism for this portal, however, is not in itself a final argument, for tmile 2 Summa totius, ed. R. Wilmanns, MGH SS, x, 130 f.

Honorius stated the reason for anonymous publication of his works in the preface to the Elucidarium: 'Moreover, I decided to conceal my name, for fear that destructive envy might bid its devotees scorn and neglect a useful work. May the reader, however, pray that it be recorded in heaven, and never be expunged from the book of life.'8 A contemporary attack on this deliber- ate anonymity affords further evidence of Honorius' German residence. Gilbert de la Porree, accusing him of heresy because of his theory of human deification after the Resurrection, referred to him as living somewhere in Germany, and added that whereas he would have become notorious by the official censure of the Church if he had published his heresies under his own name, his concealment of his identity would leave him unknown, and unpunished.9 Since, however, De luminaribus ecclesiae was one of Honorius' latest works, and the bibliographical record with which it closes was obviously intended to identify his literary output as a whole, an enigmatic name would have been out of place here. The theory that he meant the adjective as a clear reference to Re- gensburg seems to me more tenable than it has appeared to previous students of the question. Before I undertake to justify this view, however, it is necessary to examine some other theories. Autun is the only city for which the name Augustodunum is fully attested, though both Augsburg, Augusta Vindelicorum, and Augst, Augusta Rauraco- rum, have been suggested.'" Honorius himself used the adjective Augustodunensis in the account of Reticius of Autun which he copied from Jerome." The deriva- tion of the name and its application to Autun are described in the account of 7 Endres, 'Honorius Augustodunensis und sein Elucidarium,' IIistorisch-politische Bldtter fuir das katholische Deutschland, cxxx (1902), 157-163; Das St Jakobsportal in Regensburg und lonorius (Kempten, 1903); E. Male, L'Art religieux du xiiie Siecle en France (4th ed., Paris, 1919), passim. Mile suggests (p. 307, note 1) that there may have been a handbook for painters which embodied Honorius' iconography. On the other hand, J. Sauer, Symbolik des Kirchengebdudes und seiner Ausstattung in der Auffassung des Mittelalters (2nd ed., Freiburg, 1924), 385-388, concludes that Honorius reflected the symbolism current in his time, for which there is no single source. He accepted, however, Endres' ascription of the motives of the portal of St. Jacob to Honorius' Com. in cantica canticorum. 8 PL, cIxxii, 1110.

For the identification of this attack on Honorius, see Endres, llonorius, pp. 124-126; Manitius, in, 364, note 6. 10 In manuscripts of Rahewin, Gesta Friderici, iv, 3, the adjective Augustodunensis is used of Augs- burg; of. W. Wattenbach, Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen (6th ed., Berlin, 1894), ii, 258. Augustensis, however, was the usual form, and Honorius referred to the city as Augusta. Sauer, Symbolik, pp. 13f., points out that the outspoken attacks on simony in the Offendiculum would have prevented Honorius from being scholasticus under the simoniac Herimann, bishop of Augsburg from 1096 to 1133. The theory of Augst has met with too little support to need consideration here. 11 De Lum., i, 83, Col. 206, copied from Jerome, De viris illust., 83.</page><page sequence="4">400 Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus Caesar's visit to the city, in the Vita S Germani by Heiric of Auxerre, which was widely read in Honorius' time: Inque capud regni primatum sumere iussit; Celtica Roma dein voluit coepitque vocari Crevit amicitiae sensim per tempora robur; Urbs quoque provectum meritisque et nomine sumpsit 'Augustidunum' demum concepta vocari, 'Augusti montem' transfert quod Celtica lingua.'2 Johann von Kelle, though he ascribed Honorius' works to a number of other anonymous authors, a conclusion which, like those of some Homeric critics, will not stand the test of reading the books concerned, did a considerable service by investigating the actual currency of the name Augustodunum as applied to Au- tun. He found that it passed out of general use after the ninth century, though it occurs in a privilegium issued by Pope Paschal in 1116. He also pointed out that the school of Autun declined in importance after the tenth century, and that there is no evidence for the office of scholasticus there in Honorius' lifetime.'3 Camille Daux, in an appreciative but uncritical study of Honorius, clung like Male to the Burgundian theory.'4 Among others who argue that Honorius' name must have been derived from Autun, some, like Baeumker, place his early activity there, and assume that local opposition forced him to move to Germany. Baeum- ker thought that the theory of predestination in the Elucidarium and Inevitabile proved his French origin; here he overlooked the great influence of Anselm of Canterbury on Honorius' beliefs.'5 Other scholars hold that Honorius was a German who adopted his cognomen after a period of study in Burgundy. Dieter- ich, for example, on the basis of a note in the Cambridge manuscript of Imago mundi, argued that he was a canon of St Mary at Mainz, who was forced by im- perial anger at his support of papal supremacy in the Summa gloria to withdraw to Autun, where he stayed until the death of Henry V.'6 This theory rests on a statement inserted in only one of the many manuscripts of Imago mundi; it seems improbable that a scholar would have commemorated in his name a temporary sojourn in such an inconspicuous center of learning as Autun was at the time. The insular connotation of the name Honorius, the influence on Honorius' works of Anselm of Canterbury, and the phrasing of the prefatory letters in two manuscripts of the Speculum ecclesiae, 'the brothers of the Church at Canterbury greet Honorius,' led Endres to suggest that the original reading in De luminaribus 1 Vita S Germani, i, 3, lines 348-353, in MGM, PLAC, iII, 448; the scholion on line 353 explains that 'dunos' is the Celtic word for mountain. 13 'Untersuchungen tiber den nicht nachweisbaren Honorius Augustodunensis,' Wiener Sitzber., CLII (1905), ii, 1-27. 14 'Un Scholastique du xiij Siele trop oublie; Honore d'Autun.'

More recently a Benedictine scholar, Romuald Baurreiss, has taken up von Kelle's old suggestion of Honorius' English origin.'8 The occurrence in an English homi- letic work, written about 11925, of passages from the Elucidarium, and Honorius' intimate knowledge of the works of John the Scot and Anselm, convinced Bauer- reiss that Honorius composed the Elucidarium and the Sigillum in England.'9 He argued, with more conviction than Endres had shown, that 'Augustodunen- sis' referred to Canterbury. He accepted Endres' arguments for Regensburg as the scene of Honorius' later activities, and, like him, pointed out the biographical evidence of the prologues of the earlier works. The Elucidarium was written at the request of Honorius' fellow-students at Canterbury. The Sigillum sanctae Mariae is introduced by the thanks of the chapter to their teacher for this work, and their request for the Sigillum. The Inevitabile was composed in answer to a message asking for a clearer solution of the problem of free-will than that given in the Elucidarium. In the Speculum ecclesiae the brothers, here designated as the monks of Canterbury, communicated with him by letter, with a reference to his recent residence among them, which, as Baurreiss pointed out, suggests more than a mere visit. Baurreiss used these prologues to support his theory that Honorius was educated at Canterbury, under Anselm, and thus formed the close relations with that center which continued after his removal to Regensburg. This recon- struction of Honorius' career supplements that formulated by Endres.20 The combination of Canterbury and Regensburg meets the requirements of the case better than any other theory, though I feel somewhat skeptical concern- ing a literal interpretation of the prologues. Each is well contrived to set the scene for the work it introduces; the requests to Honorius and his replies are identical in style, and are very similar to the prologues of works in which the brothers do not figure. The prologues served to show the common authorship and the se- quence of successive treatises, and thus avoid the risk that anonymity would prevent their being recognized as one man's work. Though Bauerreiss has clearly demonstrated the role of Canterbury in Honorius' early life, I find this less con- vincing as the key to the 'Augustodunensis' enigma than the evidence in favor of 17 In Manuscripts Munich 7700 (saec. xii), and S Florian xi, 252 (saec. xii-xi); see Endres, St. Jacobsportal, pp. 13 f. 18 R.

Regensburg acquired many names in the course of its long and varied history, as an early Celtic settlement, a Roman colony, the residence of Bavarian kings and dukes in the early Middle Ages, and thereafter as an imperial city which happily combined political importance and commercial prosperity with the re- ligious and intellectual leadership of the Irish monks who founded the convent of Weih-St-Peter in 1075, and thus laid the foundations for the primacy of the greater monastery of St Jacob, in which their community was incorporated in 1090, over the other Benedictine houses of the district.2' In addition to variants of the famil iar Ratisbona and Regensburg, the names of the city include the formal designa- tion of the Roman colony as Colonia Tiberia Augusta, or Augusta Tiberii, Hierop- olis, Regensburgum Palatium Publicum (in a cartulary of Charles the Great, issued in 792), and Reginopolis, Konigstadt, and K6nigsberg.22 The Gesta Caroli Magni, composed in the thirteenth century on the basis of old local legends, de- scribes Charlemagne's victory over the heathen who attacked the Christian popu- lation of the city, and his dedication of a shrine to St Peter on the Hill of Victory, where the Irish Marianus was to found his convent of Weih-St-Peter.23 The Gesta begins with a variant of the 'four Romes,' which in Godfrey of Viterbo's version were Aachen, Arles, Milan, and Rome :24 'From ancient times there seem to have been four chief cities, enjoying identical freedom and autonomy, subject to no man's authority save that of the Pope and the Emperor. Of these the first is Rome, the second Treves, the third Cologne, and the fourth Regensburg.' With this evidence of the local pride which inserted Regensburg in the list of the 'four Romes,' and remembering that Weih-St-Peter was built on the traditional site of the imperial Hill of Victory, Heiric's explanation of Augustodunum as Augusti montem, the Celtic Rome, makes the name as appropriate for Regensburg as for Autun. The Celtic etymology was well known in Honorius' time, for Heiric's ex- planation of the name was repeated by Sigebert of Gembloux.25 The Vita S Ger- mapi must have been well known to a scholar with Honorius' interest in the Caro- lingian writers. As Endres points out, the name 'Venetidunensis' was coined for the church at Windberg, in the Regensburg district.26 I recently found by accident an instance of the use of the adjective 'Augustodunensis' for the original city of the seven hills. The title of a fourteenth century manuscript of Egidius Romanus is reported in the catalogue of the Breslau Library as 'Tractatus Egidii Augusto- 21 J.

The ruin of Regensburg and the complete destruction of Weih-St-Peter in 1552 during the Schmalkaldic Wars account for the lack of documentary evidence for the name, which would not in any case have been likely to gain wide currency as compared with the well established German Regensburg and Latin Ratisbona. The same disaster must have destroyed any records of Honorius' life which might otherwise have been preserved in the monastic archives. Honorius described himself as 'presbyter et scholasticus.' The content, tone, and style of his works constantly reflect his dedication to the professions of priest and teacher. Most of the manuscripts call him 'inclusus' or 'solitarius,' names which seem inconsistent with his lively interest in the world about him, and with his concern for the secular cares of his neighbors. But the Irish Bene- dictines made Regensburg a fruitful field for such activities as his. Marianus, who founded Weih-St-Peter, is described as a man well versed in both divine and human letters; he devoted much time to copying the Bible and patristic works for the use of widows and the poorer clergy.28 Among the many insular monks who settled in this area were men skilled in music, goldsmith's work, and other arts. Their activities created a congenial environment for one who, like Honorius, saw no conflict between the ascetic life of the soul and the aesthetic pleasures of the senses in the unity of a divinely created world. Honorius continued Marianus' scribal activities on behalf of the poorer clergy and pious laymen by the many works which he compiled for those who were eager for knowledge but lacked library facilities.29 'In loving consideration for such as these' he wrote, 'I have compiled a compendium sufficient for their needs on the journey to the fatherland of life.'30 These words illustrate his favorite pilgrim symbolism, and his desire to bring other men to full understanding of their earthly pilgrimage, and of its heavenly destination. A recent study of the inclusi in southern Germany shows that Honorius' interests were not inconsistent with the services expected of those who thus restricted their physical lives without the anchorite's rejection of all external contacts.3' This makes the lack of any indication of the time at which Honorius became an inclusus less significant than it would otherwise be. There is no evidence in his works of any such alteration in his interests as might have accompanied the change, but frequent references in 27 Ms Breslau I F 135, written in 1372; Die Handschriften der Staats- und Universitdts-Bibliothek Breslau (1939), i, 2, 142. 28 De beato Mariano Scoto (Acta SS Boll., Febr. ii, 365-372); G.

His first work, the Elucidarium,32 was an attempt at a more systematic treat- ment of theological questions than the Sententiae of the previous period had af- forded, as its subtitle, Dialogus de summa totius Christianae theologiae, indicates. His failure to achieve this systematization fully was due in part to his immatu- rity, and to the difficulties imposed by the wide range of questions which he at- tempted to answer. But a greater obstacle lay in the contrast between his talents as a compiler and expositor, and the genius of his successors, whose Summae met the needs of more learned readers than his fellow students.33 The dialogue form so popular in mediaeval textbooks is used throughout, and the pupil is given ample opportunity to express his opinions. The preface illustrates his habitual use of rhymed prose, a style which was eminently suited to the cadences of mediaeval Latin. It closes with a general classification of his sources, and a typical metaphor; 'Fundamentum igitur opusculi supra petram, id est Christum, iaciatur, et tota machina quatuor firmis columnis fulciatur. Primam columnam erigat prophetica auctoritas, secundam stabiliat apostolica dignitas; tertiam ro- boret expositorum sagacitas; quartam figat magistrorum solers sublimitas.'34 Honorius described the three books of the Elucidarium as dealing with Christ, the Church, and the future life. Book I surveys the work of God from the begin- ning of time, with Christ as its culmination; Book II, man's life in the created world, and III, the union of God and man in the world to come. The first question, 'What is God?' is answered: 'So far as man may know, God is spiritual substance, of such inestimable beauty and of such ineffable sweetness that the angels, whose beauty is sevenfold greater than that of the sun, are never sated in their constant yearning to look upon him.' This leads to an account of the angels, demons and man, and of the animals which were created because man would need them after the fall. The creation of flies and other insects noxious to man is accounted for by the statement: 'All things are good, and were created for the sake of man.'35 A discussion of the Eucharist as the link between Christ and the Church provides the transition to the second book.36 Here the initial topic is the origin of evil, leading to the question, 'What is free will?' and the Augustinian answer: 'Freedom of choice between good and evil. This man possessed free in paradise, but now he has it under bond, for he does not 32 PL., CLXXII, 1109-1176: on the more extensive text in the thirteenth century MS Vienna 1763, see M.

The major significance of this portion of the Elucidarium for the modern student lies in his discussion of contemporary prob- lems. He was convinced that baptized infants would not suffer any spiritual loss on account of illegitimacy, for the sins of the parents cannot invalidate the sacra- ment. He made it clear that neither high office in the Church nor the priesthood gave any assurance of salvation unless justified by worthy lives. He compared priests who taught well but lived badly to a candle which gives light to others but consumes itself in the act. Monks who failed to keep their vows were the most wretched of men, 'because they have neither the world, nor God.'38 Those who make a public show of almsgiving and penance without giving up their sins gain nothing by it, though good deeds, even when done by evil men, will have their due reward here or hereafter.39 The passage on pilgrimage, if taken literally by Honorius' readers, would have greatly reduced the traffic on the pilgrimage roads: Do men profit by going to Jerusalem, or by visiting other holy places? It is better to give the poor the money such journeys cost. But men who are inspired by the love of Christ, who confess their sins, and then set out with money acquired by inheritance or by their own labor, and commend themselves by their prayers among the congregations of the saints along the way, are worthy of praise, even as Helena and Eudoxia are praised for their pilgrimages. Those, however, who make tours to the holy places out of idle curiosity, or for the praise of men, have their reward in the sight of beautiful scenery and handsome build- ings, and in the sound of the praise they love. But any who set forth with funds gained by profiteering, fraud, rapine or oppression, will receive the same welcome from God and the saints as a man who kills a son in his father's presence, and comes before him with blood stained hands.40 The same abhorrence of good works performed for unworthy motives appears in the famous 'Siren Sermon' in the Speculum ecclesiae, with the siren song of Avarice: "You must gather great wealth, so that you can spread abroad the glory of your name, and visit the Holy Sepulchre and other places, restore churches, and aid the poor and your kinsmen,' and of Vain Glory: 'You must go to Jeru- salem, and give much to charitable causes. Thus shall you become famous, and be called good by all men.'4' Truly devout pilgrims, however, were included among those for whom the congregation was to offer prayers.42 Like Luther, Honorius believed that good men will do good works, and though he considered teaching a higher function of the clergy than building,43 he listed contributions for church decoration and restoration among salutary charities for rich laymen, 37 II, 1135. 38 II, 1139, 1146, 1148. 39 ii, 1149-1151. 40 II, 1152; Cf.

Few soldiers are good; merchants make all their profits by fraud and perjury (Honorius does not specifically mention usury), and their good deeds are performed merely to gain God's protection for their wealth. Ioculatores are the ministers of Satan, but farmers are generally saved, 'since they live simply and feed the.Lord's people by their toil.'45 However, in the Sermo generalis, he shows less pessimism about the effects of different callings on men's souls. Soldiers are here described as the right arm of the Church. Merchants, after a warning against sharp practice, are told that since they minister to all nations, braving the perils of rivers, brigands, highways and deserts to bring them the necessities of life, all peoples are their debtors, and should pray for them. The farmers are his brothers and companions, but they are warned to obey the priests, not to exceed the boundaries of their fields, nor to cut hay or wood out- side the permitted limits, and to pay their tithes faithfully.46 The third book is a typical mediaeval description of paradise. The descriptive passages are lyrical and highly pictorial, in keeping with contemporary repre- sentations of the Last Judgment and the saints in paradise. Here Honorius' love of light, color, and musical harmony had full play.47 He describes the bodies of the just as immortal, incorruptible, and translucent as gleaming glass; all deform- ities will disappear, but the blessed will be resurrected with the age and stature at which they died. Their nude bodies will be clothed with colors, like those of flowers. They will be endowed with all the noblest characteristics of the famous men of antiquity, but to an infinitely greater degree; the ample power of Alex- ander would be to them a close confinement, and the liberty of Augustus mere captivity.48 In his first and most comprehensive work, Honorius thus sketched the human pilgrimage from the creation and fall of man to his resurrection. The Elucidarium was more popular than any of his other works except the Imago mundi; there are at least fifty manuscripts, of which ten date from the twelfth century, and it was, as we have seen, a major source of the popular German Lucidarius, in which por- tions of the Imago mundi and the Gemma animae were also used. It was translated into many vernacular languages, and was frequently excerpted.49 Though it 44 Spec. eccl., col. 864. 45 Eluc. ii, 1148 f. 46 Spec. eccl., cols. 865 f. 47 See E.

Meyer, Romania, viii (1879), 3925ff., as one of the popular books, written for the wives of Anglo-Norman lords.

Honorius' next work, the Sigillum sanctae Mariae,50 was composed to provide an explanation of the apparently irrelevant lections for the feast of the Assump- tion. He first summarized Anselm's ninth homily to explain the application to the Virgin of the Gospel story of Mary and Martha, and of the passage from Ecclesiastes which forms the epistle for the day.51 The interpretation of the Song of Songs in terms of the Virgin, which composes the remainder of the Sigillum, is his original contribution. From the tenth century i'ncreasing faith in the Virgin's powers of intercession caused mainy German churches to be dedicated in her honor, and the legends of Mary were widely circulated here before the cult be- came popular in other countries.52 Hence it was natural for Honorius and Rupert of Deutz to initiate in Germany this interpretation of the Song of Songs, which Bernard of Clairvaux, Alanus and others were to make famous later. The Sigillum, like Rupert's commentary, was intended for the clergy. More than twenty manu- scripts show that it was read in southern Germany, Austria, and Bohemia through the fifteenth century. The sermons on the four feasts of Mary, in the Speculum ecclesiae, written for a more popular audience, were also widely disseminated. They were sometimes copied separately, and in some manuscripts are appended to the Sigillum. The Sigillum illustrates the relation of the inner and outer man, and of the members of the Church on earth and in heaven, through the bond furnished by the Virgin as the type of the Church. This early study of the Song of Songs contributed significantly to the descriptions of the works of nature and of man in Honorius' later writings. Some years later, Honorius composed a commentary on the Psalter.53 The im- portance of the psalms in the daily offices led many abbots to compile commen- taries to give the monks a clearer understanding of their substance and its prac- tical application :54 Abbot Christian of Regensburg delegated this task to Hono- rius, who followed the traditional interpretations of Augustine, Cassiodorus and Remigius. In spite of his disclaimer of originality, he added considerable inde- pendent material. Writing, as he said, for the unlearned, he began his work with an accessus, in which he classified the Psalter under the heading of logic, and ex- plained its titulus, its intentio - 'to urge us to imitate Christ's pattern' '-, its materia -'Christ in the Church' -, its utilitas - 'to know how to shun vice and do good deeds' -, and its finalis causa - 'the gaining of eternal life.'55 He 50 PL, CLXXII, 495-518. 51 The summary is repeated in the sermon for the feast of the Assumption, Spec. eccl., cols. 991 f. 62 S.

His use of the dialectic method is illustrated by a passage derived from Cassiodorus, in the commentary on the first psalm, in which he describes syllogisms as concealed in the Scriptures, like fish under water, to be extracted for man's use.16 Since the Psalter was the first book of the Bible studied in the schools, Hono- rius explained the five methods of scriptural interpretation: historical, historical and allegorical combined, prophetic, literal, and allegorical, all of which he used repeatedly in this commentary and in that on the Song of Songs, with special emphasis on the allegorical method. In other works he gives the customary 'quadripartitus intellectus,' historical, allegorical, tropological or moral, and anagogical.57 Biblical exegesis afforded ample opportunity for the number symbolism of which Honorius was so fond.58 Three was the hallmark of the Psalter, as four was of the Song of Songs. The three groups of psalms typify the three ages of the world, 'one before the law, the second under the law, and the third under the grace of God.' The fifty psalms of each group symbolize the just men of their suc- cessive ages.59 The commentary on Psalm 103 (104 in the English numbering) is a lyric paraphrase and expansion of the psalmist's description of the wonders of creation, followed by an explanation of the allegories in the individual verses. Honorius' second commentary on the Song of Songs was one of the most com- prehensive studies of the book of the Bible which was more widely read at this period than any other except the Psalter.60 He dedicated it to Gregory, who suc- ceeded Christian as abbot of St Jacob in 1156. It was thus one of his latest works, and his pride in it is shown by the comment in his bibliographical record. It is fre- quently listed in mediaeval library catalogues, and over fifty manuscripts are preserved, including some illustrated copies which show a keen appreciation of its pictorial symbolism. Bede's interpretation of the Cantica in terms of Christ 56 Col. 279. Endres, Honorius, p. 94, falsely criticized Honorius for introducing the 'fantastic idea of the fish;' actually he caught the fish in Cassiodorus' preface (PL, Lxx, 21), and transferred it to this passage. 57 Col. 273; also Spec. eccl., col. 1102; Sacramentarium, cols. 748 f.; De animae exsilio, col. 1245; Com. in cant., cols. 349-359.

In the prologue, cols. 308-311, the three ages are subdivided into fifteen, with each decade of psalms typifying one period in the life of the Church, an arrangement original with Hono- rius.

For its carvings this commentary (as Endres, Das St Jakobsportal, showed) furnished the text; they were formerly attributed to John the Scot's De divisione naturae, one of the major influences on Honorius' allegorical concepts. As a companion-piece, Honorius copied Salonius' commentaries on Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, with the title, Quaestiones et in easdem respon- siones in duos Salomonis libros Proverbia et Ecclesiasten, in accordance with Jerome's statement that Proverbs was meant for the instruction of children, Ecclesiastes for young men, and the Song of Songs for mature readers, so that the three made a graded series.</page><page sequence="13">Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus 409 and the Church is extended by Honorius to include Christ in relation to the indi- vidual soul, his Godhead in relation to his manhood, and the union with God of all mankind, from the four quarters of the world and throughout its four ages, an interpretation which gave full scope to his love of allegory. The prologue begins with an extensive accessus, including many definitions irrelevant to the text, but presumably useful for the students' general informa- tion. A second prologue summarizes man's miseries after the fall, comparing the six ages of man, from infancy to decrepitude, with the ages of the world from Adam to the second coming of Christ. Number symbolism, comparisons of the Syna- gogue with the Church, and of knowledge with wisdom, the conflict of virtues and vices, and allegories from the bestiaries, with fantastic animals to typify the world, the flesh and the devil, and such good beasts as the chaste elephant for the virtues, are conspicuous elements in this commentary. The traditional parallelism between the Old and New Testaments is here transcended by the deeper symbolism of Christ's body, the Church, in all its human variety, for the material Church had become the symbol of the spiritual, and contemporary Christendom the mirror of the past and the hope of the life to come. A characteristic anagogical interpretation, based on John the Scot, contrasts the outer and the inner man: the human body is made up of the same four ele- ments which compose plants and trees, and shares the power of sensation with all living creatures. But the powers of the inner man; the inner sense by which we perceive the past, present, and future; reason, by which we discern the genera and species of things seen; and intellect, by which we know incorporeal things, such as love and wisdom, are peculiar to man, who in this respect is completely dis- tinct from animals.61 Man's identity with other creatures, and his distinction from them, were a favorite theme with Honorius. In the Cognitio vitae he wrote: 'This whole world is like a very minute point within God.'62 Man, made in God's image, is the micro- cosm, with chief rank in the earthly chain of being: The outer man, that is, the body, is formed on the model of the world, being compacted of the four elements, whence it is called the microcosm or lesser world. The soul is the image of God, ruling the lesser world, as he rules the greater. Every creature has some resem- blance to God, the greater in proportion to its superiority to a lower creature. He himself is, lives, feels and exercises the power of reason. Thus stones resemble him, in that they exist. Trees approach his likeness more closely, for they exist, grow, and live. All animals express his image much more closely, since they exist, live, and feel. The likeness of God is most resplendent in men and in angels, for they exist, live, feel, and exercise the faculty of reason.63 This ancient concept of man as microcosm, for which Isidore, Bede, Rhabanus, and John the Scot furnished the chief sources in mediaeval Europe,64 appears in 61 Col. 362, drawn from De div. nat. II, 28, 572. The three forms of vision are more fully discussed in Scala caeli, chs. 8-15, PL, CLXXII, 1232-1240. 62 PL, XL, 1020; Anselm's Monologium, on which the Cognitio vitae is based, has no parallel to the microcosm passage. 63 op. cit., 1023. 64 Direct sources in John the Scot for Honorius' microcosmic ideas are De div. nat., ii, 3-5; 13, 23;</page><page sequence="14">410 Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus the Elucidarium in the familiar analogy between the parts of the body and those of the visible world, the round head representing the heavenly sphere, the eyes the sun and moon, etc.65 This description provided the explanatory text for the picture of man as microcosm in the Hortus deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg.66 In the Imago mundi, the microcosm led to a comparison of the music of the seven planets with the four elements of the body and the three powers of the mind; another passage of the same work compared the activity of the four humors in the four ages of man and in the four seasons.67 A chapter in the Sacramentarium recapitulates the microcosmic theory, with the conclusion: 'All these points show that man is the lesser world; therefore the wheel of human nativity is fittingly compared to the temporal age.'68 Honorius' third work, the Inevitabile, was written for a delegation of the broth- ers, who demanded a solution of the problem of free will, which the Elucidarium, they said, had made more insoluble. Their spokesman maintained that the au- thorities Honorius had cited killed free will by the dead weight of predestination. We hear an echo of heated arguments among young theologians in the master's query: 'Why do you so detest the very word predestination?' He repeated the Augustinian definition given in the former discussion, and emphasized especially the distinction between man's innate freedom of judgment and the capacity for action, which is his only by God's grace.69 In answer to the question why, since men's deeds neither help nor harm God, they should not all receive the same treat- ment after death, he described the incredible beauty and variety of form, color, and function on earth and in heaven, using as illustrations the work of artists and goldsmiths, natural phenomena, the hierarchies of clerical and secular society, the diversities of language, customs, and laws among the nations of mankind, and the rainbow colors that will distinguish the several orders of the saints at the Last Judgment.70 Later, under the influence of Anselm's treatise on the topic, Honorius revised the Inevitabile, not changing his essential views, but putting more emphasis on free will.7' He now proposed as the most fitting definition of free will, 'the power of iII, 37; iv, 5, 10; and V, 5, the often quoted description of man as 'officina omnium.'

According to the opinion of a seventeenth century censor, the revision was free from the heretical tinge that marred the original. 72 The occurrence of the first version, together with the Elucidarium, Offendiculum, and De apostatks, in several manuscripts from a common archetype suggests that Ilonorius himself did not wish to suppress it. He returned to this important topic in a shorter trea- tise, De libero arbitrio, attacking the fatalism of frivolous men who used the doc- trine of predestination as an excuse for their misdeeds.73 In another brief work he gave this characteristic answer to the question why God does not destine all men to salvation, especially guiltless infants: Why he does not do so we can no more find out than we can discover why he did not make angels archangels and archangels thrones; why he did not make women men or ani- mals birds, or why he gave the peacock such lovely plumage, surpassing that of other birds, and many similar questions. 'For whatsoever he has willed, he has done, and does.'74 The Speculum ecclesiae, which follows the Inevitabile in Honorius' list, contrib- uted to the revival of parochial preaching in southern Germany,75 and must have been a useful instrument in the campaign of the Regensburg monks against the attempts of the secular clergy to monopolize this phase of the Christian ministry. In the latter part of Hartmann's bishopric, Kuno was the especial target of the secular clergy, who charged that as a monk, and therefore a dead man, he had no right to share in the deliberations of the diocese nor to preach.76 The place of the Speculum in the sequence of Honorius' works indicates that it was compiled at about the time of this incident, several years before Kuno became bishop of Re- gensburg in 1026. It afforded a rich variety of Latin sermons to be translated into the vernacular, together with the material for an ars predicandi.77 Honorius de- scribed his work as a new painting, modelled on those of the most skilled artists, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory.78 The continuance of the controversy between monks and other clergy during Kuno's bishopric led both Rupert of Deutz and Honorius to compose tracts asserting the right of ordained monks to 72 Approbatio of the Amsterdam censor (1690), PL, CLXXII, 1222.

The composition of the Speculum so early in Honorius' German residence suggests that his interest in preaching may have been a major factor in the growth of this activity in the Danu- bian area. If we may take the prefatory letters literally, he would seem to have been a pathfinder in this respect at Canterbury as well.</page><page sequence="16">412 Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus preach, and to perform all other priestly functions.79 It doubtless contributed to the antagonism of which Honorius so often complained, but which never pre- vented him from upholding a cause he considered good. Strangely enough, the three collections of sermons listed among his latest works, the Refectio mentium, the Pabulum vitae, and the Evangelia quae beatus Gregorius non exposuit, a supple- ment to Gregory's XL Homiliae in Evangelia, are the only items in Honorius' list which have not survived. The instructio loquendi prefixed to the first sermon in the Speculum, and numer- ous other passages, show a sound understanding of the art of preaching and of the human problems of a congregation. The text is to be given first in Latin, then in the vernacular. The preacher must speak humbly, without exaggerated gestures, but with due regard to the principles of rhetoric, suiting his voice to the subject, 'so that your hearers will think they actually see the events instead of hearing you.' The length of the sermon must be adjusted to the season, allowing for the effects of winter's cold and summer's heat on the staying powers of the congrega- tion. Sermons should not be delivered too often, lest they become tedious and commonplace. The preacher must adapt his discourse to the congregation; the sermons in the Speculum were suited to an urban group like the people of Regens- burg; for the 'vulgus' a simple exposition of the Gospel or Epistle was preferable.80 This assumption of an urban and fairly literate congregation accounts for refer- ences to the liberal arts, for occasional classical allusions, sometimes cited dis- paragingly, for the frequent combination of bits of ancient history with episodes from the Old and New Testaments, and for considerable use of number symbol- ism. More popular elements, well adapted to bourgeois taste, are the exempla, which Honorius rarely used in his other works, but handled effectively in the sermons, and allegories drawn from the bestiaries, which give an illuminating commentary on the iconography of the period, and its appeal to the lay imagina- tion.81 His love of light, color, and the infinite beauties of the natural world are as conspicuous here as in the Elucidarium; the sermon de paschali die echoes the lyric quality of Easter hymns and the Benedicite. Honorius was as conscious as any parish priest of the human frailties of a con- gregation. The Siren sermon, recommended for frequent use 'to take away weariness,' begins with the priest's promise to preach briefly: 'For some of you have come from afar, and will have a long journey home. Some may have guests at home, or wailing infants. Some of you are pressed for time, on the way to other business. Some are made restless by bodily infirmity, or are embarrassed by their 79 The tracts of Rupert, Utrum monachis liceat praedicare, and Honorius, Quod monachis liceat praedicare, are printed from the twelfth century Ms Munich 22, 225 (see note 5), in Endres, Honorius, pp. 145-150.

The same sound moderation is shown in a short tract, Utrum sit peccatum nubere vel carnes comedere,83 in which Honorius showed that both marriage and the eating of meat were sanctioned in the Bible; only their abuse was to be condemned in the case of laymen, who were not bound to abstinence by the special obligations of priests, monks and nuns. In this treatise, as in the Speculum and elsewhere, he assigned married people a worthy place in the Christian hierarchy. In accordance with this distinction between the obligations of different classes Honorius insisted on strict maintenance of their vows by the secular as well as the regular clergy. In answer to a request from the brothers for his decision on the much-disputed question whether priests might marry, and whether sacra- ments performed by married priests were valid, he composed, probably in 1122, the Offendiculum,84 a polemic against clerical marriage, which prepared the way for Kuno's campaign to bring the secular clergy of his diocese under canonical rule. Honorius contributed to this campaign also in a tract previously mentioned, Quod monachis liceat praedicare,85 a plea for canonical organization of the secular clergy, as the logical outcome of his conviction that the latter were as much bound to a life of chastity and of purely spiritual interests as the monks. Much of the hostility from which he suffered may be attributed to the opposition this aroused among the secular clergy. Since the Offendiculum is an expansion of Anselm, De presbyteris concubinariis seu offendiculum sacerdotum, it forms another link between Regensburg and Canterbury. The quotations from Horace and Vergil in the prefatory letters are schoolroom tags, such as are rarely found in Honorius' work. The treatise includes notable citations of the canon law, and an historical survey of the growth of Christian standards of clerical life from the primitive regulations of the Old Testament and of pagan cults. 'The chaos of the old law was the shadow cast by the light of the new law.'m Whereas in the Elucidarium Honorius had conceded the legality of masses performed by married priests - 'although they are utterly damned, yet the body of Christ is made by the words they utter'_,87 he now considered such men outside the church, and incapable of administering the sacraments. Baptism and burial, he said, were better performed by good laymen than by married priests. He also condemned the use of ecclesiastical offices for temporal gain, all types of simony and the ordination of ignorant men. He de- 82 Col. 855. In the sermo generalis col. 886, Honorius also listed the worthy and unworthy motives that bring people to church; the latter include plots against enemies, gossip with friends, the display of costly garments, and the desire to mock the word of God. 83 Dieterich, MGI, Libelli de lite, iII, 84 f. 84 Op. cit., pp. 88-57. 85 Cf.

He compared monks, as the highest class in the human scale, to the Seraphim as the highest angelic order; they were therefore the more to be condemned if they did not live up to their high calling. But those who entered monasteries to study be- cause of poverty and coercion were relatively guiltless if they withdrew without taking their final vows, and even professed monks might be pardoned for apostasy if they returned promptly. In the Liber XII quaestionum91 he told of acting as arbiter in a quarrel between a canon and a monk as to the respective status of their patrons, the Apostle Peter and the Archangel Michael. The treatise by which, at their request, he supplemented his brief oral verdict, describes the natures of men and of angels as distinct chords in the harmony of the universe, which cannot properly be com- pared. Man is more worthy, since man is God in Christ, whereas the angels are happier, in the beatitude which man can regain only by the constant exercise of virtue. Thus the local rivalry led to a discussion of man's creation as implicit in the original scheme of the universe, a Gregorian doctrine which Honorius shared with Rupert, Hlugh of St Victor, and Anselm, and which clearly shows the in- fluence of John the Scot, whereas William of Champeaux and others insisted that man was created by a divine afterthought to fill the gap left by the fallen angels. 92 Honorius' priestly interest in the liturgy is shown in the Gemma animae de divinis offlciis,93 a summa based on Isidore and Amalarius of MI-etz, with additions in the form of allegory, especially number symbolism, and references to current usage. The wide reputation of the Gemma in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is attested by its use in the German Lucidarius, the Augsburg ritual, the De principis instructione of the Welsh Giraldus, who adapted from it his account of church officials, Sicardus of Cremona's Mitrale, and the Rationale divinorum officiorum of Durandus of Mende, which finally superseded it as the essential handbook for the liturgy.

The great increase of interest in all matters connected with the Eucharist, stemming from the Berengarian controversy, doubtless contributed to the popularity of the Gemma. In his preface Honorius inveighed against those who preferred the fights of Hector, the dialogues of Plato, the poems of Maro, and even the trifles of Ovid to the study of the Christian religion. The treatise consists of four books, of which the first, on the Eucharist and the ministers of the Church, contains several points of interest for students of liturgy - for example, the account of the bishop's progress to the altar in chapters seven to nine, and that of the recent innovation of the denarius type of communion wafer in chapter thirty-five. Despite Honorius' usual abhorrence of the stage, he described the bishop's celebration of the Mass as the drama of the crucifixion presented by a tragic actor.94 The Eucharistic doctrine, which he was to expound more fully in the Eucharisticon, is briefly stated: 'Even as the world was made from nothing by the word of the Lord, so by the Lord's words this physical species is truly changed into the Lord's body - we see the species of bread and wine, we believe it to be the body and blood of Christ.'95 The significance of the various parts of the church was a topic of general in- terest at a time when so many churches were being built or enlarged and re- decorated. Of church painting he wrote: 'There are three reasons for paintings: first, because they are the layman's books; second, for the fair ornamentation of the building; and third, to preserve remembrance of the lives of good men.'96 The second and third books describe the canonical hours and the church calendar. In the latter the lessons for the months are related to periods of world history; the last four months of the year represent the empires of the Orient, Greece and Rome, with that of the Christians to be established at the end of the world.97 The fourth book interprets the chants, epistles and gospels for indi- vidual days, pointing out parallels between the Old and New Testaments, and relating them to Christian ethics. The same themes are briefly summarized for less educated readers in the Sacramentarium.98 The small number of manuscripts of this work, and the omis- sion of liturgical points from the sermons, suggest that only the more educated clergy were really interested in the liturgy. In this brief summary Honorius gives a brief exposition of the methods of scriptural interpretation, parallels between the days of creation and the ages of the world, and parallels between historical periods and the lessons appointed for different days.99 His allegorical use of un- natural history is illustrated by a comparison of the priest, with his seven vest- ments and seven virtues, to the panther's sevenfold coloring and the healing power of its breath.100 94 Gemma, i, 45, col. 557.

After defining the threefold character of the ele- ments, historical, sacramental, and symbolic, he states that the purpose of Christ's incarnation was the redemption of man by the Eucharist, and strongly affirms the doctrine of transubstantiation.102 Only priests within the Church can perform the sacrament; neither simony nor any vice, however reprehensible in itself, that does not debar a priest from office, can invalidate the sacrament he administers. The body of Christ is not affected by the character of those who partake of it, hence an animal can consumc only the species, not the body of Christ, and this is true also of men who receive the sacrament unworthily. Despite Honorius' adherence to the doctrine of transubstantiation, which was now well on its way to final acceptance as established dogma, the Eucharisti- con was one of his less popular works, and was even thought to be tainted with heresy.103 The clue to this apparent paradox may be found in his affirmation of John the Scot's doctrine that the Eucharist fulfilled the purpose of Christ's in- carnation for man's deification.104 This principle of human deification, which Honorius stated more explicitly elsewhere, inspired Gilbert's attack on him, as we have seen: it is most clearly enunciated in the Quaestiones VIII de angelo et homine: 'Now the purpose of Christ's incarnation was the foreordination of human deification, for from eternity it was foreordained by God that man should be deified.'105 The attention focussed on John the Scot by the Eucharistic controversy in- volved his name in charges of heresy long before the bull of Honorius III in 12925, and his works were circulated at this period chiefly among the Albigensians and other heretical sects.108 This did not deter Honorius from using his writings to extend his own more limited capacity for philosophical interpretation along lines thoroughly in keeping with his natural bent toward Realism, and with his con- viction of the dignity of the divine order of the universe, and of man's place in it. He also made full use of John's allegories.

John's concepts of the triune reality and the divine order and harmony of nature, with his analysis of the different stages of being, and of the transitions from corporeal to spiritual and from spiritual to divine, permeate Honorius' works, and led him, as we have seen, to embrace certain doctrines that seemed heretical to theologians of a different school.109 John's theory of knowledge de- termined the character of Honorius' discussion of many problems. His chief tribute to his master, however, was the reworking of the De divisione naturae in the Clavis physicae, one of his latest works, written, as he said, when he was no longer overburdened with other tasks. He seems to have undertaken it more as a labor of love than in the hope that it would be widely read. He stipulated at the outset that nothing should be written down, 'except what can be proved by sacred authority and the clear light of reason.' He therefore inserted a brief state- ment about the notable Hebrew, Greek, and Latin writers on whose authority the work rested, and whose sound doctrine was above suspicion. The Clavis physicae covers nearly half John's book; too little has been printed to make ex- tensive comment possible without access to the manuscripts, but Endres' presen- tation of parallel passages from the two works shows how closely Honorius fol- lowed John's thought and phrasing.110 He retained the dialogue form of presenta- tion, and like John gave the student a real share in the discussion, which enabled him to summarize passages of the original that he himself was not willing to sponsor. In one such instance, cited by Josef Bach in his detailed study of the Clavis physicae, the pupil's summary of a pantheistic theory is met by the master's warning: 'you will be accused of great heresy.'"11 In general, Honorius' version excludes openly pantheistic doctrines. Bach comments especially on his description of the body of Christ, with the two natures inseparably united, and free from all limitations of time and space, yet always preserving their distinct 107 PL, cLxxII, 197-284.

In the list of types of heresy he substituted for Isidore's class of those who believe men can be changed into demons and animals the more recent heresy of 'belief in a single operation and a single will of deity and humanity in Christ.'1"3 On one occasion Honorius took part in a controversy of major historical im- portance. Since the middle of the eleventh century the Investiture Conflict had inspired a mass of propaganda, which continued long after the partial settlement of 1122. Shortly after the Concordat, Honorius, probably at the request of Kuno, who was an ardent protagonist of the papal cause, made a notable contribution to this controversial literature in his Summa gloria.114 The eleven extant manuscripts show that it was circulated in southern Germany and Austria until the fifteenth century; Honorius' anticipation of the extreme papal theories of the fourteenth century probably contributed to its continued use. In the first chapter he ex- pounds the obvious precedence of spiritual over secular authority. The clergy are devoted to the speculative life, and the people to the 'negotiative.' As the spiritual regularly takes precedence over the secular, so the priesthood excels the royal power in honor. Since, however, ignorant men, blinded by secular knowledge, think nothing proved unless it is supported by scriptural authority, he traced the history of the question from the beginning of the world. His method excluded specific consideration of the recent conflict, and of the claims of the imperial party.1-5 The basic principle is the unity of Christendom, in which the priestly and royal elements should not function as rival institutions, but as complemen- tary parts of a single whole, with the spiritual authority in the ascendancy. The oppression of the priesthood by the secular power was prefigured by the murder of the shepherd Abel by Cain, the founder and ruler of the first city. After the Flood, the priestly line began with Shem, who is identified with Mel- chisedek; the Roman imperial power was inherited from Japhet, and Ham's de. scendants, Nimrod and Ninus, began the series of tyrants, hostile to both priests and kings.116 Jewish and pagan history illustrate the natural ascendancy of the clergy, which was revived in the priestly rule of the early Christians, and was reenforced by Pope Silvester's delegation of the temporal sword to Constantine, as his subordinate in the administration of church and empire as a single Chris- 112 Bach, op. cit., 302 f., on Clavis physicae, ch. 70. 113 This treatise, printed in PL, CLXXII, 233-240, is based with very slight changes on Isidore, Etym., viii, 3-6. It was compiled as a companion-piece for De luminaribus, contrasting the smoky gloom of heresy with the clear light of orthodoxy. 114 Dieterich, MGEI, Libelli de lite, iII, 63-80; also printed in PL, CLXXII, 1257-1270. Honorius' association with Anselm, a most stubborn opponent of lay investiture, made him a natural choice for this task. 115 Dempf, Sacrum Imperium (Munich, 1929) p. 239, censures this naive disregard of actual imperial rights, and thinks the schematic historical approach the only original element in the work. By con- trast, note the high estimates of R. W. and A. J. Carlyle, History of Mediaeval Political Theory, (Edinburgh, 1922), iv, 286-297, C. H.

This leads to an extreme statement, contradicted by actual practice: 'The Roman Emperor should be chosen by the Apostolic See, confirmed as head of the people by the consent of the princes and by popular acclamation, consecrated and crowned by the Pope. The clergy and people owe him obedience only in secular matters.'118 The Pope consequently has full power to depose the Emperor. Since God does not set men to rule over men, but only over beasts, the Emperor wields his sword only to subdue those who cannot be corrected by the priestly stole. The people owe their king obedience in his administration of justice, but may refuse to obey an unjust or heretical ruler, or one who rebels against the Apostolic See. They may not, however, rebel against such a ruler, but must en- dure him patiently, withdrawing from all communion with him."19 Thus Honorius stops short of the logical political implications of his extreme doctrine of papal supremacy. It is interesting to note that in his world history, the Summa totius, Honorius, following the Rosenfeld Annals, gave only a brief factual account of Henry IV's Italian wars, and his deposition and appointment of popes, with no allusion to the Investiture Conflict, and no censure of the emperor. His account of Henry V diverged somewhat from his sources, emphasizing the imperial attacks on Paschal and Gelasius, and giving a brief statement of the settlement of 1122, but there is no indication here of his own opinions.120 The surveys of human and natural history in the Summa totius de omnimoda historia and the Imago mundi show his interest in the created world more com- prehensively than the many scattered references in his other works. His convic- tion that the temporal world and its mortal creatures, though subordinate to things eternal, were nonetheless worthy of knowledge and appreciation, brought him into open opposition with the more puritanical members of the reform party, who, a few years before, under the leadership of Peter Damian, had launched a violent attack on interests which they thought unsuited to Christian students. These words of Damian illustrate their position. 'There are some men, obviously in their dotage, who, even after entering a religious order, are so absorbed in fabulous nonsense that they ruin their own characters and seem insane to those who hear them rave. For now they patch up the tattered tale of history, now they prate of the edicts and victories of bygone Kings, and thus they waste their days in the silly telling of old wives' tales.'121 Though Honorius shared to a con- siderable extent the reformers' antagonism to the reading of pagan authors by the clergy, he revolted against this attack on the study of the actual world and its history, and took pains to furnish Christian students with information about the world in which they lived. 117 Ch. 17; on the originality of Honorius' interpretation of the Donation of Constantine, see Car- lyle, op. cit., 290. 118 Ch. 21. 119 Chs. 26 f. 120 Summa totius, PL, cLxxII, 194 f. 121 De perfectione monachorum, ch. 23, PL, CXLV, 324 f.</page><page sequence="24">420 Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus In the preface of the Summa totius22 he described this brief epitome of universal history as a chronological summary of the entire Scriptures, but he used only the historical books, supplemented by Bede's Chronica, and for the later periods, by the Wtirzburg and Rosenfeld Annals as his major sources. The original portion of the chronicle extends only from 1121 to 1133. According to Endres' description, the older of the two extant manuscripts is a direct copy of Honorius' original, and illustrates his thorough methods of revision. The text is supplemented by many interlinoar glosses and by marginal additions and explanations, usually with references to the sources used.123 The introduction is an elaborate comparison of the seventy-two parts of the Bible with those of the human body. The historical record begins with the creation of man, and extended in the first edition to 1125, but was later continued to 1133. In contrast with Bede, Honorius based his chronology on that of Rome from the founding of the city. Thereafter he empha- sized Roman history, and from the time of Augustus organized his work according to the reigns of the Roman, Byzantine, Frankish, and German emperors.124 lie often mentioned natural phenomena, especially eclipses and comets, and included some geographical data, chiefly in connection with Germany. The narrative of events is very meager, with no attempt at analysis or interpretation. Only in contrast with the even briefer epitome of world history in the third book of Imago mundi can we understand his hope that so scanty a narrative would give his readers an adequate grasp of history. The most widely circulated of Honorius' works was the Imago mundi, of which there are more than a hundred manuscripts. The geographical sections were used in the Lucidarius, and the historical epitome in contemporary and later German chronicles. The book was excerpted in works on natural history through- out western Europe; it was translated into French, Italian, and Spanish, and was even used in the Saga of Olaf Trygvason.125 A comparison of this work with the last previous summary of natural history, the De universo of Rhabanus Maurus, shows that Honorius used a wider range of authorities than his predecessor, was more independent in the plan and content of his book, and, despite his usual fondness for symbolism, gave a more realistic picture of the world. He thus took a notable step in the transition toward the more comprehensive work of Vincent of Beauvais. Rhabanus described his themes as 'de rerum naturis et verborum 122 Only the section from A.D. 726 to 1133 has been printed, by R. Wilmanns, MGH SS, x, 128- 134, and PL, cIxxii, 187-196.

The manuscript transmission has been more thor- oughly explored than that of Honorius' other works, through-the activities of German historians, re- ported in many articles in the Neues Archiv.

Errors are generally traceable to the sources, though a few result from Honorius' own misinterpretation.</page><page sequence="25">Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus 421 proprietatibus, nec non etiam de mystica rerum significatione.'126 Only the first of these applies to the Imago mundi, which has relatively little emphasis on etymology and is conspicuously lacking in allegory. Bestiary lore, so constantly used in Honorius' sermons and scriptural commentaries, has no part in his natural history, for the fantastic animals he described as living in the remoter parts of the world are derived from the oriental and classical traditions that had long since fixed the flora and fauna of fabulous lands. The prefatory letters indicate that Honorius had the support of his associates at Regensburg in this undertaking, for Christian, later abbot of St Jacob, asked him to describe the world, as if in a picture: 'For it seems wretched to behold every day things created for our use, and to be as ignorant of their nature as dumb beasts.' In his reply, Honorius referred to the antagonism that such a book would inspire among men who publicly attacked his works, but furtively plundered them. He explained his title, Imago mundi, as signifying that the whole order of the universe is seen in it, as in a mirror.127 The first book surveys geography, astrology, and astronomy. The second chap- ter describes the five-fold creation of the world; first, its immensity conceived in the mind of God before the beginning of time; second, the sensible world in material form; third, the construction of the world in six days 'per species et formas'; fourth, the continuous process of creation by the reproduction of men, animals, and plants; and finally, the creation of the new world. The account of the habitable portions of the earth begins with Asia and paradise. His readers could not possibly form a clear idea of Asiatic geography from these descriptions, but they would find references to the traditional lore concerning its various regions, with more specific accounts of the sections prominent in Hebrew, Hellen- istic, and Roman history. The account of Europe also depends chiefly on the classical tradition. The insertion of a reference to Regensburg in the account of Germany has already been mentioned; allusions to other German cities, and to events in German church history, are inserted in the third book. Honorius shared the contemporary interest in the foundation-legends of European cities. His ac- count of Rome gives a curious theory that I have not been able to trace elsewhere: 'The ancients built their cities in the symbolic shapes of the chief animals. So Rome is shaped like a lion, which rules the other beasts like a king. Its head is the city built by Romulus, surrounded by brick buildings, whence it is also called Lateranis. Brundisium is in the shape of a stag, Carthage of a cow, and Troy of a horse.'128 The second book begins with a definition of tempus as the shadow of aevum. 'It began with the world, and will end with it. It is like a rope stretched from east to west, which is gathered up, until at last there is nothing left. The centuries extend along it, and beneath it move all things that are in this world. By it everyone's life is measured. By it the series of days and years is brought to a close.'129 An interesting point among the chronological data which compose this book is 126 Preface, PL, cxi, 9. 127 Imago mundi, cols. 119 f. 128 I, 28, col. 129. 129 ii, ch. 3, cols. 146 f.</page><page sequence="26">422 Honorius, Presbyter and Scholasticus the method for reckoning the Easter term: 'Begin with the root of the thumb, and count back on the joints of three fingers, and you will have the term on the fourth finger.'130 Honorius obviously did not expect his readers to be proficient in arithmetic. These books of the Imago mundi added nothing to the scientific knowledge of their time, but their emphasis on the interest and value of the actual world should have engendered a receptive attitude toward the scientific revival that was to come. The third book is a very brief epitome of history, following the traditional division of the six ages of the world; Honorius himself described it as 'a useful chronology, by which the reader can fruitfully study all the past ages of the world.""3 It begins with the fall of Sathael, the first of the archangels, and con- tinues to 1122 in the first recension, thus antedating the Summa totius by a short period.132 Honorius continued to revise and extend the work throughout his life- time, so that the manuscripts represent five different recensions, the last of which was completed after 1152. The continuations are fuller than the entries in tlhe original text, which suggests that they may have been intended to supplement the Summa totius as well. Later copyists added further continuations, the last of which extends to 1346. The record is scarcely more than a list of famous rulers and men. Among the pagan authors included are Homer, the philosophers, Hip- pocrates, Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, Statius and Josephus. The foundation or the destruction of a city is a characteristic item, and in the latter part of the chronicle there are frequent mentions of martyrs, bishops, and items of ecclesi- astical history. The deaths of emperors receive more notice than any events in their lives. In Honorius' historical works the priest was subordinated to the scholar. How long he exercised the active office of scholasticus is uncertain, but it was long enough for him to gain a clear understanding of the processes of education and the workings of students' minds. In his general attitude toward the secular side of clerical education, despite occasional vehement attacks on excessive devotion to pagan learning at the expense of Christian studies, he took a moderate view, considering that the students for whom he wrote were members of the clergy, whose major concern should be with Christian wisdom as against secular knowl- edge. The latter should not, however, be eliminated from their curriculum, for, as he said: 'The liberal arts are indeed useful, since they are the tools of Holy Writ, like a smith's hammers, and are weapons against heretics."33 A passage in 130 II, ch. 84, col. 163. 131 HI, exhortatio, col. 165. 132 Ms Cambridge, Corpus Christi, 66, part I (saec. xiii), includes a copy of the Imago mundi which ends in 1110; G. Waitz, Neues Archiv, v (1879), 644, took this evidence of an early recension. Since no other manuscript ends here, however, while the 1122 recension is abundantly represented, it seems more probable that the scribe in this case chose to end his copy at this point, than that it is the sole survivor of an earlier edition. The position of the Imrago in Honorius' list favors the later date.

Both from those who lead the contemplative life, and from those who lead the active life, I shall learn what most pleases him whom my soul loves beyond all else, that is, natural reason. For I have long sought it hitherto, in the scholars' lecture-halls, and did not find in them the way of truth."134 In the Offendiculum he satirizes those who slothfully neglect both divine and secular studies, and those who perversely distort them, as well as those who drink with gusto the insane arguments of philosophers, but are nauseated by the Scriptures.135 His attack on the 'citizens of Babylon' and the pagan authors in whom they delighted, in the preface to the Speculum ecclesiae, was probably aimed at the clever young men who returned from their studies in France to disturb the peace of the German schools by the contentious scholasticism they had learned under William of Champeaux or Anselm of Laon.136 He was not one of the extreme anti- dialecticians, for he had received thorough training in dialectics under Anselm of Canterbury, whose method and learning he introduced into Germany. The dia- lectic pattern of his early works was borrowed directly from his patristic sources and from Anselm; in his later dogmatic investigations he showed more original capacity in this field, though his skill was insufficient for full systematic develop- ment of the logical subdivisions of a complex theme. Like Anselm, and often by means of direct borrowings from his work, he employed dialectics to support and extend patristic theology, especially that of St Augustine.137 Thus he used Chris- tian dialectics to refute the worldly wisdom of the pagan philosophers whose rules it had adopted.138 Since man is a rational soul - 'rationalis anima corpore vestita dicitur homo'- the authorities on whom his faith rests must be tested by reason, for 'Authority is nothing else than truth proved by reason.'139 Three works Honorius composed as guides to a liberal education in a Christian society. De animae exsilio et patria'40 outlines the curriculuin for the study of great books in the several fields of the liberal arts, which he presents as the cities along the pilgrims' route from the exile of ignorance to the fatherland of wisdom, since scientia consists in 'rebus physicis.' It has often been criticized for its inadequate presentation of these arts, but Honorius' purpose was to show their respective values in the Christian curriculum, not to teach their subject-matter. The city of Grammar, ruled by Donatus and Priscian, presents the works of the poets; Rhetoric, under Cicero, instructs in civil and canon law, the civic virtues, and history, legend, oratory, and ethics; Aristotle's city of Dialectic has substantia as its citadel, surrounded by the nine towers of the accidents. In Arithmetic Boethius instructs in odd and even numbers, the use of the cribrum and abacus, and such mathematical diversions as the rhythmimachia, checkers, and other games played with dice. JBoethius also presides over Music, and Aratus over Geometry, which is limited in this case to its geographical aspect; Honorius seems to have had little 134 Com. in cant., i, 3, 1, col. 398. 13' Ch. 5, MGM, Libelli de lite, iii, 40. 136 PL, crxxii, 1085 f.

In Astronomy Hyginus teaches the use of the astrolabe, and Julius the computus. The three remaining cities are Honorius' additions to the seven Liberal Arts: Physics is described in terms of Hippocrates' healing arts; Mechanics has its walls built by Nimrod and its temple by Solomon, for the exercise of various crafts; Economics is the art of govern- ment, which teaches the hierarchy of the orders and offices of men, parallel to those of the angels. The Scala caeli, seu de ordine cognoscendi Deum in creaturis,'4 presents a theory of knowledge based on the nature of man; the symbolic ladder is charity; its rungs are knowledge, the guide of our activities in the present life, and wisdom, which teaches us to contemplate eternal life, and by the three orders of vision leads men to the third heaven. The discussion of corporeal vision attempts a general classification of created objects; those of the earth include stones, plants, animals, and the manifold races of men, with all the arts and artifices, diversions and offices of human society; those of the water comprise birds, fish, ice, storms, and sweet and bitter waters; those of the air are clouds, winds, thunder, rain, snow, hail, and dew and the first heaven, the material sky. This type of vision is shared by man with almost all living creatures, some of which, like the eagle, have sharper vision than man. By spiritual vision man sees objects similar to these bodily forms, through perception and memory, through imagination, by which we see objects which are unknown to us, but which are accepted as real, such as unicorns and griffins, as well as fabulous monsters such as the chimaera; by spiritual vision also we form plans, dream dreams, and see visions and prophecies. From this second heaven of spiritual insight man ascends to the third heaven by the intellectual vision which alone apprehends the true substance of men and of angels, the virtues, and ultimate truth and reality. The whole treatise, especially the description of the immaterial nature of the true hell and the true heaven, is based on John the Scot. The luminous metaphysics of the Cognitio vitae142 is based on Anselm's logical proof of the existence of God, the Monologium de divinitatis essentia, which Honorius reworked in briefer and more popular form as a dialogue, with con- siderable additions from his own reflections. At the outset he states his theme: 'Research into the essence of divinity, by the light of reason, hastens our journey toward eternal life.' The treatise is chiefly expository in character, for dialectic, however potent over human wisdom, is struck dumb by the majesty of the divine light. The argument is directed primarily against anthropomorphic and material- istic concepts, for God is a spirit, an invisible essence, incomprehensible to his creatures. He possesses essentially all life, all wisdom and all eternity, being him- self wisdom, truth, justice, eternity, 'omnem creaturam instar puncti in se con- tinens."l43 The temporal nature and the multiplicity of the world prove that it is 141 Op. cit., 1229-2140; only two manuscripts are extant.

As art is nothing else than the soul, and the soul nothing else than life, so the word of God is his art, and his art is life itself. Since God exists in all his creatures, all have equal existence; the worm lives as truly as the angel, though on a lower and mortal plane. The atom is no less real than Olympus, and even stones are conscious of God within them, inasmuch as they exist.'44 In answer to the pupil's question why students differ so greatly in their capacity to learn, when all minds have the same nature, Honorius used the familiar meta- phor of the sealing-wax and the candle to represent the plastic material of the mind, which needs study and training as the flame of truth to impress the seal, and to enable the candle to give light. The ultimate reason for the varying recep- tivity of men's minds to the divine wisdom rests in the incomprehensible judge- ment of God. He summed up his scholarly creed when he said that the teacher, being outside the student's mind, can only plant and water the seeds of knowl- edge; it is truth, dwelling within the mind, that creates wisdom.'45 SWEET BRIAR COLLEGE. 144 Chs. 21-22, cols. 1017-1019; the reference to the atom is quoted in Endres, HIonorius, p. 100, from a similar passage in Quaestio, utrum Deus ubique sit, in Ms Munich 22, 22.5. Today we need to be assured that Olympus is as real as the atom. 145 Chs. 35 f. cols. 1024 f.</page></plain_text>
