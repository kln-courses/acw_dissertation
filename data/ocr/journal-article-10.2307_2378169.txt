<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY L. P. CHAMBERS ORALITY, we used to be told, requires freedom of choice, while science is based on the principle of the absolute determination of all phenomena, in- cluding human conduct, by natural law. Thus was the dilem- ma stated in its crudest outlines. Science, on the one hand, thinks of man as part and parcel of a system of causes and ef- fects, every incident of which is predetermined by its antece- dents. Here there is no room for the unpredictable; or, to speak more accurately, our ability to predict is limited only by our ignorance of laws and causes, not by any indetermi- nateness in the nature of reality itself. On the other hand, the sense of moral responsibility, with the accompanying sense of remorse for evil done and gratification for good deeds, seems to demand the power of self-determination in man. If one can- not determine his own conduct he ceases, we are told, to be responsible for his conduct, he ceases to be a moral agent, and ethics, or the science of what man ought to do, is replaced by ethology, or the science of what man actually does. Man is either free or determined: if he be free, a science of human conduct is impossible; if he be determined, morality ceases to have any meaning. Is there any escape from this dilemma? And if not, shall we embrace science and discard morality as a false though sweet love; or shall we cling to our first love de- spite the claim of science that freedom is only an illusion? I Before we discard belief in freedom, let us ask ourselves what this freedom is to which we pledged our first love. i. Does it mean indeterminism pure and simple, caprice, the freedom to do whatsoever one "pleases"? Am I free to visit the moon, to turn back the hands of the clock and disport i63</page><page sequence="2">i64 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS myself in Queen Elizabeth's court, to paint the grass blue, or to arm myself at will with all the knowledge required to assure success in examinations without sacrifice of sleep or social ac- tivity in the interval? Obviously this cannot be what we mean when we speak of freedom; for if it were what freedom meant, it would have had no protagonist outside of the Wonderland which Alice found behind the Looking-Glass. Far from being undetermined in this sense, our activity is very definitely lim- ited by the physical conditions of our environment, spatial and temporal. The possibilities of activity are for me defined by the fact that I am living at this time and in this place and in such a world as is this earth of ours. Nor is pure indeterminism of this sort ethically desirable, any more than scientifically. If Wonderland were on this side the Looking-Glass and not the other, then would rational ac- tivity of any sort be as impossible for me in my waking life as it is in my dreams. And how then should I be held responsible for the consequences of my deeds, if any consequence might flow from any deed? Moral responsibility, no less than scien- tific investigation, requires that the results which follow my deeds shall be their inevitable sequence. For I can be held re- sponsible for the consequences of my deeds only in so far as I should and could have foreseen them, and in a purely indeter- ministic world foresight would be impossible. 2. But perhaps freedom means not absolute but limited in- determinism. Perhaps it means that, within the limits set by the physical environment in which my life is to be lived, there is still a choice to be made between a possible number of alter- natives. I cannot transport myself to the moon or to Queen Elizabeth's court; but I can, within certain limits of space and time, betake myself now to any one of the buildings on this campus, and it is of my own free choice, I will be told, that I am here. Was it, then, really possible that I might have been elsewhere? Should one's class at any time genuinely consider that a possibility, should they really think it as likely that one</page><page sequence="3">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY I65 should be elsewhere as that he should come to the classroom at the stated hour, they would not be there themselves. They come expecting one to be there, and their expectations are so far fulfilled. Were I an irresponsible person, a fit candidate for an insane asylum and not for a teacher's position, they might expect to find me elsewhere, though even then a knowledge of the psychology of insanity would tell them where they might expect to find me. But because I am a more or less responsible person they come expecting, nay, quite confident, that I will be there. Were I not there, they would be justly surprised. They would, however, not say, There is no reason; but would begin to speculate on the probable causes of my conduct. Evidently, then, not moral indeterminism but moral determination, not pure choice but a sense of duty, brings me to the classroom. Not that the duty is unpleasant-as Kant would have it be if it is to be dignified by the name "duty,"-nor this a place I would avoid if I were free to choose; but simply that my choice is not free; I am bound by moral obligation. It may be argued, however, that moral obligation is differ- ent from determination by the laws of nature, inasmuch as a law of nature cannot be violated, whereas moral obligation can and often is. I wonder if this is so; if, given my actual situa- tion-that I hereby earn my bread, to put it on no other plane -I could violate the obligation that takes me to the classroom. Should I do so, would not the college authorities say, He is not the man we thought he was? And would that not mean that, had I been the man they thought I was, I could have done no other than they expected me to do? And suppose that I were not the man I was supposed to be, suppose that my sense of moral obligation were too weak to take me to the classroom at the appointed hour, do you suppose that my conduct would then have been fancy-free; that it would have been in no wise determined? Or, in the absence of a consciously intelligent motive, would not my conduct have been guided by some other motive, by some stimulus from the outside or from that trou-</page><page sequence="4">i66 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS bled inner sea of impulses which constitutes the so-called sub- conscious world, and which, in the absence of conscious direc- tion, would determine the direction of my life? What I am, as well as where and when I am, determines what I shall do. And again, is it not ethically desirable that this should be so? For unless my conduct is determined by my character, what I do by what I am, I could not be held responsible for my con- duct, nor would there be any incentive for me to train and de- velop character. I seek by the repetition of certain deeds to form the habit of performing them; and by association with good books and good men to develop good manners. But if, despite the manner of my life in the past, I might at any mo- ment do anything whatsoever, habit ceases to be a fact, and character becomes more fickle than the wind. You could then depend on no one, and with loss of dependability the social or- ganism would break up. If society is to function, then de- pendability, which means determination by character, must be a fact. We have already seen that if I am to be held responsible for the consequences of my deeds, they must be the deeds' in- evitable consequence. This further would seem to be true, that if I am to be held responsible for the deed itself, as well as for its consequences, it- the deed- must be the inevitable conse- quence of my character. Not only physics, then, and biology, and psychology, but ethics as well would seem to require the postulate of determinism. Note, however, that I have said, "would seem to require," not "do require," for the question is not yet settled. However, the conviction that human conduct is in its nature and circumstances determined need not alter the structure of society. If, so argues the indeterminist, man is not free, if one could not have done otherwise than he did, then punishment is unjust. No, says the determinist, society will still reward her benefactors and punish her criminals, not because they could have acted otherwise than they did, but in order that the re- ward may add itself to the factors which determine the benev-</page><page sequence="5">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY i67 olent to his benevolence, and the punishment intervene as an inhibition between the criminal and his next temptation to crime. As Patrick puts it: The criminal pleads that his con- duct was the consequence of his motives and not his free act. Well, says the judge; we will give you some new motives for good behavior: thirty days.' II Are we then to conclude that freedom is after all an illusion; that we suppose ourselves to be free only because, as Spinoza says, we are ignorant of the circumstances which have deter- mined our conduct? Nevertheless the situation which gave rise to this illusion-if illusion it be-must have been a real situation; and if we explore that, we may find how the sense of freedom originated. Yet we must, to begin with, not take it for granted that freedom has been proved an illusion, but must keep an open mind. For it is wholly unscientific to regard free- dom as a false notion simply because it will not fit into any pre- conceived scheme, or because it threatens to upset the tidy universe which both science and morality seem to demand. And in any case, whether freedom be fact or fiction, man's sense of freedom has to be explained, not explained away. And yet is not the advocate of freedom, in insisting that man's sense of freedom be explained, by that very demand ac- knowledging that this notion could not have arisen sponta- neously but must have been conditioned to arise, since to ex- plain is to trace the relations and conditions of any phenome- non? If the advocate of freedom were prepared to discard the notion of determinism in reference at least to man's conduct and ideas, he would not seek their explanation; he would take them as they come, gifts from the gods, to be accepted with "natural piety," not questioned or explained. Nor should he be resentful of one who should say that his ideas have no basis in fact, for to be based in fact is to be necessarily connected I G. T. W. Patrick, Introduction to Philosophy, p. 329.</page><page sequence="6">i68 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS therewith and therefore not spontaneous. But why, on the other hand, do we seek necessary connections in nature; why are we concerned with the question whether changes occur spontaneously or in dependence upon their antecedents and accompaniments? Is it not that we may be able to foresee events and shape our conduct accordingly, or that we may se- cure desired effects by bringing about their causes? Now, fore- sight of effects from knowledge of their causes implies belief in the uniformity of nature. Perchance, then, this belief is a de- mand made upon man by his desire to explain phenomena, and not a belief imposed upon him from without. The determinist does, it is true, imagine that his belief is based upon observa- tion. "Search nature as we may," he says, "we come upon no unprompted change. "2 I wonder whether this is correct. I wonder whether the determinist ought not rather have said: "In nature, physical and human, we are continually coming upon changes of whose source and sequence we know nothing by observation, and which, therefore, for all we have observed to the contrary, may exist unprompted. We can, then, not say that we never come upon any unprompted change (experience suggests but does not in itself justify this statement); but we can say that we cannot afford to regard any change in nature as existing unprompted but must needs seek to trace its causes and effects, at least assume that it has such. For if we admit of any phenomenon whatsoever that it may exist uncaused, we open the door to indeterminism or spontaneous generation in regard to all phenomena; and have then no ground for assert- ing, even of those most familiar, that they cannot exist un- caused." '3 2 G. H. Palmer, The Problem of Freedom, p. 29. 3 It is interesting to note that Mr. Bertrand Russell, having rejected the a priori or intuitionist argument for "necessary connection" between cause and effect, regards the view that reality as a whole (and presumably therefore any part of it) may have come into being a few centuries or even a few seconds ago, as logically irrefutable. In other words, he regards the separate moments of existence as disconnected, so that nothing at any moment depends upon what has previously existed. Philosophy (New York, 1927), p. 7; see also chap. xi.</page><page sequence="7">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY i69 Such, it seems to me, is the case for determinism-a belief which is not based on sensory experience but must needs al- ways go beyond the evidence, since an "observed fact" is "evi- dence" only as it points beyond itself. But so accustomed are we to associate the observed phenomenon and what it "means," "implies," or "points to," that we are apt to imagine we have observed the causal connection; whereas all that we have ob- served, as Hume has made abundantly clear, is temporal co- existence or sequence merely. We do not owe our firm assur- ance of the uniformity of nature, then, to the fact that we have observed the totality of nature-this is obviously impossible; nor even to the fact that we have observed any "necessary connection"-at most we have invariably observed coexist- ence or sequence in those cases which we have taken pains to observe carefully; but we owe this conviction to the fact that we could neither act nor speak rationally, could construct neither sciences nor civilizations, unless we took present fact as sign or consequence of something else. This does not mean that the belief is unjustified: the success which attends our efforts when we act and think on this assumption, the fact tbat we have a civilization at all, offers continuous pragmatic justi- fication of the belief. But what we must bear in mind is that the belief is not one we adopt as a consequence of sensory ex- perience: for it would then extend only so far as experience had extended-if that far even, for, as Russell has pointed out, memory is pitifully fallible;4 and it would be wholly uncertain beyond experience, hence always uncertain with regard to the future, whereas it is in respect to foretelling the future that this doctrine is of most service. The doctrine of the uniformity of nature is one which we adopt under the impulsion of our desire to understand nature and our need to control her. It is man's theoretical and practical needs, and not external compulsion, which lead him to belief in determinism. Let us note, now, what has happened to our problem. We 4 Op. cit., p. 7.</page><page sequence="8">I70 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS started with the choice seemingly forced upon us between sci- ence and morality, between determinism and moral freedom. A critical study of the idea of freedom showed us that it cannot mean indeterminism. In a purely indeterminate world, a world of pure and disconnected chance, man would not be free to work out his purposes; he would, like Alice in Wonderland, be at the mercy of events. If I am to be free to work out my pur- poses, the world in which I live as well as I myself must be subject to determinable laws. If my typewriter had no fixed nature of its own I could not use it for the purpose of writing this essay. And if my nerves had no control of my muscles, or my "ideas" no relation to my nerves, my purposes would again be hindered in their expression. The physical and physiological worlds, if they are to be fit instruments for the purposes of man, must be through and through mechanical. Far from morality being the champion of indeterminism, moral freedom and re- sponsibility require a deterministic universe as the stage for human activity. Determinism is not the enemy, but the ally and handmaiden of freedom. But if moral freedom requires the postulate of determinism, it is equally true that the postulate of determinism implies a free agent. Were I not free to control nature-at least to pro- duce minor changes in the course of events in that small corner of the universe where I am-I would not seek to understand, for I would have no need to foresee. I would, like rock or tree, take what comes. Belief in determinism implies freedom no less than freedom implies determinism. I am no longer faced with the difficult choice between freedom and determinism, but with the more difficult task of uniting in one concept these two apparently contradictory and mutually exclusive postu- lates. We sought the source of the postulate of freedom, and have found it growing out of the same root as man's belief in determinism, namely, in man's innate impulse to explain in order to control.</page><page sequence="9">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY i7i III But even if it be granted that the desire to explain in order to control nature is the source of man's belief in the uniformity of nature, is this desire sufficient ground for the belief that the universe is intellectually explicable, or that any of the phe- nomena in it are humanly controllable? Perchance, as recent physical investigations seem to suggest, there is a surd in na- ture, an irreducible element of contingency and irrationality, so that bafflement is the ultimate fate of man's intellectual en- deavor. That this is not the case can never be empirically dem- onstrated. But what can be maintained is that willingness to acknowledge bafflement is fatal to man's intellectual and moral progress. If I once grant the futility of human effort will I not refrain from further hard endeavor? I may continue to act and think in terms of habit; but when habitual belief and be- havior fail to function I will not enter upon the difficult quest for more efficient conduct and adequate theory, but will as- sume that the limits of human capacity have probably been reached. If I am to persist in my endeavors I must have some hope of their success, some confidence in man's capacity to discover truth. And even if we acknowledge limits to the human intellect as intellect, just as we do acknowledge limits to the range of the human eye and ear, we need not-if we are sincere in our belief in evolution-assume that the intellect is the "last word" as an instrument of knowledge. Bafflement may be the fate of the intellect as such; but new faculties for the perception of truth may already be developing which shall so far surpass intellect as intellect surpasses sense. If, however, we may judge from the study of the past, the new is not to be imposed upon, but is to grow out of, the old. When the animal ceased to be satis- fied with the perception of color and sound; when, in other words, he was under the need of perceiving, by means of color and sound, objects and events for the knowledge of which sense organs are inadequate, then, doubtless, began the evo-</page><page sequence="10">172 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS lution of reason. In the same way, when man, through reason, seeks to perceive that which, by its very nature, baffles reason -and the limits of the "discursive understanding" have long been recognized by philosophers'-then may the super-reason be coming to birth. The intuition of the poet, the vision of the prophet, the "inner light" of the mystic-may not these be the dawn of new powers of perception? Our consciousness of an as-yet-unexplained-and, if you will, of an intellectually-in- explicable, and therefore "superrational"-element in nature, may indeed be due to the very fact that the intellect has the power to perceive more than it can clearly comprehend; or, as Bosanquet puts it, that man is more than he knows himself to be. My sense of freedom, my conviction that I have the shap- ing of my destiny in some measure in my own hand is a belief which seems to baffle all explanation and to challenge the in- tellect's claim that only in a deterministic universe can purpose be achieved, so that there can be no such thing as shaping one's destiny otherwise than has been predetermined. Yet, despite its conflict with common sense, this belief may prove to be a demand of the intellect itself, in so far as the intellect has in it the germ of the superintellect to be. But if I am to achieve new instruments of insight, new means of mastering my problem, I must not despise the intellect and pray to be miraculously en- dowed by some demonic or divine grace with a super-insight capable of solving all problems. I must use what tools of knowl- edge I have, and shape the new tools out of the old. So I turn to the intellect again and bid it, despite apparent bafflement, seek once more to blend, if it can, the apparently contradictory postulates of freedom and determinism. For these, as we have already seen, far from excluding, mutually imply each other. 5 Take, for example, Kant's distinction between "pure" and "practical" reason, the one limited to phenomena, the other revealing noumena; the Hegelian distinction be- tween "understanding" (what some have called the faculty of "logic-chopping") and "reason," (which, for Hegel, is not limited to what is usually implied by "intellectual- ism"); or, finally, Bradley's admission that the Absolute lies beyond the distinctions with which the intellect operates.</page><page sequence="11">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY I73 IV By contrast with what, then, has man been held to be free? i. First, by contrast with the stone which falls earthward because it is heavier than air, or gas which rises because it is lighter. The behavior of stone and gas is determined by "forces" acting from without -or, if we reject the notion of "force" as explaining nothing, we may say their behavior is describable wholly in terms of their relation to what is outside them- selves. And if it be argued that stone is heavier than air and gas lighter because of their own inner structure, is not that structure itself but a question of the external arrangement of the particles which constitute stone and gas? Here, then, we have a palpable distinction of fact, whatever be our explana- tion of that fact: that man is free, as stone and gas are not, be- cause the circumstances which determine man's conduct arise partly from within, and not wholly from without. We have here to do with the distinction between organism and mech- anismn. 2. But do not plants share with man this character of being partly determined from within? Are not they, like man, or- ganisms, and yet not accounted morally free? Wherein, then, does man differ from plants? Herein, at least, that, whereas the plant neither feels hunger nor fears the approach of preda- tory beast, hunger and fear are among the factors that deter- mine man's conduct. Sensation and instinct the plant has not (at least not obviously); but these man has. The one only lives; the other also remembers, hopes, and fears. The one is a physio- logical organism, the other is psychological as well. 3. But the lower animals share with man sensation and in- stinct, yet we do not impute to them moral freedom and re- sponsibility. Fear may inhibit a dog's inclination to touch a piece of meat, and joy may set his tail wagging; but the capac- ity of formulating moral principles and of passing judgment upon himself in terms of them the animal lacks. These prin- ciples may be conventions and these judgments illusions; but,</page><page sequence="12">I74 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS illusion or not, the capacity of formulating universal principles seems to be man's distinctive characteristic. By what neural mechanism these principles and ideas become efficient in con- trolling conduct it is hard to say; and if we adopt the view that man is, and always will be, more than he knows himself to be, it seems probable that man's experiences will always exceed his capacity to explain them, that is what makes the quest of truth eternal and keeps it permanently interesting. But, while we do not yet know how ideas affect behavior, that they do so would seem to be obvious to all except those who, in the interest of a preformed and tidy theory of the universe, refuse to acknowl- edge fact. For somehow the thought of examinations to come does determine to some extent how we shall spend the inter- vening days, while the thought of vacation to follow helps us bear arduous toil. This capacity of being determined by antici- pation of the future is the characteristic of self-conscious beings, the capacity to formulate ideals, to imagine a better state, and be governed accordingly. But does the recognition of this fact solve for us the problem of freedom? Does it tell us anything more than that man is not determined mechanically, as is the stone; nor organically, as is the plant; nor instinctively, as is the animal; but-in addition to all these modes of being determined-is determined intelli- gently, as befits a man? It still leaves him a creature of deter- minism. Will the chains hang any the lighter about our necks because we have decked them out with roses? Do the prison bars confine me any the less because I can look down upon my fellow prisoners and say: See how superior I am to you; for whereas your conduct is determined by instinct, mine is deter- mined by insight? Does intellect do more than make man a more delicate organism of response to environment than are the lower forms of being? Nay; do not the chains of deter- minism gall the more, and the prison bars press the closer upon me, just because I have intelligence enough to know I am a prisoner? If, then, intellect creates the idea of freedom and a</page><page sequence="13">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY I75 desire therefor, only to mock desire by showing freedom to be an illusion, it would seem as if intellect ceases to be a benefit; that with increase of wisdom must come increase of sorrow. But let us pause here long enough to put this paradox to our determinist gaoler: that (a) only he who is by nature free is conscious of his bonds.6 The eagle born in the cage does not beat its wings against the bars. What this means we shall try later to understand; for the present let it suffice to assert that it is man's glory to be conscious of his chains, for this proves at least that freedom is his natural inheritance. Had I not the instinct for freedom I would not ponder the problem of deter- minism. And here that other paradox again confronts us which we have already considered. For if it is true that only the free- born is conscious of bonds, it is also true that (b) only through his bonds can man demonstrate his freedom. For, let us bear in mind, the uniformity of nature, the universality of law, is not a belief imposed by nature on morality, but a postulate adopted by morality in its dealings with nature. Have we not agreed that it is because I could assume no responsibility for my deeds unless what happened was their inevitable conse- quence, and they in turn the inevitable consequence of my char- acter, that I assert the uniformity of nature, physical and hu- man, and acknowledge error and evil as my doing and not nature's? But the sense of error and evil implies foresight and the capacity to pass judgment on what has been in terms of the idea of what might have been. For in a universe determined wholly by its past, error and evil would have no significance. We do not attribute moral obloquy to a tornado; nor is the moth committing an error of judgment when it flies into the flame. Values have meaning only for a forward-looking crea- ture; but also only if the concept of values-not-yet-attained is in some way effective in bringing them to be, only, in other words, if choice between what is and what might have been 6 Or, as Hegel puts it: to be conscious of a limit is to have transcended it.</page><page sequence="14">I76 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS has been a genuine choice. Here, then, is our paradox. If I am to achieve values the universe which is to be the theater of those values must be through and through a reliable mechan- ism. But in a purely mechanistic universe values would have no meaning, and could have had no genesis. There is, however, a theory which holds that the so-called laws of nature are nature's habits, acquired laboriously, even as a man, desiring to be a musician, might deliberately and la- boriously acquire the technique of playing a musical instrument so that at last it becomes habit and second nature with him, to be performed mechanically on occasion of the proper stimu- lus. But the musician's reason for thus acquiring habits is not that habits are preferable to voluntary acts, but in order that the mechanical performance of acts already proved useful by trial and error may leave the creative spirit of the musician free to rise to higher levels of achievement undreamed of and in- deed impossible before. Now, it is not necessary to suppose that nature, in acquiring her earliest habits, acted as deliberately and consciously as does man; perchance conscious voluntary acts became possible only after ages upon ages of habit build- ing on the part of nature. Reality may have been at first not much more than the "formless matter" of Aristotle or the "omnipotentiality" of Bosanquet.7 As a theory of origins this view, that nature's laws are nature's habits, is interesting but indemonstrable.8 It does, however, offer a valuable suggestion 7 Aristotle denies indeed that formless matter is anything other than an abstraction. All actuality is matter partly endowed with form. He does, however, admit the exist- ence of matterless or pure form, i.e., God. The material universe is striving after the perfection of pure form, matter being a hindrance. Where there is no striving there can be no hindrance, hence no matter without form. Matter, then, is negation-though how a negation can be a hindrance is a problem. Bosanquet's term, "omnipotentiality," implies, not that the universe can produce anything and everything whatsoever (a view which Spinoza holds, since he regards the absolute as necessarily expressing itself "in infinite ways"), but that the energy or nisus in the universe, if blocked in one direc- tion, can always find some other avenue of self-expression. 8 Science and philosophy have left to mythology the attempt to trace the origin of reality-or, as Burnet puts it, to tell what there was before there was anything-and seek to describe what reality is now. It is interesting and useful to attempt to trace the changes which occur in one or other segment of reality; but to seek the origin of</page><page sequence="15">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY I77 toward the solution of our problem. For on this view deter- minism will be the ally and handmaid of freedom, not merely because it prescribes the limits within which man is free and supplies the mechanism through which that freedom is to ex- press itself, but, chiefly, because it wins more and more from the realm of uncertainty in the response of organism to en- vironment by making useful modes of response habitual, thus making the physical not a limitation upon the psychical but a more efficient instrument thereof, "nature" a more serviceable theater of "will." But if will creates its own habits, does it not become the slave of the habits it creates? Howsoever it may have been "in the beginning," the behavior of finite beings is surely determined by their own past history. So that even if Nature, the omnipotential absolute, be free not only to form new hab- its, but on the basis of these habits to develop new forms of be- ing and doing which these habits make possible, finite beings are surely only what the absolute makes them to be. In it they live, move, and have their being and by it they are determined. Is there, then, in the suggestion that nature's laws are habits of her own making, any intimation of freedom for the finite in- dividual? Or is the absolute the only free being; and, if it alone is free, what does freedom mean for it? V Freedom, in the sense of indeterminism, we have not found in man, and I doubt if it were desirable we should find it in the changes going on within reality is far different from the impossible task of telling where reality itself came from. For if, as Russell seems to think, any real might simply come to be without any necessary impulsion to be from what preceded it (indeed that type of atomic realism which would divide reality into time corpuscles as well as into space corpuscles would seem committed to the view that every "event," every point- instant, is a new and unrelated occurrence, so that reality is at every instant coming to be out of nothing), then we cannot tell where any reality came from, since by hy- pothesis it came from nothing precedent. If, on the other hand, we hold that any real can come only from an already existent real, then finite reals become merely changes going on within a cyclic totality of eternally existing reality; and since this totality is eternal, the question, whence it came, ceases to have any meaning.</page><page sequence="16">178 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS Absolute. For surely a God who is a bundle of caprice-as were the gods of preliterate man-could not command our loyalty or obedience since we would never know what his will is. We expect of God-or Nature, or the Absolute, or by whatsoever name you wish to designate the Ultimate Reality-that de- pendability at least which we look for in our fellows. Whether I sail my ship across uncharted seas or am burned at the stake for my convictions, I must believe that that on which I have pinned my faith is dependable and that, if error there be, it is mine and hence one which man can correct and not Nature's or God's before which therefore man would be helpless. But if not indeterminism, what of self-determinism? Obvi- ously not total self-determinism, if any, in finite beings. That only is self-determined which is self-sufficient; and, as Spinoza has pointed out, there is in the universe only one self-sufficient being, and that is the universe itself. If we call the universe "Nature" when we think of it in terms of law, and "God" when we think of it in terms of purpose; if we speak of "Nature" when we mean reality as it has come to us out of the past, and of "God" when we think of the infinite reaches of the future, then we may say, with Spinoza, that God alone is free, alone self-determined. But this, it will be argued, helps us not at all; for to say that the Universe is free is merely to say that that which has nothing beyond it is determined by nothing beyond itself. And even if this be not empty tautology, how does it help us? Spinoza affirms that even God can do no other than he has done since he could not be false to his own nature, and there is nothing outside him which would cause him to be so false. Self-determination for God, then, does not mean, for Spinoza, that anything could have occurred otherwise than it has occurred. If not, then, for God, far less could it have been for man. And my occasional feeling that I could have or should have done otherwise is due to ignorance of the forces acting upon me. But even if self-determination in God did mean some degree of choice, would that not still leave man in the shackles of determinism? Two questions therefore face us at this point:</page><page sequence="17">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY I79 (a) Can we, in the notion of the self-determination of God (or Nature) find any ground for the feeling that things might have been or ought to be different than they are? (b) If we find such ground, can we extend it to the finite individual, or can the finite cast upon God all the blame for his errors and misdeeds? The answers to our questions may, I think, be found in our conception of the relation of God to the world. And I use the name God in no distinctively theological sense-except as theology regards God as the "All in all"-but, as suggested above, to mean what Spinoza meant when he identified God with Nature, not, however, physical nature merely, but that nature which has given rise indeed to stones and stars, but also to the songs of birds, the courage of beasts, and the aspirations of man. How, then, does the activity of God manifest itself in the universe? i. Does God, like the builder, construct the universe out of pre-existent material and according to a preconceived plan- determined, therefore, as to the kind of universe he can con- struct, both by the nature of the material he has to use and the plans he has to follow? Under such limitations does Plato's demiourgos work; he is a creator to whom both the "matter" and the "ideas" of the universe are already given. 2. But whence has the builder his plans? From the archi- tect. And whence the architect his? Not from some other but from his own creative genius. The material conditions of the building are indeed prescribed for him: at just this spot, with this material, for this purpose, at this cost. And again, the psy- chical conditions of his activity are given: his character and training as they come to him out of his own past. You would not commission a musician or a poet to draw the plans of your house. Consummate artists they may be, each in his own line; but this is an architect's job, for him, namely, who has under- gone the discipline of an architectural training. The archi- tect's plans, like the individual's conduct, are determined by the psychical as well as the physical conditions of his being. But, given these conditions, how does the architect set about</page><page sequence="18">i8o INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS to draw his plans, since these are not simply "there" for him to copy? Some general plan he has, determined by the use to which the building is to be put; but this plan is tentative: he erases here, adds there, alters elsewhere, more slant to the roof, another tower-until at length, by what the scientist would call the trial-and-error method, he constructs the plans of a building whose proportions please him. Not, then, according to a pre- conceived plan, but by a creative act of genius has he brought into being a new bit of architecture. So too the sculptor first molds in clay the statue he is later to copy in marble or bronze. Had he known beforehand what the completed statue was to be he would have felt no need to make a clay model first. But it is something new he is making, product of creative genius, not copy of a predetermined plan. In a general way the artist knows what he is after; but the greater his genius, the farther does the completed task exceed anything he had dreamed of or conceived himself capable of producing. Like the musician who, violin in hand and improvising as he goes, lets the music of his soul play itself rather than himself plays, or like the bird bursting its throat with no premeditated melody but with the joy of life, so is the creative artistic task-the artist is the medium through which his genius expresses itself, beyond any conscious plan of the artist himself. Nay! the very power to create grows with the creating, and the artist excels himself- else were there no creation. May we not suppose that the God in Nature creates in this fashion, not according to some preconceived plan, but express- ing his soul, his genius in his creation, as the artist does in his; his capacity for self-expression growing by the very fact of ex- pression; his abundant life, unexhausted and inexhaustible, creating new forms at every turn, so that he exceeds himself, knowing not when he starts where he is to end. And if we meet the artist in his work, may we not meet God in his?9 May not 9 I use the masculine pronoun, he, because the neuter pronoun, it, suggests some- thing less than man, whereas the nisus or creative power in the universe is greater</page><page sequence="19">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY i8i man's moral struggle be Nature's own struggle for self-expres- sion? In stones and stars God reveals himself as form and mo- tion; in flowers and birds, as beauty, joy and life; in man, as reason, purpose, love. And if God be but another name for free creativity, the more there is of God in any of his creatures, the more there is of freedom. So that man-who, most of all ter- restrial creatures, bodies God forth; or, if you prefer evolu- tionary terms, man who is the present apex of creation on this earth-embodies most of the freedom of God, or of the Uni- verse: it is all one. But, it will be urged, the artist is not, after all, in his picture, nor need God be in me. The picture represents the artist's toil, time, and talents; but it is not part and parcel of himself. So is it with the singer's song and the poet's verse. So, too, it may be urged, are we, creatures not creators; made and determined in all our conduct by nature, not makers and determiners of our own destiny. Before we accept this conclusion, let us con- sider whether there be not some type of creative activity of man's-to serve us as analogy-in which creator and creature are the same, in which the product of man's activity is his own flesh and blood. To the builder, as we saw, both material and plan are given; to the architect the material is given, the plan is his own product. Is there a type of human activity in which material as well as plan are the maker's own; a type of sculp- ture in which the statue is carved out of the living flesh of the sculptor himself? If there is, we may here find a type of crea- tive activity nearest God's. than man. But the masculine pronoun-used however not in its limitation to the one gender but for want of a pronoun in English to denote all humankind-is not wholly inappropriate. For while one should avoid anthropomorphism in conceiving the Ulti- mately Real, man, nevertheless, must needs find godhead revealed in the highest which he can comprehend, therefore in himself at his best. If-and there seems to be no reason to affirm the contrary-there be beings in nature higher than man, he can come to ap- preciate their superiority only as he rises, in his power to appreciate, somewhat near their level. In other words, man can appreciate the better only as he attains somewhat near to the better himself, so that in one sense man will always be the measure for man. This is the explanation and justification of anthropomorphism.</page><page sequence="20">i82 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS 3. It is easy to see what this living sculpture is-the moth- er's creative act when she gives birth to her child. For months she has carried that life around with her, flesh of her flesh and bone of her bone, as much a part and organ of herself as heart and lungs, nourished by her blood, cherished by her thoughts. And in due time she gives to the world not a statue of cold mar- ble, beautiful and nothing more, but she gives to the world a statue of flesh and blood, living, breathing, one that feels and thinks. How out of a bit of protoplasm she formed a human being; how to that bit of protoplasm she imparted not form only but character, who can tell? Does the flower know how it molds clay and sunlight into lily and rose; the bird, how it sings; the musician, what force guides his fingers as he plays music the world has never heard before? Of what wonderful and inexhaustible forces we may be the instruments none can tell. We only know that such things are, and intellect can set itself the task to describe these processes, but not to explain. So before the mystery of birth we can but wonder and note that it is so, that of her own flesh and blood the mother makes a living soul. Nor yet is her creative task finished. She feeds her child at her own breasts; and long after it has learned to seek its own food, she watches over it, guides it, shapes, by precept and example, its habits and its thoughts. Like unto this, perchance, is the relationship of God to the universe; the creature is part and parcel of the creator. Yet the analogy is inadequate which is drawn from human parenthood, for the child separates itself from its mother, but Nature's chil- dren never separate themselves from her. We are not to think of some magnified being outside the universe, creating or giv- ing birth to it and then leaving it to take its own way, with oc- casional interference perhaps from divine providence. We are rather to think of ourselves after the fashion of the child still in its mother's womb, organic parts of the Great Reality. I shall use one other analogy, to bring out an additional point. My body has many members, but, normally, only one center of feeling and impulse, one seat of control; and, this control-</page><page sequence="21">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY i83 ling life seems to be more creative in brain than in hand and foot, for the brain designs and they carry out. Similarly, so far as such analogies may be taken as intimations of the nature of Reality, we may conceive the universe as one body with many members, but with one controlling life pulsing through- out. And this creative impulse, elan, nisus, omnipotentiality, or God, will be more creative, i.e., free, in some parts than in others. Creativity need not be a function of every part of the whole; rather do certain parts, the greater number, develop habits, which become instincts, then "laws," becoming me- chanical, precise, elaborate, wonderful in their workings, and yet instruments only; while in other parts, and, so far as man's experience goes, notably in man, does creativity still function, are new melodies played, new visions seen and bodied forth. VI Nature, then, has given birth to man, and mind is at home in the universe. The tragic picture which Russell draws of man adrift upon the ocean of blind omnipotent forces which are bound to crush him while yet he defies them in the name of an ideal which he knows to be only dream and illusion g0 the dis- illusionment of those humanists who find goodness only in man, but in nature the law of tooth and claw-though whence, on either view, man and his ideals could have sprung it is hard to see, unless we are to admit that something can come from noth- ing; such pessimistic views of the universe are fundamentally false. We are Nature's children, and not aliens in a foreign land. Her creative activity has produced us, and our creative activity has in its turn produced sciences and cities. Each nov- elty in this progress of civilization is a free creation in that it is not mechanically produced, but artistically fashioned. These creations were once ideals beckoning us on; but having worked themselves into the fabric of our civilization, they became hab- its (what science calls facts or laws) and drive us. In terms of his past, then, man is determined; but in terms of his future he IO See "A Free Man's Worship," in Mysticism and Logic.</page><page sequence="22">i84 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS is free, free not in the sense that he can ignore nature and do what he pleases, for he is bound by her commitments, and her habits are his laws, but free in the sense that he can, on the basis of these laws achieve novelties hitherto undreamed of, unpredictable, impossible but for those very laws and habits. Not, then, is man free in the sense that he can set himself up against nature, but that he is at home in the universe; not a mind imprisoned in the body, but a body expressing itself through that novelty we call mind. Let man say, "I am a being apart from Nature and alien in the universe," and he there- upon feels natural law as a chain about his neck. But let him say, "I and Nature are one; through me Nature speaks, works, comes to fruition," and he becomes free with the freedom of God, the freedom of self-determination. So do the prophets, when they speak, say, "Thus saith God." So did Jesus say, "I am in God and God in me," and bade all men say the same. So do the mystics of all ages speak. I do not suggest that the prophets or Jesus or the mystics had any metaphysical theory of freedom, but rather that creative personalities are the points at which Nature's creative activity is most fruitful. But let man lose courage and feel natural law hang as chains about him, and he then forgets that the question whether he is not wholly determined is such a question as only he whose heritage is freedom can ask. And yet pessimism is not without grounds, though the grounds of pessimism are also the grounds of optimism; the beatific vision and bitter disillusion grow from the same root. It is because man is the instrument of forces which in their in- exhaustible potentiality far exceed not only what the past has achieved but what at any present moment is possible, that man feels a lack of harmony-and in sensitive souls a most bitter disharmony-between Nature and God, between what is and what ought to be. Then, like Hardy, does he begin to question whether Nature be not Godhead dying slowly from the top, brain and eye first gone; a blind, ruthless Will making sport of man. But this disharmony, this lack of balance between or-</page><page sequence="23">MORAL FREEDOM AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY I85 ganism and environment, is at the same time the condition and the price of progress. Disharmony is the condition of progress because organisms which have struck a balance with their en- vironment stagnate, do not further evolve. And it is the price and token of progress just because disharmony and disaffec- tion indicate that in man Nature's inexhaustible capacity for better things is restlessly at work, the "Hound of Heaven" re- lentlessly pursuing man, lest at any moment he should be sat- isfied and, so far as he is concerned, Nature's creative activity should cease. The philosophy of today is testing out a new theory-that of emergent, or, in Bergsonian terminology, creative, evolu- tion. Bergson's creative being is the elan vital; Alexander's is the nisus which beckons reality on to Deity. Emergent evolu- tion, in its recognition of the emergence of unpredictable nov- elties, seems to have left sober science behind, with its mathe- matical equivalence of cause and effect, and to be returning to a view suggestive of the Church's doctrine of special creation. But whereas the Church placed the creative power outside man, so that he was left as much determined as ever, by the material environment below him, in which God's fiat had placed his living soul, and by God above him, in whose hands lay that soul's destiny, emergent evolution finds the creative activity in man himself and everywhere where novelties are emerging. Now, emergent evolution seems to be a more adequate account of what man experiences in his more characteristically human activities than is the doctrine of repetitive evolution, which finds nothing creative in development, but only new combina- tions of old elements. If, then, emergent evolution be true, or at least a step in the direction of truth, it would seem to lend countenance to the idea which I have been striving to express, that where Nature is still creative, that is, at the apex where man stands, there is freedom, but supported on a substructure of habit and determinism.
