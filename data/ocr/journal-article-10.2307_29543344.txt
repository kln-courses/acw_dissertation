<plain_text><page sequence="1">DRAWINGS AND CLIENTS: LE CORBUSIER'S ATELIER METHODOLOGY IN THE 1920s Timothy Benton Iseem to remember writing, in a review of The Open Hand,1 that Le Corbusier studies had attained a level of pedantry without passing through a phase of mature critical understanding. I was thinking of the wisecrack which stigmatised the United States as having passed from barbarism to decadence without an intervening stage of civilisation. The fruits of research among the archives at the Fondation Le Corbusier are beginning to emerge: the last of the four volumes of the Sketchbooks are out, to be followed shortly by the forth? coming series of volumes of the complete architectural drawings.2 Neither event will advance Le Corbusier studies in any major qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, degree although they will both encourage a new and more advanced degree of pedantic scholasticism among the Corbusian scholars. Needless to say, I have to count myself among the pedants. I greet any documentation of Le Corbusier's work with the eager appetite of the archaeologist for shards of pottery. It is all the stuff of historical research. What I want to discuss is primarily technical ? about the difficulties encountered in the study of this material. If there are insights into Le Corbusier's methodology and practice along the way, all the better. The main problem, of course, is characteristic of all historical enquiry. It can be stated baldly in terms of a conflict between theoretical and empirical investigation. You might find here a reflection of the conflict between any kind of holistic, or historicist, form of history ? one that looks for some general explanations and universal trends, or at least some 'direction* and 'meaning* ? and the versions of Popperism and pragmatism much in vogue in Britain nowadays. I mention this because, when a historian raises a question like 'What does a building mean?' or 'Why was it designed as it was?', he is likely to have very little direct evidence to go on. Normally, architectural historians fall back on a range of data: ? Evidence (very rare) of an architect's stated intentions. Even when it exists in contemporary publications, the historian will have to scrutinise it carefully. ? Immersion in the cultural context and the specific ideology of the architect and his circle. ? Subjective critical analysis by the historian himself ? what the building means to him. Necessarily, this involves an exchange of values between two cultures, the historian's and the architect's. We all know the results: the Villa Savoye has been compared to a spaceship, to Palladio's Villa Rotonda, to a Cubist painting, to a Greek temple. Its meaning has been 'explained' in so many different ways that its place in modernist mythology has become highly unstable. To escape this chaos, we need a rather scrupulous attitude to evidence. Most usually, we combine elements of all three, without any certainty that our ensuing judgements are in any sense 'true'. We finish up caught in the paradox: ? It is usually impossible to 'prove' general explanations: the historian must rely on evidence which can 'test' hypotheses until one emerges as clearly superior to its rivals. ? Statements about architecture which confine themselves to the 'evidence' will not normally supply answers to any of the interesting questions, about meaning, content ? formal and ideological ? and causality. What makes the study of Le Corbusier's practice so interesting to the historian is that here is a body of documentary and visual evidence so rich and apparently complete that there does seem to be a real possibility to test generalising hypotheses against concrete data. Let's look at 'causes'. What can be said to have 'caused' a 42 AA FILES 3</page><page sequence="2">building to be as it is? Despite the great weight of documentation for the projects I have been studying, there is virtually nothing which provides hard evidence of intention. In most cases, there is virtually nothing on the client's wishes either, since these matters were normally covered in spoken dialogue. We will be able to ask questions like 'How much did a building cost?'; 'What were the estimates on a preliminary project?'; 'How long did it take to design?'; 'What technical problems emerged in construction or afterwards?'; and so forth. And from the drawings we will be able to ask questions like 'How many stages did the design go through?'; 'What seems to have occupied most of the architect's attention?'; 'What proportion of the work was done by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret or the assistants?'; 'What kind of design problems were encountered?'. The trouble is that to answer most of these questions will involve putting the hundreds of drawings into some kind of order. And only ten per cent of these at most are dated, either in writing or by reference to the atelier log book or by reference to the documents. So even here we are thrown back to a set of assumptions and hypotheses of how Le Corbusier worked ? the logic or rules of his practice. We still seem to be some distance away from arriving at 'causes' for a work of architecture. One of my Open University colleagues has taught us a useful mnemonic device for understanding 'a cause': INUS. A cause is an Insufficient but Necessary condition forming part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient constellation of conditions. Adapting this somewhat, we can assemble, at any given time, a convincing account of the Unnecessary but Sufficient constellation of conditions affecting Le Corbusier's practice. ? We will have to include the complete 'design philosophy', what Le Corbusier called his 'doctrine', which we can reconstruct as best we can from his writings ? books, articles, letters, lectures, and his criticism.3 Fortunately, his belief in 'rereading his own work', preserved above all in books like Precisions in drawings as well as words, gives us precious insights into his own memory of design decisions. But we will still not be able to show that this post-facto analysis explains the building. ? We can analyse the 'facts' of the particular commission: the client, the site, evidence of construction and completion, and the finished building. From this we can deduce, without subjective bias, at least some of the conditions of production which were there, but which may or may not have been causal. An example: if you inspect the site of the Villa Baizeau at Carthage, you might make assumptions concerning the construction of the building which had no bearing at all on the designs ? since neither Le Corbusier nor any of his staff visited the site. Indeed, to understand the design process, as opposed to the construction, we need to know that it was done on the basis of an ambiguous site plan and a group of snapshot photographs (in the files of the Fondation Le Corbusier). The causes which I want to concentrate on in this discussion are particular: those that are 'necessary' for each design and for which evidence can be adduced. And I will offer some suggestions as to how the general conditions of production (including the 'doctrine') relate, in a dialectical fashion, both to the material process of design within the atelier, and to the dialogue, more or less acute in each case, with the client and the particular 'facts' of the project. I would like to begin with some general remarks about the nature of the evidence and some characteristic difficulties it produces. First, the evidence varies in kind, for specific reasons to do with contingent circumstances, from project to project. We will have to be careful not to allow our analysis to be overly swayed by these differences. For example, we have seen that the Villa Baizeau at Carthage, in Tunis, was designed 'at a distance'. Neither Le Corbusier, nor any of his assistants, visited the site, although the client did visit the rue de Sevres on various occasions. Consequently, much of the dialogue between client and architect, carried out verbally and unrecorded when the clients lived in Paris, are, in this case, documented in letters and even drawings. Indeed, many important features of the house as completed were originated by the client, not the architect.4 A more typical case is that of the Villa Savoye, where the recorded statements by the client are almost entirely to do with payments or complaints about technical faults in construction and after. In the Baizeau case, there is nothing about the actual construction, since this was carried out by the client's own firm. In the Savoye case, there are four boxes full of estimates and bills which record every stage of building, and the tenders for the preliminary projects as well. So, when I represent the Baizeau project as largely a 'dialogue between architect and client' and the Villa Savoye as 'an internal dialogue within the design process' ? which I'll come back to ? I have to be very careful that I am not simply passing on characteristics of the documentation as if they represented 'causes' and part of the 'meaning' of design. Second, the evidence is always partial. One of the jobs of the researcher is to form an idea of how complete the evidence is and where the gaps might lie. Take the apparently simple question of the cost of a building project. Faced with a huge number of bills and estimates, the temptation is simply to add up the totals and declare this the cost of construction. But if you lay out the evidence in a chart, you find how many gaps there are, and you then have to estimate as best you can what the lacunae fail to disclose. The same goes for drawings. Third, the evidence of the buildings themselves, as they have survived, is partial and often confusing. The Villa Stein, for example, has been subdivided into apartments. Colours must always be regarded with suspicion. Only rarely do the colour samples and indications survive.5 Windows and fittings must always be checked against the documentation. Surroundings change. My main interest is in trying to form a picture of the design process in Le Corbusier's atelier during the 1920s. The first practical stage is to try to establish a secure sequence of events, the design stages, in each project. As soon as you start trying to do this, you realise that you need a model for the modus operandi. Each of the projects we are going to look at went through a bewildering number of changes in the design process. Few of the drawings are dated. Very little in the documentation appears to provide specific information about the design stages. How do we proceed? One stereotype, which it is all too easy to fall back on, is that of a teleological progression towards the finished building. This makes two assumptions: ? Those drawings most dissimilar from the finished work should be placed at the beginning of the design process, and the others arranged according to a progressive approximation to the finished work. ? The technique and style of the drawings would be expected to progress from 'idea' (sketchy) to exemplification (measured drawing). Similarly, we might expect Le Corbusier, as chief designer, to be most active in the early, sketchy stages, while Pierre Jeanneret and the assistants would take over in the later stages. There is clearly something in this, which we will try to pin down after we have studied some cases. But it is a dangerous model and it rarely helps us with the doubtful drawings. Let's look at one AA FILES 3 43</page><page sequence="3">simple example about which there can be no doubt. The Villa Savoye has, as a key feature of the design, a roughly U-shaped plan form to the ground floor (see Oeuvre Complete, Vol.11). The rationale for this ? based on the turning circle of a car ? was stated by Le Corbusier. Note also the ramp, one of the most famous features of the villa. The working drawings were prepared around April 1929. We know that a developed project for the villa was submitted to the client in October 1928 (published in Oeuvre Complete, Vol.1), and there are a number of drawings which go with this. There are a number of obvious and close similarities with the working drawings. In fact the projects are close enough to have been confused even by the editors of Oeuvre Complete.6 What do we make of this drawing (fig. 1)? It is sketchy, unresolved. The idea for circulation under the house seems to be schematic. There is no ramp. Is this before or after the plan published in Oeuvre Complete, Vol.1? And what about this one (fig.2), which can be dated precisely by comparison with drawing no.19635, dated 6 November 1928.7 Could it be a mistake in dating? But the other evidence is over? whelming. These drawings form part of the second project, after the October scheme, one of a number of drawings which eventually led to a solution, late in November (fig.3). How can this be? Not only is it indisputable ? the 26 November scheme was numbered and delivered to the client ? it is, in terms of Le Corbusier's design process, inevitable and necessary. The three most important and dated stages of the design can be compared in fig.4, showing perspective views from the west, redrawn from original drawings in the Fondation Le Corbusier. We can explain this apparently absurd kink in the flow of design, and the episode adds meaning to the final work rather than taking it away (see note 6). Part of my fascination with these drawings is what they tell us about the plurality of meaning in architectural features. Take the false window on the northwest facade, top floor. If asked to explain the meaning of this window, what would you say: 'Virgilian' relation with nature? An end point of the promenade architecturale, etc.? Bridge of a ship? And the curved form of the solarium: Sun trap? Curved form = nature? But the study of the design process informs us that this was Madame Savoye's bedroom, a most important area in the original design {Oeuvre Complete, Vol.1, p. 187). Trie curved form here had a different connotation: luxury of the expansive free plan, anthropomorphic, bodily form. And the window was Madame Savoye's bedroom window, the focus of the whole house. How much of this remains, fossilized in the form of the building? One task which we can perform, therefore, is to reveal the signifying strata within a design left over by earlier rejected projects. It is very easy to be misled by our assumptions of what a building is about. Take the Villa La Roche. As built, clearly this house is intimately bound up with Raoul La Roche. The programme contains the following elements: ? A maison de collectionneur. In a letter to Ozenfant in 1925, Le Corbusier himself specifically rejected this notion, which was redolent of Patout's Pavilion at the 1925 exhibition, and insisted on taking down some of La Roche's paintings in order to leave the architecture 'pure'. La Roche refers to this argument himself in a letter, describing his brief to Corbusier in terms of a 'cadre pour ma collection9, and noting that Corbusier had responded with a 'poeme en murs9 ? so beautiful that it was a shame to hang the pictures. 1.Ground-floor plan for the Villa Savoye, second project, c.6 November 1928 (FLC 19659). 2.

So we also have the theme of a Purist building which itself constitutes the masterpiece in the art lover's collection. ? And in the Oeuvre Complete (Vol.1, p.60), Corbusier lays great stress on the ceremonial aspect (the promenade architecturale) in a context which links the spatial treatment to the notion of the poeme en murs, a spatial and volumetric spectacle. Most historians have seen the various early projects for the Jasmin site as revolving around Albert Jeanneret and La Roche, with the addition of other clients. In particular, the large house at the end of the private road, identified by Corbusier himself in the Oeuvre Complete (Vol.1, p.58) as the first project for the maison double La Roche-Jeanneret and dated 1922, seems to confirm this. But the documentation not only fails to confirm this view, but excludes it. The first client mentioned, in Corbusier's letter of March 30 to Esnault, Director of the Banque Immobiliere de Paris, is a M. Sarmiento. By April 14, two clients are specified: Albert Jeanneret and Mr Motte, avocat. A drawing (15102) shows three plots, including the conciergerie mentioned as 'votre pro jet de l?ge de concierge' in Corbusier's letter of April 13. These three plots are identified as 'Mr M' (Motte), 'Mme R' (Lotti Raaf, Albert's future wife) and 'Mr Dup'.8 On April 21, Esnault writes to indicate Plousey's refusal to sell the plots on this side of the road. What we can conclude from this is that the large house at the end of the road (in Oeuvre Complete, Vol.1, p.58) was certainly not for La Roche, and not for Albert and Lotti, since there are not enough bedrooms for the latter, and the planning of the twin bedrooms and bathroom hardly accord with La Roche's bachelor status. The house is a 'type', one of Le Corbusier's Parisian house projects, intended, one supposes, to impress on the Bank the smartness and elegance of the proposed development and the artistic skill of the architect. This stage of the design is therefore quite unspecific. The subsequent stages of the design, which soon introduced a fourth client (mentioned in a letter of April 23), developed the other end of the private road. One of these schemes, for a three-house arrangement, dated May 15 (15099), occupied the site of the La Roche house, but again it included far too many bedrooms for the La Roche programme. And there is a four-house version (15116 and 15115) (fig.5), which I date as pre-28 May, because Albert's Music Room is shown on the wrong site (Lotti was granted permission to buy the other site on that date).9 Again, nothing in the plans of the house on the La Roche site indicates conformity with the La Roche programme ? there are five bedrooms. A version of this scheme was probably still in question on July 17, when Corbusier asks permission to purchase a site for a garage on the north side of the road. Only after this, in a revised version of the four-house scheme (15103) (fig.6), do we find mention, on the drawing, of La Roche and Marcel as the clients of the two large houses. And immediately there is a radical loosening up of the design: a dramatic ramp in the hall is sketched in at the corner of house I (La Roche) ? and this is shown in greater detail in 15254 (fig.7) ? and the programme, while including two bedrooms, leaves most space for reception and library. All this supports the significance of a specific iconography appropriate to the La Roche programme, introduced only when the particular client entered the scene. The juxtaposition of curved walls and straight, surely a comment on walls for pictures and walls for pure contemplation, the juxtaposition of ramp and library, of separation of living cell from ceremonial spaces ? all these were to play a key part in what was to follow. But, as Tafuri would say, there is more. After the refusal of Esnault and Plousey to sell the plot of Marcel's house, which Le 4.

Sketch first-floor plan to match the above, 22 September 1923, showing the bridge across the hall. Corbusier was still contesting on September 17th, but before September 20th, when Corbusier had accepted the situation with bad grace and referred only to two houses, he attempted variants of a three-house solution, in which the third house is labelled 'Sa tante' (figs.8 and 9). Whether this was La Roche's aunt is not clear, but in Le Corbusier's letter of August 6th it is identified as a plot which La Roche would buy for re-sale. In order to provide space for a garage on the ground floor of the La Roche house, we find an empty space, and the ramp-hall, dividing La Roche from the existenz-minimum dwelling for the Aunt (fig.9). When on September 22nd, Corbusier abandons this scheme, he retains the split functions (15291 and 15276) (figs. 10 and 11). The garage and ramp-hall become the double-height entrance hall, and a bridge connects the dualist functions of living (Aunt ? now manservant on the ground floor and dining room and bedroom above) to ceremonial (La Roche ? now gallery and library). It only required the elimination of La Roche's living quarters on the ground floor under the gallery to make this dualism complete (see Oeuvre Complete, Vol.1, pp.64-5). Once again, the history of the project explains key features of the building as completed which would remain opaque otherwise. Just as the chronological sequence of designs leave traces of form and meaning in the executed building, so there is a horizontal interface between different projects being worked on at the same time. One task I want to perform is to establish a chronological catalogue of all the drawings, for different projects, being worked on at one time. The reason for this is that there are frequently important elisions of meaning and content from one project to another. There is an important technical point here. In 1972, when I first looked at the Le Corbusier drawings, they were still in the coal dust-covered rolls in which they had been stored in the cellars of the rue de Sevres. Drawings for different projects were frequently jumbled up, as a pile of drawings on a draughtsman's easel were rolled up and put away. Since then there has been a lot of sorting, mainly by Roggio Andreini, who tried to put the drawings for different projects together. He missed several, which are still wrongly classified in the microfilms. The result is much clearer, but the original jumble was a very precious testimony, which has been lost without trace, because it revealed the original couches of the archaeological evidence. Even now, the 'wrong' drawings which have survived in each set are revealing. For example, some of the Savoye group of drawings are actually for the Salon des Artists Decorateurs exhibition of furniture in 1929. And in the Baizeau set are a group of interiors for the Wanner apartment schemes of 1928-9. In both cases, the similarities of the drawings help to draw attention to fundamental links across design projects which might otherwise have escaped notice. The same kind of confusions exist among the documents, and it is worrying that the personnel at the Fondation intend to embark on a typically French 'thesaurus' of the material which will entail, apparently, pulling the documents out of their boxes where Corb's secretary had stored them and classifying them according to an academic thematic organisation. Fortunately, this scheme seems to have been abandoned. A case in point, where any tampering with the boxes would make nonsense of the material, is to do with the Villa Stein. It is an example which also reveals a conflict in evidence, where we are left to hypothesize. In the box of Stein documents, a sketch of various pieces of the Steins' furniture lay next to the notes of a conversation with Madame Stein (dated May 7th, 1926) which we can take to be the brief for the Villa Stein/de Monzie. It is easy to see that the two relate together: although whether one would have AA FILES 3 47</page><page sequence="7">spotted it if they had been stored separately, under 'Client' and 'Furniture', is another matter. A key point in the notes is the division of the house between the Steins and Gabrielle de Monzie. In the house as built, this division is not at all apparent. The next date in the evidence does not occur until July 20,1926, when there is a complete set of numbered drawings (fig. 12), including some beautiful coloured renderings, presumably presented to the client.10 There is no record of their response to this scheme. The next dates are October and November, when the contract is signed and a project broadly similar to the one executed is prepared. I won't discuss the similarities between the July 20th scheme and the October-November drawings here, but the main point is that the terrace is on the wrong side and the service extension is eventually condensed into the main cube. The key difference is in the grid: AAAAAB not ABABA. But what about figures 13 and 14 (31051 and 31052)? They are very diagrammatic. I take them to be a rather rare diagrammatic notation of the client's needs, based on the May 7th meeting. Note the symmetry of the arrangement, the division into Stein/de Monzie halves, with a terrace in the middle. The elevations relate back to the early schemes for Auteuil. But if we agree to date these drawings around May 7th, what about figures 15 and 16 (31049, 31048, etc.)? Like the first two, they are simple, diagrammatic, symmetrical. Both include alien material: the La Roche hall of Autumn 1923 (bottom right, 31049; cf. fig.7: no. 15254) and a scheme for the Stein/de Monzie house in its later arrangement (after October)11 (top left 31048). But these drawings are based on the ABABA grid. So we seem to have a conflict of criteria. Fernando Montes and his team of students in Paris (UP6) took these drawings very seriously.12 They saw them as coming after the July 20th project, forming part of the preparation for the October-November schemes. They did so, presumably, because they attributed great importance to the grid. To them, this was what the Villa Stein was about. But other features are much closer to the May 7th scheme: ?Symmetry. ?Division of the house into Stein and de Monzie halves. ?Diagrammatic quality of the drawings. It is not a clear-cut case, but I was convinced by one detail. In drawing 31048 we see a number of shapes, unusually indicating furniture at so schematic a stage of the design. They do not recur in other drawings. Now, we know that the Steins had a lot of antique furniture which they wanted to keep, and these were recorded in the drawing and document of May 7th and can be seen in the photographs of the finished building.13 I see the sequence as, 7 May: First talks and sketch of diagrammatic symmetrical semi-detached house plan (with furniture) and ABABA grid (figs. 13-16). June-July: A new tack, perhaps responding to the Steins' desire to have plenty of gallery space, both inside and out, for their works of sculpture. Two coloured sketches (10584 and 10587) were probably dashed off to show the possibilities of a looser plan ? and terraces ? with a regular grid and the spectacular promenades around the terrace (these omitted here for lack of space). I see them as intended for the clients' eyes and as leading on to the July 20th scheme, with a regular 5-metre grid of columns. The July 20th scheme (fig. 12) works these up into a coherent plan, but with an extruded service wing. The regular 5-metre grid survives, but the terrace is moved round to the other end of 12.

October onwards: The effort of cramming the service wing back into the house reintroduces the grid, now with very different connotations, based on an ABABA rhythm. All this raises several procedural questions. Only when we can find a plausible role for all the drawings can we reasonably establish a chronology, but even then there are going to be questions which we will have to leave open. We will often have to contrast opposing types of argument (documentary evidence against drawings; design ideas, like the grid, against planning requirements; and so on). We must try to establish who a drawing is for: for the client, from L.C. to P.J., from P.J. to L.C., etc. We must be careful not to jump to conclusions. On a drawing for the big ground floor hall window of the Villa Savoye (19505), which we can date with precision to December 1928, we find a little sketch of a symmetrical, classical building rather like the Villa Rotonda. It might give us an excuse for a Colin Rowe-like analysis of the origins of the design.14 But, if we do so, we must be aware that the drawing must post-date the basic design of the villa by some six months. On the other hand, I do allow myself to get excited by this marginal sketch (fig. 17), on a drawing for the Villa Baizeau (24983), which can be dated to March 1928, six months before any documented connection with the Savoye family. Are they simply Baizeau doodles on the theme of 'a house on a hill', a 'house with four facades', a theme which later recurred at Poissy? Or is this an early design for the Poissy site? Either way, it can be shown that the Baizeau and Savoye projects are interrelated. Another pair of drawings (both on 30144) grouped in the Ocampo villa designs of September-October 1928 seem to be even more specifically related to Savoye. These are among the few genuine 'design' drawings, in which an architectural idea is being evolved on the paper.15 They make specific reference to the Poissy site, but they are so generalised as to defy absolutely precise analysis. We are going to have to decide what status to give to drawings like these. Do they allow us to revise or enrich our reading of the building, or is it only part of the architect's kitchen, best left in the technical folder? What lessons can be drawn from all this? There are some simple observations: ? Le Corbusier usually worked out preliminary schemes in his head before putting them on paper. Rough sketches are more likely to be found in the course of correcting intermediate projects than in the initial stages of design. ? Projects tend to begin too large (too expensive) and general in character, becoming tighter and more complex under pressure from the client and adjustments required by the design process itself in contracting the first idea. ? The response to obstacles encountered tends to take an extremely violent form, opting for radically different solutions rather than compromise modifications. The main stages of the Baizeau project confirm this.16 We could work towards an illustration of the dialectic between 'doctrine' and 'process'. We could see this as sometimes an equivalent to a dialogue between architect and client, or between the 'ideal' and the 'pragmatic', or between the 'formal' and the 'planning aspect'. Often the general scheme at the outset is rooted in the 'standard' ? usually a Citrohan or Esprit Nouveau-type unit, which becomes transformed into a house for a particular person, a particular site. One explanation for the apparently arbitrary nature of the 75. Two sheets of plans of early project for Villa Stein-de Monzie (ignore the sheet top left), c. 7 May 1926 (FLC 31048). 16.

AA FILES 3 49</page><page sequence="9">deign process could be given by depicting these dialectics in graphic form, as two kinds of iterative decision-making process: ? From the architect's point of view (doctrine-ideal, standard, general), but also formal (volumes assembled in light) and technical (all the work of planning, adjusting). ? From the client's point of view (practical, etc.) which overlaps with the former. Notes 1. The Open Hand Essays on Le Corbusier, ed.

Colour samples have survived for the villa Baizeau and the houses for the Weissenhof Siedlung exhibition, Stuttgart, 1927. 6. Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, L'Oeuvre Complete, Volume II, 1935 (1964 edition) (hereafter OCI); on p.25, the editor wrongly included a section of the Villa Savoye from the drawings of the October 1928 project among the drawings of the building as executed. This mistake has been repeated in virtually every other publication dealing with this house. I have charted the main stages of the design of the Villa Savoye in a Radiovision programme for the Open University Course A305 History of Architecture and Design 1890-1939, programme 17 (1974). The key drawings are reproduced on a fold out sheet accompanying the A305 Radiovision Booklet and can be obtained from the Open University. 7. Published in the Lugano catalogue, op.cit., p.30, fig.7, along with the first and second floor plans from the same scheme. 8. A perspective of these three houses is illustrated in OCI, 1930 (1964 edition), p.60, bottom. 9. Perspectives of this scheme can be found in OCI, p.60, top. 10. See OCI, p. 140, for perspectives from this scheme. 11. These inconsistencies stem from the pasting-up of small sheets of drawings onto backing sheets during the organisation of the archive. 12. A Seminaire conducted in 1980, leading to an exhibition of redrawn versions of the projects for Le Corbusier's Parisian houses. 13. Not, significantly, the illustrations in OCI, pp. 144-9, but in most other views, including Yerbury's plates in the AA collection. 14. See Lugano catalogue, op.cit., p.35, plate 12. 15. See idem, p.32 and pp.43-4, plates 10 and 11. 16. See Rassegna, op.cit. 50 AA FILES 3</page></plain_text>
