<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOVA ET VETERA. THE QUEENSLAND BLACKFELLOW. Mr. Walter Eoth has written another exceedingly interest ing memoir oil the North Queenslanders1?interesting, at least, to all anthropologists and to many scientific men who &lt;lo not claim that title. In the last of these "bulletins" we saw reason to admire the industry and even the intelligence of the despised " black fellow " exhibited in the discovery, collection, and preparation ? ?of quite a multitude of different kinds of food. In this one the j blackfellow appears to less advantage, credulous, superstitious, mischievous, obscene, all in a childish way. Judged by their ideas as to the origin of man and of other animated beings, these people would no doubt stand very low in the scale. But j their faculty of observation is very keen : thus we find that they know, name, and recognize sundry constellations, in this, respect far surpassing the whites with whom they are in con tact, and even the author himself. This kind' of ignorance has frequently caused the death of white men lost in the bush. ^ Anthropomorphism is earried to the furthest extreme in 'in their beliefs. Thus, Thunder is a personage?the most potent known. Rain also is a personage; though many of. their beliefs respecting it would appear tous quite inconsistent with such a notion. But in truth the reasoning or logical faculty, though conspicuous in the blackfellows' language,; sand in much ?f their practical life, is almost unrecognizable ! in their superstitions and magic. It seems clear that all animated beings were originally iblackfellows. This comes out in most of the folk tales here quoted, and gives to them an extraordinary appearance of folly and absurdity. Thus the galah parrot acquired his ftovely crimson plumage through being struck by a lizard with an adze ; and the bat became blind in consequence of his illicit amours with an eagle hawk, an iguana, and other animals. These stories vary much from tribe to tribe, and are, it may be supposed, the product of individual fancy, and iiot necessarily of any antiquity. Their physiological and psychological notions are not merely crude, but often extremely bizarre and ludicrous. Thus it is hard to believe, even on authority so excellent as that of Mr. Roth, that not only is conception in woman not thought to be necessarily due to copulation, but that the Tally River blackfellows do not admit copulation as a cause 'at all, though they allow that it is so in the lower animals ; nor is the relation of puberty to fecundity recognized. Con ception may arise in various ways ; for example, a baby may be formed from mud or pandanus root by a spirit, and Inserted in a woman thereby. The husband, however, acknowledges a relation of paternity. Their notions about a vital principle are rather complex, and vary in different tribes. It is associated with the heart, the afterbirth (!), the breath, and in some degree with the shadow. Anyhow there is a something, which we should call a spirit, which survives the individual, and that for an inde mnit? period, perhaps for ever, so far as the blackfellow can ?conceive such an idea. Such spirits haunt the forests, and may be friendly or malevolent ; but a blackfellow is afraid of encountering them when alone. A spirit may travel east wards, and in some way develop into a whitefellow. " In many North Queensland dialects the same word does duty for ?a white man and for an aboriginal's ghost." The ear is believed to be the seat of intelligence. In the .TCokoyimidir language, already noted in the British Medical Journal for its logical construction, milk a being the word ior "ear," we have Milka?mul (without), stupid. ? ?dir (with), intelligent, obedient. ? ngamba (closed), or-buntchir (hard), obstinate. r ? ninggal (to sit), listen. ; ? bakal (to dig), persuade. And so forth. -The subject of niedicinev as is the case among most savages and barbarians, is curiously interwoven with that of magic or witchcraft. Where disease and death are not supposed to be occasioned by what rwe call natural causes, but to be, as a tule at least, wilfully produced by enemies, or by medicine men (wizards) at their instigation, there is little room for the development of the, healing art, in which, as we shall pre sently see,?these blackfellOws have made very little advance. In credulity and what may be called hallucinatory power, they would " give points " to the followers of the late Madame Blavatsky. * - ..-- --.?'. Dooming, or bewitching, is usually effected by pointing at the intended victim a quartz crystal or a curious implement called a mangan i. The latter contains a hollow, into which the medicine man is supposed to be able to attract the victim's life-^lpod. Thanatomania is a frequent result. A case is cited m which a doctor died in consequence of being doomed by. a laytnan. But the death of the bewitched one may occur from a great variety of apparent causes^?for ex ample, from snakebite. Diseases and accidents, though usually produced wilfully by the enemy's machinations, may sometimes be referred to the fault of the subject, who may have broken a tapu, or wandered alone in a haunted bush, or committed some other imprudence or breach of rules. Or his parents or children may be in fault. What we should call the actual.practice of medicine is not the special profession of the wizard ; the subject is one of common knowledge in the tribe. The list of materia medica is not a long one. Some of the plants used have probably real value ; and several of them, or their near congeners, are employed in native medicine in India, Ceylon, or Cochin China, for example the Ocimum sanctum, much used in fevers. Some of the external applications used for wounds and sores, appear to be possessed of irritant qualities?the blackfellow never allows a wound to heal by first intention. Blood drawn from a male friend's arm (the posterior ulnar vein) is used externally for various internal pains ; it is also drunk, as are other more disgusting fluids. Bleeding is also used as a remedy for fever, headache, and inflamed joints. From the number of remedies for headache, it would appear to be a common affection, which seems strange ; but one of these remedies is stranger, to wit, beating the patient on the head with a waddy (club). The bite of venomous snakes seems to be by no means always fatal. At Cape Bedford cure is said to be effected by rubbing the excrement of the reptile into the wound ; this sounds not unplausible. Other favourite remedies are sucking, emetics, and an ingenious kind of vapour bath. The author does not mention the wonderfully clever practice of the Dalleeburra tribe, near Hughenden, described by Mr. Robert Christison, who says that the blackfellow will tie a ligature tightly round the limb (almost always the leg), above the wound, and then freely scarify the parts below the lisrature. 1 North Queensland Ethnography, Bulletin No. 5, Superstition, Magic, and Medicine.
