<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hasta-Summa Imperii The Spear as Embodiment of Sovereignty in Rome ANDREW ALFOLDI Venerandae memoriae Hugh Last sacrum PLATES 1-10 Hasta summa armorum et imperii est: this defi- nition1 may come from Verrius Flaccus. It means that the most important weapon in early Rome became the expression of the ruling power. What were the manifestations and consequences of this overwhelming political importance of the spear- ensign? Modern scholarship has not concerned itself very much with the answer to this question. The entry "hasta" is entirely lacking in the register of Mommsen's superb "Staatsrecht" and our great lexical surveys contain relevant data only on the spear of the state auction and on that of the praetor hastarius.2 On the other hand, the whole significance of the problem was long ago revealed by Wolfgang Helbig,3 who was ahead of his time in comparing the archaeological evidence concerning the archaic Roman State with the literary sources. He wrote4 in 19o8: "Wie bei den Franken und Longobarden, war bei den prisci Latini der Speer ein Abzeichen der k6nig- lichen Gewalt. Die hasta symbolisierte in Rom zu allen Zeiten . . . in gewissen Faillen das imperium und stets das iustum dominium, welches letztere im Zivilrechte einen Hihnlichen Begriff darstellte, wie das imperium im Staatsrechte. Da der Begriff des imperium bereits in dem rex verk6rpert war, und es undenkbar ist, dass die R6mer bei dem kon- servativen Prinzipe, welches sie auf dem Gebiete des Staatsrechtes beobachteten, nach dem Sturze des Kd*nigtums fiir jenen Begriff ein neues Symbol eingefiihrt haitten, diirfen wir mit Sicherheit an- nehmen, dass die hasta von altersher zu den Attri- buten der latinischen Kiinige geharte." Unfortunately, Helbig was not able to find any document for this discovery from the age of the Republic. And as he was also convinced that such documents could not have existed, he erroneously supposed-and everyone followed his lead-that the spear as attribute of sovereign power was replaced by a rather short staff, like a marshal's baton or a scepter;5 he thought that only Augustus restored this baton to the original length of a spear and re- newed its old function." The interpretation of the hasta donatica, i.e., the military award for bravery,' by Varro, De gente populi Romani,8 as pura, id est sine ferro seemed to reinforce his assumption. But the irresponsible passion of Varro, the great con- noisseur of the remnants of ancient Roman past, for etymological explanations can easily be disposed of in this case. The denarii of M. Arrius Secundus struck in 43 B.C." with the hasta pura, the corona aurea, and the phalerae show indeed a rod-like spear, yet it has been disfigured through an incor- rect drawing in the survey of E. Babelon (taken from him also in the Dictionnaire des Antiquitis of Daremberg-Saglio) into a commander's baton. And the aurei of the same mint-supervisor, more care- fully executed than the silver, show clearly the triangular point on the top, impossible on a wooden shaft without a metallic spearhead (pl. I, 4); still more strongly accentuated are the spearheads of the hastae purae on the tombstone of a Roman officer from Amastris.1o The existence of such a spearhead of considerable size on the hasta donatica is the easier to understand if we realize that this honorary weapon was never of wood, but always forged of metal."

Polybios who had keen eyes for technical details of warfare was well aware of this; he tried (though unsuccessfully) to catch the exact meaning of this Celtic term.'4 Even if he uses this name for the Roman pilum,"5 the reason for it is that iron was the material of both javelins: ya-rog E'/LfXLov 6Xoo-'80-pov writes Hesychios. Furthermore, the coin-type of M. Arrius Secundus as well as the representation of the spearheads on the tombstone mentioned above reveal through the proportional difference of size between the hasta(e), the corona and phalerae, that no reduction in length existed for the former. The later development of the hasta pura reinforces these results. The attributes and dis- tinctions of the Republic show a hierarchic differ- entiation: the phalerae on the trappings of the general are of gold, those of the nobility of silver; the finger-rings given for bravery are of gold for the aristocracy and of iron for the simple citizen.?6 In a similar way, the silver spears offered to the grandsons of Augustus7 as principes iuventutis imply that the gold would be appropriate only for the princeps himself. It may be that the spear-award distributed to officers from the primi pili upwards"8 was wrought of iron, and that the hasta pura argentea attested in the age of Severus'9 used this precious metal only so late: but, in any case, it was always of metal. The royal staff of the Alban kings is also called a hasta pura by Vergil,20 who seems to hint at a golden spear; whether pura stands for ritual purity as e.g. herba pura,21 or for "of pure metal," since the gaesum was 6Xooo-LSrpov, we do not need to discuss. In any case, it is no baton, but long and strong: ille vides, pura iuvenis qui nititur hasta, Silvius, Albanum nomen .... The supposition of Helbig that the spear-ensign was transformed under the Republic to a marshal's baton, has no foundation whatsoever, as we see now. The gap in the archaeological evidence which pre- vented this great scholar from pursuing the fate of that signum praecipuum of the sovereign power through the course of the Roman history can now be bridged by hitherto neglected or misinterpreted Republican coin-types and by extremely small but no less conclusive representations used on the denarii as mint-marks. The exploitation of this invaluable material for this and other related prob- lems has been made possible for me by the generous help of the American Philosophical Society.22 This new source material links up with the spear-attribute on some imperial monuments of art; and a large group of ornamental spearheads found in the provinces, the "Benefiziarlanzen" of the late Emil Ritterling, are revealed as ramifications of the same token of sovereignty-so also the spear as the basic part of most of the military standards is not independent of this concept. From these later as- pects of the development we shall return to its beginning. First we shall find the idea of sover- eignty of the spear in Rome illuminated by the corresponding implement of sovereignty in early Greece, the royal scepter. Finally we shall try to grasp the magico-religious awe surrounding that most dreadful tool of killing in early Rome, which was never entirely replaced by the juridical interpre- tation of unconditional obedience in the face of the sovereign spear. 12 Polyb. 6.39-3. 13 The whole source material for the gaesum is easily acces- sible in the Thes. 1.

For many later centuries the sword was the vehicle of conquest, but for Greeks and Romans alike the spear preceded it.28 When epic poetry flourished, the expressions of this as 8ovpLKT?7rJ024 were long ago established; and long after Homer, the objects of subjugation were called 8opvKrT77Tr, 8opvaXcbroq and the like. This meant the terrible, but the only possible consequence of victory in war,25 as the poet of the Iliad depicts it: KaL TOTE 8q MEXeaypov EVOVO gTrapaKoLTLS XtLo--ET' oSvpoE#V'-q, KaL o, KCaTrEXov a'CravTa Kr18E0, 0' aVOpco'rOt-L ITEXEL TcV Lo aTV LXCO7. av8pac I &amp; KTELVOVoTL, JT oXLv 8E TE Trvp aiuLaBVVEL, #Iva 8* " XXoL dyovo&amp; flalvt vov?

Also in Rome the spear is the instrument of irrevocable appropriation.2? Prisoners of war were sold standing under a spear: et captivi sub eadem (sc. hasta) veneunt, writes Festus30 and a coin-type of 50 B.c. (pl. 2, 9) gives a pictorial illustration of this.3' The solemn forms of legal procedure, which developed from a contest of arms, employed the concept of imperio subiacere also on the legal transfer of possessions:32 and this happened also sub hasta, as we shall see. On the same ground, the spear became the insigne of the auction executed on behalf of the State: hastae subi- ciebant ea, quae publice venundabant, quia signum praecipuum est hasta.33 In general, the spear was regarded as a signum quoddam iusti dominii.34 This solemn symbol of power does not belong, of course, to the subaltern officials who carried or stuck it in the earth, but to the highest authority in the state. One example will be sufficient to show this: Et si ab hasta-Cicero reproached Antony35- valeat hasta, ... modo Caesaris, non tua.. . Varro- nis quidem Casinatem fundum quis venisse dicit, quis hastam illius venditionis vidit, quis vocem praeconis audivit? ... iam intelleges aliam causam esse hastae Caesaris, aliam confidentiae et temeri- tatis tuae. This interrelation between imperium and spear- ensign is very old. That this ensign belonged to the kings must be postulated from the place where the sacred spears of Mars were guarded; it was not in the temple of Mars, but in the regia, the house of the king, stripped of his power, but not of all his religious duties. Vergil, who knew thoroughly the traditions of earliest Rome, certainly did not invent the idea that the kings of Alba Longa did not carry a scepter, but a hasta pura, as visible sign of their dignity. This is corroborated by the statement of Trogus Pompeius36 on the beginnings of the Roman history: per ea tempora adhuc reges hastas pro diademate habebant. As the Romans themselves declared that all paraphernalia of their own king- ship were of Etruscan origin, it must be pointed out that the kings of the Etruscan populi also pos- sessed this attribute. S. Mazzarino37 has discovered that an archaic tomb-relief from Chiusi38 and a terra- cotta relief from a sanctuary in Velletri39 represent 23 W. Helbig, Mem.

In the case mentioned first (pl. 3, 1) the personality highest in rank-it is difficult to decide whether he is a Republican leader of state, as Mazzarino thinks, or the representative of a moderate concept of monarchy-is sitting between two augurs. In any case the attributes of these dignitaries did not change much even after the transition to a Republican form of government, and that of the most prominent of them is surely in- herited from the monarchy; it is no scepter as Mazzarino thought, but a spear as Enrico Paribeni already correctly described it; our plate shows the spearhead clearly. As this group of magistrates sit on curule chairs in peacetime attire with their attri- butes of civilian rank and dignity, the spear is un- mistakably a badge of sovereign power and has nothing to do with an actual weapon. The broken- up end of the staff of the corresponding personality on the relief of Velletri40 may also have been a spearhead. There is a third representation of Etrus- can royalty with the spear in the hand of the sover- eign, instead of a scepter. I am thinking of the famous wall painting of the tomba Golini (G. Q. Giglioli, L'Arte Etrusca [Milan 1935] pl. 245) where the queen of the nether world is solemnly enthroned with her long scepter fashioned on Greek models, whereas her husband, Hades-Eita, appears with the open throat of a wolf on his head and with the royal spear of the Etruscan ruler in his right hand. The Etruscan king or his Republican substitute from Chiusi with the spear (pl. 3, I) dates from the sec- ond half of the sixth century B.c., i.e. from the epoch when Etruscan kings ruled in Rome.4" During the Republic the gradual differentiation of the once global idea of imperium between the sphere of peace intra pomerium and that of war extra pomerium restricted the use of the spear as expression of the sovereign power to some special functions in the capital, but it remained the signum praecipuum of Roman might always and every- where outside the sacred boundary of the City. An important definition of it as expression of sovereign power is offered by a mint-mark of L. Papius from the years after the death of Sulla. This mint-super- visor, like another, L. Roscius Fabatus, reproduced the images of hundreds of objects as control marks on the denarii in a peculiar way: in order to facili- tate the correct coupling of obverse- and reverse- dies, they earmarked them with the image of a pair of interrelated objects. This correlation helps us to a great extent to grasp not only the typological character of the things depicted, but also the reli- gious, political, etc. sense of them. These representa- tions have not yet been explored systematically.42 I think they have been considered negligible because they are very tiny. But bacilli are still smaller, nay immensely smaller, and nevertheless not negligible factors. Some examples of the military sphere will give an idea of the special character of these double marks. With a vexillum on the obverse goes, in one case, the attacking snake of Juno Sospita (pl. 4, 1-2),4 in another the wolf's throat and skin as head-gear of the standard-bearers (pl. 4, 3-4). With the eagle-standard on the obverse appears the altar of the signa militaria, venerated as divinities (pl. 4, 5-6); with the missile of a ballista, this machine itself; with a barbarian helmet with two horns is coupled a classical one (pl. 4,8); similarly with a long Celtic sword a Celtic war trumpet (pl. 4,9). The square of the leather straps to be applied on the armor with the phalerae appears together with a phalera for the horse-trapping with its mounting (pl. 4,10). The pair, pl. 4,7, show a special spear- ensign discussed later (cf. pl. 5, 1,2,6-8) with a round medallion: as this spear is an attribute, not a weapon, so also must be the round medallion, which is, I think, one of the phalerae on the horse-trap- pings of high-ranking dignitaries. In another case (pl. 5,8), the same peculiar spear-symbol is ac- companied by the outstretched right hand of the imperator, symbolizing the fides data, the guar- antee of legal power. These examples illumi- nate the complementary meaning of the two ob- 40 That this relief has previously been interpreted as an assembly of deities was due first of all to the fact that in front of the seated row of personalities referred to above there are two much smaller standing figures, thought to be worshippers. But the latter do not bring offerings and make no gestures of adoration, and I am following the opinion of Miss Lucy Shoe that the disparity in scale between the standing and sitting men results from the isocephalism characteristic of early archaic art, the inability to represent the seated and standing figures in the same proportion. 41 Cf. P. de Francisci, "Intorno all' origine etrusca del con- cetto di 'imperium.' " StEtr ser. 2, 24 (1955-56) 19 sqq. with the previous literature. The representation of the old Sabine king Titus Tatius with the staff of the judge on the denarii of T. Vettius Sabinus (pl. 2, 8) is not founded on a realistic tradition, but resulted from a romantic glorification of the good old times; cf. also infra n. 44. 42 Cf. the synopsis by H. A. Grueber, BMCRep I (1910o) 371 and 423. 4 Cf. the denarius of L. Procilius, by H. A.

The heart-shaped spearhead is certainly not so big by chance: such an enlarged spear on an elongated shaft was certainly more apt to advertise the presence of the sovereign power than a marshal's baton. The spearheads of the same type (pl. 2,1-4) used on the early silver coinage as the badge of some aristocratic clan or the pictogram of a cognomen"4 could eventually represent the sovereign spear. But the earliest Roman example of this latter occurs on the reverse of the gold series struck in 209 B.c. repre- senting king Latinus holding such an oversize spear-emblem in his right hand, and opposite him Aeneas with a normal spear-weapon far shorter (pl. 6,1-5); the evidence for the identification of both of these individuals will be discussed below. No less instructive is the pictorial rendering of the spear of the sovereign power on the denarii of P. Porcius Laeca (pl. 5,4-5; pl. 9,3) from the end of the second century B.c., hitherto overlooked.4 They advertise the lex Porcia de provocatione which enabled Roman citizens residing in the provinces to appeal to the people, in criminal affairs, against the decisions of a governor. The Roman citizen who does this is standing on the left, as the inscription PROVOCO discloses. The magistrate who duly accepts his announcement holds his right hand over his head, facing him in the middle; his military attire signifies that the action represented happens extra pomerium. Behind this representative of the State stands a viator with the two rods (virgae) of his office in the left hand and with his right hand he raises vertically the spear-ensign of the imperium. We owe two more relevant details of information to this coin-type. First, the spear-ensign was not carried by the possessor of the sovereign power himself, but by his lower ranking subordinate; the idea of the "Vortragslanze" of early medieval Ger- man kings has consequently very old antecedents. Secondly, the restriction of the full military right of disposal to the juridical sphere outside of the sacred boundary of the city in the course of an earlier political evolution compels us to assume that the viator of the men in power carried the spear before them only outside Rome. Since the magis- trate returning to the capital was obliged to take off his paludamentum and to put on the praetexta when he crossed the pomerium, he must also have ceased to be accompanied by the spear "at home." Nevertheless, with the return to monarchy, this discrimination of the two spheres of domi and mili- tiae was sometimes disregarded. Caesar apparently refrained from the use of the sovereign spear in the city46 and preferred to stress the religious symbols of his authority as pontifex maximus and dictator47 The spear-ensign of the imperium is possibly indicated by the staff--sometimes studded with globules48-coupled with a legionary eagle, a vexil- lum and a plough on a denarius of Ti. Sempronius Gracchus, struck for Octavian in summer 43 B.c. and promising land in colonies to the veterans (pl. 5,IO-Ii) who enabled the young pretender to cap- ture the city without bloodshed. The globules, of course, make this staff resemble the scipio, but I do not find any reasonable identification of it other than the symbol of power of Octavian, the initiator or warrant of the deductiones hinted at by the stand- ards and the plough."4 An intaglio of the British Museum (pl. 5,I)5 offers an interesting problem. It shows the head of a youthful man behind which there is a very long 44The scipio on the obverses pI. 2, 5-7, means, I think, the cognomen Scipio, and other parallels are easily available. 45 Grueber, BMCRep. 2 (1910) 301 no. 649 does not mention the spear at all and describes the man behind the commander- in-chief as a lictor holding fasces. E. Babelon, Description his- torique des monnaies de la Rep. rom. 2 (1886) 370 no. 4 gives a completely erroneous description: "Guerrier romain arm6 d'une cuirasse et d'une epke et suivi d'un licteur portant les faisceaux." By the sword he means the spear which is not in the hand of the "warrior," but in that of the viator. E. A. Sydenham, The Coin- age of the Roman Republic (London 1952) 78 n. 571 has "soldier cuirassed standing left with sword (!); behind him lictor holding fasces," obviously copying Grueber, and not having looked at the original. 46 I have found in the Museo Civico of Bologna a concave coin with the heads of Caesar and Octavian which seemed to me to show behind the head of DIVOS IVLIVS the spear in the shape of pl. i0, 6. But I have discovered later an aureus from the same die in the Historical Museum in Basle (E. Boehringer, Der Caesar von Acireale [Stuttgart 1933] pl. 9, 34) which shows that a spear is erroneously combined here with an apex; thus this type may be in fact a forgery of the renaissance. 47 J.

The same curious spear-type appears as a mint-mark on the denarius of M. Volteius M.f. from 81 B.c. (pl. 5,2)52 and on that of L. Papius, struck not much later (pl. 5,7-8), so that we must wonder whether this peculiar spear could not have belonged to a definite magistrate cum imperio (e.g. to one of the praetors). Fortunately, we are in a position to establish the identity of the person who is represented on this sardonyx ringstone. The portrait has exactly the same style as the head of the praetor Livineius Regulus of 42 B.c. (cf. pl. 5,3), though the individual is decidedly different; the short oblique strokes of the hair, the modelling of the face and the cut-out of the neck are perhaps even from the same hand. The Spear as the badge of the imperium, the rudder as the symbol of luck or sign of aspiration to govern, bear witness that we have a leading personality be- fore us. And the very Roman pictorial hint at the name, the asinus, tells exactly who he is. Just at this time, one of the key figures of the triumvirate is C. Asinius Pollio, with his strong army in Spain, consul designatus for 40, to whom, very soon after, Vergil dedicated his famous fourth eclogue. In 42, Pollio was 34 years old, which fits well the age of the gem-portrait.53 This series of well-defined documents on the spear as the badge of the imperium in the Repub- lican epoch completes our evidence, eliminating the lacunae which misled Helbig and his followers. The testimony of two relevant, highly official monetary documents from the Augustan age bear witness to the continuity of the use of the spear- ensign. The first is the denarius of L. Caninius Gallus (pl. 1,2), noticed, but misunderstood, by W. Helbig.54 He interpreted the seat represented as a "Richterbank" and the spear-a very long one, which was no "Kommandostab"-as relating to a subhastatio, or the tribunal of the centumviri, mainly because we know how assiduous Augustus was in assisting the work of the courts and presid- ing over them himself. But the subsellium is de- fined, along with the spear, as an implement of the TR(ibunicia) POT(estas) through the letters in- scribed just on the top of it. And the great scholar overlooked the fact that another coin gives an addi- tional illustration of the same political device.55 This is the denarius of C. Sulpicius Platorinus (pl. 1,3; pl. 5,9) where Augustus and Agrippa are seated on the same subsellium tribunicium placed on a platform ornamented with rostra; their gestures show that they are discussing official matters. At their right, a full-length spear is set up, the globular end of which could be a simplified rendering of the type pl. 5,1 and 2. The spear as summa imperii re- ferring to the tribunicia potestas has a momentous juridical significance. Since Mommsen, the potestas has been carefully distinguished from the concept of imperium. Quite recently, P. De Francisci56 ad- vanced serious arguments to the contrary. We can now reaffirm his view and illustrate the basic fact that the attribution of the function of the tribunes to the Emperor meant power,"5 power even intra pomerium! But besides this expression of potestas, it can be demonstrated that the spear continued to be the emblem of supreme power extra pomerium under the Emperors also. The first proof is offered by one of the reliefs found on the site of the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome, the scene of departure of Do- mitian to the Danube, accompanied by Mars, by his special divine protector Minerva, and by Virtus, further on by lictors and some cohortes praetoriae; the Genius senatus, the Genius populi Romani, with whom are some praetorians staying on in Rome, are bidding him farewell.58 The bearded soldier of the entourage of the departing Emperor, separated from 51 Walters saw a goat in it, but P. Corbett who kindly ex- amined the representation upon my request confirmed my ob- servation: the body of the tiny animal is as clumsy as that of a pony (which is excluded from the Roman iconography), but his long ears prove that only a donkey could be meant. 52 The date is given by the exact repetition of the head of Virtus-Bellona on an aureus of Sulla; cf. A. Alf6ldi, Die tro- janischen Urahnen der Romer, Rektoratsprogramm Basel 1956 (I957) pl. 9, 1-2. Whether the same spearhead is meant with the mint-mark of the denarius (pl. 5, 7) of C. Calpurnius Piso is uncertain; perhaps someone knows another piece which could decide this. 58 Cf. J. Andre, La vie et l'oeuvre d'Asinius Pollion (ttudes et Commentaires VIII) (I949) 9 sqq. 17 sqq. 54 W. Helbig, op.cit. (supra n. 3) 33 sqq. 55 E. Babelon, op.cit. (supra n. 45) 2, 476 no.

Magi59 calls him "sottoufficiale" and rightly observes that the same spearhead occurs on provincial monuments, but he does not see the real significance of the hasta, nor do the other scholars who have discussed this monu- ment after him. Now we have unmistakable proof that this officer does not bear the attributes of his own rank, but those of the monarch. Namely, he does not carry the shield on his right arm in the obvious way, as do his fellow-praetorians, but under the armpit; and the aegis of the divine patron of Domitian on this shield reveals to whom it belonged.60 Thus our man is the spear- and shield-bearer of the Emperor, an indispensable function in those times when the su- preme commander came to such close quarters with the enemy in battle. The consul of the Republic had of course such a courageous and reliable armiger,61 whose duty was latera tegere of his general. This functionary was the virao-irto-qr62 Of Caesar, his shield-bearer, mentioned on the occasion of his defeat at Dyrrachium,62a as in the case of a certain Racilius who latus Cassi tegebat,63 or Dardanus, the lTraTo-7cto-r of Brutus.64 A soldier of Augustus in this role states on his tombstone: merui post classicus miles ad latus Augusti annos septemque decem nullo odio, sine oflensa.65 Under Domitian the prefect of the guard could already be styled sacri lateris custos,66 as later, after Gallienus, the elite of the officers assembled around the Emperor were called protectores divini lateris.67 But besides this honorary and allegoric use of protegere, the armiger, in his practical function, remained beside the ruler in the field; he is represented on an aureus of Elaga- balus (pl. 2,I2).68 On this evidence, we can confidently justify the bearded officer on the Cancelleria reliefs, surely a high-ranking centurio of the praetorians, with the armiger of Domitian. It may be that on the voyage to the frontier the same man was in charge of the hasta belonging to the possessor of the imperium and of his shield: but otherwise two officials must have been entrusted with the care of the spear- attribute and the shield of the Emperor. Now it is an essential fact that the same sort of decorative spears were not only employed to mark the presence of the supreme commander during the profectio, but also during the fighting itself. F. Magi discovered this summa imperil on the two well known reliefs representing Trajan's Dacian wars and later built into the middle archway of the arch of Constantine;69 we reproduce one of them"7 (pl. 7,2; pl. 10, fig. 43). In all these cases the unbroken line of continuity from the Republic to the Empire is attested, but it is nowhere so obvious as on the well known relief of Hadrian from the so-called arco di Portogallo (pl. 8,1).7 The Emperor standing on a suggestus accompanied by the Genius senatus and the Genius populi Romani holds an allocutio as usual upon re- turn to the capital, before entering the city proper,72 i.e. still extra pomerium. By the side of the suggestus stands a military person who holds a spear. This is well ascertained, in spite of a series of restorations.73 A. J. B. Wace7" may have hit the mark in identify- ing him as the trecenarius of the speculatores of the bodyguard. This spear-bearer corresponds icono- graphically exactly to the viator of the promagistrate on the denarius of Porcius Laeca (pl. 9,3)75 Palazzo della Cancelleria in Roma (Bibl.

In the later Republic, as is known to us in a somewhat concrete manner, the competences of the magistrates inside of the sacred precinct of the City and outside of its sphere were, as already stressed, differentiated and separated in a painstakingly exact way. But, as we pointed out previously," though the religious significance of that boundary was as old as the City, yet the juridical discrimination intra and extra pomerium did not emerge with the birth of the Republic, as Mommsen believed, but resulted from a gradual development. To the remnants of the older un- biassed concept of sovereignty which I collected in an earlier paper, must be added the permanence of the spear of sovereignty in the city itself in certain state actions and judicial affairs concerning the right of property and the status of personal free- dom.18 We have already mentioned the hasta of the auctions. The origin of this procedure in the sale of war booty was recognized by the Romans them- selves.'" Sulla still boasted fiercely: est enim ausus dicere hasta posita, quum bona in foro venderet et bonorum virorum et locupletum et certe civium, "praedam se suam vendere." And this happened in the heart of the City, on the forum,"8 in the same way that the possessions of Pompey were sold after Pharsalos pro aede lovis Statoris.8 It goes without saying that the victorious general did not himself undertake such a business; this was done by the quaestor. But even the treasurer did not bother with such minima and sold the whole complex to be auctioned to a speculator (sector) for a round sum. And as the retail sale of the sector was still re- garded as an official transaction,"2 it is to be as- sumed that he was acting under the protection of the sovereign spear. The personal control of the hasta by the war-lord was still less the case in the proscriptions of Sulla when, amongst others, his triumviri coloniis deducendis were largely acting for him,83 with the hasta venditionis; or after the defeat of the Senate by Caesar. During the sojourn of the dictator in Alexandria hasta posita pro aede lovis Statoris bona Cn. Pompei, says Cicero grudgingly, ... voci acerbis- simae subiecta praeconis.4 It is certain that Caesar prescribed this,85 and that his magister equitum Antony implemented his order. But Antony was not in charge of this sectio because he was buying the property of Pompey. Thus, the transaction was carried out voce praeconis, ... exactione quaestoris.86 It is also evident that when the triumviralis hasta"8 was swallowing the fortunes of the proscribed, the three men in power were but rarely present, and still less did the Emperors take charge of such trivial matters in later days. Sub hasta vendere had, there- trate: Varro in Gellius 13.12.4 sqq. In any case, the lex repetundarum 50 (Fontes iuris Rom. I [1941] 95 Riccobono) mentions the viatores of a praetor. 76 Cf. in general C. H. Triepel, Delegation und Mandat imn dflentlichen Recht (Stuttgart 1942). 77 A. Alf6ldi, Der Jriihrimische Reiteradel und seine Ehrenab- zeichen (Baden-Baden 1952) 81 sqq. 78 Ed. Cuq writes in DarSag III 43 A: "Dans la procedure de l'action de la loi par serment, la hasta joue 6galement une r61le symbolique. Les textes en signalent trois applications: io in iure, en matiere rbelle; 20 in iudicio, pour les affaires soumises au tribunal des centumvirs; 30 dans la procedure gracieuse, pour realiser un affranchissement entre vifs." The first and the third case are to be strictly separated from the second which alone has to do with the spear of sovereignty. Though we cannot agree with R. C. Nisbet (IRS 8 [1918] I sqq.) that the festuca in the ceremony of manumissio was originally a stalk of sacred grass, but rather follow W. Helbig (op.cit., supra, n. 3, 87 sqq.) who considered it a "verkiimmerter Ableger der alten h'lzernen hasta"; this rod was never the praecipuum insigne of the im- perium, but the remnant of the violent real strife of old times as well as the alapa or the vis illa civilis festucaria of the simu- lated ceremonial fight for landed property before the praetor (Gell. 20o.o.Io), i.e. a private weapon; the same in the case of the right of rectam hastam ferre as assertion of the privilege of legal servitude (Paulus I. 21 ad edictum in: Dig. 8.3.7). The confusion had already been made by Gaius, Inst. 4.16 who confused the Jestuca, i.e. virga with which the manumitted slave percutitur (Schol. Pers. 5.175; cf. Plut., De sera num. vind. p. 550 B) with the spear of the imperium as he says quasi hastae loco, signo quodam lusti dominii. Nevertheless, these matters could be dealt with and were dealt with in fact sub hasta, as we shall see. 79 Liv. 2.14.1-4. Dion. Hal. 5.34-4. Val. Max. 3.2.2. Plut. Poblicola 19.9-0o. 8so Cic.

This, though a secondary development, also concerned state prop- erty and needed the presence of the spear for the addictio sub hasta. The obligation of the hastam ponere was of course there not only when property was publicly dispersed, but also when a process concerning rights of possession was conducted. Since before the First Punic War no one but the praetor was entitled to adjudge a property and since, on the other hand, the spear survived as a badge of this function until the end of antiquity, we must confidently assume that in those early days the praetor himself fixed the hasta on the forum when deciding such matters. By a happy chance we know the very archaic forms of litigation on landed property of that early epoch. Gellius extracted the description of this solemn act from the writing of a jurisconsult89: Nam de qua [re] disceptatur in iure [in re] praesenti, sive ager sive quid aliud est, cum adversario simul manu prendere et in ea re sollemnibus verbis vindicare, id est 'vindicia.' Correptio manus in re atque in loco praesenti apud praetorem ex duodecim tabulis fiebat, in quibus ita scriptum est: 'si qui in iure manum conserunt.' Sed postquam praetores pro- pagatis Italiae finibus datis iurisdictionibus negotiis occupati proficisci vindiciarum dicendarum causa [ad] longinquas res gravabantur, institutum est contra duodecim tabulas tacito consensu, ut liti- gantes non in lure apud praetorem manum con- sererent, sed 'ex lure manum consertum' vocarent, id est alter alterum ex iure ad conserendam manum in rem, de qua ageretur, vocaret atque profecti simul in agrum, de quo litigabatur, terrae aliquid ex eo, uti unam glebam, in ius in urbem ad prae- torem deferrent et in ea gleba tamquam in toto agro vindicarent. The demonic power of the spear of sovereignty, which we shall discuss below, makes it certain that the hasta posita of the praetor was thought to pre- side over and decide this ordeal, once a bloody duel, later transformed into a ceremony symbolizing a fight between the contestants. Around the middle of the third century B.c. the praetor acquired new aids for the formulation of the verdicts on the right of property. Pomponius9o men- tions the introduction of this innovation between 242 and 227 B.c.: deinde cum esset necessarius magistratus qui hastae praeesset, decemviri in litibus iudicandis sunt constituti."9 As I see it, hastae praeesse has always been interpreted in the later sense, i.e. to preside over the iudicium centumvirale, a court originated only a hundred years later,"9 and so the correctness of the statement of Pomponius has been denied. But I think the obvious meaning of this expression for the early epoch is "conduct the litigation on the property," in all probability under the supervision of a praetor; only a magistratus cum imperio was qualified to decide on legitimum dominium. The same applies to the presidency of the iudi- cium centumvirale constituted in the middle of the second century B.c.93 The badge of this court was the centumviralis hasta,94 centum gravis hasta vi- rorum, the centeni moderatrix iudicis hasta.95 The praetors seem to have been much overburdened with the care of this court, because at the end of the Republic its direction lay in the hands of the proquaestors." This fact must be compared with the imperium given to the men of the same stand- ing in the same epoch in provinces of less impor- tance; these latter display the spear as a sign of their power-the evidence will be given below; this convergence intra and extra pomerium is due to no chance, it seems to me. The first princeps was constrained to lower again the rank of the presidents of the centumviral court, entrusting it to the decemviri stlitibus iudicandis97 who were also called X vir ad hastam.98 But at the same time, Augustus seems to have reestablished the 88 E.g. Liv. 4-29.4. 89 Gell. 2o.o0.6-1o. 90 Dig. I pt. 2. 2.29. The first epigraphical mention of the decemviri is from 139 B.c. (CIL VI I296: Dessau 6), but the extreme scarcity of inscriptions forbids the use of this as an argument for the late origin of this magistracy. 91 Cf. Kiibler, RE 4, 2260 sq. 92 Mommsen, R6m. Gesch.

It is essential for our problem that each of the decemviri presiding over the single chambers con- stituted ad hoc by the praetor hastarius had an up- right spear of his own. This follows from the fact that when the centumviral judges were split into two parts, these were called duae hastae.102 It is no- where explicitly stated, but is obvious that in the case of a quadripartition of the centumviri, normally practised by complicated litigations on heredity, four hastae distinguished the four tribunals, though all of them had their sessions in the basilica lulia in the imperial epoch.103 The role of the praetor hastarius over these special judicial committees is clearly defined in a letter of the Younger Pliny1o*: Descenderam in basilicam luliam auditurus, quibus proxima comperendina- tione respondere debebam. Sedebant iudices, decem- viri venerant, obversabantur advocati; silentium longum, tandem a praetore nuntius. Dimittuntur centum viri, eximitur dies me gaudente .. hoc facto Nepotis (sc. praetoris qui legibus quaerit) commotus praetor, qui centumviralibus praesidet, deliberaturus an sequeretur exemplum, inopinatum nobis otium dedit. In spite of the complete right of control by the praetor, the praecipuum insigne was delegated to his subalterns and consequently was multiplied in the same way as by public sales of property. The mandatory role of the spear as emblem of power is still more obvious in the provinces where the government never lost its original character of conquest, the sign of which was the hasta. There is a group of late Republican coins of proquaestores who display the spear with their sub- sellium and fiscus."05 Helbig realized that the spear, which could not be used normally by a quaestor, who did not possess the imperium, as a badge of his office, denotes in the case of the proquaestores of the first century B.c. that they have been invested with some sort of independent governing capacity. We know three such cases: a) The small silver quinarius of L. SESTIus PROQuaestor (pl. 1,5) was struck in Macedonia in 43-42 B.C.'06 Though the obverse shows the name of Brutus as proconsul, the comprehensive character of his imperium maius allowed him to admit the hasta as sign of the restricted power of his sub- ordinate. b) Bronze coins of the quaestor pro praetore A. Pupius Rufus in Cyrene'07 struck in the years im- mediately following Actium (pl. i,io-ii) display the same array of attributes. It has been observed from Longperier on that the spear originally be- longed to the praetorial imperium. c) The anonymous bronzes pl.

He thinks that the coins pl. 1, 8-9 with the same head, inscribed PRINCEPS FELIX only imitate the portrait of the anonymous issue, struck in Thessalonica in his opinion, and that they were struck in Asia Minor. He reads the monogram on them as ALE(X)andria. But the smaller anonymous speci- men, pl. 1, 7, shows clearly that the peculiar style of the de- teriorated portrait with PRINCEPS FELIX originated in the</page><page sequence="11">1959] HASTA-SUMMA IMPERII 11 of a colonia lulia secundorum urbanorum (veter- anorum?) with other types (pl. 1,8-9) calling Oc- tavian PRINCEPS FELIX."'9 So we have to do with a phenomenon of the decades of the transition between Republic and Empire. The use of the hasta by proquaestores may mirror the same aspirations of unimportant figures using the title of imperator in the provinces, as we know from the literary sources, until this deprecia- tion of the supreme might was barred by the mo- nopoly of the ruler. At this time the prefects of the camps had a certain peculiar spear, stuck in the earth as the badge of their position in the field. This is at- tested by Livy10O for the year i I B..: in Germania, in castris Drusi examen apium in tabernaculo Hostili Rufi, praefecti castrorum, consedit ita ut fu- nem praetendentem praefixamque tentorio lanceam amplecteretur. We are able to push our ideas on the hasta as em- blem of sovereign power a step further through the inclusion of a group of decorative spearheads, dis- covered in the ruins of military establishments of the frontier provinces (pl. Io, figs. 1-2), classified and interpreted by E. Ritterling in an admirable paper"' and supplemented with new material in another brilliant study by G. Behrens"2 who dis- covered that besides the original spearheads and their representations on tombstones, there exists a rich series of miniature spears used as a device on fibulae, or as ornamental mountings on leather, as well as hanging ornaments. Sculptured tombstones enabled Ritterling to recognize that these spears belonged to certain ranks of subordinate officials, to the beneficiarii consularis,"' speculatores,'14 (pl. 9,2), frumentarii,'15 etc. Ritterling also perceived that the group of officials in question belonged to the staff of the provincial governors."' He thought that the standard-like spears were the attributes of these staff-officials and, though this proves to be wrong, he established the important fact that these spear-ensigns were carried anywhere where orders of the governor were to be carried out outside his headquarters."' A striking illustration of this fact is given by the tombstone of a speculator in Belgrade (pl. 9,2). He is certainly not making a tour of in- spection, as has been supposed, but is acting in matters concerning the right of property, e.g. requi- sition of food, vehicles, etc., for the army, eventually enforcing the payment of duties. The spear-ensign of his function is carried by his servant, accompany- ing him on his trips, announcing thereby the state intervention. As the Roman antecedents of these spear-types were unknown to him and, on the other hand, the evident discrepancy between them and the tactical standards of the Roman army did not escape his attention, Ritterling saw in these stand- ards derivatives of the standards of Hellenistic re- ligious associations.118 But we know now that the big heart-shaped spearhead of Vdssingen (pl. 10, fig. 7) with its greatly elongated rodlike point developed from the same type as that of Pollio (pl. 5,1-2; pl. io, fig. 6); we know equally that the two oblique incisions on both sides of the spearheads of those staff-officials (pl. 10, figs. 13-I5) are also on the imperial spear- attribute of Domitian (fig. 18); furthermore we saw that large standards with two superimposed big ornamental spearheads such as that of the beneficiarius consularis from Wiesbaden (pl. io, fig. 42) were also employed in the Dacian battles of Trajan, just behind the fighting area-as it seems to me, in the presence of the Emperor himself (pl. 7,2; pl. io, fig. 43). In view of all this evidence same mint as the pieces pl. I, 6-7 with Q(uaestor): i.e. the same mint coined state and local issues. The style, as well as this double function, could very well fit a date just after the battle at Actium. 109 The legio II urbana was one of the civil wars. H.

It is likely that the material and execution of the spear carried before the Emperor was more precious than those of the subordinates: the hierarchy of metals was well established in the Rome of the Republic for such a use."9 Beside this the letters B-F on the representation of such an ensign in Lyon (pl. io, fig. 12) prove that the rank of the officials to whom it was attributed was clearly indicated; whereas the tabulae ansatae of these standards with the names of the men indicate rather the same prac- tice as marked the possession of the State on weapons and other military property. It seems also that some differentiation between the spear-emblem of the magistrates had developed already in the late Republic: the long spearhead of Asinius Pollio (pl. io, fig. 4) could be perhaps the spear-standard of the praetor used intra pomerium. Nevertheless the typological congruence of the spear, borne before the monarch and the governors as well as before insignificant subaltern officials, points to a remarka- ble fact: it is a striking visual illustration of the idea of the global unity of the imperium amidst its manifold applications, stressed e.g. by E. Leifer and cherished by the eminent scholar and beloved friend to whom this paper is dedicated. Later research will certainly establish an evolu- tion in the shape and decoration of the spear as badge of power. The big heart-shaped spearheads of the Republican imperators (pl. io, figs. 1-3) ap- parently had no elaborate decoration. The lateral incisions known from the first century A.D. (pl. 10, figs. 13-18) seem to be replaced by the "eyes" on the spearheads of the Middle Empire (pl. io, figs. 19- 27, 31-41). A variety of this insigne with a double spearhead occurs under Trajan (pl. io, figs. 42-45). But we must limit our actual survey to these few general hints at the present. THE SPEAR OF THE TACTICAL signa Apart from the eagle and a few other sacred animals on the top of the signa of the pre-Marian army, and besides those with the raised hand, all the military standards of the Roman army were nothing other than spears with a great variety of additional secondary features, a fact the importance of which has not yet been realized.120 The dona militaria of the troops, such as wreaths, paterae, clipei, decorate their standards, sometimes even surround the spearhead; but they are, even then, nothing else but spears of the legionsl21 (pl. io, figs. 8-9), as well as of the cohortes praetoriae.'22 Very clearly also the standards of the auxilia are spears: we illustrate this only with the signum of Pintaius"l2 (pl. 9,1; pl. io, fig. I7), and mention as another example that of Oclatius."24 It may be assumed that in all those cases the spear meant power and command.125 It was gilded"l2 to catch the eyes of the soldiers who got the tactical orders through the signa and their movements. But at the same time, this visible expression of imperium was due to be split as many times as there were units. The flag-standards illustrate this perhaps best. The Roman vexillum is nothing other than a spear with a square piece of cloth just under the spearhead.'27 The vexillum was the standard of every detached troop-unit,"28 but other flags ex- isted, too, which are not discussed in detail in the fundamental treatise of A. v. Domaszewski, Die Fahnen im romischen Heere. To be sure, we must also mention with the cate- gory of the vexilla another kind of signum which also had a cloth-flag on it. This square piece of cloth 119 Alf6ldi, op.cit.

Such were the standards of the manipuli reproduced on the denarii of C. Va- lerius Flaccus and the Pompeian consuls of 49 B.c. (pl. I,I and pl. Io, fig. 46; cf. also pl. 5,Io-II) with the abbreviated inscriptions H(astati) and P(rin- cipes). Similar standards appear as mint-marks on the denarii of L. Papius and C. Roscius Fabatus (pl. 4,I-4 and pl. Io, fig. 48); on denarii of 43 B.c. (pl. 5,10-11) the same flag-standard belongs to veteran colonists. There existed another sort of vexillum, bigger than the others, carried on a longer pole, with the name of the supreme commander and of the (expedi- tionary) army in purple letters on it.129 Such is the banner towering over the legionary signa on a re- lief-scene of the column of Trajan.130 A. v. Domas- zewski131 and with him A. v. Premerstein'32 thought that these great vexilla were not employed on the march and in the battle, but were used only in camp and decorated the tent of the commander- in-charge; but the description of such a banner of the army of Crassus"3 concerns the army in move- ment. On the other hand, the vexillum of the su- preme commander,134 different from these big banners, was also employed in the fighting. As just mentioned, besides these great banners, there was also a special one belonging to the im- perator himself. Examples of this must be seen in the vexillum carried before the standards of the imperial bodyguard on Trajan's column135 or dis- played with the Emperor on the column of Marcus Aurelius. This flag of the supreme commander was displayed in the praetorium ordering the state of readiness for battle,1'6 but it was also used to give the signal for the start of the fighting,"'37 both on land and for the beginning of a naval action.8"" The hoisting of this belli signum was very old; the con- vocation of the popular assembly by the same act also signifies the same will of the sovereign power.'39 The necessity of having this purple flag always at hand for the purpose of tactical commands140 ex- plains why it was not deposited in the shrine of the signa, but was kept at night in the dwelling of the commander-in-chief.141 The flag of the generalis- simo had a purple coat,142 and when Augustus hon- ored Agrippa with a caeruleum vexillum after the victory of Naulochos, it was a first step towards the Byzantine hierarchy of colors,143 in the same way as 129 Cass.

(Cf. the note on different interpretations in the edition of H. Furneaux, The Annals of Tacitus I2 [London 1896] 232). As the veterans had no special role in the upheaval, we cannot assume with v. Domaszewski (supra n. I20) 25, that the vexillum in the house of Germanicus was theirs: I do not see why their vexillum would not have been deposited with their commander if not in the sacrarium of the signa. As there is evidence that the mutiny intended to elect a new general (Tac. Ann. 1.43.2), the transfer of the purple flag to this person must be connected with this act of the rebels. 142 Plut. Fab. 15.1 and Brut. 40.5 (quoted supra n. 136). Cf. Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Gordiani, 8: sublata de vexillis purpura.

If the flag with HIS(pania) on the denarii from 54 B.c. referring to C. Coelius Caldus, proconsul in Spain ca. 98 B.c.145 is his purple ensign, as we think, this flag also had the globular protuberances on its shaft, as the manipular standard had; in this case the mint-marks of the denarii from the seventies of the last century B.C. (pl. 4,1-4) could mean this purple vexillum. No doubt this is the flag in the hand of Victory on the coins celebrating Actium,"46 in the hand of Mars on coins commemorating the departure of Augustus with an expedition,'4" or the journeys of Hadrian on the sea.148 This imperial flag was replaced by Constantine with his labarum. The hasta was used also as standard of the manipuli. The ancient writers explain its origin as a handful of hay, bound to a pole:'"" pertica suspensos portabat longa maniplos, Ovid describes it.'50 We see the simplest form of this ensign re- produced as mint-mark on the obverse of a denarius of C. Valerius Flaccus (pl. I,i and pl. 1o, fig. io); the globules on the shaft are only slight, and the tassel under them, always present on the manipular and many other standards, could preserve the form of the original bunch of hay. In view of the magico- religious atmosphere out of which these standards emerged, we agree with L. Renel151 that this hay must have been something like the sacred sagmenta, taken from the Capitol for ritual purposes. In fact, the primary role of the hasta as the kernel and essence of the standards is not due to any practical consideration. It is well known that not only the eagle had its own cult (and before Marius the horse, man-headed bull, boar and wolf) but the other standards too.152 We are reminded of two famous passages of Tertullian who testifies to this in full detail: Religio Romanorum tota castrensis signa veneratur, signa iurat, signa omnibus deis praeponit. Omnes illi imaginum suggestus in signis monilia crucum sunt; siphara illa vexillorum et cantabrorum stolae crucum sunt.'53 And again:'"' itaque in Victoriis et cruces colit castrensis religio, si signa adorat, signa deierat, signa ipsi lovi praefert: sed ille imaginum suggestus et totius auri cultus monilia crucum sunt. Sic etiam in cantabris atque vexillis, quae non minore sanctitate militia custodit, siphara illa vestes crucum sunt. When in the case of extreme peril the tumultus was proclaimed, the oath of the hastily assembled army was taken collectively before a vexillum as the divine witness of the coniuratio.55 The same act is often represented as the coniuratio of the peoples of Italy in the Social war (pl. 6,5-6, and pl. Io, fig. 47). Here the same oath is sworn in front of a huge pole of the same type as the Roman manipular standards, with a flying ribbon on its top, exactly as on the Roman parallels (pl. i,i and pl. io, fig. 46) 156 THE SPEAR AS SOVEREIGN IN ROME AND THE SCEPTER AS RULING POWER AMONG THE MYCENAEAN GREEKS The spear of sovereignty has its personality and still in imperial times it is characterized by expres- sions which depict it as an acting individual. When Valerius Maximus mentions the hastae iudicium157 or the Laus Pisonis"5S has trepidos ad iura decem citat hasta virorum et firmare iubet centeno iudice causas, or Statius159 speaks of the centeni modera- trix iudicis hasta or Juvenals10 calls this spear domina hasta, it is not a rhetorical artifice but re- 144p.

Similarly, when Mar- tial1" writes: hunc miratur adhuc centum gravis hasta virorum, when Senecal62 mentions hastam (Caesaris) consularia spolia vendentem and Gaius1s6 declares that in centumviralibus iudiciis hasta prae- ponitur-still other examples could be added easily -all this reveals the queer notion of the spear who acts as an active supreme ruler: a personified force on a superhuman level. This cannot be separated from the ritual imprecation of the sacred spears by the holder of the imperium leaving for a war. These spears were guarded in the regia and regarded as containing the might of Mars himself. They were addressed by the leader of the State with the words: Vigilasne Mars? Vigila! In the same way, this con- cept cannot be isolated from the spear in the sanc- tuary of Jupiter Feretrius which witnessed and warranted the solemn act of the foedus from time immemorial,'64 as we shall see. The spear of the legal authority in Rome which is obeyed as an animated being, but which is at the same time the materialization of the abstract idea of power, has a striking analogy in the scepter of the Mycenaean kings, the role of which is clearly mirrored in the Iliad, but which is vanishing in the fairy-tale world of the Odyssey,"65 prolonging the epics into a period in which the kingship was dying away. To have the legal authority in public affairs, even the king is obliged to take into his hand the scepter, a sacred object, a unique gift of the gods. Agamemnon seizes the scepter of his ancestors, "imperishable ever," when he assembles the Achae- ans;8' he holds it when haranguing his people.7"' The herald brings the scepter to King Menelaos on a similar occasion."s When administering an oath, the king raises the scepter towards heaven showing it to all the gods, no doubt as warrant of the hon- esty of his intentions.169 When the king wants to authorize someone to act in his name, the means of authorization is to hand the scepter over to him. Agamemnon does so when he entrusts authority to Odysseus, who addresses them by holding the royal staff,170 calling back the fleeing Achaeans from the ships,"' or when he sends the same hero to Troy.172 It was indispensable for the administration of justice to hold the scepter upright; it was above all the symbol of justice"" already in the ancient Near East. If the king himself acted as a judge, he did it with his scepter in his right hand;"17 if he delegated this power to others, the scepter was handed over to them in turn.175 This delegation of power became an empty ceremony in the Attic democracy where the judges nevertheless held a long staff as a badge of sovereign rights.176 This Greek tradition seems to have affected the Romans of later times who imagined their old kings with the staff in the hand, as judges; such a representation appears on the denarius of T. Vettius Sabinus (pl. 2, 8) where Titus Tatius is depicted with the scipio.77 The continuity of this token of the supreme authority in the Middle Ages cannot be discussed here, of course."178 161 Martial 7.63.7. 162 Sen.

Aen. 12.206 (cf. 2.2 and 2.6) is a naive attempt to explain the presence of the "scepter" as a pars pro toto, i.e. as a vicegerent instead of the cult-image: this cult never had a cult-statue.

But the king can entrust his her- ald with important missions, and again he authorizes his envoy by lending him the o-Kn-r7pov. No doubt the reverence with which the angry Achilles greets the heralds of Agamemnon'so is due only to the scepter carried by them,'s' in the same way as the heralds of the Trojans and the Achaeans supervise the duel of the mighty heroes, Hektor and Aias, with their undisputed orders, after they pE'o--crp '" d,0bor',pCov o-KjTrrpa (i.e. the respective staffs of their kings) o-XE'OOV.182 Here we must stress the fact that the long O'rKcrTTpov in the hand of the public heralds be- longs to their kings and has nothing to do with their own short rod (afip'0o), 18 though these two things are often confused.'84 The herald's staff is the same as the wand of their prototype Hermes, the divine envoy of Father Zeus.'85 When Poseidon strikes both the Aiases, he does not use a scepter, but a magic rod, a 0-KrrTa'vLov;186 Athene also has such a piP8o0 in the Odyssey."'7 The ancient au- thors realized this difference; Polygnotos, in the Lesche of Delphi, painted Agamemnon leaning with his right arm on the long royal staff, but hold- ing also a twig;'8s in the Gorgias of Plato, Minos as king has the golden scepter, yet his fellow-judges in the nether world have only rods. It is essential to realize through this parallelism that the scepter had a different origin from the sorcerer's rod. I think we find attributes both of the ruler and the herald on a well known monument of the i6th century B.c., namely the steatite cup (pl. 8,2) from Hagia Triada in Crete.'89 The king holds out his staff, extending his right arm with an emphatic gesture towards a young men. Though this latter has a helmet on his head, he does not have the main weapon of those days, the spear. The staff with a round globule at the lower end, which he has in his right hand, has been considered to be a sword. Indeed, an officer of our days, reporting to his superior, would hold his sword in this way. But this staff is not a Mycenaean sword with its broad blade, but merely a stick. And, since the man who holds it has no spear, the absence of the main weapon makes the absence of the secondary one plausible.'Y0 The strongly emphasized importance of the upright scepter exhibited by the king9"' corresponds to the role of the royal staff among the Achaeans of Homer, as does the role of the an- nouncer with his rod who leads to his sovereign three men carrying gifts or bringing him tribute, exactly in the way the Iliad depicts it: Ev 8' d'vpEE vaLovo 'nokXVpprYVE9 roXV3o0r7av , ot KE 8E 07WL0L o OErP 60 9tLCrOOVLrtV KatL OL VrTO OK-r7rrTpcp X rapd7 7TIEOUVtL fTWTTa1 The helmet of the herald could well be Myce- naean Greek"19 and even the Cretan features of the costume would not exclude the possibility of Greek origin.

It was cer- tainly used down to the destruction of the site which is contemporary to the destruction of the other Minoan towns and palaces. Being an object not easily breakable, it may have been in use for a long time. It certainly belongs to the Minoan strati- fication, i.e., before the LM III occupation of the site. If you read the study I wrote before Ventris' interpretation of Linear B, 'I1 sentimento della natura nell arte Minoica e Micena,' FEpaC 'Avrjvin'ov KEpaco7qrovXXov, Athens 1953, 119-127, you may read that I considered it (p. 123) to be imported from Cnossos, and belonging to the LM II trend of Cnossian art. At the time, I had no idea that LM II style belonged to a period of Greek occupa- tion at Cnossos. You may see in this study that I had already noticed that Cnossian LM II was very near to the Greek mainland art and already showed the Greek classical spirit and characteristics. Ventris' interpretation completely confirmed my feeling. Now, knowing that Greek was written at Cnossos in LM II, my opinion on the H. Triada cup is that it was made at Cnossos during the Greek occupation and imported to H. Triada just before the LM I b destruction of the site." Therefore, everything speaks for the Greek char- acter of this scene. As in Homer, also on the rhyton of H. Triada the scepter carries the supreme might; even the king cannot act legally without it, its pres- ence is the preliminary to all political actions. It is an eternal incorporation of sovereignty, similar to the banniere de France which is only slightly lowered when a king is buried and then erected again, because "la banniere de France ne meurt pas."'5 But whence comes this individuality, this superhuman vigor and supposed perpetual life of an inanimate object? Epic poetry preserves the answer to this question which, no doubt, reflects the real religious sanction of Mycenaean kingship. Agamemnon's scepter in the Iliad"19 is a masterpiece of art wrought by Hephaistos in heaven at the command of Zeus. Zeus sent it by Hermes to the founder of the dy- nasty of the Pelopides, whose rulers transmitted it to each other in their turn. So this scepter, irarpcJov b00Lrov alE"97 came down to the actual ruler "that so he might be the lord of many isles and of all Argos." It is the token of the sanction of the king by the supreme god'98 and no one but the o-K7rr- ro70Xo can be the legitimate ruler.'99 The visual expression of this investiture of the king with the symbol of power is the eagle, Zeus' envoy, sitting on the scepter.200 Conceptions of Near-Eastern king- ship, transmitted by the Minoans to the early Greek rulers seem to me to have engendered this argu- ment. But all this does not explain the necessity of having the staff; it is superfluous to document the approval of Zeus in the sense of Homeric myth- ology where the God-father either sends personal envoys to the kings dear to his heart, or visits them in person. It is obvious that the staff already had its decisive role when the myths in question were created, a role older than the Olympian gods. We know another long staff, the Roman hasta, as the incorporation of the sovereign power. We saw that the spear representing the ruling power is stuck in the earth20' and sub hasta, i.e. under the sway of the spear, legal auctions are carried out.202 Sub hasta, "under the upright spear" corresponds exactly to the action i`r- o'K-K1Trrpc among the early Greeks. We have already quoted the expression Vro oKr-K7TrTp&amp; X1Trap&amp;, TEXEOvo- lOELcr-rao from the Iliad203 in which we read also:204 ZEvb ydp ot vir ToK7-Trrpy C~ E8LLao-E'v.

Furthermore, we possess some evidence for the spear as the sign of sovereign power in Greece. The earliest proof for this would be the display of epic heroes on the fragment of a proto-Attic krater from the first half of the seventh century B.c. (pl. 8,3).*209 Though in richly embroidered long robes, Menelaos and all his companion-kings carry a long spear. The Odyssey, however, knows the use of the spear by the Achaeans also on political occasions (irakXp q e8 E XaXKEov y jXO, Od. 2.10). The procession on this vase could represent a gathering before Troy, i.e., the spear could be meant-in spite of the peace- ful attire of its bearers-as being carried on the field of battle. But there is more unimpeachable evidence, too. Euripides210 says of Polymestor: tlhXrrov Xadv Eb'Ovcov 8opl, where the spear is the wtvvr"pov instead of the scepter; as in Rome, litigation in early Greece seems to have been a miti- gated form of a contest with arms. Theopompos211 states this: X6yx 8e ~ rapcrl.ov apxr Ka&amp; 8vva- moretal. The magistrates of the cities Meliboia and Skotussa wiped out by Alexander of Pherae are called 8opv0b'poo212 and also the Theban magis- trates had the spear as attribute of their office.213 The traces of the cult of the royal spear discussed below point in the same direction. It seems there- fore that though the Cretan influence replaced the sovereign spear by the sovereign scepter in Myce- naean Greece, the original conception reappeared in Hellas after the arrival of the Dorians. Trogus Pompeius writes on the beginnings of Rome:214 per ea tempora adhuc reges hastas pro diademata habebant, quas Graeci 'sceptra' dixere; he may be right in the sense hinted at. THE OCCULT POWER OF THE RAVAGING SPEAR The prehistoric notion that the deadly effect of a spear-thrust does not derive from the force of the men who drove it, but from the immanent "mana" which is hidden in the weapon, is manifest in Rome::21 nam et ab origine rerum pro diis immor- talibus veteres hastas coluere.216 Varro thought in this sense that the hastae preserved in the regia must be reduced to one, incorporating Mars.2"' The state- 206 A.

(n. 217) wrongly accepts the exist- ence of only one spear in the regia which induces him to identify this spear with the one on which stood the man who vowed the self-sacrifice of the devotio. Neither is be right in confusing the spear of the fetiales with the hasta Martis: in this latter case the sympathetic magic of the spear-throwing action is essential, not the individual weapon. Schwenn thinks that the hasta Martis was taken into the field by the pontifex maximus. I find no evidence for this assumption.</page><page sequence="19">1959] HASTA-SUMMA IMPERII 19 ment found in several authors, that the god Qui- rinus is so called because quiris-curis means "spear" in the Sabine tongue, is embedded in a series of inconsistent combinations which also have the flavor of the style of Varro and no doubt come from him;218 the corresponding interpretation of luno Quiritis' name has no different origin.219 Consequently, though it is obvious that the in- herent magic power of the spear has in some way been brought into connection with the two war- lords of early Rome, the wolf-god Mars and the boar-god Quirinus,220 the exact nature of this relation is somewhat obscured by the arbitrary re- duction of the hastae Martis to one.221 Nevertheless, the broad concept of the supernatural virtues of the spear, not restricted to a unique specimen of heav- enly war-lords or to a single spear of ancient fame, was most deeply rooted in Rome. The plurality of the sacred spears in the sacra- rium, a small cabinet close to the living quarters of the pontifex maximus in the regia, is exactly trans- mitted to us by the lists of prodigia in Livy, of highly official provenience.222 The belief in the radiating immanent power of these sacred spears has been well elucidated by H. Wagenvoort.223 He stresses the fact224 that the careful observation of the spontaneous motion of the hastae Martis which originally, no doubt, foreboded an imminent war, reveals an archaic numen-belief, older than the per- sonal and anthropomorphic divinity of Mars. Be- sides the spontaneous movement of the hastae Martis at the beginning of the war, the king and his successors respectively undertook the magic ritual to propitiate the numinous power of the spears in action. Here it becomes apparent that the "mana" was not confined to one sacred spear, nay, not even to all the sacred spears; since the ominous movement of the spears occurred and was keenly observed also with the sacred shields,225 the com- mander of an army moves not only the spears of Mars, but also the shields. Servius mentions this twice: . .. is qui belli susceperat curam, sacrarium Martis ingressus primo ancilia commovebat,228 post hastam-(recte: hastas!227) . . . dicens "Mars vi- gila"227a and again: nam moris fuerat indicto bello in Martis sacrario ancilia commovere.228 With these expressions of the ritual language Servius rightly explains Vergil's words:229 Mos erat ... in Latio, quem protinus urbes Albanae coluere sacrum, nunc maxima rerum Roma colit, cum prima movent in 218 Dion.

But Servius feels correctly, too, that, when Turnus starting the battle had impulit arma, this means the same magic compulsion.230 Still more obvious is this magic character of action by Turnus in Aeneid 12.93 sq.: validam vi corripit hastam, . . . quassatque trementem, vociferans: "nunc o nunquam frustrata vocatus hasta meos, nunc tempus adest." The same atmosphere is mir- rored rather often by other poets. Valerius Flaccus231 describes the pause for breath in a heroic contest as fixa silet Gradivus in hasta, and the raging of war as pugnas mota pater (sc. Gradivus) incitat hasta.232 The same is expressed by Statius233 with cumr Odrysiam Gradivus in hastam surgeret, and by Silius Italicus with quassat per auras . . . hastam (Mavors).2" The ancilia235 and the hastae Martis stayed in their shrine in Rome, serving the defense of the city itself; they should avert evil and watch over the city.236 But, as the quotations just given show clearly, the same complex of magic ideas was at work when the might of the spear was desirable for the purpose of the offensive. We must stress the importance of the fact, emerg- ing from our discussion, that the occult force immanent in the spear was not bound to a single god or a single venerable weapon, but was supposed to be at work almost everywhere where the hasta was carried. This elucidates how the spear as the skeleton of the standards could have a religious touch everywhere and also how the mandatory use of the spear as summa imperii was prepared by this magic concept, paving the way for the juridical expression of sovereignty for the awe-inspiring power of the dreadful tool of slaughter."2 Not less important for our problem is the well-established fact that the kings had already watched over the sacred spears of Mars; no one will doubt that they were deposited in the regia before the rex sacrificu- lus took over from the real king the duty of watch- ing their behavior. H. Wagenvoort made it plausible that the concept of the imperium has something to do with the notion of the "mana." He thinks238 that imperium meant originally "chief's mana," imperare to trans- fer "mana," and imperator the "chief who transfers mana." The archaic notion of the felicitas impera- toris239 proves that the general in charge was sup- posed to have such a magic power; but, beside this stood the hasta incorporating the imperium. The fact that the spear was carried before the king or commander, and not by him like all his other regalia, was originally due to this self-sufficient power of the spear. This custom and belief must be pre-Etruscan;240 as the hasta as attribute in the hand of the Etruscan king of Chiusi (pl. 3,1) sug- gests, the Etruscan kings introduced the royal spear-attribute in Rome, which must be distin- guished from the sovereign spear. THE DIVINE SPEAR PRESIDING OVER THE OATH We return now to the oath-scene on gold coins which were struck, as is today unanimously ac- cepted, in the second half of the Punic war (pl. 6, 1-4). A bearded old man of imposing stature, naked to the waist and clad only in a skirt, holds the sign of the imperium, a very tall spear; facing him, a younger man stands in a cuirass, with a shorter spear and a mantle on the left arm. Both point with their drawn swords to a pig held by a youth kneel- ing between them.241 At this period, realistic repre- sentation of a contemporary event is not yet pos- sible; such an allusion would have been pictured only through scenes of myth and legend.242 Thus an oath taken by an actual imperator from a soldier is out of the question; and as the imitation of the types a hundred years later (pl. 6,7-8) puts the two main figures on an equal footing, we must focus our attention on federal oaths in the Rome of legendary times to which these two men certainly belonged. But why is the old man half-naked and the young one in armor? The bearded Titus Tatius with the younger Romulus could in no case be pictured in such utterly different attire. But there is another solution easily at hand. I have proved in an earlier 230 Serv. Aen. 8.3- 231 Val. Flacc. Argon. 4.279-281. 232 ibid. 4.609. 233 Stat. Achill. 1.485 sqq. 234Sil. Ital.

The picture of this alliance is well known and often reproduced, as the occurrence of this composition on engraved gems shows.244 The preliminaries given above reduce the identification of our federal oath of ancient times to only one possibility. The mighty old representative of the autochthonous ancestors of the Romans is king Latinus, as Vergil depicts him on the ground of the myth-historical tradition in the Aeneid: he is iam senior245 or rather longaevus rex,246 maximus aevo Latinus,247 the venerable pater . . . . Latinus.248 He is of great stature, ingenti mole.249 The younger man, armed in Greek fashion, is Aeneas. We know well how Trojans and Achaean heroes were confused in Italic legend as mutual friends and founders of cities, and there was a tradi- tion which stressed the "Greek" appearance of Aeneas, clearly preserved, e.g. by Dionysios of Hali- karnassos. King Latinus recognizes the newly ar- rived Trojans nCOrkXo-Ivovq rE wq 'EXXqvap,250 and some divinity persuades him in a dream 8xEco-OaL ,roOq EXXYvaCg 70r opvq x voKOv4;251 nay, Aeneas himself tells him, they have come from Troy, r6d- XEco 8 7E ov fq1agavEcrTa77 sv 'EXXlyo-w.252 So this is the famous foedus aequum between Latinus and Aeneas, the Romanae stirpis origo as Vergil253 calls it,254 describing the solemn promises of the Trojan leader to the Latins as follows:255 non ego nec Teucris Italos parere iubebo, nec mihi regna peto, paribus se legibus ambae invictae gentes aeterna in foedera mittant. sacra deosque dabo; socer arma Latinus habeto, imperium sollemne socer. The summa of this imperium sollemne, the spear, is in fact in the hands of Latinus. This definition of the old alliance could never be more actual for Rome than in 209 B.c. when the socii Latini wanted to abandon it, as Livy25" amply attests, especially since the same authority informs us that this coin- cided with a quite unusual drain on the gold re- serve of the aerarium sanctius.257 H. Willers,258 starting from entirely different premises, dated this gold issue exactly in this year.259 He made the fine observation that a descendant of the gens Veturia a hundred years later renewed this coin-type (pl. 6, 7-8), on the ground that in 209 B.c., when our foedus-scene reminded the Latins of their ancestral piety and duties, the praetor L. Veturius was one of the most important personalities. A coherent com- plement to the oath-scenes is given by the hitherto misunderstood obverse (pl. 6,1-4). The alliance with Latinus was imposed on Aeneas by the dii Pena- tes;260 similarly a later coin-type with the sow of Lavinium shows on the obverse the heads of these D(ii) P(enates) P(ublici) with their laurel-wreath (pl. 6,9-Io). In our case they are coupled as the two faces of a janiform head, a common practice of Greek iconography, combining two congenial per- sons or even an antithetic couple into a double unit.26 The prominent role of this youthful double head, which appears also on the silver quadrigati in the Hannibalic war, is now easy to understand; the Penates were the most venerable protectors not only of Rome, but also of the Latins. Vergil's picture of the foedus-ceremony has still another detail which must be discussed here. Latinus does not hold a spear but a scepter, like 243 Cf. Alf6ldi, Reiteradel (supra n. 16) 49 sqq. 244 Ad. Furtwdingler, Beschreibung der geschnittenen Steine im Antiquarium (Berlin 1896) 74 no. 1135-1136. H. Willers, op.cit.

But we know now that the legend of Trojan origin was not only very old in Latium, cf. my paper Die trojanischen Urahnen der Rdmer (Rektoratsprogramm der Universit~it Basel 1956 [1957]), but it was also used as a token of nobility by the Roman State at least since the attack of Pyrrhus; thus, the possi- bility of this allegory at the time of the issue of our coin-type is well established. 255 ibid. 12.189. 256 Liv. 29.9.1. 257 Liv. 27.10.11-13. 258 H.

Thomsen, Early Roman Coinage I (Copenhagen 1957) 91 sqq. But I am not convinced that the Mars-eagle series (Sydenham 25 no. 226 sqq.) is later than the oath-scene issue, and I wonder whether the first one could not be, as Willers and others supposed, the earliest Roman gold emission. 260 Dion.

The ancient commentators had already connected this passage with the staff preserved in the small temple of Jupiter Feretrius. Servius noted on this passage: ut autem sceptrum adhibeatur ad foedera, haec ratio est, quia maiores semper simula- crum lovis adhibebant: quod cum taediosum esset, praecipuo quando fiebant foedera cum longe positis gentibus, inventum est, ut sceptrum tenentes quasi imaginem simulacri redderent lovis: sceptrum enim ipsius est proprium. unde nunc tenet sceptrum La- tinus, non quasi rex, sed quasi pater patratus.262 Festus263 relies on the same source when he says: Feretrius luppiter ... ex cuius templo sumebant sceptrum, per quod iurarent, et lapidem silicem, quo foedus ferirent. But the oath-scene of the gold coins from 209 B.c. makes it certain that Latinus, in the older and better tradition, did not swear on a scepter, but on the spear. And it was not only Latinus who did so. When a staff was preserved for this purpose in the oldest sanctuary of Jupiter on the Capitol this was certainly not a pars pro toto of the attire of Jupiter, who had no image at all in this particular cult, but it was simply an archaic hasta praeusta,264 igne durata,265 consisting only of wood. We need not follow the cheap wisdom of the antiquarians who made a scepter of it. The venerable wooden spear belonged not to Feretrius, but to the war-gods; Polybios attests26' that the Romans swore a treaty with Carthage invoking Mars and Quirinus besides Jupiter Feretrius as divine witnesses of their oath.217 Also because the ritual of the spolia opima con- nected with the same shrine is offered to the triad Jupiter-Mars-Quirinus,268 there can be no doubt about the antiquity of the participation of the gods of the spear in the archaic ceremony of the foedus, nor that the presence of the spear was due to their role. The ritual object connected with Jupiter Feretrius was not the spear, but the lapis silex, with which the sow was killed. Servius (Aen. 8.641) explains this as follows: a fetialibus inventum (est) ut (por- ca) silice feriretur ea causa quod antiqui Jovis sig- num lapidem silicem putaverunt esse. This is only true in a special sense; they kindled the fire through sparks struck by this sort of stone26" and thus the silex was regarded as the source of lightning.270 The foedus, on the other hand, invoked exactly the thrower of the thunderbolt: audiat haec genitor, qui foedera fulmine sancit, King Latinus pronounces in Vergil,271 and we know the old formula of self- execration, connected with this invocation of Jupiter Feretrius:272 "Audi ... luppiter, si (populus Ro- manus) prior defexit publico consilio dolo malo, tum tu ille Diespiter populum Romanum sic ferito ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam" . . Id ubi dixit porcum saxo silice percussit.273 The spear watching over the oath is held by the king on the gold coins of 209 B.c.; but it could have this function also without such a human support, simply stuck in the earth. This must be the interpre- tation of the collective oath in front of a standard, the skeleton and essence of which was the hasta (pl. 6,5-6). Such is the ensign with flying ribbon, corresponding to the manipular signum of the Romans, under which the coniuratio of the peoples of Italy in the Social War is represented on their own coinage."' I think we must ascribe the same role to the vexillum used when an unforeseen men- ace of war occurred, though Servius does not ex- pressly mention it, when he elucidates the hoisting of the flag on the arx:275 aut certe si esset tumultus, id est bellum Italicum vel Gallicum, in quibus ex periculi vicinitate erat timor multus, quia singulos interrogare non vacabat, qui fuerat ducturus exerci- tum ibat ad Capitolium et exinde proferens duo vexilla, unum russeum, quod pedites evocabat, et unum caeruleum, quod erat equitum . .. dicebat "qui rem publicam salvam esse vult, me sequatur," et qui convenissent, simul iurabant: et dicebatur ista militia coniuratio.

We also know that the "mana" of the spear was linked with the war-gods in histori- cal times: pro Marte Romanos hastam coluisse.276 We possess, I think, a third variety of the divine spear, watching over the sanctity of the oath: this is the mosaic of the Villa Borghese, pl. 3,2, hitherto explained in another way.277 Three men278 stand around a boar, holding it with their left hands, and pointing to its body with an arrow in their right hands in the same way as do the patres patrati of the foedus with their swords on the oath-scenes we have discussed (pl. 6,i-io). The arrows are to be stuck into the animal. The men wear a pilleus and a tunica with a narrow clavus; the latter does not denote a low rank, but rather the prisca simplicitas of the nobles, whereas Mars, whose figure is very well characterized by R. Herbig, watches behind them with the spear. Here the predominance of the anthropomorphic divinity conceals the original role of the awful weapon, filled with power. DIVINE SPEARS IN EARLY GREECE Traces of the belief in the supernatural power of the spear in Greece have been assembled many times since the days of C. Boetticher. But our lead- ing authority in matters of Greek religion, Martin Nilsson, denies them any significance.279 He is of course right when he says that such a fetish had but very restricted importance in the classical epoch. But to contest the religious awe for a spear invoked by an oath, to suppose that an incidental cultual veneration of such a weapon in Hellenistic times is to be taken only as a late aberration without bearing on the whole problem, or to impute the cult of a spear in Chaironeia solely to the superstitious feel- ings raised by the incidental discovery of an old tomb--all these assumptions are not well enough established and above all they disregard the evi- dence for pre-classical times. This evidence alone concerns us here; it reveals common roots with those of Rome for the occult force of the spear. A testimony worthy of most serious consideration escaped the notice of Nilsson, whose brilliant achievements no one holds in higher esteem than the writer of this study.2s0 The story about the spear-cult of Kaineus, known hitherto only from troubled sources in the scholia of the Iliad28" and Apollonios Rhodios,282 is now attested by a papyrus- fragment of Akusilaos of Argos, an authority of the sixth century B.C.:283 A'yEL yap rEp't KaLvE'a ovrco: KawLV 7' 8 'EX70ov pLo-yerat IlooELt&amp;v.

This story is a moralizing tale condemning an archaic ritual and admonishing the people to restrict their veneration to the Olympian gods. This struggle of the classical Greek religion against ancient beliefs in fetishes, attested as early as the sixth century B.c. through Akusilaos, is a peremptory proof of the previous existence of the spear-cult; the struggle continues in later centuries. It must be stressed that not only the ritual veneration but also the oath by the spear was regarded in the classical epoch as &amp;fptq, con- tempt of the gods. Aischylos says of the Arcadian Parthenopaios:284 Ovvoo 8' C V EL, ' XXov 276 Varro by Arnob. 6.11; cf. Trogus by Justin. 43-3-3 and our remarks above; cf. Friedr. Schwenn, ArchRW 20 (1920/21) 299 sqq. 277 R. Herbig, RM 40 (1925) 289 sqq. (with the previous literature) following a suggestion of W. F. Otto, takes the scene as the ceremonial goat-skin-beating by the Salii. He writes on p. 300: "zwischen sich . . . halten sie . . . ein dunkelbraunes Fell mit schwarzen Zotteln. Die herabhlingenden Fiisse mit ge- spaltenen Hufen zeigen, dass es ein Ziegenfell sein muss, wenn sie auch etwas wildschweinartig kurz geraten sind." But the boar also has split hoofs and the skin is surely that of a boar. I think it is not a skin at all, but a boar, the sacrificial animal of the Latins (cf. the reverse of a denarius pl. 6, 9-1o), held by three men. The men, on the other hand, do not move their hands as if about to beat the animal, but they are preparing to pierce it with the arrows which they hold. As E. Q. Visconti stated (Sculture del palazzo della Villa Borghese 2 [Roma 1796] 74) they "stanno percotendo . . . una pelle di animale." 278 Only the head of that on the left is distorted through modern restoration, cf. Herbig, op.cit. (supra n. 277) 297 sqq. 279 M. P.

Many other such pious stories must have existed in Greek literature which were imitated by the Romans. Vergil depicts the contemptor divum,28 Mezzentius, the antagonist of his hero, as boasting: "dextra mihi deus et telum, quod missile libro, nunc adsint";290 no wonder that his opponent, the pius Aeneas, vanquishes him. The other enemy of Aeneas to be wiped out on similar grounds, Turnus, appeals to his spear in- stead of to the gods before the decisive struggle: 291 quassatque trementem (hastam) vociferans: "nunc o nusquam frustrata vocatus hasta meos, nunc tempus adest. . .." In spite of all this pious agitation, the belief in the supernatural force of the spear and even the ritual obeisance to some famous spears could not be sup- pressed completely. The principal object of cult veneration in the city of Chaironeia was the scepter of Agamemnon which was in fact a 8&amp;pv, as the inhabitants called it; if Pausanias'" calls it a OK7T'rrpov, the expression must have been coined under the influence of the epics. The daily cult and daily offerings of fresh food to this 86pv was ad- ministered by a specially appointed official in whose house the spear was sheltered. The oath by the spear must have been a common practice in early Greece. Apollo, whose attributes are the bow and lyre, but not the spear, and who has nothing to do with the spear, swears on the KpavLov aKdO7VLO in the Homeric hymn to Hermes;293 this can only be interpreted as a gen- erally accepted procedure. It is essential to realize that this oath was regarded as a strictly religious endeavor, and therefore a sacrilege from the stand- point of piety toward the gods. We have already seen how the outrage of Parthenopaios is com- mented upon by Aischylos; in another version of the story of Kaineus, not the worship, but the oath on the spear is the outrage which inflamed the wrath of Zeus.24 The wantonness of Idas by Apol- lonios Rhodios293 belongs to the same category: crro- vVV 8oPV ovpov, ory rrepPwo-rLO aXXw y xKV80i Et irrroXiqoeurtv aetpo/.Lat, OO 0fE AXXELt ZEvS oroov, ocwrtov r1TE p epovP opv, P7 v 7/ r. rt*7L Xolytov 0ETo-uOat, p'L ' a2Kpdavrov CE&amp;OXo "IS8eO eocrropEivoLo, Ka EL OO &amp;atLvr oqCro.

Vergil's paraphrase (Aen. 12.20o6) interprets this oath thus, the loss of life in his staff representing the fate which should strike him if he violates the oath.

No doubt, the oath would not be possible without this implement, as is also obvious in the case of Hector, who must raise his sacred scepter to Zeus as witness of his solemn obligation."' The contemptuous behavior of Achilles does not touch the fact that the oath's validity depended on the employment of the sacred staff, and its presence was necessary for all other solemn public governmental transactions. Even if the scepter became an imple- ment of ceremony in the Iliad, in which the emo- tional drunkenness of magical operations gave place to the beauty of poetic imagery, behind its concep- tion-even if far behind--it suggests the same clumsy atmosphere of "mana"-belief, as in the ceremony of the Roman federal oath. It would be very attractive to pursue the role of the hasta in Byzantium too; that this continuation really existed has been recently underlined by J. Deer.302 Such a new study could also decide the problem, whether the "Vortragslanze" of the medie- val German kings and emperors was an independ- ent phenomenon, as has been supposed, or was influenced-as I think it was--by the Roman hasta, the significance of which has not hitherto been realized. For such an analysis there is now an excellent new basis in the broadly conceived work of my dear friend Percy E. Schramm."3 A com- parison of our results with the staff as symbol of royalty in the Near East would also not be without interest. But this task must be an enterprise of others who are better equipped for it than the writer of this modest sketch. APPENDIX DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPES OF hasta AS EMBLEM OF POWER (pl. 10, figs. 1-48) Our pictorial survey of types needs only a few remarks with indication of provenience. Fig. I: The divine spear in the hand of king Latinus on the gold coins struck during the Second Punic War (pl. 6,1-4) and the spearhead on early denarii.304 Fig. 2: Spearhead as monetary mark on an early denarius (pl. 2,1-4). Fig. 3: The spear as summa imperili, a mark of control on the obverse, with the securis on the reverse of a denarius of L. Papius, dated by H. A. Grueber305 to the year 80 B.c., by Babelon306 to 79 B.C. and by E. A. Sydenham307 to 78-77 B.C. Fig. 4: The spear as badge of power with the rudder as symbol of felicitas on an engraved gem with the head of Asinius Pollio, ca. 42 B.C.308 Fig. 5: The same as control mark (pl. 5,2) on the obverse of a denarius of M. Volteius M. f. aedilis in 82 B.C.309 Another spear of the same shape is on the denarius of L. Papius (pl. 4,7), also as control mark, with a phalera on the reverse. Fig. 6: The spear as badge of imperium with the lituus on both sides of the head of DIVOS IVLIVS on the concave re- verse of a projected coin-issue in Bologna, with the head of the DIVI FILIVS on the concave obverse. This type certainly ex- isted, as the next drawing shows; however, the representation on a coin-die which we intended to reproduce proved to be not only different, but also fictitious. Cf. n. 46. Fig. 7: Iron spearhead found in W6ssingen (Baden, Ger- many), preserved in the Museum of Karlsruhe; more than 35 cm. long.310 Fig. 8: Similar spearhead on the top of a legionary standard on the column of Trajan in Rome.311 Fig. 9: Standard with spearhead on the same column.312 Fig. Io: Military standard applied as control mark on a denarius of C. Valerius Flaccus (pl. I,z) in Paris, in the form of a spear which has two lateral protuberances under the spear- head and perhaps a series of thin plastic rings below it; beneath them there is a tassel, as on many other sorts of signa. This coin has been dated in the latter half of the eighties of the first century B.c.313 Fig. Ii: Engraved spear on a so-called contorniate-medallion from the end of the fourth century A.D. Under the spearhead the same circular protuberances on both sides as the type just described.314 301 Hom. II. 10.319 sqq. 328 sqq. Arist.

Io-II reveal themselves as containing the two letters B(ene)f(iciarius) (consularis), or a similar abbreviated rendering of the rank of the official to whom it belonged. Fig. 13: Ovoid spearhead with an oblique incision on both sides, diagonally opposed to each other and with a little round hole on their inner ends. Original length ca. 60 cm. It was found in a sanctuary with two other still bigger spearheads and with a huge tuba in Kleinwinterheim with the inscription of A. Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento, consul the third time under Domitian.317 This colossal spear was not intended for practical purposes, but was a votive offering. Its type with the incisions is the same as that of the imperial spear-attribute of Domitian himself, fig. 18. Thus this votive spear imitates the praecipuum insigne of power, in this case that of the governor. Fig. 14: Bronze fibula with silver coat, found in Mainz,318 with the same lateral incisions on the spearhead. Fig. 15: Big iron spearhead with a prolongated rod-like point and the same incisions, from Noricum; found in St. Peter in Holz, preserved in the Museum of Klagenfurt.319 Fig. 16: Spearhead in miniature, in which two broader lateral incisions are cut, on leather. It was found in Vindonissa and is preserved in the Vindonissa-Museum at Brugg, Switzer- land.320 Fig. 17: Spearhead with oblique incisions on the top of the standard of an auxiliary troop represented on the tombstone of Pintaius in Bonn (pl. 9,1), first century A.D.321 Fig. I8: The spear-attribute of Domitian departing on a northern campaign, pl. 7,1. Relief found in the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome.322 Fig. 19: Silver fibula from Weisenau, Germany.323 Under an anchor-a nice allusion to advancement in the army-a spear is represented between two swords. The spear has a horizontal rod over the point, two round holes in the middle of the laurel- leaf-shaped spearhead and a small tabula ansata. The type of the swords indicates (in the sense of the argument of J. Hundt) a date around 200 A.D.,324 the more important because details of the type just described occur on a number of the varieties known (figs. 23-24, figs. 31-36, 45 show the horizontal strokes above the point. Fig. 24 and figs. 28-36 have the tabula ansata. Figs. 21-24 and figs. 24-45 have the two holes). The small tablet below the spearhead was regarded by Behrens as bearing the name or rank of the official to whom it belonged, an at- tractive hypothesis indeed. The two holes occur also on the spearheads of standards.325 This type generally belongs to the middle Empire. Fig. 20: Fragment of a decorative spearhead of iron, found in the Roman fortress of Niederbieber; the exact form is unknown.325a Fig. 21: Spear-ensign of a speculator pl. 9,2326 from Belgrade. The execution of the relief makes it unlikely that the spear would be an exact typological reproduction. Fig. 22: Big iron spearhead from the limes-fortress of Pfiinz in Germany.327 Fig. 23: Reproduction of the decorative spear-emblem of the speculator L. Valerius Augustalis on his tombstone, from Salona.328 We find here, instead of the horizontal stroke above the point, two short thorns directed obliquely upwards on both sides. Fig. 24: Decorative spear of a similar type, carved on one of the lateral slabs of the grave-aediculum of an unknown official (likely of the legio II adiutrix).329 Fig. 25: Spearhead, engraved on the left side of the altar of Clod(ius) Marianus, frumentarius of the legion VII Gemina, from Pons Aeni (Pfaffenhofen).330 Fig. 26: Official with spear-ensign from Perinthus,331 first half of the third century A.D. Fig. 27: Miniature spearhead, Museum in Olten, Switzer- land.332 It shows "wings" under the laurel-shaped point and besides the two round holes, triangular and round openwork- decoration (imitated). Fig. 28: Miniature spearhead from Cannstadt, likely to have been an ornament fixed on leather. I doubt that the two scrolls under the socket belonged to it; I suspect this is an irresponsible addition which has nothing to do with the spear-type.333 Fig. 29: Miniature bronze spear-emblem, with abnormally elongated point. The horizontal rod above the laurel-leaf-shaped blade has a lateral volute on both sides; below the blade is a tabula ansata.334 Fig. 30: Similar spearhead of the same provenience,335 with- out the tabula ansata, but with a crescent on the top.

We find a small lanceolate point above the blade; besides the horizontal rods above and below the blade, there is one more stroke under the latter. The two "eyes" are also to be mentioned. The same general type is represented also by our types nos. 32, 33 and 35. Fig. 32: Miniature spearhead, found in Wallstadt (Museum Mannheim), originally suspended on a ring as a hanging orna- ment.337 Similar pieces were noticed by G. Behrens from the fortress Zugmantel,338 from the Saalburg,339 from Stockstadt340 and from Osterburken.341 Fig. 33: Similar miniature hanging ornament from Heddern- heim.342 Fig. 34: Similar miniature spearhead, without the second blade on the top, from the fortress of K6sching.343 Fig. 35: Similar miniature spear-ornament from Oster- burken.344 Fig. 36: Similar piece ending in a pelta-shaped ornament on the top, known from the Wetterau-limes345 and Osterburken.346 The following types have a broader, circular contour instead of a laurel-leaf-shaped blade. They seem to represent a secondary development. Fig. 37: Open-work bronze ornament, once applied on leather, from Zugmantel.347 Fig. 38: Spear-ensign of a beneficiarius consularis from Vinxtbach.348 Fig. 39: Top of a vexillum of similar shape from Zugmantel, wrought of iron, with an iron cross-bar. Ritterling may be right that it did not belong to a military formation but to a collegium.349 Fig. 40: Standard of a collegium, based on the same round ornamental spear-type with two eyes as above, from the Mus~e Calvet, Avignon.350 Fig. 41: Similar standard from Alcudio, Mallorca.351 The following drawings exemplify another shape of these spear-ensigns with two superimposed blades. Fig. 42: Spear-emblem found in Ehl an der Ill and preserved in Wiesbaden. It is of iron and bronze,352 91 cm. high. Fig. 43: Spear-ensign of same type as fig. 42, on a relief illustrating Trajan's Dacian victories built into the triumphal arch of Constantine in Rome, pl. 7,2. The spear-ensign is en- graved in outline in the background of the battle scene, i.e. it is not employed in the actual fighting and it does not follow the Emperor himself, but is carried some distance from the battle. There is another corresponding spear engraved in outline on the other slab of the same battle relief, mentioned by Magi, but not visible in the photographs.353 Fig. 44: Original iron spear-ensign from the Roman fortress of Weissenburg a.S.; length 44 cm.354 Fig. 45: Similar spear with two superimposed heart-shaped blades, reproduced on the grave-altar of a beneficiarius consularis from Salona.355 The type with the horizontal rod on the top of the upper blades reminds us of the types nos. 31-35; it could mark the transition from these shapes to the rounder doubled ones in nos. 42-44.
