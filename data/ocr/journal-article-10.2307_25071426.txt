<plain_text><page sequence="1">Planning, Consciousness and Conscience Alan E. Singer ABSTRACT. Contemporary perspectives on concious ness provide us with a powerful metaphor for the cor porate planning process; although organisations ulti mately differ, in systems terms, from organisms. Like consciousness, planning has survival value and confers operational advantages. Whereas individuals' actions may be guided by conscience, in pursuit of ideals, corporate acts often lack these qualities. It may be that no diffuse planning process is capable of accomodating ideals and ethical standards, they are 'beyond' Corporate Consciousness. Therefore, the pursuit of corporate objectives will often conflict with individuals' ideals. The Oxford English Dictionary defines Anthro pomorphism as "the ascription of a human attribute to anything impersonal". Such ascrip tions are generally regarded as philosophically unsound, an error in reasoning: yet many writers on Corporate Strategy and Policy have found the temptation to 'anthropomorphise' to be almost irresistible. Moreover, most readers feel perfectly com fortable with such phrases as "The company expects, or wishes...', or acknowledge quite freely ideas like The Corporate Conscience'. Some theoreticians (e.g. Beer, 1981) have even claimed that organizations should be struc tured so as to employ the very principles embodied in the human nervous system, whilst others merely hint at such comparisons of Alan E. Singer is Lecturer at the Department of Business Administration, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand. He published various articles in the Magazine Accountancy, among others: 'Facing the Facts' (October 1983), 'Motivation &amp; Budgeting* (March 1982) and 'Taking "Right-Minded" Decisions' (October 1981). organization with organism: When Henry Mintz berg, for example, described how the human brain is divided into two hemispheres (the left is rational, analytic, sequential; whilst the right is intuitive, emotional, holistic) he casually observed that "...in a sense, the coupling of the holistic and sequential reflects how bureaucratic organizations themselves work..." (Mintzberg, 1976, author's italics). There does indeed seem to be a strong temp tation to award human-like properties, partic ularly some form of consciousness, to non human entities; but is this a temptation to sin? Many non-human animals possess what is generally regarded as consciousness; moreover corporations, by virtue of their planning processes, may be seen to possess a quality that is very close indeed to our modern concept of individual consciousness. However, it will be argued here that the subtle quality of human intuition and particularly the 'higher' ideals of conscience cannot be rooted in an organizational process no matter how complex; these remain the special preserve of the individual mind. In order to develop and support this argument it is first necessary to indulge in a popular intellectual pursuit: to clarify what is meant by 'Consciousness'. A study of the relevant literature reveals that thinking on the issue is strongly influenced by the Zeitgeist or intellectual fashion of the period. For example, as physics displaced chemistry at the spearhead of scientific advance so did conceptions of consiousness as an 'analysable compound' give way to ideas of 'particle interaction'. More recently, post-Darwinian thought has shifted from an 'anthropomorphic' position Journal of Business Ethics 3 (1984) 113-117. 0167-4544/84/0032-0113 $00.75. ? 1984 by D.

Singer which supposes that even micro-organisms enjoy 'psychic life' to the contemporary and popular doctrine of Emergent Evolution: Its main idea is a metaphor: just as the property of wetness cannot be derived from the properties of hydrogen and oxygen alone, so consciousness emerged at some point in evolution in a way underivable from its constituent parts.... (The) new relations emergent at each higher level guide and sustain the course of events distinctive of that level. Consciousness, then, emerges as something genuinely new at a critical stage of evolutionary advance. When it has emerged, it guides the course of events in the brain and has casual efficacy in bodily behaviour. (Jaynes) One influential supporter of this doctrine, it should be noted, is R. W. Sperry of the California Institute of Technology, the neuro scientist who has supplied us with much of the hard evidence for brain lat?ralisation of function. Sperry declares his support thus: I have already stated my belief that the organizational features of the brain which give rise to conscious processes are in large part genetically determined. If this is true then consciousness must be subject to the evolutionary processes. (1979) It may now be seen that this, contemporary, view of consciousness does indeed provide us with a very powerful metaphor for the process of corporate planning. A metaphor for corporate planning? Arguments that employ metaphor can be dan gerous but may also promote new insights. Some of the features of corporate planning, as a process, are strikingly similar to those of human consciousness conceived of as an emergent property. For example, corporate planning, as an activity 'emerged' during the 1960s in response to increasingly complex corporate function and structure. Sperry (1979) continues thus: From the standpoint of functional control, one may ask what benefits precisely are conferred by the in tro duction in evolution of subjective conscious effects? Thinking in regard to this question is still preliminary and speculative along lines like the following: consider the tactical difference between responding to the world directly and responding to inner conscious representations of the outside world.... The real world can hardly be manipulated as can inner images? Further, the employment of implicit trial-and-error responses to inner mental models and the avoidance thereby of overt response commit ments, with possible errors in the real world, is a central rationale in the evolution of thinking. One may equally well ask "What benefits, percisely, are conferred by the introduction of a corporate planning function in a complex organization?" The planning team do indeed employ some sort of model of the world, in order to evaluate various strategic options; by discarding strategic options which fail to deal with environmental threats and opportunities, the team intend to avoid those 'overt response commitments' which might prove damaging to the corporation. In other words, like consciousness, corporate planning has survival value. Like consciousness for the individual, planning confers operational advantages to the organization: Older... concepts of brain organization... may be replaced by a model in which the brain is seen to be organized as a decision-making control system monitored with value priorities and in which conscious phenomena confer certain operational advantages over and above those obtainable in systems that lack consciousness. Simply substitute 'corporate planning' for 'conscious phenomena' and 'corporation' for 'brain' to obtain a convincing sales pitch for your planning consultant. On the other hand, by adopting a rather dif ferent philosophical position regarding the nature of consciousness, this metaphor might equally well be embraced with enthusiasm by the 'anti-planners': the belief held by some that planning cannot significantly influence cor porate destiny would then correspond to the Epiphenomalist view of consciousness. Julian Jaynes describes this position thus:</page><page sequence="3">Planning, Consciousness and Conscience 115 Consciousness can no more modify the working mechanism of the body or its behaviour than can the whistle of a train modify its machinery or where it goes.... the shadow that loyally walks step for step beside the pedestrain, but is quite unable to influence his journey. This epiphenomenalist view, in turn, must contend with the fact that conscious awareness is seen to be heightened during moments when action is most hesitant (so, it is argued, con sciousness can scarcely be a by-product of action). Equally, by extending the metaphor, one may re-establish the primacy of planning by referring to cases where existing strategies are floundering and new ones have yet to emerge. All in all, the debate about the nature of individual consciousness nicely parallels that on the nature of corporate planning. Organizations and organisms Metaphors can be dangerous: In no sense are consciousness and planning the same process: By considering both as 'properties of complex systems', is it possible to say with any precision where the break down occurs? Ackoff and Emery provide us with an important clue. In their book 'On Purposeful Systems' they explain an important difference between organizations and organisms (including individuals) as decision making and control sys tems: Both organisms and organizations are purposeful systems, but organisms do not contain purposeful elements. The elements of an organism may be functional, goal-seeking or multi-goal seeking but not purposeful. (1972) Most physiologists would agree. The elements or subsystems of an organism are indeed goal seeking as J. Z. Young explains: But we now find that every organism contains systems that literally embody set points or reference stan dards. The control mechanisms operate to ensure that action is directed to maintaining these standards; but these subsystems are not purposeful. Note that a purposeful (sub) system is one that "selects its goals as well as the means to pursue them", a purposeful system is capable of changing its own goals in constant environ mental conditions, thereby displaying what we might call 'will'. Acceptance of their thesis leads us to con clude that it is the existence of purposeful sub systems (Divisions, Departments or individual employees) in the corporations that precludes us from asserting that properties of the brain neces sarily have counterparts in organizations. Indeed, Ackoff and Emery claim that: This difference alone (i.e. the existence of purposeful subsystems) will be sufficient to justify the differen ces between biology and sociology. It is interesting to pursue this point. If the existence of purposeful subsystems is the essen tial distinction between organizations and organisms, as systems, then an organization which is so structured as to deny the freedom of 'selecting goals' to all its subsystems, is closer, in systems terms, to a complex organism. In such an organization, the 'consciousness' becomes identified with that of the CEO who 'uses' fhe organization as a tool in pursuit of his objectives. Conversely, the greater the degree of autonomy delegated to subsystems of the firm the less can one speak, even metaphorically of 6a (unified) corporate consciousness'. In other words, where strategy formulation is shifted downwards it becomes, as Andrews (1980) puts it "a process of organization rather than the masterly conception of a single mind". This may appear self-evident, but are there implications for the quality of the strategy which emerges? The individual strategist Mintzberg (1976) tentatively suggested that where a strategy is indeed the result of one individual's efforts it is often creative, integrated and 'interesting': "Scratch an interesting strategy" he claims, "and you will probably</page><page sequence="4">116 Alan E. Singer find a single strategy formulator beneath it". If, however, "The organization goes the route of systematic planning... it will probably come up with what can be called a 'main line' strategy". Implicit here is a suggestion that the individual is capable of excelling in the quality of his or her 'strategic thinking' beyond that which can be achieved by organizational processes (by the Corporate Consciousness, that is). Moreover, this excellence may only be achieved through articulation of left and right hemispheres which enables a synthesis of intuition and rationality 'in the same skull'. The 'Corporate brain', it seems, either lacks a right hemisphere altogether or else cannot achieve the integration of right with left that would harness creative forces within the system to rational planning proce dures. Moreover, it would seem plausible that a 'Cor porate brain', deficient in balancing intuition with rationality, might also lack the higher form of consciousness that we think of as conscience. How reasonable is it to expect that ethical behaviour would emerge from an organizational process of strategic planning? Corporate ideals Ethical behaviour entails the existence of ideals. Ackoff and Emery have offered a definition of an ideal using the general language of systems theory: It is "an objective that cannot be obtained in any time period but can be approached without limit9'. This 'approach' being achieved through regular re-formulation of lower level objectives. Corporate objectives undoubtedly exist, but does the concept of a 'corporate ideal' have any substance? The corporation may be purposive, in that short term goals are amended in pursuit of longer term objectives; (for example: sacrifice short term profitability to promote growth in market share) but is it an 'ideal seeking system'? Not if we accept Mintzberg's idea that "strategy is the organizations 'conception' of how to deal with its environment for a while" (1976, author's italics). There is nothing here to support the thesis of an idealistic input to strategy. Indeed, the 'systems' concept of ideal, as a super-long range, possibly unattainable goal seems to be rather close in spirit to Heibroner's 'Grandiose image of society' which, the philosopher claims, is conspicuously lacking in business ideology. Short on ideals, corporate actions all too often seem to lack 'higher consciousness', or conscience. The unknown distance In his book of this title, Engleberg traces the literary usage of the words 'Consciousness' and 'Conscience' in the writings of several great thinkers. Once similar, the meanings drifted apart, reaching a critical stage of separation in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when conscience was largely associated with guilt. Yet this is the same period when 'corporate policy' often advocated pursuit of profit with matters of conscience conveniently delegated to another institution altogether. Engleberg has concluded that such a separa tion of meaning is untenable: the development of consciousness leads, via an 'unknown distance' to individual conscience. Sure enough, corporations now find that a planning procedure, devoid of ethical considera tions, is likewise 'untenable': As external pres sure groups blossom and place increasing con straints on acceptable strategy, so planning becomes more demanding; the corporation needs a 'higher consciousness' or conscience, if it is to survive. It may be that no diffuse planning process is capable of fully assimilating consideration of ideals and ethical standards; the process becomes too complex; in other words, it is beyond Cor porate consciousness. Instead, ethical conduct may be brought about either through 'public law', from outside the corporation, or else from the 'private consciences' of individual policy makers. (In a free society the preferred alter native is obvious.)</page><page sequence="5">Planning, Consciousness and Conscience nj The price of conscience Conscience, as Engleberg reminds us, has its price and its risks. Heightened awareness of the effects of corporate actions on employees and society is a big problem for strategy formula tion. (Ackoff (1974) for example, refers to the ' 'Humanisation and Environmentalisation problems99.) As H. A. Simon might argue, having more goals is equivalent to having more con straints; for those who prefer a less technical statement of this theme, ponder the "most famous soliloquy in English": Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. (Hamlet) In other words, conscience and dynamism do not mix well, at least in most corporate cultures. A control system that rewards effective action in pursuit of corporate objectives allstoo often con flicts with individuals' ideals. Andrews (1980) makes the same point thus: "No system of control... can take the place of the individual who has a clear idea of right and wrong...'. Whilst L.A. Appley asserts, in his book 'The Management Evolution': The highest standard for each individual is that which his conscience tells him is best. Perhaps, then, those senior managers who are really serious about 'Good Corporate Citizen ship' might begin by staffing their organizations, right to the top, with 'good citizens'. As a result, emergent strategies are then more likely to be morally defensible and implementa tion relatively free from conflict. Perhaps the 'unknown distance' can, at least, be diminshed.
