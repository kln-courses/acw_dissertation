BERNSTEIN, Yeshiva University THE FIRST PASSAGE from the Temple Scroll published and dis- cussed at length by Yadin, column 64, lines 6-13, maintains a prominent place in the scholarly arena, even after the remainder of the document has been made available.' Attention has been focused on the relationship between the exegesis in the Scroll and that in 4QpNahum, and concomitant conclusions have been drawn on the use of hanging/crucifixion as a Jewish death penalty in the late Second Commonwealth, conclusions which, in turn, may shed light on a variety of NT passages dealing with crucifixion.2 Since the documentation of this mode of execution, * I should like to express my appreciation to teachers and colleagues at Yeshiva University who commented upon and criticized earlier versions of this paper: particularly Dr. Yeshayahu Maori, in whose seminar preliminary research on the subject was begun, Dr. Sid Z. Leiman, and Dr. Richard Steiner, in whose course on syntactic ambiguity a portion of an earlier draft was read. Dropsie University (and its current President, Dr. David Goldenberg) was kind enough to invite me to participate in its Guest Lecture Series in 1980-81, and this paper was presented there in November, 1980. At that time, Dr. Barry Eichler and Dr. Emanuel Tov of the University of Pennsylvania contributed constructive criticism. The Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture supported my research with a Doctoral Scholarship during the period in which this paper was rewritten. Y.

Al- though the phrase has drawn attention, the fact that we have here a needed witness to ancient exegesis of this Biblical text has not been sufficiently stressed. Most discussions of the passage have been concerned with "hanging" rather than "cursing," and as a result the significance of the Temple Scroll exegesis in the context of other Jewish interpretations has not been realized. In particu- lar, there has been a failure on the part of scholars to analyze carefully the full range of Tannaitic and Targumic material pertinent to this verse before viewing the Qumran passage in its ancient perspective.4 In the present paper, I shall set the newly found exegesis of this text against its other ancient interpretations shall not be concerned in this paper with the meaning of 'tn, i.e., whether it means "hanged," "crucified," or even "strangled." The mode of execution pre- supposed in this passage (and for that matter, in 4QpNahum) seems to bear little on the exegesis of the clause '*n D';Ir K n5p7 'D as a whole. I hope to deal elsewhere with the problem of T;Tn and "related" terms in ancient exegesis. 3 I have discussed in detail the exegetical and stylistic relationship of the passage in the Temple Scroll to the verses in Deuteronomy in "Midrash Halakhah at Qumran? 1 lQTemple 64.6-13 and Deuteronomy 21:22-23," in Gesher, 7 (1979), 145-66. 4 Although 4QpNahum is often discussed in conjunction with our passage in the Temple Scroll, no clear exegesis of Deut. 21:23 can be extrapolated from the clause yK[P'] yPr 'y 'n *'nr '= (4QpNahum 3-4 i 8). The phrase ;, K n5p has simply left no overt mark there. Allegro, in his initial publication of the text, "Further Light on the History of the Qumran Sect," JBL 75 (1956), 91, n. o-o, had cited with approval Cross and Freedman's suggestion that the words DnfK n55p "have been avoided for pietistic reasons, the writer and readers knowing full well what was intended." The intent of the author was "Scripture calls the one hanged alive on the tree [cursed by God]." However, in the "official" publication of the text, DJD, V, 38-41, Allegro translates otherwise, and does not even mention his earlier version as an alternative. For a variety of approaches to the enigmatic pesher-Nahum passage, see M. P. Horgan, Pesharim: Qumran Interpretations of Biblical Books (CBQMS 8) (Washington D.C., 1979), 178-79; for a recent attempt to see exegesis of Deut. 21:23 in 4QpNahum see below, n. 25. 22</page><page sequence="3">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN in an attempt to determine precisely where in the broad exegetical pattern it belongs. 71n Xb .ry Y nlK n,nl nnlwl nin vDsin Kun Ktn 7rn;rT "Di xKi n»n ontr K ncrip )» xminn orn Wn3ipn l3p z yyi r yc ln^= ."5n^m: j1 r -n ^ vrr x InnInx nm xnun (Deut. 21:22-23).

The reason for the prohibition against overnight exposure of the executed individual may be found in any of the succeeding phrases, and this ambiguity in logic contributes to the syntactic ambiguity present in the phrase "a curse of God is a hanged one." The ambiguous phrase D1H3R n5rp, "a curse of God," can be understood as either an objective genitive, "a curse towards God" (cf. perhaps, In~p P "the curse on you," Gen. 27:13), or a subjec- tive genitive, "a curse from God" (cf. rDnl nr5p: "the curse of [i.e., pronounced by] Yotham," Judg. 9:57).5 Once the syntactic analysis of the phrase vDrR nr p17 has been determined, its logical relationship with the remainder of the clause and sentence must be understood.

The Septuagint is the oldest source which manifests the subjective genitive, translating KcKaTr1pdPevoS 6nto 0Eco irnq 6 KpeIdgpevoS enii 6iXou ("Cursed by God is everyone hanged on a tree."). The Vorlage of LXX may indeed have differed from MT, as witness the "every" before "hanged" and the addition of "on the tree."7 But most striking is the shift from MT noun n5p1 to LXX passive participle KcKaTzrpdaevoq.8 In order to guarantee the meaning of the text as a subjective genitive, the ambiguous "curse of God" is transformed into "cursed by God." This exege- sis of the text implies that since the hanged body is cursed, it should be taken down quickly to prevent the surrounding land from becoming tainted. The Biblical syntax accepts such a read- ing smoothly, and if we accept the fact that the Greek is but a disambiguating transformation of MT, the exegesis of the clause is clear. The author of the Epistle to the Galatians, 3:13, derives from the verse Deut. 21:23 that the curse of the Law (based on Deut. 27:26, nxrK ir nn 1'iin nx D'p' '5 ' 1'1KX) has been removed by Jesus: iHCtq tk7riy6paosv EK Tfq KaTdpaq To v6opou yEV6OPvog t6nIp lPiv KaTdpa OTt y7ypairat EnucKaTapaToS ir 6 Kppegd- pevoq tn'i iuk0ou ("He has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse on our behalf; for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone hanged on a tree.'"). That Paul interprets D;',x n5p1 as a subjective genitive seems clear, although he does not cite our verse literally.9 Assuming that the passive participle is an exegeti- cal phenomenon in Galatians as in LXX to Deut., the author is 6 Jerome, in his commentary to Gal. 3:13 (PL, XXVI, 386-87), discusses various interpretations of 'ln D;t''5K n'557 'D which were known to him, both subjective and objective genitives, but does not distinguish among them syste- matically. 7 Cf.

Because he is concerned with '11'1 = "cursed" as found in Deut. 27, he employs 7t1tKaTdpatoS, which LXX uses for '111 there, rather than KeKaTpdPtcevoS, which LXX employs in 21:23.10 The He- brew of his words (if we may retranslate) would be (1Ut) ': 1'K ry ' y Y' n. The words I6nt 0coi are also not cited in his text, as it would be somewhat embarrassing theologically to refer to Jesus as "cursed by God." We can only assume that in a nonhomiletical context Paul would have translated D'n5K r5P as LXX (and the Vulgate later on, "maledictus a Deo") do." The one "normative" Jewish source which maintains the sub- jective gentive rendering of 'SLn D'5IK n5½p 'I is the Targum Neofiti. Translating 35t' : I ' Dip 'o5 ("Cursed before God is everyone who is hanged/crucified"), Neofiti shares with LXX and Galatians the transformation of n5rp into a passive participle, and the presence of "all" (5:, nat) before the word for "hanged." Although 'nt Dip is not literally equivalent to 6no6 0co, it is almost certain that the same concept is implied in each case. All three sources manifest an exegesis which considers the cursing as the result of being hanged.'2 When we turn from this simple catena of sources which maintains the subjective genitive reading of '9rn Dr5x n '5p ': to the group which prefers the objective genitive, a far more com- plex picture emerges. There are at least two distinct interpreta- tions of DnrK nS5p as an objective genitive in Tannaitic sources, and they are joined by Josephus, the Peshitta, Symmachus, and TJ1 (Pseudo-Jonathan). Although they all agree on the syntactic analysis of the objective genitive, they differ in the meaning they '0 Cf. Wilcox, p. 87. Since the context of Paul's exegesis is Jesus' becoming Katidpa, a curse, we see even more clearly how he understands the word. See B. Byrne, Sons of God-Seed of Abraham (Rome, 1979), p. 154, n. 70. The presence of Katdpa in Galatians might militate against seeing in LXX the manifestation of a Vorlage differing from MT, although it is possible that Paul's use of KaTdpa ... 7ntKaTadpaTOS is intended to preserve two different readings in the Deuteronomic text. " Wilcox, p. 87, seems to believe that the omission of lrn6 0EoO from Paul's quotation is serious. Regardless, it is not likely that Paul's subjective genitive interpretation is predicated on the omission of 7nT6 0eoO, or that he would have read the verse differently if translating from Deut. 21. 12 For the marginal Targum in Neofiti, see below, pp. 34-35. 25</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW give to it, as well as in the way they perceive the relationship of the clause to the rest of the sentence.'3 The baraita B.Sanh. 45b in discussing which criminals are to be hanged after their execution, understands the expression nr1p D';NX, according to both R. Eliezer and the Sages, as referring to the crime of blasphemy.'4 UT prn rn ,rn D,TRK n5,p : -:= ny IT pn in -Dr inl nYrlx -1 vin- ;rnT1D7Uo nD x? ;r5nnpODUt p115':: zI N : R 1p'1i9: ("'For a curse of God is hanged': 'Just as this curser who is stoned, so, too, all who are stoned,' so said R. Eliezer; but the Sages say, 'Just as this curser who denied a fundamental tenet, so, too, all who deny fundamental tenets.'") According to both R. Eliezer and the Sages, then, the phrase "a curse of God" is equated with "a curser of God." These Tannaim disagree only about the degree to which we extend the analogy of the blasphemer as regards the penalty of postmortem exposure. There are two difficulties with this interpretation: first, how does "a curse of God" come to mean "a curser of God," i.e., a blasphemer? Second, and more critical, this clause in the Biblical sentence furnishes a reason, prima facie, for lowering the corpse, while the translation implicit in the baraita describes the reason for its suspension and exposure. Can this Rabbinic exegesis be understood as deriving from a straightforward reading of the Biblical text? As regards the first difficulty, the Rabbis do not describe explicitly how D';x n 'p' comes to mean a blasphemer, and it is probable that this reading of the text is to be understood as Midrashic, and not at all as the literal meaning of the text, but there may be a way to reconcile the interpretation of the baraita with the plain sense of the text, at least in part. The Rabbis of the baraita may have understood the clause '1*n D';rx n51p ': as "for on account of blasphemy of God he was hanged" (with the assumed deletion of the preposition 5y). 5 A similar syntactic analy- sis seems to be operative in Symmachus' 6ot 6t&amp;5a p3aoqprpiav and perhaps in Onqelos' :nnm y 8'1 as well, as we shall see below. 13 We shall begin with the Tannaitic sources, even though, strictly speaking, the form in which they are now found postdates Josephus for certain, and perhaps some of our other material as well. 14 Cf. Sifre Deut. 221 (ed. Finkelstein, p. 253). 15 My colleague, Dr. Richard Steiner, suggested this approach. Z. Karl, Mehkarim ba-Sifre (Tel-Aviv, 1954), p. 212, writes, "They [the Rabbis] explained l1n D3n7Kx n11p, 'because of the curse of God he was hanged."' 26</page><page sequence="7">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN The contextual difficulty, however, is perhaps more awkward to solve. If 'r n Dt;R*K nyp ': teaches that the blasphemer is to be hanged, it can have no bearing on the body's being lowered after exposure. At best, we may translate, "You must bury him since he was hanged for blasphemy (which, by implication, is a heinous crime)," and he should not therefore remain exposed. This reading, however, is far from explicit in the text. It is more likely that we are to construe the phrase, according to R. Eliezer and the Sages, as parenthetical to the logic of the verse, which would then proceed, "You shall not allow to remain overnight ... but you must bury ... so that you do not render unclean. ...." On the literal level of interpretation, this would be a very infelicitous solution, but it is not surprising in the context of Rabbinic hermeneutic.16 Josephus, too, is a member of this branch of the objective genitive tradition, writing, 6 pkao(cprljtoa Oc6v KaTaXcua0oci Kpepado)O 6t' fippaq Kai dTi'po) Kai d(pav)gS OaaTzireo ("Let him that blasphemes God, after being stoned, be hanged all day long, and let him be buried dishonorably and ignominiously"). Citing the penalty of stoning for the blasphemer (presumably from Lev. 24:16), he adds the shame of hanging to the death penalty. "It is unlikely that Josephus on his own produced the same exegesis as the Tannaim Da;X n~p = '1 n = p," since he would have no reason to relate these words in Deuteronomy to the specific crime of blasphemy without the Midrashic reading.17 Since Josephus is not writing even a close paraphrase of the Deuteronomic text (much the less a translation), as witness his conflation with the law from Leviticus, we cannot discern whether he took this interpretation to be the meaning of the text on a 16 Y.

Given the opportunity, he might have preferred a reading which integrates more smoothly into the syntax of the Biblical sentence. One cannot tell whether he was aware that Di;xt nLp, might be equivalent to Do;x nr~Lp y, but it is quite clear that his 6 pokac(prlpyaq cannot be based on the exegesis of D;,5x nr5p as a subjective genitive which is manifest in the Greek Bible. Symmachus' translation of this clause 6zt 6ta p3kaocprpiiav 0eoo tKcpepado0r ("For on account of blasphemy of God he was hanged") is quite strikingly parallel to the Rabbinic exegesis; note his use of 6ta which is the analogue of the hypothetically deleted preposition "as a result of" suggested earlier. The remainder of Symmachus' translation maintains a word-for-word correspon- dence with MT. The Peshitta, on the other hand, although it represents the same exegetical tradition with its r1p-'I xnI5t xn:n 1Tgn 5Ur ("Because he who blasphemes God should be hanged"), deviates from a literal translation of the phrase D;rx nr5p and relates it to the blasphemer (X;55K KnXnT 1Tn), following the Rabbis as Josephus seems to do, rather than relating it to his crime like Symmachus. The Peshitta, representing MT's Do;x nr5p by a clause not unlike the Rabbis' DUtn nm 'pIUv 'z (Sanh. 6:4; B.Sanh. 46a; cf. below, p. 30), is a very loose translation of the text. It is not clear what accommodation either Symmachus or the Peshitta would make to relate '9ln D;'5xr n5p ': to the rest of the verse, and we should perhaps take the clause as parenthetical, and not as furnishing a reason for the lowering of the corpse. This approach, while perhaps acceptable for the baraita on 45b, is somewhat harder to acknowledge in the case of translators who are attempting to convey the meaning of a text and not extrapo- lating a law from it exegetically. It is possible that the reading of Symmacnus-Peshitta agrees with Rashi's interpretation of Sanh. 6:4 (cf. below, p. 31).18 18 It is hard to imagine either the Peshitta or Symmachus arriving at this interpretation, with its violation of simple syntax, without the Rabbinic tradition. It is perhaps noteworthy that the Peshitta, within two verses, rejects normative Rabbinic tradition which is also the simple sense of MT (by describing hanging as the death penalty in 21:22), and goes out of its way to follow a Rabbinic derivation which does not harmonize smoothly with the Hebrew in 21:23.

Meir (Tos. Sanh. 9:7, ed.

Meir used to say, 'What is the meaning of the verse "For a curse of God is a hanged one"? It is analogous to two twin brothers who looked very much alike; one ruled over the world, and the other went out to a life of crime. When the criminal was apprehended and hanged/crucified, all the passersby kept saying that it appeared as if the king was being hanged. Therefore Scripture states, 'For a curse of God is a hanged one""'). This analysis seems to take D'r5K nr5p quite literally. The "curse toward God" is brought about by the fact that since hanging a man, even post mortem, is a degradation, and since man is made in God's image, an insult to man becomes ipso facto an insult to God. The latter notion that God and man share a common image, although implicit, is clearly the support of R. Meir's statement. We may ask whether, according to R. Meir, it is the hanging of a human being (made in God's image) which eo ipso engenders the curse toward God, or whether it is the remarks of passersby (about man being made in God's image) which make it operative. Regardless, there seems to be no reference in this exegesis to any crime of blasphemy for which the corpse was exposed.19 R. Meir's interpretation of the clause 'rln D'rXK n517p ' fits quite well into the remainder of the verse, "You shall not leave his corpse exposed. . . but you shall bury him .. .for a hanged man is an offense to God."

The interpretation we have suggested seems quite clear. The Talmud (46b), commenting on R. Meir's view in the Mishnah that the Shekhinah is affected, as it were, by human suffering, seems to link that with blasphemy, but the connection is strictly homiletical, and does not represent a viable reading of the Biblical verse. 29</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW carries with it a shameful attitude toward God, and the corpse should be removed by nightfall. The exegesis of R. Meir, although it appears on the surface homiletical or philosophical, is never- theless closer to a literal reading of the Biblical text than that of R. Eliezer and the Sages, which does not seem intended to explain the text, but to derive a law from it.

The second of these, which we shall call TJlb, is obviously related to the exegesis of R. Meir: "And since he was made in the image of the Lord, you shall bury him at sunset, so that people do not abuse him." Since the disrespect to God clearly is said to derive from the fact that the hanged man is made in God's image, we can infer from TJlb with greater assurance than from R. Meir's parable that the concept that man is made in God's image is the basis of this interpretation. This is so whether we take 7'2 as referring to the hanged man, as is likely, or to God, which is a bit more difficult, since the closest referent, the suffix of ,;TI1np7n, is the human being. The xrnr'i of TJlb are the vtt1 'nly 7 of R. Meir's parable.20 This Targumic version is a full restatement of R. Meir's reasoning as it applies in a close reading of the Biblical verse. There remain two sources which, although clearly belonging to the objective genitive traditions, demand independent analysis. The first is the Mishnah (Sanh. 6:4; B.Sanh. 46a): '1l1 I: OK1 n557p o D 3pn l-p o rpnI uy ln^= 7T-n X? .IKmv Ivyn x5&gt; otVn n : n 1T .'[l' ']~r .fn -. ,r- , ]Dn 'iln* '111 *''n on,KR bUnnrn cpty rv tv xYnl ("If he remains overnight, one transgresses a negative injunction, since Scripture states, 'You shall not allow his cadaver to remain overnight, but you must certainly bury him, since a curse of God 20 In the light of our interpretation, there seems to be no justification for E.

Like R. Eliezer and the Sages, the Mishnah associates 'lrn D rf n 17jp ,' with blasphemy (note particularly the use of l'Piv ,'r3 which represents the Biblical n51p *, ); the reason for the exposure is blasphemy. But the context of the Mishnah, unlike that of R. Eliezer and the Sages, is the prohibi- tion of overnight exposure, like the simple sense of the Biblical verse, and hence demands a reason for lowering the corpse, not for its suspension; therefore the clause 5nnn ... . . m 1, which is a reason for lowering the corpse, without defining what consti- tutes otVn 5r*n. The classical Rabbinic interpretation of the Mishnah, as found, for example, in Rashi (to B.Sanh. 46a, s.v. rnnrn rt?V DtV) is that "they [passersby] mention that this one [the corpse] blas- phemed Him." There is nothing intrinsically offensive to God about the hanged man, and it is only the comments of passersby pertaining to his blasphemy which bring about wrin ~l'rn. This approach derives from an attempt to integrate the two clauses of the Mishnaic sentence (KXY l . .. . ':: V T ,r)- the profanation of God's name will result indirectly from the original blasphemy by the hanged criminal. According to Rashi, we may perceive two analyses of 'fn Dr Kr n 17p :--"blasphemy" and "an affront toward God," although Rashi resorts to the crime of blasphemy in order to explain the affront to God.21 An alternative suggestion, ventured not without knowledge of possible difficulties, can be proposed for the Mishnah. The Mishnah may reflect, in addition to the exegesis of rnRK n p517 understood as blasphemy, the exegesis of the verse demonstrated 21 Maori, p. 175, n. 2, seems to accept Rashi's interpretation of DW ttXl31 5rnnn D,'wt, although he does distinguish between two interpretations of D f';5K n1'51 in the Mishnah: blasphemy and an affront to God. In a conversation Professor Maori suggested that r1i5' in the Mishnah indicates a quotation of the question and answer of passersby. In fact, H. Albeck, Commentary to the Mishnah: Nezikin (Tel-Aviv, 1959), p. 188, writes, s.v. l1n5D, "The expression 'l,n D':r'K ni,1 ' is as if to say that people will say 'Why was he hanged?'..." But in such a reading '1?I5 must do double duty. Rashi's explanation would also limit those exposed after stoning to the blasphemer, since only in that case does this reasoning occur. This point has been noted already by MaHaRSHA in his gloss ad loc. 31</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW by R. Meir, that the hanged man, who is made in the image of God, brings about profanation of God's name merely by remain- ing exposed. The Mishnaic KXYr1 is not the direct result of the blasphemy (olyn nK l,p'rv r), but of the hanging itself ('l1n M). The hanged man is ipso facto, as suggested earlier, an affront to the Deity, and therefore must be removed from exposure. The Mishnah, according to this interpretation, juxtaposes both objec- tive genitive readings of ,l1n DnrfR nFp ' in order to explain why the body, although deserving of hanging, must be lowered. Both the classical interpretation and our suggestion present problems when analyzed carefully. Rashi's view reads into the Mishnah passersby and their comments, who do not seem to be intrinsic to the text. Our suggestion requires KXY:1 to be the outcome not of the immediately preceding clause, but of the earlier portion of the sentence. The fact that the Talmud cites the baraita of R. Meir on 46b, using this phrase in the Mishnah as its lemma, might support our interpretation of the Mishnah which connects them. Rashi's interpetation of the Mishnah seems to lean heavily on the passersby of R. Meir, but whereas for R. Meir the passersby may only be present in the parable, and the lowering of the corpse is to take place because it is intrinsically offensive to God even without the passersby's comments, for Rashi the passersby furnish the only reason for the lowering of the corpse. Regardless of the acceptance of our view of the passage or of the classical one, there may be room to see two exegeses of ,Ln onrKr n55p 4' side by side in the Mishnah.22 TJ1, as we noted earlier, presents a conflation of exegeses of 'l*n 'rnIK n517 ':.

Geiger, "Symmachus the Greek Translator," Collected Essays [Hebrew] (Warsaw, 1910), p. 57, suggests that the Tosefta and baraita are an expansion of R. Meir's Mishnaic exegesis, but although they represent the same syntactic construction (a point which Geiger fails to stress), R. Meir's words in the Tosefta and baraita are clearly an attempt to understand '1~n D'rtSK n½5p 'D as a reason for lowering the corpse, while his Mishnaic exegesis does not seem to have the same intent. 32</page><page sequence="13">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN xKn1K rlp7 and the other by nr' 1r3l ':nin TSK(?)

The former clearly asserts the reason for lowering the corpse, while the latter, if obscure, may denote the cause for its initial suspension.23 This exegesis might be compared to that in the Mishnah: n' Iilq '3lnn prf would indicate the crime (like otnV nx l n'tW 3v 5), although the Targum leaves the specific violation unexpressed for euphemistic or other reasons, and Kn 'K 0rp Kmnl5' would be the equivalent of 5nnz trV mry m Kn3, understood not according to Rashi, since blasphemy is not mentioned, but according to our suggestion that the Mishnah is working with the reasoning of R. Meir, though unexpressed. This reading of TJla avoids the awkwardness of our reading of the Mishnah. The exegesis of ,9n r,nrK n5p, '9 as the reason for the lowering of the corpse, which is the simple sense of the Biblical text, precedes the Midrashic interpretation of the phrase as the reason for exposure. But this suggestion is far from certain; the major stumbling block is the obscure nr' 1r1 'gin i 5rK.24 This paraphrase turns 'l9n into an active infinitive mSyt5, and describes the act of hanging as the xnK51p; the Dltn 59,n in our interpretation of the Mishnah also results from the hanging itself, and not from anything else.25 23 ., 10nl '13in trK may not correspond to anything in the Biblical text, and may be a pietistic comment. If it reflects anything in the verse, 'ln UD'nS n'55l ': is as good a possibility as anything, if we consider that "1' 11l1 '131n might be euphemistic for blasphemy. 24 This phrase is very likely related to TO StYK t 'r D'17 rnT 5mY, but since no satisfactory explanation has been offered for that expression, this suggestion is made for TJla independently of TO. 25 J. Baumgarten has recently proposed ("Hanging," pp. 14 and 16, nn. 42-49) an interpretation of the words 'n Tl n in 4QpNahum which, in his opinion, shares a common feature with TJI (our TJla). He takes 'n 'l*n in 4QpNahum to mean "one who hangs a living man," asserting that the passive participle has an active meaning, as in such Mishnaic idioms as T1 ''lin, ,lt31 '1D, 31Y1, etc., and the Biblical 3in 'TnK. TJ1, according to Baumgarten, by rendering ,*n with 3*ytaS, seems also to have taken 'l*n in an active sense. From a linguistic point of view, however, this ingenious suggestion does not seem tenable. Not all verbs lend themselves to this "active" usage of the passive participle. In the Mishnaic examples the passive participle indicates the new state in which the subject of the verb is found after completing the action implied in the verb. Cf. E. Y. Kutscher, The Language and Linguistic Background of the Isaiah Scroll (Leiden, 1974), p. 350, cited by Baumgarten (p. 16 n. 47), and the classic article by J. Blau, "Passive Participle with Active Meaning," Lesonenu, 18 (1952-53), 67-81. Al- though not all "active" passive participles developed in the same way, Blau points 33</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW There is one more version which clearly belongs to the objec- tive genitive tradition, but which is hard to clarify because its key word is difficult both to read and to construe. The marginal note in Targum Neofiti reads (following Diez Macho's suggestion in the printed critical apparatus, Neofiti, V, p. 183) [leg? pt,] 1T, [leg vY:a ] nY? 'lr nr'n':v l,'1.26 McNamara and Maher render it (ibid., p. 520) "For contempt (?) of the glory of the Shekhinah of the Lord is one crucified." Although none of the other Targumim render or paraphrase nr5p by a form of 'T: here, TJ2 (Vat 440) translates 1,:K pir1 (Exod. 21:17) with ,nn ii1.27 But Diez Macho's reading of the text here is open to question on a number of grounds. He apparently vocalizes T1,p as bizydn, and emends ?tYX to :Ytr, a Pacel passive participle. But the former word is unattested (cf. the lexica of Jastrow and Levy, s.v.), and for the latter we should have expected :,y, as in the text of N (aside from the fact that the Pa'el of :52 seems also unattested). If we accept Diez Macho's questionable suggestion and reject his "certain" one, we have two possible approaches to this text: If l'tr = bazydn = despiser/curser, then we may translate "a despiser of the glory of the divine presence has been hanged" (cf. out (pp. 73-74) that in Mishnaic Hebrew the active participle of verbs whose passive participle is also used "actively" differs often from the passive in that the former "expresses the action as it takes place . . . i.e., its meaning is connected with the future," whereas the latter "expresses an action which took place in the past, or, principally, the state in the present which derives from the action in the past." After one is nrnlw he becomes 'lnw, and after one is nWDK KXW13 he is ,WtK '1W3 (although other factors may account for this construction), but there is no state into which the hanger of a human being (presumably a ,;rln) can be said to have come so that he is a 'Tn 'in. Furthermore, from an exegetical standpoint, Baumgarten's suggestion, even if it were plausible in 4QpNahum, leads to a very strange interpretation of Deut. 21:23. If we translate the clause 'Ifn D'nrTK nL51 ' to mean "the hanger is an offense toward God," we confront the difficulty that the Biblical text mandates hanging, yet the one carrying out the order is offensive to God. The exegesis of TJla, which Baumgarten regards as analogous, does not have this problem. Hanging is indeed offensive to God, according to the Targum, unless the one hanged merited such punishment (nr"r 1011 ''rlln Tnrx). The absence of any such explanatory phrase should probably lead us not to derive any exegesis of Deut. 21:23 from 4QpNahum, until such time as further textual evidence is available. 26 The Makor facsimile, as well as a microfilm available to me, does not aid in clarifying the reading. 27 Cf. also TJI, TJ2, N and Nmarg to Gen. 16:5, rendering 'pKl with forms of 'TM, and perhaps also B.Sanh. 65b nl'',l inw"'" in'T'3. 34</page><page sequence="15">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN the Peshitta's rendering). However, like the Rabbinic exegesis on 45b, the clause does not fit smoothly into the syntax of the remainder of the verse. If T:ta = bizydn = disrespect, then the Aramaic becomes even more awkward: "disrespect of the glory of the divine presence has been hanged," and it is probably this difficulty which led Diez Macho to his emendation of the verb. The tense of the verb as it appears in the text (presumably Ithpe'el perfect) perhaps ought to convince us that the marginal Targum adopted the awkward objective genitive reading, and understand 1'TT as standing for some word meaning "blasphemer" or the like. There remain, before we reach the Temple Scroll, three sources whose positions vis-a-vis the subjective/objective genitive prob- lem are unclear. Targum Onqelos abandons his well-known, if overstated, fidelity to the letter of MT and renders n;rll-pn lnpr ,toY ', ip D n' by n' K KYixnn xKr1 ("You shall surely bury him on that day, for because he sinned before the Lord he was hanged"). Far from allowing us to perceive how he reads 'ln DHrn n517p ', he utilizes phraseology which would be more suitable to ,;nnt /*n 'n' Ktn 'VrK Y; yet no one, to my knowl- edge, has suggested that he had a nonmasoretic Vorlage.28 The classical Rabbinic commentaries to Onqelos were aware of this anomalous translation, and struggled to explain it, but none of them, in my opinion, has proposed a reasonable solution to this obscure text.29 28 A. Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic: IVB (Leiden, 1973), p. 202, lists this phrase among Onqelos' "Changes and Additions in Keeping with Rabbinic Interpretation," but does not enlighten us as to which Rabbinic view he deems similar to TO's. For 3nl' = K1Urn 'Iwr, see C. J. Kasowski, Thesaurus Aquilae [sic] Versionis (Jerusalem, 1940), I, 188b; Biblical words for "curse" are usually represented in TO by some form of V15 or TIl (Af'el); see I, 258b-259a and 475b- 476a, respectively. 29 Onqelos' vague clause has been attributed by some to his unwillingness to take sides in the debate between R. Eliezer and the Sages regarding which sinners are to be hanged (B. Schefftel, Be'ure Onqelos [1888], accepted by Maori [pp. 174-75] and translated by others "for his sin against the Lord he has already received his punishment" [N. Adler, Netina Lager] [1874]). The latter resembles the interpretation of this clause by R. Joseph Qara (cited in A. Berliner, Peletat Soferim [Mainz, 1872], p. 24). It is awkward, since it places a somewhat unnatural meaning on n''UYX and does not tell us how Onqelos understood DnriK n15p. The former assumes intentional obscurity, and furthermore, does not explain 'i DITp. Other Rabbinic commentaries to Onqelos are, to my mind, similarly unsuccessful in attempting to resolve the problem in the text. 35</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW I suggest that if we understand 'nr m-p not as representing the Hebrew ',rn ("before the Lord") in the so-called anti-anthropo- morphic tendency of Onqelos,30 but as describing the particular nature of the sin in this case, a sin directed at/toward God, then the phrase might be considered a euphemism for otLn nKx lTPl=r 5y or ip'n 15:r by, so that TO would be following the view of the Sages against R. Eliezer. This would mean, admittedly, that TO has adopted the syntactically awkward exegesis of the baraita on 45b, but would require no further complicated explanation.31 Such euphemistic usage is, to the best of my knowledge, unat- tested. An additional benefit which might accrue from this tentative interpretation is its potential application to the phrase r' 1r11 'lnin lSKx in TJla, which then also might be considered a euphemism for OlVn nK Tl'rv y or Ip'Y 15Di v Y.32 Although all commentators seem to work with the presump- tion that TO's somewhat enigmatic phraseology is linked to the mainstream Jewish interpretation of t'nrK n5p7 as an objective genitive, a case can perhaps be made for understanding 'r Dtrp n 30 See M. L. Klein, "The Preposition D1ip ('Before'): A Pseudo-Anti- Anthropomorphism in the Targums," JTS, 30 (1979), 502-07, and Anthropo- morphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Targumim of the Pentateuch (Jeru- salem, 1982), pp. 110-24. 31 Y. Komlosh, The Bible in the Light of the Aramaic Translations (Tel-Aviv, 1973), p. 204, explains in a similar fashion, asserting, among other things, the similarity of TO to TJla and Symmachus, neither of which is certain. He does not consider the words of Onqelos as euphemistic, but as alluding to the crime which was committed. 32 Among the moderns, S. R. Driver, Deuteronomy (Edinburgh, 1902), p. 249, assumes that the Rabbinic interpretation "an insult to God" underlies the "ungrammatical paraphrase of O," but does not explain the reasoning which led to this conclusion. J. Reider, Deuteronomy with Commentary (Philadelphia, 1937), p. 202, claims that TO adhered to the Rabbinic interpretation "because he cursed God." Wilcox, p. 87, writes with assurance that Symmachus' "interpreta- tion coincides strikingly with that of Targum Onqelos," F. Field, in his notes to Origenis Hexaplorum Quae Supersunt (Oxford, 1875), I, 304, also claims that Symmachus and Onqelos are similar. Even if the ambiguous phrase in TO does refer to blasphemy, as it very well may, the fact that TO does not call it blasphemy but uses a euphemism should distinguish his version quite sharply from that of Symmachus. Perhaps most to the point is Geiger, p. 58, "Onqelos abbreviated, after his fashion, and left his words obscure ... and we cannot know his intention, whether he explained nrL'5 like the first exegetical opinion that he was hanged because he cursed God, or the opinion of R. Meir that the hanged man is a reproach to God." 36</page><page sequence="17">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN ("guilty before the Lord," reading an as a participle rather than a perfect) as representing the subjective genitive, which is the view adopted by, among others, LXX and Christian exegesis. an would then be a milder substitute for t'*, which we find in Targum Neofiti (where the idiom is 'n r'p tV'). The hanged man would then be "guilty (i.e., cursed) before God," and therefore ought to be removed from exposure in order to avoid contamina- tion of the surrounding area. But the usage in TO would then be highly peculiar, and furthermore, we should then have no grounds for explaining the echo (if it is an echo) in TJla's 113'1 'ln I;ir 1',; that phrase does not lend itself to a subjective genitive interpretation in any way. Aquila and Theodotion translate ,rn nr,K nSr5p ': quite liter- ally 6Tt KaTapa 0Fo6D KcpEC,djEvo ("For a curse of God is [a] hanged [one]"). Driver has assumed that these two agree with the generally accepted (by the moderns) interpretation of r,nKR n517 as "cursed by God,"33 but two factors may militate against this being the case. Jerome, in his commentary on Gal. 3:13, while citing earlier versions of this verse, translates the words of Aquila and Theodotion (whose Greek we know via Procopius) with "quia maledictio Dei est suspensus" and "quia maledictio Dei est qui suspensus est." He does not attempt to bring them into line with LXX's "quia maledictus a Deo est omnis qui pendet," which he adopted in the Vulgate. To Jerome, at least, the versions of Aquila and Theodotion are not equivalent to LXX. The fact that the translation of LXX seems not to be in line with most ancient Jewish exegetical traditions might also raise some doubt as to whether Aquila, who often stands with the mainstream of that tradition, is also diverging from it here. It is more likely that the verbatim translations of Aquila and Theodotion do not allow us to perceive the way in which they read the Hebrew syntax. The ambiguity of objective or subjective genitive in the Hebrew can be said to be reflected faithfully in the Greek.34 33 Driver, p. 249. H. C. Brichto, The Problem of "Curse" in the Hebrew Bible (Philadelphia, 1963), p. 192, and Maori, p. 175, n. 2, seem to accept this analysis. 34 Masius, cited by Field in his Hexapla edition ad loc., writes, "Aquilas vertit ut est in Hebraeo." It is a bit odd that Jerome translates the presumably identical versions of Aquila and Theodotion (cf. A. Voobus, The Pentateuch in the Version of the Syro-Hexapla. A facsimile edition of a Midyat MS discovered 1964 [Louvain, 1975], p. 177r) into nonidentical Latin phrases. 37</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW If we survey for a moment the classical Rabbinic sources for the exegesis of the clause ,'n ,lK * n51p ', we observe both uniformity and disparity. The uniformity consists of the syntacti- cal analysis of the phrase nr,K nij71 as an objective genitive, and the disparity lies in the understanding of the syntax of the entire clause and the translation of its key phrase. For the Sages and R. Eliezer (and those other sources which follow their approach), ,ln is the predicate, "for on account of the blasphemy of God he was hanged." According to R. Meir (and those sources following him), 4'n is the subject, "for the hanged man is an offense to God." This observation of syntactical differences within identical syntactical analyses of orn,K np17 will prove noteworthy when we come to analyze the possible exegeses inherent in the Temple Scroll. The discovery of the sectarian Temple Scroll presented us recently with another ancient Jewish exegetical tradition which apparently views ,nrK nF5p as a subjective genitive. In the running paraphrase of certain Deuteronomic laws in the latter portion of the document, two offenses are said to incur the unusual (at first glance) penalty of hanging: .9D^~~~~~~~ 6 1Yn nY1 7 ty lyl 1D3 q j1 inbY nK ttrw ir1nY V r'K rrrr'' 7 oD'y ;rvijv SD 5yl Dt'yy '3rw '5D y nn1 rY1n Y ilimK lnrnlm 8 xK rnril nln usr vn ' t r' N 'I ryn imr *m n .1m nnri 9 rpn ' y inlmK DA rnmnl r WvIr n nxllv y K 55l DpX1r oilln 10 '3 K1inn t1ri [n]-liipn -lnp 'I ry-n 5y nnn5&gt; 715n K15 nim» 11 vWK ;mnix; nK Ktun lh p ^y y ln Dy i Kt 1 DhKx t'r lp* 12 n^m ns?

I suggest there that the abrupt shift from plural to singular in line 12 is due to an unsmooth interpolation, but my overall discussion of the passage does not affect materially the present analysis of the clause. 36 This reading presumes that '51ij is a Pu'al participle, but there is another possibility worthy of consideration which I had tended to discount until a number of my colleagues defended it, and that is the vocalization of the word as meqolele, a Polel (active) participle. The text would then reflect an objective genitive reading like the baraita or Mishnah and mean "It is the cursers of God and men who are hanged on the tree." The addition of "and men" would then be an exegetical expansion to fit the new law of the Scroll. Blasphemy and the cursing of the Jewish people would then be crimes equally deserving the death penalty of hanging. This suggestion is prima facie quite attractive, being both syntactically and contextually smooth, and I should hestitate to claim that it is impossible. My major reservation is that Qumran Hebrew seems to use Polel forms of geminate verbs only in those instances where the Polel of the verb exists already in Biblical Hebrew (cf. E. Qimron, The Grammar of the Hebrew Language of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Ph.D. dissertation, Hebrew University, 1976, p. 199, #315.8-9, for examples). For 551, at least, the Pi'el participle occurs in lQS 2:4 and 10 (D'5pj) and the Pu'al participle 1'5p719? appears in 4QPs 37 111.9 written plene (with suspended waw) where MT is defective (1'5ab1). I should therefore maintain the reading and interpretation set forth in the text of this paper. 37 Yadin, Temple Scroll, I, 290 and II, 204a-b. Professor Emanuel Tov suggested in a comment on the oral presentation of this paper that the reading of LXX KEKaTrlpd£VOqS 6n6 0coO and of TS D'W3K1 ',1'K '51p may represent a common Vorlage differing from MT. The issue raised by the two possibilities, variant text or exegetical interpretation, is not unfamiliar. In defense of the latter possibility, the following reasoning seems to be demanded: If a translator is not allowed flexibility, in our analysis, to avoid an ambiguous reading, and we always presume that he is translating literally, can we ever penetrate to his understanding of a difficult text? The Hebrew of MT is ambiguous here, and any translation other than a verbatim one will of necessity diverge from it and resemble another Vorlage. The fact that three independent witnesses (LXX, TS, TN) paraphrase 'l5n 1D';n1 n55p 'I with a subjective genitive via a passive participle need not indicate a common textual variant. RaMBaN, who certainly had no text other than MT before him, writes '1nn r K t; 553 1pnl QtI;n 5 n TTK; 'I ("The most cursed of all men and reviled among them is the hanged one")!

Yadin's interpretation is highly dubious; the "double exegesis" of D^nlX nf1p in the Rabbinic texts is not really analogous to his understanding of the passage in the Temple Scroll. While the Rabbis, apparently unanimously, read D^'LX n1p as an objective genitive, there were two clearly distinct ways of understanding the syntactic construction. It is not clear, as we noted earlier, whether both exegeses were ever intended to be taken literally, and it is only in the Mishnah (Sanh. 6:4) that they are even collocated (and perhaps not even there according to Rashi). There is no reason to assume common authorship for the two objective genitive exegeses in Rabbinic literature, or even that the author of one would subscribe to the other. The Mishnah maintains a sort of awkward juxtaposition of the two interpretations only in order to understand the clause '1Ln D^'XK nlp ':3 as a reason for the lowering of the exposed corpse. According to Yadin, the author of the Scroll construes nl5p ' '1n D^'IX in two different syntactical ways in order to obtain his two interpretations, unlike the two exegeses of the Rabbis which bear the same syntactical analysis. Furthermore, both Tannaitic exegeses take into consideration both words in the phrase D^'IX nlj7. If we are to demand this, it is not clear that there are two readings of Do'nT np present in the Temple Scroll. The implicit first exegesis, the derivation of VzY nx 5p' from D^X' np7 (the objective genitive), is particularly tenuous, given the absence of God from the interpretation and a context which has nothing to do with blasphemy. The crux of the Rabbinic interpretation is that one who has cursed God is hanged, not any and all cursers. The sectarian view is not claimed to be any different in this regard by Yadin, and if so, there is no real objective genitive exegesis of D^a'X nf1p in this text. reason to assume that he had Paul's text in Galatians or the LXX/TS Vorlage in mind. In general, the postulation of differing Hebrew Vorlagen on the basis of translations or paraphrases of ambiguous phrases is to be ventured with the greatest diffidence. 40</page><page sequence="21">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN It is perhaps more likely, as Yadin suggests in his note, that the author of the Temple Scroll, rather than interpreting D'nX n5l7 in two ways, is synthesizing in this section Exod. 22:27 'xn K InlY K'xwl bVpn ?K D'TnK and Deut. 21:23. If an inter- pretation of Exod. 22:27a similar to the Rabbinic one (B.Sanh. 66a), equating D',nXK with judges, was known to the author of the Scroll, then both verses could be viewed as using ½Up in a nonblasphemy context. I:y in the Temple Scroll would then be related to pY12 in the verse from Exodus. Furthermore, if, as I have attempted to demonstrate elsewhere,38 the two cases of 64.6-13 in the Scroll are really but two examples of the same law, then imy nx j'i is parallel with 17:Y :1v t'x n'n' ':, both being offenses which involve going over to the enemy and committing a verbal crime against the people, whether by betraying or by cursing. The absence of any references to God and the similarity to the previous case make it very unlikely that there is any conscious "double exegesis" of Deut. 21:23 in the mind of the author of the Scroll. If we concentrate only on that which can be said to be derived from the Biblical text, there is no doubt that the Temple Scroll understands D,nX nTfp as a sub- jective genitive, and any similarity between line 10 and the verse in Deuteronomy, which might have prompted thoughts of the objective genitive, can be considered at most stylistic.39 Although the Temple Scroll shares with LXX, Neofiti, and most Christian exegesis the understanding of aD X n5p as a subjective genitive, there is certainly no need to posit a common source for all of these exegetical traditions. Since the translation is not at all forced, but rather smoothly integrated with the logic of the sentence, and since its syntax is paralleled elsewhere in the Bible, it could presumably have been arrived at independently by the two oldest representatives of the tradition, LXX and the Temple Scroll. In fact, we ought perhaps to distinguish between the exegeses of LXX and Temple Scroll, even though they seem to have the same syntactical analysis of the verse. 38 "Midrash Halakhah" (above, n. 3), p. 149. 39 It may very well be that the expression ~5p'l was suggested to the author by the context of ,;5iKx n155p, but that is not exegesis of the Biblical verse. Betz, pp. 92-93, claims that ;I5Kq n155 is the source for Dyn nl551, but does not prove his assertion adequately. 41</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Whereas it is obvious that LXX, Neofiti, and the author of Galatians understand the Biblical text to mean "accursed by God is everyone hanged on the tree," as the addition of the word "all" (t:, nia) before the word for "hanged one" indicates, the lan- guage of the Scroll certainly supports, and perhaps even suggests, another reading. The Scroll, in my opinion, understands the clause 'ln DnXK n ,: '0 to mean "it is the accursed of God [and men] who is hanged on the tree." For LXX, the hanging engen- ders the curse, whereas for the Temple Scroll it is the reverse. The offenders described in 64.6-10 are "accursed" because of their exceptionally heinous crimes, and only those who are accursed are hanged. If hanging is not the factor which results in the corpse's being cursed, but rather the punishment of one who is already cursed, then the phrase supplies the reason both for the suspension of the corpse and for its lowering. The enormity of the crime merits hanging, but the nearby land ought not be subject to the impurity of the exposed sinner. We might go so far as to note the similarity of this explanation of the Scroll to the interpreta- tion of TJla 'r 1'la '3nin Tonx. Despite the differing syntactic analyses, both consider the heinous nature of the offense as the only reason for exposing a corpse. It should be clear now that there was a good deal of variety in the exegesis of 'ln DTnX nl*p ': in this early period. There are two syntactical readings of the phrase D'nX nflp7, and within each one a further distinction can be made regarding the meaning of the entire clause. It is not clear whether any chronological order can be established for the diverse readings, nor whether the traditions of exegesis align themselves along theological lines. Geiger suggested long ago that the abandonment of the subjec- tive genitive (which he felt was the simple sense of the text) by Jewish exegetes was a response to the use of the verse in the NT as a proof text.40 He postulated a development within Rabbinic tradition from D'nX n5jp meaning DvnX 5 p (which was then followed by Symmachus and the Peshitta) to the view of R. Meir that D',nX nyp means "disrespect toward God." Such an historic progression of Jewish exegesis of this phrase is purely hypothet- ical and does not stand up to close scrutiny. As Maori has pointed out, if the Rabbis merely wished to avoid the subjective genitive analysis stressed by Paul, they had 40 Geiger, p. 57. 42</page><page sequence="23">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN available the syntactically smooth rendering of R. Meir, and there was no need to adopt the awkward analysis of the baraita, B.Sanh. 45b.41 In the light of the fact that the Rabbis' two objective genitive renderings of the clause read it in two different ways, as demonstrated above, it is unlikely that one exegesis derives from the other. Furthermore, Josephus' paraphrase of the verse, if it may be said to reflect exegesis, would attest to the Rabbinic interpretation being current enough by the middle of the 1st century C.E. for him to cite it.42 And finally, a perusal of the classical medieval commentaries to Deut. 21:23 shows that the subjective genitive interpretation was never completely aban- doned in normative Judaism.43 The appearance of the subjective genitive in the Temple Scroll, which with LXX constitutes our oldest evidence, does not, granted the paucity of our sources, indicate chronological priority for that interpretation. Moreover, even granted the priority of the subjective genitive, there is no evidence of a shift in interpretation by the Rabbis on the basis of theological considerations. Contemporary scholarship, in discussing early exegesis of the clause ,'in D;nX nfLp ', in the wake of the passage in the Temple Scroll, has failed on the whole to note that Rabbinic and Targumic tradition had two distinct ways, based on the objective genitive, to interpret the clause, and that one of them (R. Meir and TJlb, and perhaps Sanh. 6:4 and TJla) is integrated smoothly with the remainder of the sentence.44 Strictly speaking, 41 Maori, p. 175, n. 2. 42 We can presume that Josephus did not keep up with the latest trends in Rabbinic exegesis while writing his Antiquities in Rome. 43 R. Abraham ibn Ezra (1092?-1167): "And in the literal manner (UVYD), because God is 'active' (5Y1D) [i.e., the subject of the verb implicit in n557p] and the curse comes from the hanged one to all nearby places." RaMBaN (1194- 1270): "And in the literal manner, it says that should a man be guilty of a great sin, for which it is fitting that he be put to death and hanged because of the magnitude of his sin, nevertheless you shall not leave his body overnight on the tree, for the most cursed of all men and reviled among them is the hanged one" (see n. 37, above, for the Hebrew). Note the similarity of RaMBaN's language to that in the Temple Scroll. Targum Neofiti, too, if its manifestation of the subjective genitive is not a sign of antiquity or of transmission through non- Jewish hands, shows that the subjective genitive reading held a place in Jewish exegetical tradition. 44 Wilcox, p. 87, cites Symmachus, Onqelos [!], M. Sanh. 6:4 (partially) and TJ 1 to Deut. 21:22 as interpreting o';IK n*p1 as equivalent to blasphemy. "The exegeti- 43</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the subjective genitive of LXX and others, "cursed by God," is not superior as a translation to the objective genitive, "disrespect toward God." In a sense, the construct chain is perhaps more literally understood as "disrespect of God" rather than "cursed by God," which requires the transformation of the noun "curse" into the passive participle "cursed." Both translations are syntactically acceptable, and each fulfils the same criterion, namely the percep- tion of 'ln Dn,X ny*p ': as the reason for the lowering of the corpse. The syntactically ambiguous Hebrew phrase gave rise to at least two (three if our reading of the Temple Scroll as differing syntactically from LXX is accepted) readings which give good sense when viewed against the rest of the verse. The failure to comprehend the syntactically smooth Rabbinic exegesis (of R. Meir, etc.) which is probably due to a careless or cursory reading of the Rabbinic and Targumic texts, leads to a skewed perception of the pattern of exegesis of 'ln DnX nbp : which was in vogue at an early date. We are left by contemporary scholarship with the feeling that the Rabbis, for theological or other reasons, were unwilling or unable to produce a syntactically acceptable reading.45 cal point at issue," according to Wilcox, "is whether Dn'51K n55i? means 'cursing God' or 'being cursed by God.'" The rendering "disrespect toward God" does not even occur to him, despite its clear presence in Rabbinic sources. He comments further, p. 90, n. 38, "Apart from possible apologetic motives, the early Jewish traditional sources look at Deut. 21:22-23 from the standpoint of law, i.e., halakah, not from that of haggadah." How does he regard R. Meir's highly homiletical interpretation in the Mishnah (6:4) or the Tosefta (9:7) and its parallel baraita on 46b? The interpretation of Dn'5K np55 in the latter passage maintains the objective genitive exegesis in a way fully consonant with the syntax of the verse. Fitzmyer, p. 507, commenting on the exegesis of our verse in the Temple Scroll, also seems to recognize but one Rabbinic interpretation of D';nl n1l 7 0 '1n, when he writes "the debate whether '1ln D';nK nf5t1 means 'the hanged is something accursed of God' or 'the cursing (= the curser) of God (is) hanged' is clearly excluded. In the course of the Rabbinic debate, blasphemy and idolatry were considered as 'the cursing of God.'" He, too, ignores completely the other interpretation of D'nTK nSK 1 as "disrespect toward God." 45 What is particularly disturbing about the failure to take cognizance of the totality of Rabbinic exegesis of this verse is the fact that both Rabbinic readings survive in patristic literature. For example, the translations {i3ptS Toi 0Eco and kXoiopia Toi 0oE ("insult of God" and "reviling of God," respectively), cited by Jerome (op. cit.; above, n. 5) and the lengthier comments of Isho'dad of Merv 44</page><page sequence="25">EARLY JEWISH EXEGESIS-BERNSTEIN If we may hazard a hypothesis as to why the Rabbis preferred the objective genitive analysis to the subjective (aside from any theological argument), we might explain it as follows: The Midrash-halakhic interpretation of D;X nfl p as referring to the blasphemer, based as it is on the objective genitive, influenced the reading of the text on the straightforward level. Because of the Midrash, the syntactically similar reading "disrespect toward God" attained a position of prominence over the subjective genitive "cursed by God." Rather than viewing the Rabbinic exegesis as diverging from an interpretation attested in LXX and in Qumran and prominent in the early church, we should study it as representing one of a number of approaches to this text which existed in an exegetically pluralistic world.

Graham [Chicago, 1913], pp. 233-35). I hope to deal with later exegesis of this verse, both Jewish and Christian, in a subsequent paper. 45</page></plain_text>
