OPPENHEIMER Biological Laboratories, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania 19010 ABSTRACT Selected earlier contributions by the author concerning the development of Fundulus are reviewed. These concerned the normal development of the egg, and vital staining and transplantation experi- ments. The transplantations involved grafting of portions of the shield or the germ ring either to the shield or yolk-sac epithelium of gastrulae the same age as the donors. Grafting of portions of the germ ring to the yolk-sac epithelium led generally to negative results. Grafting portions of either germ ring or shield into the shield itself led to the differentiation in the hosts of many supernumerary structures, which were frequently surprisingly well organized. This was true also for grafts of shield material implanted onto the yolk-sac epithelium, even after they had been minced or otherwise fragmented. The results indicate that the Fundulus gastrula has considerable ability to regulate. Study of the behavior of hatchlings, reported in the 1950's, suggested that the central nervous system also has considerable powers of regulation, since when the brain contained accessory parts and was larger than normal, the functional behavior of the hatchlings was less disturbed than might have been expected. New results presented here for the first time report the study of hosts, carrying brain grafts, that were allowed to develop to adult stages. Of 21 specimens into which shield grafts had been implanted at gastrula stages, and which had been allowed to develop to the adult stage, 5 maintained brain grafts of appreciable size attached to or forming part of the primary brain. INTRODUCTION T H HE HALF CENTURY of Fundulus embryology that I am writing about is not very scientifically measured; it began not in 1929 but in 1927. What I propose to cover is mainly some of what I myself have done with Fundulus. My work has followed two threads that are really rather complicatedly intertwined, and I do not believe that anyone else has tried to unravel their relationships or even knows that they have any. My starting date of 1927 does not refer to when I began to study Fundulus eggs; I was still in high school then. I first examined them in 1931, the summer after my junior year at col- lege, when I was enrolled in the embryology course at Woods Hole. What happened in 1927 0033-5770/79/040385-11/$1.35.

That year Nicholas (1927) reported on a method that he had devised for removing the chorion from the egg. His trick was to use a pair of especially sharpened iridectomy scissors, with one point longer than the other, so that once the long point had penetrated into the perivitelline space it need not again be re- moved. Once in, the blade could be slipped between the chorion and the egg without touch- ing the very delicate vitelline membrane, or the blastoderm, and a cut made and extended at will. The hard problem was to have the point narrow and sharp enough to penetrate the chorion without touching the egg itself. Among the non-virtues of the Fundulus egg as experi- mental material is the excellence of its yolk, once its membrane is ruptured, as a medium supporting bacterial growth. After the embryo is formed and the yolk covered with cells the hazards are reduced. The principal experi- ments performed by Nicholas were done at stages after the primitive organ-systems were laid down. He extirpated the fins, sense organs, and portions of the nervous system, none of which regenerated. Actually, experimental work on Fundulus goes much farther back than the 1920's. T. H. Morgan, when he was an embryologist, and an Associate Professor at Bryn Mawr College, in 1893, pierced the chorion with a sharp needle and destroyed one blastomere at the 2-cell stage. He found that the remaining blastomere could form a perfect embryo, smaller than normal, but larger than half-size (Morgan, 1893). He also separated the embryo from the germ ring (Morgan, 1895) to disprove the old theory of concrescence - a dead dog now - a fact worth mentioning only because some of the resulting embryos in Morgan's experiments had diminished somites on the operated side. There were others who confirmed and extended his experiments on the egg working through the chorion, but we shall not go into their results. Morgan's work was technically the cleanest and clearest by far. NORMAL STAGES I shall begin with brief reference to two arti- cles that show what Fundulus eggs look like. The most modern stage series is that of Armstrong and Child (1965), who published drawings of successive stages of eggs raised at a constant temperature of 25?C, and their Figs. 1 to 20 show stages from before the time of first cleavage until the time that the yolk is completely covered by the various layers that envelop it. When I began to work in the 1930's, there was no stage series available, and I made a prelimi- nary set by photographing dechorionated eggs (Oppenheimer, 1937). In the 1930's em- bryologists were not yet working at constant temperature, and those eggs were developing at summer room temperatures, often at 90?F or above. The comparable photographs (Op- penheimer, 1937, Figs. 1 to 16) are far less crisp than the Child and Armstrong drawings. They show, however, much more convincingly than do the drawings exactly what the eggs really look like when they are being examined and manipulated microscopically, at least in the conditions of illumination under which I oper- ated. In the living egg the embryonic shield does not have a nice distinct edge around it, as in the drawings. Its limits, as in the photo- graphs, are so vague as to be sometimes almost indistinguishable, and are further obscured by the brilliant reflection of light from the surfaces of the numerous lipid droplets which are inclu- sions in the yolk. These droplets rarely, under operating conditions, resemble the nice neat lit- tle black thin-walled circles seen in the draw- ings. A set of diagrams explaining the early development of Fundulus is found in Figs. A through J. EARLIEST TRANSPLANTATIONS I began by transplanting what then, for better or worse, was considered the equivalent of the dorsal lip of the amphibian blastopore, al- though as Ballard (1973b) has told us, correctly it is not a blastopore. It had been so-called for several generations, and I was not as smart then as Ballard is now so I did not correct the error. The result of the transplantations was the ap- pearance of new embryos or their parts (Op- penheimer, 1936a; see especially Figs. 1 to 12). This was interpreted as the manifestation of inductive effects such as those that Spemann had shown for amphibians and Waddington for chicks. It was still our fashion then to look for a vertebrate type, though any of us acquainted</page><page sequence="3">DECEMBER 1979] FIFTY YEARS OF FUNDULUS 387 Y Y Y A B C Y D E F E (X,.) ff:ES'ES 6 H IJ FIGS. A-J. SCHEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF SUCCESSIVE STAGES IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE BLASTODERM TO THE EMBRYO IN Fundulus heteroclitus The blastoderm (B) slowly expands over the yolk (Y), as is shown in Figs. A, B and C. As gastrulation commences (Figs. D and E) the cells are piled up at the periphery of the blastoderm to form the germ ring (G.R.) and the embryonic shield (E.S.); the central portion of the blastoderm becomes the extraembryonic membrane (E.M.). During the course of gastrulation the blastoderm gradually covers the yolk (F, G, H, I); late in gastrulation a refractile streak (N) visible in the shield represents the keel of the central nervous system. Fig. J shows the extent of embryonic differentiation a few hours after the yolk is completely covered; 0. V., optic vesicle; F. B., forebrain; M. B., mid-brain; H. B., hind-brain; N. C., nerve cord; S, somite; M, unsegmented mesoderm. The egg is drawn in profile in all figures except Fig. E, which represents the stage shown in Fig. D seen from the animal pole.

By now, even the interpretation that the effects were inductive has been questioned by Brummett (1968), who thinks the grafts may just have self-differentiated. Fundulus embryos are poor at holding vital stains, but they maintain them long enough so that if a graft from a Nile- blue-stained donor is transplanted into a neutral-red-stained host, it becomes evident that the responding cells are red, as Op- penheimer (1936a, Figs. 7 and 8) reported. Fig.</page><page sequence="4">388 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 54 1 (ibid.) shows the reverse, a case where a red graft was placed into a blue host. When I began my work, Harrison advised me that I should not work on teleosts. He was right. The cells do not hold localized stain well, and they are too small. A third problem is that one cannot separate prospective germ layers at early stages in Fundulus (if indeed there are any such, which is now not so clear). When I tried to separate them and could not, it did not then occur to me that there might be no layers to separate. I blamed their apparent inseparability on my own ineptitude because I had no reason to doubt that they - or at least some of them- were there. Those of us who first studied Fun- dulus development at Woods Hole used H. V. Wilson's Embryology of the Sea Bass as our Bible, and his careful and seemingly accurate draw- ings clearly showed a layer of cells involuting at the rim of the shield (Wilson, 1889, Figs. 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48). Well, that was in 1889. In 1935 an equally careful worker, Luther (1935, Fig. 7) showed that the transplantation of a similar separate involuted layer could induce new ner- vous system, indeed whole new embryos, in the European trout; and in experiments equivalent to Spemann's he also exchanged prospective ectoderm with prospective nervous system with results similar to Spemann's (Luther, 1936, Figs. 1, 3). The results of transplantation of portions of the advancing lip of the Fundulus shield pro- vided the main basis for my own dissertation. It was not the problem I had been assigned. ATTEMPTED VITAL STAINING Nicholas, who was my mentor insofar as my dissertation was concerned, had wished me to trace the Fundulus cell lineage by vital staining. This was not a meaningful enterprise; even Morgan's experiments had shown the egg to be regulative. A sort of map was tentatively worked out, but because of the non-separability of the lower layers it was hardly very definitive. The stains all penetrated the outer covering layer to reach the shield cells below. There seemed some similarity to the amphibian pat- tern, in that prospective nervous system was anterior to prospective notochord (Op- penheimer, 1936b, Fig. 3). Two wings of mesoderm seemed to converge towards the midline of the shield, as was known already from the defect experiments by Morgan that we have previously mentioned, which showed that somites were diminished in size when the germ ring was separated from the shield. Thus these areas had been suspected to be fated for mesoderm long before Vogt's maps for the am- phibian had ever been dreamed of. The area for the Fundulus nervous system is not a wide crescent as in the amphibian, or as in the Euro- pean trout studied simultaneously by Pasteels (1936). Perhaps most important, the results demonstrated definitively that cells entered both nervous system (Oppenheimer, 1936b, Figs. 20A to C) and a lower layer (presumably mesoderm since the stain ended up in somites) at the anterior end of the shield (ibid., Figs. 26A to D). This hardly fits the amphibian plan, as was emphasized in three papers (Oppenheimer, 1935a, 1935b, 1936b): An article in Science con- cluded by pointing to "proof by direct observa- tion that during gastrulation cellular materials pass from extra-embryonic regions into the shield at its anterior part" (Oppenheimer, 1935b, p. 598), and a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the same year emphasized that "the occurrence of [this] phe- nomenon in Fundulus suggests that induction may occur independently of actual invagina- tion" (Oppenheimer, 1935a, p. 553). Ballard in 1973 acknowledged the demonstration of the addition of material from the center of the blas- toderm to the forebrain region of the shield in Fundulus but did not mention the contribution to the mesoderm (Ballard, 1973a): Ballard and Dodes (1968) had previously referred to this obliquely. I think no one else ever referred to the differences I had pointed out between fish and amphibian, only to the similarities. So much at the moment for the anterior end of the embryo. There is another unsettling as- pect of it at the posterior tip. My vital staining experiments suggested that the part of the germ ring 1800 away from the axis of the em- bryo participated in the formation of the tail- bud in Fundulus (Oppenheimer, 1936b, Figs. 24A and B). Brummett (1954) studied the movements of this part of the germ ring, in a dissertation written under my guidance, but in- stead of using vital staining as a marker she used carbon particles, as Spratt had done in the chick. Using this improved but still imperfect method she found that the 1800 germ ring did not enter the embryo or the tail at all in Fun-</page><page sequence="5">DECEMBER 1979] FIFTY YEARS OF FUNDULUS 389 dulus. This still leaves open for explanation some strange results of grafts of 1800 germ ring, two of which, when implanted anteriorly into the shield, formed distinctive tail structures (Oppenheimer, 1938, Figs. 16 and 17). Both Brummett and Ballard have discussed the dis- crepancy, but it has not been completely ex- plained. GERM-RING GRAFTS As just implied, some attempts were made to transplant parts of the germ ring. Portions of the germ ring removed 900 or 1800 from the embryonic axis were grafted either to the extra-embryonic epithelium or to the shield it- self. These experiments will now be briefly taken up. In fact, not much was ever learned about the germ ring by grafting it. The two little tails made by 1800 germ-ring grafts were excep- tional. Neither 900 nor 1800 germ ring grafted to the yolk-sac epithelium of host gastrulae the same age as donors differentiated organs. Sometimes these, and sometimes other grafts that did not accomplish formation of organs, did make erythrocytes accompanied by a few melanocytes and occasionally a xanthocyte (Oppenheimer, 1949). I refer here to grafts taken from areas that do not normally differ- entiate neural crest or hematopoietic tissues, placed in areas that do not do so either - one, for instance, was a 900 germ-ring graft develop- ing in the host pericardium (Oppenheimer, 1938, Fig. 10). To be anthropomorphic, it looks as though grafts find it easier to differentiate these tissues and cells than structurally more concrete and complex tissues and organs. How do you explain it in terms of molecular genet- ics? If germ-ring grafts do not differentiate em- bryonic organs when implanted on the extra- embryonic membrane, they might not be ex- pected to do so when grafted into the shield. However, their presence there resulted in the formation of multiple and abundant super- numerary organs and tissues by the regions of the shield into which they were implanted (Op- penheimer, 1938, Table 1). It is a further mis- fortune of the use of Fundulus material that one can only surmise which of the accessory organs were formed by the host and which by the grafts. But when germ-ring grafts were im- planted into the shield, the hosts differentiated accessory brain, ear, notochord, gut, spinal cord, and somites, or some combination of these, with frequency; more rarely, extra fins were formed, as were pronephric duct and car- tilage. Why such extensive differentiation of extra parts resulted from placing implants of germ ring into the shield, when these were so unproductive when grafted onto the yolk-sac epithelium, is an interesting question which no attempts have been made to pursue. My own subsequent efforts were devoted to grafts of material from the shield itself. SHIELD GRAFTS Shield grafts were also made either to the yolk-sac epithelium or to host shields of gas- trulae the same age as the donors. In the early 1950's, grafts of fragments of the shield representing four antero-posterior levels were implanted into the prospective midbrain or hindbrain regions of gastrulae of the same age as the donors (Oppenheimer, 1955a, Fig. 1). The most frequently differ- entiated supernumerary structures included brain, spinal cord, cartilage, eye, auditory vesi- cle, striated muscle (segmented and non- segmented), oral or pharyngeal epithelium, in- testine, and notochord. These were formed in association with grafts from the appropriate parts of the shield. Perhaps the most unex- pected result was that when accessory gut was differentiated, the secondary gut in more than expected frequency opened into the primary gut (Oppenheimer, 1955a). In 13 of 19 cases (68%) secondary intestine established junction with the primary alimentary canal. The per- centage of like joining like for segmented mus- cle was 11 per cent, for unsegmented muscle 39 per cent, for notochord zero in the same mate- rial, so there is something special about the gut, and there is evidence of its having migrated actively to achieve its junction with the primary alimentary canal. I think that these results have received little attention. Perhaps here too there is something to re-examine now that what used to be called affinity is investigable at molecular levels. Homing activities, to put it figuratively, could be ascertained for one other constituent of Fundulus embryos, at an entirely different level. To take these up it will be necessary to return briefly to the germ-ring grafts. It will be</page><page sequence="6">390 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 54 remembered that when these were placed into the shield, accessory brain parts were usually differentiated; these were usually joined to the primary brain. As will be familiar to many, the teleost brain typically contains one pair of giant neurons, Mauthner's cells, located in the medulla near the level of entrance of the eighth cranial nerve. Their axons decussate and turn to run posteriorly in the cord adjacent to a fiber tract that is the posterior prolongation of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Twenty-two supernumerary or ectopic Mauthner's cells were found in the brains under discussion, and twenty-one of the axons could be followed (Op- penheimer, 1941). Eighteen entered the host spinal cord, and thirteen of these occupied their usual position adjacent to the prolongation of the medial longitudinal fasciculus; two were nearby in the ventral cord, and three were somewhat more dorsally in the cord adjacent to the lateral longitudinal fasciculus (Op- penheimer, 1941, Table 1, Figs. 1 to 20). This work has been continued by others, and a num- ber of explanations of this remarkable phe- nomenon have been postulated, none com- pletely satisfactory. In any event, such success- ful selectivity on the part of these axons awakened my interest in the central nervous system, and for the rest of my experimental life I continued to investigate aspects of the devel- opment of the central nervous system, either alternately or simultaneously with my studies on the organization of the blastoderm. Now back to the shield grafts. In the 1950's grafts of quarters of the shield were made to the yolk-sac epithelium (Oppenheimer, 1959a). These resulted in the differentiation of a range of structures even greater than did comparable implants to the shield (Oppenheimer, 1959a, Table 1), and as might have been expected from the results of grafting the shield lip in the 1930's, well-organized tails were often formed as a result of the implantation of the most pos- terior shield sections. Complexes differentiat- ing after grafting anterior parts of the shield never developed heads as complete and as highly organized as were the tails. One interest- ing feature of the tails was that they sometimes contained ectopic ears: a number of auditory vesicles, which usually reside in the head, were posterior rather than anterior to the pectoral fin (Oppenheimer, 1955b, Figs. 2 and 3). Ear for- mation is known to be governed by highly com- plicated factors in amphibians, but when audi- tory vesicles have turned up in tails there, it was most often under conditions when abnormal inductors were employed. Here is one more unsolved mystery. By the 1950's, new fashions of embryological experimentation had become popular, and the activities of disaggregated cells had become of more interest than the differentiation of whole grafts. At first my attempts to follow along in this direction were limited to the implantation onto the extra-embryonic shield of minced grafts. For these experiments, the shields of middle gastrulae were divided into three rather than four parts, in order that each be large enough to work with. Fine cuts were used to divide each of the respective thirds of the shield into nine parts each, by making two cuts parallel to the long axis of the shield and two transverse to it. The nine fragments were dislocated with respect to each other by jumbling them at ran- dom, and then were assembled into single units. In most cases, anterior or posterior rather than middle portions of the shields were used for these grafts. Thirty-four of the hosts reached the hatching stage, or near to it. There was a slightly higher incidence of trunk and tail struc- tures in this series than when the grafts had been unminced, and a slightly lower frequency of differentiation of head structures. The to- pographical arrangement of the embryonic parts was sometimes (not always) almost frighteningly close to normal, and so indicated extraordinary powers of regulation (Oppen- heimer, 1959b, Figs. 1, 3, and 4). My attempts at reaggregating completely dis- sociated fragments of the shield, and then graft- ing them, did not succeed. There was no prob- lem about dissociating them with EDTA, and then collecting the separated cells in a small capillary closed at one end and centrifuging them down into a pellet. I was never able to extricate the pellet of cells intact; someone with more dexterity could no doubt have done so. I settled for next best, which was to partially dis- sociate the shield fragments by immersing them into calcium-free, magnesium-free amphibian Ringer's solution. In this series of experiments, anterior and posterior halves of shields of mid- dle gastrulae, rather than thirds or quarters, were used. The isolates dissociated into sepa- rate cells and cell clumps (Oppenheimer, 1972, Fig. 1), which were then collected in a fine capil-</page><page sequence="7">DECEMBER 1979] FIFTY YEARS OF FUNDULUS 391 lary tube filled with double-strength Ringer's solution with a double complement of calcium and magnesium ions. Under these conditions many of the free cells and clumps adhered to- gether to provide a unified group that could be removed as a whole from the capillary and then grafted to yolk-sac epithelium. It was never pos- sible to retrieve into the final aggregate all the components of the half-shield that had been dissociated. Complexes formed by or associated with grafts derived from posterior shield portions frequently formed tails, and differentiated, with few exceptions, into the same range of structures described earlier as having differ- entiated when either unfragmented or mechan- ically minced shield portions were grafted. In the parts of the new graft complexes remaining attached to the yolk-sac epithelium, the second- ary structures formed were often in topo- graphic disarray, but in the free tails that grew out from these complexes, the axial structures frequently attained normal topographic rela- tionships (Oppenheimer, 1972, Fig. 12). Complexes associated with grafts derived from anterior shield portions frequently formed, among other structures, highly differ- entiated eyes, often with normal retinal strat- ification, sometimes accompanied by lens, cornea, iris, or optic nerve or a combination of these (Oppenheimer, 1972, Figs. 4, 14). There is at present no explanation of these extraordi- nary results, which demonstrate the remarkable powers of self-organization of eyes by anterior disaggregates and of free tails by posterior ones. There is something in the front of the shield that likes to organize eye formation, and something in its rear that likes to see to it that tails organize themselves. DEVELOPMENT OF NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ASSOCIATION WITH GRAFTS No one who observes the differentiation of Fundulus grafts can avoid being occupied with the nervous system because almost all the grafts result in its formation, and when it is formed there is a lot of it. Eventually, therefore, I car- ried out a series of studies in which the brain and central nervous system were the primary focus of interest. This series of investigations, which had begun with the Mauthner cell studies in 1941, was continued into the 1970's, and the results of my final experiments will be reported here for the first time. The fish embryo is par- ticularly satisfactory for the study of central nervous system differentiation. The brain and spinal cord are very highly structured in terms of the topography of their parts, and the ar- rangement of fiber tracts and internal brain nuclei is elaborate (Oppenheimer, 1950, Figs. 1 to 8). It is easy to distinguish what part has been formed by secondary brain in a graft either to shield or yolk-sac epithelium, and that in fairly minute detail (ibid., Figs. 15-19); at least, it is far easier than in the amphibian, where most of the cell bodies tend to be central and most of their fibers peripheral to them. It will be remembered that in the experi- ments reported in 1938, grafts of 900 and 1800 germ ring implanted into the shield resulted in the differentiation of accessory parts, including brain. When I was working with living embryos during the breeding season I always examined each experimental embryo microscopically at least twice a day, when I came in in the morning (often very early) and when I left at night (often very late). In the living hosts carrying germ-ring grafts to the head, I did not observe, or at least record, any observations that suggested that the behavior of the hosts -behavior in terms of mobility - was atypical. I was therefore amazed, when I examined the sections, to see that accessory brain parts had often developed in conjunction with the primary ones. This had not been expected from what was visible of the host brains. The early experiments relating to the organization of the blastoderm that I had performed up to that time had suggested the differentiation of the embryo to be highly reg- ulable, and as is evident, this was confirmed by the later experiments. These embryos from which the data reported in 1938 were gathered suggested that the same might be true of the central nervous system as an entity. Accordingly, experiments were repeated in which grafts were made to the shield in such a way as to optimize the probability of accessory brain parts differentiating in conjunction with the primary ones. Most of these grafts were derived from prospective brain regions of the shield and an attempt was made to implant them into prospective brain regions of the host. This time, development of the locomotor ac- tions and reactions of the hosts was more care- fully studied, though not yet quantitatively, in</page><page sequence="8">392 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 54 unhatched and in newly hatched embryos. The time of onset of motility was noted, as were deviations of the postural tonus of the longitu- dinal trunk musculature (kyphosis, lordosis), the presence or absence of swimming movements, their direction if they took place, the presence or absence of righting reflexes, coordination of eye movements, and other such modalities of behavior that need not be specified here. The sections of the preserved hatchlings were silver-impregnated, and it could be ascertained that fibers passed between primary and secon- dary brain parts. The degree of functional regulation differed considerably among the individual hosts. In some hatchlings there were disturbances of locomotor, postural, and righting reflexes, or of coordination of eye or mouth and branchial movements; in others functional regulation seemed complete. In some cases deficits in behavior could be correlated with specific rearrangements of visi- ble structure pattern; in others, no such correla- tion was apparent. In general, the disturbance of behavior was not commensurate with the morphological disturbance in the central ner- vous system. In fact, what was most remarkable was that the embryos developed at all. It was concluded that the developing central nervous system can integrate more than the usual amount of material into an orderly functioning whole, and that the fundamental pattern of its organization is such as to allow considerable regulability (Oppenheimer, 1950). Shortly after these results were published, a quantitative study (Oppenheimer and Vassady, 1956) was carried out to ascertain whether brain size may have been a factor affecting the degree of regulation which took place in the operated embryos. Paper reconstructions of sections of forty-five of the brains reported on in 1950 were made and weighed. The variance of the relative weights of the brains of the reg- ulating group did not differ significantly from that for the nonregulating group (ibid., Fig. 1). Accordingly, it was concluded that the size of the brain was not a critical factor influencing regulation in these experiments. The quantita- tive results confirmed that functional regulation occurred in atypical brains significantly larger than the normal. The final, and not completely successful, ex- periments in this series repeated the grafting experiments that had resulted in excess brain; in this series, however, the hosts were main- tained until they reached the adult stage. When I first performed grafting experiments in the 1930's and 1940's, they were deliberately ter- minated at the hatching stage, or soon after, because of the hazards of losing the hosts if they were kept longer. Among the dangers then were spoilage of the medium (fresh sea water) in which they were maintained, and the intro- duction into it and into the hatchlings of mold by the dry food then commercially available. By the 1970's, Ocean Salts were readily available commercially, as were mycostatic drugs, and Artemia eggs and Tubifex worms were easily obtained, and when the hatchlings were being raised in the 1970's, they could be fed living food exclusively. A number of hosts benefited from these conditions to reach adulthood. The heads of twenty-one adult specimens into which accesssory prospective brain material had been grafted during gastrula stages were sectioned. A number of the sections are in- structive. Of the twenty-one adult heads, five still had appreciably large accessory brain parts at the time of preservation; two are illustrated here (Figs. 1, 2). Two of the five positive speci- mens had been operated in 1972 and three in 1973; all were preserved in 1974. Seven em- bryos into which comparable grafts had been implanted were fixed earlier as controls, one before hatching and six as hatchlings. The fry shown in the middle in Fig. 3 shows what the accomplishment of one such hatchling can be. The specimen at the left, unoperated, was preserved and photographed at three days post-hatching; it had a normal brain, and had not yet fed at the time it was preserved, having lived until then on its own yolk. The large specimen at the right of the figure was pre- served and photographed at 56 days post- hatching; it lacked an eye removed at an early optic vesicle stage. The fry in the middle is the one that interests us. It was 43 days old post- hatching when preserved. Its brain graft is still visible externally. In spite of the bend in its body it was able to pursue living Artemia dex- terously enough to have grown very consid- erably. The graft proves to have become medulla continuous postero-laterally with that of the host. Subjective observations were made on the behavior of these intermediate stages of the fry</page><page sequence="9">DECEMBER 1979] FIFTY YEARS OF FUNDULUS 393 FIGS. 1 AND 2.

The specimen at the right had been experimentally deprived of one optic vesicle at an early stage, but is approximately the size of unoperated Fundulus of the same age raised under the conditions of these experiments. (up to 3 or 4 weeks after hatching), when their behavioral repertoire is more diversified than at hatching. These observations confirmed that at least at this age fry with brains having accessory parts could develop normal behavior patterns (e.g., righting reflexes; normal swimming; swimming up and down along streams of air bubbles; catching swimming Artemia as prey, which requires considerable speed and delicate coordination; taking worms from medicine droppers, which involves conditioning). The most striking results, as for some of the hatch- lings described in 1950, was that some of the advanced fry with asymmetrical brains swam and performed these various other activities without showing asymmetry of movement or of posture. There is no way of knowing why less than a quarter of the adults had grafts. Perhaps some of the grafts did not take. The reconstruction study confirmed that the visibly external shape of the brain in dorsal view does not always re- flect the presence of accessory parts. It is possi- ble that in some cases the accessory brain was</page><page sequence="10">394 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 54 rejected and resorbed. One way in which the accessory brain in the adult heads differed from that in the hatchlings was that in one or two of the adult specimens a not inconsiderable por- tion of the graft was separate from that of the host. In Fig. 1, for instance, a wall seems par- tially to separate the primary and secondary brain. This is true only for some regions of the graft, not all. If such separation of secondary from primary brain in fact represents a stage in graft rejection, it is very late indeed; the speci- men was a full adult, a year and a half old, when preserved. CONCLUSIONS Many, if not all, of the experiments I have reported, and others which I have not had the time to describe here, were extremely crude. That is only partly due to the deficiencies of the Fundulus eggs. It was I, and not Fundulus, who designed and performed the experiments. There have been rewards, however, provided by the reactions of the eggs and embryos to the butchery they have undergone: the homing in- stincts of the endoderm and of Mauthner's axons; the atypical differentiation into blood and pigment cells of otherwise nondifferentiat- ing grafts; the development of ectopic ears; tails growing out of heads; the unexpected nature of some of the so-called morphogenetic move- ments. All of these provided surprises and added zest to the work. But most important, the demonstration of the dramatic powers of regu- lation of the embryo as a whole during early stages of differentiation, in particular as shown by the superior quality of the eyes and the tails formed or induced by the minced or otherwise subdivided grafts, and the functional regulation that the developing brain can accomplish, fur- nished my real reward, and they pose questions about the relations of parts to wholes that are still important in days when embryologists work with molecules unassembled into eggs, or resi- dent primarily on their membranes.
