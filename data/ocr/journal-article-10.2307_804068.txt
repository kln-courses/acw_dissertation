New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1929. Pp. 355. $2.50. Time flows staunchlessly like blood from a mortal wound in this stream of con- sciousness story of the war-born, staccato tempo of the love of an American soldier in the Italian army and an English nurse. Speed and the war shattered Katherine Bar- clay through the death of her English lover. Speed swept her into Lieutenant Henry's arms; speed moved him to a shattering wound in the wild drive north, and threw them into the sweet intimacy of lovers during his long winter convalescence. After Ca- poretta they escaped from the war to an Alpine dream-world in Switzerland, and life called to life as Katherine's unborn child gave them growing realization of the meaning of their love-dance together. In every line and movement of the book there is an extraordinary impression of reality that labels the Victorian shibboleths, truth, justice, honor, not so much adolescent as senile dodderings. Life grips us; we dance and we die. All Quiet on the Western Front. By Erich Maria Remarque. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co. There are only two wholly significant answers to all the searching questions that men may ask to seek out the meaning of the World War: Under Fire, by Barbusse, and Nichts Neue im Westen. In the first of these the subtle complex flair of the French mind was thrown like a star shell against the sky, and now after a decade comes this simple, courageous story of what flesh and blood and spirit endured while humankind was caught in the slow, crushing cogs of the great war. The leperous destruction of the inner life slowly drained away the illusions that bear men through their days until at last the death of the physical man came as a hard-won and desperate relief from the agony of life devoid of meaning. The Hawbucks. By John Masefield. Chicago: Macmillan Co., 1929. Pp. 236. $2.50. Here is the same gusto in physical contest, in a vile villain and a blameless hero, in frenzied love inspired by feminine beauty, as in Masefield's previous prose ro- mances. The use of a single realistic English parish as background, and purely English personnel, chiefly gentlefolk, naturally throws more emphasis upon manners and char- acter. Plausible and absorbing on first reading, the reflection doubts the villain and re- jects the similarity in the half-sisters Maid Margaret and Carrie. In one of the three fox hunts a fox runs for nine pages. Short Stories out of Soviet Russia. Compiled by John Cournos. New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. 206. $2.50. Written simply and directly by men who can hold no property, these stories show intense feeling about life, fierce human relationships, and dramatic seizure of the pleas- ures and brutalities of the moment. They deal usually with the peasants and the city poor. Brief biographies of the authors, mostly young men, are included.</page><page sequence="2">176 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL Chariot Wheels. By Sylvia Thompson. Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. 307. $2.50. The story of the marriage of Cresida Stobart, a young girl who finds that she cannot waive her conventions of monogamy, and Lester Midge, a novelist whose devo- tion to his wife is second to his devotion to his many loves. The character of the wife is cleverly drawn. Her death and his reaction, in the midst of his grief, to a lilting voice over the telephone supply a sardonic climax. Class of 1902. By Ernst Glaeser. New York: The Viking Press, 1929. Pp. 397. $2.50. A sympathetic view of the lives of German boys whose early teens fell during the World War. Those youths who through their most impressionable years suffered from perverted sex ideas, hunger, and the sweeping-away of moral and social barriers now form a large group of disillusioned men. Harriet Hume. By Rebecca West. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. 275. $2.50. A satirical fantasy concerning a politician "of no family" but possessed of a mocking conscience in the form of a woman who flits in and out of his life. The style is, according to one's sense of humor, stilted and hazy or poetic and epigram- matic. The description of the successful politician's life in his luxurious home is shrewd, and the climax highly fantastic. This Man's Army: A War in Fifty-Odd Sonnets. By John Allen Wyeth. New York: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. 60o. $2.00. Crystallizing a war--or certain intensities of the war--in fifty sonnets that com- bine the sharp sweep of shell-fire, the staccato of machine guns, the retch of vin rouge, casual terms of thought, easy colloquial soldier talk, and air raids. To read the book is to heighten the effect of the intense tragic spectacle, as a child watching a play through cracks catches here and there flashes that he pieces into a whole. Nearly all an insane world--but a little just bittersweet. Chief of the Herd. By Dhan Gopal Mukerji. New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. i68. $2.50. An anthropomorphic story of an elephant leader in the Indian jungle, beginning with the rescue of his herd from capture and ending with saving them from ivory- hunters. Between lies his experience of marriage, of family, of bereavement. The writing is uneven--at times powerfully graphic, at others failing the illusion of reality, occasionally descending to moralizing for young readers. TEACHING The Winged Horse. By Joseph Auslander and Frank Ernest Hill. Garden City, N.Y. Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. 451. Addressed to the wide world as well as our schools, this story of poetry will ap- peal alike to the inexperienced and those victims of pedantry for whom poetry has come to mean pretense. The scope of the field extends from prehistoric days through Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, Tennyson, and the Brownings to Masters, Sandburg, Elinor Wylie, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. There are excellent reading lists appended</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS 177 giving references to anthologies, biographical and critical studies of poetry, and a find- ing list. The Winged Horse Anthology is a companion volume of readings. Personality Adjustments of School Children. By Caroline B. Zachry. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1929. Pp. 306. $1.8o.

An excellent technical discussion of sound rhythms, representation of speech rhythms, pattern of verse and line, and the history of music and verse. TEXTS AND READINGS Adventures in Literature. Books Seven, Eight, and Nine. Edited by J. M. Ross and H. C. Schweikert. New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1929. PP. 744. Carefully graded selections from English and American literature suited to the tastes, interest, and abilities of junior high school pupils. Ample provision has been made for varying individual abilities and the range of material is adapted to the ex- ploratory nature of the reading suggested for junior high school in modern, as well as classic, literature. Attention has been focused on carrying over the influence of the school to life outside the classroom. The fundamental proposition of the Twenty- Fourth Yearbook that teaching of junior high school literature should be extensive and not analytical is made a basic feature of the readings. In accordance with this, the mastery tests included are intended not as formal class exercises, but for the profit and amusement of the pupil during his preparation. With a very few exceptions, no excerpts from long stories or poems have been used. Science in Literature. Edited by Frederick Houk Law. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1929. Pp. 364. $1.20. Twenty selected readings from such chief contemporary figures as William Bee- be, Garrett Serviss, E. E. Closson, Millikan, and James Harvey Robinson. Edited for school use.

Representative selections of fourteen great English prose-writers from Bacon to Stevenson, excluding English fiction. The arrangement is chronological, and the in-</page><page sequence="4">178 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL dividual selections have been tied together and equipped to tell their own story as a history of English prose. This is done by a prefatory biographical and critical essay introducing each author to his readers and brief selective bibliographies giving the principal editions of the writers' works, together with biographies and interpretative essays. In this connection there is a general introduction to the subject of English prose-writing dealing with the earliest period and a series of chapters which carry on the story from period to period and fill the gaps between the notes for study. Brief notes explain difficult words and local and personal items of literary and intel- lectual background. The Chief Modern Poets of England and America. By G. D. Sanders and J. H. Nelson. New York: Macmillan Co., 1920. Pp. 705. $2.25. Representing more fully than has been attempted before the work of fifteen contemporary British and eleven American poets.

Junior and Senior High School Speller. By Ethel G. Ward. New York: Amer- ican Book Co., 1929. Pp. 128. Sixteen Spelling Scales and The Teachers' Wordbook are the authorities on which the selection of words has been based in this modern spelling text. The groups of words are planned to hold attention on single spelling difficulties long enough to diagnose a pupil's trouble and help him overcome it. There is much interesting ma- terial for dictation provided, both in the textbook and in the manual for teachers, so that training is given in ability to spell and the mind is principally occupied with the ideas being written. Chapters are given on word-building, Latin prefixes, and the spelling difficulties encountered in confusing, difficult, and technical words.</page><page sequence="5">BOOKS 179 An Outline of World Literature.

Wil- son Co., 1929. For debate and report work. Secretarial Procedure. By Stella S. Center and Max J. Herzberg. New York: Ronald Press Co., 1929. Pp. 401. $3.25. Secretarial Procedure aims to establish immediate, direct contact between the student secretary and actual business situations and so shorten the gap between train- ing and practice. The unique and vital feature of the work is the survey and job analysis on which the book was built. This involved observing the secretarial posi- tion from the viewpoints of the employer, the personnel director, and the secretary. Part I is a series of case-study narratives of secretarial practices as they were found in the survey. Each is a lucid, vivid, sketch of the hour-by-hour and day-by-day conduct of a secretary's life. Part II supplies the secretary with the information which the survey indicates is essential to effective communication. Specific attention is given</page><page sequence="6">I80 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL to secretarial service in public-utility companies, retail furniture stores, travel bureaus, insurance offices, advertising agencies, publishing companies, welfare organizations, export and import houses, metropolitan newspapers, banks, department stores, and architects' and law offices. There is an excellent chapter on employment conditions which will be read with interest by experienced secretaries and with penetrating at- tention by the inexperienced.

By Edith Mirrielees. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1929. Pp. 230. An effective, sincere approach to the problem of writing short stories, developed through courses in story-writing at Stanford University and the Breadloaf School of English. The work is built with the conviction that imaginative writing is high- ly and permanently valuable to college students, that young men and women in teens and early twenties are capable of sustained, effective work in fiction, and that workers in creative literature may gain much by learning what principles fellow- workers have discovered and the devices they have found useful. The plan of the book includes chapters on "Preparing the First Draft," "The Required Repetitions," "The Time," "The Underlying Idea," "The Point of View," "The Characterization," "The Verbal Revision," "Increasing the Writing Chance," and an Appendix containing excerpts from The Pit and the Pendulum, The Travelers Story of a Terribly Strange Bed, and The Minister's Black Veil.

Answers and good reasons enough to persuade high school seniors or undergrad- uates of the modernity and unfailing appeal of Shakespearean drama. But more than this, the book is written with all the vivacity and sparkle of charming conversation; it is so well-informed and thoroughly competent in its comments on the modern stage--on Ellen Terry, Gordon Craig, as well as the classic figure of Edwin Booth- that it should find an eager audience among secondary school teachers of Shake- speare everywhere. There are eight excellent illustrations. The Study of Poetry. By Paul Landis and A. R. Entwistle. New York: Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, 1929. Pp. 306.
