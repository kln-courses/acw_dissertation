<plain_text><page sequence="1">JACQUES LEZRA Spontaneous Labor For John X. LaPorta Consider the project outlined in the openingpages of Reading "Capital" to "illuminate . .. from within [Capital], as the exact measurement of a disconcerting but inevitable absence, the absence of the concept ... of the effectivity of a structure on its elements which is the visible/ invisible, absent/present keystone of [Marx's] whole work."' The pos- sibility of illuminating, let alone measuring, agency or effectivity from within a text, however broadly defined, is very much in the balance today, as it was between 1963 and 1967, when the "anthropological" Hegelianism current in Europe after the War came into question most severely. The effects of that questioning remain manifest in and as the confrontation of the vocabularies of humanism, culturalism, and stra- tegic essentialism (among others) in discussions of the futures of the Marxian legacy, discussions whose practical means may well prove to have been their most fruitful theoretical end: the constitution of their own incompleteness as a provisional object of knowledge, or as a con- cept. To put it differently: the work of "measurement" opened by Balibar, Althusser, and Macherey radically unfinished, in Balibar's pro- vocative term, the possibility of reflecting upon Marxism as a system of concepts ("life," "class," "history," the "party," "mode of produc- tion," and so on), whether subsumed under the notion of practice or under that of theory. It also posed that act of reflection as an unavoid- able ethical as well as a theoretical necessity-as a rule-in any thought on agency or effectivity. What follows here is principally descriptive: what is the nature, and what are the determining conditions, of this double task of unfinishing and of posing reflection? The task turns first upon an understanding of 1. Louis Althusser and Etienne Balibar, Reading "Capital," trans. Ben Brewster (London: New Left Books, 1970), 29. YFS 88, Depositions, ed.

In its roughest form, this is hardly news: the "history" of philoso- phy, the "history" of the production and constitution of the concept of philosophy, is the "history" of the battles waged over the concept itself (the German Begriff differing in important ways from conceptus and its declensions). The term holds in postwar philosophical debate the con- tested place that came to be occupied in the social sciences by the words structure and function; indeed, the crises of each discipline can be charted in the changing destinies and unhappy marriages of the three terms. I take the contradiction, if it can still be called that, between a functionalist theory of ideology attributed to Althusser (manifest, for instance, in the notoriously misunderstood constitution of the subject as Trager, position-marker or carrier of ideological "sense") and an aesthetics of the concept to signal the care with which the possibilities of agency and effectivity begin to be drawn, in these first strong challenges in France to the hegemony of the language of subjective consciousness, against and within the vocabulary of the concept.2 For much of what is most disturbing-or "traumatic, " to use Slavoj Zizek's word-about the project of Reading "Capital" lies in the measurement or the enactment of a profound hesitation in the traditional determination-in the history-of the concept itself. "A conceptus," writes Kant of Begriff in the Vienna Logic, "is a raepresentatio communis, which is common to many things"-an entirely conventional description of abstraction from the manifold that leaves undecided on what grounds conceptus is to be distin- guished from "thing," and whetherraepresentatio is to be taken in one or the other of the classical senses most often associated with it: as mere representation or appearance [Erscheinung], or as the appearing of the common essential in the manifold.3 The discussion in the First Critique of the transcendental grounds upon which abstraction or synthesis must rest sharply qualifies the unproblematic use and eli- sion of raepresentatio and of "things," and ultimately of anthropos 2.

The statement in the opening of the "Transcendental Analytic" is well known: No knowledge is possible without a concept . .. and a concept is al- ways, with regard to its form, something general, something that can serve as a rule [Regel]. Thus the concept of body [vom Kdrper] serves as a rule to our knowledge of external phenomena, according to the unity of the manifold which is thought by it. It can only be such a rule of intuitions because representing, in any given phenomena, the neces- sary reproduction of their manifold elements, or the synthetical unity in our consciousness of them [daBi er bei gegebenen Erscheinungen die notwendige Reproduktion des Mannigfaltigen derselben, mithin die synthetische Einheit in ihrem Bewufitsein, vorstellt].4 The movement from the notion of the communis to the concept's use here as a rule signals the transition from an ontology to an ethics, the language of necessity [die notwendige Reproduktionj serving as a straddle between formal or transcendental knowledge and its practical outcome for bodies, or, in other words, as a bridge from the first to the second critiques. The status of the rule-which the First Critique describes elsewhere, powerfully, as a riddle [Ratsell-in these lines is equally important for, like the "necessity" with which it is coupled, it is neither empirical nor transcendental. Rather-and Kant's formula- tion is very precise-the concept is necessarily always, as to its form, what can serve as a rule [zur Regel dient] uniting concrete contents, a servant or handmaiden [Diener] that makes the rules. This hesitation helps to explain why the concept, both a self-evidently shared repre- sentation and a rule, is perennially at issue in left-Hegelian thought: in the lesser Logic as well as in the Philosophy of Right, Hegel explicitly draws the connection between this ambiguous "service" performed by the form of the concept, and the "service" or slavery by means of which knowledge of "external phenomena, " in Kant's terms, becomes a genu- ine phenomenology of spirit: 4.

On the contrary they really are, as forms of the concept, the vital spirit [lebendige Geist] of the actual world. That only is true of the actual which is true in virtue of these forms, through them and in them.5 The characteristic inversion of "life" and "death" in these lines cannot quite mask the difficulty Hegel takes from Kant: if it is neither empiri- cal nor transcendental, if it is a raepresentatio as both mere appearance [Schein] and as translucence of the essential, if it is a rule that serves, how can the opening formality of the concept be known as such, and how can this knowledge then affect "life" or the "actual"? This problematic circularity, which turns upon an elision of "ob- ject" and "concept" remarked powerfully by Heidegger, still marks and defines the form as well as the "actual world" of the genealogy of the concept.6 The passage in the First Critique's brief definition from an extensive sense of body as res or extensio ("Thus the concept of the body [Kdrperl . . . ") to the restricted, anthropomorphic sense as corpus marks one such elision, and the programmatic line from Read- ing " Capital " with which I opened, which proposes to "illuminate ... from within [Capital], as the exact measurement of a disconcerting but 5. Hegel's "Logic," trans. William Wallace (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), 226. I have modified the translation to reflect the generally accepted terms for the Hegelian originals (from notion to concept, for instance, and from constituent functions to moments). The ontologization of logical form in Hegel is a persistent and indeed characteristic maneuver, as the introductory discussion of Begriff in the Science of Logic makes clear. See also the remark to paragraph 160 of the lesser Logic, which also treats the "inferior view" that "generally reckons the concept a mere form of thought" (223ff ). 6. The conflation of "object" and "concept" has its own problematic in the Phe- nomenology, as Heidegger shows: see, in his "Hegels Begriff der Erfahrung," the com- ments on paragraph 12 of the "Introduction" to the Phenomenology, which makes clear that for Hegel, object and concept are moments in a dialectical movement, and thus fundamentally nonidentical. Heidegger's role in setting the terms for the critique of this "progressive" notion of the development of the concept in Hegel is notoriously over- determined: it is no accident that the project of Being and Time founders at the point where the discussion of Begriff in the Enzyklopidie begins. Hirst and Hindess comment that epistemological Marxism "depends on the conception of objects existing indepen- dently of knowledge yet in forms appropriate to knowledge itself," and derive from a critique of this epistemology the understanding that "there are no basic concepts" in Marxism or in any other theoretical discourse.

For just as the production of the concept has to be distinguished starkly from the abstraction of the concept, a dialectical procedure whose roots in ide- alism Marx quite correctly signaled, the project of "illuminating an absence" has to be distinguished from the project of Husserlian phe- nomenology, for which "absence" is precisely that which cannot be "illuminated" as such, but only as the determinate absence of some- thing else, of the object of knowledge not-yet-there. The formal diffi- culty is classical: if judgments about objects or particulars produce (that is, reveal) the concept of the "manifold elements" in the object, they also produce (that is, generate or fashion) the concept as an object. What will always be excluded from judgment will be the concept of this double proposition, for the "manifold elements" of the concept of "production" cannot themselves be subordinated a priori to the "syn- thetical unity of our consciousness." If the concept is produced (or its absence illuminated), there can be no a priori concept of the produc- tion of the concept: and this "absence," which fundamentally unfin- ishes the formal project of reading Capital and of Reading "Capital," cannot be "illuminated" in the same sense as one speaks of "illuminat- ing" the absence of a concept of effectivity. Part of what constitutes the double task of unfinishing and posing reflection is the proposition that the formality of the concept is not materially embodied, not allegorized or figured after its formality is known, but that in some way that formality itself has a material, an- thropomorphic status-the sort of project Althusser could well have inherited from Merleau-Ponty, for instance. This anthropomorphism, however, is something other than a common ground or raepresentatio communis. The relation between anthropos and morphe is not the source of a rule of generality, but the spot where any synthetical unity, and hence any subjective sense of agency or effectivity are subordi- nated to what I can, hastily, call the occurring of a material allegory, or an allegory about the occurring or appearance of matter. This difficulty is soon shown to structure the field of political agency as well, either in 7. The interplay of the languages of visibility and reading suggests a close reading of Merleau-Ponty's Le Visible et l'invisible (ed. Claude Lefort [Paris: Gallimard, 19641), published posthumously and based on a series of courses, dating to the mid 1950s, that Althusser knew well.

That no conventional, or rather, no democratic form of political organization can be derived from either alternative may help to explain Althusser's well-known turn toward the philosophical task of "pos- ing" or positioning theses. This is no help, however, in the second aspect of the question: whether bodies as a result are "objects" or "concepts. " Let me, as I try to tease out Althusser's place in recent attempts to address these questions, return again to a brief review of the terms in which the debate over the concept was posed, the hesitation over the notion of rule was received, and the effort to separate its "regard to form" from the "concept of the body" it concerns was treated. The very familiarity of the terms, of course, is deceptive, since the disguised persistence of "effectivity, " or of "metonymic or structural causality, " or of the term "concept" itself in contemporary critical discourse can- not be detached from the various narrative forms (of origin, of revolu- tion, of return, of confession) that inflect that persistence. Never- theless-and setting aside, for the moment, what consequences this inflection might have for our "life," as well as for the work of Reading "Capital "-we recall, in a first formal approach, that the target of Al- thusser's first exploration of the relation between epistemology and materialism is not Kant but the "philosophy of the concept" associ- ated most commonly with the Young Hegelians, and against which Marx begins to develop what he hopes will be a genuinely materialist dialectic. Of Hegel's various definitions of the concept, the apodictic passage in the lesser Logic is the most notorious, and perhaps the most fruitful, since the assertion that "the Concept is the principle of free- dom, the power of substance self-realized" functions both as a defini- tion and as a way of anticipating the ethico-political elaboration of the logic of essence to be found in the Philosophy of Right.8 The attributes of this "principle of freedom" include, among others, its distinction from both the mere representation and from the Idea of a thing, its 8.

Still, it is the aspect of self-realization [die fur sie seiende substantielle Macht] proper to the concept that proved most influen- tial, and most troubling. The being-for-itself of the concept, which the Logic describes as "an independence which, though self-repulsive into distinct independent elements, yet in that repulsion is self-identical, and in the movement of reciprocity still at home and conversant only with itself," sketches by means of this "movement" the complex dia- lectical oscillation between attribution and essence, between con- cretum and generalia that is the condition of possibility of judgment and of individuality. This "movement," Hegel argues, constitutes a form of totality "in which each of its moments is the very total which the concept is."9 The "moment" of individuality, which is embodied in the form of the judgment [Urteil] linking subject and predicate, depends upon this relation of mediated identity to the concept of which it is a "moment." One can see the attraction of the doctrine of the concept for the younger Marx. Because the "individual" judgment in its authentic form bears a relation of mediated identity to the concept (of class, for instance, or party, or historical moment), it becomes possible to de- scribe concrete situations (again, both historical and philosophical) as having a greater or lesser degree of identity with the determinants of that situation. Consciousness in this (primarily Lukacsian) reading becomes, as in Hegel, both what registers the difference between the concrete situation and the concept, and the resultant of the identity between the two. The unease of this formulation reflects the very impasse upon which Marx will break with the Idealist tradition, and which the well-known lines from Althusser's "On the Materialist Dia- lectic" express as a critique of Hegel's understanding of the status of the concrete: It was absolutely necessary to come this far if we were to recognise that even within the process of knowledge, the "abstract" generality with which the process starts and the "concrete" generality it finishes with, Generality I and Generality III, respectively, are not in essence the same generality, and, in consequence, the "appearance" of the Hegelian con- cept of the autogenesis of the concept, of the "dialectical" movement whereby the abstract universal produces itself as concrete, depends on a 9.

At its most pow- erful, "On the Materialist Dialectic" recognizes between the "mo- ment" and the concept a fundamental discontinuity that threatens the logic of essence: the "real transformation" that takes place between the "abstract generality" and the "concrete generality" requires and produces a material transformation in the object and subject of knowl- edge. But this coupure also deepens an apparent hesitation, at issue as early as the Phenomenology of Spirit, concerning what Althusser's lines translate as the "autogenesis" of the concept: the concept is at once presented as self-realization (at the level of ontology) and, at the level of history, as itself product, product in particular of the labor [Arbeit] and the fear [Furcht] of the Slave. 1 1 By dividing the autogenesis of the concept (its fur sie seiende) from its moments, Althusser rein- troduces not only the category of matter into the dialectical, organic "movement" of the concept, but also a form and a condition of labor (and of fear, let us not forget) that remain permanently alien from themselves. And yet at the same time as they begin to develop this fundamental indeterminacy within the epistemology of the concept, "On the Mate- rialist Dialectic" and, later, Reading "Capital" provide an analogy intended, apparently, to cover and explain the coexistence of a "real transformation" with an epistemological continuity between objects 10.

Kojeve's importance in the understanding of the Hegelian Concept in postwar philosophical thought cannot be stressed enough. His explication of the Master-Slave relation in particular, in Introduction a la lecture de Hegel (Paris: Gallimard, 1947; edited in English as Alexandre Kojeve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel, assembled by Raymond Queneau, ed.

Persistently offered and as persistently dis- avowed in much argumentation indebted to the cryptic description of commodity fetishism in Capital, this analogy understands the produc- tion of the object of knowledge from the "real" or concrete object to be like the ghostly extraction of the commodity-form from the material. In Althusser, famously, this process of "constituting" returns to the Hegelian vocabulary of "determination," adding only a qualifying "in the last instance," which has served, if anything, to exacerbate the sense that the terms mask a strong contradiction. For it is far from clear how a "genuine transformation," a "difference in essence" distin- guishing generalities can yield nevertheless to the mediation of the practice of theory-an objection that can be made in resolutely Kant- ian language: the "object" as such is no more accessible to "knowl- edge" after (both logically and temporally) it has "become" an object of knowledge than "knowledge" as such is accessible in the world of objects. Theoretical practice is then required to retain for knowledge the ghostly form of the object as such alongside, or within, the object of knowledge that it has become-although this ghostly form cannot itself be in the same sense an object for knowledge. As "On the Mate- rialist Dialectic" imagines it, theoretical practice is not only funda- mentally discontinuous, but also and to the same extent the source of metaphoric vocabularies that function therapeutically or ideologically to mask those very discontinuities.12 Around this promise-whose closeness to delusional pathologies affecting individuals no less than political organizations should be noted-turn the strongest recent treatments of the critique of the concept, whether explicitly indebted to Althusser, Macherey, and Bali- bar or not.13 In part, the trend toward new versions of psycho-Marxism represents a critical rehabilitation of arguments made by Michel Pecheux in France, and by the Screen group in Britain, in the early 12. Marx's description of the "fantastic form" assumed by social relations embod- ied in commodities pertains here, especially the necessary recourse to "the mist- enveloped regions of the religious world" for a vocabulary on which to base an under- standing of the "Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour."

Much of Macherey's recent work has indeed focused on this question, as does Balibar's examination of the relation between "mass, " "class, " and "idea." It is upon the problem of the status of the concept in Hegel's language that the Slovenian school has staked its sense that linguistically oriented forms of argumentation are effectively re- pressing the "traumatic kernel" in the dialectic of essence.</page><page sequence="10">JACQUES LEZRA 87 1970s, that pose theoretical thought at the crossing of the question of the unconscious and the possibility of democracy. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the group of scholars and activists surrounding Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, but including also Slavoj Zizek, Mladen Dolar, and others, takes for its point of departure in analyzing the field of social relations a critique of an indexical system of psychoanalytic "reading" indebted strongly to the notion of "lecture symptomale" posed in Reading "Capital. "14 The disillusionment of Althusser's early proponents (Hindess and Hirst, among others), the argument reads, derives in part either from a misreading or from an effective repression of a "traumatic kernel" in Althusser's work. Whether for one or the other reason, the flight from Althusser's effort to reconstruct the "ef- fectivity of a structure on its elements " understood that project finally to privilege either the "structure" (leading to a valorization of a func- tionalist theory of ideology, and politically to the form of closure asso- ciated with Stalinism) or the "elements" (leading to a theoretical hu- manism in line with Eurocommunism) rather than their relation: the problem of the concept of effectivity. 15 The difficulties that attach to determining the place and function of the term "determination" in 14. It is not accidental, though the filiation to Lacan is distorting, that we hear in Dolar and tizek an echo of Macherey's Theory of Literary Production: "A true reading ... ignores none of this multiplicitiy. Above all it involves-beyond an enumer- ation of constitutive elements-seeing, rather than linkage, harmony or unity, which are deformations and idealisations, the reason of its process. It is not, once again, a question of perceiving a latent structure of which the manifest work is an index, but of constituting the absence around which a real complexitiy knits itself." The argument here is stark: reading understood as "seeing"-voir-takes in the first instance the shape of seeing a "reason" rather than a structure or a unity; in the second it becomes divided between mere perception-percevoir-and an act of production or constitution. At the same time, the temporal scheme is given with great compression: it is in practice impossible to distinguish whether the complexity of the real "knots itself " [se nouej around an "absence" that already knots itself; or whether the constituting of this ab- sence provokes, like the retrospective clustering of symptoms around a trauma, this knitting/knotting. Macherey's language thus suggests the extent to which a vulgarized psychoanalytic model is being rejected. The "manifest" work's connection to its "la- tent" absence is understood to involve not the semiology of an index [indice], whose stability rests upon being a phenomenal representation as well as a material part of what it signifies, but on a process or a procedure: the transposition of the model of "produc- tion" or "constitution" of an absence upon the process of analytic recollection of psychic "work" is in question.

Theoretical practice, even in this schematic understanding, prom- ises a relation to fiction or fantasy not easily squared with its function in the materialist dialectic.'6 For it is precisely in its connection to fantasy that the term "determination" ceases to provide the determin- able sense of ideological closure that these critical fictions or critical lives most urgently require. Beginning with Hegemony and Socialist Strategy, for example, Laclau and Mouffe narrate compactly the trajec- tory of Althusser's thought on social relations as a descent or retreat from the possibilities opened by the concept of overdetermination. The story is immediately recognizable, and it is especially important for Laclau and Mouffe because it functions as a synecdoche for Marxist thought more generally (with the exception of Gramsci, but including their own work prior to Hegemony and Socialist Strategy): as a result of its analytic rigor, Althusser's thought is able to posit the indeter- minacy of the category of totality, and of the category itself; but it must retreat from that position for reasons that are not only pragmatic, but also theoretical. Much of the engagement and retreat that Laclau and Mouffe outline suggests the sort of strong but ambivalent reading of Hegel that Colletti had already suggested. I want to linger for a mo- ment, however, on the most economical of their formulations of this scheme: [T]he most profound potential meaning of Althusser's statement that everything existing in the social is overdetermined, is the assertion that the social constitutes itself as a symbolic order. The symbolic-i.e., overdetermined-character of social relations therefore implies that 16. Indeed, for both Althusser and Lacan, as David Macey has recently argued, the notion of the "concept" was tied to a particular moment in the intellectual history of the postwar-and especially to the work of Canguilhem. Macey's argument that Althusser elects to withdraw from the increasingly conceptualized language of the Cahiers pour 1'analyse group toward the realm of "fantasy" is of interest here, in great part since it suggests a movement contrary to the one Laclau and Mouffe propose: toward a region that is not determinable "in the last instance," but whose temporality remains indeter- minate. See David Macey, "Thinking with Borrowed Concepts: Althusser and Lacan," in Althusser: A Critical Reader, ed. Gregory Elliott (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1994), 142- 58, especially 151ff. Rastko Mocnik argues ("Ideology and Fantasy," in The Althusserian Legacy, ed. E. Ann Kaplan and Michael Sprinker [London: Verso, 19931, 139-56), in line with ?izek and others, for understanding Althusserian ideology as "'working upon' fantasy.... Being a quilting-point, fantasy punctually connects the ideological facade with its specific exterior: so-called social reality" (151-52).</page><page sequence="12">JACQUES LEZRA 89 they lack an ultimate literality which would reduce them to necessary moments of an immanent law.... This analysis seemed to open up the possibility of elaborating a new concept of articulation, which would start from the overdetermined character of social relations. But this did not occur. The concept of overdetermination tended to disappear from Althusserian discourse, and a growing closure led to the installation of a new variant of essentialism. This process . . . was to culminate in Reading Capital.17 So, in any case, the story goes.'8 Two things about this description are immediately striking. The stress on overdetermination as the defining characteristic of the symbolic does some violence to the elaboration in Althusser of the concept of underdetermination, especially as it is described in the "Soutenance d'Amiens." In the second place, the as- similation of the field of the symbolic to the "lack of an ultimate literality" is posed as enabling the undoing of "reduction" to an "im- manent law." These tactics significantly, and characteristically, as- similate the concept of "literality" to that of "essence" by means of the term determination, which is understood to condense a set of parallel determinations: the semantic determination of the figurative by the literal; of the representation by the concept and ultimately by the referent; of "articulation" (Laclau and Mouffe) by precisely the sort of "articulating subject" that seems banished from Althusser. And yet, as surely as the "literality" of a symbol is not the same as its "essence," the horizon of the "ultimate" lack of literality of the symbolic does not in itself guarantee that a different order of literality cannot "install" other variants of essentialism (including an essentialism of the figure, for instance). If social relations "lack an ultimate literality," this is to say that the process by which they can be said to stand for something- 17.

As told in only slightly different terms by 2izek, it is a powerful, convincing story: "In Hegel ou Spinoza? Macherey maintains that Spinoza's philosophy must be read as a critique of Hegel-as if Spinoza read Hegel and was able to answer the latter's critique of 'Spinozism'. The same could be said of Hegel in relation to Althusser: Hegel outlines in advance the contours of the Althusserian critique of (what Althusser pre- sents as) 'Hegelianism'. Moreover, Hegel develops the element that is missing in Al- thusser (the one that had prevented him from thinking through the notion of overdeter- mination); that is, the element of subjectivity that cannot be reduced to imaginary (mis)recognition qua effect of interpellation-that is to say, the subject as S; the 'empty', barred subject."

Thus the project of "elaborating a new concept of articulation" will also always be interminable- unless, that is, the "elaboration" of the new concept occurs indepen- dently of (that is, cannot be determined on the basis of) the semiotic aspect of social relations. Laclau and Mouffe continue: If the concept of overdetermination was unable to produce the totality of its deconstructive effects within Marxist discourse, this was be- cause, from the very beginning, an attempt was made to render it com- patible with another central moment in Althusserian discourse that is, strictly speaking, incompatible with the first: namely, determination in the last instance by the economy. [Hegemony and Socialist Strategy, 98] It is here, where the unexpected recourse to the language of totality most clearly suggests a degree of uncertainty, that the originality of Laclau and Mouffe's project becomes evident, and that their distance from Hindess and Hirst is most strongly marked. Associated through- out Hegemony and Socialist Strategy with a conceptual Hegelianism that the work regularly links to an occlusive sense of "determination, " "totality" is reintroduced as a desirable possibility-the "totality of deconstructive effects." To produce this "totality" of effects requires, presumably, that no effort be made to make the overdetermination of the symbolic "compatible" with the order of determination in the last instance, and that the interminability of "elaboration" be understood not as what Idealist philosophy calls a "bad infinity, " susceptible to no understanding and to no totalization, but a "good" one: the simplest form of subsumption of "difference" or contradiction into identity, the "simple infinity" also called the "absolute Concept" in the Phenome- nology.'9 The difficulties that such an effort poses are perhaps too evident: if "the last instance" can be understood to be the horizon of any act of judgment, then assigning it a concrete condition of possi- bility (determination by the economic) seems to require us to subordi- 19. See especially Miller's translation of paragraph 162 of the Phenomenology: "This simple infinity, or the absolute Concept, may be called the simple essence of life, the soul of the world.... It is self-identical, for the differences are tautological; they are differences that are none. This self-identical essence is therefore related only to itself; 'to itself' implies relationship to an 'other', and the relation-to-self is rather a self- sundering; or, in other words, that very self-identicalness is an inner difference."

Miller (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), 100.</page><page sequence="14">JACQUES LEZRA 91 nate to those conditions what we experience and understand as the present constellation of social relations. The "overdetermination" of these relations is secondary, from the point of view of judgment, to their predetermination. And yet, from the point of view of experience (that is, from the point of view of the phenomenology of the subject), the predetermination of social relations remains (permanently) a mat- ter of hypothesis, their "secondariness" itself "secondary" to an expe- rience of "actually existing" social relations. It is ideology, then, that steps into this sharp disjoining of the conditions of possibility of judg- ment and of experience, making them "compatible" both in principle and in the last instance. "Incompatibility" differs in this way from the more productive sense of a rupture or a contingent judgment that Laclau and Mouffe outline, but any reliance upon the notion will reintroduce categories perhaps best abandoned. "Incompatibility," which becomes merely a first moment in the inevitable production and reproduction of ideol- ogy, bears for this reason a most uncomfortable similarity to the organ- icist determinism of a work like Lukaics's History and Class Con- sciousness. For if Hegemony and Socialist Strategy is to "elaborate a new concept of articulation" without making that process of "elabora- tion" into a form of determination or of ideology, it must retain the disruptive force of "incompatibility" without subordinating it to the organicism of a theory of production or reproduction, or to an inter- minableness that relies finally upon a "good infinity" linked indis- sociably to the doctrine of "bad" totalities that Laclau and Mouffe seek to avoid. It must retain "incompatibility," then, without dissevering judgment from experience-that is, without abandoning the possibil- ity of the production of the concept. Into this knot, and in the place occupied in Althusserian epistemology by the notion of ideology, Laclau and Mouffe introduce the psychoanalytic process of capiton- nage, quilting or suturing, which Jacques-Alain Miller elaborates, in "Suture (Elements of the Logic of the Signifier)," from the work of Lacan. Statements about suture necessarily bear marks of syntactical strain, since the "elaboration" of its concept takes place only in and as the paradoxical combination of future and perfected past. "Suture," it seems, is not a form of "determination"; it is not "an attempt [by a subject] to make compatible," but a node of fantasy that produces the subject position; and it is not (yet) an "object of knowledge"-that is, a concept. It has, instead, to be understood as the improperly conceived ground upon which a miscognized [meconnu] subject is acted and can</page><page sequence="15">92 Yale French Studies act, can "affirm" within a contingent, rather than a determined, hori- zon. For this reason, the marks of "suture" do not make a determined "totality" of the overdetermined field of symbolic social relations. Fantasies or symptoms elaborated at the level of the cultural or social signifier, rather than at the level of an "ultimate literality" that "would reduce them to necessary moments of an immanent law, " these points mark the unforeseeable locations at which different, often competing, discourses devoted to describing the field of social relations (the lan- guages of feminism, of cultural materialism, of aesthetics, of episte- mology) will suddenly show themselves to have become articulated.20 The fullest development of Miller's discussion of suture has until recently been in the arena of psychoanalytic vocabulary.2' From the point of view of an "unfinishing" of reflection, or of the possibility of elaborating a radically democratic politics or philosophical practice, the concept of suture and its utopian companion, the horizon of an "unsutured" social field, seem equally promising.22 Always bordering 20. Gramsci is the crucial figure in this, especially at moments when he follows Engels in dismissing the mechanistic sense of historical determination characteristic of "pocket geniuses" who reduce the "infinite variety and multiplicity of history" to economic schemes. Gramscian "philology," the "methodological expression of the im- portance of ascertaining and precising particular facts in their unique and unrepeatable individuality," operates side by side with "more general 'laws of tendency"' for practi- cal, not theoretical reasons. This stress on the practical "co-participation" of these schemes radically distinguishes Gramsci's work from the sort of "reduction ... to nec- essary moments of an immanent law" that Laclau and Mouffe correctly address. See Antonio Gramsci, "Problems of Marxism, " in Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith (New York: International Pub- lishers, 1971), 428-29. 21. Compare, however, Macherey's discussion of the effort to read Hegel in Freud, "Le leurre h6g6lien," Le Bloc Note de la Psychanalyse 5 (1985): 27-50. 22. Laclau and Lilian Zac have more recently clarified the political stakes of the use of suture: "There are signifiers occupying this point of suture in a particular political field. Let us take the case of the policy of disappearance put into effect by many Latin American dictatorships. The signifier 'desaparecidos' occupies a central place in the political field, where various discursive threads are knotted. On the one hand, the au- thorities tend to deny the existence of any desaparecidos; all government arrests have been executed according to the legal framework. Thus, the desaparecidos as a category are excluded from the world of objects. On the other hand, the authorities recognize their existence but deny responsibility for their disappearance.... As a result of these two operations, these desaparecidos inhabit a space where they are neither dead nor alive; they can reappear, they can also be killed. Their death and their life is suspended, deferred. And by means of this operation fear is installed into that context: the desaparecidos point to the existence of another space, a space of suspension, which is both part of, and excluded from, the realm of 'society,' and, in this way, it becomes necessary to define its limits."

Miller, opening his influential essay, links his discussion of Frege to the relation between "objects, " "concepts, " and the process of "determination." In fact, Kant's discussion of the concept is very much at issue as well: An object only has existence in so far as it falls under a concept, there being no other determination involved in its logical existence, so that the object takes its meaning from its difference to the thing integrated, by its spatio-temporal localisation, to the real. Whence you can see the disappearance of the thing which must be effected in order for it to appear as object-which is the thing in so far as it is one. It is clear that the concept that operates in the system, formed solely through the determination of subsumption, is a redoubled concept: the concept of identity to a concept.23 Miller goes on to identify this redoubled concept with the zero in Frege's numerical system-the place of a lack, and a lack that is the quilting point at which the subject, or what can be called subject- effects, can appear. The distance from Hegel seems unbreachable: the disappearing of the thing [chose], insofar as it is one, is not the disap- pearance of the immediate object-for-itself, to be subsumed in a medi- ate object-for-consciousness; much less does the ex-centricity of the thing with respect to the object become in its turn determinable, thinkable, for a subject.24 And yet the "determination of subsump- tion" that Miller describes retains an unmistakable filiation to Hegel's apparent solution to the problem posed by the unknowable formality of the concept. The phenomenological "integration" of the thing to 23. Jacques-Alain Miller, "Notes on Suture," 27. See Laclau and Mouffe's remarks on Miller, by way of Stephen Heath's commentary: "As Stephen Heath points out, 'suture names not just a structure of lack but also an availability of the subject, a certain closure.... The stake is clear: the 'I' is a division but joins all the same, the stand-in is the lack in the structure, but nevertheless simultaneously, the possibility of a coherence, of the filling in.' It is this double movement that we will attempt to stress in our extension of the concept of suture to the field of politics" (Hegemony and Socialist Strategy, 88). The derivation from Frege to some extent obscures the transcendental line: see for instance the discussion of the transcendental apperception [transzendentale Apperzeptionl in the First Critique (A 106-07). 24. The nature of this ex-centricity is of course the subject of Lacan's question: "Is the place that I occupy as the subject of a signifier concentric or excentric, in relation to the place I occupy as subject of the signified?" In his "The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious," in Ecrits, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York: Norton, 1977), 165.</page><page sequence="17">94 Yale French Studies the real erases it as thing and produces it as integer, but only insofar as this "disappearing" itself is both retained (as producing "meaning": the "meaning" that the object "takes" from its difference to the thing) and erased (the "identity to the concept" of the object requires that the "thing" that the object replaces appear nowhere as an unsubsumed aspect or representation of the object). The complexities and the suc- cess of Miller's position derive, again as in the Vienna Logic's defini- tion of the concept, from the ease with which the nature of the "ob- ject" shifts-the concrete object that "falls under a concept" is of a different order from the "object" "identity to a concept." This second is only first a "thing" by virtue of the effacement of the difference between "thing" and "object" in its case. For Miller's analysis to pro- ceed, "identity to a concept" has to be both "thing" and "object," both phenomenalized ("localised") and made to "fall under a concept," that is, abstracted. Abstraction and phenomenalization are here elided, principally so that the function of "taking meaning" from a difference both preserved and erased can itself be preserved. The ellipsis, accom- plished here upon the one signifier that covers two concepts, splitting the concept "object" to which the term "object" refers, instances the logic of condensation that the essay goes on to elaborate, but only after making it clear that the "concept of identity to a concept" operates in the "system" as a concept precisely not identical to itself-that is: in a formal sense, identity (to a concept) does not exist, although it does occur. The inchoate difficulties in Miller's description of the redoubling of the concept surface acutely when that redoubling is extended to the language of political agency. If suture and the unsutured in Hegemony and Socialist Strategy are not forms of determination, they neverthe- less remain linked subtly and explicitly to a notion of totality of ef- fects, to the perfection (in the verbal sense) of effects in and as the field of the social. This promise of perfection derives in great measure from an analogy between the process of conceptual embodiment and the process of symbolic or social materialization in and as social organiza- tions or institutions-the relation, say, between the will and the law. This is not, of course, just any instance. From Hegel to Althusser, the reach and implications of the analogy between conceptual embodi- ment and institutionalization will be determined by its association with an impasse dating to Rousseau: whether the concept of the collec- tive will is produced spontaneously from, or preexists, the definition of</page><page sequence="18">JACQUES LEZRA 95 a collectivity of individual wills.25 The question notoriously and symptomatically bedevils Engels, and Althusser returns to it as early as "Contradiction and Overdetermination" to make his own, and Marx's, distance from a classic understanding of the individual that Engels still embraces depend upon the possibility of learning from a Rousseaunian error. His question forcefully echoes Reading "Capital"'s concern with the "effectivity of structures on their parts": "Why is 25. This impasse, expressed with different valence but remarkably similar vocabul- aries, remains at issue in treatments of the concept of individuality, from Habermas to John Rawls. The Social Contract and its consequences are at issue from the first. The distinction between the "fiction" of the "general will" and the mode of "absence of a general content" is powerfully advanced in the Logic, precisely at the moment when Hegel considers the passage between individuality and universality. Thus the note [Zusatzl to the passage from Hegel's Logic cited above, posing that if "the logical forms of the concept were really dead and inert receptacles of conceptions and thoughts, knowl- edge about them would be an idle curiosity which the truth might dispense with," distinguishes the "real universal" from that which is merely held "in common" in these words: "The distinction .. . between what is merely in common, and what is truly universal, is strikingly expressed by Rousseau in his famous Contrat social, when he says that the laws of a state must spring from the universal will (volont6 generale), but need not on that account be the will of all (volont6 de tous). Rousseau would have made a sounder contribution towards a theory of the state if he had always kept this distinction in sight. The general will is the notion of the will; and the laws are the special clauses of this will and based upon the notion of it (Lesser Logic, 228). The concept is the form of generality itself, and Hegel would seem to need to explain for the region of phenomenol- ogy what Rousseau does for that of ethics: the relation between individuality and gener- ality. In the Zusatz, as in many of the passages in the Philosophy of Right, the weight of the argument is shifted to the relation between the notion of the will and its "special clauses," the laws. That the Zusatz should say "springs from" indicates its filiation to the sort of self-generating notion that is developed earlier in the Logic and in the Phe- nomenology. Not that the laws are in this case the means by which the concept is understood or becomes transparent: indeed, once the laws are understood to be based upon the concept they will keep it from sight. The law has to be subsumed under a concept of the general will, but also must apply to all. This being for all of the law takes the place of that which is general, and in a certain sense belongs to no one: the concept of the general will. The issue then becomes the way in which basing that which is de tous (the exercise of the law) upon what is general (the concept of the general will) preserves and records the presence or the effectivity of the notion of the will-but also eliminates it, makes it forgettable-makes one blur into the other. This hiding-forgetting of the notion by the law is the expression of a fantasy of foundation ("based upon . . . " and "springs from") that is the product of that forgetting, and which legitimates it. The state-the Rousseaunian state-can only exist on the basis of this forgetting, which amounts also, we might add, to a forgetting of the very myth told in (for instance) the "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality." The theme is constant in Hegel: "The merit of Rousseau's contribution to the search for this concept [of the Idea of the statel is that, by adducing the will as the principle of the state, he is adducing a principle which has thought both its form and its content, a principle indeed which is thinking itself, not a</page><page sequence="19">96 Yale French Studies everything so clear and harmonious at the level of individual wills, whereas beneath this level or beyond it, all becomes either empty or tautological?" (Contradiction and Overdetermination," 124). Because the very "transparency" of the problem has become the index of its ideological stakes, Althusser concludes that Engels is forced, by the obstacles it poses, into the realm of fiction, "a fiction quite as optimis- tic as the fiction of bourgeois economics, a fiction closer to Locke and Rousseau than to Marx, . . . [proposing] that the resultant of all the individual wills, and the resultant of these resultants, actually has a general content, really embodies determination in the last instance by the economic (I am thinking of Rousseau, whose dearest wish was that the particular wills, cut off from one another, might come together in a fair vote, producing that miraculous Minerva, the general will!)."26 As the ironic stress on "actual" and "real" suggests, this formulation marks a moment when Althusser is beginning to shape the contrasting thesis that ideology, that "resultant of these resultants," is their imag- inary embodiment. The lesson to be derived is indeed that the complex geometry of the social "produces" something other than a concrete content, or that the content produced is not susceptible to embodi- ment. Engels's naive, optimistic fiction instead retreats from the rigor of Marx's position to the notion that "determination in the last in- stance" by the economy is actually embodied in the "resultant" of the individual wills as their concrete content, an argument that itself cru- cially links a pedagogical notion of influence to a form of historical principle, like gregarious instinct, for instance, or divine authority, which has thought as its form only. Unfortunately . . lhe takes the will only in a determinate form as the individual will, and he regards the universal will not as the absolutely rational element in the will, but only as a 'general' will which proceeds out of this individual will as out of a conscious will. The result is that he reduces the union of individuals in the state to a contract and therefore to something based on their arbitrary wills . .. and abstract rea- soning proceeds to draw the logical inferences which destroy the absolutely divine principle of the state, together with its majesty and absolute authority."

Michael Sprinker's discussion of Althusser's confrontation with Rousseau seems to me especially fruitful: see his Imaginary Relations: Aesthetics and Ideology in the Theory of Historical Mate- rialism (London: Verso, 1987), where the decalage between individual and general will is defined by analogy to Paul de Man's notion of text.</page><page sequence="20">JACQUES LEZRA 97 embodiment or identification, opposing on one side Rousseau and En- gels (who does not learn from his teacher's errors) and on the other Marx and Althusser, who do. The error at issue, for Althusser and Marx as for Hegel (who in an important note to the Logic comments on Rousseau's incapacity to keep "before his eyes" the distinction be- tween the concept [volonte generale] and its particular special clauses [the laws that govern the volonte de tous]), has to do with the phenome- nology of embodiment: the embodying of the concept as concrete content, that is, the "production" of the concept from and within the material, cannot be the same as the "production" of the material-the concrete-from the concept. Within the language provided by the So- cial Contract, the solution to the aporias of production, bordering conceptual embodiment and institutionalization, occurs as the spon- taneous work of a miracle-that is, as a fantasy or a delusion, or as a work of literature.27 And yet the lesson to be drawn from this observation is far from clear. Althusser, who uses Rousseau here as the exemplary instance of the thinker in whom conceptual embodiment is fundamentally mythic, also suggests approvingly that Rousseau is exceptional among "18th century ideologues" in wanting his wish to be "productive"- that is, to have a material "effect." The production or birth of "mar- velous Minerva," martial wisdom fully armed springing from the fore- head of Jupiter to defend Genevan republicanism as she had once protected Athenian democracy, itself embodies, with characteristic terseness, the strategic value of the optimistic fiction as both embodi- ment or figure, and critique of embodiment. If it cannot, it seems, be construed as a material effect, the set of determinants or raepresenta- tiones communes proposed in the Social Contract should nonetheless be construed as an ideological effect, with distinct material conse- quences (the French Revolution, in one reading). The indecision marks a shift both in the understanding of Rousseau, reflected in an ambiva- lence in the description of the law and of theological language (as an ideological apparatus), and of the notions of matter, effect, and body. When Althusser takes up again the form that this "dearest wish". has for Rousseau, he does it returning to the status of the "necessary fic- 27. Althusser's definition of "spontaneity" in Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists, trans. Warren Montag (Verso: London, 1990) is useful, though it requires supplementing: "Convictions" or "beliefs" are spontaneous when they "stem from the experience of scientific practice itself in its everyday immediacy" (133).</page><page sequence="21">98 Yale French Studies tion," considering again its possible relation to material effect. In his analysis of the Social Contract, "Sur le 'Contrat Social' (les De- calages)" (1966), Althusser suggests that Rousseau builds the theoreti- cal argument about a chain of decalages, impasses each of whose solu- tion in turn generates a further, slightly more general impasse. Each of these impasses poses a genuine threat to the possibility of a generalized notion of the social: thus the decalage between the "total alienation" of the slave and the "total alienation" required to enter into a social contract is resolved as the difference but also identity between the two parties to the contract, the individual and the social body; this position then reveals a decalage between alienation and advantageous ex- change, which in turn becomes, again, the problem of the relation between the general will and the particular will, that is, the problem of the law. Rousseau both solves and displaces this last contradiction, as he does the previous ones, by means, Althusser argues, of wordplay- "upon a 'play' of words such that Rousseau calls by the same name both the specific interest of the individual taken in isolation, and the specific interest of the social group" ("Les Decalages," 35). But this "solution" obeys an important imperative: for without solving these problems, the "decalages" become confrontations, descriptions of im- passes, in such a way that the act of naming-"Rousseau calls by the same name"-returns again to the originating moment at the heart of the "Discourse on Language," an act of naming that produces what it names. The dismissal of Rousseau's fictionalizing in "Contradiction and Overdetermination" has by this point changed substantially, although the structure of the argument remains, as Michael Sprinker has shown, profoundly dialectical; and the "wish" (Althusser's as well as Rous- seau's) for the appearance of a "miraculous Minerva" of material ef- fects persists, though remarkably transformed. The movement toward a decalage and the regression from it, fuite et regression, remain posed as operating within a discontinuity between the theoretical and the real.28 It is when the last discontinuity shows itself to resist a theoreti- cal solution that Althusser opens the possibility of discussing the "fic- tional" Rousseau as an allegory of the failure of the "political" or theoretical one: 28. "'Fuite en avant dans P'ideologie, ou regression dans 1'6conomie"' is the title of the essay's last section.</page><page sequence="22">JACQUES LEZRA 99 If no possible discontinuity remains-since it would be useless in the region of theory, which has lived off of these discontinuities, chasing before it its problems in their solutions until it finds a real, insoluble problem; if no possible discontinuity remains, there is still one avenue of recourse, but of a different sort. It consists this time in a transference, the transference of the impossible theoretical solution into the other of theory: into literature. The admirable "fictitious triumph" of a writing without precedents: La Nouvelle H61oise, Emile, and the Confessions. Its being unprecedented may not be unrelated to the admirable "fail- ure" of a theory without precedents: The Social Contract.29 The movement from Rousseau's "theory" to his "fiction," the thera- peutic completing of the project, this "determining" of each by the other, stands here as a "transference" in the shape of a narrative: the narrative of a victory, a determining narrative of determination as the appearance of a recognizable "fiction." In this sense Althusser proposes a role for fiction or literature that, if it seems to be sui generis, in fact can be understood as a general program for aesthetics (as a close reading of Althusser's essay on Cremonini and "A Letter on Art" would confirm): the aesthetic is the region of a double, paradoxical embodiment. It is able to express as "fiction" the persistent troubling of cause and effect-the production-which cannot operate "in the- ory"; and it arrives at this "fiction" by means not of a conceptual, but of a "literary" movement. For this reason fiction or literature- aesthetics-is the labor of the concept, the form and direction of its "transference" from theoretical "failure" to fictional "success." But the specific means by which the "decalages" take place in this essay 29. "S'il n'est plus de Decalage possible-puisqu'il ne servirait plus a rien dans l'ordre theorique, qui n'a fait que vivre de ces Decalages, en chassant devant lui ses problkmes en leur solution jusqu'A la rencontre du problkme reel, insoluble, il reste pourtant un recours, mais d'une autre nature: un transfert, cette fois, le transfert de l'impossible solution theorique dans l'autre de la theorie, la litterature.

Compare the much more optimistic conclusion of Alain Grosrichard's essay in the same volume, "Gravite de Rousseau": "Rousseau's 'literature' is nothing but the displacement, into the interior of his writing, of a problem posed by theory. His literature is the mise en scene, the dramatization of theory .... Literature verifies theory and makes theory true; theory justifies literature and makes it necessary. This is why Rousseau's work is inseparably both literature and theory of literature, theory and literature of theory, " (64). My translation.</page><page sequence="23">100 Yale French Studies argues for another engagement as well. The terms "flight," "regres- sion," "wordplay," and finally the "transference" to the "other" of theory suggest that Althusser was seeking to articulate this "flight" in the language of psychoanalysis, the displacement from the theoretical region of the decalages to the region of fiction having the structure of a recognizable analytic movement: the externalization-projection by means of which a therapeutic fantasy can be represented, the "real embodiment" of what remains unconscious, or the dynamic of the transference. If this marked turn toward the language of psychoanalysis is not in itself surprising-"Sur le 'Contrat Social' (les Decalages)" was, after all, published in Cahiers pour l'analyse, and at a time when Althus- ser's engagement with Lacan was almost constant-some of what it suggests about Althusser's "theoretical" as well as his "biographi- cal" or literary trajectory is immediately problematic.30 In the first place, the pedagogical model of historical influence at issue in "Con- tradiction and Overdetermination" is recast here, by virtue of the seemingly open sequence of transferts, as a question of identity: the problematic identity or supplementarity, in the first instance, of the "admirable 'fictitious triumph' of a writing without precedents" with the "admirable 'failure' of a theory without precedents"; the equally problematic identity or supplementarity of the Rousseau of the Social Contract with respect to the Rousseau of La Nouvelle IHloise, Emile, and especially of the Confessions; and finally the com- plex identification, at issue already in "Contradiction and Overdeter- mination," between Althusser and the figure or figures of Rousseau. 30. I am at odds here, clearly, with David Macey, who has recently argued that the "D1calages" piece seems "out of place, if not archaic" in the project announced by Cahiers pour 1'analyse: a proposed genealogy of the social sciences. Althusser's article on "Freud and Lacan" dates from 1964-65, but see also "Trois notes sur la theorie des discours" of 1966, collected in Louis Althusser, Ecrits sur la psychanalyse, ed. Olivier Corpet and Frangois Matheron (Paris: STOCK/IMEC, 1993), 111-70, especially 143-44: "We can suggest that the ideological formations in which the formations of an uncon- scious being considered are said to 'take'-that these formations are the 'matter,' al- though the unformed matter, in which certain of the typical formations of this uncon- scious 'take.' It would be by means of these ideological formations, among others, that the unconscious could communicate according to the phenomenon that Freud de- scribes, and by means of them, too, the situation of transference would occur. This point deserves careful attention, especially as concerns definition and conceptual refinement; for one cannot simply accept the category of 'matter.' It has the grave disadvantage of masking the very important fact that the discourse of the unconscious is produced in and by means of ideological discourse, the fragment of ideological discourse where the un- conscious discourse 'takes,' while being absent from that discourse." My translation.</page><page sequence="24">JACQUES LEZRA 101 For we cannot be blind to the pathos of the essay's concluding lines. The topos of the flight from reason-theoria-to "an avenue of re- course, but of a different sort" is not only the narrative of the birth and the therapeutic necessity of fiction or of literature, or the narrative of the failure of all merely theoreticist positions whose effectivity must be completed or supplemented by a passage or transference into the material region of theoretical practice (Marx: "Philosophers have in- terpreted the world; the point, however, is to change it"). It is also, as its roots in Romanticism serve to remind us, the narrative of a flight into madness. The flight or regression into fiction described for Rousseau- the flight from theoretical impasses-will be read also as the funda- mental moment of this identification between Althusser and Rous- seau: the recourse of madness that derives "theoretically" from the effort to overcome decalages internal to the genealogy of the concept, and "biographically" from the conditions described in the autobiogra- phies, and condensed there, with the rigor of denegation, in the open- ing pages: "Alas," Althusser writes in The Future Lasts Forever, "I am no Rousseau. But in planning to write about myself and the dramatic events I lived through and live with still, I often thought about his unprecedented boldness. Not that I would ever claim as he did at the beginning of the Confessions: 'I am embarking on something which has never been done before.' Certainly not. But I can in all honesty subscribe to the following declaration of his: 'I shall say openly what I did, what I thought, what I was."'31 But in the second place, and to a great extent in contrast, the dy- namic of transference, for all its descriptive power and suggestiveness for the question of identity, poses fundamental problems as well. Transfert in "Sur le 'Contrat Social' (les Decalages)" conveniently straddles the field of intentional acts as well as nonintentional events, for important theoretical reasons: the movement toward resolving the last, most stubborn decalage in Rousseau is not Rousseau's own, "proper" act or decision, nor does it obey a structural necessity that might immediately have "produced" the literary "recourse" from the 31. Althusser, The Future Lasts Forever and the Facts, ed. Olivier Corpet and Yann Moulier Boutang, trans. Richard Veasey (London: Chatto and Windus, 1993). Laclau and Mouffe's description of the argumentation on the problem of determination in Althusser bears repeating, as a description of a pathology: "From the very beginning, an attempt was made to render it compatible with another central moment in Althusserian dis- course that is, strictly speaking, incompatible with the first." This transference of the language of "theory" to that of "biography" is most explicit in Peter Sloterdijk's com- ments on Althusser in Critique of Cynical Reason.</page><page sequence="25">102 Yale French Studies failure of the theoretical. Instead, and as the strikingly depersonalized grammar of the last sentences conveys as well, the transfert from "fail- ure" to "victory," the therapeutic supplementation of theory by fic- tion obeys the impersonal difficulty of distinguishing, on any grounds, between an intentional act and an event. It should be remarked that the same is generally true for descriptions of analytic transference: it oc- curs, it happens that the analyst or another figure acquires for the patient the characteristics of a figure from the pantheon of the analy- sand's recollections-and the intentional form of that transference is what remains to be produced in and by means of the analysis.32 The consequences of this depersonalization for the phenomenology of em- bodiment are again mixed. If we seek in the engagement with Rousseau the transference (back) to the realm of "theory" (miraculous Minerva, philosophical, literary, and political) of concepts from psychoanalysis and from literature, then we need to account also for the contingent movement that the language of psychoanalysis consistently associates with every such narrative. Thus although Rousseau's strategy in mov- ing from decalage to theoretical solution is one of condensation-two or more concepts or senses of a word condensed in one signifier-there is no reason to suppose that the closing "transference" from failure to victory, from the arena of theory to that of fiction, follows the same pattern. The "recourse" to the other in this instance is made to seem necessary, to take the form of a narrative reaching a foreseeable and determined closure-but the association of Althusser with Rousseau here is indeed as contingent as the object of transference in the analytic situation can be. To put it differently: the transfert from theory to literature or to madness can be described as therapeutic, as producing identification or personification when not identity, only from the per- 32. See Mladen Dolar's quite different treatment of Althusser and transference as the more restricted transference-love in "Beyond Interpellation," Qui Parle 6/2 (1993), 84-5: "This love of the patient for the analyst ... springs up with an astonishing, almost mechanical regularity in the analytical situation, regardless of the person of the analyst and that of the patient.... The minimal mechanism of transference is embed- ded in the very basic function of speech as addressed to the Other, the Other as an instance beyond all empirical interlocutors." Dolar is careful to note that the "dialectics of transference" requires another moment or aspect: "the emergence of transference- love as . . . a halt of repetition, when the free flow is cut short, when words fail; it emerges as a resistance, or, as Lacan puts it, as the closing of the unconscious." From this "dialectic," Dolar suggestively concludes, the remainder-love-emerges to provide a way of understanding the possibility of subjectivity "beyond interpellation, " though the more extensive sense of transference I am suggesting here considerably changes the nature and ethical dimension of that "emergence."</page><page sequence="26">JACQUES LEZRA 103 spective that it has abandoned: the perspective of theory. From the perspective of literature or of psychoanalysis, and a fortiori from the perspective (if one can still call it that) of madness, the dynamic of transfert is always an "avenue ... of a different sort" from the terms that theory can use to describe it, or transfer onto it. Again, from the perspective of literature or of psychoanalysis, indeed from the perspec- tive (for instance) of the Confessions, the "transference" (of guilt or of responsibility, say) does not occur (necessarily) from theory to its other or from one person to another, but to what is at hand, a metonymic "flight" to an other whose connection to theory this flight then pro- duces.33 "Transference" no longer straddles-that is, participates in and joins-two distinct arenas; it is not a trope for the free movement [phorein] of the word from one to another, from theory to fiction or from Rousseau to Althusser; it is not a jeu de mots condensing two concepts under a single term so as to retain and limn for and in us the synthetic consciousness of the concept of identity to a concept. Let us call it instead a rule, though of a paradoxical sort: the form of a gerund, transference as transfering cannot, to return to Kant's initial formulation, "serve as a rule" [zur Regel dient] that would predict the direction (from theory to fiction, or to practice, or to matter) of any concrete content or instance, including particular rules. As a rule, "transference" happens, it is an event; but because of the rule of its occurring, "transference" has in itself no regulative content. The issue immediately becomes considerably broader than the local question of the status granted "literature" in the failure of the Social Contract. It is by now understood that it is not possible to settle on either of the two models of causation that Althusser deploys in "Sur le 'Contrat Social' (les Decalages) " and in Reading "Capital, " a "metonymic causality" on the one hand, and on the other the hypothesis of a structuring, "discon- certing but inevitable absence, the absence of the concept" in the mode of a deus absconditus in Pascal's tradition. Doubtless, this unde- cidability constitutes the closest point of contact between the project 33. This is of course the point best made by Paul de Man about the Confessions, in "Excuses (Confessions)," his chapter on the Marion episode in Allegories of Reading (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), 278-301, esp. 288-9: "Because Rousseau desires Marion, she haunts his mind and her name is pronounced almost unconsciously, as if it were a slip, a segment of the discourse of the other.... But Marion just happened to be the first thing that came to mind; any other name, any other word, any other sound or noise could have done just as well and Marion's entry into the discourse is a mere effect of chance. She is a free signifier, metonymically related to the part she is made to play in the subsequent system of exchanges and substitutions."</page><page sequence="27">104 Yale French Studies of Reading "Capital" and the unsutured field of the social envisioned by proponents of "radical democracy," from Laclau to Judith Butler. One can, indeed, express this undecidability as the interference of two models, one transcendental and the other materialist, the first ac- counting for intentional acts and the second for nonintentional events, whose complex history includes the encounters and failed synthesis, within and between the foundational texts of Marxism, of a theology and a materialism, of an apocalyptic rhetoric and an empirical one, the rhetoric of the Communist Manifesto and of Lenin's Materialism and Empirio-criticism. But most importantly: the rule of "transference" records this undecidability as a fundamental break that cannot be su- tured, forgotten, or sublated by a transference into the arena of fiction or of practice. For it is not just that the "concept of identity to a concept" operates in the "system" as a concept precisely not identical to itself, but that, to the extent that it is a product, in a formal sense, such a concept does not exist, although it does occur. What happens, what is an event, as the irreducible difference between what is de tous and what is general, as the form of justice, happens "upon a play of words," and is inescapably literary. To approach Althusser's understanding of this therapeutic literary model requires passing from what I have been posing as a formal dis- cussion of the incompleting or unfinishing of reflection in the occur- ring of a certain transfert, to the concrete content furnished by this reflection. I have, in fact, been making this transition throughout-or rather, it has been occurring throughout, for reasons that are inextrica- bly both historical and theoretical. Marx's own engagement with Hegel, for instance, is determined by the necessity of passing from the formal to the material, and from the form to the content of proposi- tions-a necessity that Marx is careful to address both theoretically and allegorically. In the Critique of Hegel's "Philosophy of Right," to take the best-known example, Marx expresses his understanding of Hegel's description of the passage from the "logical forms of the con- cept" to "the vital spirit [lebendige Geist] of the actual world" as a symmetrical confusion: although Hegel believes that in the Philoso- phy of Right he is able to derive and develop the determinate-the concrete-reality of the organism of the state from its idea, Hegel in fact derives the concrete from the presupposed concept: "He does not develop his thought out of what is objective [aus dem Gegenstand], but what is objective in accordance with a ready-made thought which has its origin in the abstract sphere of logic." Hegel, it seems, makes the</page><page sequence="28">JACQUES LEZRA 105 necessity of the movement toward the concrete universal derive from this "abstract sphere, " and as such the necessity is not itself "critically demonstrated" as internal to the various powers proper to the organic state. This process of deriving the necessity of an internal movement from an "alien" principle Marx then describes in these terms: Just as their necessity is not derived from their own nature, still less is it critically demonstrated. On the contrary, their realization is predes- tined by the nature of the concept, sealed in the holy register of the Santa Casa (the Logic). The soul of objects, in this case that of the state, is complete and predestined before its body, which is, properly speak- ing, mere appearance. The concept is the "Son" within the "Idea," within God the Father, the agens, the determining, differentiating principle.34 The unsystematic theology of the passage works in a number of differ- ent ways around the same knot, rendering allegorically the circularity that the Critique points out analytically: if the concept is not to be like the soul or the idea, subsisting and eternal, transcendent if not Pla- tonic, but is instead a derived or produced representation, then its origin, its appearing, must be external to it: a matter of labor. And if necessity is not to be equally transcendent ("predestined by the nature of the concept") then the realization of the objective and of the form of logic also require deriving, if only in the form of a narrative or myth of origin. Here Marx makes use of the traditional problem in Platonic Christianity: when the preexisting or the ontological priority of the soul vis a vis the body is translated into the structure of the Trinity, God-the-Father becomes the agens of whom the Son is either the soul or the mere appearance. What is a resolute ontological as well as tem- poral hierarchy in the case of the soul and the body clashes with the theological need for mutual immanence in the case of the theology of the Trinity. To be sure, the niceties of dogma are not Marx's main object, just as they are not in Althusser's well-known uses of theology in "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses": the Critique of Hegel's "Philoso- 34. Marx, Critique of Hegel's "Philosophy of Right, " trans. Joseph O'Malley (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 15. Marx is here poking fun especially at the Zusatz to the Logic, paragraph 161: "The movement of the notion is as it were to be looked upon merely as play: the other which it sets up is in reality not an other. Or, as it is expressed in the teaching of Christianity: not merely has God created a world which confronts him as an other; he has also from all eternity begotten a Son in whom he, a Spirit, is at home with himself " (225).</page><page sequence="29">106 Yale French Studies phy of Right" is concerned instead with the possible solutions to the circular phenomenology of "derivation" gingerly advanced in the Phi- losophy of Right, the transcendental model of annunciation and pre- destination (the concrete universal would appear according to a "ne- cessity ... derived from the nature" of what is objective) and a dialectical one (the concrete universal would be produced from the difference between the objective and its first formalization in the Logic as a concept). The sealing of the concept in the Logic or Santa Casa is an effort by Marx to show, at the level of the image, how Hegel is condens- ing these incompatibilities, and it is worth dwelling for a moment on this parodic materialization of the argument of the Logic. Transported miraculously to Loreto in the thirteenth century, the Santa Casa, the setting of the Annunciation to Mary, is already by the time of the Renaissance a thick cultural icon that condenses a number of tropes both literary and theological: the transference of the house corre- sponds to a translatio imperii from Nazareth to Italy and hence to the Holy Roman Empire; site of miraculous cures, by the sixteenth cen- tury it had acquired around it a second "casa, " the Sanctuary in which it was sealed and shielded, and in which it became by the early seven- teenth century an emblem of a "holy register" defined architecturally also by the traces of those cures, a scaffold of crutches, canes, and objects cast off by pilgrims whom a vision of the Santa Casa had made whole.35 An armature of discarded tokens, phantoms of bodies that have been cured in turn concealing, clothing, or embodying a house sealed within a sanctuary-the abyssal presentation of the absent cause by its successive, hollow embodiments could hardly be more compactly rendered, the parentheses in Marx's text ("their realization is predestined by the nature of the concept, sealed in the holy register of the Santa Casa [the Logic]") materializing at the level of the sentence the logic of metonymous substitution of inside for out, container for contained, form for content or for matter, on which the Philosophy of 35. Cervantes's characteristically ironic description of the Santa Casa is perhaps the best known: Tomds Rodaja, who will become the mad Master Glass, visits "Our Lady of Loreto, in whose holy temple he saw neither walls nor battlements, for they were cov- ered entirely with crutches, shrouds, chains, cuffs, metal bands, hair pieces, half-weights of wax, paintings and tableaux, which made manifest the innumerable gifts that many had received from the hand of God through the intercession of his divine Mother, who enriched and legitimated that holy image with a flock of miracles, as a reward for the veneration in which it is held by those who decorate the walls of her house with such gifts." From "El licenciado Vidriera," in Miguel de Cervantes, Novelas ejemplares (Madrid; Castalia, 1986), vol. 2, 112-3. Translation mine.</page><page sequence="30">JACQUES LEZRA 107 Right seems to rest. The Santa Casa, standing for the body of Mary in whom the concept and the word (the Son) are materialized, "seals" for Marx the form of the Logic, body, outer shell, or architecture to the concept which it produces and which it serves, as Mary serves to con- tain and bear the concept, ancilla Dei. Whatever humor attends the form of this encounter between Marx and Hegel concerning the origin of the concept should not conceal what is at stake "sealed within" its register: the determining fantasy of philosophical language-the production of "new" concepts-is the narrative of a miraculous birth, to which Marx will seek to restore the elementary resistance of the object and the suffering of its production, which is to say the element of material labor. Miraculous, because it is both spontaneous (that is: unannounced) and determined, both the labor of the objective that bears the concept and the labor of reflection upon the object. Miraculous, finally, because the doctrine of the con- cept expresses as early as Kant both the fantasy of immaterial concep- tion, the mother merely bearing (tragt] what is immediate to the agens, the father; and, indissociably and consequently, the fantasy of the maternal father, bearing like Jupiter the body of philosophy and armed wisdom, miraculous Minerva midwifed by Vulcan. To speak in slightly less allegorical terms: the story of the production of the object of knowledge from the object or vice-versa is always embodied as a fantasy of the spontaneous reproduction of the identity to itself of the concept from which the new concept is produced-even though the "new"/ concept is the mark of the nonidentity to itself of the concept in general, and even though if the concept is going to be common, like the law, its parentage and birth need to be established or derived according to the law. "Thought" does not "derive from the objective" [aus dem Gegenstand], even when the objective is itself already symbolic, as its therapeutic cure or completing, "fiction" to its "theory" or "theory" to its "fiction," but as its vestige, its discarded crutch, so to speak: assembled about the hidden "register" of a translated or transferred container [Trager], phantom of the wounded or broken body as well as of the whole one reborn miraculously, spontaneously. This improper condensation of the complete and the incomplete, identity to self and nonidentity to self, is a formative aspect of the doctrine of the concept. Concepts "come from" a labor that effaces/produces its property over what it conceives, a labor that labors to efface itself as such, as the production of the concept as the nonidentical to itself. Miraculous Minerva, indeed: just as Marx both overturns Hegel (requiring that he</page><page sequence="31">108 Yale French Studies "develop his thought out of what is objective") and changes his terms, Althusser reads Rousseau as expressing the leaving out of a determi- nant-the labor of the coming-together of the general will, that is to say, the labor of the production of consciousness, the material condi- tions of the construction of consciousness. If we now must understand that the riven "production of the con- cept" of effectivity is for us the site of a strong interference between two concepts, the "life" and the "work," then we must expect to find that in "Althusser" any reflection upon the production of the concept has to occur as both theory and biography.36 We have seen in outline the stakes of this occurring in the notion of a "metonymic causality" in Reading "Capital. " It should be no surprise that in the "life"-that is, in the autobiographies-we discover a reflection upon the produc- tion of the concept, embedded within a reflection upon the possibility of passing from exceptional experience to a rule about that experience. It is a story told as a joke or a jibe, which, having to do with the origin of what was to become Reading "Capital," allows me to return to the ideological project with which I opened. Like so many jokes, which for reasons that must remain enigmatic concern the propriety of the act of naming, Althusser's strange tale has to do with theft and with desire- though nominally it concerns the seminar on Capital: [Jacques-Alain] Miller was the [member of the seminar] with the most fixed ideas on the subject, but he dropped out completely in the course of the year. He was living in a hunting-lodge at Rambouillet with a girl who "produced," so he said, "at least one theoretical concept a week." ... After [Ranciere's] intervention everything was easy because he opened up the debate effectively and in areas to which we were already giving some thought; this was after a talk of mine on Lacan during which [Jacques-Alain] Miller intervened to announce a "conceptual discovery": "metonymic causality" (otherwise known as the absent cause), which caused quite a stir .... When Miller returned ... and read the duplicated pages of the papers people had given, he discovered Ranciere had "stolen" his own concept of "metonymic causality" [son concept personnel]. Ranciere suffered terribly when charged with this. And is it not the case that concepts belong to everyone? ... My reason 36. The biographical sense of this is not unimportant: Reading "Capital, " like For Marx, breaks from the "humanist" reading of Marx that privileges the early, more Hegelian work. Vigorous defenses of a more "humanistic" reading of both Marx and Hegel abounded, of course. Lucien Goldmann is perhaps the best known, but see also Jacques d'Hondt, De Hegel a Marx (Paris: PUF, 1972), especially 219-28.</page><page sequence="32">JACQUES LEZRA 109 for relating this ridiculous incident is not to put Miller down. After all, youth must have its fling. Furthermore, it seems he began his magis- terial course on Lacan this year by solemnly declaring, "We are not studying Lacan but being studied by him. " This proves he too was capable of acknowledging someone else had invented and owned a con- cept. . . . None the less, this absurd idea of the "theft of concepts" touched on a point of principle which concerned me deeply and caused me great anxiety: the question of anonymity. [The Future Lasts For- ever, 208-10] The moment is recounted differently in two earlier passages in The Facts: "Some students at the Ecole [Normale Superieure] had been quite impressed by [Lacan], among them Jacques-Alain Miller, whose famous concept had been plagiarised and who was wooing Judith Lacan" (a qui on avait vole le fameux concept de sa vie, a suggestive phrasing that joins the "concept of a life"-its correlative on the level of concepts-to the "concept of a lifetime," the best or most important one). And: We [Balibar, Macherey, Establet, and Rancierej organized a seminar on Das Kapital during the academic year 1964-5. Ranciere set it going and got us over our initial difficulties, for which he deserves our thanks, as no one else was prepared to start the ball rolling.... It was a masterly exposition. . . slightly formalist and Lacanian (the "absent cause" kept coming up) but it showed real ability.... Jacques-Alain Miller, who was already going out with Judith Lacan, displayed great initiative in October 1964, which brought him to prominence, and then disap- peared completely (he had gone off with a girl to the forest of Fon- tainebleau and was teaching her how to produce theoretical concepts). He reappeared again without warning in June 1965 to reveal, much to everyone's astonishment, that someone had "stolen one of his con- cepts." .... In actual fact, [the incident] was quite exceptional. Con- cepts circulate freely as they are being developed without any controls placed on them. [The Facts, 333] Why would this anecdote matter enough to Althusser to be repeated? If one sets aside momentarily the rather sophomoric tone in which the scene is told and retold, a different configuration emerges, signaled by Althusser's repeated effort to move from the arena of the biographical to the theoretical, the incident becoming "exceptional" when consid- ered against the analytic description of the concept in general: "And is it not the case that concepts belong to everyone?" and: "Concepts</page><page sequence="33">110 Yale French Studies circulate freely as they are being developed without any controls placed on them." The "property" of the concept of metonymic causality that Miller had proposed is the immediate precursor, it needs to be recalled, to the development or production of the concepts of "structural causal- ity" and of "suture" upon which Laclau and Mouffe rest their project. One quick answer to the question of the scene's recurrence is indeed that it touches upon what Althusser perceives to be most his own, "a point of principle which concerned me deeply and caused me great anxiety," what most clearly affects the representation of himself and his relation to his work and to the concepts he "produced." It touches upon this "point of principle" both as a problem of names and ano- nymity, and in the form of a question: what about concepts-and not just any concept: metonymic causality is the notion that will make it possible to discuss the "effectivity of a structure upon its elements," or to apply the notion of overdetermination in the first place-can be said to be personnel, and what can be said to be de tous? What about con- cepts can be "discovered," moveable, nonproper, what about them cannot be stolen? What, in a word, is immaterial about the concept? The answer, covertly offered, is that what is immaterial about the concept (that is: ideally and indivisibly an aspect of it regardless of the concrete content of its occurring) is its freedom to circulate, or, more precisely, its spontaneous circulating, its occurring as spontaneous circulating. Is it enough to observe, then, that the project of Reading " Capital," the production of the concept of the "effectivity of a structure on its elements," and the complex passage from reflection to the rule of its incompleteness need to be reread in the light of this strange "theft" to which the concept seems susceptible? For surely the notion of the pre- positional immateriality of the concept is at odds with the notion of the production of the concept, of the notion of the spontaneous labor to which works like Reading "Capital " and "Sur le 'Contrat Social' (les Decalages)," I have been arguing, are devoted. The proposition that an ideal "freedom" of circulation underlies the concept's various material embodiments (as raepresentationes) need only be recast in the lan- guage of "rights" to square with formulations we might expect in the doctrines of classical humanism (the doctrines of "inalienable rights," for instance). On reflection, however, it cannot be simply coincidental that Althusser's idealization of the concept occurs at the very moment in which a sense "not identical to this one" is being proposed for and within the story that his autobiography tells: the "proper" conceptual</page><page sequence="34">JACQUES LEZRA 1ll content of "this ridiculous incident" is a didactic allegory posing that the ideality of the concept as such precludes its becoming the property of any one. Neither can it be coincidental that Althusser fancifully engages here the two familiar tropes for the spontaneous production of the concept-the "miraculous Minerva" or birth of the concept from a man, and the ancilla Dei, Mary as the handservant [Dienerin] of the Holy Spirit, the carrier of the concept. The tone and nature of Althus- ser's remarks in the autobiographies should give us an indication that something else is sealed in this register with the problem of the self-identity of the concept, something or some process constantly exceeding the ideal borders of a subjective sense of freedom. Remark, first, that the enviously infantilizing quality of these passages remains constant: the "wooing of Judith Lacan" is imagined contiguously with a libidino-political "teaching" in the forests of Fontainebleau, the "production of theoretical concepts" encoded here as an eroticized act, a form of intercourse or pedagogy in which Miller, the "owner" of the "concept of his life," becomes a disappearing and reappearing princi- ple; even the scene's locations acquire, in this context, a pseudorusti- cal genealogy linking them to literary topoi of pastoral retreat and contemplation on one hand (Fontainebleau), and to sexual strategy, chase, and violence on the other ("a hunting-lodge at Rambouillet"). Other micronarratives concerning identity and anonymity soon emerge from behind questions, sometimes with the crass insistence one expects of soap-opera plots, sometimes with the open subtlety of the roman policier: Who "produced" the concept whose "discovery" was announced-Miller or the "girl" who "produced at least one theo- retical concept a week"? Are Judith Lacan and "a girl" or "the girl" the same? If "teaching" how to produce theoretical concepts is a libidinal or erotic act (but whose?), what would it then mean to "study" or be "studied" by another? What role does the name "Lacan" play in Al- thusser's description? What other names are screened here? The point of this explication and of these questions is neither to catch Althusser in contradictions that may express nothing more than the license of rhetorical ornament or the momentum of a joke, nor to provide these contradictions with a psychobiographical intent or mo- tivation. The passages I have cited from the autobiographies give rise to three separate observations that bear upon the occurring of "rhetorical ornament," undecidable and overdetermined "micronarratives," and "jokes"-that bear, that is, on the dynamic of transfert or of what Laclau and Mouffe call "deconstructive effects" at work where "life"</page><page sequence="35">112 Yale French Studies and "concept" seem to meet. In the first place, and concerning what I can still call the form of the argument: where the "production of con- cepts" is being established as a concept and as a concrete, even hu- morous raepresentatio, and where the formal ideality of concepts in general is being located in the freedom of their circulation, Althusser's "life" produces literary effects that are not concepts, that are not iden- tical to themselves, and which circulate "freely" by putting into ques- tion the possibility of distinguishing between what "everyone" owns and is responsible for and what "someone else" has invented and owned. Freely circulating though these literary effects may be, what is not free about them-that is, what cannot be separated from these effects-is their occurring as events: reading-events, to be sure, but also, in the form of their insistent return in the autobiographies, writing-events. The practical consequences to be derived from the questioning they make necessary and from the rule of their occurrence are nowhere more poignantly, and threateningly, felt than where what "everyone owns" and what "someone else" has invented is the set of raepresentationes communes that we call our life, Althusser's life or autobiographies, or another's, "le concept de sa vie." These scenes from the autobiographies tell allegorically the story of the "produc- tion" of Althusser's "life" and of the concept of life as what cannot properly belong either to an "owner" or to a community. One under- stands why the story never stops being told. If these literary effects occur spontaneously, however, then they cannot have the status of a rule-or, rather, one can again argue, as with Althusser's reading of the Social Contract, that as a rule they occur, but that no rule formalizing the occurring of literary effects or their production can be produced. If this is so, then the occurring of this allegory of desire and of excessive transfert at the moment when the concept of metonymic causality is discussed and thematized in the "life" could not, in principle or as a rule, have been foreseen or re- peated. The coincidence of the thematics of "birth," "concept," "theft," and "desire" with the spontaneous overdetermination of liter- ary effect would itself, in this case, become an instance of metonymic causality, a true event which would always only have been, its present as an occurrence always an absence "to be measured" or reconstituted after the fact. That it is, quite to the contrary, a foreseeable and indeed repeatable occurrence-for Althusser, the story is told three times, with differences that make no difference-suggests to what extent this formal rule has to be understood as also parasitized, contaminated by</page><page sequence="36">JACQUES LEZRA 113 or embodied already in the discursive and material rules of "life" or of "biography." It is for this reason that "the totality of ... deconstruc- tive effects" of the notion of determination may never be accessible: there is no "totality" of deconstructive effects, because the effort to establish the rule for the occurring of transference or of literary effect is itself a practical, not a transcendental one. (It is not accidental that one can express this impasse upon a play of words about the word "as": "As a rule, it occurs; it does not occur as a rule"). Efforts in Laclau and Mouffe, in Zizek, in Sloterdijk, and in others (including Althusser himself) to measure Althusser by means of the concept of develop- ment toward determination in the last instance repeat therapeutically the narrative transference from "theory" to "fiction" or to madness that characterizes the form of the concept's production. And to put it differently: to the extent that they are readings of Althusser as well as repetitions of his work, narratives that determine the effect of his work or life are indeed "deconstructive effects" showing that the hetero- geneity of their own text concerns its necessary reliance (for example) on the structure of the confessional narrative, the narrative of excuses. The effects of this unfinishing are themselves always unfinished be- cause the story or the allegory of the becoming-concept of life, and the becoming-life of the concept, that is, the story of "theory" and the story of "fiction," are never identical to each other or to themselves. Matters are not finished yet, however. For in the second place, and as to the concrete content or embodiment of this story: the transference from theory to fiction, its status as an event and as a rule of occurring, serve to account for the political movement from volonte de tous to volonte generale, and to account for the comparable epistemological movement from the law to the concept (in order to understand the volonte generale, one needs to eliminate and elevate the particular laws which are its manifestation) in terms of a procedure that can no longer be conceptualized. At this point the difficulties of the transfert are no longer matters of singular identity. For the narratives distin- guishing one from the other, "theory" from "fiction" or volonte de tous from volonte generale accord a temporal priority to the epis- temological effort that becomes "embodied" after the fact, an annunci- ation that fixes the word in flesh-and these narratives are themselves the product and the record of that "embodiment," as their organic concept. The embodying of the concept that must follow its philosoph- ical production does so only to the extent that an organic figure for temporal relation-for "following"-is presupposed. In Althusser as</page><page sequence="37">114 Yale French Studies in Marx, this circular figure or figure for circularity is again classically double: the concept of the law, sealed within the representation of the (hidden or appropriated) body of the woman that gives birth (that "pro- duces theoretical concepts") to what in turn conceives and bears her as agens. Two programs of thought concerning this organic concept follow. One, which can be associated with the early work of Luce Irigaray, contrasts the specularity of the (history of the) concept to the noniden- tity to itself of the woman or of women, a sex always not-one. This process of association serves as a representation for what is unpresent- able: the philosphemes of "transcendental" and "empirical," or "con- ceptual" and "material," embody their nonidentity to themselves in a body-a raepresentatio communis-culturally available to them as both single and double, single to itself and double as it is maternal or labile, self-identical and always not-one. The woman "serves" the con- cept that she bears as mother or as labile body, serves it by becoming useful, as representing the not-one of its "birth," pedagogically: she teaches the concept "how to produce theoretical concepts" and how to forget (as one forgets the "mere" representation) the labor of that pro- duction. And two: to the contrary, the woman ideally absent from the Santa Casa as from the history of the doctrine of the concept is herself a concept "produced" from the forehead of the agens as a hypostasis of the material, another concept or another goddess-Materia, as miracu- lous in her way as Minerva. Her body is not already available to repre- sent for philosophy the circularity of its origin as a concept or system of concepts, but is produced and fashioned so as to take that pedagogical function (of carrier, of servant, etc.). In this formulation, sealed as alternative directions within the languages of philosophical feminism, both projects are unmistakably idealizing. It would be a glaring error, for instance, to claim that their philosophical and cultural role as the therapeutic Materia is the guiding reason for the fashioning of women's bodies as not-one. It would also be a mistake to assert that this therapeutic role preexists in any simple way the philosophical need or impasse-decalage-that it unmistakably serves to resolve. The conditions of fashioning and production as well as the measure- ment of their motives are both over- and underdetermined: their econ- omy, the patient and violent labor of the discourses and pressures of culture, the spontaneous resistance of matter are themselves as objects of thought the product they seem to fashion. This does not mean that we abandon the concrete content of the</page><page sequence="38">JACQUES LEZRA 115 body, that because the always divided body of Materia does not neces- sarily seal within it, does not necessarily bear (the form of) the mate- rial body of a woman, we abandon the rigor of this circularity. For in the third place, and finally, if the nature of the occurring of the concept unfinishes the possibility of reflecting upon Marxism as a system of concepts, it also becomes the condition for a practice whose task- whose necessity-it is to account for the coincidence of the thematic ("birth," in this case, "desire," "concept," "suffering," and so on) with the theoretical in "literature" about "life," or to account in "theory" as in "fiction" for the force with which the concept's embodiment seals culturally the mother's body within Materia's form and vice-versa. I do not-it must be clear-mean by this that Althusser, Balibar, Ma- cherey, and their closest readers make this necessity a general law, but rather that they pose it as a rule of reflection and of action, a practical, rather than a transcendental, rule; as a reflection that does not exist formally, but that does occur. We can, for instance, reflect that "fic- tion" constantly incompletes or undetermines the theory from which it is born, and that "theory" does the same to the fiction that bears it. But when we seek to know what form this reflection could have, and why and how it imposes itself, we find ourselves, whether we like it or not, in the unstable region of Witz, of practical gaming, of linguistic materiality. This "region" should not be unrecognizable: for this ne- cessity of the occurring of reflection also takes historically the form of a movement toward and within psychoanalytic language (and prac- tice), which poses as a literary matter that its object of inquiry is not (only) a concept, but the becoming-concept of its incompleteness as a field riven by the occurring of transference.37 It is here, precisely at the opposite point from where Laclau and Mouffe introduce the notion of suture in their argument, that the seduction of psychoanalysis in the form of a meditation on transfert arises in Althusser. The language of psychoanalysis, and in particular its notoriously divided relation to the figure of the woman, then provides a way to return to the question of the "effectivity" of a structure upon its elements; to argue that any reflection upon agency has to be understood outside of the horizon of the ultimate arrival of the concept, that is, outside of the apocalyptic 37. On the relation between Althusser's Marxism and psychoanalysis, see espe- cially Warren Montag's "Marxism and Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Encounter," Minnesota review N.S. 23 (Fall 1984): 70-85. I understand Montag's stress on the com- plex, analogous materiality of ideology and of the unconscious as complementing my suggestion about the role of transference in incompleting both sides of the "encounter."</page><page sequence="39">116 Yale French Studies horizon of a dialectic; to pose that the concept, like a symptom, is always born, always arrives, both too late and too soon. The witticisms, hesitations, and imponderables at issue in the au- tobiographies as in the work on Rousseau may then reflect an anxiety about the concept in its psychoanalytic usage, and about the seduc- tiveness and violence of psychoanalytic language more broadly (both as it might draw Miller, the student "with the most fixed ideas on the subject, " away from Althusser and towards Lacan or Lacan's daughter, and as it might serve to seduce or chase, hunt, do violence to Althusser himself). Jacques-Alain Miller's work was indeed construed, as Eliz- abeth Roudinesco shows, as designating the juncture between Al- thusser and Lacan, a place institutionalized and polemically named by and in the very Cahiers pour l'analyse in which the "Suture" essay would appear.38 The line associating these moments to the transfert in the essay on Rousseau, and to the overdetermined appearance of psy- choanalytic vocabulary there, is clear: what Miller "has," desires, or has produced should "belong to everyone"-the concept of met- onymic causality, the "girl" who produces theoretical concepts week- ly, and finally Judith Lacan and through her and in her name the lan- guage and the concepts of her father. The process of "embodying" concepts serves here to make them figuratively "proper" to a body (Judith Lacan and Miller, or Althusser, whose "talk on Lacan" was the occasion for Miller to announce his "discovery") just where this sense of property is most aggressively in question. The argumentative im- passe is posed baldly: "And is it not the case that concepts belong to everyone?" the passage from The Future Lasts Forever rhetorically asks-answering both that "[Miller] too was capable of acknowledging someone else had invented and owned a concept," and that such a notion of property is "absurd." The condition this impasse sketches is to a great extent our own as well, since it is now hard to tell in principle whether the language of psychoanalysis historically arises, like the miraculous figures of Mi- nerva and of Materia, to complete a philosophical language that it also unfinishes, an effect of the doctrine of the concept and inseparable from it; or if it is culturally available to that end, independently and contingently. Like the system of concepts that we call Marxism, the 38. Serge Leclaire indeed shows that Miller's work is associated with a notion of an "unconscious concept" deriving from Freud, and concerning the nonidentical to itself.

Here we must again depersonalize these reflections: for no "concept personnel" or "concept de sa vie" attaches to "someone" or "something else," as no allegorical form can hope to embody or represent it, him, or her. And yet Marxism today and in its futures remains the study of the legit- imacy and conditions of possibility (material, conceptual) of such property in general, as well as the condition of possibility of its con- stant redistribution across the competing discursive fields of the so- cial. As such, Marxism survives where the substituting of allegory for concept fails, where (on a different level) the circulation between con- cept and object is blocked: between "concept" and "personne" and between bodies and their concepts, as it were, where the nonidentity to itself of each fails to complete itself in the other, miraculous Materia. It survives as the reiteration of a transfert whose therapeutic "effects" can never become concepts, that is, as literature, as the language of psychoanalysis, or, more precisely, as the endless, disruptive birth or occurring of "deconstructive effects" where the concept of life and the concept of person seek to take meaning. The occurring of reflection is the name we give to Marxism's spontaneous labors: for if literature and psychoanalysis are born from the incompleting of its philosophy, it is no less true that the concept of a philosophy for Marxism is born at the same moment from the incompleting-the deconstruction-of litera- ture and of psychoanalysis.</page></plain_text>
