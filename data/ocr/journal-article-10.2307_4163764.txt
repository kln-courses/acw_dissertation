<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORIOLES, BLACKBIRDS, AND THEIR KIN: A NATURAL HISTORY. By Alexander F Skutch. Illus. by Dana Gardner. The University of Arizona Press, Tucson, Arizona. 1996:291 pp. $50.00 (cloth), $21.95 (paper).-Who says there are no more heroes to emulate? Mine easily could be Alexander F Skutch. At time when study of whole organisms is considered passe by some, Dr. Skutch has produced a masterful account of the natural history of a very important group-the blackbirds (and after his 90th birthday!). This book, his twenty-sixth, guides us to through a detailed, but never boring, account of how the orioles, blackbirds, and their kin go through their lives. Some accounts were taken, "with slight modifications" from Skutch's Life histories of Central American birds, published in 1954 by The Cooper Orni- thological Society, and from a few other miscellaneous published sources. The material has been updated with references cited from the scientific literature through 1994, and new accounts were added. Skutch writes clearly, cleanly, and with a lot of content. To my taste he adds just enough anthropomorphism to be interesting, but not unscientific. The book includes historical vi- gnettes, personal asides, and insightful comments-all done in an economical, interesting manner. The sections on cowbirds alone are worth the price of the book. Beginning birders will enjoy the book and learn a great deal of fundamental ornithology. Advanced students will find much useful information and introduction to specific references. The reference section is not (nor was it intended to be) a comprehensive coverage of the blackbirds and their kin. Gardner's black-and-white sketches are excellent, the binding and covers attractive, and the book is well worth the money (particularly the paperback version). All-in-all this is a wonderful book. It stands as an example of the way in which bird books of this genre should be done.-C. R. BLEM. 809</page></plain_text>
