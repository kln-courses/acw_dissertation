<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOUR NEWLY ACQUIRED EXAMPLES OF JAPANESE ART Museum patrons occasionally find themselves drawn to an Oriental print or painting, a sculpture or decorative screen, for which their study of the his- tory of Western art has not prepared them. Though unfamiliar with Chinese and Japanese art forms, and the training that developed them, there is none- theless an immediate response for which their eye needs no previous conditioning-a tribute to the Oriental artist's ability to infuse his creations with a mood and spirit that have universal appeal. Four such objects, three fine sculptures and a two-fold screen, all Japanese, have recently been added to the Art Institute collection. All are the generous gift of Robert Allerton. It is always a pleasure for a curator to be able to report new acquisitions in any field within his jurisdiction. It is the more pleasant when, as is the case with the sculpture and screen under consideration, they are of a type not previ- ously represented in the museum. Such additions of fine quality are even more noteworthy when one considers the strong national restrictions which have in recent years made Japanese art of impor- tance increasingly difficult to obtain. Earliest in date are two of the sculptures; the haniwa figures of a warrior and of a horse. They may be dated 4th to 5th century A.D. The monu- ments of this Archaic or Tumulus Period were the great burial sites of the emperors and powerful lords. Often quite extensive in size, they bore testi- mony to the power and wealth of the Imperial family and important court figures. That of emperor Nintoku-tenn5 (c. 395-427 A.D.) reputedly took forty years to build. The most notable feature of these tumuli was the fence-like arrangement of clay cylinders or haniwa which surrounded them. Often perfectly plain, these cylinders were occasionally embellished with human figures, or more rarely with horses, houses or roosters. There are variations in quality and type, but both in execution and use the haniwa seem to have been a native tradition. Prior to the use of these terra-cotta pieces it had been the practice to bury important retainers and family with the deceased. If the written records may be trusted, the wails and lamentations of these unfortunates could be heard at some distance. This method of providing the departed with adequate servants in the life after death was understandably unpopular and it may be supposed that not infre- quently the less devoted tended to drift away as infirmity and death approached the master. The traditional originator of the clay replacements was Nomi no Sukune who in the reign of Suinin, prob- ably in the third century, recommended that clay effigies be substituted for the hapless retainers. The Art Institute figure is that of a warrior, poised and alert, ready to draw his sword. Like many other examples, this figure wears a close fitting helmet-like cap, a short, skirted tunic and high leggings. A necklace of beads is at his throat. The only other adornment is the checker-board cross-hatching incised on tunic, above and below the wide, tight belt, and on the cap. Aside from a few missing fragments on skirt and cap, and minor repairs to breaks at throat, arms and sword, the figure is in a remarkable state of preservation. The cylinder base and portions of the feet, it may be mentioned, are modern restorations. Of even more immediate appeal, and indeed not unlike a large toy, is the haniwa figure of a horse, excavated in Ibaragi Prefecture, Kanto District. Fully harnessed and saddled he stands ready to serve his master. These horses, because of their size and form have usually been excavated in fragments. Although there are some skillful repairs this example is in excellent condition. The elaborate harness trappings are of particular interest, with clay "rivets" at the strap crossings, and rein bells in front and back. Such fully caparisoned steeds and armed warriors give quite an interesting glimpse of the military life of feudal Japan. 11</page><page sequence="2">Shinto Deity, Zennyo-Ryuwo.

Certainly at their best these early clay figures have a directness and alert quality that create an immediate response on the part of the viewer. Though undeniably the work of craftsmen rather than creative artists or sculptors, they have a certain artistic significance as an indigenous Japanese art form. The two newly acquired exam- ples are of particular interest for the Art Institute. Prior to their acquisition museum visitors might have been justified in presuming that Japanese art sprang full-fledged into being in the tenth century. Quite unusual, historically and aesthetically, is the figure of a Shinto deity, Zennyo-Rvuwo. This "dragon-man" is the first plastic representation of a Shinto divinity in the Art Institute collection. Such figures are extremely rare, for Shinto, often de- scribed as "nurse of the arts" was seldom the patron. A reluctance to portray their gods in human form stems from the fact that these gods were regarded as spirits, and as such they in large part remained too mysterious to recreate in plastic or graphic form. Hosts of spirits crowded the land and very air of Japan and there were gods of hearth and home, field and forest. It is perhaps as well for the art historian, eager to identify and date. that there existed this antipathy to give their gods form. Not until the latter portion of the tenth century do we see the association of Buddhist and Shinto shrines in the same compound, and the attendant creation of anthropomorphic images of Shinto gods under the influence of Buddhist thought. These were the first faltering steps by which the native gods were em- braced and worshiped as avatars of the Buddhist ones. Buddhism, which had supplied nearly all the religious art of Japan since its importation in the sixth century, and which had largely obscured the native religion with its vast and complex iconogra- phy, in effect provided an impetus for the plastic representation of Shinto divinities. It is noteworthy, however, that even before this time the very artists and craftsmen who erected the Buddhist temples, cast the bronze images and painted the holy pic- tures, invoked the native Shinto spirits of timber, metal and pigment before starting their tasks. Interest in our figure centers about the slightly uplifted head, for here the sculptor lavished his greatest care and artistry. The rendering of the body is in fact cursory almost to the point of crudity, which was after all perhaps a conscious device to focus attention on the head and its elaborate dragon headdress. The body is covered only by a skirt-like garment, draped in apron-like fashion at the waist. Dipping low in back, it comes slightly above the knee in front. A few incised lines serve to indicate folds in the cloth, and similar incised grooves delineate belly and breasts. Both fore-arms are missing, as are portions of both feet. In all areas save the face, the chisel marks are plainly visible. The figure probably was originally entirely painted, although only bits and patches about the face, much blackened by smoke, remain. The head is a rather flat oval, with carefully defined, half-closed eyes, short nose and com- pressed lips. The expression is trance-like, almost ecstatic. A striking dragon ornament tops the figure. Poised with one claw firmly clamped above each ear of the man, and another on each shoulder, the mythical beast's serpentine tail falls down the middle of the back in "pigtail" fashion. The horned dragon head is alert, mouth open and fangs exposed. Iconographically, this dragon feature is the one clue which may eventually aid in the figure's identity. The problem of identification is made more difficult because so much of the recorded data concerning the Shinto religion is shot through with pious fabri- cations or is frankly mythological. Indeed the pri- mary histories were set down in written form only after many generations of oral transmission. The dragon itself is an extremely involved figure, sym- bolical of the utmost attainment and embodiment of all wisdom. In both China and Japan the dragon is a sun and cloud emblem, regulator of storms, and indirectly, of crops, the master of rivers and sea, and guardian of pearls and jewels. It is highly prob- able that the dragon peering above the head of this figure is indicative of a watery source for the deity's power. Probably carved in the late tenth century, the figure comes from a group said originally to have 14</page><page sequence="6">Hoitsu, 1761-1828. Two-fold Screen, Japanese, early 19th century.

Two of the group are registered in Japan. A third is in the Cleveland Museum. Izumo., on the West coast of Honshu Island is one of the points closest to Korea, and to the waves of influence from that country. The struggle between the position of the central Shinto deity, the sun goddess Amaterasu, and the gods localized around the province is barely con- cealed in the ancient histories. The Art Institute figure is perhaps the representation of such a local god. Of considerably later date is the two-fold bird and flower screen painted in color on paper, and bearing the signature of Hoitsu. Born on the first day of the seventh month of the eleventh year of Horeki (1761), Hoitsu was both poet and painter. He studied under several of the most eminent artists of his period, receiving instruction in such diverse methods as the Ukivoe. Kano and Chinese schools. In 1797, under the pretext of bodily infirmity he entered the Buddhist priesthood. His motives seemi not to have been entirely pious. Probably the strict adherence to ceremonial life demanded by the class into which he was born became increasingly irk- some, and donning the saffron robes of the Buddhist priest insured at least some time for artistic pur- suits. That he was more successful than perhaps he had even dared hope is borne out in the records. Obliged by the rules of his order to become curd of a fixed parish in Kyoto, he managed never to take up residence, but instead withdrew to suburban Tokyo where his home became a meeting-place for the artistic and literary greats of the period. He was apparently in daily life neither priest nor man of business, but first and foremost a painter and poet. A dedicated admirer of the brothers Korin and Kenzan, he managed to locate their lost graves, where he arranged for monuments to be set up. Later Hoitsu was responsible for publishing volumes of the collected works of Korin and Kenzan. His admiration, particularly for the former, may be seen in Hoitsu's paintings and in particular in the Art Institute screen. Screen-painting is essentially a Japanese expres- sion. Impressive castles with vast audience halls and long corridors became fashionable in the late 16th century and created a demand for suitable decora- tions to embellish their grandeur. It was a robust period and the new patronage, unlike that of the former aristocracy, was not particularly concerned with intellectual content. Subtlety of execution was not required. Fortunately a new generation of painters proved themselves equal to the challenge and the results, often breathtaking in effect. were screens of crimson and emerald, of green, violet and blue. These decorative splashes of color and pattern were in high favor for a full hundred years and earned for their makers the apt term of "the Great Decorators." The exuberance of the period, however, was spared the next logical step to vul- garity by Japanese taste, which retained an ele- gance even when restraint and understatement had given way to the flaunting and the gorgeous. The Art Institute screen by Hoitsu comes well after the last flowering of this flamboyant phase but there are echoes of the rich color and pattern of the earlier period. They are tempered though, by superb touclies of delicate brushwork, notably in the draw- ing of the mandarin ducks huddling on the snowx crags and taking off in flight. The colors are pre- dominiantly a rich red for the blossoms, warm grey anrid brown tonres on fowl. foliage and branches, with areas of blue anrid green in foliage and snow-covered( pilings. The stream which crosses the compositioil is a deep, sandy-textured blue with current lines of black. In certain areas, pools of other pigments were dripped on the wet colors to spread and partly blend, proIducing variegations of leaf and limb. The curved details of the red flowers as well as the falling snow- flakes, are further built up with thickening of gesso. The background, to enhance and set off this richness, is a sparkling spatter of gold. Striking in color and delicacy of line. the screen is an extremely impor- tant addition to the Art Institute collection. Spanning roughly fourteen hundred years in time. arind varying greatly in mood and manner, these four new acquisitions have little in common except their country of origin. Yet there is an addi- tional bond in that they are, in each case, almost purely an indigenous expression, relatively free from foreign influence or prototype. JACK SEWELL 16</page></plain_text>
