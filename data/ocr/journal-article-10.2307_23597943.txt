Spinoza's thinking is characterized here as an untamable, savage anomaly. The anomaly was not that Spinoza was the only one of the great thinkers of the early modern age who was not a Christian. Whatever Negri's reasons for calling him an anomaly, I would argue the most likely reason is that Spinoza was the only great philosopher who took the new, scientific way of thinking completely seriously, even down to its most unacceptable consequences. He considered the new science of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and others to really reveal the truth. In his eyes, this implied a devastating criticism of the whole traditional, Judeo-Christian worldview. Of course, later enlightenment thinkers would, partly under his influence, engage in similar criticism, but, as I will show, also with respect to them, Spinoza constitutes a new sort of anomaly. In his eyes, the rejection of the age-old beliefs did not and could not mean the dissolution of religion, since religion is such a powerful social phenomenon. Like all social phenomena, it appears in forms that can be more or less detrimental or advantageous to human well-being. This feature of religion has to be taken into account in any realistic form of political thinking. One of the central implications of the new, scientific way of thinking was the rejection of teleology or final causation in nature. Once this cornerstone of the traditional view is eliminated, all the other central doctrines come tumbling down as well, as Spinoza demonstrates with great clarity in the Appendix to Ethics I: All the prejudices that I undertake to point out here depend on one fact: that men commonly suppose that all natural things act on Correspondence to: Herman De Dijn, Institute of Philosophy, Kardinaal Mercierplein 2, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.

Indeed they think it certain that God himself directs all things towards a certain end, for they say that God has made everything on account of man, and man in order that he might worship God. This, therefore, I shall consider first. I shall seek first of all the cause of the fact that many people acquiesce in this prejudice, and that all people are inclined by nature to embrace it. Then I shall show that it is false, and finally how prejudices about good and bad, merit and wrongdoing, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and deformity, and other matters of this sort, have arisen from it. However, this is not the place to deduce these from the nature of the human mind. It will be sufficient if I take as a basis here something which everyone must admit: namely, that all human beings are born ignorant of the causes of things, and that all have an appetite for seeking what is useful to them, and that they are conscious of this. For from this it follows, first, that human beings think themselves to be free in so far as they are conscious of their volitions and of their appetite, and do not even dream of the causes by which they are led to appetition and to will, since they are ignorant of them. It follows, secondly, that human beings do everything on account of an end; namely, on account of something that is useful, which they seek. From this it comes about that they always seek to know only the final causes of things that have been done, and when they have heard these they are satisfied, because they have no cause for future doubt. But if they cannot learn these final causes from another, nothing remains for them but to turn to themselves and to reflect on the ends by which they themselves are usually determined to similar things, and so they necessarily judge the mind of another from their own mind. Further, since they find, both inside and outside themselves, many means which contribute greatly to the procurement of what is useful to them—for example, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, vegetables and animals for food, the sun for light, the sea for breeding fish—it has come about that they consider all natural things as if they were means to what is useful for them. And since they know that these means were discovered and not made by them, they had reason to believe that there is someone else who made these means for their use. For after they had considered things as means, they could not believe that they themselves had made these things, but they had to infer, from the means that they themselves commonly made for themselves, that there exists some governor or governors of Nature, endowed with human freedom, who have taken care of everything for them, and have made everything for their use. And since they had never heard anything about the mind of these beings, they had to judge it from their own, and so they asserted that the gods arrange everything for the use of men, in order that they might bind men to them and be held by them in the highest honor. From this it came about that each person, in accordance with his own way of thinking, thought out different ways of worshipping God, so that God might love them above the rest, and direct the whole of Nature to the advantage of their blind desire and insatiable avarice. So this prejudice turned</page><page sequence="3">SPINOZA ON TRUTH, RELIGION, AND SALVATION 547 into a superstition, and put down deep roots in the mind, which was the cause of the fact that each person endeavored mightily to understand and to explain the final causes of all things.1 Let us spell out what, in Spinoza's view, are the consequences of the new scientific view of Nature: 1. Anti-anthropomorphism. The new science shows the untenability of common-sense knowledge based on sense perception, and of the philosophical-theological worldview so closely allied with this common-sense thinking. The traditional worldview is anthropo morphic through and through. It is the result of a projection on reality of categories expressing our emotions, desires and illusions, rather than a view of things as they are in themselves. 2. Anti-anthropocentrism.2 Contrary to what we spontaneously believe, we are not, either individually, or as a group, or as a species, the center of things. These are childish, but almost inevitable thoughts, the result once again of a lack of knowledge and of human desire. What the new science tells us is that we, like all other things in nature, are the result of blind, efficient causes. Man is not a kingdom within the (divine) kingdom of nature. As Pascal, Spinoza's contemporary, also realized, we live on a tiny planet in some corner or another of an endlessly vast universe, the "silence" of which terrified him.3 3. Anti-providence. There are no final causes, there is no design or teleology in nature, and there is no divine providence.

There is no plan in which the Jewish people, or any other people, or any individual, plays a special role. An implication of this view is that the idea of progress, or of a movement towards a better future guaranteed by the nature of things, is also unacceptable. 4. Determinism. We are just one part of an unending process without purpose, part of the endless production of continually new combinations and configurations of things. Our body is like that of all other bodies governed by the iron laws of physics. This implies that all bodily actions are in principle perfectly explicable with respect to their causes and their effects. 5. No free will. If all bodies are completely determined, and if it is also true that the mind is simply the expression of the body in the realm of the attribute of Thought, then mental actions are equally completely determined. The parallelism of body and mind, interpreted as two real aspects of the same reality, leads inevitably to the denial of free will. Our will is nothing but the expression of conatus, the life force we happen to be. It is obvious that, according to Spinoza, the implications of the new scientific worldview are diametrically opposed to the basic tenets of Judeo-Christian religion: the belief in a personal God; the belief in a divine, providential plan within creation, with the Jewish people, and then with all believers and nonbelievers; the belief in a final judgment and in personal immortality, even of the body. All these beliefs are but the result of a lack of knowledge and irrational desires. Yet, paradoxically, this does not lead to a rejection of the notion of God (atheism), of notions of good and bad (cynicism), or of ordinary religion (antireligion). On the contrary, the first book of the Ethics bears as its title De Deo. Spinoza's philosophy is called an Ethics, having as its central problem the question of the good life, and his second masterpiece, the Tractatus Theologico-politicus, although containing a harsh critique of the superstitious forms of religion, accepts the possibility of a form or forms of religiosity that contribute to the peace and well-being of the ordinary believer.4 All of this means 4 See also Herman De Dijn, "Spinoza and Revealed Religion," Stuciia Spinozana 11 (1995): 39-52.</page><page sequence="5">SPINOZA ON TRUTH, RELIGION, AND SALVATION 549 that if Spinoza's philosophy is early enlightenment,5 it is a form of enlightenment that is very different from what is usually or often understood as enlightenment: an antireligious, amoral and atheistic ideology. In the following sections, Spinoza's peculiar form of modern thinking will be investigated with respect to three main topics: onto theology, ethics, and the theory of ordinary religion. II After the death of God, there is one illusion that is more alive than ever in our culture: the illusion of the self (and of the capacity and at the same time the obligation to give meaning to oneself on the basis of free will). Spinoza's denial of free will is also the denial of this Cartesian self. As Spinoza sometimes puts it, we are "like clay in the hands of the potter."6 Actually, there is not even a potter, but rather a blind watchmaker. Paradoxically, the philosopher who demolishes the illusion of the self continues to talk about God. De Deo are the first words of the Ethics. And the famous equation Deus sive Natura (not Natura sive Deus) appears for the first time only in the preface to Ethics IV.7 Spinoza clearly thinks it is possible to talk in a truly theoretical and nonanthropomorphic way about God. The "true" God must now be understood in light of the new reading of the book of nature by Galileo, who said that this book "is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these one is wandering in a dark labyrinth."8 For Spinoza it is also crucially true—as Richard 5 On the influence of Spinoza on the Dutch Early Enlightenment (and elsewhere), see Jonathan I.

Science is called on here to play its role within the framework of an onto-theology, leading to a new ethics.10 The idea of science (physics) as possibly connected with the search for the good life in full consciousness of the new view of things, and not simply as an instrument for the gratification of the whimsical desires of the self— this idea of science has been gradually lost in modern culture, even though it can be found in some exceptional figures, such as Einstein, who thought of himself as very close to Spinoza.11 Unless a nonanthropomorphic idea of God within the context of a scientific onto-theology is preserved, is the temptation not irresistible to consider science as just a machine for the pursuit of pleasure? Definition 6 of Ethics I provides us with Spinoza's conception of God: "an absolutely infinite entity, that is, a substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence." God, in other words, is the only really real or independent thing or substance; all other things are necessary modifications of this one substance, finite expressions of one of the eternal and infinite attributes constituting the nature of the substance. God is at the same time necessarily causa sui and causa omnium rerum,12 the source of all modifications of reality, for example, of all physical or mental forms of being studied in physics and psychology. Spinoza's God, as the ultimate Source of everything real, is an apersonal God. Infinite Intellect and Will are only (infinite) modifications of one of God's attributes. Infinite Intellect and Will do not belong to God's proper 9 Richard Mason, The God of Spinoza: A Philosophical Essay, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997). 10 See also Herman De Dijn, "Metaphysics as Ethics," in God and Nature.

They form, to use an expression of the Korte Verhandeling, a Son of God not having the same nature as the Father, who is not a Person at all.14 Spinoza clearly thinks that in order to properly link physics and psychology to ethics, it is necessary first to develop an onto-theology, to study the nature and properties of the Ultimate Source of everything, God.15 In Ethics I, Spinoza not only establishes the reality of God as defined in Def. 6 (in the proofs of God's existence);16 he also deduces the fundamental properties of God's nature1' and of God's power.18 Over the course of these demonstrations, it becomes clear that God should not be confused with the universe, with the totality of things. God is the Source, Force, or Energy (the Natura naturans) underpinning (substans) everything. The totality of all things, expressing God's nature and displaying its power, is called the Natura naturata. Before I go any further, I wish to explain here—-or rather to give a reminder—of what we are to understand by active and passive Nature [Natura naturans and Natura naturata]. For I judge that it has now been established by what has gone before that by 'active Nature' we are to understand that which is in itself and is conceived through itself, or, such attributes of substance as express eternal and infinite essence; that is . . . God, in so far as he is considered as a free cause. By 'passive Nature' I understand everything which follows from the necessity of the nature of God, or, of each of the attributes of God; that is, all the modes of the attributes of God, in so far as they are considered as things which are in God, and which can neither exist nor be conceived without God." The new philosophical ethics requires more than the theoretical insight that we are a necessary part of the infinite whole of things from which we emerged at a certain moment and into which we will inevitably disappear again. It finds its culmination in a new philo sophical religion which consists in knowledge, not of the whole, but of 13 Ibid., Ethics I, P17S; P31 and P32, Cor2.

This is obvious, if only from the titles of his major works, starting with the Korte Verhandeling (Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well-Being) and up to his Tractatus Politicus. Spinoza is a compatibilist: he accepts that the truth of determinism is compatible with advocating and trying to lead an ethical life. We know that good and bad are not objective categories of things, but because we humans are also inevitably striving beings, the question of the good life remains an inescapable question, even for the scientist. Scientist or not, we are constantly being affected in all sorts of ways that inevitably lead to desires with respect to the future. We inevitably try, using whatever information we can get as to means and ends, to repeat agreeable, good experiences, and to escape disagreeable, bad experiences. Even though everything is determined, the acquisition of more appropriate information can be a factor changing (in a determined way) the course of our behavior. New experiences, for example, the joy of scientific thinking, can (and will necessarily) change our conception of the good, and therefore our desires and activity. The new ethics of Spinoza presupposes two elements: 1) the discovery of higher forms of pleasure or of the good; 2) the discovery of scientific information about the causes and effects of our emotions and actions. The combination of those two factors leads to new desires for a higher good (the ideal of the really good life)21 guided by hypothetical imperatives that adapt causal insights to our striving (the precepts of reason concerning what is acceptable or unacceptable in our emotions.)22 The psychological insight into the causes and effects of jealousy, in combination with the desire for the highest good or the 20 See section 5 of this paper. 21 Spinoza, Ethics IV, P67-73. 22 Ibid., P38-66.</page><page sequence="9">SPINOZA ON TRUTH, RELIGION, AND SALVATION 553 life of the free man, leads to the insight that jealousy is bad (at least for the sort of individuals we have become). As a consequence we will (necessarily) try to escape situations leading to jealousy. In general, almost everybody sooner or later has the experience that the goods we ordinarily strive for—sensual pleasure, riches, honor—systematically lead to misery, to "moral sickness."23 On the contrary, the discovery of the comfort of philosophizing (inevitably) leads to a desire for the real good. According to the young Spinoza, this is the beginning of philosophy as an ethical endeavor (see the beginning paragraphs of the Tractatus de intellectus emendatione).21 The new ethics of Spinoza consists in a number of precepts of reason (dictamina rationis), which rational people will try to implement in order to come as close as possible to the model of the free man, the ideal of the good life. This is precisely the matter developed in Ethics, book IV. As the (only) axiom of Ethics TV indicates, human beings are just particular things, and of any particular thing it is true that there is always "another which is more powerful than it and by which it can be destroyed." This means that the endeavor of the rational man who knows about the real good and bad can always be overruled by circumstances. Secondly, emotions (like jealousy) can be conquered, not by rational thinking as such, but by rational thinking which itself is associated with stronger emotions. No wonder that Ethics IV bears the title "On human servitude, or, on the strength of the emotions."25 Even the rational man "is such that he is often compelled, even though he sees what is better for himself, to 23 Spinoza, Tractatus de intellectus emendatione, §7. 24 For an excellent introduction to the beginning, ethical paragraphs of the Tractatus de intellectus emendatione, see Theo Zweerman, L'introduction à la philosophie selon Spinoza.

Rather, I say this because it is necessary to know both the power and the lack of power of our nature... ."2S Ethics, the question of good and bad, would not exist, were it not for man's emotions and striving. The central ethical problem then concerns what difference that rational knowledge of the emotions and of the relative value of the goals they make us pursue can make in the real context of emotional life itself. Knowledge of the precepts (for example, about the undesirability of jealousy) is a rather abstract knowledge,29 and knowledge of the ideal of the good life is, as Spinoza says himself, more imaginary than real.20 No wonder that in real life, this knowledge is often not powerful enough emotionally to override pressing affects (like jealousy). The moral Spinoza draws from this is "to act well and to rejoice" (bene agere et laetari)31, to gladly accept the fact that we are only a part of Nature. The question is whether this almost stoic conclusion of Spinoza in Ethics IV is his final answer. We know, if only from the sequence of Book V, that it is not. The second part of his ethics properly speaking (Ethics V) culminates in a way of life that he himself describes as one of piety and religion, pietas et religio. However, first something must be said about his conception of ordinary, "revealed" religion, which provides a way of life not for the man who has tasted from the tree of knowledge, but for the many. 1 Spinoza, Ethics IV, Preface. 27 Ibid., P17S. 28 Ibid. 29 Ibid., P18S. 30 Ibid., P62S. 31 Ibid., P73S.</page><page sequence="11">SPINOZA ON TRUTH, RELIGION, AND SALVATION 555 IV Spinoza's encounter with modern thought and science meant that he could not remain faithful to his Jewish religion. We now know that his expulsion from the synagogue was due to his desire that a lawsuit he was involved in concerning his father's inheritance would be decided not, as custom required, by the Jewish court, but by the state magistrate.32 Nevertheless, it is clear that by that time (1656), he had already lost his faith. Interestingly enough, his attitude towards religion was not one of hatred; he became a student of religion as "a natural phenomenon,"33 a sociopolitical phenomenon of enormous importance. The result was his Tractatus Theologico-politicus. He was also one of the first to develop a scientific, exegetical, and hermeneutical study of the Bible.34 As a necessary tool for this study, he even wrote a Hebrew Grammar. In his theory of the emotions (Ethics III), Spinoza already shows that there is an intrinsic relation between emotions, politics, ethics, and ordinary religion.3' Without emotions like benevolence and self esteem, common-sense ethics is impossible to understand. Reference to the collective emotions of fear and hope, pride and recognition, along with anthropomorphic and anthropocentric ideas of the deity, is essential to an understanding of politics and religion, and their interconnection. In his Tractatus Theologico-politicus and Tractatus Politicus, Spinoza elaborates on these ideas. He demonstrates how fear and hope—provided they are combined with pride in the form of a desire to obtain an elevated place in the order of things, leading to the idea of a special election—are characteristic of what he calls 32 See Odette VIessing, "The Excommunication of Baruch Spinoza: a Struggle between Jewish and Civil Law," in Dutch Jewry: Its History and Secular Culture (1500-2000), ed., Jonathan Israel and Reinier Salverda (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2002), 141-172.

Religion works via stories, ceremonies, and rites, which give form to the religious emotions.37 People or groups in power or wanting power will inevitably make use of these strong social levers. Religion is neither the work of the devil, nor of pure unreason. It is a natural phenomenon which, depending on the circumstances, can take veiy different forms.38 As the subtitle of the Tractatus Theologico politicus indicates, the book's central task is to investigate the conditions under which freedom of thought (including philosophy and science), piety (religion), and peace (politics) can go together. There must then be forms of religion that allow this positive combination. Spinoza effectively distinguishes between superstition and what one could abbreviate as "purified" religion, purified, that is, of dogmatism and fanaticism.39 In the latter form, religion can contribute to a truly humane form of politics. What is most surprising, however, is that he sees religion as providing real salvation for the many, for those without the opportunity to embark on the "arduous way" 40 of philosophical salvation: "men can achieve blessedness simply through obedience without understanding."41 The fundamental emotions in which this salvation (beatitudo) of the believer consists are analogous to those present in philosophical religion: love of God and peace of mind.42 I say "analogous" because, in the case of the philosopher, these emotions must also be somehow different, since they presuppose other, adequate forms of cognition. This is why Spinoza says that the vera beatitudo can only be reached by the philosopher.43 Clearly, 36 Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-politicus, Preface.

Spinoza, to the contrary, has a realistic view of religion, just as he has of politics. Both are dominated by collective emotions, imaginations, and expectations. In both cases, these complexes can have an either disastrous or positive impact on human well-being. What is important here is to discover the causes responsible for either form, and to implement clever means of bending in the desired direction what cannot be avoided anyway. One important element Spinoza thought he had discovered in this respect was the necessity of a strict subordination of public religion to state power. It is remarkable that, in the Ethics, emotions, which the rational man considers as bad and which play an almost inevitable role in religion, are considered to be not only inevitable, but even good, from the point of view of the social good: Because men rarely live in accordance with the dictate of reason, these two emotions—namely humility and repentance, and besides these, hope and fear—bring more advantage than harm . . . For this reason it is not surprising that the prophets, who looked to the common advantage and not to that of a few, recommended humility, repentance and reverence so much. And indeed, those who are liable to these emotions can be led much more easily than others, so that they finally live in accordance with the guidance of reason, that is, so that they are free and enjoy the life of the blessed.46 44 Herman De Dijn, "Spinoza and Religious Emotions," section 4. 45 Spinoza, Ethics V, P42. 46 Ibid., IV, P54S.</page><page sequence="14">558 HERMAN DE DUN V As is clear from the Ethics itself, the ethics of the recta ratio,47 with its precepts of reason helping to achieve the ideal of the good life, is not Spinoza's final word. In Book V, Spinoza demonstrates what is required to transcend the attempt at a rational mastery of one's passions, which is characterized by inevitable setbacks and at best leads to a kind of stoic acceptance of life. Instead of talking about precepts and the ideal of the free man, Spinoza now speaks of remedies (remedia), which will consolidate man's virtue to such a degree that he is capable of real salvation. Spinoza discloses that, under certain conditions, the human mind can, so to say, produce medicines of its own, strengthening its health to such a degree that it reaches a state of real happiness. A careful investigation of these "remedies," a summary of which is offered by Spinoza himself,48 shows that they require a transition from the rational point of view towards a higher kind of knowing, an intuitive knowledge (scientia intuitiva), and to the way of life, emotions, and attitudes related to it.49 Again, it is clear that this ultimate development in ethical life operates within ordinary life, in the context of ordinary human emotionality. Salvation does not simply consist in the highest form of knowledge; this knowledge must at the same time be experience, emotion, or in other words, religion (religio). Yet, this religion is conditioned by and presupposes rational knowledge of the emotions, given by the theory of the emotions as developed in Ethics III. In this sense, it is a strictly modern, philosophical kind of religion. Reaching the state of true health, which is at the same time bliss, is like becoming eternal in time. This dual perspective, of reaching salvation in time, and of somehow escaping time in time, is explicitly present in the two subsections of Ethics V: Pl-20 and P21-40.

The culmination of Spinoza's ethics is not pietas, implying the appropriate relations vis-à-vis others (and oneself), but pietas et religio, implying a kind of religious relation between oneself and God, and via God, again to oneself and others. No wonder Spinoza did not want to give up the notion of God. What exactly is this intuitive knowledge? What are these emo tions and attitudes that constitute salvation? The interpretation of Ethics V is notoriously very difficult, leading many commentators to despair.60 Yet, it seems to me that major elements of Spinoza's thought can be established with sufficient certainty.61 The good life does not consist in eliminating the passions, which is only possible in death; rather, it consists in mastering the passions through knowledge. This mastery involves the presence of new active emotions, which constitute blessedness or salvation. The knowledge that produces mastery over our emotions and leads to blessedness consists primarily in a rationally-based knowledge of the emotions that inevitably affect us in our daily life. Still, it is not rational knowledge by itself that is important; it is rational knowledge of emotions as applied to our concrete emotional life. What is required is to be attentive to our own emotional life, and to consider our own emotions from the objective, rational perspective. However, one more element is necessary. In order to arrive at intuitive knowledge, the emotions, our emotions, thus contemplated, must be seen at the same time as particular and specific effects of God's power. In the same breath, the joy produced by this contemplation and this contemplation itself are grasped as effects of God. This inevitably leads to love of God (Amor Dei),d2 a love for a God who "[s]trictly speaking . . . loves no one and hates no one."53 This is the salvation of the philosophical religion. In the second section of Ethics V (P20-40), Spinoza further inves tigates both intuitive knowledge and the active emotions, in which our blessedness or highest happiness consists. Intuitive knowledge is 50 See Jonathan Bernett, A Study of Spinoza's Ethics (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1984), 357. 51 Excellent commentaries here are: Alexandre Matheron, Individu et communauté chez Spinoza (Paris: Minuit, 1969), and Pierre Macherey, Introduction à l'Ethique de Spinoza.

This glory we experience is totally void of conceit, because we know at the same time that all we are and all we are capable of is ultimately God's doing.58 That contentment of mind or bliss, which is at one with our understanding and loving God, automatically becomes praise of God. Self-glorification is reverence.5" In effect, there are two perspectives in Ethics V, but it seems unnecessary to talk about a progression in stages as some commentators do.60 The second perspective seems to clarify in the first a certain dimension, the dimension of eternity, the dimension of the breakthrough in time of real freedom as related to the reaching of intuitive knowledge and the active emotions going with it. It is in real life that the mind reaches an intuitive view of things sub specie aeternitatis61 and experiences the kind of emotions that constitute eternal blessedness. In the Korte Verhandeling, Spinoza called this "coming to be eternal" in time a "rebirth" (wedergeboorte).62 Contentment of mind does not involve an awareness of time, but a timeless joy or contentment, blessedness itself, in other words, "the 04 Ibid., P24-31. 55 Ibid., P32 Cor. 56 Ibid., P27 Dem. 57 Ibid., P36S. 58 Ibid. 59 For a contemporary study of the importance of reverence, see Paul Woodruff, Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001). 60 See also Herman De Dijn, "Ethik aïs Heilkunde des Geistes," 273. 61 Spinoza, Ethics V, P29 and P29S. 62 Spinoza, Korte Verhandeling, 1:22 (1:100.7).</page><page sequence="17">SPINOZA ON TRUTH, RELIGION, AND SALVATION 561 mind [simply being] endowed with perfection itself."63 Spinoza does consider the mind to be "eternal, or immortal"; but this immort ality has nothing to do with personal existence "after death,"64 as people usually think.66 Spinoza describes religion as follows: "whatever we desire and do of which we are the cause in so far as we have an idea of God, i.e., in so far as we know God, I relate to 'religion'."66 Religion then is desire and action as related to our knowledge of God. Ethics V shows that without the active emotions of an intellectual love of God and a reverence towards God, the desires and actions constituting religion could not exist.67 Blessedness is not the reward for piety and religion, for the active desires and actions towards others and towards God;68 blessedness is piety and religion.69 Blessedness "is simply the contentment of mind that arises from the intuitive knowledge of God, the attributes of God, and the actions that follow from the necessity of his nature.'"0 VI How should one make sense of all these quasi-religious words and utterances which at the same time urge us to leave behind their meaning in ordinary religion? "Immortality or eternity" has nothing to do with "immortality" in the sense of a reward in the afterlife for a life of piety and religion. How can there be salvation without hope for personal immortality? How can there be eternal bliss in time? How can there be love of and reverence for a God that is the apersonal substance or Natura Naturans? It is possible to track down all the proofs made by Spinoza on these topics, and yet to fail completely to 63 Spinoza, Ethics V, P36S. 64 Ibid., P41S. 65 On Spinoza's views on immortality, see Steven Nadler, Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2001), reviewed by Herman De Dijn in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie 64 (2002): 614-15. œ Spinoza, Ethics IV, P37 SI. 67 See also Herman De Dijn, "Spinoza and Religious Emotions," section 3. 68 Spinoza, Ethics V, P41S. 69 Ibid., P42. 70 Ibid., IV, App. 4.</page><page sequence="18">562 HERMAN DE DUN see what it is all about. Spinoza seems to be aware of this himself. He requires us to have certain experiences and certain emotions as we go along with the proofs. Only then will "we sense and experience that we are eternal."71 Perhaps it is possible to get an inkling of what it is all about by making certain comparisons with other forms of religiosity. There is the form in which salvation is equally divorced from ideas of a per sonal, anthropomorphic God and personal immortality, but is, on the contrary, related to the idea of an impersonal Godhead and a reality that is completely without purpose, sometimes even described as Nothingness. In a very interesting chapter on "Spinozistic Pantheism," Timothy Sprigge compared some of Spinoza's ideas "with aspects of Hindu feeling which find something to reverence in the terrifying side of nature, as well as in its benign side."72 One can also try to compare Spinoza with other thinkers in the West who advocated a nontheistic religiosity as related to a rational scientific worldview, for example, with Einstein, whom one can consider as a kind of Spinozist. Einstein saw science not primarily as a means for progress, but as a great, meaningful endeavor in its own right, which should be pursued for its own sake. He thought that the preservation of this great and meaningful endeavor was almost impossible without reverence for Nature. Scientific investigation of nature could even, at moments of grace, result in or be accompanied by a cosmic religious feeling, a kind of religious feeling of awe and reverence towards Nature.73 Here, I myself will use another strategy. I will try to evoke what it is all about by investigating not the thought of a like-minded philosopher-and-scientist, but (part of) a poem by a soulmate scientist and-poet. The poem called "Begrip" ("Understanding") is to be found in Leo Vroman's 1989 collection of poems Dierbare OndeelbaarheicL / 71 Ibid., V, P23 S.

In this poem, the scientist sees his own activity and his own emotions as part of nature, a part in which nature paradoxically comes to self reflection. In self-reflection, the scientist knows the joy of understanding, but at the same time recognizes this understanding as inevitably somewhat illusory, not because it is in any way doubtful, but because he realizes that what seems to be his highest creativity is but nature acting through him. In this subtle recognition of himself and of his self-conscious activity, the scientist comes to a tender acceptance of himself ("beloved nature"), and a love for that of which he is a part ("I embrace Nature"). Insight into what may look like a harsh truth (that I am only a part of Nature) combines with the joyful experience 74 Leo Vroman, Dierbare ondeelbaarheid (Amsterdam: Querido, 1989), 24.

The whole dialectic of this peculiar self-perception and emotional self-awareness combined with the awareness of and feelings towards the apersonal God-Nature poetically described here, seems to me to be very close to what Spinoza tried to describe as blessedness or salvation. A kind of love and reverence is possible towards an apersonal Godhead. The seeing of the nonanthropomorphic and non anthropocentric truth is paradoxically combined with salvation.
