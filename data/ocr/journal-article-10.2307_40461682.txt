<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Meaning of Maya Myths Anthropos 84.1989: 20S-212 Aleksandar Boskovic Abstract. - The article deals with the hypotheses and ap- proaches in the study of Mesoamerican religions, focusing on the Maya tradition. Maya myths are examined and compared to other traditions of this part of the world, with the particular stress on the cosmological aspects of the Hunahpu's and Xba- lanque's descent in the Underworld. The author also examines some of the evidence on the Maya moon goddess, as well as concepts of fantastic mythological creature(s) uniting in itself the fundamental opposites. - It is suggested that the area of in- fluence of Maya moon goddess is much wider than generally considered; it also seems that the concepts of deities like It- zamná and Kukulcán arose from the biologically impossible creatures that were represented in the "Izapan" or "proto-Ma- ya" culture.

(Edmonson 1971: 9-10; lines 125-128) Understanding Maya myths is of supreme impor- tance for comprehending their religion - more pre- cisely, a variety of cults1, rituals, and beliefs that form their "part" in Mesoamerican religions. This complex is very specific because of the great num- ber of common beliefs and similar rituals, as well as numerous deities that have common traits in differ- ent civilizations: from the Olmec and Teotihuacán to the Zapotec, Toltec, Mixtec, and Aztec. In this universe of extraordinary cultures the Maya have a very important place. However, each study of their religion is rendered much more difficult by the lack of the sources; on the other hand, the little we know comes mostly from the Postclassic period (ca. 10th-16th century CE), and the question about the extent of continuity of the Classic and Postclassic is still open (cf., for example, Edmonson 1979: 157-166). What survived are stelae, lintels, reliefs, bas-reliefs, and figurines and sculptures on one side - and ceramics and oral tradition on the other, with few manuscripts written down during the co- lonial period, of which "Popol Vuh" is the most important for the subject of this paper. The trails of ancient beliefs could be found even in very "Christian" ceremonies of the present-day Maya, as noted by Thomas Gann (1918: 40): "Nominally, they are Christians, but the longer one lives among them, and the better one gets to know them, the more he realizes that Christianity is to a great ex- tent merely a thin veneer, and that fundamentally their religious conceptions and even their ritual and ceremonies are survivals - degenerate, much changed, and with most of their significance lost - but still survivals of those of their ancestors of pre-Columbian days." Having in mind all these obstacles, it is no wonder that there are only a few useful studies of Maya religion. But it is in the last 15 years that we are witnessing the gradual accumulation of knowl- edge on different aspects of their culture, including religion. If we turn to mythology, a very important break has been made by the decipherment of most Mayan hieroglyphs, study of ceramics found in the dignitaries' tombs2 started by Michael D. Coe, great progress made in the study of art and iconog- raphy, and works that point to the legacy of ancient beliefs in the present-day communities (and among the people who greatly contributed in this part is Dennis Tedlock with his new edition of "Popol Vuh"). There has been a lot of dispute about the 1 For the definition of cult which is in my opinion especially valid for the religious complexes of this part of the world, I refer to Brundage (1985: 4 ff.). He stresses that "Failure in it [cult -A.B.] leads to the disorientation of the group and the unpinning of its value systems." 2 Although this is not a very precise term, since "dignitaries" could have been from the first five groups listed by Ham- mond (1982: 197) in his general account on the social struc- ture of Maya society.</page><page sequence="2">204 Aleksandar BoSkovic methodological approach in the study of iconogra- phy, which directly influences the study of religion and myths; on the one hand, there is so-called "di- rect historical approach," based on the compara- tive study of other Mesoamerican civilizations (most of all, the Aztec), as well as on modern eth- nological research - this approach was accepted by many of the leading authorities in Maya studies to- day (Gordon R. Willey, M. D. Coe, etc.), and I think that its best presentation and defense against the critics was that of Henry B. Nicholson (1976: 157-175). On the other side is intrinsic configura- tional iconographie analysis proposed by George Kubier (cf. 1972) - accepted by many European scholars and students, and recently developed by Nicholas M. Hellmuth in his brilliant study of Ear- ly Classic iconography, where he proposes the so-called "Mayan model" for the study of ancient Maya culture in its various forms. But the subject of this article is the meaning of Maya myths, especially regarding customs and be- liefs of other Mesoamerican peoples, and the fact that about some of them we know much more (those from the Valley of Mexico in the first place) . I prefer to call this a comparative approach, which does not mean that I take data from other cultures to interpret Maya myths - my only interest is in comparing them, because certain "types" or "models" are encountered in different traditions (which doesn't mean that they were "carried" by someone from culture to culture), suggesting the similar models of the manifestations of the sacred. It will become obvious that in some cases we deal with patterns characteristic for this part of the world, while in others Maya tradition keeps a sort of "exclusiveness." I must note that I use the word myth to denote a traditional tale, the one aiming at symbolic explanation of the world around us and the paradoxical ambiguity of human existence, as well as at the justification of the present hierarchy and social order (among gods or men). We do not deal with some sort of "pre-scientific" or "pro- to-scientific" thinking - the point is that everything important and fascinating was to be explained through the mythic thinking as the adequate sphere of symbolic expression. It excludes bivalent logic and many other relations familiar to us (be- fore-after; cause-effect; etc.). Myth as symbol of- fers ground for development and extension of all human intellectual and creative activity; especially inclination for the gathering and classifying of no- tions and concepts - very soon enabling mythical heroes to become subject(s) of religious cults. The evidence we have justifies the term "Maya myths": despite the regional, language, and cultural differ- ences there is a corpus of myths common to the ma- jority of Maya groups, as well as for their Meso- american neighbors. Of course, we shall deal only with characteristic myths: the ones on creation, di- vine hero-twins, and moon goddess. 1. Ages of the World [The day] 4 Ahau will be creation. [The day] 4 Ahau will be darkness. Then were born the heart of creation, the heart of darkness. (Roys 1965: 6) The myth of the periodical cosmic destruction and renovation, the so-called "ages of the world" (or suns in Náhuatl tradition), is common for all Meso- american cultures, and has also parallels among the Indians from the Southwest of the USA. Ac- cording to the version that was given by Tozzer (1907: 153-154) - and based on the informants from the vicinity of Valladolid - the present world is in its fourth "age." At first, it was inhabited by zayamuincob ("the disjointed men"), dwarfs capa- ble of carrying large stones on their hunched backs; this and their miraculous ability to bring firewood to the hearth by whistling, enabled them to build ancient cities and huge paved roads. There also existed a great road suspended in the sky, stretching from Tulúm and Coba to Chichén Itzá and Uxmál. A great living rope was also connected with this road (blood flowed in the interior of it), and it served as a mean by which gods were sending food to the ancient cities' rulers. In the course of time men had become wicked, so gods decided to destroy the world using the flood hayiokocab ("water over the earth"). The rope was cut, all blood flowed out, and it disappeared forever. Until then all was still in darkness, but suddenly the sun rose for the first time, and its rays turned industri- ous dwarfs into stones. In the next creation, there lived people called dz'olob (Thompson proposed the translation "offenders," but it's far from clear how did he get to it), but they were destroyed with another flood. In the third period, the world was inhabited by macehualli (Náhuatl word for "ordi- nary people"), ancestors of the present-day Ma- yas, and were destroyed by hunyecil ("hurricane and earthquake") or bulcabal. Finally, the present world is inhabited by the descendants of all ancient races, and it is going to disappear after the flood (according to "Relación de Merida," fire - but we must remember that, for the ancient Mesoameri- cans, water and fire were not opposites!). According to "Popol Vuh", the first people were just "dolls made of wood" - they watched . . . Anthropos 84.1989</page><page sequence="3">The Meaning of Maya Myths 205 talked . . . multiplied ... but had no heart or soul, they were not even aware of their creators - so they had to be destroyed: Then their flood was invented by the heart of Heaven A great flood was made, and descended on the heads Of those who were dolls Who were carved of wood. (Edmonson 1971: 25-26) Besides this heavy resin, their utensils and do- mestic animals also had prominent part in their an- nihilation. From the few survivors descend the monkeys. ... In the second creation, it seemed that the work of the gods was well executed, since the people were really brilliant: They came to see; They came to know Everything under heaven If they could see it. (Edmonson 1971: 150) But the gods were far from being satisfied with their brilliancy: "It is not good What they said, Our forming Our shaping: We know everything great And small," they said. And so they took back again Their knowledge, Did Bearer And Engenderer. (Edmonson 1971: 151-152) The first pair of divine hero-twins, 1 Hunter (Hun Hunahpu) and 7 Hunter ( Vuqub Hunahpu), were defeated by the Lords of the Underworld (Xr- balba, "place of dread"). This world was also in- habited by giants, led by 7 Parrot ( Vuqub Kaqix, but I find completely plausible Hellmuth's expla- nation that this is actually Harpy Eagle God) and his sons Alligator (Cipacna) and 2 Leg (Kaab r Aqan). They were all killed by the next pair of he- ro-twins who, afterwards, proceeded to defeat the Lords of the Underworld. Of special interest of all these giants is the story of Alligator, whose only "sin" seems to have been some sort of hybris, and who slayed 400 young men - an episode resembling similar adventure of the great Mexico- Aztec war- rior god Huitzilopochtli. In the third creation dramatic showdown be- tween the hero-twins and the Lords of the Under- world took place; and finally, in the fourth cre- ation, people were made of yellow and white maize. According to the Mexican tradition, the first creation was 4 Jaguar (naui ocelotl)3, and the world was inhabited by giants. After 13 periods of 52 years they were devoured by jaguars. Tezcatli- poca was the sun of this age. The second was named 4 Wind (naui eecatl), and Quetzalcóatl was its sun. After 7 periods of 52 years this world was destroyed when terrible winds swept away houses, trees, and people, and survivors were turned into monkeys. The next creation was 4 Rain (naui quiauitl), and Tlaloc was its sun. After 6 times of 52 years it was ended by fire raining down from the sky and volcanic eruptions. This world was inhab- ited by children, who were afterwards turned into birds. The fourth creation was 4 Water (naui atl), its sun being goddess Chalchiuhtlicue. After 13 times of 52 years the world was destroyed with floods and people were turned into fish. Finally, we live in the time of the fifth creation, 4 Move- ment (naui ollin), whose sun is Tonatiuh. People were made of bones brought from the Underworld by Quetzalcóatl, and the world will be destroyed during a series of earthquakes. This symbolism is far more complex when we have in mind that, for example, jaguars were be- lieved to represent "des forces obscures de la terre, de tout le mystère qui rôde 'au coeur des mon- tagnes'" (Soustelle 1967: 8). The feline cult is the most prominent form of Olmec religion, where it can be traced as far as in the 12th century BCE; but it is also characteristic for the South American cul- tures (ca. 850 BCE in Chavin, Peru). It seems that many different cultures regarded jaguar as their ancestor, and the continuity of this belief was pre- served in the time of the Conquest, since "the jag- uar was an important emblem of their [Aztec] all-powerful Smoking Mirror God [Tezcatlipoca]" (Davies 1982: 48). These myths have numerous variations,4 but they all reflect basic concepts of these cultures: that the world is periodically being created and de- stroyed. Here, destroying should not be taken as a mere destruction; essentially, it represents renova- 3 In this brief account I follow the most widely accepted or- der, but León-Portilla (1961: 14-17) gives these ages in dif- ferent order: 4 Atl, 4 Ocelotl, 4 Quiauitl, 4 Eecatl, 4 Ollin - based on the XVI century manuscript known as "Anales de Cuauhtitlán." 4 It is very interesting to compare these traditions with the ones from American Southwest. Hopis believe that they have come to earth, the Fourth world, after passing from three other worlds, and each world is placed in the layer above the former one. A very complex Navaho myth ex- plains how their ancestors reached the Fifth world, the world we live in, using extremely intriguing symbolism (for the Hopi tradition cf. Harold Courlander 1982; and the Na- vaho myth is reprinted in Frederick W. Turner 1974). Anthropos 84.1989</page><page sequence="4">206 Aleksandar BoSkovic tion, the new world is always better than the for- mer one. What seems unusual is the difference in num- ber of the "ages of the world" in two Mesoameri- can traditions: (usually) four for the Maya; and (usually) five for the people from the Valley of Mexico. But both numbers mark the same basic concept: Maya tradition mentions four cosmic trees (yaxche) placed at the four world directions - which denote their color: red at east, white at north, black at west, and yellow at south. This idea unites the image of the "tree of life" (with treetop belonging to the heaven, trunk to the earth, and roots to the underworld) as axis mundi with the idea of numinous "bearers" (which, like Hellenic Atlantes, hold the sky on their shoulders). Such "fusion" of two cosmological concepts havç in the course of time caused the change from the belief that the world is "supported" by four trees into the one more anthropomorphic; i.e., that it is "sup- ported" by four gods. The Náhuatl myth explains that, when Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcóatl have de- stroyed the world with a flood, four men survived - so the gods transform them into the trees and place them at the four corners of the world. The Maya "bearers" were known as Bacabs, and their oldest representation was found at the Temple 22 at Copán, dating from the 8th century CE (Baudez et Becquelin 1984: 384). In his "Relación de las cosas de Yucatan" Landa (Tozzer 1941: 135-136) wrote about them: "Among the multitude of gods which this nation worshipped they worshipped four, each of them called Bacab. They said that they were four brothers whom God placed, when he created the world, at the four points of it, holding up the sky so that it should not fall. They also said of these Bacabs that they escaped when the world was de- stroyed by the deluge." By determining four basic points they also determine the disposition of par- ticular years towards people (Landa witnessed the New Year ceremonies where Bacabs were of great importance) - and that is where the role of priests as "mediators" became very important. But why number 4? - In Mesoamerican ico- nography, that number is connected with the sun (Beyer 1928: 32 ff.) - representing its creative power as "life-giver" and "fire in the sky." When the sun appeared for the first time (13.0.0.0.0. 4 Ahau 8 Cumku), the Maya started their "Long Count" (Spanish Cuenta larga). It is quite predict- able that the sun, whose daily and nightly journey5 dominate the great part of Maya religion,6 and which witnesses and participates all the important events in the sky and in the realm of Xibalba, de- termines the ages of the world. And it is quite natu- ral that these ages were called "suns" in the Náhuatl tradition. The fifth age is a sort of "appendix" derived from the need to "unite" four sides of the world; so beside four sacred trees (yaxche), the fifth - green one - will be placed in the center. On the other hand, great importance of rain and related divini- ties throughout Mesoamerica must not be forgot- ten, since 5 is also a cipher that "symbolizes" rain (Beyer 1928: 36). And this also reminds us of the cosmological concepts of North American Indians, where beside four points for the world directions, the fifth {pou sto) is added in the very center, signi- fying the observer (Alexander 1920: 52). Sun symbolism in Maya myths is connected with many scenes, mostly on ceramic vessels, but it is also very intriguing when we follow the adven- tures of the divine hero-twins. The myth of the divine hero-twins is charac- teristic for all the American Indian traditions. They are present in myths and tales both as legend- ary ancestors and heroes that are about to over- come various trials. The most interesting detail re- garding 1 Hunter (Hunahpu) and Jaguar-Sun (Xbalanquë) is their role in the creation of the world. Edmonson's "Second Creation" obviously places them in the same world as the giants. Their ancestors, the Maize Twins (1 Hunter and 7 Hunt- er), were defeated in the sacred ball game by the Lords of Xibalba and ritually decapitated. There- fore, Hunahpu and Xbalanque went to "avenge" them and to (on the cosmic level) defeat Death. Their descent metaphorically represents the descent of the sun, and, on a broader scale, it serves as an example of what trials the deceased 5 After sunset it is to become a "Jaguar-Sun," which is led by the young moon goddess towards the place where it will be ritually decapitated; but the female counterpart of the great underworld jaguar - analogous to the Aztec Tepeyollotl ("Heart of the Mountain") - will just before dawn give birth to a new sun, now led by the old moon goddess towards the place where it is supposed to start another day. 6 For the astronomical details and data in Mayan inscrip- tions, cf. Dütting (1984). It is interesting to note that the on- ly tomb on whose walls the cardinal points were marked in a right way has been recently excavated at Rio Azul, Guate- mala (cf. Adams 1986). The meaning of number 4 can also be very significant regarding the Aztec ritual sacrifice of the ixiptia of goddess Xilonen: "it was said 'she enters the sand' because in this way she made known her death - that on the morrow she would die - . . ." (Dibble 1980: 199). The Maya Great Goddess (which I consider to be the moon goddess in her various manifestations) could be mentioned here, for one of her names was, literally, "The One that Emerges from the Sand." Anthropos 84.1989</page><page sequence="5">The Meaning of Maya Myths 207 ruler is about to encounter on his journey. But they will be much wiser and more skilled than their fa- ther and uncle (although Hunahpu will, during the night in the house of Killer Bat, also be decapi- tated, but his brother will for some time replace his head with a squash), and finally defeat the "Lords of the Night," sacrifice two lords, and disperse oth- ers. After all their exploits, . . . they walked back up Here amid the light, And at once They walked into the sky. And one is the sun, And the other of them is the moon. (Edmonson 1971: 144) A new ritual pattern is established after their victory.7 Until their descent, the Lords of the Un- derworld were absolutely merciless: Death was the supreme ruler, and its superiority was confirmed by the sun sacrifice already mentioned above. Hunahpu and Xbalanque did not abolish the sacrifice: Hunahpu (Quiche day corresponding to Yucatec 1 Ahau, day that "belongs" to the sun god [Thompson 1950: 87-88] - but among the Quiche Maya today the word junajpu also signifies player par excellence) will be decapitated - but he will get his head back in a miraculous way. (The defeated players in the sacred ball game were also decapi- tated.) Death and rebirth are suggested with the appearing of hero-twins in the form of men-fish (cf. Tedlock 1985: 289-290); furthermore, it seems that many Mesoamerican Indians believed that gods "catch" fish - representing human embryos that float in the mythical lake whose Náhuatl equivalent is Tamoanchán (Dütting 1976: 42- 43 ff. ) . This is also suggested on the Bone MT-5 1 : A of Tikal Temple 1, Burial 116, in the scene showing three longnosed gods (identified as Chac Xib Chacs, but it should not be forgotten that long- nosed heads were also aspects of Itzamná) captur- ing fish. And that is another aspect as resurrection, perhaps the most important mark of the victorious divine twins. Except this establishment of a new ritual pattern, this victory was eternalized in the sun's "taking over" of the ball game; and in that extraordinary ambience the sun's underworld suf- fering will be experienced forever. 2. The Great Goddess and the Mystery of Creation Who is your tree? Who is your bush? What was your trunk when you were born? (Roys 1965: 4) The above incantation reflects an ancient belief that can be found even today among the Maya: that a certain animal or plant "watches" the fate of each individual. "Ritual of the Bacabs" shows the shaman's and medicine man's efforts to "reveal" which plant "guards" the sick one; this knowledge would enable him to cure the plant, too, and to find the exact place where sickness is located. This be- lief probably results from the ancient fascination with the mystery of life, imposing veneration of an- cestors (ancestor cult among the Maya had enor- mous significance for all aspects of life; evidence for this are burials of the descended under the floor of the house, and keeping their skulls on the spe- cial place, where they would receive ritual offer- ings, etc.). More generally, it resulted in the con- necting of the human birth and plants' germina- tion, which puts man's fate in the hands of the Great Goddess. Furthermore, everyone has its "animal spirit companion" - Náhuatl nahual. (On its underworld journey, the deceased is led by the horrible dog known among the Yucatec Maya as Xul - Náhuatl Xolotl, Aztec Xulotl) Or, as summed by Vogt (1969: 372): "Each person and his animal spirit companion (vay-j-el or wayhel in most Tzotzil communities, but chanul in Zina- cantán) share the same soul (ch'ulel in Tzotzil). Thus, when the ancestral gods install a soul in the embryo of a Zinacanteco, they simultaneously in- stall the same soul in the embryo of an animal. Sim- ilarly, the moment a Zinacanteco baby is born a su- pernatural jaguar, coyote, ocelot, or other animal is born. Throughout life, whatever happens of note to the Zinacanteco happens to the animal spirit companion, and vice versa . . ." These "animal spirit companions" are kept in some sort of corral by the ancestral deities. This "installment of the soul" was probably done by the Great Goddess, and in the Maya pan- theon we meet her in at least two important as- pects: as young moon goddess (Yucatec Ixchel), and as an old goddess with jaguar claws and spouse of the creator god, Ix Chebel Y ax. Both can be rec- ognized among the four goddesses that Landa (Tozzer 1941: 10) mentions as the ones venerated at the island Cozumel - Ix Chel, Ix Chebel Yax, Ix Hunie, Ix Hunieta. There is some evidence that suggests the latter two are the same deity, and the question about the actual relationship between Ix- 7 In his edition of the "Popol Vuh," Dennis Tedlock stresses the ritual significance of their exploits; they are most likely representing the sun and Venus (cf. Tedlock 1985: 296- 297). Anthropos 84.1989</page><page sequence="6">208 Aleksandar BoSkovié chel and Ix Chebel Yax is very interesting (cf. Toz- zer 1941: notes 46, 47); Thompson (1939) regarded them as the same deity, but later (1970) changed his mind. It seems that Landa considered them to be mother and daughter, as did Knorozov (1964: 3). However, if we accept the general no- tion that Maya deities (and Mesoamerican as well; for the detailed treatment of the attributes of mer- chant gods see Thompson 1966) revealed them- selves in various aspects, these two could be treat- ed as one deity. Ixchel is also being mentioned as a goddess of childbirth and medicine in Landa's manuscript, while Scholes and Roys give more in- formation in their excellent monograph (1948: 57): "Ix Chel was evidently a very popular deity among the Chontal generally. Her shrine on Cozumel Is- land off the northeastern coast of Yucatan was vis- ited by pilgrims from Tabasco, and the site of Tix- chel, which was twice occupied by Acalan, was ap- parently named for her. As Seler pointed out, the names of Ciuatecpan ('palace of the woman') on the Usumacinta and of Ciuatan ('the place of the woman') in central Tabasco must refer to her wor- ship. Landa notes that Isla de Mujeres ('island of the women') north of Cozumel was named for the idols of goddesses which were found there. He names Ix Chel and three others, but Tozzer sug- gests that at least two of them were the same deity. In Tabasco on the Rio Chico, a branch of the Usu- macinta, is a site named Cuyo de las Damas, which may well refer to Ix Chel also. She was probably the goddess to whom, according to Cortês, the people of Teutiercas in Acalan dedicated their principal temple. In her 'they had much faith and hope.' In her honor 'they sacrificed only maidens who were virgins and very beautiful; and if they were not such, she became very angry with them.' For this reason they took especial pains to find girls with whom she would be satisfied and brought them up from childhood for this purpose." While the reliability of Cortes' account can be doubted, this sort of sacrifice is similar to the one that Aztecs had in the month Ochpaniztli, particu- larly to the sacrifice of the ixiptla of the goddess Chicomecóatl ("Seven Snake") (Brundage 1985: 51-54) - but they made sacrifices to the four as- pects of their Great Goddesses. Of these aspects very interesting is Toci ("Grandmother"), since her equivalent among the Yucatec Maya would be Ix Chebel Yax. Originally the Great Goddess (and the moon goddess, too) of the Huaxtecs, she was "via Culhuacán" absorbed into the Aztec panthe- on (Brundage 1985: 51). As an old goddess, she re- minds us of the image of the Ix Chebel Yax on the page 74 of "Codex Dresdensis"; but it is also worth Fig. 1: Ixchel as a goddess of fate as depicted in the "Codex Dresdensis," 19 c. [All drawings by Lidija Taranovié] noting that weaving and embroidering, which are attributed to wanton Ixchel,8 are supervised by (and actually are emblems of) Ix Chebel Yax. Her role as the goddess of fate is in the "Codex Dres- densis" stressed with the prefix zac. This prefix means white, chastity, and virginity - and all this is also connected with the name of the young moon goddess as White Ix Chel (Roys 1965: 154). Be- sides page 19 of this codex, which shows Ixchel car- rying man's fate on her back, this is also suggested by the analogy between kin (meaning sun, day, time), and k'in (to weave, to weave cotton on the loom, cloth) (Dütting 1974: 13). Ixchel was also known as "The One that Emerges from the Sand" - and, taking into ac- count the Náhuatl belief (cf. note 6!), this could ex- press her superiority over Death. This could also explain her role in bringing the sun to the under- world altar. She was also considered as an ances- 8 Her connection with the spindle associates her with the spi- der (Thompson 1939: 147-149), but also with fate (BoSkovic η. d.).

Résumé: The Character of Maya Deities He is both male and female, and it is the union of this pair which brings about the birth, or sprouting, of the cultivated plants, which are said to be their offspring. . . . Ihp'en, as the passive spirit of maize, is said to be a single being and of male sex only. In this role he is the male consort of the female spirit of the beans, ixq'anan. (Wisdom 1940: 402; Dütting 1981: 205) The concept of a fantastic mythical being that in it- self unites the opposites earth-sky, life-death, male-female, etc., is characteristic for the variety of religions, and there is no reason to consider the Maya as an exception. This uniting was sometimes expressed in the idea of a dual ancestor deity (like the Central Mexican Ometeotl), or the pair of cre- ator gods (Mixtec 1 Flower and 13 Flower); and the trails of this relatively late concept are still kept in the notion of "mother-fathers" in contemporary Quiche communities (cf. Tedlock 1982: 52-53). The fantastic mythological being is also considered as a "supporter" of the universe, and, in Maya studies, is designated as Itzamná. Although some of his statements are no longer valid (like the one that "Itzam Na was primarily god of the hierarchy" [Thompson 1970: 210]), Eric Thompson, in his excellent study of this deity, has pointed (1970: 209-233) at its many different as- pects. The famous representations from Copán (Altar D), Palenque (House E), and Piedras Negras (Stela 25) were also designated as Terres- trial, Bicephallic, and Celestial Monster, respec- tively9, and these manifestations were summed up by Clemency Coggins (1985: 53-54): "As the reptilian structure of the universe, Itzamná en- compasses phenomena that transcended and are antithetical to the sun. It does, however, have dis- tinct celestial and Underworld components like the sun. . . . Supernatural beings often emerge from the open jaws of the celestial serpent and its body may consist of a Sky Band, a sequence of celestial signs. This serpent is also commonly represented as the 'serpent bar' carried by many Maya lords in their official portraiture, showing that the lord and his lineage worship and many descend from It- zamná. Beneath the human realm, Itzamná sym- bolized the structure of the earth, and in the waters of the earth and Underworld, where death reigns, it takes the skeletal forms of such aquatic reptiles as crocodiles. These are usually portrayed as Long Nose Heads, either skeletal or with no lower jaw (which means the same thing)." But it is not only Itzamná that is involved with the different aspects; many Maya deities are found in pairs (Maize Twins, hero-twins, the Paddlers from the Under- world, Hun Chuen and Hun Batz, etc.), a thing not very common for non- American traditions. Fig. 3: Bicephallic Monster. Altar D, Copán. On the more abstract level, there is ch'ab (in Yucatec: creation) and akab (darkness, night). The first is connected with sky and male; the other with earth and female. In the "Ritual of the Ba- cabs" their union is designated with the word al (birth). At this point it would be very interesting to point at the symbolism of the day Akbal (in other dialects also: Akabal, Uotan, Watan) - whose Yu- catec equivalent is akab. It is associated with night, interior of the earth, caves (Thompson 1950: 73-75), and also a jaguar (God L according to Schellhas' classification) as Lord of the Night. Ac- cording to Tzeltal Maya belief, the same day ( Uo- tan) represents the name of their ancestor, that came probably from the east, distributed land among the people, and introduced the art of hi- eroglyphic writing- the same thing attributed to It- zamná. Moreover, earlier authorities (Brinton, Se- ler) supposed that Uotan is a deity analogous to the "Heart of the Sky" from the "Popol Vuh" (cf. Thompson ibid.). This complex is derived mostly 9 Although Baudez et Becquelin (1984: 394-396) take into ac- count only the first two, and treat them as separate dei- ties. Anthropos 84.1989</page><page sequence="8">210 Aleksandar BoSkovié from the 16th century sources and has many paral- lels with the myths of the Quetzalcóatl. In this spe- cific mythic history ancient gods (obviously be- longing to the variety of biologically impossible su- pernatural beings) are being "transformed" in what is generally called "culture heros," leaving their primary associations obscured in the past. Besides this duality and its manifestations, it seems that we can talk of the two basic groups of the relevant mythological material. The "Popol Vuh" complex forms only one part of the so-called "Ceramic Codex," but there are many episodes whose ultimate meaning remains unknown. One example is suggested by Fig. 4: Apparently clear, the vase presents images of a deer and a frog. But the frog is also known as Uinal Monster, patron of the month (uinal). In the new edition of "Chilam Balam of Chumayel" there is a beautiful version of a myth named "The Birth of the Uinal," but on the conceptual scale, this also presents the birth of a mankind (Edmonson 1986: 30-31; 120-126). It is the woman that comes first, and I propose that here we encounter the Maya goddess of birth, Ix- chel. The evidence for this comes from the same vessel: the deer (animal almost exclusively asso- ciated with the moon goddess) has human eyes on its ears, which suggest his supernatural character (possibly, in connection with death and the Under- world). On the vessel designated by Robicsek and Hales with number 15, there is a curious scene which includes three persons with characteristic el- ements of glyph Caban and the moon goddess (lock of hair); and also two girls with deers (cf. Ro- bicsek and Hales 1981: 110-111). This vessel was put in the same "Codex Fragment" as the ones that present a love affair of wanton Dragon Lady with the old god. Taking into account not only vessel 15, but also the numerous double ceramic figurines showing the moon goddess and the old god, I pre- fer to call this lady Ixchel. Furthermore, on these vessels she is associated with the Bearded Dragon - and, please, note the beard of our Uinal Mon- ster. Fig. 4: Vase in private collection; height 14 cm, diameter 12 cm. Drawing after Justin Kerr's photograph published in Ro- bicsek and Hales 1981: vessel 43. But of the majority of episodes from ceramics we know almost nothing. The interpretations that considered everything as some episode from the "Popol Vuh" did not lead us too far, and the num- ber of scholars attempting with other approaches increases. The great progress made in the deci- pherment of Maya hieroglyphs might increase our knowledge - but it still does not mean that we will automatically be able to understand their myths. As was already mentioned above, we need sources. Even without them, it seems that there must have been another corpus of myths: since the Maya believed that in some sense everything was divine (including rivers, trees, stones, etc.) and had to be treated in the way that would ensure manifestation of only the benevolent side of the object or thing, there were probably tales about the encounters of the young men with the different "sacred" things, about the wanderings of men and/or women far away from home, etc. We can only hope that new achievements will bring forth the data about this other corpus. A very important feature of the Maya deities is that we cannot speak of a hierarchy among them (or even of a "pantheon" in the strict sense). Un- doubtfully , the roles of some were considered to be of special relevance for the specific activities (be- sides the examples already mentioned, the Jester God is always associated with the ruler; Xtabai with hunting, etc.), although, being essentially du- al, they could belong both to the Underworld and Overwork! (as designated by "mirror" signs on their bodies). Some were associated with particu- lar sites (the Palenque Triad; Water-Lily Jaguar with Tikal), where they were represented more of- ten and possibly were (especially those in animal forms) venerated as ancestors of the ruling dynas- ties. Only very few were represented in the human form, and although humans occasionally wore masks of the particular deities, the difference was always made clear. Whether Maya deities were actually "orga- nized" as to belong to different "complexes" (as seem to be the case with Aztecs) remains un- known; as well as the extent to which they accepted deities and cults of other Mesoamerican cultures. Some, like the Teotihuacán Rain God in the Clas- sic period and the Toltec Quetzalcóatl in the Post- classic, they did - but since they did not have a strong, united state, the "taking over" of "foreign" deities was not necessary. These are only some of the characteristics of Maya deities; the choice is arbitrary and there is still much more to say and explore.
