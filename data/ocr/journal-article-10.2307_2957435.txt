<plain_text><page sequence="1">214 MODERN PHILOSOPHY AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY To a great many people who are not professionally concerned with it modern philosophy (at any rate of the British and American varieties) seems a disappointing business. Philosophers seem to have lost themselves in sterile word-spinning, having little or no connection with those problems of religion, morals or practical life upon which philosophy was traditionally supposed to shed light. In fact, however, there are some achievements of modern logical analysis which can be of immense importance to theologians. For example, one of the most valuable lessons it has taught us is that when puzzles and paradoxes arise it is usually because the attempt is being made to say things in the wrong way-more concretely, because we have not properly understood what sort of thing we are talking about. The purpose of this article is to suggest that the difficulties that are notoriously associated with the attempt to understand the distinctively Christian doctrine of God, the doctrine of the Trinity, are of this kind. It appears to many people to be a puzzle and a paradox invented by theologians to make life difficult for ordinary folk, but that is because nearly all of us-theologians, laymen and unbelievers alike-tend to think about God in the wrong way : we mis- understand the sort of thing the word ' God ' is meant to denote. TRUE AND FALSE RELIGION Of course, in the case of anything like religious belief an error of this sort could not be just an intellectual mistake. Indeed, it is doubtful if any important logical confusion is ever just intellectual: failure to push its enquiries on beyond logic is probably modern philosophy's real weakness. Theologians and philosophers alike could learn a lesson here from another source, namely, the Marxists. Rejection of Marxist political doctrine should not make us ignore the very important philosophical principle of the unity of theory and practice-particularly if we are Christians, for it was a Christian principle long before Marx stated it. (' He that doeth the will shall know the doctrine '.) The logical structure of language is not something unrelated to practical life: rather it is a reflection of our attitudes to practical life, as indeed Wittgenstein seems to have realised in his Philosophical Investiga- tions. When, for instance, Professor Gilbert Ryle brings out the logical difficulties of the concept of mind as a sort of ' ghost in the machine ' he is really exposing something far deeper than a mere mistake on the part of Descartes. ' The Cartesian faux-pas ', as he calls it, is in fact an expression, a symptom, of a very practical disease of our civilisation, namely its tendency to identify essential humanity with mental activity and to despise the</page><page sequence="2">THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 215 body and physical activity. Strict Marxists would interpret this in terms of the exaltation of the leisured classes and the degradation of workers to mere machines. Freudians, on the other hand, would probably come nearer the truth by seeing it as a matter of neurotic fear of the body, of which the class-problem is itself only a symptom. But the important thing is that it is a practical, emotional dilemma which bedevils our thinking with para- doxes by making us conceive the mind as a sort of thing which it is really not. Similarly, if we think about the basic religious concept, the concept of God, in the wrong sort of way then it is because something has gone wrong with our religion at the practical and emotional level, the level of worship and life. It is therefore no coincidence, to my mind, that the doctrine of the Trinity tends to be regarded as an unnecessary mystification just at the time in history when Christianity is obviously almost completely lacking in vitality. The truth is that for the most part we, Christians as well as non-Christians, have lost our understanding of what Christianity is. Now if we study the history of religion carefully we find that this fate overtakes every faith from time to time. Doctrines and ceremonial observ- ances are retained practically unaltered, yet by some curious process they seem to change their meaning, in the practical sense, completely, with the result that the religion in question becomes at best lifeless and at worst the very opposite of everything it originally stood for. This is the real burden of the prophetic denunciation of 'false religion ', which modern theologians and social historians tend to misunderstand altogether. They tend to treat it as a piece of bigoted sectarian exclusiveness, ignoring the fact that it is often not 'someone else's religion' which the prophet de- nounces in these terms, but something he regards as ersatz in his own religious tradition-and the prophets of all the great faiths are alike in this. We have not even begun to understand religion or religious belief until we recog- nise that it is never, in any age, a single social phenomenon defined by certain doctrines, but always an intensely dialectical phenomenon, a continual struggle within various social institutions and doctrinal formulae between those who understand their real purpose and those who, wittingly or un- wittingly, have corrupted them from that purpose into something quite different. The transformation of what R. R. Marett calls 'pre-animistic religion' into animism in primitive times was probably a manifestation of this corruption. And Christianity is certainly no exception to the rule, as Jesus himself foresaw when he warned his followers that their greatest danger would come from Satan appearing as an angel of light. In relatively modern times there have been many prophets in the Christian churches who have accused their even-Christians of just this error. Kierkegaard said that Europeans had 'driven Christianity out of Christendom without being quite aware of it'. Blake, our own English prophet, was more violent, more like the prophets of Israel; the Christians of his day, he said, were 'worshipping Satan under the name of God'. In our own day Hugh Ross Williamson, in his remarkable little book A.D. 33, has described the con.</page><page sequence="3">216 JOHN WREN-LEWIS temporary churches as alliances of those very social and psychological forces which brought about the crucifixion of Christ-the political expediency of Pilate, the ecclesiastical conservatism of Caiaphas, the mystical nation- alism of Barabbas, and the business ability of Judas Iscariot. The accusation may seem exaggerated, but no-one who applies Jesus' own acid test, 'By their fruits ye shall know them ', can honestly deny that something has gone very wrong with Christianity. By our fruits we have clearly lost most, if not all, our contact with the religion of the New Testa- ment-and the contact we retain might almost be said to be in spite of rather than through our religious observance, since many people outside the churches appear, by their fruits, to have it in quite equal measure. Consequently Christians can hardly afford to ignore Blake's contention that 'if they have not the religion of Jesus they will have the religion of Satan and erect the synagogue of Satan, calling the Prince of this world, God'. After all, Jesus himself said 'He that is not with us is against us '. Nor is it so fantastic as it may sound to diagnose this sort of unwitting apostasy by examining the difficulties our expositors have in making sense of the doctrine of the Trinity. The very fact that such a suggestion sounds fantastic to us, the very fact that we tend to feel puzzled at the intensity of the disputes over the doctrine in the early Christian centuries, these are themselves symptoms of the disease. For in fact the doctrine was formulated precisely in order to guard against heresy as far as possible, and the real meaning of heresy, which again we do not really understand nowadays, is precisely falsification of belief by changing the meaning of doctrines from within. The protection which the doctrine of the Trinity was intended to afford does not lie so much in the positive statements made about God in, for example, the so-called Athanasian Creed-these have another purpose, as I shall show-but rather in the very thing to which I am calling attention, namely, the logical form of those statements. Theology, as Wittgenstein so penetratingly observes, is a sort of grammar. All positive statements are capable of being twisted in meaning from within, and many modern Christians who cling to the doctrine of the Trinity with fanatical orthodoxy, defying their 'modernist ' brethren who are less sure about it, show by their fruits that they are just as lacking in real Christianity as any modernists, thereby proving that the positive statements of the doctrine of the Trinity have been misinterpreted. But the logical form of the doctrine, the form created by the positive statements taken all together, is such as to be applic- able to the sort of thing the word 'God ' really means and not to any other sort of thing, and since it is just here, in the total form of the doctrine, that our difficulties of understanding occur, then the diagnosis that we have only an ersatz Christianity is inescapable. THE LIFE BEHIND THE LOGIC When a fundamental doubt like this arises in any field it is always best to go back to first principles and try to understand the whole matter afresh,</page><page sequence="4">THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 217 right from the ground up. But what are the first principles in this case ? It is just here that most of our attempts to expound or elucidate the meaning of Christian doctrines go wrong, right at the starting-point. The usual thing is to start with some sort of argument to establish the existence of God, and the meaning that is implicitly given to the word ' God ' in the majority of such arguments is 'the being who creates and controls the Universe '. Inevitably, the image rises in the mind of an ' old man above the sky', but we promptly try to remove the obvious absurdity of such a picture by saying that of course human thought cannot possibly hope to do justice to a being who is infinite. Now this, as Wittgenstein and others have shown in other contexts, is a very dangerous procedure. It is much better to face the picture that arises in the mind when a philosophical argument is used, for whether we like it or not it conditions the real meaning we shall give to the words we use later on. And there can be no denying that in this case it certainly does so. We proceed to talk about the will of God, God's commandments, God's self-revelations, God's interventions in human affairs, in language which shows quite clearly that this sort of picture of an Almighty Individual somehow 'above ' or 'outside ' the total system of the space-time universe, is at the back of our minds. And of course it is just here that the difficulties about the doctrine of the Trinity arise. We reject instinctively the notion that all the doctrine means to do is substi- tute for the one old man above the sky a committee of three (as a Japanese student is supposed to have said) with power to co-opt-or, if not instinct- ively, we reject it in the face of assertions to the effect that there are not three Gods but one God. Equally we are prevented from saying that the three 'persons ' of the doctrine are really only three masks worn by the one God for different occasions, since the Church specifically rejected that view when Sabellius put it forward. But what then can the doctrine possibly mean ? We are forced to resort to sophistications about 'the three aspects of Creative Mind', such as Miss Dorothy Sayers uses in The Mind of the Maker, or about 'multi-dimensional personality', such as Mr. C. S. Lewis uses in Beyond Personality, and we lard them plentifully with more pro- testations about the inadequacy of human language for describing the infinite. These are just the kinds of thing that ought to make us suspicious -and of course they never really convince. The majority of people are simply left asking 'So what ? ' What has gone wrong ? Obviously the nigger in the woodpile is the image of an Almighty Individual-for surely what the logical form of the doctrine of the Trinity does is precisely to make it impossible to imagine God as that sort of being. But this sort of picture is bound to arise when we talk about the creator and controller of the Universe, so that our error must lie in starting at that point. And, of course, as soon as we come to think about it the inadequacy of such a starting-point is surely obvious, or at any rate there are a whole host of things that ought to make us suspect it. For one thing, anthropologists have now shown that the common idea that religion</page><page sequence="5">218 JOHN WREN-LEWIS originates from speculation about the causes of natural events is completely false: the real origin of religious belief lies behind all primitive philosophy of this sort, and even, as I have said, behind animism-these things are later developments, and may even be regarded as to some extent degrada- tions, of religion. Biblical critics have underlined this by showing that the cosmological assertions of the Book of Genesis were never meant to be in any sense definitions of the word 'God '-they were assertions about a Being already well known from quite a different context. Again, and perhaps more important, the image of an Almighty Individual controlling and ruling the world and all the people in it is based on analogy with our own ordinary picture of ourselves controlling and using our environment, but all religions, and the Hebrew-Christian religion in particular, proclaim as a fundamental part of their message that there is something very wrong with our ordinary imagination of ourselves and the way of living that corres- ponds to it. The work of certain modern Hebrew scholars, notably Professor Martin Buber, enables us to put this point more specifically : one thing that is quite certain about the religion of Israel is that it condemns our habit of thinking of ourselves primarily as individuals controlling and using things. If there is one aspect of our experience from which we ought not to draw analogies of God's creative activity, therefore, it is surely this aspect. Equally, it is a fundamental tenet of all religions that there is some- thing very wrong with our ordinary imagination of the world, and the dis- coveries of modern science lend powerful support to this. We ought there- fore to beware of any picture that springs to the mind when we think of a creator of the Universe, for we have almost certainly got a quite false notion of the Universe in mind. When once we have begun to think along these lines it is not difficult to see what ought to be the real starting-point for our effort of understanding. The place where religion always arises, in practice, from primitive times until the present day, is in the relations of human beings with one another : this is shown by anthropologists, Biblical critics and psychologists alike. Equally, when we make a real effort to think straight about what we really know of the Universe, and stop confusing this with the various abstract pictures we build up of the Universe for the purpose of working out the details of utilitarian objectives, we are forced back to the conclusion that the 'all' in which we live and move and have our being is always known first and foremost as a system of relationships with people. Matter and space and time are all known as aspects of our intercourse with one another. In order to solve our practical material problems we have to abstract from this primary knowledge and construct models in which people are seen as inside a Universe which is a system of stars or atoms spread out in space and time, but to think of these imaginary models as having superior reality to the Universe of personal relations which we actually know in experience is to cut off the branch we sit on. As Professor Herbert Dingle has said, 'It is impossible that experience should be refuted by deductions from</page><page sequence="6">THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 219 experience'. The reason why we do commit this error is precisely that in practice we pay more attention to our use of our material environment (including the people in it, for when you use a person you reduce him to the status of 'material') than we do to personal relationships, which is just the thing which religion maintains is wrong with human life. The primary purpose of religion is to liberate us from error and show us the truth, and the truth about the Universe we live in is that it is primarily a personal universe : distances and periods of time and atoms and stars are aspects of reality that is always known in personal terms-that is why in dreams, when our consciousness is relaxed from organising our knowledge into utilitarian patterns, objects from the material world are found by psycho- analysts to symbolise the deep personal relationship-problems of our lives. So that when we want to understand what religion means by talking about a God, a Creator, we must look at the realm of personal relations, as Buber has said-and if we look at what religion says about personal relations at the practical level the meaning at once becomes clear. (' He that doeth the will . . .'). For, as we have said, religion finds man's practical error in his setting himself over against his environment and trying to use it, as an individual: what he ought to do, if he wants to have life and have it more abundantly is-the verdict is unequivocal-to open himself in sym- pathy and enter into relationships of love with his fellows. 'He that saveth his life shall lose it', said Jesus. 'Without love I am nothing ', said St. Paul. This must surely mean, if we take it seriously, that the relationship of love is something more than an association of individuals, is indeed a creative power not dependent for its existence on persons, but upon which, on the contrary, persons as persons depend for their existence. The sug- gestion sounds at first absurd-as absurd as the notion of an old man above the sky, it might be thought-but in fact it is merely shocking to our individ- ualistic presuppositions. It is actually in complete accord with the unanimous testimony of friends and lovers, as is shown by their use of phrases like ' falling in love ', 'this thing is bigger than both of us ', or 'love will always find a way'. It is absurd only in the sense in which lovers are thought by worldly-wise people to be foolish, and what religion proclaims is precisely that the foolishness of lovers is wiser than men. St. John was speaking quite literally when he said 'God is love ', and so were the ancient rabbis when they said that the shekinah, the glory of God, lies between husband and wife in marriage. In this context the logical form of the doctrine of the Trinity is perfectly appropriate, for it is precisely a social or relational form. 'That Love could love and be loved, that was a great discovery-say a revelation ', said Charles Williams, and the doctrine of the Trinity is an expression and an elaboration of that discovery. This is not to deny that religion does make the assertion that God is the creator and controller of the material world-the Hebrew- Christian religious tradition certainly does, and moreover its scholars have from time to time explicitly repudiated those strains of Eastern religion</page><page sequence="7">220 JOHN WREN-LEWIS which tend to doubt it. What I am saying is that religious belief never starts from there, any more than Jewish religious belief started with the assertions of the Book of Genesis, and we go grievously wrong, for the reasons I have indicated, if we try to make our understanding of religion start from there. The great doctors of the early Church knew this very well : God, they said, could not be understood in the light of the world-rather the world must be understood in the light of God. Because our ordinary idea of the world is false, any notion of a Creator we may infer from it is bound to give us just what we have described as false religion, namely an understanding of religion which has completely lost the revolutionary impact of the genuine article because it is based upon the very error religion exists to correct. The real religious view of the creation of the material world is one which demands a revolution in our understanding of what the material world itself is. It is the view that the creator and controller of all matter and all space and time is precisely That which is between man and man in personal relationship. The relevance of such a view to our under- standing of the queer things that appear to happen to space and time in so-called telepathic communication between people is obvious: it is also very important for our understanding of the so-called psycho-somatic factors in physical health, whereby a person's relationships with others can affect profoundly the material happenings in his body. But it is obviously utterly different from what is usually imagined to be the common-sense view of God's dominion over the Universe, according to which God is seen as something between a Great Conjurer producing the world-rabbit out of thin air, a Great Foreman supervising the running of the world-machine, and a Great Gardener carefully breeding and cultivating the human plant through the ages of the universal garden. Perhaps the most significant difference is that 'the age-old Problem of Evil arises in quite a different form. In the 'common-sense ' picture it is very hard indeed to see why the Creator, if He is anything like the Bible says, should ever allow the physical calamities that take place all the time in the material world, and the sophistications that are invoked to 'justify the ways of God to men' are about as unconvincing as the Trinitarian speculations. On the real religious view, however, there is no such puzzle, for if it is literally Love that controls the material order then the fact that human beings almost universally fail to live by love might be expected to have considerable material repercussions, often in directions which at the moment we cannot understand. The problem of evil is therefore simply that of why human beings do use their freedom of choice to become enemies of love : it concerns human, not divine behaviour. A whole host of common perplexities about religion are cleared up when it is recognised that the word 'God ' refers to a sort of Relationship rather than to a sort of Individual. Words like Omnipresent, Omniscient, Transcendent, Unconditioned and so on take on quite different meanings, meanings which, it should be noted, no longer come under the familiar</page><page sequence="8">THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 221 'logical positivist' stricture of being unverifiable, since they are based on experience, not on abstract argument. The ' creation ' to which real religion refers is a real experienced process, not an hypothesis based on inference, and the doctrine of divine transcendence is simply an expression of the character of this creation-process, that is to say, of the fact that it is an encounter with a reality of Relationship which exists before we encounter it and is never exhausted by our participation in it. The doctrine of God's omnipresence expresses the fact that we are never separated from our relationships wherever we go-we separate ourselves from Love not by isolating ourselves but rather by taking up impersonal attitudes to people, attitudes of possessiveness or compulsion. Omniscience means, in the first place at any rate, that we can have no secrets from Love even when we do cut ourselves off, since love penetrates to the very depths of our being and apart from it no self exists. The doctrine that God is unconditioned Being is a very practical warning that any relationship which depends upon imposed conditions is not fully personal, is not of God, and consequently has no life in it. Many other examples could be given of the way in which familiar theological statements ' come alive' when their true reference is understood, but there is space here for only one more, one which is of special relevance to my main theme. The doctrine of divine unity, the proclamation 'The Lord thy God is One', is not concerned with replacing the many controlling spirits of animism by one master-spirit, as is usually assumed by both learned and popular historians of religion. On the contrary, ani- mistic belief in many controllers and the more sophisticated belief in one universal controller are both distortions of religion, and are psychologically of the same order, in that they alike concentrate on the material aspect of the world and the I-it aspect of personality. What the doctrine really declares is the great truth that the reality of Relationship is always the same, wherever and with whoever we enter it. The corollary, 'Thou shalt have none other Gods but me ', precisely forbids the endowment of the mater- ial order as such with 'spirituality', and the second of the Ten Command- ments, 'Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image' underlines unmistakably the fact that the one Old Man above the Sky is not simply a 'childish approximation' but a radically false idea of God. (The com- mentaries of the Rabbis show that this Commandment was never meant to refer only to images of wood and stone, but included anthropomorphic mental images as well). THE TRINITARIAN DESIGN FOR LIVING Perhaps the biggest and most significant difference which this return to first principles makes to our understanding of religion is in the realm of religious practice, and it is necessary to say something about this by way of conclusion in order to give some concrete context to what has been said so far, although such discussion falls into the category of theology and morals rather than philosophy. The most important thing is that the whole ' second</page><page sequence="9">222 JOHN WREN -LEWIS hand' character of religious ethics and ceremonial, which makes so many ordinary people today echo, in a less articulate way, the logical positivists' judgement that it is all meaningless, disappears. The ' commandments ' of God no longer appear to be arbitrary rules of life which God has decreed, nor can they be written off as elementary laws of social conduct backed up with the threat of supernatural authority. They are quite literally the principles of life, in the sense that they describe conditions in which we either do or do not encounter Love, the only Source of life. We are not told to love our neighbours because God says we ought to and will punish us if we do not, but rather because it is only by finding love-relationship that we can be persons at all: we are fully alive and fully ourselves when we are open in heart and mind to That which is between man and man, and to love God in this way is to love one's neighbour as oneself, while to fail to do it is to become a featureless unit, imprisoned in one's own self-con- sciousness, which is a fate for which the term 'hell' is no exaggeration. Of course, one cannot love to order, and this has led a great many exponents of modern 'Christianity' to say that the love which God commands is not ordinary love at all, but a cold, deliberate 'acting towards the other person as if you loved him '. Here false religion ceases to be harmless nonsense and shows its diabolical aspect : there could be no more deadly advice, as modern psychology shows-the result will be that the loving actions will themselves become vehicles of a subtle, venomous hatred. A fundamental lack of belief is clearly revealed here, a lack of any belief in Love as a real power, a lack of any feeling of God in human life. Jesus could command people to love precisely because he did believe in and know Love as a real power, a power which can live in us even as we live in it, if only we will open ourselves to it, become sensitive to it. The command to love means, practically, 'Become sensitive', and that is essentially what all religious ceremonials are, disciplines of sensitiveness. Prayer and ritual are, again, not duties undertaken because God says they ought to be, but practical methods of sensitising the psyche and the soma respectively to the needs of others, or, more accurately, to the promptings of Love towards others. It is in terms of these intensely practical issues that we have to understand the various positive statements made in the doctrine of the Trinity, of which of course the word Trinity itself (as implying a specific assertion of threefold- ness rather than just a logical assertion of a relational character) is one. I have said that the doctrine is an elaboration of the basic religious conviction 'that Love can love and be loved ', and it will not take much reflection to show that such elaboration is of the utmost' practical importance as soon as we set ourselves the task of growing into love, 'that we might have life, and have it more abundantly '. There are all sorts of possibilities of error and self-deception about love; it might even be said, in the very opposite sense to Jesus's meaning, that the term 'love ' in our world is used to cover a multitude of sins, a multitude of offences against Love. Just as we can worship Satan under the name of God, so we can use other people, or impose</page><page sequence="10">THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 223 demands for functional conformity upon them, in the name of Love. All doctrines about the nature of God, and the Trinitarian formulae in particular, help us to guard against this by telling us more precisely what sort of a rela- tionship Love is. I have already given one example of this in the case of the doctrine that God is unconditioned. I want to conclude by elucidating in the same way some of the doctrines of the ' Athanasian ' Creed. Love, this formula tells us, is a threefold relationship of equals, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We can begin to understand this if we translate it roughly as 'a threefold unity of giving, acceptance and interpretation (or overflowing)'. That love involves giving few people would doubt, but spasmodic acts of giving are not in themselves love. Love rather involves a sustained general attitude of giving to the other person, an attitude for which Fatherhood is an appropriate term, since human biological fatherhood is a reflexion of it in form and at its best an actual instance of it. If love has not this general attitude then it is not love; yet by itself even this is not love, but only patronising benevolence. In real love there is also accept- ance, in equal measure with giving. Again, however, acceptance does not mean simply taking what the other person gives (although that may be something we are tempted to avoid if our pride is involved): it means accepting the other person in himself and for himself, allowing him to be himself and to be it in relation to me, with all the consequences-suffering, in fact, in the full sense of the word. Without such a general attitude of acceptance, for which the name Sonship is appropriate, there is no love, and Jesus, who according to Christianity was the perfect embodiment of the divine life, was most especially the incarnation of God's Sonship, since his mission was above all one of acceptance : he suffered those who knew Relationship with him to be themselves, even to the point of betrayal at the hands of one of them, and by so doing overcame the fallen world's rejection of love. Yet give-and-take is still not, in itself, love. There is still the Third Person to be considered, and in human terms there are numerous 'third persons '. The temptation to be exclusive in love is perhaps the most dcadly of all. So rarely, indeed, is it avoided that Freud, whose insight told him that love is the fundamental life-force in spite of his conscious rejection of religion, decided that love must be exclusive of its very nature, so that wider social relations must be based on fear of the opposite of the life-force, aggression. Against this Christianity affirms that the essence of love is inclusive, that openness to real Love leads every pair of friends or lovers to go out beyond themselves and include more and more third persons in their relationships just as the descent of the Holy Spirit in power on the day of pentecost drove the group of friends of Jesus to 'go into all the world' and strive to bring all nations into their relationship. Exclusiveness, Chris- tianity asserts, is a denial of an essential activity of Love and therefore of Love itself, for there are not three Gods but one God : and it is because this denial takes place, all over the world, that agressive forces are generated in</page><page sequence="11">224 JOHN WREN-LEWIS people. That is why fallen human society is based on fear, as Freud saw, but in a society that is really human, and not made inhuman by denial of Love, social relations will be 'rooted and grounded in love'. 'In this Trinity', says the Quicunque Vult, 'none is afore and none is after another, none is greater and none is less than another '. If the giver holds himself superior because of his giving then he is not really giving, and if the friends who extend their friendship to others continue to give each other prior loyalty (instead of giving loyalty always and only to That which is between) then their interpretation is not real interpretation. Here too is a practical safeguard against self-deception of immense importance, and its implications for the wider organisation of social relations is revolu- tionary beyond anything the Marxists have proclaimed. Similarly 'the Father is uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated': love, in all its motions, is spontaneous, so that the attempt to make ourselves love for any ulterior motive, even a good motive, is to deny Love, as I have already insisted. 'The Father is infinite, the Son infinite, and the Holy Ghost infinite '; love that is limited, which will go so far but no farther, is not love. 'The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal': love is not love that alters when it alteration finds. So, and in many other instances which I have no space to explore, the Fathers of the Church worked out the implications of the revelation of Love which Jesus brought in his own life and Person. The resulting doctrine is no abstract theologians' puzzle but a practical and concrete design for living. JOHN WREN-LEWIS London.</page></plain_text>
