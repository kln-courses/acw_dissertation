<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shadow of Childhood: Neoteny and the Biology of Religion. Weston La Barre. Nor- man: University of Oklahoma Press, 1991. 190 pp. $18.95 (cloth). BARBARA W. LEX Harvard Medical School This book consists of three essays from the De Vos Lectures in Psychoanalytic Anthro- pology. It is best read in tandem with The Hu- man Animal (La Barre, University of Chicago Press, 1954). "The shadow of childhood" re- fers to retention of neotenous traits in Homo sapiens. La Barre ranges widely across ge- netics, physics, astronomy, neurophysiology, psychoanalytic psychiatry, behavioral biol- ogy, prehistory, and history of religion. The tone is Eurocentric, with an implicitly value- free science proposed as the vehicle for contin- uing human evolution. Two appendixes dis- cuss extraterrestrial intelligence. Chapter 1 is entitled "Neoteny, Human Trimorphism, and Crisis Cults." "Trimor- phism" manifests itself in the slow maturation and dependence of the infant; the permanent breast, reservoir of adipose tissue, and wider pelvis of the adult female; and the larger lung capacity, greater metabolic rate, and spurts of exertion of the adult male. Food sharing emerges from these biological factors as the economic basis of marriage, and specialization for hunting as the foundation for magic and re- ligion. Culture is a "group defense mechanism," and "archosis' '-culturally syntonic misap- prehensions about people or things-is anal- ogous to neurosis or psychosis (p. 45). These latter terms are borrowed from psychoanalytic psychiatry as practiced almost two decades past. Another provocative assertion suggests that since 95% of the human genome is non- functional "junk," much of culture is "gar- bage" (p. 42). Interestingly, "cultural preju- dice" is deemed a lethal trait. However, few societies lack this attitude and associated be- haviors, from preferred marriages to diplo- macy. If xenophobia is so widespread, could it be "wired into" the human nervous system? In chapter 2, "Neoteny, Animism, and the Improbability of Life," a review of factors nec- essary for emergence of life and evolution of Homo sapiens concludes in "awe" (p. 95). Ar- chosis results from parental care of the depen- dent child (p. 54). Yet, where is the role of other kin or social groups in enculturation, in- cluding guidance through rites of passage? Further, animism is the "illegitimate projec- tion" of consciousness and personhood onto mere things, and is "probably the most haz- ardous error that human beings can make" (p. 57). With magic individuals feel omnipotent, a neotenous trait whereby the infant does not differentiate itself from others, while religion views the world in anthropomorphic terms, whereby characteristics of deities derive from roles in the trimorphic nuclear family (p. 96). Chapter 3, "Neoteny, Magic, and Reli- gion," elaborates earlier themes. Adults as- sume "the loving and protective human envi- ronment that surrounded them in childhood" should be available to palliate stress (p. 103). La Barre chooses Freud over Durkheim by lo- cating the genesis of religious attitudes and be- haviors from dynamics within the nuclear family, and tells us that Freud deemed religion "a piece of infantilism which only a few are ca- pable of overcoming" (p. 105). Thus, magic and religion are merely differ- ent stages of neoteny. Crisis cults, therefore, also stem from this source. "The [crisis] cult is the would-be therapy of the traumatized culture" (p. 146), the solution to human prob- lems that emanate from childhood yearnings. The "Heavenly Father" is omnipotent (and "Mother Nature" personifies the environ- ment). But, tensions prevail between helpless individuals and unassailable authority fig- ures. For case material La Barre laments the political and environmental consequences of neoteny in the self-serving acts of U.S. presi- dents as father figures, and the American preoccupation with leisure and idolization of entertainers that derives from childhood play- fulness. One major concern is that "neoteny" is treated as homogeneous, and not examined in conjunction with temperamental differences or associated with psychological disorders as they are currently defined. Nonetheless, this book has utility for biological anthropology and for coursework on anthropological theo- ries of the supernatural, magic, and religion.</page></plain_text>
