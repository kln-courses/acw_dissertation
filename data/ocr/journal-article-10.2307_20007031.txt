<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, Vol. 5, No. 1, 1991 The Moral Elevation of Animals: The Case of "Gorillas in the Mist" Jeffrey E. Nash and Anne Sutherland All cultures provide their members with ways to understand differ? ences between animals and humans and with ideas of appropriate "human" or "animal" behavior. Conceptions of animals in pre-modern societies are part of an integral conceptual system where there is considerable agree? ment about world view and ethos. For example, the Balinese characterize animals as hairy beings who walk on four legs and have sharp teeth. Hu? mans must separate themselves from any animal-like behavior. They must be hairless, walk on two legs and have flat teeth. To keep a clear separation between human and animal, the Balinese do not allow babies to crawl, file their teeth flat at puberty and view hairy people (e.g. Europeans) as ani? mal-like demons. In modern technological societies, however, these conceptual systems lose their integrity and become a complexly interwoven proliferation of cul? tural beliefs about humans and animals (cf. Berger 1979, Levy 1972). For example, in modern America, there are a variety of belief systems which people can use to address human/animal distinctiveness. Human/animal re? lationships assume variegated forms ranging from animals as "family" mem? bers ("children in fur coats"), animals as property, or for human consumption to idealized beings in need of protection. Under the condition of modernity, the semantics of everyday life (those systems of meanings people use to interpret their participation in society) become highly multifaceted and multi-vocal (Frank 1987). Con? trasted with traditional culture, where the range of answers to fundamental questions is less diverse, in contemporary society there is no single system to impart consistent meaning to the daily actions of everyone (Swidler, 1986). With regard to distinctions between animals and humans, we might expect mutifaceted and multi-vocal expressions as indicators of ideological competition for meaning. For example, Kellert (1978, 1988) surveyed a ill ? 1991 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">112 Nash and Sutherland sample of American adults and discovered ten dimensions of meaning in people's attitudes toward animals. These range from concern for environ? ment and management of wildlife populations, through attitudes which stress animals in terms of human values and uses, to dominionistic and negativistic attitudes toward animals.1 Kellert and others (Wewer 1990) suggest that each attitude cluster has a characteristic profile, with ecological and moralistic groupings composed mostly of young relatively well educated urbanit?s, or, as in the case of moralistic meanings, young white females working in health care, teaching school, or working for the government. Interestingly, those who are most likely to be concerned about the right and wrong treatment of animals, and who are most strongly opposed to exploitation and cruelty to animals, live in large cities, mostly in the East, and have had relatively little experience with animals. Although ecological and moralistic sentiments may be found among twenty-seven percent of those in Kellert's sample, most Americans (nearly eighty percent) express pragmatic, naturalistic, humanistic or neutral attitudes about animals. These categories of Kellert's typology depict people who see animals in terms of their value to humans. His data suggest that a fairly remarkable array of answers can be expected from the question "What is the relation? ship between animals and humans?" People may disagree considerably on the meanings of eating animals (vegetarianism), about using them for ex? perimentation (anti-vivisectionism), and about the treatment of them in the close presence of humans (humaneness). Under such semantic conditions, the sharp distinction between human and animal can become ambiguous, and even problematic (Perin 1988). The traditional American view of hu? man/animal relationships ? that animals can be used to benefit humans has recently been challenged and redefined by the animals rights move? ment, environmentalists and conservation groups. These groups question the fundamental assumption of the superiority of humans over animals, and they are vocal in claiming a higher moral ground for their position. The homocentric assumption they attack has deep Biblical and philosophical roots in western culture. In Kant's categorical imperative, humans as a category always take precedence over animals as a category. And, the premise of Western philosophy that humans are rational ex? cludes animals from some fundamental questions. Also while there is con? siderable debate currently among theologians about the place of animals in theology, in the Christian tradition, animals have not been central to definitions of the essential meanings of being human. According to Lin zey, one nineteenth-century Jesuit wrote, "We have no duties of charity nor duties of any kind to the lower animals, as neither to sticks or stones" (Linzey 1989, 1). And, Saint Thomas Aquinas held that "By divine provi? dence, animals are intended for man's use in the natural order" and it</page><page sequence="3">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 113 is not wrong for man to make use of them either by killing or in any way whatever" (quoted in Linzey 1989, 22). Even though some theologi? ans like Linzey are interested in "correcting" this reading of Christianity, in Judeo-Christian tradition humans are given dominion over the earth and all things of the earth; and, in Western philosophy, only humans can exercise free will. Animals rights activists attempt to redefine these human-centered as? sumptions negatively, labeling them "specieism," (Singer 1975) which they believe to be the moral equivalent of racism and sexism. Members of the animals rights movement argue that biological difference should not be grounds for moral differences (just as biological differences between men and women do not justify the moral superiority of one over the other), and that the happiness of all "sentient beings" is the goal that culture should be seeking. While the meanings of human/animal relationships are now disput? able at the collective level, specific groups or categories of people have their opinions of the relationship. Hence, animal ideologists in the middle and upper-middle classes are apparently fascinated by media presenta? tions films and television programs that impute motives and emotions to animals. While we recognize that the version of the meanings of animals proposed by such media presentations are specific to their audiences, these programs and the materials they present often embody the essential categories of meaning that are being challenged and transformed in mod? ern society. A recent manifestation of the new animal ideology is the film "Go? rillas in the Mist". This film advocates a strong normative ideal of the relationship between Dian Fossey and creatures of the wild, and is com? mitted ideologically to the idea of the gorillias as morally pure in contrast to humans. We do not have information on the social and economic char? acteristics of the film's audience, but it is more than likely that these audiences do not include the upper and lower classes in America ? groups more likely to be closer to nature and animals than are the white collar, professional managerial university educated middle classes in America. In this paper, we analyze "Gorillas in the Mist" in order to identify the complex belief system that idealizes animals in general and the gorilla in particular. While such an explication does not locate the belief system in its complete sociological context, it does show the complex character of it, and moves us toward an understanding of the challenges it presents to core cultural values and of implications it has if it were to become a domi? nant ideology of everyday life.</page><page sequence="4">114 Nash and Sutherland THE FILM'S NARRATIVE In describing Fossey's work with the mountain gorillas, the film fo? cuses on three contemporary issues. The first is the position of animals in human culture. The film seeks to elevate that position and establish that the welfare of animals is of higher value than the welfare of humans be? cause society is morally corrupt and because nature is pure and innocent. The second theme is the evil of human society, both in the developed "first" world and the underdeveloped "third" world. According to the film, while these worlds are not equal, they are equally evil because they do not show respect for the gorilla. The third theme is the openness of sexual choices in modern society. Because human society is corrupted, sexuality for a woman dedicated to the moral elevation of animals forces her into the only pure solution available to her, rejecting a human lover in order to stay within the world of animals, in effect leaving the human world. THEMES AS IDEOLOGY "Gorillas in the Mist" addresses the moral relationships between hu? mans and animals in carefully selected visual images. Whenever gorillas appear in the film, they are portrayed as natural, pure, clean, loving, non? violent and innocent. They never once do anything cruel to each other or to humans. People, on the other hand, are depicted as destructive, violent, selfish, egotistical, dirty and disdainful, or at best oblivious to nature. The symbolic message is of nature (animals: gorillas) as morally pure and cul? ture (humans, both from developed and underdeveloped countries) as mor? ally corrupt. In this tragic encounter between nature and culture, only Dian Fossey stands out as a heroine. She is unselfishly dedicated to the gorillas. We see this first in the film when she convinces Professor Leakey to let her study the gorillas with her plea "I love animals," and her devotion to them as her primary qualification to do a census of gorillas. Next, to further establish her dedication, we are told that she has her appendix removed so it will not interfere with her field work. The film then establishes the purity of the animal world. When Dian falls into gorilla spoor she is elated, not sullied, because the presence of spoor is not seen as messy or dirty but as a sign that gorillas are nearby. When she spots the gorillas for the first time, she is frightened but realizes how foolish this is because gorillas cause no harm. In the scene in which she is able to watch them for the first time she becomes orgasmic in her ecstasy, heaving and breathing with difficulty at the emotion they produce in her.</page><page sequence="5">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 115 Gorillas are not the only animals that cause her to become ecstatic. In one dramatic moment she looks on a mother deer and her baby and effuses, "Beautiful, that's what it's all about," referring to the purpose of her life. Immediately, the deer dash away and we hear a terrible scream, only to discover that the baby deer has fallen into a trap set by the local people and has broken its back. Although her tracker tries to explain to her that people trap animals for food and have done so for generations, Dian Fossey is not interested in their survival or history. Tearfully she steels herself to shoot the baby animal to put it out of its misery, anguishing, "How could they do this?" The audience is given a very clear message: People are cruel; animals are good and innocent. The theme of cruelty and violence in human civilization is perhaps the most well developed in the film. Dian Fossey has extremely unsympa? thetic feelings towards the African country where she has come to study gorillas. In several scenes, the country is portrayed as dirty, chaotic, corrupt and violent (a civil war is going on), hopeless, superstitious and ignorant. For example, while she is driving through the countryside, the sound track consists of babies crying and women screaming, apropos of nothing. When Dian Fossey arrives in the country she notices signs of war and asks her patron, Dr. Leakey, what is going on. He replies in an off-hand manner, "I suppose it's some sort of civil war. Nothing to worry about". Her concern is gorillas not people so she brushes aside this war. But later it comes back to impinge on her work, and she is brutally evicted from the country by soldiers. Distressed at the interruption in her work, less so at the brutality of the soldiers, she decides to move her camp to Rwanda on the other side of the border, exclaiming, "Gorillas don't recognize borders". So, of course, why should she? She disregards political sovereignty, cultural rules, and religious tra? dition repeatedly throughout the film. For example, the minute she moves to Rwanda she encounters the religious beliefs of the local people there. Blundering into their cemetery, disturbing their graves, she incurs the wrath of a group of local men. Because she has allowed the souls of their dead to escape by disturbing the circle of stones around the graves the locals fear she is a witch who has come to harm them. They are very disturbed by her actions and threaten her with spears. Her reaction is to consider all this mumbo jumbo ridiculous and she laughs at such ignorant supersti? tions. They are ignorant, she civilized. From this moment on, she manipu? lates local custom and religion to achieve her goal, by learning enough about native beliefs in witchcraft to scare them away from her nature pre? serve. She encourages them to think of her as a witch and paints witch pictures of herself on entrances to the gorillas' territory.</page><page sequence="6">116 Nash and Sutherland The superstitious under developed world, of course, is part of a bigger picture that includes the developed world. Both are equally insensitive to the survival of animals. The underdeveloped and developed worlds meet in a climatic scene in the film which begins with a slaughter of gorillas by local people to capture one baby gorilla for a zoo. The massacre is horrible. Mother gorillas scream, fighting to defend their babies. The male gorilla bravely stands his ground to defend his troop only to have his head and hands cut off, as souvenirs for tourists. The message of the film is that the selfish desires of zoos and tourism unite with the selfish desires of the na? tives to make a living. Dian is incensed. She captures a small boy from the raiding party and pretends to be a witch in order to scare him into telling where the party has taken the baby gorilla. Mocking the terrified child's witchcraft beliefs in the interest of her conservation beliefs, she ties him up and pre? tends that she is going to kill him if he does not tell her what she wants to know. She is perfectly willing to violate human rights to protect animal rights, and the audience is expected to sympathize with her efforts. Of course, not all third world people are so primitive and superstitious as the local natives. Government officials in the country are more educated but just as callous toward the gorillas. Dian Fossey confronts the govern? ment official whose permission she requires for her work. He tries to ex? plain his position to her, "Your problem is decreasing gorillas," he pleads with her. "Mine is increasing people. We are on opposite sides of the same problem." She is unmoved by the plight of the people he talks about, but she is very upset about the baby gorilla who has been captured by a zookeeper (who has a German accent) and she reluctantly agrees to nurse the baby back to health to give to the zoo if the government official will, "give my gorillas protection." Angered at her remark, he warns her, "You are a visitor! You don't make government policy," but he does give her rangers in exchange for her help in making a sale to the zookeeper. In the film, the third world is a cruel place of war and poverty, corrupt government, and ignorant, superstitious people with no regard for the wel? fare of the gorillas. There is also a negative, though somewhat different, image of people from the developed, first world. We have already encoun? tered the evil zookeeper with the German accent, and Dr. Leakey, her mentor in absentia, but the central figure from her culture is a National Geographic photographer who comes to do a story on Dian and her gorillas in exchange for considerable financial support for her research. Dian is initially extremely hostile toward this intruder, even though her project needs money. She agrees to allow him to photograph only when he con? vinces her that his pictures and article will ultimately be of benefit to the gorillas by influencing world opinion in support of her cause. His arguments</page><page sequence="7">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 117 gain him a modicum of respect in her eyes. Reluctantly, she takes him out to meet the gorillas, and in a tender, emotional scene, the audience watches him filming her making physical contact for the first time with a huge Sil verback gorilla she has named Digit because of his webbed hand. She lies back sensually into a verdant, tropical undergrowth and Digit tenderly, lov? ingly touches her hand. The scene is framed as a reproduction of the Michelangelo painting in the Sistine Chapel of God reaching out to touch the hand of man. She remarks, "Digit and I have a strange connection. He has no peers in his group. He's alone. I understand that." The pho? tographer immediately falls in love with her. The theme of sexuality and female and male interaction is a strong sub-current in the film. Dian Fossey is clearly devoted foremost to gorillas and no man can take their place. Her photographer lover leaves his wife in order to be with her and offers her a compromise whereby they will live half the time with her "precious" gorillas and half in a place where she can study other primates and he can pursue his work as a professional photographer. There is no compromise possible for Dian. "I'm hooked on gorillas," she tells him. Since the beginning of the film the audience has been given the message that Dian's concern for gorillas (animals) is of a higher moral value than concern for humanity. Now we see this love of gorilla eclipse the love she feels for a particular man. She chooses to sac? rifice her human companion, indeed, her sexuality, for her cause. But when the film suddenly switches to a time five years later, we see an embittered woman. Her fight for the gorillas is now all consuming. Because of the fame of her project, she must begrudgingly allow a few researchers from the outside. When she catches a poacher, she pretends to hang him and takes his "courage" (manhood) by ripping off the amulets around his neck. Again she blasphemes local beliefs for her mission. One young researcher is horrified. "This isn't your private kingdom. That was sick," she says. But Dian is undaunted. And when she catches the same researcher who dared to criticize her, in bed with another researcher, she fires them for sleeping together. "You are here to study gorillas; this is not summer camp," she tells them. She uses the park rangers as her private army and she torches the houses of local people because she suspects them of being poachers. Her tracker warns her, "You go too far." In spite of her extreme efforts, Digit is killed bravely protecting his group and his head and hands are grotesquely removed. In a rage over Digit's death, Dian fires her rangers for not protecting Digit calling them, "lazy, stupid, fucking wogs." Wog is a British racist term meaning, "inferior, dark-skinned foreigner." After lovingly burying Digit, Dian cries when she finally relocates Digit's group. Like her, the audience identifies with this gorilla group as</page><page sequence="8">118 Nash and Sutherland if it were their own family. It is this identification with an animal family that justifies her extreme methods. Overcome with emotion at the sight of a cute baby gorilla tumbling in the undergrowth, she discovers that he is Digit's child since he also has a webbed hand. To protect Digit's band, she now becomes a madwoman in an effort to scare everyone away. She puts out rumors of typhoid in the region to keep out the locals and tourists. She even shoots at a tourist, making light of her action because she only shot "over her head." She brags that because she is famous now no one can touch her. She is stopped in the only way left. She is murdered in her bed with a machete. She is buried next to Digit, their graves encircled with stones to keep in their souls. In death, Dian and Digit are united and purified. In these final scenes the three themes of human/animal (or na? ture/culture), developed/underdeveloped worlds and sexuality (male/fe? male) merge. Dian rejects her own sexuality and the man who loved her in favor of devotion to the gorillas and Digit. She is openly hostile to people from her own culture (and to their sexuality). She is deeply disdainful of the local culture and prejudiced against the people. She denies all rights of humans in favor of animal rights and proclaims the moral superiority of animals over humans. In the final credits we read that Dian Fossey has single-handedly saved the gorillas from extinction. She died for our sins, not to save our souls, but to save the gorillas. Her death sacralizes the Gorilla, she gives her life to uphold a new moral vision, a reversal in the ordering of the human/animal relationship. She becomes the heroine of the defenseless animal world and of those who accept her conception of this reversal of roles. SEMANTIC CATEGORIES IN THE FILM "Gorillas in the Mist" contains categorical meanings which show the emergence of a new resolution of the tensions between nature and culture, between levels of economic development in societies, and between individ? ual sexual action. In broad relief, this complex of ideologies casts Dian Fossey as a savior of animals. Like all messianic characters, she can not exist in the human cultural world. She must sacrifice herself in order to serve as a model for social action. The ideology of animals presented in this film seems to transform some basic precepts of modern culture by challenging assumptions that sup? port the meaning systems of everyday life. First, it confuses distinctions between the characteristics of animal and cultural worlds. It redefines the hierarchy of life, placing animal life over human; and it underscores the</page><page sequence="9">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 119 essentially irredeemable nature of human life by ignoring cultural systems other than those that pertain to the conservation of "nature". It depicts the uncertain character of human sexuality and contrasts it with the tran? scendental possibilities of human-animal contact. It also suggests that the merger of human and animal faith is complete only in a spiritual sense; and, it transforms the message of Christianity. In the new ideology, animals and humans are united: "Man in animal ? Animal in man" versus the tra? ditional cultural version of "God in Man ? Man in God". To more fully appreciate the implications of the new faith, we propose to examine some of the assumptions that underlie the traditional meanings of being human. Since understandings of what constitutes being human re? sult from contrasts with what is defined as not human (cf. Leach, 1964), it seems useful to look at the essential characteristics of humanity. A human, under law and faith, is presumed to have the capacity for rational thought. Further, this capability merges with the emotional poten? tial of humans resulting in assumptions that the ethnomethodologists have outlined as bedrock features of human social life (cf. Cicourel, 1973). Peo? ple are understood as such to the degree that they act in relation to one another. Hence, people who disregard the feelings of others are brutes, and those who seem incapable of rational thought, or are unable to em? pathize with others, are thought of as less than fully human. It is this cul? tural version of what is human that is under attack in "Gorillas in the Mist". Two waves of attack can be identified. First, that humans are the only crea? tures capable of empathie, reflexive action is called into question, and sec? ond that all aspects of human life, particularly, social organization, embody human qualities, is questioned. These attacks on the conventional meaning systems of society can be seen as an ironic result of the modernization process which stresses things over persons. The ratio of animate to inanimate in the context of daily life of modern technological society is weighted heavily in favor of the inani? mate. Further, contacts between living nonhuman things and humans be? come situationally specific, i.e., in the form of interactions with pets, in the process of leisure-time pursuits, or in the framework of occupational ex? perience. Under such conditions, there can be considerable philosophical con? fusion concerning the boundaries between people and the objects of their environments. Both inanimate and nonhuman life forms, then, are under? stood in anthropomorphic terms. As Tuan (1984) has demonstrated, plants and pets are dominated so that they can properly become part of human life, but the process of domination is not as important in the context of understanding the new ideology of animals as is its obverse ? the dehu? manization of people. In this film, we see that to understand the impor</page><page sequence="10">120 Nash and Sutherland tance of the conservation of gorillas, we must come to appreciate the failure of human society to be humane, and the only avenue left for the mainte? nance of the ideals of humanity is in the animal world. Hence, one must die in the human world to become human in the animal, a wholly unchris? tian form of a fall from grace. Such an ideological stance is meaningful only within a context of in? creasingly permeable boundaries between things and people, and people and animals. In ironic fashion, it clarifies the confusion about the proper place of animals in society in both developed and underdeveloped societies by merging human and animals. The film decenters humanity in the world by repositioning it within an animal context. Dian becomes more human when she is with animals and less so when she is with humans. She is an ambiguous symbol of culture and nature, and her ambiguity is played out in her relationships with humans and animals. She selects human relation? ships which fit with her strategy of removing humans from the center of their universe. Professor Leakey is important to her, not because of his standing in the academic world, nor because of the professional opportu? nities contacts with him afford her, but because he is for her an avenue to becoming one with animals. It is her love of animals that qualifies her to do a census of gorillas. According to her, the distinction between animals and humans is es? sentially permeable. She views men and women in love as secondary to the primary definition of nature and culture. For her, the third world is irrele? vant to nature: Third World problems are uninteresting to her and without power to redefine animals in nature. She posits the cultures of third world people as make-believe and evaluates them as part of her presentation of self for the purposes of transforming the primary categories of human being and animals. Her manipulation of beliefs in witchcraft and of the social organization of the natives becomes a device for interpreting the relation? ship between humans and animals. Because Dian becomes more animal-like and the gorillas more like human victims, the relationship between modern cultural precepts of hu? man and animal becomes increasingly blurred, and can be resolved only through a reinterpretation of human and animal who merge in another world where they become souls joined in the afterlife. This symbolic resolution of the problematic relationship between cul? ture and nature reinterprets the meanings of all actions relevant to saving gorillas, offering a new set of beliefs about nature and humans. Hence, abusive tactics in interpersonal relationships, disregard for native cultures as well as instrumental and heretical use of them and rejection of modern culturally approved gender roles and male-female relationships are seen as heroic.</page><page sequence="11">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 121 Table I.

D. Laing), we can offer a sketch of what conditions in society, might have given rise to the phenomena of the humanization of animals, and, hence, the symbolic power of "Gorillas in the Mist." CONDITIONS OF ANIMALS RIGHTS MOVEMENTS In contemporary society, religious belief systems are pluralized and challenged on many fronts. With increased freedom of religion comes in? creased choice in religious beliefs. Correspondingly, with religious prefer? ence increasingly individualized (Bellah et al. 1985), those domains of knowledge which were once exclusively religious become candidates for competing systems. The decrease in efficacy of religious legitimacy creates a vacuum which is filled by alternative accounts of the universe and life and death. Even Christian thinkers may revise their theological interpreta? tions of the human relationship to earth and its creatures. Indeed, this is precisely what Lindsey (1989) attempts to do as he extends divinely given human characteristics such as the possession of a soul and the justification of grace and salvation to animals. Furthermore, the ecumenical movement has spread its net to Native American religions which are viewed as more "naturalistic," and elements of this naturalism are wide spread in new age beliefs, but more generally in ideologies which suggest that animals and the earth are proper objects of reverence and even worship. The ecumenical movement itself may be taken in this context as an indicator of a more this-worldly Christianity. At the very least, it seems that the broadening religious beliefs indicate that traditional conventions, apparently including the sharp distinction between humans and animals, have lost some of their univocal efficacy in defining the image of animals.</page><page sequence="12">122 Nash and Sutherland Changes in family structure might also serve to increase the choices of ways to define the differences between humans and animals in the ani? mal rights ideology. For instance, increased mobility of families and chang? ing constitution of family (blended families) might make keeping pets more difficult. This might lead us to conclude that keeping pets would become less popular. Yet, this is not the case, since pets seem to be as popular as ever, even in large cities and suburbs (cf. Perin, 1988) where pets are often left alone for long periods of the day. However, these changes might ac? count for increases in cat ownership because of the relative ease with which cats may be cared for, compared with dogs. And it also helps account for the data from California which show that the average life of a pet is two years. People tire of caring for an animal and simply dump it at the pound Nationally, about twenty million cats-dogs a year are euthanized. In prac? tical terms, pets require attention, time, care and training ? almost as much as that required for a child. The life style of the youthful middle classes include both an affinity for animals and a desire for freedom. The image of the animal as free in nature evokes a sense of identification with it, but ownership of a pet denies that freedom to the owner who loses freedom in the act of ownership. Pets are euthanized at home, but animals are romanticized in their natural, but distant habitat. One might expect, given these changes in family life, that pets might play a role of decreased importance in the family. However, such rapid and sometimes uprooting changes in the organization of family life might well create an emotional climate in the family enhancing the value of com? panion animals in the home especially in the cases of single individual households, and isolated elder people, for instance. The emotional empti? ness of modern families with their segmentalized arrangements of daily life activities could result in increasing emotional attachments to pets. When there is a pet, the pet can take on overemphasized emotional significance. This could be linked to an increased emphasis on the benefits of pet, as in therapy for the ill, the old or the hospitalized. At the very least, these trends in family life could well be related both to the problems of keeping animals in urban settings such as restraining their movement, and cleaning up their litter (cf. Perin 1988) and the symbolic, moralistic meanings of animals for city dwellers. Hence, it appears that for some people pets are a nuisance, but for others they are a substitute for "human association". Thus, ideological justifications for the humanness of animals also justifies living with animals as companions ? we are all human together. Also, delayed marriages and decreased family size, especially in the middle class, might make pets more important as surrogate human beings. For example, in a family of fifteen (an extended family of children and rela? tives) the pet plays a different role than in the nuclear family of three, or</page><page sequence="13">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 123 two. Constraints of daily schedules alone dictate the amount of time devoted to a pet, and it is in the small, emotionally defined relationship where one is likely to find the strongest moralistic rationale for a pet's existence. Awareness of the fragility of life in a global sense, proposed by the environmental movement might make people think differently about pets and world resources. However, the awareness is not about the depletion of these resources by pets, but that pets become symbols of nature. People who have the least experience with animals in the outdoors, such as the office worker and bureaucrat, as opposed to the dog-handler, hunter or farmer (cf. Kellert 1989) are most likely to equate pets with nature and have an emotional attachment to that idea. Furthermore the mass media have responded to the new animal ide? ology and encouraged it. Animal stories are good press, particularly stories about the suffering of innocent animals brutalized by their owners, just as children are maltreated by parents. For example, newspapers carried a story nationwide about a man in Boston who had been convicted of assault sev? eral times and never served a day in jail. He was finally arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to several years in jail for beating his pet dog with a board. The primary evidence in his case was photographs of the beating taken by his neighbors. IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE Contemporary American culture is infused with notions of relativity ? moral, religious, and philosophical. Particularly in large urban areas, the range and variety of acceptable beliefs and behavior has broadened result? ing in conceptual openness about fundamental questions such as: When does life begin and when does it end? What are the fundamental differ? ences between men and women? or between humans and nonhumans? When consensus about values breaks down, social movements develop, in part to provide a new set of unambiguous values with which to identify or to simplify the complexities of social values. Through such simplification, clear cut answers become available and people may easily take a position. There are many competing ideologies for answers to fundamental questions about what is human and animal, and what rights humans and animals have. Our traditional cultural world view is that humans are supe? rior to animals and take precedence over animals for competing resources. A competing belief is that humans are not better than animals, that the distinction is false and unfairly serves humans over animals. At the other extreme is the belief that animals are better than humans, more natural, more reliable in behavior, more loving, not treacherous, more forgiving and</page><page sequence="14">124 Nash and Sutherland victimized by humans. Animals are seen as innocent and guileless compared with humans whose evil actions threaten all life on earth.3 These are the two poles of an ideological continuum. In the middle is a vast diversity of values. Consider the question of what is a sentient being. Do animals feel any thing more than pain? Are they emotionally sensitive? Do they feel fear, isolation, boredom, and abandonment? Do they have rights to free? dom, medical care ? to life? To live in their natural environment? Where is the line to be drawn among sentient beings? At what point of the evo? lutionary scale? Large furry animals might have feelings, but do cold blooded, scaly animals? As in any social movement, relatively small num? bers of believers are on both ends of the ideological poles. The film "Gorillas in the Mist" has symbolic importance because it identifies a newly emerging animal ideology. It defines the problems of ani? mal/human relationships and offers formula for solutions. In the person of Dian, the problems of the new definitions of animals are played out. While the conflict for Dian was resolved by her murder,4 it continues for audiences of the film, and for society. For audiences of the movie, the contradictions portrayed are dynamic problems for the emergence of new ideologies of animals. For Dian, gorillas are symbols of the impossibility of a resolution of the contradictions in modern culture's answers to the question, "What does it mean to be human?" For those who inhabit a civilization deeply dissociated from nature ? urban and suburban dwellers whose environments are protected from the uncertainties and unpredictability of natural events ? it is possible to construct new images of the world of animals, imbuing them with the human qualities we regard to be our own. The moral supe? riority of animals implies a degradation of humans. Dian Fossy stands as a symbol for the rejection of all that industrial civilization has produced in? cluding the rational, dispassionate attitude of modern humans, the violation of the integrity of the pre-industrial world, the industrialization of live-stock, zoos and the segmentalization of gender roles. ENDNOTES 1. According to Kellert's survey of the American Population in 1978, the attitudes toward animals among the adult American population are 1) a naturalistic attitude which stresses wildlife management and outdoor recreation, such as back country use, nature birding, and nature hunting. Approximately ten percent of his sample expressed this concern, and they have as their core value outdoor recreation. 2) The ecological attitude is found among seven percent who support conservation, are activists and have core ecological values 3) A humanistic attitude exists among about thirty-five percent of the sample. People with this attitude have pets, are interested in wildlife tourism, visit zoos and are concerned with companionship and affection from animals. 4) A moralistic attitude is found in twenty percent of the sample. These people are involved in animals welfare</page><page sequence="15">The Case of Gorillas in the Mist 125 support, are members of organizations devoted to animal issues, stress kind and ethical treatment of animals and espouse values that assert the rights of animals to exist. 5) A small (one percent) portion of the sample sees animals scientifically, that is, they are interested in animals as objects of study, as species to be collected, and they are primarily concerned with scientific knowledge about animals. 6) Fifteen percent of the sample ex? hibits an aesthetic attitude which motives them to appreciate nature, wildlife art and tourism, and for whom the beauty of nature is the core interest. 7) The utilitarian attitude is found in twenty percent of the sample, and these people buy furs, support the use of animal products such as meat, may hunt for meat, and are primarily interested in animals for the uses to which they can be put. 8) The dominionisitic attitude characterizes three percent of the sample. Its proponents engage in animal spectator sports, such as trophy hunting, and have a fundamentally negative attitude toward animals. 9) Closely related to dominionistic attitudes is the negativistic attitude found among those two percent of the sample who are cruel toward animals, overtly fearful of them, and who express little or negative sentiments toward all animals. 10) Finally, the neutralistic attitude, thirty-five percent of the sample, is found among people who avoid animals, but are not particularly hostile toward them. These people have little interest in or negative sentiments toward animals Kellert's figures refer to percentage of people in the sample who expressed a particular concern. The percentages, therefore, total more than one hundred (Kellert 1988, p 140-41). 2. These groups include PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), ALF (Ani? mal Liberation Front) and in Minnesota, ARC (Animal Rights Coalition). 3. This figure is an estimate from the American Humane Association shelter reporting study 1987 and does not include animals killed by disease, trauma, exposure, or privately by vets. (Personal correspondence, Dr. Patricia Olson, veterinarian). 4. The most radical expression of this sentiment we were able to document is an appeal published in the Earth First! Journal. Persons suffering terminal disease are encouraged to undertake eco-kamikaze missions. Suggestions for types of missions terminally ill war? riors might want to consider included blowing up dams, bombing the headquarters of oil spilling corporations, fur warehouses, and paper mills. To quote from the Journal "To those feeling suicidal, this [eco-kamikaze missions] may be an answer to your dreams . . . Don't jump off a bridge, blow up a bridge! Who says you can't take it with you?" (as reported in Washington Times, August 1, 1990). 5. It is appropriate irony that the gorilla population of central Africa which was in such decline when Dian Fossey surveyed it is now increasing. It is increasing not because of devotion to animals by converted local officials, nor from the moral guidance of the ani? mal rights movement, but because tourists want to see the gorillas. Hence, local govern? ments have discovered that gorillas are good tourist attractions. REFERENCES Bellah, Robert, et al. 1985. Habits of the Heart; Individualism and Commitment in American Life.
