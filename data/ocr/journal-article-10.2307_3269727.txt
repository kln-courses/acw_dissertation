Kohlhammer, 1977, 512 p., DM 98.- Walter Burkert is one of the leading authorities today in the field of Greek religion, and this monumental work is a noble testimony to his remarkably thorough and wide-ranging knowledge of this subject. As a general survey of the literary and archaeological evidence down to the time of Aristotle it will be of immense value to scholars. But it is not simply a collection of material, in the manner of much of Nilsson's great Geschichte der Griechischen Religion. One is conscious through- out of a powerful, reflecting mind, seeking to penetrate beneath the surface, and to comprehend the underlying impulses and motives behind these phenomena. At the same time, the author has controlled the natural desire to find a single guiding thread to the apparent labyrinth of Greek polytheism, a temptation which has in the past tended to bedevil attempts to understand this subject. Burkert's own previous book, Homo Necans (I972), was to some extent an example of this tendency. In his new book he has adopted a more objective standpoint, although nevertheless keeping certain leading themes in view, and main- taining what one could still call a broadly anthropological approach. In particular, his familiarity with Near Eastern material often enables him to set his subject in the wider context of the religions of the Near East in general, rather than treating it in isolation. The first section is devoted to a survey of the evidence for the development of religion in Greece from the Neolithic period to the end of the Dark Ages. Linguistic criteria are used to identify elements common to other Indo-European cultures, and a balanced and up-to- date review is given of the Minoan and Mycenean evidence, as far as this can be assessed. In his discussion of the question of continuity in the Dark Ages Burkert stresses the break in the archaeological evidence for most mainland sites, without losing sight of the links which bind later Greek religion with that of the Mycenean period. The next section gives a clear and succinct account of the main forms of ritual (sacrifice, prayer, purification, festivals etc.), their contexts (sanctuary, temple, altar, etc.), and the people concerned (priesthood, prophecy etc.). There follows a section on the gods, beginning with general observa- tions on the part played by early poetry and art in moulding men's ideas; going on to a discussion of individual deities, their origins (where these can be ascertained), nature and functions, and closing with some interesting remarks on "the individual character of Greek anthropomorphism". A section on the dead, heroes and chthonic deities naturally follows, in which borderline figures such as Heracles, the Dioscuri and Asclepius are also considered. The archaic and classical periods were the time of the polls com- munity par excellence, and Burkert next discusses various aspects of Numen, Vol. XXVI, Fasc. 2</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 263 Greek religion as the religion of the community. Here he stresses, against the modern structuralists, the "open-ended" character of clas- sical polytheism: it cannot be reduced to a single closed system, al- though it remains true that different deities and cults answer different social needs, and also (in contrast to most Oriental religions) that the Olympian family remained of a limited size. This leads on to a discus- sion of various forms of association and contrast between deities (e.g. pairs, old and young) and a special chapter on Dionysus in relation to other gods. Then the calendars of festivals are considered, and some instances of festival cycles, a subject more extensively treated in Homo Necans. Next come various social aspects: the fundamental problem of amoral gods who are also guardians of justice; oaths and other sanctions; family rituals, and larger state organisations; initiation and other rituals designed to cope with crisis-points in personal and public life. This section concludes with valuable comments on certain leading religious terms in the field of the sacred, the holy and the divine. Burkert has now progressed from a consideration of externals (ritual, etc.) through the objects and aims of worship (the gods in relation to organised human society), to internal aspects. One now realises that this is also to some extent a historical progression, from his survey of the prehistoric period through that of the classical polis, leading on to the development of philosophy, which produced a revolution in the concept of divinity and man's relations with god. All the aspects which seemed to be lacking in earlier Greek religion (belief, dogma, internal moral purity, love for god and a striving towards likeness with god) gradually begin to emerge in philosophy and literature from the late archaic period onwards, finding their culmination in Plato. Here one can indeed speak of a "revolution in religious language and attitudes" (p. 412). Before considering philosophy, however, Burkert devotes a section to what can be seen as a transitional theme, that of the mystery cults. This includes discussion of local mysteries, the major cults of Samo- thrace and Eleusis, mysteries of Dionysus, the difficult problems re- lating to Orpheus and Pythagoras, and the various forms of ascetic life connected with these cults. Burkert stresses how these developments could come into conflict with the normal religion of the community, and how they foreshadow developments in the religions of later anti- quity. Finally, in some forty pages, which are again a masterpiece of clarity and succinctness, Burkert describes the impact on religion of Greek philosophy, down to the time of Aristotle. He shows how it could come about, in spite of the onslaught of the philosophers, that the traditional fabric of cults and gods could survive and continue to exist until the end of the pagan world. From the theories and criticisms of the pre- Socratic philosophers we progress to the rescue of religion through the metaphysics and cosmology of Plato and his followers, anticipated</page><page sequence="3">264 Book reviews already in the activities of the early allegorists. The Socratic and Platonic emphasis on the individual soul and its relationship with the divine is complemented by a view of the world as a whole in which the gods still have a part to play: the world-soul of the Timaeus manifests its harmony in the movement of the stars, which are themselves divine beings. These visible gods could later by means of allegory be identified with the gods of mythology, and so keep their place in the order of things. The problem which this solution left unresolved was that of the gods' attitude to men. In Plato's Laws they do care for mankind, but Aristotle is less dogmatic. Such a high philosophical attitude left a vacuum for the ordinary man, who turned to less exalted forms of belief, such as magic, for consolation, or fell back on the ancient comfort of traditional rituals and ceremonies duly performed. Burkert's book thus has a structure and direction which carries one forward, in spite of the inevitable compression and complexity of the material. Those who wish for guidance on particular topics will find the notes invaluable. They are compact and accessible at the foot of each page, and the system of cross-referencing is clear and easy to use. I have also found the Indices a valuable aid. I come now to queries and disagreements, of which I have only noted a few in the course of reading through the work. Burkert accepts the hypothesis that the volcanic eruption of Thera caused the destruction of some of the Cretan palaces (p. 49). This theory was always question- able, and at the latest Thera conference in 1978 it seems to have been abandoned by archaeologists and vulcanologists alike. Burkert would like to believe that the deity worshipped at Ayia Irini in Ceos in the Mycenean period was Dionysus, and that there was continuity of cult throughout the Dark Ages (pp. 65, 86, 364). But his various references here are confusing. The head which was re-used as an object of cult at the end of the Geometric period was that of one of the female statues of the fifteenth century B.C., and its torso was found a metre lower down. In the Archaic period the cult is shown by dedications to have been that of Dionysus. But there appears to be a break in the cult after the end of the Mycenean period (cf. Coldstream, Geometric Greece 209 f.), and it is usually assumed that this is a case where the cult of a female deity in the Bronze Age has been replaced by one of a male god in the historic period. It is theoretically possible that it was a male god who was worshipped also in the Bronze Age, that all the statues are of worshippers, and that a tradition of this cult survived, wrongly attached to the female head. But there are hardly sufficient grounds for assum- ing this. The literary traditions discussed by Eisner (GRBS 1972, 123 ff.) suggest the survival of some memories of the Minoan period, but the links with Dionysus are tenuous. It should be said, however, that Burkert himself is aware that the connection is speculative (p. 364). In Grazer Beitriige 1975, 51 ff., Burkert discussed the possible con-</page><page sequence="4">Book reviews 265 nections between Apollo and the Near Eastern god Relep, with whom he was identified in Cyprus. He then went on to suggest an association between Apollo-Relep and the development of temple, cult-statue and free-standing altar in Greece, and to argue that the practice by the Greeks of burning animal bones as a sacrifice was introduced from the Near East via Cyprus after the end of the Bronze Age. In his new book Burkert refers to these theories, and states that a Greek tradition actually tells of the "invention" of animal sacrifice in Cyprus (Ascle- piades FGH 752FI; Burkert p. 95). This passage, however, is ambig- uous. According to Porphyry, Asclepiades described how animal sacri- fice came to be practised in Cyprus: but there is no suggestion here that the Greeks learnt of it from Cyprus. Burkert seems inclined to accept the view of Yavis, in his book Greek Altars (1949), that burnt animal sacrifice was not practised in Bronze Age Greece. At the same time he is aware that some of the archaeological evidence is clearly against Yavis (pp. 39 f., 66, 72, 95). But Burkert also follows Meuli's analysis of the origins and meaning of the classical Greek sacrifice, whereby it derives from a primitive hunting period, in which the hunter goes through an elaborate ritual designed to restore the dead animal to life and to relieve his own feelings of guilt at its killing (pp. lo4 f., cf. Homo Necans). Consequently this form of sacrifice must be "both very ancient and also post-Mycenean" (p. 97). Burkert's theory of Near Eastern influence has surely led him here into an awkward situation. As Rose pointed out in his review of Yavis' book (JHS 1950, 91 f.) the Homeric account of sacrificial ritual suggests that this was some- thing very old within Greek tradition. The archaeological evidence for Bronze Age Greece is complicated by possible differences between Minoan and Mycenean practice, but it seems to me very likely that the Myceneans at least practised much the same ritual as their descendants in Homer's own time. The question of the emergence of the classical complex of altar, temple and cult-statue is rather a matter of the introduction of the monumental building to house the god's image, in association with the altar which had always been the fundamental feature of a cult. Here, of course, one may well look for Near Eastern influence on the development of temples and cult-statues, rather than on that of altars and sacrifice. Generally speaking Burkert's emphasis on the ritual of animal sacri- fice as the central act of Greek religion is surely basically correct, whatever psychological or social explanations one may offer for it. There are, however, some places where it seems to me that he may have been led to give more prominence to this element than the evidence for the classical period suggests, for example in the Anthesteria (p. 361), or in the mystery cults of Eleusis and elsewhere (pp. 415, 430). In his discussion of the name "Apollo" Burkert refers (p. 227) to the ingenious article (Rhein. Museum 1975, I ff.) in which he argued for a connection with the Dorian word apellai. I find it impossible, how-</page><page sequence="5">266 Book reviews ever, to believe that the name has a purely Doric origin, and only spread to the rest of Greece in the Dark Ages, as he seems to suggest. Moreover, there is the problem of the form "Apeilon" in Cypriote and Pamphylian, which he ascribes to Dorian settlers. Kiechle, to whom Burkert referred (Lakonien und Sparta 68 ff.), argued that it was pre-Dorian settlers from Laconia who brought the name to Cyprus. This is surely far more likely to be correct. The Attic-Ilonic month names are another element where Burkert's view produces what seems an awkward situation chronologically. He is surely right to argue that they antedate the Ionian migration, but because they differ from the names in Linear B he believs them to be post-Mycenean (p. 346). This does not leave much time for their devel- opment ! I do not see why they should not be earlier, and at the same time different from those of Cnossos and Pylos. In discussing the Attic festival of Artemis called the Brauronia, Burkert accepts the commonly stated assumption that the girls who served as attendants of the goddess, and were known as "bears", lived at Brauron for a long period, perhaps as much as four years (p. 395). But when the chorus in Aristophanes' Lysistrata (645) say "I was a bear at the Brauronia", this suggests that they performed the office at the festival. This is also what is implied by the Scholia on this passage. There is no certain evidence that they went through a lengthly period of "ritual seclusion" in the sanctuary, although of course they may have stayed for a time, over the period of the festival. An inscription from Brauron mentions "the Amphipoleion in which.., live", but there is a lacuna at the vital point (cf. the only published photograph, in the article by J. Papadimitriou, Scientific American, June 1963, 118 f.). The "Parthenon", also mentioned in inscriptions, was a building in which offerings were kept (cf. T. Linders, Studies in the Treasure Records of Artemis Brauronia 71 f.), perhaps the shrine now called the "tomb of Iphigeneia", where offerings and inventories of offerings were found. The rooms in the Stoa were almost certainly dining-rooms not living quarters (Linders 1.c.; 'J. J. Coulton, The Architectural Development of the Greek Stoa 9, 43). Further vases connected with the ritual have now been published by Lily Kahil in Antike Kunst 20 (1977), 86 ff. One actually shows a woman with a bear's-head mask and a long robe (perhaps the krokotos), together with another figure with a bear's head, in the presence of Leto, Apollo and Artemis. In his account of the Eleusinian Mysteries Burkert states that myesis (initiation) took place individually, and that it could be performed in the Eleusinion at Athens as well as at Eleusis (p. 427). Both of these statements may be correct, but the epigraphic evidence is again too fragmentary for any certain conclusion (cf. my edition of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, pp. 20 f.). Finally I have one or two general observations about Burkert's approach. A historian might complain that more attention should have</page><page sequence="6">Book reviews 267 been paid in the section on the polis to the ways in which religion was used and adapted in the classical period for political ends (cf. for example Nilsson's Cults, Myths, Oracles and Politics). A literary scholar, on the other hand, might well object that much of the real life and colour of Greek religion is lacking in so general an analysis. A few quotations from Aristophanes, for example, can sometimes tell one more about what religion meant to an Athenian of the late fifth century than anything else. In this respect Parke's recent book on Athenian festivals does at least attempt to give a more vivid picture. It is easy to object that Trygaeus' or Dicaeopolis' view of religion is crude, con- centrating as it does largely on eating and drinking and concomitant pleasures, but if the communal, sacrificial meal is at the social centre of Greek religion, such a simple view may in fact come nearer the heart of the matter than one might at first suppose. Literary forms, such as those of hymns and prayers, can also tell us much. It is significant that the section on "Tanz und Lied" is only two pages long, and that "hymns" are not mentioned in the Indices! Burkert is usually scrupu- lous in referring to the literary evidence, but one would have liked it to have been allowed to speak for itself more often. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to complain, where there is so much to praise. This is a work which very few scholars nowadays could hope to rival, and in its range and depth it fully deserves its place in a series devoted to "the religions of mankind."
