Illustrations, Notes, Biblio graphy, Index. "Malay society has long been noted as presenting an intriguing paradox. On the one hand, Malay culture is characterized by refined restraint. On the other, it is famous as the source of one of the most extreme forms of culturally specific violent behavior ? amok. These remarkable contradictions can only be properly understood in the context of a careful exploration of the social psychology of Malay culture" (p. v). So begins the I.M. Lewis' foreword to Emotions of Culture, an interdisciplinary collection of works edited by Wazir J. Karim. The editor states the objectives of the work as reaffirming the position of psycho logy in anthropology and revitalizing the empirical base of the discipline. She notes that rich data are available on the psychology of the Peninsular Malays and argues that although there are comparisons to be made with other Southeast Asian popula tions, psychological anthropology has not been relied upon in the analysis of Malay culture. Wazir Karim maintains that there is a place for emotions in cultural analysis and that, indeed, the study of such phenomena is necessary for the understanding of culture. From this perspective the book commences with a broad introductory chapter on emotions, tracing the historical development of anthropological studies in the area and citing background research on emotions in Malay society. This is followed by contributions on emotion in courtship and marriage (Wazir Karim), martial arts (Razha Rashid), amok (Robert Winzeler), latah (Michael Kenny) and ecstatic dance (Mohamed Ghouse Nasruddin). One of the most interesting chapters is offered by the editor herself. After providing a brief background on Malay courtship and marriage she adeptly demonstrates the social construction of emotion in relation to language and custom. The analysis high lights the unity of mind, body, spirit and society in Malay culture. We are told that the liver is seen as the basis of emotions and that emotional terms are linked both to stable personality dispositions (e.g., baik had, kind; busuk had, jealous and malicious) and transient states (e.g., gila cinta, excessive infatuation or romantic love). The signi</page><page sequence="2">472 Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 23, 2 (1992) ficance of social labelling of emotional states and the social consequences of emotional expression are emphasized. For example, it is explained that intense emotional bouts of gila cinta are seen as temporary, but unavoidable, and often necessitate parental intervention and hasty marriage. Although Wazir Karim's description of the study of emotions in contemporary psychology is debatable, she weaves a fine tapestry of psychology and anthropology in the account of emotional aspects of courtship and marriage. In addition, and as an unexpected delight, she provides love charms for the forlorn! A second persuasive chapter is offered by Kenny in his research on latah. After defining and describing the phenomenon, the author concentrates on underlying theories, including psycho-social (social protest), medical (psychopathology) and in digenous frameworks (weak semangat) for the examination of latah. Kenny points out, quite accurately, that Western medical approaches have tended to label the condition as pathological. Indeed, latah has been referred to in the psychiatric literature as a culture bound-syndrome and described as hysterical/histrionic and as a hyperstartle response [Simons, R.C. "The resolution of the latah paradox", in R.C. Simons &amp; C.C. Hughes (eds.), The culture bound syndromes, pp. 43-62 (Boston: Reidel, 1985)], although Colson's [A.C. Colson, "The perception of abnormality in a Malay village", in N.N. Wagner &amp; E.S. Tan (eds.), Psychological problems and treatment in Malaysia, pp. 88-101 (Kuala Lumpur: University of Malaya Press, 1971)] ethnographic data in dicates that it is perceived as lain dari biasa tetapi betul (different from usual, but correct) by the Malays. Kenny presents an insightful analysis, emphasizing emotional elements of the phenomenon in a socio-cultural context and noting the significance of gender, status, and life transitions in the emergence of latah. This is far more con vincing than medical accounts of the condition and is consistent with the book's psycho-anthropological perspective on emotions in Malay culture. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Winzeler's chapter on amok which offers a basic historical description of the phenomenon rather than a critical contemporary psychological or anthropological analysis of emotional and behavioural elements of amok. Less familiar to most readers will be the topics discussed by Razha Rashid and Mohamed Ghouse Nasruddin. In the former case, the author describes Malay martial arts, highlighting ideological and psychological influences of emotions on practitioners of silat. Razha Rashid considers various forms of ritual combat with emphasis on self-control in the art of self-defence. He describes the traditional belief that the kris (Malay dagger) assumes anthropomorphic qualities and transforms the restraint and self-control of silat into violence and aggression in crisis situations. The violence is then "justified by deep-rooted emotions that develop in a person's mystical and magical relationship with his kris" (p. 84). The contrast of elegant restraint with violent out bursts, interpreted in a magical context, along with the traditions of Malay martial heroism, parenthetically offers a clue to the dynamics of amok. The concluding chapter describes the kuda kepang (hobby horse) dance, its origins and contemporary ideology in the practice of ritual trance. The dance movements are elaborated, and the ritual is discussed as participatory art with emphasis on the fusion of the experiences of the performers and the audience. While the chapter is certainly engaging, it would have been more in line with the objectives of the work if the author had considered the phenomenology of the ecstatic dance and the psychological consequences for the participants.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 473 In conclusion, Emotions of Culture has much to offer to Southeast Asian scholars. It advances psychological anthropology in the region and offers keen insights into the definition, phenomenology, and social and psychological significance of emotions in the Malay community. Despite its explicit orientation, the book crosses social scientific and medical boundaries and, as such, will be of interest not only to anthropologists and cross-cultural psychologists, but also to sociologists, social workers and transcultural psychiatrists. The work also provides a sound base for a forthcoming companion volume on women and hysteria in Malaysia. University of Canterbury Colleen Ward</page></plain_text>
