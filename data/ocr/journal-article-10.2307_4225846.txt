Mitchell, and Erich Zimmer- mann were almost solitary voices against the thesis that resources were natural. The central focus of economics was then, and remains now, on the scarcity of resources. If, on the issue of likely resource exhaustion, the vast majority of economists now argue against the limits to growth, it is not a conclusion derived from "neoclassical" economic theory. Rather, it is because the overwhelming preponderance of evidence from study after study has shown that, by every measure of real price and availability, virtually all resources are becoming more abundant.' If these economists have violated their theories, at least they have preserved a fidelity to accumulating evidence, a characteristic sadly lacking in John Gowdy's comment above, "GAIA and Technological Utopianism." If technology creates resources, then, as Ayres was forever pointing out, the way we allocate resources determines their scarcity. Similarly, we can ask of those who explain the extraordinary growth in world food production as the result of "land augmenting" scientific research, what- ever happened to the Ricardian notion of land as the fixed factor of production? One would think that institutionalists, as inheritors of an intellectual heritage in the understanding of the power of science and technology to create resources, would feel vindicated in a world in which population has doubled in about a generation, in which per cap- ita income and per capita food supply have grown at record rates, and in which most commodities (food, fiber, and minerals) are deemed this year (1986) to be in oversupply. If Professor Gowdy has any evidence of "rapidly dwindling stocks" of anything, would he please let us know. Unfortunately, too many institutionalists have preferred to play the role of perpetual outsider, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, and abandoning any idea as soon as it enters the intellectual main- stream of economics. A more fruitful approach would be to use the re- ality of these facts as an opening wedge to question the fundamental assumptions of the mainstream of the discipline and to demonstrate that only one body of theory-institutionalism-has correctly pre- dicted the course of recent global events. The link Professor Gowdy makes between the institutionalist, the "neoclassical," or even the Marxist conception of resources, is at best superficial. To refer to the thesis advanced in my article as "technologi- cal utopianism," particularly as an institutionalist perspective is, to say</page><page sequence="2">478 Notes and Communications the least, perverse. Fundamental to the institutionalist perspective is the view of technology as a problem-solving process without the need for it to be problem free. It is not entirely consistent for the author to attack me for finding enemies and hazards in nature and at the same time to suggest that my mentors and I are utopian. On the "two specific shortcomings" of my article, I stand unrepen- tant. I was aware and remain aware of Georgescu-Roegen's work, have read it and used it, and have noted my great respect for his work even though I disagree with his conclusions.2 Though I do not use Georgescu-Roegen's terms, "stocks and funds," nearly half my article is about carrying capacity and about ideas such as energy budgets, which are basic to his concept of a fund.3 I do plead guilty in not accept- ing its significance. "Solar energy" may be a "fund that may only be used at a limited rate," but as the data in my book show, we are not even remotely near that limit or any of the other limits claimed.4 Fur- ther, I argue that there is no pre-existing "fund of environmental assimulative capacity." For most of the world, the carrying capacity for intelligent tropical primates without technology is zero. It is ironic that some of the areas experiencing some of the greatest difficulties in eco- nomic development are the likely original and natural habitats of our progenitors. Our stocks are not fixed, either. There are obviously limits to the energy in a ton of coal, but our ability to extract it is dependent upon technology and changes with new technologies. As Nathan Rosenberg has shown, in 1900 one kilowatt hour of electricity required seven pounds of coal to produce it; by the 1960s it required only 0.9 of a pound.5 To say that the "sun is not a source of 'negative entropy' " is in error, since the term (sometimes called "negentropy") is in common use and, just as I used it in regards to the sun, can be found correctly in works by many authors, including that of the Nobel Prize winning- physicist, Erwin Schrodinger.6 If Professor Gowdy's statement is meant to imply that there is no such term or concept as "negative entropy," then I am afraid he is even more grievously in error. It is made clear in my article that entropy applies within a closed system, and that neg- ative entropy in a subsystem is dependent on an increase in entropy in the total system.7 What Professor Gowdy presumes to be clarifying or correcting by his statements to this effect is unclear; moreover, he omits my further observation that there is no theory or evidence to suggest that the activities of human beings creating resources and building civilizations has any impact whatsoever on the increasing entropy of the sun. In short, however interesting Professor Gowdy's argument may be, it is irrelevant to our concerns.</page><page sequence="3">Notes and Communications 479 On the Gaia hypothesis, the author faults me for an interpretation consistent with James Lovelock's grand statment in GAIA.8 My phras- ing was that Lovelock "treats the entire ecosystem ... as an integrated living system;" he speaks "of the hypothesis that the entire range of living matter on earth ... could be regarded as constituting a single liv- ing entity."9 Throughout this magnificent book, in speaking of the eco- system, he makes anthropomorphic references to organs and uses the pronoun "her"; so that others have also understood Lovelock to be de- scribing a living system. Since I find the thesis heuristic, I am delighted that Lovelock clarified it in an article that was presumably published after mine went to press. Professor Gowdy is to be credited for his lucid statement of GAIA as a cybernetic system. Lovelock attributes the idea and the coining of the term "cybernetics" to Norbert Weiner. To Wei- ner, cybernetic systems are "islands of decreasing entropy" that enable "us to assert the existence of progress."'0 Lovelock, in searching for ba- sic characteristics of life on earth and elsewhere in the solar system, begins with "entropy reduction" or "a member of a class of phenomena which are open or continuous systems able to decrease their internal entropy," which are alternate ways of stating negative entropy."I Within a cybernetic system, Lovelock recognizes increasing information as a force for furthering the system and he sees energy and information sources as interrelated.'2 Lovelock addresses the question of the use of fossil fuels and the re- sulting CO2 buildup in the atmosphere, marshalls evidence, and ex- presses a modicum of skepticism.'3 I, too, have tried to survey the ever-growing body of literature and found that there is mixed scientific opinion on the subject.'4 One recent news article in a reputable scien- tific journal on the latest findings concerning CO2 build-up, cited by Gowdy, should be taken seriously but should by no means close out inquiry. It is a potential problem and we should use the best in science and technology to study it and to come to terms with it. I strongly sup- port the projected International Geosphere-Biosphere Program, a study of global change and a Gaia-like attempt to study the totality of the biosphere and human involvement with it.' Professor Gowdy's one- sentence conclusion as to the consequences of global warning is a gross over-simplification of a very complex issue. As Lovelock correctly notes, predicting tomorrow's weather is tricky enough; predicting cir- cumstances a hundred years from now is quite alot more difficult.16 Professor Gowdy's assertions on early life processes contain serious errors of fact. The oxygen that "poisoned" the early atmosphere, an oc- currence Margulis and Sagan call the Oxygen Holocaust, was released from the breaking of the bonds of water molecules during the process</page><page sequence="4">480 Notes and Communications of photosynthesis, not from decaying bodies.'7 The first photosynthe- sizers were also procaryotes. It is not true, furthermore, that they are "no longer with us." Bacteria are procaryotes and they are not only with us, they are quite literally within us by the quadrillion. We could go on and on, piling up quotes from Lovelock on waste (that is, pollution) as an inevitable part of the life process, or citing his arguments that misused primitive technologies do more environmental damage than modem technology, or that feeding people should take priority over excessive environmental concerns.'8 It would fortify my point that some of the romantic enthusiasts for Gaia have not read Lovelock carefully or extensively. Professor Gowdy's closing attack against me is in reality a diatribe against what has been a strong tendency in institutionalism for half a century. His point is unclear. In faulting me for finding "enemies" in nature or-following John Dewey-hazards in life, is he implying that there are no enemies in nature or hazards in life? If he is not implying that, then he has no point. When I spoke of enemies that we turned into allies, I referred to wind and then to the ergot fungus or mold. Lovelock, in an awesome catalogue of poisonous and dangerous natural substances, refers to this aflatoxin as being mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic and the cause of "a vast amount of human misery through stomach cancer resulting from the eating of peanuts naturally polluted by this aggressive chemical."'9 Referring to the same fungus that causes the "incurable affliction known as St. Anthony's fire," Mar- gulis and Sagan also note the many ways we use the lysergic acid within it "in small amounts to induce childbirth, stop afterbirth, and aid coro- nary seizures."20 How better to describe this than as turning an enemy into an ally. If the author believes that there are no enemies in nature, is he willing to advocate that we eat fungus-infected peanuts, rye, or maize, or other "natural" foods that are the lot of poorer peoples around the globe whose access to modern technology is limited. Professor Gowdy's assertion that I believe "that everything will take care of itself' is a gross distortion of my article, since I state that we have to "attack ... problems ... with imagination and creativity." By no stretch of the imagination could that quote, the full quote, or the entire article, be taken as an argument "that everything will take care of itself."'" The view contrary to mine, implied but never stated, that nature is benign, is far closer to a position of letting things take care of themselves than anything I or Ayres or any of the mainstream institu- tionalists has ever stated. It is also utopian. Whether or not Professor Gowdy believes nature is benign is uncer- tain. Beyond, possibly, despair, he offers no alternative, let alone a</page><page sequence="5">Notes and Communications 481 workable alternative, to the intelligent use of modern technology. My view is that if we act with intelligence, using imagination, science, and technology, we just might be able to foresee potential hazards or catas- trophes, manmade or natural, and take actions that give us the possibil- ity of overcoming them. It is modern science and technology, after all, with all its many problems, that has created the conditions that make it possible for five billion human inhabitants today to live on this globe. Lovelock provides a cautionary tale: "there can be no voluntary res- ignation from technology," since "we are inextricably part of the technosphere. There have been numerous groups who have tried to es- cape from modern society and return to nature. Nearly all have failed, and when the rare partial successes are examined, strong support from the rest of us is always present."22 In the most advanced technological areas, as in earlier times, humans have created the framework that has allowed other technologies to function, along with the lifestyles therein implied. Modern technology has, in fact, provided a wonderful haven for those who reject it, but to reject is a luxury that, intellectually or practically, the rest of us cannot afford. Thomas R.
