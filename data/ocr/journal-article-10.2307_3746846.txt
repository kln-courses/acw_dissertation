<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS then there follows until the end of the work the (exposition and) refutation of Subjective Idealism by its non-Buddhistic opponents, viz., the advocates of the Jaina Realism (chapter iv), Samkhya-Yoga Realism (v), Mimamsaka Realism (vi), Nyaya-Vaisesika Realism (vii), and finally by Safikara and the founders or chief representatives of the other Vedantic schools. There is a section also, in this last chapter, on Ramanuja's criticism of the Buddhistic (Sautrantika) Realism. The one thing we miss is a chapter or appendix on the establishment and criticism of Subjective Idealism within the school of Sankara (drsti-srsti-vdda, eka-jiva-vada). F. OTTO SCHRADER. The Nature of Truth. An Essay. By H. H. JOACHIM. Second edition. (London: Oxford University Press, Humphrey Milford. 1939. Pp. viii + 182. Price 8s. 6d. net.) It is now a third of a century since the first edition of this rather famous essay appeared, and there is still a demand for the book, despite the dissemination of two thousand copies. That is as it should be. There are few, if any, exposi- tions of the metaphysics and epistemology of "truth" in our language that are as complete as Joachim's (despite its brevity), and few, if any, that so happily combine wide and faithful scholarship with deep and resolute argu- ment. The author himself thought that no answer had been given to the second chapter of the essay, and that until such an answer was given, "logical analysis" and "logical positivism" had to be adjudged confused and worth- less. His readers to-day might have been even more grateful than they are had Joachim, instead of producing this bland and blank negative, made some attempt, even the smallest, to show why he rejected the numerous replies that his book provoked, and (for instance) had explored the question why "external" relations could not relate. More generally, some readers may think that he was and remained too confident a Bradleian, even in his very diffidence regarding what must be yet, if it could be at all, must be greatly dark. But, however that may be, it is beyond dispute that Joachim wrote with a scrupulous care and with a nervous elegance (although not always, I think, with a precision) that gave wide pleasure and deserved universal praise. It is characteristic of him that one of the most beautiful of the many beautiful passages in the book is a footnote (p. I6I). This second edition has been efficiently and unobtrusively edited by Professor Collingwood. It is reprinted photographically from corrected sheets of the first edition. The corrections are not numerous. Some of the corrected pages are not quite pleasant to the eye, and the correction of one sentence -the last of the second paragraph on p. 64-seems to have had a mischievous effect upon the preceding sentence. These, however, are trivialities. In sub- stance this second edition is a true picture of the best work of one of the finest minds of our time. JOHN LAIRD. Four Ways of Philosophy. By IRWIN EDMAN. (London: Constable &amp; Company, Ltd. I939. Pp. viii + 33I. Price I2s. net.) Readers of Philosophy will know, if only from Professor Laird's recent view of this author's Philosopher's Holiday, that in Professor Edman they may look for an urbane and effective critic of life and thought, and for no mean stylist. In the present volume (an expansion of four lectures given at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and now dedicated to that great American 213</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY liberal, Benjamin Cardozo) they will find him returning from holiday themes to his work as a philosopher. Philosophy as he interprets it takes, in the main, four ways, namely: the way of logical faith (i.e. rationalism or idealism), of social criticism, of mystical insight (to which we might give the name 'supra-logical faith'), and of nature understood (i.e. naturalism). "It is not insisted upon," the author remarks, "that these are exhaustive . . . but it is submitted that these four, easily recognizable . . . are not only chrono- logically recurrent but psychologically typical" (p. I9). He does not in set terms discuss either scepticism, certainly perennial and typical, or pheno- menalism, a philosophy now followed by many, and always by some since the days of the Megarians. The first way is the anthropomorphic. It turns on the universalizing, in one way or another, of human intellect and human morality. Of this Professor Edman with William James judges firmly, howsoever gracefully, that it is the path of the tender minded. Its undoubted 'nobility' is merely that of the 'romantic imagination' (p. 88). His second is that which runs-a long but still the same road-from the fifth-century sophists to his own Dewey (of whose crabbed prose he quotes, with apparent approval, some grim examples). All these, in their several ways, make success the ultimate standard. While some philosophies belong openly to this type, all are in some measure social criticisms. They inevitably, if undesignedly, reflect the ethos of a time and place. The third, or mystical, way Professor Edman traces kindly but without conviction. He rightly points out that "The most empirical of thinkers is compelled to begin with data and with assumptions which he can neither prove nor refuse to accept. In the beginnings of thought, and in its culmination, philosophers touch the non-rational immediate . . ." (p. 222), Thus at points they willy-nilly join hands with the mystic, who, however. welcomes what they rather resent. The naturalist way, which is the author's, he modestly leaves until the last. His exposition of this variant of the philosophic theme brings him pretty close to Santayana. His naturalism renounces mechanism of the L'Homme Machine sort, asserting in its place that "Naturalism is simply a faith in the unity of nature or substance, of which all life is a derivation, upon which all action is posited, and within which the structure of mechanism is seen to be simply a systematized technique of practice and of economical understanding" (p. 268). Such a position is "an animal faith, not a theory." That it "makes no metaphysical generalizations," however, is a little difficult to swallow when, for example, we are told, "All the naturalist means by nature is that which in experience he finds" (so far so good): "a dynamic substance manifesting itself in action. in a thousand forms which he constantly recognizes" (p. 270, my italics). Upon the comforting and decisive phrase dynamic substance, apparently, the tougher fellows take their repose, leaving such stuff as spirit or mind for the Hegelian, or tenderer, sort. That none of us need take our differences, or our lack of progress, too deeply to heart we are assured by the author. Philosophy is a lyric "whose theme happens to be nature and destiny" (p. 324). "That the talk of philo- sophers should differ is for exactly the same reason that the speech of poets differs." In this Professor Edman is at one with the logical positivists and their kin who hold that philosophy ought to be published, "not in Mind but in the London Mercury." If philosophy is not something more astringent, precise, and critical-if less charming-than it appears to be in this version, then he and they may very well be right. But my own worthless opinion is that they are alike wrong. Agreeing that there are perennial types of philosophy, must we not trace these not to diverse aesthetic and/or temperamental 214</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS attitudes primarily, but in principle to alternative intellectual attitudes and approaches, coupled with various basic valuations. Professor Edman recog- nizes the several ways of philosophy because at bottom none of them are really philosophical, that is to say logical. He has, when all is said, no trust whatsoever in reason. For a different animal than ourselves the laws of logic might (or probably would, vide pp. 249 ff.) be different. But such biologic, seemingly intelligible to those of the Dewey tradition, seems meaningless to many others, for whom it needs no argument to show that the principles of reason, whatsoever these may be, must hold for "all rationals." Genetic accounts of the growth and organic connections of reason bear in no wise upon its nature where it is admitted to be present. Such sentences as "thinking is not a static contemplation but a process of experimental control . a process among the processes of nature" (p. 249) give no loophole by which thought can elude its own laws. We may think about different things, and with differing hypotheses or postulates; we may 'think more of' (i.e. value differently) this or that; but if we think at all we can only think in the same way. It is not modest (in Professor Edman or anyone else) to depreciate human reason; it is unmeaning. The author of course may reply that such opinions merely dub his reviewer an adherent of logical faith, a rationalist: to which the rejoinder would seem to be that all philosophy without exception is an activity of logical faith. This the author very likely would not deny; but his faith does waver in a fashion no more compatible with philosophic naturalism than with idealism. RALPH E. STEDMAN. Philosophy in America from the Puritans to James. By P. R. ANDERSON and M. H. FISCH. (New York and London: D. Appleton-Century Co. I939. Pp. xiii + 570. Price I8s. net.) An unusually wide significance must be assigned to the title of this volume, because it actually outlines, within the period indicated, "the main currents of American thought in its philosophical expressions." It includes, therefore, several thinkers who, as the authors themselves point out, "would hardly be designated 'philosophers' to-day." There must, in fact, be few readers familiar with the names of Urian Oakes and Cadwallader Colden, despite their exquisite Dickensian quality. This, however, clearly exhibits the powerful formative influence exercised here, as throughout the entire history of philo- sophy in its stricter sense, by political and social conditions, exaggerated though this principle has been by the current Marxist over-emphasis on purely economic factors. American History, too, then, amply justifies our parodying a well-known proverb-that "controversy is the mother of metaphysics"; while some para- doxical Genetics involves that the more strenuous the parent, the subtler is her offspring. This becomes increasingly evident in following the advance from the first of the four eras dealt with-that of Colonial Thought-through the Age of Reason, succeeded by Transcendentalism and Evolution, to its final stage described by the more non-committal title, The Emergence of Contemporary Issues. Probably the difficulties of selection explain the mere quartette of the later period-Peirce, Harris, Royce, and James; but it is undeniable, in my opinion, that the second of these fully deserves this some- what belated recognition. A further consideration has been the inclusion of material hitherto inaccessible, as in the cases of Benjamin Rush and Thomas Cooper. 215</page></plain_text>
