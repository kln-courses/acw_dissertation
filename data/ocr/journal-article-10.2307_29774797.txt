Freeman, 1992. $13.95. This is another in the series of expand? ed and annotated collections of Martin Gardner's columns from Scientific Ameri? can. I was one of the (many) readers who grieved when Gardner retired from writ? ing his monthly column. His successors have been interesting, even excellent, but could never take his place. For many years, when each issue arrived I would hastily scan through the magazine to see what articles were presented, and then turn to "Mathematical Recreations" to find some new challenge, puzzle or oddi? ty. Gardner took me into areas of math about which. I knew nothing and made them seem both fascinating and accessi ble. He even showed me new things in ar? eas that I thought I knew well. In the series of books that reprint these columns, Gardner has appended the read? ers' responses, their answers to puzzles, and also some additional material on the various topics that was not available when the original was written. This makes the coverage of topics more complete, at the risk of allowing lazy readers to turn to the answers instead of having to figure things out for themselves. At one time it seemed to me that a reordering of the columns into books in which the topics were more related would make them more useful, but I have since come to be? lieve that it is the very diversity of the top? ics, which pulls the reader in a variety of directions and stretches the range of thought, that is one of the books' signifi? cant assets. Personally, I am glad to have these columns available in book form. The mate? rial is timeless, although a surprising num? ber deal with "hot topics" of current re? search. Gardner always displays a skill for finding subjects that are both interesting and deep, and for many readers he was able to provide the first introduction to topics, such as knot theory, fractals (and the now ubiquitous Mandelbrot set), buckyballs and cellular automata.
