<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Animal Studies Group, Killing Animals (Urbana: University of Illinois, 2006), viii +215 pp., illus., $50, $25 paper. The purpose of reviewing Killing Animals for this journal may not be to point out its overall significance to historians of biology, but it does deserve our attention for the ways the essays in this collection demand analysis from the perspective of our specialty. The authors want to be known as "The Animal Studies Group" and include specialists from</page><page sequence="2">184 BOOK REVIEW fields such as literary criticism, philosophy, cultural studies, anthro? pology, geography, and English literature. Not a well-defined disci? plinary list, to say the least, but multidisciplinary and perhaps even interdisciplinary in practice. The most valuable essay in the collection comes from geographer Chris Wilbert, who discusses the question of why animals attack hu? mans. He examines the question in cases where the human tragedy becomes overshadowed by a fascination with the details and drama of people who lose their dominant status among animals. After treading some familiar ground in natural history museums (explored previously by Hanna Rose Shell, Ron Rainger, and Donna Haraway, among others), Wilbert builds the case that animals have responded to humans differently when the relationship between human society, natural landscapes, and wilderness shifts abruptly. He highlights famous examples; interestingly, most have been made into Hollywood movies. Just when I thought he might stop short of discussing Alfred Hitch? cock's The Birds (1963), that famous fiction of Bodega Bay avifauna too entered the analysis. An update to this essay would surely include mention of Steve "The Crocodile Hunter" Irwin's fateful encounter with a stingray. As a final example, Wilbert notes the contribution of scientists who have attempted to understand cougar behavior in terms of cougar perspective on expansive human land use. What seems a revolutionary experimental turn might better be explained through the history of animal behavior, such as we know it from the likes of Richard Burkhardt, Jr., Gregg Mitman, or Mark Borello. Other interesting essays in the volume include Erica Fudge's expli? cation of the complexity of attitudes toward animals in the early modern period and Garry Marvin's examination of hunting. Fudge explores English literature to find the diversity of views on animal lives. She finds visions of animals that are not solely emotional or anthropomorphic, but instead are based on the emerging ethics and philosophy of late sixteenth-century British culture. Fudge finds early connections, then, to natural philosophy and makes sense of the natural history of Edward Topsell, Robert Cleaver, and Joseph Hall. Her primary focus is to challenge Keith Thomas's prevailing thesis from Man and the Natural World (1983) by expanding the analysis to include the shift toward a new natural history. Historians of biology should be gratified to find these connections explored in broader historical theses. In another essay, Marvin separates hunting, where humans pursue animals for sport either through pageantry or stealth, from pr?dation, extermination, or subsistence. He connects his examination of the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 185 practice to arguments put forward in philosophy, literature, and anthropology, to name a few. The book's conclusion, an essay the Group struggled to envision from the very beginning of their collaboration, takes the form of a transcript from a roundtable held in 2003. Each contributor comments briefly on the essays, as each essay is considered in turn. They tend to agree on the broad claims of each. The reader is left without a clear sense of how it all relates, which might have been too much to hope for from the start. Historians of biology can look to this collection as both an example of the promise of multidisciplinary perspective and a model for how such a perspective can fall short of more interdisciplinary goals. While it is beyond the scope of this review to say how effectively these authors achieve their interdisciplinary goals within the realm of postmodern criticism, it seems clear enough that their neglect of scientific work and the history of scientific contexts for such work can be read as a call for inclusion of what historians of biology are best poised to contribute. As such, we can read these essays with interest, confident that we have much to learn and even more to share. Chris Young Alverno College</page></plain_text>
