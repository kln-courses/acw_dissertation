<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rita Laura Segato Okarile: Yemoja's Icon Tune' Introduction: The Sango Cult The Sango cult of the city of Recife, capital of the Northeast state of Pernambuco, is a possession cult formed with cultural elements brought to Brazil by African slaves. People refer to it also as Candomble, and there are similar religious cults in other Brazilian cities like Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Sao Luis do Maranhao, and Belem, among many others. Some fundamental aspects of the cult that are relevant to my analysis are summarized as follows: (a) Each member of the cult is said to have a god of the pantheon-an orixa, or santo, so-called saint-as a guide, patron, or "owner of the head," and a secondary god, or ajuntd, to help, accompany, or complement the first one. Through initiation, the formal ascription of a particular pair of patrons is ritualized, and the individual becomes a "child" of the ascribed gods. Accordingly, all members are considered to befilhos de santo (children of saint), or "children" of the different saints that could be chosen to serve in this role of patronage. (b) Each god is represented as an ideal anthropomorphic type with a typical behavior indicating a defined personality, a characteristic physical shape, and associated attributes of color, gastronomic tastes, material symbols, and dress. All these deities relate to each other as members of a family and are associated with particular family roles (Segato 1985, 1986). (c) Each god has a specific repertoire of songs and one or more charac- teristic patterns of drumming. Each repertoire is considered by the folk to be distinguishable from the others by the mood conveyed in its performance and by the emotions and feelings it awakens in people (even if, for some time, I was unable to identify particular formal characteristics peculiar to each repertoire).

Yemoja Icon Tune (d) Each god is said to manifest through possession, normally during the performance of his or her specific repertoire, in a recognizable fashion, dancing with an idiosyncratic pattern of movements. Therefore, behaviour during possession is, as in the case of the Yoruba, nmodelled on the tradi- tional picture of the personality' of the orixd who baixou "came down." (e) People having the same saint as "owner of their head" are considered to share common personality traits. This study explores the mirror relationship existing between the field of music and the cultural construction of human personality types. The rela- tionship originates, as in the already classical case of Kaluli music and ornithology, from the transfer of several items grouped in one semantic field to items of another semantic field so that the items and the fields stand to each other in systematic metaphor. (Feld 1981: 26) As an example of this correspondence, I will focus on the tune called "Okarile," from the repertoire dedicated to Yemoja, the goddess of the sea, showing, on one side, how Yemoja's personality traits constitute a language (a theory in Feld's sense; Ibidem: 38) to describe music and, at the same time, how music constitutes a language with which to speak of human behaviour. In the case of this particular song, I will call this relation iconic, since both descriptor and object share the same formal composition. Before going any further, I will characterize very briefly the role played by ritual music within the context of the cult's life. The pantheon stands for the social community of the cult as a sort of cognitive plan that equipped members with the mental apparatus to survey the human environment (Segato 1984: 573-76). By the same token, the saint's musical repertoires, played one after the other in rituals and particularly during the public festivals called "toques," constitute a musical plan in which every single person, through the experience of affinity with another, finds his or her place within a community of others. Blacking (1983) has argued that musical performance plays a funda- mental role in creating and reinforcing patterns for the expression of self within the context of other selves. According to him, music, through affect, serves to articulate and represent relationships among the different layers of categories that compose Venda society: self, community, and nation (Blacking 1983). This approach can also illuminate the role of music in the Sango cult, where the metaphysical community of the orixdas is symbolized in ritual by their musical repertoires. Music actualizes the equivalence between deities and individuals. Therefore, through music, the filhos de santo (children of saint) mirror themselves in that supernatural community of saints and constantly emerge from the experience of ritual with a re- newed sense of self and community identity.</page><page sequence="3">Rita Laura Segato : 3 Clifford Geertz has suggested that different societies talk about art by using different metaphors and at the same time address idiosyncratic "preoccupations" (1978: 1479) with their works of art. So, he recommends "an investigation of signs . . . in their natural habitat" (Ibidem: 1498) to determine "the meaning of things for the life that surrounds them" (Ibidem: 1499). In fact, when asked to talk about music, members frequently answered by saying, "I think of myself," or "I remember myself," when listening to particular tunes of their saints' repertoires. They also explained that they remembered particular persons, either absent or dead, as well as anecdotes, events, or even dreams involving other members of the cult who, in some cases, might have lived generations before, whenever specific tunes of the different repertoires were sung. From the accounts gathered, it became evident that, during toques, a large network of relationships constituted by those absent or dead was gradually recalled, in the minds of those present, by singing the repertoires. In one special case, an informant told me that every time she heard the tune corresponding to the orixd of her very old "mother of saint" (leader), Orisanla, she thought of the imminence of her "mother of saint's" death: I remember my mother, I feel at the same time joy and sadness, and what I remember is something that is going to happen: God protect us the day she closes her eyes! Sango cult tunes act as reminders of self, as self-related symbols, in an environment where the existential status of self constitutes a preoccupation, a central motive of the culture. By stirring up self-related emotions, music enhances personal identity and self-esteem. On the other hand, music acts as an active reminder of particular others, and establishes a frame of reference for the constitution of a community otherwise scattered in space and time, historically exposed to disruptive forces. It projects past and future onto the ideal plan in which the atemporal, immutable community of saints perennially lives. By means of music, memories of others and of the events in which they participated are systematically stimulated, giving people a sense of continuity through past, present and future, and provid- ing them with an historical perspective of the cult. The tunes, carefully preserved and repeated over generations, like the stones of the personal saints, are the permanent anchors of self and other selves in this urban, everchanging context. Finally, writing on ethnic identity, Epstein (1978) acknowledges that ethnicity provides a set of categories for social classification, but criticizes the approach of some authors (for example, Barth 1969) who ignore the subjective content of those categories and reduce them to only a necessary resultant of interaction across boundaries (this had been previously hinted at by Blacking 1977). To understand the content of identity categories, he</page><page sequence="4">4 : Okarile: Yemoja s Icon Tune recommends that we focus on their affective dimension, on the emotional charge associated with them, and he proposes a "social anthropology of affect," that would take into consideration the emotional dimension of human behaviour and particularly of identity. According to him, the con- tent of identity resides in the subjective emotional involvement of the self with the category objectively ascribed to it. In the case of the Sango cult, the self becomes deeply rooted in its ascribed category-the orixd or saint "owner of the head"-after initiation, and its affiliation is constantly re- called and strengthened by a set of affective symbols, mainly the music. As already mentioned, the main musical event is the public festival called toque. This long ritual takes place at night and usually lasts four or five hours. During its course, the repertoires of all the orixds are sung in a set order and the musical event settles the boundaries of the ritual event. It is a musical ritual, where music is the dominant system of symbols. The toque is solely intended as a celebration, usually to mark the conclusion of an important series of offerings, and the orixds are expected to "come down" in possession to enjoy themselves dancing and leave their messages. In it, more than in any other ritual, the juxtaposed relationship between indi- viduals and their saints and the relationship between the whole community of individuals and the whole community of saints is present. The mood of each saint is more fully achieved in toques than in offerings, because in toques all the saints' repertoires are sung, therefore displaying in a limited space and time the whole system of ideas associated with the orixds. In this way, the contrast of each character and its musical representation with the others proves distinctive and unique. All the repertoires are sung in responsorial style, and in most songs the "father or mother of saint," for example, the leader of the cult group, is the soloist. If the leader is tired, old or ill, she or he may be helped by another experienced priest or priestess or by a good singer, who then leads the sing- ing of some tunes. When in a state of possession, the solo part can also be sung by the "child of saint" to whom the song belongs. Each repertoire consists of an average of twenty-five or thirty songs grouped in "series." Each series consists of tunes that follow each other without interruption and are accompanied by the same drumming pattern. This qualification defines the series. When a melody that requires another rhythmic pattern is sung, a new series begins. There are rarely more than ten tunes in a series. The first series of each repertoire is usually fixed, but only in the case of Orisanla, the last saint to be addressed, is the finishing series fixed; the order in which all of the other series are sung varies from one toque to another. It is not necessary to sing all the tunes or all the possible series of the repertoires on every occasion. Normally, more songs are sung from the repertoire of the saint to whom the festival is being dedicated.</page><page sequence="5">Rita Laura Segato : 5 New tunes are not composed by Sango members, and only very rarely is a new tune added to a repertoire. When this happens, it is never con- sidered to be composed by a member, but by the saint who possesses the member. I heard of only two cases of "children of saint" who, while com- pleting their initiation rituals, sang tunes that were hitherto unknown, at least in Recife. In both cases, the tune was immediately incorporated into the respective saint's repertoire, and considered to belong to the personal saint of the "child." The absence of composition determines that every tune is preserved very much as a sacred object. Therefore tunes, like the stones of the saints, are also imbued with the symbolism of continuity in time and associated with the stability of the cult as a consolidated community. During the concluding initiation rituals called '"yawo's departure" (saida de Iyawo), the saint of the possessed "child" sings a tune which, from that moment, becomes his or her own tune. Apart from this tune, the saints of particular individuals are often said to have a special preference for one or two other tunes of the appropriate repertoire and they show this by actually "arriving" to possess the "child" when those tunes are played or by causing the possessed "child" to move more expressively. Distant or dead "children of saint" are always evoked in association with tunes that their saints pre- ferred or tunes that their saints had sung at their 'Iyaw6's departure." Some tunes of each repertoire are said to have "great appeal" (chama) and to be more powerful in "calling" for "children of the saint" to be possessed. It is in the performance of those strongly appealing tunes that each reper- toire reaches its appropriate mood, its own particular expressive climax, and drummers and singers keep repeating them for a longer period of time than other tunes. But, in general, all songs act as conventional signs whose referents are the orixas. This led Roger Bastide to describe Candomble songs as the leit-motiv of the saints (Bastide 1978: 23). Defining the relationship between particular songs and the repertoires to which they belong presents the same sort of problem as establishing a relationship between a person and his or her saint. The question is how to recognize the style of a saint's repertoire in each of its tunes and how to recognize the personality of a particular orixd in each of his or her "children." In both operations the same kind of "thinking" is manifest. In fact, persons and songs are concrete instances of the ideal sets that consist respectively of the saints and the repertoires. The repertoire of songs of a particular saint, like the personality of the saint itself, is a concept to which people attribute an overall character and the power to awake a particular range of emotions. But each performance of a song belonging to a repertoire, as each person, is unique. To emphasize this, great care is taken not to repeat a tune in any repertoire during the same ritual. Considering that up to a hundred and fifty or more short and similarly structured tunes may be sung in a single night, the fact that not a single one of them is ever repeated</page><page sequence="6">6 : Okarile: Yemoja s Icon Tune becomes significant. Singularity is stressed in music as individuality within a common humanity; but at the same time, tunes, as "individuals," receive their identity by being referred to the repertoire or saint to which they belong. Some songs are considered to be particularly representative in much the same way as some individuals are considered to be most like a particular saint in character. Moreover, different songs illuminate partial aspects of the repertoire much in the same way particular individuals exhibit only some features of the saint to which they belong. During the whole of a toque, twelve different patterns of drumming are played. Of these, one pattern is played in all the repertoires, the Nago rhythm, which significantly shares the name of the nation to which the cult belongs and gives unity to the toque as a musical event. Although several different drumming patterns are used for the music of each orixd, there are certain rhythms that are specific to particular deities or at least characteristic of them. I call a rhythm "characteristic" of a saint when, though played in more than one repertoire, people said that a given saint showed a syste- matic preference for dancing to it during possession, and it was mostly featured in that saint's repertoire. I consider a rhythm "specific" to a saint when it is played only in the repertoire of that saint (a comprehensive analysis of the structure of repertoires and drumming patterns can be found in Segato 1984). The orisa as a musical idea In every performance, each repertoire reaches its most representative moment in due time, and within particular repertoires each series achieves its character. In fact, various social and ideational factors converge during performance so that the repertoires do not start with a climax but rather reach it, and they do not start with a coherent musical impact but achieve it as the singing and the drumming come gradually together. In order to describe accurately what happens during the complex sets of performances that make up a toque, terms like "addressing" and "recall- ing" can be used to refer to the musical experience, and "enacting" for the dance. In fact, the people of the cult address, through each repertoire, a being who is conceived as dwelling in a supraordinate dimension and whose presence, at some stage in the singing of that repertoire, has to be brought about (through spirit possession) by means of music. This signifies that the temperament of that being has to be somehow expressed in music, and each musical performance consists of an always fresh collective search for the experience of concrete contact with each ideal personality model. With the progression of each repertoire's singing and drumming, the climax is</page><page sequence="7">Rita Laura Segato : 7 gradually approached; people begin to feel certain that they are contemplat- ing religious ideas musically, and that they are, in and through music, face to face with the orixd. Euphoria takes over and it is then that most posses- sions occur. At that moment, the nature of the orixd who is being addressed has finally saturated sound and can be sensed in the shape of the music. This process of approaching each orixd during the course of his or her repertoire is also reproduced on a smaller scale in the singing of each series. At the beginning of each series, the tension between individual and com- munity can be heard in the initial loose adjustment between singers them- selves, and between singers and drummers. In the terms used by informants, each series "starts slowly and gradually warms up." The intermediaries between the unifying but initially elusive reality of orixd and the singers are the drummers. People explain that "through the drummers' hands the orixds come," and the drummers say that "by remembering the orixd one recalls the pattern." Drummers launch musically the actualization of the ideal nature of the orixds. A Yemoja's song: Interpretative Anthropology and Music Having put forward a general outline of ritual as a musical event, I shall now come to the particular concern of this article, which is the examination of a representative tune of one of the repertoires involved to shed light on one kind of relationship existing between musical and non-musical ideas. I refer particularly to religious ideas as well as ideas about personality within the context of a typology of individual behavioral profiles. Such a typology is constantly implemented by members to survey the human environment. In so doing, I expressly adhere to Feld's proposition of a "broader aim" for ethnomusicological research as being the construction of "a symbolic interpretation that shows how expressive modalities are culturally constituted by performance codes that both actively communi- cate deeply felt sentiments and reconfirm mythic principles" (Feld 1982: 14). Yemoja's tune "Okarile" is consensually considered by members of the cult as the most idiosyncratic piece of that saint's repertoire. Besides this, it is accompanied by the drumming pattern known as "Gege of seven strokes" (Gege de sete pancadas). This rhythm is characteristic of Yemoja's repertoire as well and can be practically considered to be specific of it because, outside YemojaS repertoire, it is only played in one series of Oxu- mare"s repertoire. Oxumare is almost a forgotten orixd in Recife's cult; she does not "come down" in possession or has "children of saint" under her patron- age, so, it is possible to state that the "Okarile"' tune accompanies only the possession of Yemoja. Guided by the way the song "Okarile" is manifestly perceived by members</page><page sequence="8">8 : Okarile: Yemoja Icon Tune of the cult in the light of myth, I shall show how the features of the mythical character of Yemoja and of "the children of saint" under her patronage correspond to the musical features of the song in such a manner that the latter can be said to be an icon or musical allegory of the former. To sup- port this assertion, I shall start by introducing at this stage of the argument a few definitions of the term "icon." According to the Oxford English Dic- tionary, "icon" stems from the Greek "ikon" or "eikon," symbolizing 'like- ness, image, portrait, semblance, similitude, simile." In the Eastern Ortho- dox Church, it refers to "a representation of some sacred personage, in painting, bas-relief, or mosaic, itself regarded as sacred, and honoured with a relative worship or adoration." In this basic definition, the relation- ship between iconic representation and religious experience is already present. Icons were also "allegorical images" (cf. Gombrich 1948) that, during the whole Renaissance period, pictorically represented ideas, values, and disciplines of knowledge, such as death, fortune, wisdom, justice, history, and mathematics, among others, as true embodiments of them. In an article in which he explores Charles S. Pierce's classification of signs as symbols, indexes, and icons, Burks defines the icon as a represen- tation of an object that exemplifies or exhibits the structure of the object in some respects as, for instance, in the case of an onomatopoetic word, "because the sound of the word suggests or exhibits the sense" (1949: 674). Moreover, Burks observes that "the original definition of an icon as a sign which exhibits its object to an interpretant . . . implies that a sign is not iconic unless the interpretant recognizes that is such (1949: 674)." Besides this, any icon is the result of a choice of a number of qualities and relations of the structure that is to be exhibited, leaving other qualities and relations to be expressed conventionally. Hence, there are no pure icons; all of them are symbols at the same time. According to this, a pure icon would be an exact reproduction of the object, an incarnation of the object itself. In order to assess my initial description of the song "Okarile" as an icon, I shall start by characterizing the composition of the object it is meant to reproduce, that is, the components of the complex idea embodied by the deity Yemoja, which are said by the people of the cult to be also present in the sound patterns of the tune. Members' own statements about Yemoja as an orixd as well as a category of people identified with that orixa, recorded during informal conversations or in the course of interviews, seem par- ticularly expressive. In the first place, concerning the status and sea-like quality of Yemoja: Yemoja is the saint to whom all the others have to come: they must pay homage to Her because She is the mother, for that reason alone, even if She never did anything to deserve it.</page><page sequence="9">Rita Laura Segato : 9 People say that Yemoja is false. And they also say that She is the Queen of the sea. . . . we know that while the sea itself may appear quiet at first sight, and it may seem pleasant around the place where you are bathing, underneath the surface it is dragging you into the depths. When you see a wave coming on the surface, there is another underneath the surface pulling you towards the depths. Probably, that is why, at the same time, Yemoja gives with one hand and takes with the other. Then Her nostalgia: Yemoja' "children" are very attached to their memories; things that affect them, either pleasant or painful, always stay in their minds. They are con- stantly reminiscing, looking back into the past, remembering distant things: pure, beautiful memories, and they feel that distant things are still close to them [here, there is an allusion to Africa, and to the sea which separated the slaves from the motherland]. "Children" of Yemoja are very humble, very compassionate. They cry easily. Her proverbial falseness: There is an aspect of falseness in Yemoja s life and in the life of Her "children." They are deceitful. Most of Yemojas "children," not necessarily all, are two-faced, guileful. Some of them may be talking with you, and entertaining at the same time a thousand treacherous thoughts. Everything they say to you may be false. They may have good qualities, but the main thing is this-they are not frank. A "child" of Yemoja is unable to reveal his feelings of dislike towards you. It is difficult to notice "children" of Yemoja' wrongs: they act in a very con- cealed way; they are very discreet, they are always detached, listening; they do not get involved. "Children" of Yemoja may seem to share your sorrow, but then they may be laughing at you behind your back. You cannot read their minds: they are false. Many of them are unable to have true feelings. Some of them are false, but not necessarily all. A false "child" of Yemoja is a real danger, because they appear so friendly: getting on well with you, kissing you, being affectionate towards you, while they may in fact be slandering you behind your back. You can never really work out what is actually taking place in their minds. They are tranquil, docile, displaying the same apparent meekness throughout their lives. They seem trustworthy but they may behave in an unexpectedly false man- ner. Their appearance may be very deceiving. They pretend to be good and control themselves to appear constantly kind, and they may be good, but the fact is that you cannot see how they really are because their behaviour is not transparent. They have a special appeal because they know how to use</page><page sequence="10">10 : Okarile. Yemoja Icon Tune appropriate words when talking and speak correctly, making you trust them because of that. But some of them may betray your confidence. They may appear to be utterly good, to be good devotees, but appearances are deceptive. They may offer you lots of inducements, making you believe that they are generous, but then they disappoint you, so you realize that the first impression they gave you was false: they had sought you for their own self-interest. They are scheming. I'm a typical Yemoja. People assign Yemoja to me at first sight. I appear to be very calm, and people say that I do things "under the counter," that I act covertly. Though I do not think I do, and I do not think that I am calm. and duplicity: On the one hand, they look very calm, very humble but, on the other hand, behind that humility and good manners, they are very arrogant. They behave in such a way that you never get to perceive what they are thinking of you. They act with such convincing politeness! Yemoja is melancholic, but She may be ferocious as well. A woman like Her, a fish-woman, who dwells in the depths of the sea, has to be ferocious, has to have authority for all those fish not to devour Her. She is a mermaid, a mixed being: half woman-half fish; so a shark or any one of those big fish of the sea may devour Her, but She has survived for centuries because She has au- thority. In this sense, She has beauty, on the one hand, but on the other hand, She dominates. She is the Queen of the sea, She rules over the fish. She has that strong domineering personality, but at the same time, She keeps Her soft manner, Her feminine wiles. Her tranquility: People of Yemoja are calm, they never become rebellious; they are patient. "Children" of Yemoja are tranquil, restful, very slow. They seem to be always tired, and are generally dull and lifeless. They have no spark. They carry on being somewhat overcautious, giving an appearance of humility. They are very lazy, and may have a job and go to work every day, but they are never ready to make any extra effort. They may work and keep a stable, routine job all their life, but they are generally lazy. You can see the typical lassitude of Yemoja and Her "children." They always look tired. They may have very slow responses. That is why some people say that the "children" of Yemoja are bored, apathetic people; it means that the person is not ready for anything at any time. "Children" of Yemoja are as calm as the sea, and as in the case of the sea, it is not possible to know what lies beneath the surface.</page><page sequence="11">Rita Laura Segato : 11 People say of us, "children" of Yemoja, that we are false, talk too much, are cold-hearted, meek, dull, and very slow; that we never hurry up, even if you are dying and we are attempting to save you: I do not think I am bad or false; I feel I am humane; though, I may be cold-hearted in certain respects. Yemoja is mother, so people say that She feels superior: I do not feel superior to anybody. People say I am too self-assured: I am not self-assured, I am calm. and unpredictability: 'Children" of Yemoja are prone to deliver an unexpected blow. Their behaviour is like that of the waves of the sea-unpredictable. They are calm, but when the occasion arrives they respond by kicking you. You may observe that the sea is calm but, then, it suddenly becomes turbulent. That is the quality of the sea. "Children" of Yemoja are apparently serene, but deeply in their hearts they are not. You believe they are good until you disturb them. You see them sitting quietly before you, but should you go and do something they dislike, that calm is suddenly transformed into a storm, a tidal wave, a rough sea. They are moody. We, people of Yemoja, do not live continually showing our strength, our fury; we are normally humble, kind, and tender people. Yet, it is true that the "children" of Yemoja have a peaceful appearance but are bad-tempered, in that sense, they may deceive. "Children" of Yemoja are not straightforward. They may be very rude and react disagreeably when someone upsets them. They will say nasty things; they know how to respond with aggressive, hurtful words to destroy the opponent. They suddenly respond with harsh manners. They may get upset just because of a mere triviality, and insult you verbally or reprimand you fiercely. They are critical and admonishing and they are prone to get rid of people in a brusque way. But immediately after this, it is as if nothing had happened. They are not vivacious, but they are cunning and wily. Having characterized these ideas, I shall now refer to the song "Okarile"' in which, according to the native perception, all the features described by the statements above are musically represented, starting by the pattern of drumming that provides the rhythmic basis for it: Gege rhythm + seven strokes J.

This combination of ternary and binary beats starting with four exactly equal, regular cells, produces a sense of abrupt- ness, unexpected change in every repetition of the pattern, which people compared with the contrast between the even manners and placid appearance of Yemoja and Her sudden outbursts and unpredictable behaviours. There- fore, the iconic principle can be already identified in the rhythmic basis of the song. When coming to the combination of melody and drumming (see tran- scription below), the picture becomes more complex and elaborate. The melody is fluid, flowing quite freely in relation to the steady, though ir- regular, rhythmical motive repeated again and again by the drums. This is heard clearly as an onomatopoeia for navigation. The component of detachment and the component of distance and the resultant longing, sense of loss, and nostalgia present in the idea of Yemoja are, according to the "folk view," also present in the progressive detachment between singing and drumming. In fact, members called my attention to the fact that during the course of the performance of the song, drummers step up the tempo, producing an ever increasingly rhythmic density, while the singers keep the melody at roughly the same pace or even slower, producing just the opposite effect. The result of these two contrary movements is that, in relative terms, taking as a reference the strokes of the drumming, the long notes in the melody become longer and longer, sharpening the contrast between the melodic and the rhythmic lines. The perception of detachment and distance in musical terms evokes the idea of detachment and longing in character. According to the native view, this musical effect contains and renders manifest a nostalgia for distant lands or events characteristic of Yemoja. This effect is also associated with the distance that slaves traveled by sea and which today separates their descendants from Africa, the progressive distance that navigation by sea interposed between Africa, a mythical homeland and the land of daily existence. Another strong component of Yemoja's image is Her dull, calm, slow, and melancholic personality. Members pointed to what could be translated as a general legato character of the melody with its lack of stressed notes, the abundance of long notes, and the long internal rests on notes other than the tonic as the sonic realization of those attributes. Moreover, people warned that, focusing on the drumming, the tune could be heard as a</page><page sequence="16">16 : Okarile: Yemoja Icon Tune 'hot tune" ("uma toada quente'), while focusing on the singing a slow litany could be heard. This disjunction between the movement of both lines was related to the divorce between depth and surface so charac- teristic of the deity. Yemoja, the sea and the song were conceived to share this same quality, that is, the appointed lack of accordance between ap- pearance and inner reality that won Yemoja the adjective of false, not transparent. Following this line of reasoning, members compared the gege of seven strokes, a combination of crossed, irregular accents that cut through the flow of the melody, to the sudden turbulence that lies hidden in the depth of the sea, masked by its peaceful surface. One is taken by surprise, people said, if one suddenly turns the attention from the singing to the drumming; the song reveals itself so unpredictable and treacherous as Yemoja and the sea. In short, constitutive elements of the structure of Yemoja as an image and as a culturally constructed idea, such as Her sense of loss, Her tranquility, Her falseness, and Her unpredictable, brusque responses, are all exhibited and self-evident without mediation through the tune as a structure of sound. This is so, provided that one learns how to hear the tune from the perspective of the tradition, musical and cultural, and assents to the guide- lines for hearing a song hinted at by those who are insiders of that tradition. From that point of view, a true anthropology of music not only focuses on musical performance and its product but holds, in the cultural construction of hearing, the key to understanding (concerning this point see also Black- ing 1974). In 1984 I suggested that Platonic metaphysics founded on consistent relationships between the world of "ideas" and their earthly instances could be fruitfully used to describe the existing relationships between saints and their "children." In fact, I maintain that the orixds are ideas or archetypes that become accessible through renewed versions or manifestations. Their revelation occurs in music, particularly when the performance of their repertoires reach a climax in the most representative rhythms and tunes, as well as in the set of patterned movement that indicates the presence of each orixa through possession. In an article about 'Icones Symbolicae" during the Renaissance, Gom- brich points out that the "conception of revelation through symbolism . . . gains new importance . . . with the revival of Neo-Platonism" (1948, 167). For the Neo-Platonists True knowledge only results from .. intellectual intuition of ideas or essences . . . and ... in our lives ... we can only hope to achieve this true knowledge in the rare moments when the soul leaves the body in a state of ecstasis, such as may be granted us through divine frenzy (1948, 171).</page><page sequence="17">Rita Laura Segato : 17 Here, intuition is presented as "the highest form of knowledge" and, according to Gombrich, this idea of intuition '"merges with the doctrine of revelation through visual symbols." "For in the visual symbol we also con- template the whole of a proposition in a flash" (1948, 171). It is clear that this author privileges vision and gives exclusivity to visual images as the only elements capable of abolishing "our rational division between 'form' and 'content'" (p. 177), that is, of constituting iconic em- bodiments of ideas. However, my point here is that ideas may not only 'look like" but also "sound like." This must be so, in particular, for a society where material symbols, painted, sculptured, or other, underwent at least two violent processes of destruction: first, during the long centuries of slavery, and more recently during the police repression of Afro-Brazilian cults in the 1930s. No wonder, therefore, that iconic symbolization had to draw from and take refuge in the redoubt of the non-material (at least not solid), more ethereal forms like patterns of sound. In the case of the Sango cult, "Okarile" is not the only example of a musical icon. Others, such as the "Alojd" and "Gege" patterns of drumming contrasting with each other, ex- hibit musically the ideas associated with the confronted orixas Sango and Ogum, respectively. I would like to conclude by emphasizing the value of anthropological contributions in the understanding of music. The significative elements in a song can only be identified and interpreted in the light of knowledge of the system of ideas, beliefs, and values of the group involved, dealing with culture as "a context, something within which. . . [signs] can be intelligibly . . . described" (Geertz 1975). Only such an acquaintance with the culture allows us "to hear" a song with its intention to meaning, since this "hearing" is an activity where the musical and the extra-musical cross- cut each other at the time of the semiotic operation.2 Notes 1. This paper is based on data gathered during eighteen months of research among members of orthodox cult houses of the Nago (Yoruba) tradition in the city of Recife, Brazil. Some of the materials analised here served also as data for a Ph.D. dissertation (1984). 2. In his last book, John Blacking (1987) comments on the 'Okarile" tune, as it was described and analyzed in my thesis, to put forward and ex- emplify exactly this perspective: 'The irregular metre of the song called 'Gege of seven strokes' was intended to portray the falseness and tricky</page><page sequence="18">18 : Okarile.

I would like to dedicate this text to him, who taught me how to think about music anthropologically and how to approach music through anthropology.
