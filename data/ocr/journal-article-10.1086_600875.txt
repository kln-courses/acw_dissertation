         <p>One of the striking attributes ascribed to God in the Bible, particularly in the Pentateuch, is that of jealousy (“For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God”; Exod. 20:5).1 “Jealous” (in Hebrew: <italic>qana</italic>) even serves as one of His names (“For the Lord, jealous is His name, He is a jealous God”; Exod. 34:14). It is well known that in the Bible, a name signifies something of the essence of the one who bears it.2 Repeatedly, we find warnings not to arouse the wrath of God, alongside descriptions of various incidents that culminate in His furious anger, followed by futile attempts to appease Him.3 It is no accident that there are numerous terms used for God’s anger in the Bible: <italic>ḥaron</italic>, <italic>ka‘as</italic>, <italic>qeẓef</italic>, <italic>sin’ah</italic>, <italic>za‘am</italic>, <italic>ge‘arah</italic>, <italic>nekama</italic>, and more.4 In the Bible, God’s jealousy has many aspects, and the grappling with it—of the prophets, of His people, and first and foremost of God Himself—assumes different forms.5 Many sections of the Bible, and particularly of the Pentateuch, may thus be read as a history of the Divine fury and the means of restraining it.6</p>
         <p>In this article, I wish to read the first chapters of the book of Genesis, or, more precisely, the narratives of the Creation (Genesis 1–2) and of the Flood (Genesis 6–9), as a saga at whose focus God learns, through great effort, to control and restrain His outbursts of fury. According to the interpretation to be offered below, the drama of “the mythic time” is a kind of bildungsroman, a story of education and maturation, a coming to terms: not of human beings, but of God Himself. The end result of this psychodynamic process is the creation of devices for self‐control—for restraining the Divine jealousy and fury that seem constantly ready to burst out. The narrative of the Creation and the Flood in the first chapters of the book of Genesis describes an internal process within the Divine: one that begins with the (false) consciousness of self‐wholeness (perfection?), self‐satisfaction, and euphoria, whose source lies in the illusion that the Creation as a whole—and particularly human beings, the crown of creation, who were created in God’s image—are fitting and perfect. It continues with profound disappointment due to humanity’s corruption, causing God “sadness of heart” that rapidly turns into fierce, disproportionate anger; that wishes to destroy everything and to return the world to chaos; and that concludes with God accepting and bearing His violent and impaired images. In a more profound sense, the narratives of the Creation and the Flood convey the process whereby God comes to terms with the violence and faults within Himself. This acceptance, or containing, is embodied in a new normative order that God establishes for human beings, and with a natural, (physical‐)psychological mechanism that God creates for Himself, both of which are intended to restrain His jealousy and anger.7</p>
         <p>The vocabulary of jealousy, anger, wrath, and so forth, which is extremely common in the Bible, does not appear in the story of the Creation and the Flood. But already, in the book of Isaiah, in what seems like intrascriptural exegesis, God’s mood in the chapter of the Flood is described in terms of wrath and anger: “For this is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry [<italic>mi‐kẓof</italic>] with you and will not rebuke you [<italic>mig‘or bakh</italic>]” (54:9).8 And indeed, as I shall demonstrate below, the dynamic of the Divine emotion, implied in the saga of Genesis, even though it has several unique characteristics, is extremely similar to the dynamic of God’s jealousy as repeated time and again in other chapters of the Pentateuch, which have been brilliantly analyzed by Yochanan Muffs.9</p>
         <p>The reading of the story of the Flood in Genesis proposed below is based on the widespread assumption of critical biblical scholars that chapters 1–11 (for our purposes, specifically chaps. 1–2, 5, 6–9) are composed of two different documents: the Priestly source, known as P; and a non‐Priestly source, known as the Jahwist source, or J. Although biblical scholars disagree among themselves as to whether certain fragments of verses or individual terms within these chapters originate in P or in J, there is general consensus that the unit consisting of the opening chapters of the Torah is composed of two distinct, clearly defined sources.10 The first part of this unit, chapters 1–5, is composed of two separate, independent sources: 1:1 to 2:4a and chapter 5 as a whole belong to P, whereas from 2:4b to the end of chapter 4 belong to J. From chapter 6 on—namely, the story of the Flood—the two sources have been woven together by anonymous redactors and are intertwined with each other.11 But even within this variegated and mottled textual unit, one may still distinguish P and J from each other with relative ease. At the focus of the following discussion, then, is the Flood narrative as found in the Priestly source. Along with this I shall also discuss (primarily by way of comparison) the parallel story in the Jahwist source. In the course of doing so, I shall also refer to what emerges from the combination of the two sources—that is, the activity of the Redactor (usually known as R). This viewpoint is, of course, of considerable importance, if only due to the fact that it reflects the sense of the biblical text at the time of its final redaction and as it was read throughout the generations.</p>
         <p>Biblical scholars disagree as to whether the Priestly source, considered by many to be the later of the two, is based on J or responds to it. There are others who think that P preceded J and raise similar questions in the opposite direction.12 The point of departure of the following analysis is that P and J are totally separate and independent of each other. Indeed, comparison between P and J in the story of the Creation and the Flood indicates profound and fundamental differences between them, prompting the conclusion that neither one of them depends on elements or links of the story that are unique to the other one. Nevertheless, from time to time I shall raise the possibility that the Priestly source was based on (or responded to) J, or vice versa.</p>
         <p>The opening chapters of the book of Genesis are extremely compact. It is beyond the ability of any single scholar (and certainly beyond my own power) to encompass the full range of motifs and ideas embodied therein, the manifest and hidden connections between them, and their comparison to extrabiblical myths and sources from Mesopotamia and from other cultures.13 This fact weighs upon anybody who interprets these chapters, all the more so one who attempts to write about the overall narrative. In the following, I make no pretense to comprehensiveness. All that I wish to do is shed light on one element that is, to my mind, central to the story of the Creation and the Flood and that, to my astonishment—as far as I know—has to date not been explored in the research literature and exegesis. This element combines with other aspects of these chapters, but it is also opposed to other readings thereof (a point on which I shall comment briefly below).</p>
         <p>Many of the classical exegetes—and even more so scholars in the modern period, both Jews and Christians—have refrained from seeing jealousy as an attribute of the biblical God. This explicit tendency is part of their overall tendency to deny God, that is, the biblical God, a rich, complex, and dynamic personality (persona). The reason for this is well known: such an approach is perceived as flawed, due to its rude anthropomorphism, and thus as unsuitable to the theological tendencies or biases of the exegetes and interpreters of their various schools and circles.14</p>
         <p>It was Maimonides, more than any other thinker, who neutralized the descriptions of jealousy and wrath attributed to God by the Bible.15 It is well known that Maimonides denied God not only physical attributes but also mental or psychological characteristics (i.e., abstracted from matter). In those chapters of <italic>The Guide of the Perplexed</italic> dealing with the Divine attributes, he interprets all of the personal attributes as attributes of action. “The Torah,” he implies also in this context, “spoke [i.e., about God] in the language of human beings” (i.e., in the manner in which one would describe human beings).16 Maimonides knew full well that the Bible frequently ascribes to God emotions of anger, jealousy, and revenge and therefore devotes several paragraphs to these attributes:<disp-quote>
               <p>Many of these actions would proceed from one of us in reference to another only because of a violent anger or a great hatred or a desire for vengeance. With reference to these actions he is called <italic>jealous</italic> and <italic>avenging</italic> and <italic>keeping anger</italic> and <italic>wrathful</italic>, meaning that actions similar to those that proceed from us from a certain aptitude of the soul—namely, jealousy, holding fast to vengeance, hatred, or anger—proceed from Him, may He be exalted, because of the deserts of those who are punished, and not because of any passion whatever, may He be exalted above every deficiency.17</p>
            </disp-quote>Many other thinkers followed in Maimonides’ wake, even if not with quite such an extreme formulation.18</p>
         <p>Maimonides’ exegetical approach to the Scriptures (and in his wake that of Maimonidean philosophers) is, as is well known, allegorical. Allegory, unlike metaphor, is concerned with large textual units, rich with description and complex turns of plot. Allegorical exegesis sees such texts as parable and strives to uncover its inner meaning. Unlike the external level of meaning of the Scriptures, which is almost always concrete and narrative, the level of internal significance is always theoretical and conceptual. The main elements of any concrete description or dramatic plot are transformed, in allegorical interpretation, into abstract philosophical concepts. One therefore ought not to be surprised that this method of interpretation tends to abstract and conceptualize moods and emotions, particularly when these apply to God. Moreover, as a rule, in an allegorical text the emotional motifs have no inner meaning. They serve, in the words of Maimonides, “rather to embellish the parable and to render it more coherent or to conceal further the intended meaning.”19 An interesting example of this is his interpretation of the Garden of Eden narrative (which, as mentioned earlier, is part of the Creation story in J). This interpretation, with which <italic>The Guide of the Perplexed</italic> opens, is an archetype of every allegorical interpretation (suitable to the “truth”) of the Pentateuch. This dramatic plot, in which God is a central figure, becomes for Maimonides a philosophical‐conceptual discussion of the ultimate purpose of human beings, of their intellectual perfection, and of the imagination and drives that distract or distance them therefrom. This interpretation does not ascribe any meaning or significance to the psychological complexity and emotional turns, particularly on the part of God, that are emphasized or alluded to in the narrative.</p>
         <p>The removal of jealousy from God is a widespread inclination not only among rationalistic exegetes; it also appears among thinkers and exegetes of other trends, including phenomenologists of religion in general and of biblical religion in particular. Thus, for example, Franz Rosenzweig, in a famous article in which he criticizes nineteenthcentury scholars of Jewish texts (<italic>Wissenschaft des Jüdentums</italic>) for their tendency to remove any human dimension from God, writes: “The anthropomorphism found in the Bible are all statements regarding encounters between God and man. … These anthropomorphisms [in the Bible] do not add up to an image or description [of God] but, in keeping with their concrete and immediate character, relate to a creature who is confronted and to the present moment alone.”20 According to Rosenzweig, descriptions of the Divine personality in the Bible are always descriptions of momentary and extraordinary encounters with God—who by His nature and essence is hidden (and transcendent)—on the part of unique personalities. Hence, there is not (and cannot be) therein any full and rich character description of the Godhead. In this context I ought to mention that, in terms of its literary style, the Bible (in all of its documents, notwithstanding the great differences among them) is extremely sparing in its descriptions of the personal characteristics of its heroes. But one must not confuse style with substance and contents. The biblical figures are complex, filled with tensions and contradictions, and in constant change. This statement is even more true with regard to God, who is beyond all doubt the primary hero in the narrative of both the Pentateuch and the Bible as a whole.</p>
         <p>Another example of this tendency appears in the approach of Yehezkel Kaufmann. Kaufmann, as is known, wages war against the abstract, philosophical interpretation of the Bible, which he identifies with “Greek paganism.” Kaufmann repeatedly insists that one cannot deny the God of Israel an image and personality.21 However, he draws a sharp and even extreme contrast between the biblical God and the gods of myth. The God of Israel, argues Kaufmann, is not subject to magical or psychological manipulations. Unlike the gods of Mesopotamia or Egypt, the biblical God (<italic>YHWH/Elohim</italic>), in all His manifestations, is not subject to impersonal destiny (<italic>moira, ananke</italic>). The biblical God, according to Kaufmann, is “pure will,” enjoying absolute freedom. The innovation of biblical religion, in his approach, lies in its description of a god who transcends the material realm, who is outside of nature and its restrictive laws. But unlike what one might imagine, this pure, radically free Divine will does not provide God with a clear personality, with all of the tensions, dynamics, and affections such as are known to us among human beings.22 The “Divine Will,” according to Kaufmann, is not the inner core of a persona, which fuses together a complex of feelings and tendencies; according to him, the pure Will of the biblical God is completely free of such things. This will is essentially an ethical concept, developed by Kaufmann under the inspiration of his neo‐Kantian mentor, Hermann Cohen, which he imposes upon the biblical God of Israel.23 According to Kaufmann, one cannot at all speak of God’s emotion, nor of feelings of disappointment, wrath, or calm that befall Him regularly.</p>
         <p>Another means of distancing anger from God is found in the influential book of Rudolph Otto, <italic>The Idea of the Holy</italic>.24 At first glance, Otto seems to accentuate God’s fury and jealousy. But a closer and more focused reading of his way of treating God’s jealousy in this work reveals a different and, in my view, opposite, picture. The manifestations of God’s jealousy in world religions (including biblical religion) are translated by Otto into the numinous, the <italic>mysterium tremendum</italic>, into a Godhead filled with “awesome majesty.” He sees Divine zeal as “numinous outbursts,” which God arouses within human beings, and irrational, out‐of‐this‐world fear, unfocused and unexplainable. This fear, according to Otto, is inevitably involved in any “standing before God.” According to him, “fear” or “awe” is the fundamental component of the religious experience as such; it is the inner core of the adjective “holy,” which religion—every religion—ascribes to God. The Bible, according to Otto, well expresses the nature of the religious experience and of God’s holiness, particularly by means of the motif of jealousy. Regarding the extreme expressions of jealousy attributed to God in the Bible, Otto writes as follows: “Related expressions akin to the `holiness' of Yahweh are His `fury,' His `jealousy,' His `wrath,' the `consuming fire,' and the like. The impact of them all is not only the all‐requiting righteousness of God, nor even merely His susceptibility to strong and living emotions, but all this ever enclosed in and permeated with the `awfulness' and the `majesty,' the `mystery' and the `augustness' of his non‐rational Divine nature. … God’s `livingness' is perceptibly akin to His `jealousy' and is manifested in and through this, as in His other `passions' generally.”25</p>
         <p>But Otto’s approach in fact neutralizes the mythic and personal elements within God. What appears in Otto as an emphasis upon the vitality of God is none other than an abstraction of the jealousy and fury attributed to Him by the Bible. This is indicated by the deliberately paradoxical subheading of this work: jealousy is an element of the “non‐rational factor in the idea of the Divine.” God’s vitality, His nonrationality—“perceptibly akin to His ‘jealousy’ and is manifested in and through this, as in His other ‘passions’ generally”—is an expression of the experience of His total otherness from the world and from human beings. In other words, “jealousy” embodies the transcendence of the Godhead in feeling and in experience more than in cognition and consciousness. The strangeness or otherness of God, according to Otto (in every authentic religious experience), is best embodied in the irrational, meaningless element of jealousy. Moreover, Otto mixes Divine jealousy and wrath with a whole complex of other qualities attributed to Him. He thereby obscures their distinctive qualities and prevents any engagement in His means of controlling them. Otto’s phenomenology, which is no more than a smokescreen for his own theological views, exerted tremendous influence on biblical scholars, particularly Protestant‐Christian ones, but also on Jewish scholars and exegetes.</p>
         <p>It is conventionally accepted in the study of religions to draw a distinction between anthropomorphism and anthropopathism. Anthropomorphism portrays God in many respects in human terms, including (or perhaps primarily) the physical‐bodily sense. By contrast, anthropopathism (from the word <italic>pathos</italic>, feeling) denies God having bodily characteristics but is not fazed by ascribing to Him mental characteristics such as wisdom and knowledge, love and compassion, anger and jealousy. Understandably, anthropopathism is considered by theologians and scholars of religion as a more refined type of theology. However, a careful examination of anthropopathic theological approaches quickly reveals that the personal attributes ascribed to God in these approaches are often far from adding up to a rich and complex personality structure. These characteristics are attributed to God as concepts or ideas, as abstract (and some will add: superficial and hollow) mental descriptions. According to them, God is love or will, wisdom or jealousy; these are very remote from the concrete, intricate, and dynamic will, love, and jealousy known to us from real human beings or from dense literary figures. At times it seems that the theological reticence against attributing a real personality to God—even among those adhering to an anthropopathic approach—is even greater than the reluctance to ascribe to Him a body or the image of a body.26 This should not be surprising, as from the viewpoint of various kinds of NeoPlatonic theologies, what could be more human—and more clearly non‐Divine—than a complex and dynamic “personality”?27</p>
         <p>Moreover, God’s body may be distinguished from a mortal human body by the enormous magnitude of its dimensions (such, for example, is the approach of the book <italic>Shi‘ur Qomah</italic>) or by the refinement of its material, as in Maimonides’ comments at the beginning of <italic>The Guide of the Perplexed</italic> about the anthropomorphizing multitude: “However, He [i.e., the God who has a body] is, in their view, bigger and more resplendent than they themselves, and the matter of which He is composed is not flesh and blood.”28 By this means, the masses preserved something of God’s otherness and His transcendence.29 Such is not the case with regard to personal and mental characteristics, which are more difficult to magnify or to make sublime. This distinction applies particularly to the biblical God, the “matter” of whose body is hidden and mysterious—the Bible, as is well known, says hardly anything about it—whereas His personality, from the moment one is ready to delve into it, is immediately revealed as complex and dynamic and at times also as externalized (particularly in J)—in brief, as human.</p>
         <p>As hinted earlier, the inspiration for the current study came from the pioneering essay of Muffs, “Between Justice and Mercy: The Prayers of the Prophets,” and his fragmented comments in <italic>The Personhood of God: Biblical Theology, Human Faith and the Divine Image</italic>, recently published.30 For Muffs, the revolutionary innovation of the Bible—in contrast, on the one hand, with rationalistic‐speculative theologies and, on the other, against the gods of the myths of the ancient Near East—lies in its “focus on the idea of the personhood of God.”31 Regarding the God of the (Aristotelian) philosophers, Muffs writes that “Aristotle’s god was doomed to eternal self‐contemplation. … Yet this is not so for the God of Israel. His personality finds its true expression in love for another personality, independent and outside itself. It is a great love that cannot be contained by the boundaries of the self, a love that seeks involvement of the divine heart with its human counterpart.”32 Regarding the gods of Mesopotamian and Egyptian myth, he writes that their own subjugation to nature and to transdivine destiny combines with apathy toward the human condition: “one who is completely given over to the satisfaction of his physical needs is not ready for interpersonality.”33 For that reason, Muffs claims that the personalities of the gods of ancient Near East myths were not developed.</p>
         <p>Muffs’ readings of the biblical text represent a profound shift. The difference between a reading of the biblical God in a (quasi‐)philosophical‐theological manner, and reading Him as a complex and dynamic personality, has implications for almost every subject and chapter in the Bible, particularly in the Torah. This manner of reading affects the understanding of the narrative itself, of its theology, as well as of the meaning of biblical law. At times it demands an ironical, skeptical, critical (or even humorous) attitude, both regarding its outstanding personalities (figure) and particularly in relation to God. Such an exegesis invites a certain type of “reading between the lines,” which at its best is none other than (in Muffs’ words) a reading of the written words themselves.</p>
         <p>Indeed, as Muffs hints, such a reading of the figure of God in the Bible requires the use of literary devices that assist in illuminating His personality—His feelings, hopes, frustrations, and ethical decisions. For that reason, it is rather surprising that that school dealing with the study of the Bible as literature, which helped to reveal the sophistication of the biblical authors and the complexity of the text and narratives that they created, has on the whole refrained from looking at God as a figure requiring literary analysis. This school, which emphasized the psychological and emotional complexity of the biblical heroes, failed to see God as one of its heroes. As in the case of both the classical commentators and the modern scholars, for many of the literary scholars the God of the Bible is “ultimately unknowable but ethical” and hence above literary‐psychological analytic tools.34</p>
         <p>While I shall disagree below with some of Muffs’ phenomenological distinctions and here and there suggest different interpretations than he does of specific scriptural passages, most of what I propose here is the result of his inspiration. It seems odd to me that his profound and innovative studies, although preliminary, have left hardly any impression on Bible scholars nor on historians of Jewish religion in ancient times and in late antiquity. It would appear that what I wrote earlier regarding the theological inhibitions and biases among scholars of Israelite religion in general and Bible scholars in particular, concerns about which Muffs himself comments, render his words to be ahead of their time.35</p>
         <p>One must reiterate that the claim that the biblical God ought to be read as a rich and complex personality must not be taken as implying a reduction of biblical theology to Divine psychology or emotional structures alone. The Bible incorporates theological insights that go beyond the psychological. All that is claimed here is that what makes the biblical narrative (or central parts thereof) unique is the integration and interweaving of traditional (i.e., transhuman or nonhuman) theological elements—for example, versions of sublimity and transcendence, eternity and power—with psychological and emotional elements. In my view, the manner in which these elements were interwoven with one another, and the nature of their mutual influence, is a central factor in biblical religion (discussion of which goes beyond the ken of the current study). The focus in what follows on personal theology is not intended to negate the existence of impersonal theological elements in the Bible.36</p>

               <p>See further, for example, “you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God” (Exod. 20:5), “The Lord is a jealous God and avenging; the Lord is avenging and wrathful” (Nah. 1:2), and many other like quotations. While the Torah also seemingly describes God as “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love” (Exod. 34:6), a closer reading of these verses clearly reveals that they are not a description of God’s characteristics but rather a prayer (of a quasi‐magical, manipulative nature) whose purpose is to dispel God’s anger and to calm Him at a time of wrath. On this entire subject, see Y. Muffs, “Who Will Stand in the Breach? A Study of Prophetic Intercession,” in his <italic>Love and Joy: Law, Language and Religion in Ancient Israel</italic> (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1995), 9–48.</p>

               <p>Among the striking sources concerning outbursts of anger on the part of God found in the Pentateuch are: Abraham and Sodom (Genesis 18–19), the story of the death of the sons of Aaron (Leviticus 10), the limitations placed at Mt. Sinai (“lest He break out against them”: Exod. 19:24), the incident of the Golden Calf (Exodus 32–34), the incident of <italic>Kibroth‐hatta’avah</italic> (Numbers 11), the Spies (Numbers 14), Korah (Numbers 16–17), and the story of Phineas’s zeal (Numbers 25). For warnings related to this matter, see, for example, the law of the condemned city in Deut. 13:18, the chapter of curses or imprecations (Deut. 28, 29:10–28), and the Song of Moses (Deut. 32:16–35), which is a combination of narrative and warning. The other books of the Bible are also filled with this motif. Thus, for example, the motif of God’s anger is central in the Book of Judges; see, for example, the structural exposition in Judges 2.</p>

               <p>From the mid‐nineteenth century until the mid‐1970s, there was widespread agreement among critical biblical scholars regarding the principle of the Documentary Hypothesis. From the mid‐1970s, the fundaments of this theory were attacked from a number of different directions until, toward the end of the twentieth century, this consensus almost ceased to exist. See E. Nicholson, <italic>The Pentateuch in the Twentieth Century: The Legacy of Julius Wellhausen</italic> (Oxford, 1998). In terms of our subject, notwithstanding this crisis, there continues to be agreement: most Bible scholars consider the opening chapters of Genesis (i.e., 1–11) to be composed of two sources, one Priestly and one non‐Priestly. For convenience, I shall continue to refer to the non‐Priestly source by its formerly widespread name, which is to a large extent still used today—J, or the Jahwist document. There are some scholars who challenged this distinction and argued the literary unity of Genesis 6–9 (hence also 1–11). See, for example, B. W. Anderson, “From Analysis to Synthesis: The Interpretation of Genesis 1–11,” <italic>Journal of Biblical Literature</italic> 97 (1978): 23–39; G. J. Wenham, <italic>Genesis 1–15</italic> (Nashville, 1987), 148, and the works cited there.</p>

               <p>There are numerous parallels in Mesopotamian and other mythologies to the story of the Creation, and even more so to the Flood narrative, that invite comparative study. On the Mesopotamian sources, see James B. Pritchard, ed., <italic>The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures</italic> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1959), 28–75; and W.

So as not to complicate the following discussion or expand it beyond proportion, I have refrained from suggesting comparisons to these myths. This is not to say that they are not fruitful.</p>

               <p>While Maimonides was not the first one to do so, he was the outstanding figure among them.

               <p>This is one of the meanings of this expression in Maimonides. Another meaning is: “The Torah spoke [of God] in the language of human beings.” This exegetical tendency truncates speech about God and every characterization of His personality relating to some other matter, and His numerous attributes never combine into one single, full, and complete image. Any reference to God is a kind of metaphor that stands in its own right.</p>

               <p>See Cherbonnier, “The Logic of Biblical Anthropomorphism.” The criticism has been lodged against the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic approaches that the God reflected therein is superficial, lacking in mystery, and exposed to the eyes of all. In the words of Augustine, “a God who is comprehensible is not God at all” (<italic>Sermons</italic>, CXVII, iii.v). To contrast that, the God of the philosophers and of the mystics is distant, concealed, and mysterious (<italic>Deus Absconditus)</italic> and embodies all that is profound and substantive in the religious consciousness. Unlike the Augustinian approach, Cherbonnier asserts that the biblical method of preserving God’s mystery is more successful than that of the mystics. Cherbonnier demonstrates that the biblical God is not superficial or transparent; on the contrary, precisely because of His humanity—and particularly His personality—He is complex and unexpected and therefore mysterious. Although the biblical God has other aspects as well (transhuman or nonhuman), Cherbonnier is correct in stating that His humanity does not nullify His mysterious dimensions but makes them more profound.

               <p>In the final analysis, the decisive majority of those theological approaches that reject the corporealization of God in the Jewish‐Christian world (and to a large extent also in the Muslim world) are one version or another of the Platonic and neo‐Platonic views that derived therefrom. At times, as in Maimonides, Aristotelian elements are incorporated into this picture, but this does not suffice to change the central source of inspiration of these theological outlooks, which are the dominant understandings of God in the (Judeo‐Christian) Western tradition.</p>

               <p>Another scholar whose studies of Bible and rabbinic literature tend toward a similar direction is Yehuda Liebes, to whom this work likewise owes a sincere debt. See, in particular, Liebes, “God’s Love and His Jealousy,” and “<italic>De Natura Dei</italic>: On the Jewish Myth and Its Transformation” [in Hebrew], in <italic>Masu’ot</italic>, ed. M. Oron and A. Goldreich (Tel Aviv, 1994), 243–97. Another book worth mentioning in this context is that of Harold Bloom, <italic>The Book of J</italic> (New York, 1991). Notwithstanding its numerous faults and its speculative elements (which create the definite impression that even the author does not relate to them seriously), this work contains new, provocative, and exciting insights. Bloom characterizes God in the J source as a Nietzschean personality, as Vitality lacking in inhibitions and limits. However, as Muffs shows and as we shall see below, the image of God in the Bible (including in J) is far more complex and includes a longing for connection with human beings and, as such, also for self‐control. In this context I should mention also the book of Carl Jung, <italic>Answer to Job</italic> (London, 1984). J. Miles’s <italic>God: A Biography</italic> (New York: Knopf, 1995) is particularly disappointing in this respect. For matters discussed in this article, cf. 39–46. As a rule, Miles describes the God portrayed in the Priestly sources as calculating and rational.</p>

               <p>The only exegetes who tended toward the reading of the Flood story in Genesis to be suggested here, or at least certain aspects thereof, were the Sages of the Midrash and the Aggadah. This is not surprising, for no less than the Sages attributed an image to God, they examined His personality, which they portrayed in a complex and even intricate manner. The interpretation of the story of the Flood and, particularly, of the subject of the rainbow offered below, is implied in a number of brief homilies—odd or strange at face value—that appear in <italic>Genesis Rabbah</italic> 35.14 and 35.12 (Theodor‐Albeck, 330 and 328), as well as in other Talmudic sources.

         <title>II</title>
         <p>The (overall) outlines of the plot are well known: it begins with the story of Creation, at whose center is the creation of human beings; it continues with humanity’s corruption and the Flood, from which Noah and his family and the living creatures that he brought with him on the ark were saved; and it concludes with the promise‐oath‐covenant made by God that “never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth” (Gen. 9:11). This narrative framework is common to both sources, J and P.37 What connects the various parts of the narrative, in both the Priestly and the Jahwist sources, are the genealogies (from Adam to Noah) interposed between the Creation narrative and the Flood story,38 and between the latter and the beginning of the patriarch's saga (from Noah to Abraham). By means of the genealogies, mythical time is gradually transformed into historical time.39 The dramatic differences between P and J are to be found in the “beginning,” in the Creation story,40 and it is those that to a large extent dictate the differences in details further on in the plot of the mythic time—that is, in the description of the corruption and the Flood and in the nature of the new world order that follows in its wake.</p>
         <p>The point of departure for the reading suggested below is the promise given by God (in J) and the covenant he made with Noah (in P) that He will never again “destroy every living creature” (J) and that “never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth” (P). This unconditional commitment of God, immediately following the Flood and common to J and P, is not based on any change that came about in humankind nor in any commitment on its part. To the contrary, both sources emphasize—the one explicitly and the other by implication—that the promise not to bring another flood upon the earth was given to human beings despite (or perhaps even because of) his corrupt and violent character, and despite the fact that there was no expectation that any change would take place within him. The Jahwist text relates that, immediately after the Flood, it became clear to God that “the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth” (Gen. 8:21), whereas in P, God established a new order based on His recognition of the violent nature of human beings. The reason why God decided to bring the Flood upon human beings is, in a certain sense, the same reason as that underlying His promise‐covenant that He will never again bring a flood to destroy the land.</p>
         <p>God’s awareness that man is “evil from his youth,” and His commitment to a unilateral covenant, raise a number of questions and puzzles relating to the Creation and Flood narrative generally: namely, if no change has taken place within human beings, why does God commit Himself to never again bring a flood upon the earth? Moreover, one might well ask, why did God bring the Flood in the first place? Didn’t He know the wicked and violent nature of human beings? And if not, how was it made known to Him during or after the Flood?</p>
         <p>These questions relate to the nature of God’s knowledge of human beings (and the relations between them). However, the surprising turn at the end of the Flood narrative also raises questions relating to God Himself: if “the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth” and violence is innate to him, then it is clear that human beings will return to their corrupt ways and once again arouse God’s wrath. This being so, how can God keep His promise and not violate His covenant? What is to prevent Him from again bursting out and destroying the land in a flood? Are the oath or the covenant strong enough to prevent Him?</p>
         <p>These questions are all interrelated. It would appear that the answers are not to be found in the theological‐rational realm nor in that of ethical discourse. Rather, they must be sought in the psychological realm, through analysis of the emotional aspects of God and of His actions. One who thinks that the biblical God is a version of the God of the philosopher—lacking in image and particularly without personality and therefore above all emotions—will dismiss out of hand the very formulation of such questions because of the Divine Honor. And indeed, because of this tendency (upon which I elaborated above), these obvious questions were not raised either by the majority of classical exegetes or by most modern scholars. However, for one who is freed of the bonds of theological rationalism, these questions may serve as a fruitful point of departure for an examination of the personality of the biblical God and its intricacies. In the final analysis, it is difficult to ignore the fact that the figure in whom the most significant transformations take place in the Creation and Flood narratives of P is God. In contrast to Him, no significant change takes place on the part of human beings. Similarly, the corruption in P is described as an integral part of human beings' nature.41</p>
         <p>In order to answer these questions and puzzlements, we must return to the beginning of the story, to the Creation narrative, and follow the development of matters from there. As I commented earlier, the end of the narrative is to a large extent dictated by the elements laid down at its very beginning. However, such a discussion‐analysis is one that I hope to present in another, more extensive work. In what follows here, I shall confine myself to the latter question, which is perhaps the most troubling of all: when human corruption repeats itself—as will inevitably occur, due to the defective nature of human beings—what is to prevent God’s wrath from once more breaking out and destroying everything? As I shall demonstrate below, this question lies in the background of the incident of the rainbow (the sign of the covenant), which is the final stage in the Priestly version of the Flood story.42 But before turning to it, I shall discuss the parallel final stage in J’s version of the Flood story.</p>

         <p>According to the Jahwist document, after the Flood, once “the face of the ground was dry” (Gen. 8:13a), Noah leaves the ark, builds an altar to the Lord, and offers thereon burnt offerings “of every clean animal and of every clean bird” (8:20). J does not explain the motivation for this offering. There are those who explain that Noah feared that God’s fury had not completely died down and he wished to appease Him, while others explain the purpose of the sacrifices as atonement, so as to completely remove the curse of the Flood. It seems more likely to me that this was simply a gesture of gratitude for being saved.43 The J document continues: “And when the Lord smelled the pleasing odor, the Lord said in His heart, `I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease'” (Gen. 8:21–22). These verses, as mentioned, conclude the Flood narrative in J, serving as its climax and its culmination. Their language is poetic and elevated and includes a kind of metaphysical declaration about the nature of man and the way of the world. These verses close a circle. They return precisely to the motifs, structure, and language of the verses with which the J Flood narrative opens (Gen. 6:5–7). The frankly physical and mental anthropomorphism with respect to God (“when the Lord smelled”; “the Lord said in His heart”) are characteristic of J. The phrase <italic>reah�� ha‐niḥoaḥ</italic> (the pleasing odor) indicates here, as it does in many other places in the Bible, that the offering and those offering it are pleasing to God.44 The Hebrew <italic>reaḥ ha‐niḥoaḥ</italic> is a deliberate alliteration on the name Noah and is parallel to the emphasis at the beginning of the narrative, “But Noah found favor [<italic>maẓa ḥen</italic>] in the eyes of the Lord” (Gen. 6:8).45 The phrase “and the Lord said in His heart [<italic>el libo</italic>],” preceding the promise to “never again curse the ground,” anticipates the phrase found further on in this verse, “for the imagination of man’s heart [<italic>yeẓer lev ha‐adam</italic>] is evil from his youth.” This parallel between God and human beings echoes a similar parallel in the opening verses of the narrative of the corruption and the Flood, as it appears in the J document: “The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [<italic>ve‐khol yeẓer maḥshevot libo</italic>] was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him to His heart [<italic>va‐yit’aẓev el libo</italic>]” (Gen. 6:5–6)—as if to say: the story begins with God’s sadness or brokenheartedness over the evil “imagination of the thoughts of the heart” of human beings and ends with a certain resignation on His part to the fact that “the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth.” This acceptance leads in turn to commitment,46 which in turn contributes to propitiation and calming.</p>
         <p>This is not merely a promise. As already noted by the early Rabbinic sages, the parallel phrase “I will never again curse … neither will I ever again destroy” is an oath.47 Indeed, this wording is interpreted thus in the verse from Isaiah (54:9) mentioned earlier: “For this is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth.” Further support for this interpretation may perhaps be found in the use of the word <italic>‘od</italic> (never, or neither),48 repeated in God’s words here three times (“I will never again [<italic>`od</italic>] curse the ground … neither [<italic>`od</italic>] will I ever again destroy … while [<italic>`od</italic>] the earth remains” [<italic>‘od kol yemei ha‐areẓ</italic>]).49 The dual commitment to refrain from bringing about a further catastrophe is parallel to the double mention of punishment in the verses with which the narrative opens (6:7: “I will blot out man whom I have created … man and beast”), thereby emphasizing His turning back from this threat. The term “curse” (<italic>qelalah</italic>), which had not been mentioned previously in the Flood story, indicates not only corruption and destruction (as in the parallel expression in our verse) but also insult and humiliation.50 It augments the dimensions of the injury caused by the Flood, in order to emphasize the commitment to refrain from such things in the future. Whether or not this is to be understood as an oath, it is clear that God is binding Himself by means of a promise that He cannot easily retract.</p>
         <p>Although the structure and form of the verses indicate “judgment [<italic>din</italic>] that is replaced by mercy [<italic>raḥamim</italic>],”51 their contents indicate that this reconciliation is a reluctant one, somewhat evasive. We do not find here any declaration of hope for a “new horizon.” On the contrary, God’s words (to Himself) imply disappointment and resignation: “For the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth [<italic>ra‘ min’urav</italic>]”; “From his youth”: that is, from the beginning, from his very creation. As I noted earlier, this is the great lesson that God derives from the event of the Flood and thus (indirectly) is also conveyed to the reader.</p>
         <p>I will qualify somewhat the above statement. That which prior to the Flood was a kind of empirical‐contingent experience or observation (“The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth” [Gen. 6:6]) thereafter turns into the recognition of a quasi‐metaphysical statement or principle (“for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth” [Gen. 8:21]). This slight change allows for the turnabout: the evil that results from the experience is the reason for the Flood, while evil as principle serves as the reason to refrain from it. But evidently, as we shall see further on, this turnabout is not complete.</p>
         <p>God does not gaze directly at Noah (“the righteous man, blameless in his generation”); He merely speaks “in His heart.”52 According to J, Noah and his sons, and their offspring thereafter, do not know of God’s commitment‐oath not to destroy or to curse the earth anymore. Possibly, due to His deep disappointment, God is unable to look directly at human beings, whom He now sees as utterly corrupt by nature; it could be that God only speaks to Himself because He is interested in maintaining the fear of a future flood among human beings. One way or another, after the Flood, human beings remain in the dark as to God’s future intentions. The Flood continues to threaten them. From their viewpoint, if they return to their corrupt and evil ways, God will once again strike them with full vengeance. This aspect of the Flood story in J not only indicates the fear to which man is subject from this point on but also says something about God’s personality and His manner of conducting Himself with His creatures. Even if, in the final analysis, the omniscient narrator of J (God, speaking to Himself in the third person?) makes known to the reader what is taking place here within God’s own thoughts (i.e., His commitment‐oath), that does not change the fact that He chose not to reveal His dramatic decision to the human beings. Moreover, it would seem that the fact that God is speaking “to His heart” detracts from the very force of His commitment. By its not being addressed to anyone, the promise is informal and thus incomplete; it is doubtful whether one may relate to this self‐commitment as a binding promise.</p>
         <p>The reason for the unconditional promise, in the Jahwist document, never again to bring a Flood is not based on a pacified acceptance of humanity’s weaknesses and faults. The reason is, rather, rooted in His wish to refrain from harming the innocent: “I will never again curse the ground because of man … neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.” The reason for the commitment in these verses is more complex than it seems at first glance. At its focus is, as we have said, the recognition that “the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth”—he cannot behave otherwise; even a Flood will not change him.53 The only benefit of the Flood is thus superfluous and unjustified harm to the earth and to the other living creatures. These verses seem to imply the following train of thought: God says to Himself that, if the Flood would have corrected the ways of mankind, that would be acceptable; that would have been a justification for the unavoidable harm caused to the earth and to the world of living creatures. But since man is “evil from his youth,” no Flood can change his nature or his way of behaving. Hence there is no justification for an additional flood, which would only harm—or so it would seem on the face of it—innocent bystanders.54</p>
         <p>This rationale does not even encompass an explicit commitment not to destroy human beings in the event of some future corruption, but merely a promise not to bring about a colossal catastrophe that will harm the cosmos as a whole and upset its regular cyclicity. It may be that the idiom “every living creature” also implies that human beings themselves will not again be harmed by a severe blow of this type, but there is no explicit statement to that effect.</p>
         <p>It is difficult to accept the literal sense of this explanation; it seems to be more rhetoric than substance. Making matters dependent on living creatures and the land is surprising, for according to the J document the animals were created by error—that is, their creation was an unsuccessful attempt to find a “helpmate” (<italic>‘ezer</italic>) for man (Gen. 2:18–24). The narrative of the creation of the various living creatures seems to imply that their ongoing existence is redundant. Moreover, there is some irony in the fact that God’s concern for the living creatures is emphasized immediately after He takes pleasure in the fragrance of their burning flesh. According to the story of the Creation in J, and throughout the length of this document, human beings are at the center, and they alone are the object of God’s concern. Does the J document suddenly attribute to the soil and to the other living creatures a status, such that because of them the world will be “saved”?</p>
         <p>There is a certain imbalance between the ambience of reconciliation (“the pleasing odor”) and the force of the commitment‐oath (never again to bring a Flood), on the one hand, and the thinness of the reason God gives for it, on the other hand. The reader wonders whether this justification will hold up in times of trial—whether it has the power to withstand the “wrath” over the corruption that is bound to come.</p>
         <p>It seems that more than justification, what we have here is rationalization (which, like all rationalizations, involves a certain element of self‐deception). The Divine emotion finds itself caught here between two poles. On the one hand, God does not succeed in overcoming (and perhaps does not wish to) His profound disappointment at humanity’s corruption and the evil that is structurally innate within it (<italic>mine‘urav</italic>). On the other hand, He is overwhelmed by the intensity of His own anger and the destruction He has sown. God feels that His response was misguided and that His violence was exaggerated, and, in the guise of a moral principle, He decides to embark on a new path. More than a justification or rationale, this is a self‐righteous justification for binding and fastening Himself.</p>
         <p>God forgives here only in part. As Muffs has shown in other biblical contexts, God is not willing (and perhaps unable) to come forward to meet sinful human beings “all the way.” Thus, for example, following the sin of the Golden Calf, God plans in His great anger to destroy the people and to begin everything anew with Moses (Exod. 32:7–10). After numerous efforts, Moses succeeds in restraining the Divine fury,55 but this restraint is only partial; the most that God is willing to do is to put off the punishment, and even that at the price of separating Himself from the people: “Behold My angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit [<italic>b‐yom pokdi</italic>], I will visit their sin upon them [<italic>u‐fakadti ’alehem hata’tam</italic>]” (Exod. 32:34). Further on He says, “and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy” (Exod. 33:19). The most explicit expression of this approach appears in the passage known as the Thirteen Qualities (<italic>middot</italic>) of Mercy: “The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.” Nevertheless, “but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generations” (Exod. 34:6–7).</p>
         <p>In this context, Muffs proposes what he refers to as “the doctrine of ‘in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them’” (Exod. 32:34). According to this doctrine, the jealous and furious God decides at this point to forgo punishing the sinner (“forgiveness” is not an appropriate term for this emotional state of affairs) but exacts punishment from his descendants (see Exod. 34:6–7).56 According to Muffs, this is the “attribute of mercy within judgment,” whose “power lies in the holding back of anger and fury.” He sees in this approach the “second stage in the Israelite concept of ethics,” an intermediate stage between the first stage, according to which sin has an objective character—that is, it is a kind of bodily illness, and punishment comes about through natural causality (i.e., there is no way to nullify or postpone it)—and the third stage, in which sin is of a subjective character, a kind of mental disease, healed by the repentance of the sinner.57 However, it would appear that the terms “doctrine” or “approach” are not really appropriate to this second, intermediate stage. According to the terms used by Muffs himself, what we encounter here on God’s part is just an emotional, unreflective balance between His jealousy and His desire for vengeance and God’s incomplete acceptance of the plea of the prophet, who succeeds only in bringing God to a partial awareness of His explosive violence, which harms His own needs and interests. This emotional balance is neither an ethical approach nor a theological doctrine, and it is rather doubtful whether it is even proper to refer to it as an ethical quality. The inner core of this emotional structure of God, repeated in the Bible (in various forms), is a jealousy “that grows progressively stronger” and which God succeeds to repress and restrain only after a great deal of work and with only limited success.58</p>
         <p>Let us now return to the verses of propitiation following the Flood. The numerous exegetes who understood these verses (Gen. 8:21–22) as signifying God’s reconciliation with human beings were not entirely wrong. In the literal sense, God’s words do not express full acceptance; however, in the final analysis they are addressed to human beings and imply, albeit indirectly and in convoluted language, a desire for a “new beginning.” What the exegetes missed here is the partial nature of reconciliation, the sense of failure, that embodies the unwillingness (and inability) of God to look human beings straight in the eyes, so to speak, and bear them with all their faults and weaknesses. While still addressing human beings, God redirects the reasons for His promise to the earth and the living creatures. The difference between full reconciliation and incomplete appeasement is a profound one. Full reconciliation provides certainty with regard to the future, while grudging appeasement contains within it the seeds of the next outburst (in whose wake the unavoidable future destruction is bound to come).</p>
         <p>Against the background of this ending of the Flood narrative in J, I shall now turn to the parallel chapter, that is, the concluding chapter of the Flood narrative in the Priestly source.</p>

               <p>Commentators have noted that the motif of cursing of the earth here (Gen. 8:5) returns us to the cursing of the earth in 3:17. This claim is correct. However, as we have seen above, the central reference of Gen. 8:21, both in terms of contents and in the formal‐linguistic sense, is first and foremost 6:5 and the punishment of the Flood that was decreed there. The curse here is the curse of the Flood, not the curse of the land due to the sin in the Garden of Eden. Nevertheless, it is possible that God implies here a certain regret for the earlier punishment (cf. Westermann, <italic>Genesis</italic>, 455–56).</p>

         <title>IV</title>
         <p>The last chapter in the Flood narrative of P, the “stage of reconciliation” (Gen. 9:1–17), is far broader and more complex than its counterpart in the Jahwist document. It includes blessings for fruitfulness and a renewed charging of Noah and his offspring with dominion over the Creation and other living beings (Gen. 9:1–2, 7); a new moral order, including permission to eat the flesh of living creatures, along with a prohibition against eating their blood and a prohibition of all bloodshed (including that of human beings by animals), coupled with a compulsory death penalty for those who spill blood (verses 3–6); the establishment of a covenant so that “never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth” (verses 8–11); and the introduction of the sign of the covenant—the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds (verses 12–17).</p>
         <p>That which is explicit in J is only implied in P. P does not declare that man is “evil from his youth,” but consciousness of his innate faults is clearly implied in the contents of the “new constitution” that God establishes upon their leaving the ark. The very essence of this constitution is a compromise with human beings' inborn tendency toward violence. This codex is explicitly presented as a departure from the ideal vision of vegetarianism and peace given on the sixth day of Creation: “every beast of the earth, every bird of the air, everything that creeps on the ground … into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything” (9:2–3). It is important to emphasize that we are not speaking here of a revision of an earlier law, as in these verses certain normative rules appear for the first time in P, including permission (to eat flesh), alongside a series of prohibitions and duties. In the ideal world before the Flood, there is no mention of the existence of rules. It was evidently based on natural ethics, an abstract ethical principle that human beings, through their own understanding, will know how to implement in every specific case, without any need for formal, restrictive rules. After the Flood, rules seem to have been created for the first time—again, due to the awareness that human beings, like God, require mechanisms of restraint.</p>
         <p>Unlike God’s way in the J document, in which He only speaks “to His heart,” in the Priestly document God turns directly to address Noah and his sons (more than once, as we shall see below). It may be for this reason that He somewhat conceals His awareness that human beings are fundamentally violent and does not state so explicitly. In the final analysis, God, according to P, wants to open a new page and is interested in conveying a message of reconciliation and hope.</p>
         <p>God’s commitment is embodied, as said, in the covenant that He established with Noah and his sons (Gen. 9:8–11): “Then God said to Noah and his sons with him, `Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.'” In the Priestly document, as in that of the Jahwist, God commits Himself never to bring a flood upon the earth again. If, in J, God limits Himself by means of an oath, here God places restraints upon Himself by means of a covenant, whose force is no less obligatory (and evidently even more so).59 The covenant is unilateral; the obligation is of God alone; there is no obligation, at least not explicitly stated, undertaken by human beings.60 The covenant cannot be other than one‐sided, as God’s commitment is toward “every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle,” and so on, as well as toward the land itself.61</p>
         <p>The unilateral nature of the covenant is accentuated by the fact that it appears in a new act of speech of God addressed toward Noah and his sons, separate from his earlier words, at whose conclusion there appears a group of laws (prohibition against eating blood, prohibition against bloodshed, and so on)—as if to say: there is no connection between the two things; that is, obedience to the commandments in God’s earlier words is not a condition of His fulfillment of the commitment given in the second statement.62 It is needless to add that the one‐sided covenant implies God’s awareness of the fundamental shortcomings and flaws of human beings (i.e., that he is “evil from his youth”).</p>
         <p>Yet at the same time, P draws a connection between the two acts of speech, particularly between the final verse of the first speech, “And you, be fruitful and multiply, bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply in it” (verse 7), and the language used at the beginning of the next speech, “And I am establishing my covenant with you [<italic>va‐ani hineni mekim et beriti itkhem</italic>]”—as if to say: you are encouraged to be fruitful and multiply, and should you be astonished and hesitant, thinking “the flood frightens us,” God declares: I promise (through a one‐sided covenant) that “never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”63 The double language of this passage, “Behold, I establish my covenant with you” (verse 9) and “I establish my covenant with you” (verse 11)—“that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth” (verse 11)—is a kind of ceremonial repetition intended to reinforce the covenant. Verses 9–10 declare the establishment of the covenant, while the repetition in verse 11 emphasizes its contents.64</p>
         <p>Alongside the unilateral covenant that God establishes that “never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth,” God adds the sign of the covenant, namely, the rainbow:<disp-quote>
               <p>And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations; I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. When the bow is in the clouds, I will look upon it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.” God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.” (Gen. 9:12–17)</p>
            </disp-quote>

         <p>Like the preceding paragraph concerning the subject of the covenant, this paragraph, dealing with the sign of the covenant, also includes duplications; indeed, even more so (verses 12 and 17: “this is the sign of the covenant”; verses 13–16, 15–16, 17).65 But here too, apart from the solemn, ceremonial repetitions, the differences between the double languages are significant in terms of both content and theology, as we shall see below.66</p>
         <p>As a “sign of the covenant” for “all future generations” between Himself and “every living creature that is with you,” God places the rainbow in the clouds. We are not speaking of granting new significance to an object that had already been created during the Six Days of Creation. The placing of the bow in the clouds is evidently a new creation of God following the Flood (<italic>zot ot ha‐brit asher ani noten</italic>, followed by: <italic>et kashti natati be’anan</italic>).67 In this respect, the creation of the rainbow is the physical counterpart to the introduction of new norms (i.e., permission to eat flesh, prohibition against eating blood, etc.) that appears in the previous verses.68</p>
         <p>For what reason did God create the rainbow immediately after the Flood? What function did He intend for it? The radiant rainbow, seen against the background of a dark and threatening cloud, is a thick and pregnant symbol. Even if we remove several of the symbolic meanings that have been ascribed to it over the course of generations, it is clear that, according to the original meaning of the Flood story in P, the rainbow has a ceremonial purpose, as a festive and striking sight, symbolizing world peace and reconciliation between the upper and lower realms. However, a closer reading of the biblical text reveals that, apart from these significances, the Creator intends a practical, operative function for the rainbow. Even before its establishment as a symbol filled with significance, the rainbow is intended to serve God as a kind of instrument for controlling His own wrath. To use another, albeit anachronistic, term: the rainbow is a mechanism for anger management, which God created as a device for controlling His anger. Moreover, its symbolic meaning, which is evidently loaded with seemingly contradictory messages, is derived from its intended purpose on God’s part to serve as a means of self‐restraint.</p>
         <p>Let us return to the verses themselves. Immediately after God informs Noah and his sons of the establishment of the covenant (9:9), He goes on to declare, “This is the sign of the Covenant which I make between me and you … for all future generations.” “This” (<italic>zot</italic>) is evidently an indicatory language, the sign being “I set my bow in the cloud [and it shall be a sign of the Covenant]” (verse 13). God, as we said, creates a rainbow and places it in the cloud.69 Two details in verse 11 catch the eye. First, it does not say “I have placed the bow,” but rather “my bow” (<italic>et kashti</italic>), that is, one that belongs or pertains to Me. The possessive suffix may be an allusion to the Divine bow with which He shot arrows and lightning during the tempest of the Flood, which He now hangs upside down in the cloud (the actual bow facing Him) as a sign of peace.70 However, as we shall see immediately, the emphasis upon it being “my bow” refers first and foremost to the effect of the bow upon God from that point on.71 Second, the bow is not placed in the Heavens; in this chapter, it is always “in the cloud” (<italic>be’anan</italic>); God Himself repeatedly emphasizes that He places His bow in the cloud, a combination of words that is repeated three times: (“I set My bow in the cloud” [13]; “when the bow is seen in the clouds” [14]; “When the bow is in the clouds” [16]).72</p>
         <p>These two items—“my bow” and “the bow in the cloud”—are immediately clarified in the following verses: “When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud, I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh” (Gen. 9:14–15). The phrase “when I bring clouds over the earth” (<italic>ve‐hayah b‘aneni ‘anan ’al ha’areẓ</italic>) does not refer to “rains of blessing” that come down in the ordinary manner, but, to quote Rashi’s words, “when the thought occurs to me [i.e., the Creator] to bring darkness and destruction into the world.”73 In other words, the rainbow will appear when a new flood threatens to destroy the world. This wording implies the following scenario: when human beings will again behave improperly and corruptly, God’s jealousy will grow more intense and will prepare to break out in another flood that will inundate the land. At that time, “the bow is seen in the clouds.” The appearance of the “bow in the clouds,” says God, will remind me of “my covenant which is between me and you.” The remembering of the covenant will restrain me, and I will stop the destructive flood in a timely manner. The phrase in the following verse, “the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh” (15), indicates clearly that in verse 14, God is concerned with cataclysmic flood clouds. The rainbow is thus a kind of barrier between God and His zeal (“My anger”) and is meant as a guarantee that “the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.”</p>
         <p>The passive language “the bow is seen in the clouds” (<italic>ve‐nirata ha‐keshet be‘anan</italic>) emphasizes the fact that it appears by itself, not as the result of action initiated by “the merciful God.”74 The text draws a contrast between the activity that God attributes to Himself (“when I bring clouds over the earth”) and His passivity vis‐à‐vis the appearance of the bow (“is seen”). A similar contrast exists between God’s placing of the bow now (at the time of establishment of the Covenant) and its independent appearance in the future. The appearance of the bow is thus a kind of natural‐physical effect‐result of the strengthening of the flood clouds. Its entire aim is to signal to God so that He may stop Himself. These two motifs—the independence of the bow, and the description of God as being passive in relation to its appearance, while active after it is seen—are duplicated and emphasized in the following verse: “When the bow is in the clouds” (<italic>ve‐hayta ha‐keshet be‘anan</italic>)—again, by itself. If, in verse 14, the bow appears by itself, here it is as if it even comes into existence by itself: “I will look upon it and remember (<italic>ure’itiha lizkor</italic>) the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature and all flesh that is upon the earth” (verse 16). If, in verse 15, the bow appears (to all) and God remembers, here the act of seeing is attributed specifically to God and is focused only upon Him, so that He may “remember the everlasting covenant.”75 The text thus repeatedly emphasizes that the creation of the bow in the clouds, as a natural consequence, causes God to see in order “to remember” and thereby halt His planned action.</p>
         <p>The repeated emphasis on “the bow in the cloud” (“I set My bow in the cloud”; “the bow is seen in the clouds”; “the bow is in the clouds”)—and not simply “bow”—serves two purposes. First, to emphasize that the appearance of the bow is a (natural, causal) response to an approaching flood (cloud); second, if the “cloud” embodies/symbolizes God’s wrath, then the “bow in the cloud” symbolizes, even embodies, the restraining factor “within Himself.”</p>
         <p>That God intends the bow first and foremost for Himself follows clearly from the repeated use in these verses of the declension of verbs in the first person: “I will remember” (<italic>ve‐zakharti</italic>), “I will look upon it” (<italic>ure’itiha</italic>), and so on. To these one must add various nouns declined in the conjunctive first person: “I establish my covenant”; “I establish my covenant with you” (<italic>briti</italic> and not <italic>brit</italic>); “my bow” (<italic>kashti</italic>)76—as if to say, “my covenant,” that is, for me (and also “with myself”)—“my bow,” that is, for My sake. These verses do not make any explicit statement that human beings will see the bow in the future; its being seen by human beings is only referred to in an elusive and indirect way, by means of the passive declension of the verb, “will be seen,” “to remember” (<italic>ve‐nirata</italic>; <italic>lizkor</italic>)—and not “you shall see,” “you shall remember,” and the like. It would appear that this stylistic/linguistic formation of the verses was not intended to hide the appearance of the bow from the people living on the earth, but rather to emphasize, first of all, that God intends it for Himself “to remember the everlasting covenant.”77</p>
         <p>Let us dwell for a moment on the motif of remembrance (<italic>zekhirah</italic>), emphasized here (“I will remember My Covenant,” “to remember the everlasting covenant,” and so forth). As has already been suggested above, if God places a bow in the clouds in order to remind Himself of his covenant, He evidently fears (or even knows) that He will forget it. This “forgetting” is anchored, as we have said, in the tempest of jealousy concerning the sins of human beings, which cause Him to ignore “the covenant and the loving kindness.”78 This concern is not artificial, but is rooted, among other things, in the “forgetting” that evidently took place at the height of the present Flood (to which the motif of remembering in the bow passage is connected). Following the description of the strengthening of the Flood (over the course of 150 days!) and its destructive results (Gen. 7:21: “and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, bird, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man”), P goes on to say, “But God remembered Noah [<italic>va‐yizkor elohim et noaḥ</italic>] and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided; the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained” (Gen. 8:1–2). This remembrance raises a certain puzzle. One might have thought that during the course of the Flood, Noah would be constantly present in God’s thoughts. In the final analysis, his saving was an integral part of the plan of the Flood, and it was for its sake that God carried out the covenant made with him (Gen. 6:18). How then could it be that, throughout the course of the Flood, God seems to have forgotten Noah so that He needed to remember him?79 It seems to me that, here too, this was a result of the dynamic of Divine emotion. The more the waters rose, the greater grew God’s anger; the image of the ever‐rising flood waters seems like a kind of mirror of what is taking place within God.80 His anger fills Him and takes control over Him to the point that even Noah, His beloved‐elected one, and the covenant that He made with him—in essence, His entire plan to enable the continuation of human life upon the earth—are “forgotten” from the horizon of His consciousness.81 In order to “save” Noah—or, better, in order to return to His original plan—remembrance was required.82 It would seem that, after the Flood, God also learns from this fresh experience. He Himself prepares the “bow in the clouds” so that in the future, when His anger again comes, it will remind Him of “the everlasting covenant,” “and the waters shall never again become a flood.”</p>
         <p>In order to refine the distinction between the reading proposed here and the usual, common reading of the chapter of the covenant and the rainbow (and by extension of the chapter of the Flood as a whole), I will cite a brief passage from the commentary of Umberto Cassuto, whose method of interpreting this chapter is typical of both Jewish and Christian scholars and exegetes through the ages. Cassuto writes:<disp-quote>
               <p>As God will always see the bow in the cloud, He will always remember His promise, and it will not occur to Him to bring a flood upon the earth. And more than it will be for Him, it will serve as a sign for the future.</p>
               <p>The entire purpose of this third phrase is to provide assurance to Noah and his sons regarding the future: if the P says here that God made this sign known to them, this means that the statement is important specifically to them. They will always see the bow in the cloud, and this constant seeing will serve them as a sign and symbol of the promise of God, who remembers the covenant.83</p>
            </disp-quote>My own reading of the chapter of the Flood and the rainbow differs from that of Cassuto in almost every point and detail. First of all, unlike his statement, God does not “always” see the bow. The bow is only seen “in the cloud”—that is, in flood clouds that God brings because of His anger and jealousy toward sinful human beings.</p>
         <p>Second, God will not “constantly remember His promise.” To the contrary, as human corruption grows greater, His fury grows stronger, and He loses sight of the covenant. It is therefore not correct to say that “it will not occur to Him to bring another flood upon the world”; on the contrary, his zeal motivates Him “to bring upon the world darkness and destruction” (as Rashi says).</p>
         <p>Third, it is incorrect to say that “more than it will be for Him, it will serve as a sign for the future … to assure Noah and his sons of security in the future.” On the contrary, the rainbow was intended first of all to remind God of His covenant and thereby to halt His jealousy and fury that were liable to break out. Only in an indirect tangential and secondary manner does the rainbow make human beings aware of God’s kindnesses, that He has overcome Himself and did not destroy them in His jealousy. Cassuto, like many other commentators, felt that, according to the biblical language, God intended the rainbow first of all for Himself (“my bow”; “I will remember”; “I will look upon it”). However, because of his own (characteristic) theological tendency, he turned it into a sign and signifier (from God) to human beings.84</p>
         <p>Finally, although the rainbow is also a sign for human beings, it is not only a comforting sign. To the contrary, more than it signifies abundant Divine grace, the appearance of the rainbow arouses concern and fear, as if to say that there is a thin line separating the world from catastrophic destruction. Were it not for the mechanism of the rainbow, which is external to God, His wrath would reduce the world to chaos. The rainbow is thus a sign, not of God’s increased loving‐kindness in the present, but rather of His grace in the distant past, which awakens His hidden grace in the present and prevents Him from acting upon His anger in the here and now.</p>
         <p>Hence, the appearance of the rainbow teaches us the complexity and duality of Divine‐human relations. The covenant from the past (mediated by the sign of the covenant) restrains the Divine anger and attempts to arouse God’s compassion in the present. To use the terms of the sages and the medieval Kabbalists, it is a complex mixture of the attribute of judgment (<italic>middat ha‐din</italic>) with the attribute of mercy (<italic>middat ha‐raḥamim</italic>). This duality is also characteristic of the rainbow in the symbolic realm: it is colorful and brilliant, but its background is dark and gloomy; it radiates innocence and optimism, but it is reminiscent of a weapon of violence and destruction.</p>
         <p>God therefore fixed the bow as a mechanism for self‐control. The passage of the rainbow, like the unilateral covenant from which it is derived, implies the recognition (developed throughout the course of the Flood narrative) of human being’s faulty nature. In acknowledging the inevitability of his corruption, God knows that His jealousy will strengthen, causing Him to forget His promise, and that at the time of anger He will be unable to restrain Himself. Now, while setting up the covenant, when the anger of the Flood was forgotten and He is balanced and calm—and, most of all, close to Himself, that is, to his real needs and interests—God creates a mechanism that will halt Himself and stop His anger. This is the primary purpose of the bow that appears “in the cloud” whenever human beings sin and a flood threatens to come. Its impressive appearance reminds God of His covenant; He will restrain Himself, and in so doing, also the flood clouds.</p>
         <p>It is important to emphasize that, even before the creation of the “natural” mechanism of the rainbow, we find a restraining and balancing element on the part of the jealous God. Were it not for this element, humankind’s corruption would cause Him to break out without thinking at all about the reality following the Flood. Had that been the case, God would not have called upon Noah to build the Ark (which He planned for him in detail; see Gen. 6:13–16) and to bring to it representatives of every living species so that they might be saved and begin a new page. He would have simply reduced the world to chaos and (if at all) start everything from the beginning. God felt His own growing fury and jealousness and knows that, once it dominates Him, nothing can stand in its path. This reflex enables Him to prepare Himself for the outburst while there is yet time and to plan the world to be built upon its ruins. This contrast between anger, which so to speak breaks out without discrimination, and the reflective element, which is aware of its awesome power and prepares for its coming and plans “the day after,” is characteristic of the personality of the zealot. God attempts to strengthen the rational‐reflective element by means of the rainbow. He may have feared that, following the next round of corruption, His zeal would become so strong that He would not succeed in planning “the world thereafter”; and it may be that now, after the Flood, He understands that the idea of “a new beginning”—or at the very least, of another “new start”—is pointless. He needs to learn to live with what there is. Thus, the rainbow does not create a restraining element within God from nothing; by means of the rainbow, God strengthens an element that is already existing within Him, embodied in His plan to save Noah before the outbreak of the Flood.</p>
         <p>An additional example of this personal‐psychological tension is embodied in God’s words to Moses on Mt. Sinai, immediately after he was informed about the sin of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32. This chapter (and those that follow, 33–34) do not belong to P but are probably part of J or E.85 I refer to them here—and to other biblical examples (from the Pentateuch and the Prophets)—only to show that the Bible is replete with terse descriptions of God’s complex emotions, which relate primarily to the modes in which his wrath and jealousy ignite and the devices to manage them.86 After God notifies Moses about the sin and instructs him to “Go down” (“for your people … have corrupted themselves … they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshipped and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’” [Exod. 32:7–8]), He addresses him in the following words: “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff‐necked people; now therefore let Me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; but of you I will make a great nation” (Exod. 32:9–10). The parallels between the chapter of the Golden Calf and that of the Flood are quite apparent. The plot of both embodies a dramatic contrast between God’s goodness (Creation; Giving of the Torah) and the evil and ungratefulness of human beings (in the Flood story, expressed in their corruption [<italic>hishḥit</italic>]; in the story of the Calf, through their faithlessness and idolatry, also referred to as corruption [<italic>hishḥit</italic>]). In both cases, God’s reaction is harsh and total. He wishes to destroy all (all human beings and “every living thing”; all the people of Israel) and to begin again from the beginning with a chosen personality (Noah; Moses).87</p>
         <p>What interests us here is the emotional complexity involved in God’s address to Moses. The jealousy of the betrayed God becomes progressively stronger; He knows that the outburst will come and that, once it is realized, nothing will stand in its way. However, He is still in control. When he addresses Moses with the words “Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them [<italic>ve’atah haniḥah li ve‐yiḥar api bahem va‐akhalem</italic>],” He is asking permission to release the constraints upon His fury so that He may destroy Israel. This language involves a kind of objectification of the Divine fury that is, so to speak, separate from God. But one must not be mistaken—this is merely a rhetorical device: the destructive jealousy is an essential part of His personality and His will (“let Me alone that My wrath may burn hot”). It seems that, more than asking permission, God is hinting to Moses that He wants him to act so as to help to restrain His anger that is becoming stronger and stronger—for if this were not the case, why does He need to ask permission? Moses has not even begun to pray! Why does God not allow His anger to grow and to break out? The hint “Stop Me!” is part of the emotional logic of asking permission in such situations. Moses is pressured and, “through a joint effort,”88 helps to halt the Divine fury and prevent the destruction that was likely to follow. God’s addressing Moses is an explicit example of anger that is still controlled by the reflective (“second order”) will and that seeks help “from outside.” The outburst occurs once the jealousy becomes powerful and there is no external restraining factor (in the case of the Flood, the bow; here, Moses).89</p>
         <p>Regarding the restraining function of the prophet Ezekiel, the prophet speaks as follows: “The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery; they have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without redress. And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. Therefore I have poured out My indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their ways have I requited upon their heads, says the Lord God” (Ezek. 22:29–31). God Himself declares that the function of the prophet is to “stand in the breach … that I should not destroy it.”90 And indeed, in these very same terms the Psalmist describes Moses’ activity, “Therefore He said He would destroy them—had not Moses, His chosen one, stood in the breach before Him, to turn away His wrath from destroying them” (Ps. 106:23). The Bible describes the activity of other prophets in a similar manner.91 The Divine wrath bursts out when God does not find a prophet who sets a boundary and helps Him to contain His anger. Unlike the prophet, the rainbow is a natural mechanism that God creates for Himself. Like the prophet, the rainbow also warns human beings; its appearance is a sign of God’s (restrained) fury, caused by their corruption;92 both the rainbow and the prophet are needed by Heaven to stand in the breach.</p>
         <p>Did a Flood again threaten to come, and was it stopped by the mechanism of the rainbow? There is no indication in the Bible of a flood that threatened to again destroy the world. However, it is known that, according to the biblical narrative following the Flood (according to P) and the incident of the Tower of Babel and the dispersal of the nations “over the face of all the earth” (according to J), God ceased to be interested in mankind as a whole; God’s love and passion and jealousy were now focused primarily on Abraham and his descendants. From this point on, the issue of Divine jealousy and the manner of its restraint must be examined, not within the framework of God’s relations with humanity but in terms of His relations with the people of Israel. And indeed, following the period of Genesis, God’s anger is not directed toward the corruption of human beings as a whole but toward the sins of Israel. The outlines of the Flood narrative and the Divine emotion invested therein appear repeatedly further on in the framework of God’s relationship with His people: Israel sins and becomes corrupt and wicked; God in His anger contemplates destroying them and wishes to start everything from the beginning. Thus, as we have seen above, in the sin of the Calf and in that of the Spies (Exod. 32:9; Num. 17:10), Moses is intended to replace Noah. As Muffs has shown, also in these chapters, God sets up means of restraining His anger. For our purposes, as opposed to the Flood narrative, in all these events, God overcomes His tendency toward outbursts of fury and is prevented from destroying Israel. One can credit this change to the personality of Moses (and the other prophets), who, unlike Noah, actively marshals his strength to restrain God (as mentioned, it is implied in Ezekiel’s words that this is one of the functions that God sets aside for His prophets when He appoints them). This may also allude to the special affection God holds for His people. However, it would appear that God is also a party to this change: in the background of His “overcoming” lies the experience of the Flood and the promise not to bring another comprehensive disaster. And indeed, the relationship between the oath that follows the Flood and the relative restraint exercised by God toward His people emerges from the Bible itself, in the words of Isaiah cited earlier: “For this is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you” (Isa. 54:9).</p>

               <p>Prior to the Flood, after God instructs Noah to build an ark and informs him, “Behold, I will bring a flood,” He adds, “But I will establish my covenant with you” (Gen. 6:18). Exegetes and scholars are in agreement that this does not refer to the covenant that He made with Noah and his sons after the Flood, but rather a covenant to save them from the approaching flood. See, for example, Ibn Ezra, Nahmanides, and Rashi; see also Westermann (<italic>Genesis</italic>, 422–23), who comments that this covenant is tantamount to promise. Compare Cassuto, (<italic>Commentary</italic>, 106–7), who thought that this was a covenant to ensure the continuity of humankind from Noah, in whom the blessing of fruitfulness given to Adam was fulfilled, but see Westermann’s well‐taken criticism of him on this point.</p>

The phrase “I have placed [<italic>natati</italic>]” may easily be understood as a continuous present tense, as in Gen. 23:13:נתתי כסף השדה  (I will give the price of the field; accept it from me). It is important to note that external difficulties in the text, from the areas of physics or rationalist theology, which troubled the medieval commentators, are not the concern of the mythic‐etiological biblical text.</p>

               <p>See Cassuto (<italic>Commentary</italic>, 141–42), who thinks that the expression “my bow” here is connected to the motif of the god who wages war with bow and arrow, which is a widespread image in Mesopotamian (and other) mythology and in the early Israelite epic, which the Torah abandoned and contracted, leaving here only a weak echo. On this motif in the Scriptures, see, for example, Hab. 3:9–11; Ps. 38:3; and in the Torah, Num. 24:8; Deut. 32:23, 42; and likewise many other biblical passages. See Nahmanides’ commentary, s.v. <italic>zot ot ha‐brit</italic>; cf. Gunkel, <italic>Genesis</italic>, 150. However, most of the Christian exegetes opposed this attribution; they think that the rainbow in its entirety represents Divine love and compassion and is not at all connected to violent or warlike images, certainly not to the image of God who wages war with a bow.

               <p>It is worth taking note of the poetics of this verse. The rootראה  (to see), whose declension is passive in relation to God in verse 14, “and the bow is seen,” is exchanged in verse 16 for an active form in relationship to Him, “And I shall see it,” while the active language ascribed to God in verse 15, “and I shall remember,” is exchanged in verse 16 for the neutral “to remember.”</p>

               <p>From this point of view, the comparison between the passage on the bow and that of <italic>ẓiẓit</italic> is instructive. Regarding <italic>ẓiẓit</italic>, God commands the Israelites, “Bid them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations … to look upon and remember all the commandments of the Lord, to do them, not to follow after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined to go after wantonly. So you shall remember and do all My commandments, and be holy to your Lord” (Num. 15:37–40). Like the rainbow, so too the <italic>ẓiẓit</italic> or tassels are a kind of mechanism for self‐control; seeing them reminds one of one’s obligations and serves as a barrier against following random inclinations. Here too the text emphasizes seeing and remembering. However, whereas the section on <italic>ẓiẓit</italic> refers to seeing and remembering on the part of Israel, that is, human beings, the chapter of the rainbow also speaks of seeing and remembering on the part of God.

               <p>Scholars and commentators have deliberated on the meaning of the occurrence of “remembrance” in the middle of the Flood and have suggested various interpretations. The common denominator of all of them is the effort to remove the element of forgetfulness from the phrase “and God remembered” (<italic>va‐yizkor elohim</italic>), and none of these commentaries seem to fit the simple meaning of Scripture. See Westermann, <italic>Genesis</italic>, 441. On remembrance in the Bible, see the entryזכר  (H. Eising) in <italic>TDOT</italic>, IV.64–82. Indeed, the semantic field of the term “remembrance” (זכרון) in the Bible is extensive. At times it means thinking about, attributing importance to, or an extending of graciousness (see, e.g., Gen. 19:29, 30:22; Jon. 4:11). In any event, in Genesis 9, in the matter of the rainbow (“and I shall remember my covenant”)—and in the course of doing so also in Gen. 8:1, “but God remembered Noah”—remembrance follows forgetting (see Fox, “The Sign of the Covenant,” 572).</p>

               <p>Compare the language of Ps. 78:38: “Yet He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; He restrained His anger often, and did not stir up all His wrath.” In this context, it is also worth mentioning that the story of the Golden Calf is interwoven with a variety of mechanisms for restraining God’s jealousy over the sins of the people, all of which are used by God Himself during the course of His complex negotiation with Moses. Thus, for example, after God withdraws from His intention to destroy the people as a whole, He suffices with destroying the sinners alone and postponing the punishment of the people for the future, saying to the people: “But now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you; Behold, My angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them” (Exod. 32:34). God’s distancing Himself from the people and the appointment of an angel in His place reappear further on (33:1–6) when God commands Moses: “Depart, go up hence, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I have swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” but then He emphasizes, “and I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites … but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you in the way, for you are a stiff‐necked people.” The people hear this and immediately, “they mourned” (verse 4), but God again emphasizes, “For the Lord had said to Moses, ‘Say to the people of Israel, “you are stiff‐necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you”’” (verse 5). God knows that people will again become corrupt and that He will be angry with them. He knows that a similar event will surely occur and is likely to be fatal; it is doubtful to Him whether He, or Moses, will then be able to halt His anger from destroying them at once. The solution offered (now that He is calm) is to distance Himself from the corruption and to send His angel in His place. In this context, I will note that in the Bible, generally speaking, the “angel of the Lord” is not an entity completely separate from God but is a kind of extension of Him. God’s angel is, it is true, separate from God; however (like the “image of God”; see below), it entails a certain Divine presence. See, e.g., Exod. 23:20–21: “Behold, I send an angel before you, to guard you on the way … give heed to him and hearken to his voice … for he will not pardon your transgression; for My Name is on him,” where God notes His presence “inside” the angel. And indeed, in the next verse there is a deliberate mixture of the angel with God: “but if you hearken attentively to his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries,” and similarly in many other verses. The exchange of God for the angel is a kind of a compromise; there is a separation from the people but also indirectly a kind of presence within them. Here too, God proposes a sort of instrument for self‐restraint: to keep His distance and to send an angel in His place, as if to say, “I am only able to love you from afar; closeness between us is dangerous to Me, and even more so to you.” If this is not a “divorce,” it is certainly a kind of “living separately” (and indeed, immediately thereafter, Moses moves the Tent of Meeting outside of the camp; verses 7–11). One ought not to make light of the dramatic nature of this proposal, for according to the biblical narrative, God’s greatest yearning is to dwell among the children of Israel; hence, His decision to remove Himself from them and to send an angel in His place is, from His viewpoint, a constitutive change and an expression of deep disappointment. And indeed, not surprisingly, in the end, Moses succeeds in persuading God not to realize His intention to send an angel in His place (at least according to Exod. 33:12–16; see esp. 14–15: “And He said, ‘My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.’ And he said to Him, ‘If Thy presence will not go with me, do not carry us up from here’”; but compare also Exod. 23:20–23). The means God gives Moses to restrain His anger is, as is well known, the Thirteen Qualities of Mercy (Exod. 34:6–7).</p>

               <p>There may be a difference on this point. Typically, the prophet comes to warn the people before the Divine wrath becomes strong, attempting to convince them to change their behavior so as to prevent the anger growing to the point where it becomes uncontrollable. By contrast, the appearance of the rainbow is a sign of Divine jealousy that has already strengthened and is intended to rein it in.</p>

         <p>In terms of the frame story, there is a resemblance between the final stage of the Flood narrative in P and its parallel in J. In both cases, immediately after Noah and his sons leave the Ark, God promises never again to bring a flood upon the world. In both versions, the promise is a result of the emotional depth‐processes alluded to in the verses. However, as we have seen, a close reading of the final link of the narrative in both sources reveals profound differences between them. In J, God does not speak to human beings after the Flood; He only makes the promise within Himself. Noah and his sons do not know of it, and it is made known to the subsequent generations (if at all) only indirectly. The promise‐oath that follows the Flood in the Jahwist document does, it is true, reflect a certain turn in God’s manner of behaving toward human beings. Until this point, in J, God finds Himself in confrontation and competition with human beings; He perceives them as a threat and attempts to limit them.93 However, from the reason that He gives here, it follows a certain bitterness and lack of conciliation.</p>
         <p>This is not the case in the final stage of the plot in the Priestly document. Here God addresses Noah directly and repeats the words He said to Adam at the time of his creation: He again gives Noah dominion over all living creatures and over the earth, He blesses him with fruitfulness, and reminds him (or even informs him)94 that human beings are made in His image. God’s reconciliation with human faults in P is complete. Unlike J, in P, God is willing to contain human beings. Not only does He address Noah without explicitly blaming him for his imperfect nature, but also He establishes mechanisms to prevent a similar colossal catastrophe in the future. The first means He uses is a new normative order, intended to prevent total corruption of humankind in the future (and indirectly prevent outbursts of God’s anger), while the second means, the bow in the clouds, is a mechanism for controlling His own anger. P therefore implies an internal personality process that occurs within God, from the Creation until after the Flood, which involves a certain sobering and recognition not only regarding human beings but also in relation to God Himself. This self‐recognition allows the creation of mechanisms that will ensure self‐control on the day of anger. J contains no mention of similar mechanisms, and the “intra‐Divine” processes bear a different character. God is lacking in self‐awareness, or, at most, it is very partial.95</p>
         <p>Unlike the view, widespread among many scholars of the Priestly document, regarding the dryness, formalism, and legalism of the priestly authors, indicating its distance from myth and its tendency to make God sublime (and even abstract), the analysis suggested here for the Flood narrative in P presents an opposite picture.96 Indeed, one must not confuse form or style with contents; behind the dry and objective stylistic wrapping, there pulses a sensitive and dynamic Divine heart. Moreover, the emotional complexity of the Priestly God is no less complex—at least in the chapters of P in Genesis—than the externalized emotionality of the God of J (and may be even greater than it).97</p>
         <p>At the same time, there seems to have been an importance to the manner of expression used in the Priestly source that goes beyond the aesthetic; its tone and nuance also bore a theological message. Although the dynamic of “Divine emotion” in P follows clearly from the text, particularly in the section on the rainbow (affecting the Flood narrative as a whole), the Priestly author seems not to have emphasized it. Although for him as well, the rainbow is clearly a means of controlling anger, he refers to it using allusive and indirect language. It may be that out of respect for the Divine honor, P refrained from revealing the full range of this divine emotion, expressing himself in formal and ceremonial language that preserved something of the Divine transcendence. This delicacy in P’s manner of expression is striking in comparison with the approach of the Rabbinic sages. The straightforward and at times even sharp language of the Midrashic and Aggadic authors regarding anthropopathic matters contrasts strongly to the allusive and deliberately vague style of the priestly author. This literary‐theological tendency (or reticence) helped to conceal, from the eyes of commentators throughout the generations, the element of Divine emotion in the P version of the Flood narrative.</p>
         <p>A considerable part of the differences between the final chapter of the Flood narrative in P and that in J is rooted in the profound gap between them at the very beginning, in the story of Creation. The main difference between these two Creation narratives—that dictates to a significant extent the continuation of the plot further along in the two sources—lies in their descriptions of the creation of human beings. The Priestly document describes human beings as created by God in His image; the Jahwist document provides contradictory characterizations of their creation. I hope to elaborate elsewhere on these differences and their profound relationship to the story of the Flood, particularly to its end, in P on the one hand and in J on the other.</p>
         <p>But even without relating to the roots of the narrative in these two documents, the new‐old reading proposed here for the chapter of the covenant and the rainbow bears far‐reaching implications for the nature of the message (or lesson) of the Flood narrative as a whole. The story indicates the corrupt nature of the human being; God’s tremendous destructive power, paralleled only by His power to create and to shape; and the traumatic experience undergone by humankind in the primeval past, when it was almost wiped off the face of the earth in a colossal deluge. The Flood is the archetype of the catastrophe that befalls humankind as a whole (as opposed to the catastrophes of individuals). On the face of it, the message of the Flood story is that the world as such is in danger and that the continuity of its existence—both of human beings and of all those connected with them, the earth and the living creatures (i.e., “civilization”)—is not self‐evident. The Flood would also seem to imply within it a basic theological insight, connecting God with destructive powers and with the “Day of Judgment.”98</p>
         <p>Indeed, according to the usual reading of the chapter concerning the covenant and the rainbow, shared by most of the researchers and commentators mentioned above, the Flood narrative in general nevertheless has a calming, soothing, confidence‐inspiring message, one that almost conveys tranquility. The bottom line of the entire story seems to imply that God recognizes the corrupt element within human beings and accepts it; He makes a covenant with violent and fault‐ridden humankind, in which He obligates Himself in a unilateral way—without any corresponding obligation on the part of human beings—never again to bring a flood to destroy the land. In His great mercy, God forgives in advance the unavoidable corruption of mankind. To this covenant He adds a sign of the covenant, for Himself and primarily for human beings—namely, the bow that is stretched between heaven and earth and that symbolizes an eternal‐cosmic reconciliation between the upper and lower worlds. The theology that lies at the basis of this reading assumes God’s goodness and omnipotence—He is not a capricious, dynamic personality, likely to violate a promise. His covenant is firm and not subject to nullification (in the language of Scriptures: “Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent”; 1 Sam. 15:29). According to this reading, the Flood was a catastrophic event in the past, but human beings, even when they are corrupt, may be confident that it will never repeat itself. (The categorical Divine promise also obscures the existential significance of the Flood, which ceases to be a threatening option.) What began as a story of darkness, fear, and destruction concludes as a story of love and unconditional consolation. Even if matters are not formulated thus, this is the message of the Flood story in its widespread reading. Most modern commentators, both Christian and Jewish, as well as many of the classical ones, share in it as well.99</p>
         <p>This is not the case regarding the interpretation offered here of the covenant and the rainbow and their underlying theological assumptions (and on the basis of the Creation‐Flood narrative a whole). According to this interpretation, due to the Divine emotion and psychology that move it, the story of the Flood in general creates a balance of terror between the corrupt and violent element within human beings and the Divine anger that threatens them, and the Divine promise‐covenant based on mechanisms of control of His wrath and His explosive jealousy. Precisely because the covenant, and more than that, the bow, are not only expressions of Divine love but also (to the contrary) tools for control of His anger and fury—which are, as we said, part of the nature of the Divine emotion—these are not only a cause for complacency and calm but also a source for worry and fear, lest He be unable to prevent His anger from bursting forth once again.</p>
         <p>The Flood story therefore bears a complex message. To the same extent that it is calming, it also warns; insofar as it inspires confidence, it also arouses fear. It seems to me that, by shedding light on the emotional‐personality aspect of God in the story of the Flood, we may clarify the source of this fear. The analysis offered above regarding the promise‐covenant, and particularly of the sign of the covenant—that is, the bow—indicates that one is not speaking of a promise that will necessarily hold fast (like a natural law). In the final analysis, the jealous God requires some means to help Him to remember His covenant and to restrain Himself. The situation of humankind after the Flood, in terms of the danger of total destruction in the future, has, it is true, improved: God has made a covenant and created the mechanism of the rainbow to stop Himself. But precisely because of the nature of the Divine emotion that has been uncovered in this narrative, there is no assurance that the promise will not be violated. For, as we said, God Himself fears that He will not be able to stand up to it and thus creates a mechanism of self‐control. At the very basis of this emotional‐personality element (which is not fixed and is always surprising) lies the distinction between the reading proposed here for the story of the Flood and that accepted by the majority of interpreters and scholars. This element shapes, in a dramatic fashion, the “message” of the story both in the Jahwist document and even more so in the Priestly one.</p>

               <p>I do not claim by this that divine anger‐management devices are unique to P. As we saw above (sect. IV), they also exist in J and in E (e.g., in Exodus 32).</p>

               <p>This insight is evidently shared by all the ancient foundational myths that include any version of the Flood narrative.

               <p>See, for example, Westermann (<italic>Genesis</italic>, 399, 473), who writes: “God’s word, God’s assurance guarantees the continuation of the world and every living creature, and takes precedence over every theology” (ibid., 471). A similar formulation appears among many other commentators (see his references therein).</p>
