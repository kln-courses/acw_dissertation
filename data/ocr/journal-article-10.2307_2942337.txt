[iii], 68, 27.</page><page sequence="2">396 FAR EASTERN QUARTERLY This sample product from one of the best-known dictionary projects in sinol- ogy deals exclusively with the character tzu - and terms and phrases be- ginning with it. Tzu is Radical number 39, hence the title, Fascicle 39.0.1. During the past decade the project has suffered from the war and from changes in personnel. This Fascicle may be thought of as a fresh start, since its edi- torial scheme differs radically from the one exemplified in Professor Y. R. Chao's Specimen Articles (1942). It attempts, as its preface states, "to regis- ter all known meanings of the character tzu with supporting quotations from ancient, medieval or modem texts," with "the sources... carefully indicated and the quotations... provided with an English translation." It is based on a vast collection of data assembled since 1936 from sixteen dictionaries and lexicons, ancient and modem, in Chinese, Japanese, and English. By 1942 about 1,500,000 items were reported to have been gathered. The present Fas. cicle grew from a segment of this mass, plus quotations added by various scholars who have been connected with the project. Professor William Hung, who directed the collecting of the materials in Peking in 1936, is chief editor of the Fascicle, in collaboration with such distinguished members as Achilles Fang, and others of the group at Harvard. The present Fascicle does not give the impression that it is part of a dic- tionary, in form or in spirit. Rather it is an extensive treatise on tzu, chosen for demonstration since it is one of the Chinese words richest in connotations. Realizing this, we are more in a position to exempt the Fascicle from a few of the formal limitations of a dictionary, and to appreciate some of the subtle discussions it contains, the bibliographical acumen of the editors, and the im- mense supply of lexical materials at their disposal. Many of the long quota- tions do far more than illustrate a given expression; they are concerned with such special areas of usage as historiography (e.g., p. [7), geography(p. 27), and the monetary system (p. 49). Often intricate points in textual criticism are dealt with, if not always conclusively, at least provocatively. It is only when one is reminded that the Fascicle is "a very small part of a potential unabridged dictionary" that one begins to wonder whether all this may not be too hairsplitting or too rambling for a dictionary. Perhaps some such feeling exists on the part of the editors, too, and perhaps a resulting at- tempt at discrimination and selection is responsible for the strange unbalance of the entries. Or is it due to lack of personnel, lack of printing space, or lack of time in which to agree upon a basic principle or formula? It is often difficult to know, particularly in the case of compounds, why repetitious items appear, while others of equal or greater importance have been left out. Under some headings detailed arguments are presented, but under others there are less than adequate explanations or oversights in translation. The Fascicle contains four main parts: A. Graphic Variants; B. Phonological Variants; C. Semantic Diversities; D. Combinations beginning with tzu. Fifty-seven different written forms for tzu are given under A. These are called only a "selection" but for the practical purposes of a dictionary it would probably have been adequate to list even fewer, indicating only the im-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 397 portant stages in their orthographical evolution with brief comments on each. The lack of a standard script in ancient times and centuries of changing calli- graphic style have natural ly given tzu, one of the most frequently used char. acters, a high number of graphic variants. The search for these has gone be- yond the huge corpus of authentic oracle-bone, bronze, and later tile in'scrip- tions to include forged pieces and spurious readings as well. Indeed, one large portion of this section is devoted to a meticulous consideration of three pos- sible cases of forged oracle-bone inscriptions, and two cases where t'ienX, "heaven," or ta k, "tgreat," seem to have been misread for tzu. There is a welcome presentation of the two widely divergent archaic forms of tzu, originally distinguished by different meanings and usages: one the "first sign of the duodecimal series" (e.g., in chia-tzu), the other "child," but also for ssu a, "sixth sign of the duodecimal series." Evidence for the merger of the two forms cannot be traced earlier than A.D. 9, but even so serves to ex- plain some confused and hybrid forms appearing later. More importantly, the merger justifies to some extent the ingenious but dubious philological specula- tions in Hsi Shen's M1Rt Shuo-wen S (ca. A.D. 121) on the etymology of tzu. The editors leave the exact dating of and the reason for this very curious merger to "future research," citing for reference in the meantime, three works by Chinese and Japanese philologists. These are in the area of what we might call "speculative philology," upon which the Fascicle itself often enters in a stimulating way. Section B first summarizes the romanization of Mandarin tzu in various Chinese and European systems, and contrasts tzu with other pronunciations not only in the Chinese dialects but also in Japanese, Annamese and Korean. The bulk of this section deals with the reconstruction of the ancient and ar- chaic pronunciations. It is a remarkably exhaustive survey of the problems raised by conflicting theories in the field of Chinese phonology, with meticu- lous references to volume and page of each work cited. One might wish, how- ever, that after so much effort the results had somehow been arranged into at least some semblance of dictionary form, instead of being scattered among discursive and digressive remarks, between hundreds of barely decipherable bracketed numerals and initials. A student particularly interested in phonology will, however, find the deciphering eminently worth his while as an index to practically all he might want to know about tzu. Under C, thirty "semantic diversities" are categorized. Quotations sup- porting the meanings generally follow chronological order. The differences be- tween some of the categories are basic, e.g., tzu as "1. child," and "26. first of the duodenary cyclical characters." Others are clearly secondary, e.g., "11. eggs," and "13. seed, kernel, grain." Still others take into account grammatical function, e.g., "8. verbal use," and "9. adverbial use," or are figurative, e.g., "18," rather dubiously termed "a sort of pronominal adjec- tive." It might have been useful to remind the user of the dictionary that these "semantic diversities" are often due only to several different translations being possible in different contexts, and that the Chinese word tzu itself does not embrace such a variety of different concepts.</page><page sequence="4">398 FAR EASTERN QUARTERLY These many classifications and sub-classifications are characteristic of the meticulous spirit of the work. A good illustration of this spirit is "10. the young of animals," under which come the sub-classifications "1) of mam- mals," with illustrative sentences regarding cows, deer, rabbits and tigers; "2) of birds"; "3) of fishes"; and "4) of insects." This list of illustrations might have been extended to cover the whole animal kingdom, but in every case the basic concept of tzu still would be "baby, child, offspring, issue." To render tzu in one case as "calf" and in another as "cub," as is done in this part of the Fascicle, may seem to accomodate biological fact, but it is really neither literally accurate nor contextually cogent. It is important to note that most of the examples here are from ancient texts, particularly from the Book of Odes and the Analects. It is very doubtful whether the ancient Chinese used tzu with so much biological discrimination, especially in poetry and proverbial sayings, where animals tend to be anthropomorphic. Hence the translation of lU-niu chib tzu Vt;4tX# as "calf of a brindled cow" (Lun YE 3.12a, quoted under 10:1) on closer examination proves misguided. In context, tzu is intended to suggest the child-parent or offspring-ancestor relationship rather than that of calf to cow. In fact, the zoological connotation is probably precisely what the proverbial saying is trying to avoid. Otherwise, tu 40, "calf," might well have been used instead of tzu. In Legge's translation of the phrase, quoted in the Fascicle, tzu rendered as "calf" is incongruous; in Waley's' it is judi- ciously changed to "offspring," which suits the sense perfectly. In cases like this, one cannot but regretfully conclude that the thirty varieties of "semantic diversities" have sometimes been elaborated to excess, so much so that the "meanings" have, after all this hairsplitting, become artificial and unsupport- able. In section D, "Combinations beginning with tzu," about 430 terms and phrases are treated as entries. A detailed discussion would require too much space, but a general description is almost impossible because in quality and merit they form the most uneven part of the work. This would be expected to be the most important part of the dictionary but it is so hastily and bewilder- ingly put together that a reviewer, even after careful study, finds it difficult to tell the reader exactly what to look for in it, or even what kind of information he will find under an entry. Comprehensive as the work professes to be, no one should expect that every "combination" will be included, or all the information about each. But the criteria, if any, for selecting the entries, are most puzzling, as is the disparity 'In Analects 6.4 Confucius says of Chung-kung that he should be employed by the state on his own merits despite his obscure origin, or his father's alleged defects, just as a sacrificial victim should be selected for its own uniform color and horns, even though it might have sprung from a brindled parent. Since the allusion is to the able son of a useless father, the metaphor should obviously be rendered "offspring of an as," as in Waley, The Analects of Confucius (London, 1938) 116, not "calf of a cow," because the victim selected was not to be young, and the parent alluded to was by logic male. Legge, in fact, tried to correct in his note the wrong impression given by his translation; see Legge, The Chinese Classics. 1.186.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 399 in their extent and manner of treatment. Some of the detailed discussions are very fine and impressive, for instance, that on the possible ancient location of an obscure district, Tzu-ch'eng -T; (pp. 26"27), or the broad coverage of historical incidents in relation to the monetary term tzu mu hsiang-ch'flan 4FRIiM(pp. 48.50). But these are so few and far between that they stand in glaring contrast to the paucity of information under a large majority of other entries which are of equal if not greater importance. This raises the question why those few terms should have received so much attention that much of the expatiation is no longer lexical information but rather in the nature of emenda- tion, conjecture and anecdote. In contrast to the extensive discussion accorded Tzu-ch'eng, for many other place names we are simply told, "name of a place," "name of a hill," or "'name of a town," and no more. For instance, of Tzu-wu-ku-E-*16, a place of much greater historical, geographic and literary interest than Tzu-ch'eng, we are simply told "name of a road." We cannot say, however, that the Fascicle consistently casts light on the obscure, for on such less familiar namesas Tzu-ch'i-lei A or Tzu-ying-kou-T MlT , it is just as laconic. Similarly, of scores of book titles, such as the Tzu-shou shih ch/ao -gijMP, or the Tzu Liu.tzu hsing.chuang ?V'J-:TLA, or such and such chi Vf or pien A, we are simply told, "title of a book," with no mention of authorship or subject matter. Why these titles are included, we do not know, nor why others, equally familiar or rare, are left out. Personal names are treated quite differently; in all cases identifications are briefly made. What follows, however, is not a biographical sketch, but quotations from historical or literary texts where the name has appeared. This is apparently after the manner of the P'ei-wen yin-fu, so that the literary con- notations of the name may be exemplified. This is quite legitimate, for in some important instances these names are bound up with symbolic or figurative ex- pressions comparable to "Caesar's wife" or "Gordian knot." But the selec- tion of the names seems haphazard. Nor are they all treated on the same prin- ciple. Tzu-chang and Tzu-hsia, names of Confucius' disciples, are here, com- plete with literary quotations; Tzu-yu, however, is entered merely as "second- ary name of Yen Yen..., a disciple of Confucius." If this name, cited, from Shih chi 67, was included even though it had occasioned no literary allusions, then the absence of dozens of other disciples' secondary names beginning with Tzu, some of which are perhaps even more important, is inexplicable, e.g., Tzu-yfian, of the great Yen Hui (also in Shib chi, same chapter), Tzu-yi, of Tseng Shen (not entered, even though it is also the secondary name of Men- cius), and many others, including Tzu-chien+T , which does occur in many famous allusions. Of the literary figures, Tzu-mei (Tu Fu) is of course here, but why not Tzu-chien fTII (Ts'ao Chih), which has become an integral part of just as many literary conceits? More curious is the absence of Tzu-yfin fe (Yang Hsiung), a name equally great and just as germane to literary idioms, while Tzu-wu, that of his son, known only as a precocious boy who died very young, occupies a one-line entry.</page><page sequence="6">400 FAR EASTERN QUARTERLY Some combinations happen to be both common nouns and personal or place names. It is at least poor format that under #9, with slight differentiation by hyphens and capital letters in the romanization, such unrelated meanings should be lumped together as "l. ... Ovary... 2.... Small room ... 3.... Sec- ondary name of Chang Liang .. ," just as if under "pole" in an English dic- tionary we were to find "1. a slender piece of wood... 2. extremity... 3. a native of Poland.... ," with their etymological differences not considered. Among other such terms tzu.mingrnJR is defined as "old term for quick-silver" and "a sobriquet of the mulberry tree," and Tzu-shan #LL as "name of a scenic place," but the fact that both are also the names of several great his- torical figures is not noted. Under Tzu-hsi-t'ai we find, "Two places under this name," without mention of the fact that it derives from the name of the famous Wu Tzu-hs5 fh TiW. Even though Tzu-ching Tf is the secondary name of more than one important person, it is noted as only that of Wang Hsien-chih. Speculation is normally not the concern of a dictionary, but the Fascicle and its interests are all-embracing, and its editors prone to tackle the most ab- struse questions, however tentatively and inconclusively. An extreme example occurs on page 19, where the expression tzu tan #YI- is so tortuously treated as to become one of the longest entries. It is tta term," the long column says, "which occurs once (and possibly twice) in the bizarre and cryptic text of HTNCYC" [= T'ai-shang huang-t'ing nei-ching yri-ching - a text of a Taoist cult]. The expression is tentatively defined as "little cinna- bar," but a number of equally "bizarre and cryptic" occult passages are cited which contradict rather than support this meaning. A user of a dictionary may very well wonder why such an obscure term, occurring only "once (and pos- sibly twice)" in a "bizarre and cryptic" text of a particular cult should be in- cluded and discussed at such length, especially since as a result the question of whether tzu tan here is "little cinnabar" or a personal name becomes more involved than solved. The approximately 430 "combinations" have been drawn from sixteen major lexicons and a large mass of other data, but among these sources, the Pei-wen yun-fu alone contains about 580 items beginning with tzu. In quantity, there- fore, section D is far from all-inclusive. We might then expect the limited num- ber of entries in the Fascicle to have been so selected and treated as clearly to illustrate and explain the varied functions of tzu in compounds. But unin- formative, repetitious entries such as "place name" and "book title" do not bear out this expectation, and, indeed usurp the place of more significant material. The preface states that "historical principles" would be followed in ex- plaining basic and derived meanings for tzu and its compounds. To a certain extent this was done, as for example with such entries as tzu.sun f* and tzu tidy-, and occasionally there is valuable information as in the instance of tzu mei T4X, "sons," which is traced to the early translation of a Mongo- lian term in the Yfian-ch'ao pi-shih it-9 . But in many cases merely an English translation or a rough equivalent is given for a term, with a single</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 401 source indicated which is far from revealing. For example, tzu-nen -fdT is translated "tender," and the only source given is Giles' Chinese-Englisb Dictionary (1912); for tzu-hsifT#, translated "daughter-in-law," we are re- ferred to Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary (1931). These raise a disturb- ing question: should a reader, promised the benefit of "historical principles," think that the history of these expressions began, respectively, about 1912 or 1931, and that each originated in a foreign language dictionary? Or were they vagaries of slang or dialect? If so, they should be identified as such, with il- lustrations of their usage. Phrases originate anywhere but in dictionaries. If, with all the facilities of the Harvard Dictionary Project, these two expressions in the senses as translated can be found nowhere but in these two diction- aries, then there must be something wrong either with the expressions or with the dictionaries. This is intended neither as carping nor as a witticism, but citation of his- torical sources in a dictionary is too valuable a method to be employed with- out sufficient care, especially in view of the long time-span of the Chinese language. Practically any two or more Chinese characters can be put together with a variety of possible meanings, but whether they are legitimate "com- binations" must be decided by historical precedent, the conditions of their employment, and frequency of occurrence. Knowing exactly when and in what context an expression appeared is basic to distinguishing its exact sense. Otherwise how can one determine whether tzu-nen, here simply translated "tender," refers to the tenderness of meat or of feeling, which in Chinese are vastly different expressions? And one would have to be convinced that tzu-hsi may not mean "son and daughter-in-law" as well, particularly since we know that the two dictionaries quoted often contain odd mistakes. Finally, we must note that the translations, certainly a most important part of a Chinese-English dictionary, leave much to be desired. Many of them seem to have come straight from the raw files of the Project. There are instances of rough equivalents, as indicated above, and of arbitrary glossing. Shib 34, in connection with Confucius' disciple Tzu-hsia, is translated "poetry." The historical source cited is Lun-y12, the Analects. It is debatable when the word shib came to mean poetry in the general sense, but it certainly does not mean that in the Analects, where in all twelve occurrences it means the corpus of the Odes known in Confucius' time. It cannot be translated "poetry," any more than could the "Book of Psalms." One of the meanings given for tzu-mo ff is "4. Literature," based on two lines of poetry: pu te mao-chui li /ylian fei tzu-mo hsiu TI -&amp;JcXjj fj i which in the Fascicle are translated: "[These boys, because of illness,] had not taken the examinations; this did not really constitute a disgrace to litera- ture." Elsewhere in the entry, tzu-mo has been rendered literally "master of ink," hence plausibly, "literary man." But tzu-mo rendered as "literature," or mao-chui (hair awl, i.e., writing brush) as "examinations" is no more sup- portable than "test tube" equated with "total warfare." The lines quoted are from Yang Wan-li g9M consoling his sons who had missed the examinations</page><page sequence="8">402 FAR EASTERN QUARTERLY on account of illness. Consistent with the letter and spirit of the sentence, the lines should be rendered: "Not being availed of [a chance to wield] the writing brush/ Is really no disgrace to 'masters of ink' (i.e., literary men)." Translations of poetry may differ widely in wording, but would not the transla- tion in the Fascicle, giving "Literature" for tzu-mo, convey just the wrong idea, as if the father were chiding the sons by hinting that "Literature" could do just as well without them at the examinations? What is most curious is that from this incomprehensible "translation" a lexical meaning should have been taken. Many of the oversights may perhaps be blamed on haste and smallness of staff. But, as we have indicated, other disappointing features involve lexical principles, form and scope. We must think of this worthy dictionary project through its eighteen years of history as a whole, the first-rate talent engaged on it, and the extent of the labor which has been contributed to it. In some of the earlier editorial schemes, particularly the 1942 Specimen Articles, where "rigorous form" was strongly emphasized, we see that an entirely different approach was once considered. The amorphous quality of the Fascicle is itself a revealing commentary on the increasingly heavy multilateral burden of sinol- ogy today. The compilers seem to have attempted to approach lZu from three directions at the same time-first, in the manner of a bilingual dictionary; second, in that of an encyclopedia sinica; and finally, in the spirit of H. L. Mencken's American Language. As we progress in Chinese studies beyond mere surface scratching, and gain greater realization of the richness of Chi- nese culture, the greater our need is for all three approaches. To have at- tempted the three together, with a small staff, is heroic. The severity of some of this reviewer's criticism is matched only by his sincere appreciation of the difficulty of the task, and his good wishes for these distinguished scholars at Harvard.
