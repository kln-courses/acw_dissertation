Introduction Whatever a scholar's philosophical inclination, comparative study - i.e., an inquiry which examines together materials from significantly different cultures (or contexts)1 in order to address issues common to both or particular to one - has to begin with the confidence that reasoning can cross cultural and religious boundaries, penetrate realms of difference, and discover intelli- gibility in different traditions, differences notwithstanding. If reason had no such power, research would not be possible. Yet when we begin to consider particular religious issues, we may be rather more willing to assume that different traditions' teachings are primarily context-specific; if we do not observe carefully how non- Western traditions think about God, for instance, we may be inclined to restrict our comments on religious reasoning to a more abstract level, neither nuancing our own manner of religious thinking nor advancing our reasoned knowledge of God. In order to move forward our understanding of the methods and possible achievements of religious reasoning in a comparative context, this essay introduces a line of reasoning about the existence of God that is commonly presented and debated in three schools of traditional Hindu philosophical theology, logic (Nyaya), ritual theory (MImamsa), and scriptural theology (Vedanta). Although quite different notions of the divine were lively possib- ilities in the ancient Indian context - including polytheism and varieties of monism - the debate which I shall trace here has to do with the idea of a supreme lord, a conscious and all-powerful person who can choose to act in a certain way for certain purposes and who will never be frustrated in the completion of these purposes, i.e., God. In what follows I restrict my consideration to just one among a much larger set of questions: can it be shown persuasively that God exists? Because the logical school known as Nyaya appears to be the most comprehensively and sheerly rational of the Hindu systems, I will begin with</page><page sequence="2">2 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, SJ. the Nyaya argument in favor of the existence of a world-maker. Afterwards I will sketch responses to the Nyaya argument in MImamsa and Vedanta (Visistadvaita) thinkers. In order to point out the crosscultural possibilities of such thinking but also the stubborn complexities that emerge, I will then introduce one Western example of arguing about God, drawing on Richard Swinburne's project of a philosophical theology. Finally, I will indicate some ways in which this kind of comparative study can enhance our thinking about God today. The proof that God is the maker of the world in Nyaya logic The beginnings of the debate over God's existence as a lively topic in Indian philosophical theology are traceable to the philosophical-scientific project of describing comprehensively the entirety of what can be perceived. For although the science-religion debate cannot have developed in India the way it did in the West, nevertheless 'secular' knowledge - natural science, grammar, epistemology - was continually shaping and reshaping Hindu theological debates and demanding from sectarian theologians a public, accessible grounding for their claims. In early Nyaya and in the older empir- icism of the Vaisesika natural philosophers, in the early centuries BCE, it was the project of a complete description of material reality that led to a consideration of whether material reality could be accounted for simply as perceived.2 This quest for an adequate description of empirical reality was undertaken independently of the Buddhists, but it was made more difficult and urgent by the Buddhist rejection of the need for a maker for the universe. Their challenge led the logicians to focus their attention on the fact of God's existence, and only incidentally on the nature of God. The eventual consensus position in Nyaya, refined gradually over a rather long period of time, was that material reality cannot be accounted for without reference to some prior, non- empirical cause. God was therefore posited as an unperceived, inferred cause for what can be perceived, the unseen maker behind what is made. The reader will see that in these sources, 'knowledge' does not refer to 'experience'; while the experience of God is key in a number of Hindu traditions, the debate which I am introducing here has much more to do with an admission of the necessary transition from what we do see to what we judge necessarily behind it.3 The primary form of the Nyaya argument is the cosmological argument, a position which eventually took the following standard form: "The earth, etc., have a maker, because they are effects, like pots."4 If observable realities are best accounted for as the temporal effects of something which precedes them, then it can be confidently claimed that the precedent reality exists; if observ-</page><page sequence="3">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 3 able realities, even very large ones, are best accounted for as constructions, then it can be claimed that their constructor exists. In a sense, the Nyaya logicians' investment in the proof of God's exist- ence is secondary, motivated by their desire to defend a coherent account of empirical reality.5 Later on, proving the existence of God would become a goal in itself and not just a subdivision within the project of accounting for material reality. Some Nyaya texts, most importantly Udayana's great Nydyakusumdfijali, elaborate the proof of God's existence at length and refute objections in great detail. These longer treatments are very important and deserve more study than they have thus far have received, but they are indeed daunting and dense.6 Fortunately, some Nyaya texts offer succinct versions of the proof; the Tarkasamgraha of Annambhatta (17th century) is among the most concise, and I will rely on it to exemplify the argument here.7 Early on the Tarkasamgraha, in the course of listing the various kinds of things (dravya) which can be objects of knowledge, Annambhatta says simply that 'lord' is one of two kinds of self (dtmari), the other being the finite (human) self; he does not argue the point nor consider objections to it, not even the expected objection that God is not some kind of the thing (dravya) at all. But he elaborates a bit in his own Dipikd commentary on the Tarkasamgraha, admitting two objections and then offering his proof for God's existence. The first objection is that this alleged God cannot be perceived. He is nowhere to be seen, nor can he be intuited as one might intuit, rather immediately, that there is a living human consciousness operat- ive 'inside' a perceived and material human body. Second, God's existence cannot be inferred, since there is no similar instance in support of this infer- ence (or induction).8 Inferring the existence of God is like no other inference in human experience, and therefore must be considered dubious. For example, when we see smoke on a distant hill we know that there must be fire there too, since experience tells us that smoke is invariably accompanied by fire. But observation of the world and its many parts does not lead to any similar conclusion, and the fact that there is a world cannot be said to justify the fact of a God. Annambhatta's rejoinder deals quickly with the first objection, since he agrees straightaway that God cannot be perceived. Counter to the second objection, though, he steadfastly though briefly defends the idea that God can be inferred: "Sprouts, etc., are caused by some agent since they are products, like pots. Thus, the existence of the Lord is proved by inference." Neither the living things (like sprouts) nor the inanimate things (like rocks) we see around us in nature are eternal, so they must have had a maker. In the Nrsimhaprakdsikd commentary on the Dipika, Raya Narasimha elaborates this inferential proof.9 He defends the idea that from the fact of an</page><page sequence="4">4 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, SJ. effect we can deduce purposive activity (krti) which implies an agent, and not just a cause (kdrana). Just as it is shown that purposive activity is involved in the making of the world, it can also be shown that will and knowledge are involved. Taken together, purposive action, will, and knowledge define an agent. In the required maximal measure which would describe a world-maker - infinite knowledge, perfect will, ever-successful action - such attributes constitute a definition of an original maker, and it is this maximal figure who is intended when we speak about 'God'. Raya Narasimha defends the reference to a sprout as a specific example of the natural, although sprouts are not clear examples of artifice as are pots, and although we do not actu- ally observe a maker of sprouts. Sprouts are like pots in several important respects, because sprouts too begin to exist, are complex, and require some agency to synthesize them out of simpler elements. Therefore, observation of vegetation such as sprouts can provide a just analogy for the broader claim that everything in the world, and the world itself, has a maker, even if this maker is nowhere to be seen. The general line of reasoning defended by the Nyaya thinkers should be recognizable to those familiar with Western accounts of God, but it remains distinctively Indian in several ways. For instance, reasoning retains a certain empirical element, since logic must be persuasive. If an inference is to be successful, one must find common examples which support the desired results. New, debatable inferences work when they are like other, noncon- troversial inferences which are already known to work. New inferences may well fail if they are shown to be like some other attempted inference which also fails. If we already know that smoke is always accompanied by fire, it counts for something to argue that just as we can infer unperceived fire from perceived smoke, so too we can infer an unperceived maker from a perceived material world. Without the acceptance of positive examples and the rejection of negative examples, the inference is unimaginable and therefore without persuasive effect. Ultimately, then, perception remains the basis for inference. In deciding that the fact of perceptible effects warrants inferring an effi- cient cause and agent, the logicians were at least agreeing on the context and nature of the argument about God. On this they agreed with a variety of interlocutors, including Jains, Buddhists and others who thought that it could not actually be proven that God exists. In this public discourse, although the fundamental value of perception was accepted, there was no consensus on how to think about what was perceived, while verbal testimony (scripture) remained sectarian. Thus, inferential reasoning had to serve as the common ground between empiricism and faith; inference provided arguments which could at least possibly have force across sectarian boundaries.</page><page sequence="5">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 5 The Mimamsa rejection of the inference about God, in the Mdnameyodaya Although Nyaya delves very little into the particularities of religious belief and practice, on epistemological grounds the logicians had a great deal in common with more explicitly and specifically religious traditions. The tradi- tions of Saivism, dedicated to worship of Lord Siva, were for the most part content with the idea that the Lord is the world-maker and with the cosmo- logical argument enunciated in Nyaya, and were sometimes attacked along with Nyaya for these particular reasons.10 Scholars in the Mimamsa ritual tradition and the related Vedanta theological traditions (which were heavily indebted to Mimamsa) accepted many of the same standards of reasoning and likewise desired to stay as close as possible to perception as the norm for proper knowledge. But Mimamsa and Vedanta differed from Nyaya in important ways, even regarding whether inferential reasoning, extrapolated from the perceptible, is really the best basis for religious positions, and here we shall give some attention to these Mimamsa and Vedanta critiques. The Mimamsa ritual theorists and their Vedanta heirs sought to construct their systems primarily on scriptural grounds, and so rejected the idea that knowledge of God's existence, if there is a God, could be the result of a valid inference. Mimamsa itself was largely an atheistic school, although it accepted a ritual polytheism and although later on some of its adherents confessed themselves to be theists.11 But all Mimamsa theorists - theistic and atheistic - agreed that the evidence allegedly supporting the inference about God's existence was ultimately insufficient. Their position is set forth succinctly in the Mdnameyodaya, an introductory manual, of which the first half was written by Narayanabhattatiri around 1590, and the second half by NarayanasudhI a century later.12 Here too, in the second half of the manual, the question of God arises only in the context of describing empirical reality by listing the objects of correct knowledge. The section of ihe Mdnameyodaya on these objects begins with an analysis of divisible substances - earth, water, fire, air, darkness - but then takes up the question of the manner of their synthesis. If these substances are indeed divisible into simpler realities, how are the latter synthesized and held together in at least temporarily enduring forms? The Mdnameyodaya introduces the Nyaya position in keeping with what we saw in the preceding section God is the agent who synthesizes the simplest substances into more complex realities which comprise the universe, and it is God who thereafter breaks them down again. NarayanasudhI cites the familiar Nyaya thesis, "The earth, etc., have a maker, because they are effects," as an adequate representation of the Nyaya position, although he denies its force. In his view, the attempted inference of a maker for the world does not work</page><page sequence="6">6 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, S J. satisfactorily, since one would inevitably get caught in the paradox of whether such a God is embodied or not. Since there is no parallel instance in which we see a maker without a body making material things, the argument cannot be convincing. So too, the admission that the maker has a body would frustrate the logicians' intention, since that body, necessarily finite and composite, would still have to be explained. Indeed, all that we can infer from effects is that each such effect has a cause, not that each separately, nor all together, has a maker. It is one thing to posit that what is not eternal must have a cause; it is quite another, larger task to posit a first agent, a certain kind of person who is the maker of the world. All one can say for certain is that the world has the appearance of an effect or sum of effects, and that each particular effect has cause. There is not sufficient evidence to determine that the whole holds together for some specific reason. In any case, MImamsa is not obliged to provide an alternative and more convincing reason, since ambiguity about beginnings is not a flaw peculiar to the atheist position; even theists, once they have stated that there is a creator, do not explain how or why that creator is supposed to have created this particular world.13 The Vedanta subordination of reason to scripture in the Nydyasiddhdnjana MImamsa skepticism is mirrored in Vedanta exegetical and philosophical theology; this is true whether we considering the Advaita (nondualist) Vedanta tradition of Sankara (8th century) or the Visistadvaita (nuanced nondualist) Vedanta of Ramanuja (11th century) and Vedanta Desika (13th century). Visistadvaita thinkers are strongly monotheistic, devoted to Lord Visnu, but even they accept only scripture as the adequate source of know- ledge of God, even if reason can subsequently be quite useful. Let us briefly examine some features of the Visistadvaita argument as our third Hindu example. Visistadvaita Vedanta shares a theistic worldview with the logicians, and agrees there is a God who is the source of the world. This God is a perfect being, author of the Vedas, giver of liberation. In Visistadvaita Vedanta, though, God is the material cause of the world, and not just an efficient cause who might be inferred simply from the fact that the world is impermanent and clearly a product. This view about material causality is traced back to the upanisads since, like all the Vedanta schools, the Visistadvaita was intent on rooting its viewpoints in the upanisads as the primary source of right reli- gious knowledge. For this reason and due to skepticism about the viability of the proof, the Visistadvaita thinkers refused to share with the logicians a confidence that God's existence could be proven.</page><page sequence="7">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 7 The Visistadvaita position is stated succinctly in the Nyayasiddhahjana of Vedanta Desika.14 Observation of the nature of the world does not lead us to infer that there is a God who is its creator. Precisely because this world is limited and ever-changing, it does not appear to have an omniscient and omnipotent maker as its efficient cause. Were we to agree that a perfect God is the creator of the world, we would then have the right to expect a flawless and perfectly complete world, instead of the imperfect and gradually evolving world we actually observe. Nor is it possible to describe just how the alleged perfect creator is supposed to have created the world; were he perfect in every way, he would not have the specific and limited knowledge, desire, and effort required to created this specific and limited world. Moreover, were we to accept the fact of a created world and a creator, these would have to be in some continuing relationship, a relationship which could not be explained in a way that does justice to both ends of the relationship, the finite and the infinite. Desika goes on the say that one can never deduce the kind of maker that would satisfy the theist. It would not be possible to prove that the world-make has perfect knowledge, since even a non-omniscient person, or groups of such persons, could have fashioned this imperfect world. Contrary to the logicians' hopes, Desika charges, the only maker they could succeed in establishing would be one with a body, since the physical world is most easily explained as made by a physical maker. As did the MImamsa theorists, Desika demands other examples of makers without bodies making material things, and finds none. Ultimately, there is no satisfactory way to prove that this material universe has a maker who does not have a physical body. Indeed, even if one agrees with the Nyaya thinkers that the earth has a cause (kdrana) because it is clearly an effect, one cannot jump to the conclu- sion that there is a maker (kartr) at all. The idea that there is a series of causes (kdrana) can serve as a plausible alternative explanation for the evolution of non-conscious realities, so one is not compelled to conclude that any partic- ular effect, not to mention the 'world' as a whole, depends on one conscious maker (kartr). Even if one were to postulate that effects have not only causes but also makers, this generalization leaves one without any specific insight into the nature of a particular world-maker, and so it is useless. In Desika's eyes, the logicians are naive in imagining a plausible world- maker, since their logical gymnastics do no more than adjust the general notion of 'maker' to fit the needs of making the world, excluding all the defi- ciencies one might ordinarily attribute to a maker. Only by wishful thinking do they end up with the perfect maker they argue for. Despite their enormous investment in logic, they are not actually thinking their way toward a single, simple, adequate idea of God. Only by beginning with scripture, Desika</page><page sequence="8">8 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, S J. believes, can one attain a clear enough idea of God that one could attain a convincing account for the world-maker relationship. While the positions of unbelievers can be refuted by reasoning, the correct view of the God-world relationship must be founded first of all in scripture. Reason's subtle universality The question of God's existence was never resolved even among the Nyaya, MImamsa and Vedanta schools, much less in debate with the Buddhists and Jains; even today the basic positions are still reiterated. Although belief in some single great God (of some particular tradition, with a name such as Visnu or Siva or Devi) became common among Hindu intellectuals, skep- ticism about the cosmological proof has persisted in various circles. The debate remains a classical and to some extent contemporary instance of philo- sophical and theological reasoning in the Indian context, and so too a key, illuminating instance of a rational theology. Due to its general features it can be recognized and analyzed across cultural and religious boundaries. There seems to be no particular reason why non-Hindus and non-Indians cannot understand the positions taken by the Nyaya logicians and their opponents and eventually come to conclusions about which position seems the most convincing; nor indeed does there seem to be any good reason for firmly dividing reasoning about the existence of God into Indian reasoning about God and European reasoning, or Hindu reasoning and Christian reasoning, etc. This is true although the debate reveals distinctive Indian features. As I have noted, for instance the entire argument about God's existence is presen- ted largely as incidental to other discussions, and it is only rather late in the course of the debate that independent treatises on God appear. The task of fashioning a proper inference of God's existence seems by design to be presented as a side issue, subordinate to the task of explaining empirical reality adequately. We have seen too that the structure of inference in the Indian context retains its strong connections to perception, such that 'proof and 'inference' are really kinds of inductions from perceptible evidence. To argue properly, one must constantly be on the lookout for similar examples known from ordinary experience, and one must also be able to neutralize seeming counter-examples. Comparisons matter, since whether a new and disputed point is like some other, accepted point counts in a debate. Indeed, the project seems to be primarily one or persuasion, not proof. In the course of the development of the Indian arguments about God some particular questions and terms of debate did become crucial, though they need not have been so. For example, for reasons that seem due partly to logical</page><page sequence="9">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 9 concerns and partly to the way the debate happened to develop, the argument about a maker of the world is in large part an argument about whether it is possible to imagine a world-maker who lacks a body. So too, it is interest- ing that in the Mdnameyodaya and also in the Vedanta we find a consensus that one can conceive of a series of causes and effects without accepting the additional idea of a maker, an intending, knowing agent. Reengaging the Western Christian debate about God's existence To sketch this strand in the Hindu debate over God's existence has been an ambitious enough project for a short essay, but I wish to conclude by sketch- ing a still larger frame, the profile of a broader comparative inquiry into God's existence which is both descriptive and constructive. If reasoning about God is an enterprise carried on in several religious traditions, and if this reasoning has important features in common from tradition to tradition then, as already suggested, it makes sense to foster an interdisciplinary, crosscultural, and interreligious conversation as a regular part of philosophical and theological reflection on the nature of God, precisely in order that common elements - strengths and weaknesses - can be identified, and secondary issues peculiar to specific cultural settings likewise marked as such. To see how the modern Western consideration of God can be illumin- ated by attention to Indian thinking on the topic, I will draw attention to just one example, the version of the cosmological argument presented by Richard Swinburne, the contemporary Christian philosopher and theologian. Swinburne takes the idea of proof very seriously, uses contemporary scientific and philosophical analysis, and still reaches back into the Western theological and philosophical traditions, so his work offers a useful starting point for a retrieval, in the comparative context, of the Christian, European debate about God. In The Existence of God}5 Swinburne explains his understanding of the cosmological proof, first situating it in relation to the earlier versions of G. W. Leibniz and Samuel Clarke. He begins with the fact that the various states of the universe require some cause - 'G' - and ultimately a full cause. From this it follows, whether the universe is of finite or infinite age, that G is full cause of the existence of the universe throughout its history (with its permanent characteristics). For he is a full cause of each state of the universe, by his making it the case (through some intention of his) that the prior state brought it about, and yet his states are not states of the universe. G would be the cause of the existence of the universe (with its permanent charac-</page><page sequence="10">1 0 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, S.J. teristics) over all the time that it exists, by a series of intentions, or rather a continuing intention to keep it in being. If we are to postulate G we should postulate the simplest kind of G for the purpose, and that means a G of infinite power, knowledge, and freedom, i.e. God . . . The choice is between the universe as stopping-point and God as stopping-point. Can we rest with the universe as a brute, inexplicable fact? Thereafter he concludes that the supposition that there is a God is an extremely simple supposition; the postulation of a God of infinite power, knowledge, and freedom is the postulation of the simplest kind of person which there could be ... If something has to occur unexplained, a complex physical universe is less to be expected than other things (e.g., God).16 With this appeal to simplicity, Swinburne echoes a value common to Indian intellectual discourse as well: simpler arguments are to be preferred over those which are more complex. It is simpler to conclude that there is a God than to draw some alternate conclusion. But Swinburne also admits that the probability favoring such a God is not equaled by the probability that such a God, were one to exist, would in fact have actually created this world. At the end of the chapter on the cosmological argument he sums up his estimate of the probabilities in this way: There is quite a chance that if there is a God he will make something of the finitude and complexity of a universe. It is very unlikely that a universe would exist uncaused, but rather more likely that God would exist uncaused, the existence of a universe is strange and puzzling. It can be made comprehensible if we suppose that it is brought about by God.17 Like the Nyaya logicians, Swinburne has received much criticism from other philosophers of religion and theologians. In Does God's Existence Need Proof?™ Richard Messer notes the considerable resistance to Swinburne's rationalistic approach to theology. Both ordinary believers and respectable philosophers and theologians may hold the view that 'god' is not something to be proven or disproven, particularly outside some living faith context. Some consider the project of a cosmological argument to be mistaken, as Messer suggests in words that echo the concerns of MImamsa and Vedanta thinkers: "The Cosmological Argument fails for similar reasons as the Teleological. It misconstrues God as a creator in the way that an all-powerful human being might be creator; in other words, it commits gross anthropomorphism with relation to God. Moreover, Hume showed conclusively how it is impossible to infer God from the world in any fashion at all. An argument of an a posteriori</page><page sequence="11">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 1 1 kind can only be inconclusive - there are always other possible explanations of any of the phenomena of our experience - and so God is reduced to the status of an uncertain hypothesis."19 One of Messer's primary concerns is to contrast Swinburne's way of think- ing about God with D.Z. Phillips' Wittgensteinian approach, according to which empiricist and rationalist explications of God's existence are deeply rooted in their cultural and linguistic setting and unlikely even to be intelli- gible, much less persuasive, outside that setting. Although Messer strives to observe Swinburne and Phillips from a neutral stance, he does seem to favor Phillips insofar as he emphasizes how irretrievably far apart Phillips and Swinburne are, even when they seem to be arguing about the same issues. Considered from some angles, reasoning seems not to provide an indubitable basis for conversations about God. Nevertheless, although Swinburne's rich and subtle arguments need to be examined and debated extensively in order to be justly assessed, his project and its methods are clear enough that they are accessible even to those who disagree not only with his conclusions but even with the very idea of such a project. Because he is so heavily reliant on reasoning, Swinburne is a Chris- tian thinker who can be drawn into the Hindu conversation about God, just as the Hindu logicians can be appealed to in support of Swinburne's argu- ment with philosophers of religion in a Western context that is still largely Christian. In important ways, Swinburne and the Nyaya logicians do indeed think alike, for they agree that a sound inference should be compelling for all thoughtful persons, regardless of specific cultural, philosophical, and reli- gious peculiarities, and that a convincing inference can be made from the world as we perceive it to a divine maker whom we do not perceive. It turns out that Annambhatta anticipated Swinburne's conclusions, while Swinburne confirms Annambhatta's expectations. But of course nothing is definitively proven about God and God's exist- ence simply by noticing that Swinburne and Nyaya logicians think about God's existence in similar terms. Although Swinburne and the logicians seems to agree, it does not necessarily follow that they also succeed in demonstrating the probability of God's existence. Both could be wrong, or both irrelevant. Perhaps others, e.g., MImamsa ritual theorists in India, David Hume in the West, are correct. In today's intellectual context, where religious thinking has become ever more technically refined and yet also ever more pluralistically differentiated, it is profitable not just to examine Indian arguments or Western Christian arguments about God. One must bring the Nyaya logicians and Richard Swinburne into conversation, and one must also interrogate both regarding the problems raised by Messer and Phillips along with their hitherto unexpected</page><page sequence="12">1 2 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, S J. allies, the Mimamsa and Vedanta thinkers. Broadening the conversation may at first unsettle expected and stylized conversations about God, as old debates and standard positions are disrupted by new alliances and new criticisms. In the long run, though, recognition of important similarities and intellectual issues that are not confined by certain linguistic, cultural, or religious bound- aries will deepen and clarify our understanding of the positions in question, aid us in ruling out side issues which are merely peculiar to specific cultural settings, and possibly, for those so inclined, strengthen the articulation and defense of the positions themselves. Toward a unified debate about God At the beginning of this essay I made two somewhat obvious claims: that it is necessary to assume that reasoning across religious boundaries is possible, and that the nature and implications of reasoning inevitably become promin- ent in comparative study, as an object of study and a strong resource which then has religious import across various religious and cultural boundaries. It means something, religiously and for scholars of religion, that we can think and seem to understand each other, other differences notwithstanding. The case presented in this essay should illustrate both the plausibility and incompleteness of such claims, thus far. On the one hand, the Indian argument about God, in its broad features, is general enough that one cannot label it peculiarly Indian. The fact that a mode of argumentation about God known from the West also flourished in traditional India makes it more plausible to continue to take seriously the arguments about God's existence, since the project of showing that there is a God is not peculiar to certain contested strands of pre-modern and modern Western Christianity. On the other hand, while the argument - "the earth, etc., have a maker, because they are effects, like pots" - is basic and bare enough, as it is argued it is very much inter- twined with the details of Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta, and we need to study it in context. Only after a more prolonged combination of philosoph- ical and comparative study, therefore, will we able to make a more complete comparison with the cosmological argument as embedded in the details of one or another Western philosophical theology. If this instance of thinking about God's existence can be taken as emblematic of a wider set of ways of thinking theologically which cross religious boundaries, then three additional points deserve consideration, even if they cannot be fully argued in this context. First, we can engage more appreciatively the interplay between generalization and particularity in the formulation of religious ideas. One can generalize arguments shared across boundaries and propose interreligious versions of the argument in favor of</page><page sequence="13">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 1 3 God's existence while, at the same time, still having to engage in a kind of detective work which traces every reasonable religious statement back to specific religious and cultural roots which are not general or universal. Philosophical theologians and specialists in particular traditions can therefore cooperate in assessing theological arguments in their original contexts and as possibly viable beyond them.20 Once we are aware of specific Indian instances of the more general cosmo- logical argument, we can also more clearly identify distinctive, local aspects of the theological reasoning about God which has been put forward in the Christian tradition. It is interesting, for example, to see Messer agree with Phillips in discerning religious and apparently Biblical roots for the cosmolo- gical argument: "It is ... unsurprising that the Cosmological Argument arose, coming at a time when the whole world could be seen as God's creation."21 This may well be the case regarding standard European treatments of the cosmological argument, but it should be clear by now that the argument need not have any such connection. Even in the preliminary form under- taken here, comparative study shows us that the cosmological argument - and the arguments against it - have flourished in other religious settings which have nothing to do with the Bible or its Enlightenment critics. Yet it is still possible to assert, despite religious differences which differentiate the Hindu and Christian traditions, that theologians in both traditions have argued versions of the cosmological argument. Second, just as comparative study requires at least a minimal confidence in the universal power of reason, so too comparative study poses certain challenges to reasoning on religious topics. While there may be issues which are unique to particular traditions, it is nevertheless likely that most of what counts as theological thinking is shared across religious boundaries. Since similarity in methods, topics and conclusions undercuts claims to theological uniqueness, the project of philosophical theology is most sensibly undertaken in a context that remains open to the comparative process, as similarities and differences in various cultural renderings of the same topics are consist- ently noted and taken into account. Regarding issues such as the existence of God, some Hindu theologians and some Christian theologians are in many important respects simply colleagues who may instruct, advise and correct one another, agreeing or disagreeing, with respect to particular aspects of human thinking about God. It therefore does not seem sensible on intellectual grounds at least, for philosophically alert theologians to frame their thinking entirely within just one tradition's boundaries, concepts, vocabulary, styles. By making this last point, it is not my intention to make the more contentious claim that all theologians should take up new fields of profes- sional competence and become comparativists. Rather, I am suggesting that</page><page sequence="14">1 4 FRANCIS X. CLOONEY, S. J. reasoning about God and the study of reasoning about God, even when under- taken within a specific tradition, need to remain open at their margins, so as to remain vulnerable to confirmation and/or modification based on what is learned by attention to similar forms of the same arguments as worked through in other cultural and religious contexts. Comprehensive examina- tions of reasoning about God, and efforts to understand what is meant by claims such as, 'God exists', or 'The following claims about God's nature are reasonable . . . ', will be best undertaken as collaborative ventures across disciplinary and religious boundaries, involving scholars in different religious traditions and in different parts of the world, since none of us will be able to master even several of the traditions which must ultimately be brought into the conversation.22 Third, this more open-ended and collaborative study of God is worth the effort for those who wish to maximize what we can know about God by reasoning. If many Hindus and Christians (among others) have taken the cosmological argument seriously and assert that God exists because the world would not otherwise be intelligible, comparative inquiry promises to teach us something more about God and about how believers can understand the world as dependent upon God. If reasoning about God is shared across religious boundaries, then the consensus seen to emerge among many religious thinkers who otherwise share no historical or scriptural sources may help (some of) us to know more certainly whether or not God really does exist.

Notes 1. Such differences are usually pertain to cultures from disparate parts of the world and to religious traditions with disparate sources and histories, though of course a certain kind of comparative study can be done with materials from different times periods, or different strata of society, within a culture. 2. On the origins of the debate about the existence of God in the empirical traditions, see Johannes Bronkhorst, 'God's Arrival in the Vaisesika System', Journal of Indian Philosophy 24 (1996): 281-394. 3. The debate over God's existence is in fact the product of an interreligious conversation - or debate - which demands of its sectarian participants that they step out from the familiar ground of their beliefs and give reasons for or against the existence of God.</page><page sequence="15">THE INTERRELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF REASONING ABOUT GOD' S EXISTENCE 1 5 George Chemparathy points out that a key source for the Nyaya consideration of God lies in the Buddhist critique of God's existence, particularly in the Pramdnavdrttika of Dhar- maklrti (7th century): "Leaving aside the other aspects of the Isvara doctrine he centered his offensives against the Nyaya- Vaisesika proofs for the existence of Isvara, and this, too, from the aspect of their logical validity He argued that the proofs advanced by the Nyaya- Vaisesika theists to establish the existence of Isvara were vitiated by logical falla- cies and that consequently they were incorrect or invalid. He even went further and called into question the very possibility of establishing the existence of Isvara by arguments, since in his view the very conception of an eternal cause, as the Nyaya- Vaisesika theists assume Isvara to be, implies a contradiction." George Chemparathy, An Indian Rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nydyakusumdnjali, p. 78. On the development of the argument about God in the Buddhist context, see Roger Jackson, 'Dharmaklrti's refuta- tion of theism', Philosophy East and West 36 (1985): 315-348. Dharmaklrti's critique of the argument from effects to the existence of God is described briefly in Gerhard Oberhammer, 'Der Gottesbeweis in der Indische Philosophic', Numen 12 (1965): 1-34, esp. 10-22. On the Nyaya debate in general, see the comprehensive introductory essay, 'Study on the Development of Nyaya theism', in John Vattanky's Gangesa's Philosophy of God (Madras: The Adyar Library and Research Centre, 1984), pp. 3-150. A useful summation of the entire range of Indian arguments against the existence of God is given in Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya's Indian Atheism: A Marxist Analysis (New Delhi: People's Publishing House, 1980). 4. George Chemparathy explains: "With the term 'maker' is meant an agent that employs or directs the class of causes that are known to be able to produce the effect. The 'maker' that is postulated here as the cause of 'earth etc' is not just any agent, but one that can adequately account for the existence of the effect in question" (An Indian Rational Theology, p. 86). 5. Gerhard Oberhammer stresses the a posteriori nature of the cosmological proof of God's existence; the Nyaya proof has to do with what can and must be deduced from perceptible reality; see Oberhammer. In fact, the oldest Nyaya discussion, found in the Nyaya Sutras 4.1.19-21, is nothing but a consideration of a God as one of the possible explanations for how complex finite realities are made from simple, atomic ones. 6. The entire Nyayakusumanjali has recently been translated by N.S. Dravid, Nyayaku- sumdnjali of Udayandcdrya (New Delhi: Indian Council of Philosophical Research, 1996). Another weighty presentation of the Nyaya position is Gangesa's 'Discourse on God' , the Isvaravdda section of his Cintdmani, which in translated in Vattanky. 7. The Tarkasamgraha with the Dipika has been translated and amply annotated by Swami Virupaksananda (Madras: Sri Ramakrishna Math, 1994). 8. Throughout I use the word 'inference' as a translation for anumana, even though the close relationship of anumana to perception (pratyaksa) might warrant 'induction' as a standard translation. 9. The Nrsimhaprakasika of Raya Narasirnha is a commentary on the Dipika, and is included in the edition of the Tarkasamgraha and DTpikd edited by Satkari Sarma Vangiya (Varanasi: Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan, 1997). 10. E.g., in the Uttara Mimamsd Sutras of Badarayana, 2.2.37-41. The Sutras (c. 5th century C.E.) as available in translation with a variety of commentaries, including those of Samkara (8th century) and Ramanuja (1 lth century). 11.

CLOONEY, S.J. 12. The Manameyodaya has been edited and translated by C. Kunhan Raja and S. S. Suryanarayana Sastri (Madras: Theosophical Publishing House, 1933). The argument is developed in numbers 36-47 in the second major part of the Manameyodaya, on the objects of right knowledge (prameya). 13. It is interesting to note that despite his rejection of the cosmological argument Narayanasudhl claims to be a theist. He concludes the section by saying that the Vedic scriptures offer sufficient and adequate evidence that there is a God, though this God is neither the maker of the world nor author of the Vedic scriptures, Narayanasudhl leaves the matter at this point; he does not go further and integrate this scriptural belief with the positions he believes to be rationally defensible. 14. This work has not been translated into English, although the first parts of it have been translated into Tamil. In the following summary, I have divided and rearranged Desika's critique of the proof in the following summary points. For a fuller version of the same points, see my "Vedanta Desika's 'Definition of the Lord' (Isvarapariccheda) and the Hindu Argument about Ultimate Reality," The Idea of Ultimate Reality in a Compar- ative Contest, edited by Robert Neville (Albany: State University of New York Press, forthcoming). 15.

Regarding the Indian traditions treated here, it will be fruitful to attempt to uncover specific sectarian roots for acts of religious reasoning which Hindu thinkers presented only in a generalized or abstract form. There are abundant materials available which will aid us in resituating the MImamsa arguments in their ritual context, and the Visistadvaita theology of Vedanta Desika in the context of devotion and temple worship. Although the Nyaya materials are more resolutely deracinated, it may be possible to discern sectarian affiliations there as well - either directly, in relation to sectarian Saiva and Yoga schools which argued the same positions regarding God's existence or indirectly, due to the fact that the logicians are in large part responding to Buddhist thinkers who had their own sectarian reasons for rejecting God's existence and therefore shaped their arguments with the aim of convincing or refuting Buddhists in particular. 21. Does God's Existence Need Proof?, p. 47. 22. I make these suggestions on cooperation from within my own Western Christian tradition; it is of course up to Indian and Hindu thinkers to decide whether or not this kind of cooperation is of interest to them.
