<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 40, No. 3 (Spring 1991) DIALOGUE Newman: The Physiognomy of Development Stephen Prickett In a lecture on patterns of recognition in art, Professor E. H. Gombrich used to show two pairs of photographs taken eighty years apart. One pair was of Emanuel Shinwell, the Labor politician; the other was of Bertrand Russell. In each case the rounded face of the baby was totally unlike that of the octogenarian in its shape, texture, and creases; yet, extraordinarily enough, what came across in each case was not dis- similarity but recognizable likeness. There was no doubt at all which chubby baby was the proletarian Shinwell and which the latest addi- tion to the aristocratic house of Russell. Recognition of both depended not so much on any particular shapes or configuration of lines as on that indefinable facial quality which we call "expression." With hind- sight we were left in no doubt that Mannie Shinwell was Shinwell even at the age of one; similarly Russell, surveying the world with, even then, a hint of aristocratic skepticism from his baby carriage, was neverthe- less unmistakably Russell. It is an example that would have delighted John Henry Newman, for it illustrates perfectly a quality which, how- ever difficult to define or describe in the abstract, increasingly came to be seen by him as a fundamental organizing human principle. Indeed, much of his writing may be seen in terms of his attempt to find a satisfactory theoretical account of a phenomenon for which his read- ing of philosophy had left him inadequately tutored and whose practi- cal importance he had discovered first in his own life. Though it pre- sents itself throughout his work in a number of guises, the word he used most often for it was "development." If on the one hand it is as elusive and intangible as a facial expres- sion, yet on the other it is also as immediately recognizable; and the fact that it was so constituted for Newman powerful evidence of its 267</page><page sequence="2">268 Stephen Prickett human importance. So much indeed that it can be seen to lie at the heart of all Newman's thinking - whether on literature, education, the- ology, or philosophy. Over and over again, at level after level, we find him returning to the question of what differentiates genuine organic life, with an internal dynamic and momentum of its own, from a mere mechanical ordering or arrangement. The "life" of a work of literature, for instance, the relation of its parts to the whole, and the development of character and action so revealed is a touchstone of his literary judg- ment. The development of the individual lies similarly at the center of his notion of what constitutes a university. In theology the idea of development - most famous, of course, in his Essay on the Develop- ment of Christian Doctrine - is in fact present throughout his thinking: it underlies his "Biglietto" speech with its critique of liberalism as much as it does his early Anglican work on the lives of the saints. Perhaps most notably of all, it is central to the concept of the "illative sense" in A Grammar of Assent, with its power of moving the human mind from partial theoretical evidence to practical certainty. For Newman the idea of development is thus much more than merely a description of the way in which the human psyche works - a practical but perhaps unfortunate limitation, as it were, on both the power of reason and the dogmatic force of revelation. Indeed, by the time we come to the Grammar, in what one might call its "illative" form, it has come to resemble much more a Kierkegaardian leap by which the co- ordinated totality of the human personality is able, through the process of what he calls "real" assent, to reach existentially toward levels of experience quite inaccessible to the "notional" propositions of reason or dogma alone. In the best tradition of Christian theology, what began as an observed phenomenon of contingent weakness ends by becom- ing the cornerstone of the whole edifice of faith. It is with this in mind that we must view what to many observers, then and later, seemed a peculiar arrogance in the labyrinthine process of Newman's conversion to Rome. After the publication of the notori- ous Tract Ninety, in February 1841, in which he demonstrated, at least to his own satisfaction, how each of the Thirty-Nine Articles could be interpreted in a manner fully consonant with Catholicism, it was obvi- ous to everyone except apparently Newman himself that his Anglican days were over. For those of his followers who still hesitated, the Bishop of Oxford's formal condemnation of the tract in his Charge of May 1842 provided final proof that the via media of the Church of England was closed to them. Almost all had joined the Roman Catholic Church before Newman broke his silence. It was not until September 1843 that he preached his last sermon as an Anglican at Littlemore, and it was more than two years later, on 9 October 1845, that he was finally re-</page><page sequence="3">Newman: The Physiognomy of Development 269 ceived as a Catholic by the providentially itinerant Domic Barberi - the extraordinary Italian priest who, in response to a vision and against the wishes of his superiors, had been drawn to England for such a time as this. Four years is a long time in anyone's life. Other Victorians were to convert to Rome and leave again within the same period. Newman's view of the Anglican and Roman Churches did not substantially alter between 1841 and 1845. What then caused the delay? The fact that during the latter part of that period, from March 1844 to September 1845, he was at work on the Essay on Development serves to account for his occupation during that time, as well his reasons for taking the final step to Rome, but that first historically based apologia for his actions could as equally well have been written after his reception as a Catholic as before. The explanation he himself later offered, and which has been accepted by most sympathetic biographers since, is that he needed time for his heart to catch up with his head. Though by 1841 he was intellectually convinced of the validity of the claims of Rome, he still felt an Anglican. Only when he could feel himself to be emotionally a Catholic - only when he could give real rather than notional assent to its claims upon him - was he prepared to act. If, as I suggest we have every reason to do, we accept this explanation for Newman's extraordi- nary delay at this crucial stage of his life, we should also accept as the corollary a much more personal interpretation than is usually given to the Essay on Development. Newman's thesis is that changes in doctrine, far from being unmis- takable evidence for heresy (as such eminent Catholic theologians of the previous century as Jacques BÃ©nigne Bossuet had argued), are, rightly understood, powerful evidence for the "organic life" of Chris- tian belief. What he calls the "idea" of Christianity is not received passively by its adherents, but "it becomes an active principle within them, leading them to an ever-new contemplation of itself, to an appli- cation of it in various directions, and a propagation of it on every side" (27). It displays the common characteristic of all living organisms: it is in a continual process of growth and change. The true test of Catholic- ity is not just which Church is most like the supposed primitive form, but also which Church has demonstrated the greatest powers of or- ganic development. Not surprisingly, most of the debate about Newman's idea of development, then and since, has centered on the obvious religious conflict from which the book arose. Thus the seven tests by which we may distinguish "genuine development" from its opposite, decay or "corruption," are rightly seen as a way of distin- guishing between the changes inherent in contemporary Catholicism and those visible in Protestantism. As Owen Chadwick has pointed out</page><page sequence="4">270 Stephen Prickett in his book From Bossuet to Newman, the argument, though impres- sive, is nevertheless finally a circular one. How are we to know which are organic changes? Those that appear in Catholicism. But there is another aspect to Newman's argument whose polemical purpose is rather less clear: an argument for complexity rather than simplicity. At first this is presented modestly enough. "The more claim an idea has to be considered living," he notes, "the more various will be its aspects; and the more social and political its nature, the more compli- cated and subtle will be its issues, and the longer and more eventful will be its course" (41). This is especially true of something as ancient and complex as Christianity. No one aspect of it can be "allowed to exclude or obscure another; . . . Christianity is dogmatical, devotional, practical all at once; it is esoteric and exoteric; it is indulgent and strict; it is light and dark; it is love and it is fear" (27). Though this is a powerful celebration of the many strands that go to make up the Catholic tradition through the ages, it is, as some of his critics noted at the time, not at first sight particularly relevant to the main thrust of his argu- ment. Indeed, in some ways it actually makes his case marginally more difficult to demonstrate, since it prevents him at the outset from iden- tifying a palpably Catholic "leading idea" or core to Christianity by reference to which the truth or corruption of all the other accretions might be judged. Newman, however, has another final test up his sleeve much more dramatic and probing than the search for "logical sequence" " or "chronic vigour" by which one might know particular doctrines or practices. We do not pick and choose our beliefs, testing them one by one for their historic continuity; we accept or reject the Catholic Church as a whole, taking its many and varied parts on trust as we do so. And how do we know the Catholic Church itself? We recognize it in pre- cisely the same way that we recognize the face of the little child in the wrinkles of the old man in the example with which we began. There can be no doubt in our minds when we encounter the true Church: There is a religious communion claiming a divine commission, and holding all other bodies around it heretical or infidel; it is a well-orga- nized well-disciplined body; it is a sort of secret society, binding to- gether its members by influences and by engagements which it is diffi- cult for strangers to ascertain. It is spread over the known world; it may be weak or insignificant locally, but it is strong on the whole from its continuity; it may be smaller than all other religious bodies together, but it is larger than each separately. It is a natural enemy to govern- ments external to itself; it is intolerant and engrossing, and tends to a new modelling of society; it breaks laws, it divides families. It is a gross superstition: it is charged with the foulest crimes; it is despised by the intellect of the day; it is frightful to the imagination of many. And Â¿here is but one communion such. (150)</page><page sequence="5">Newman: The Physiognomy of Development 271 The passage is one of the most rhetorically splendid in Newman's en- tire output, but Newman's literary rhetoric always serves an end. It is as though his attempt to focus with minute verbal precision on some- thing as indefinable yet persistent as total identity that survives the alteration of every constituent part also calls forth new powers of ver- bal expression. Thus here, anyone, pagan or Protestant, who stubs his toe against this rock knows what he has encountered. "Place this de- scription before Pliny or Julian; place it before Frederick the Second or Guizot. . . . Each knows at once, without asking a question, who is meant by it." The tactical leap from Pliny to Guizot makes the point: they see not the same organism - how could they after that passage of time? - but they recognize, as it were, the same stubborn expression on the face of the nineteen-hundred-year-old institution as was on the face of the unruly infant disrupter of the Roman Empire. It is this notion of the intangible unity of the whole that makes sense of the disparate parts and provides direction and meaning to change that is central to Newman's idea of the development of doctrine. It is also, of course, central to Newman's sense of self. As I have argued at length elsewhere, Newman, like Wordsworth, is always trying to tell us his own story. It is no accident that the Essay on Development emerges from that four-year hiatus of 1841-45 which constituted the greatest crisis of Newman's life, and that in presenting its "hypothesis to account for a difficulty" it specifically endows the Church with all the subtlety and complexity of a human psyche. Some changes to the individual are beneficial, even necessary, if they are to adjust to new circumstances; others are retrograde and even damaging to the health of the whole. Implicit in the whole argument is the unspoken question of the subtext: Is Newman the Roman Catholic more or less John Henry Newman than was the Anglican fellow of Oriel? Is there a living organic development from one to the other? It was only when he felt able to answer that question in the affirmative that he felt able to take the final step. I believe we fail to understand the full thrust of the Essay unless we see it as, in effect, the first draft of Newman's great and lifelong apologia that was in the end to include nearly all his written output. Certainly we quickly get a very clear answer to that question in insti- tutional terms once Newman had finally taken the plunge. The deli- cately ironic title of the Lectures on Certain Difficulties Felt by Anglicans in Submitting to the Catholic Church conceals what is perhaps his most devastating attack on his old communion in terms of that final test of the overall life of the organism. And it is not merely any organism. This time the anthropomorphic nature of the metaphor (if metaphor it</page><page sequence="6">272 Stephen Prickett still is) which was implicit in the Essay of five years before is now made fully explicit. Images of sap or new shoots are discarded in favor of those of mummification. What it is now clear that the Church of En- gland lacked above all is that basic condition of intelligent life: self- consciousness. As a thing without a soul, it does not contemplate itself, define its in- trinsic constitution, or ascertain its position. It has no traditions; it cannot be said to think; it does not know what it holds and what it does not; it is not even conscious of its own existence. (7) It requires no great shift of focus to read all of the above as a negative statement of Newman's own vision of what individual consciousness does entail. For Newman now the true analogy of the Church is not a grain of mustard-seed, nor yet a vine, but a sentient human being - and preferably one who had been educated at Oxford through the con- troversies of the 1820s and 30s and who had held a fellowship at Oriel. But even as Newman begins to elaborate his metaphor there occurs a typically Romantic shift of perspective. Just as Wordsworth in his Pref- ace to Lyrical Ballads had answered his own question "What is a Poem?" by defining the nature of a poet, so Newman answers his own question "What is the Church?" by shifting from anthropomorphic imagery of the institution to the mind of the individual who is doing the imagin- ing. Thus it is that students of the Fathers, antiquarians, and poets, begin by assuming that the body to which they belong is that of which they read in time past, and then proceed to decorate it with that majesty and beauty of which history tells, or which their genius creates. . . . But at length, either the force of circumstance or some unexpected accident dissipates it; and, as in fairy tales, the magic castle vanishes when the spell is broken, and nothing is seen but the wild heath, the barren rock, and the forlorn sheep-walk: so it is with us as regards the Church of England, when we look in amazement on that which we thought so unearthly, and find so common-place or worthless. (6-7) The description of the inquirers as "students of the Fathers, anti- quarians, and poets" leaves us in little doubt as to who these deluded Romantic figures are. Nor is the origin of this extended conceit in any way concealed. Those left "alone and palely loitering" by La Belle Dame Sans Merci, thinly disguised as the Church of England, are Newman and the remnants of the Oxford Movement. Anglicanism is in reality less a Church than a stage in the growth of the individual's religious imagination, offering to those not yet ready for the real thing a simulacrum whose ultimate function is to awaken a longing in the soul</page><page sequence="7">Newman: The Physiognomy of Development 273 for what it ultimately cannot satisfy - and so lead to the only Church that can meet these hitherto disappointed expectations. Keats's letters were not yet known to the general public, but it is hard to think that Newman did not have in mind here his dictum that "the Imagination may be compared to Adam's dream - he awoke and found it truth." Once again the distinction is between genuine organic life and its febrile imitations. But a new element has crept in. How are we, finally, to distinguish between the living body and the vain enchantments of simulacra? Beyond the application of rule-of-thumb tests, the final answer appears to be by means of the imagination. This is the reason for the apparent circularity of the argument of the Essay. It is only after our imaginations have intuitively grasped the whole picture that such tests will serve to convince us. Moreover, it is the imagination, the very power that first led us to seek the Church in the wrong place, that will, eventually, also leave us dissatisfied with the insubstantiality of the false forms and guide us toward the one place where truth will be found. Those who know C. S. Lewis's early autobiographical allegory The Pilgrim's Regress will recognize here a surprising similarity between the conversion experiences of two very different kinds of Oxford men. It is perhaps the less surprising when we recall that the common link is that particular English Romantic view of the imagination as the power that not merely responds to sense impressions but actively shapes our ap- prehension of the world, not just in terms of sense-data but also in our intellectual and spiritual existences. Once again, the stress lies on the wholeness of the individual person in contrast to those systems or ways of thinking that would fragment our experience and so, in the end, deny our humanity. As Newman writes in the Grammar ; "It is to the living mind that we must look for the means of using correctly principles of whatever kind" (274). And again, We are what we are, and we use, not trust our faculties. To debate about trusting in a case like this, is parallel to the confusion implied in wishing I had a choice if I would be created or no, or speculating what I should be like, if I were born of other parents We are as little able to accept or reject our mental constitution as our being We do not confront or bargain with ourselves. (47) Whether individually or ecclesiastically we must start from where we are, and we must be guided by what we are. Such a movement from the institution to the individual foreshadows the spirit behind the Apo- logia , even if the actual occasion of its writing - Charles Kingsley's pam- phlet - was unforeseeable. Yet once we have seen how strong for Newman was the strength of the analogy between the body corporate</page><page sequence="8">274 Stephen Prickett and personal, it is not hard to see how the idea of development is as much the activating principle behind Newman's spiritual autobiogra- phy as it is in the Essay on Development What Kingsley had done, in effect, with his accusation that the Catholic Church (and, by implica- tion, Newman himself) tolerated lying was to challenge the whole of Newman's personal development to date. Once again, it is a matter of the expression on the face. Was Newman the Catholic - a largely for- gotten figure in the early 1860s - more fully John Henry Newman than the Protestant of twenty years before, or was he in some sense a shrunken, warped, even a diminished figure? Was the development that had followed his journey to Rome a true unfolding of latent powers that had not found an outlet in his previous existence, or was he in some way perverted and contaminated by the principles of his new spiritual environment? Ironically, in what we have seen to be the terms set by the Essay on Development, Kingsley's challenge amounted to nothing less than a charge of "corruption," or in other words what in an institution rather than an individual would amount to "Protestantism." It is small wonder that Newman reacted so vehemently - and, rather than by rebutting the specific charges, by telling the story of his own life. Only in that way, by seeing the picture as a whole, could he put the specific points into context. "There is," wrote Newman in the Gram- mar, "no ultimate test of truth besides the testimony borne to truth by the mind itself." Man's "progress is a living growth, not a mechanism" (266). The Grammar is, indeed, the culminating work of Newman's theory of development - by which, with hindsight, we can understand better the significance of the two earlier works where, first on the macrocosmic and then on the microcosmic scale, he had attempted to explore the difference between living development and mechanism. What in the Essay on Development he had perceived primarily as a historical mode of growth, and in the Apologia had been linked with personal integrity, by 1870 he had come to see as a fundamental law of the mind's opera- tion. For Newman the human psyche was neither logical nor alogical but possessed of powers that made it rather "super-logical" - capable of reaching beyond the powers of reason and proof to conclusions that we nevertheless act upon as certainties. At first sight this looks like a form of German idealism, but in fact Newman's argument here stems directly from a bold inversion of Locke and seems to owe almost noth- ing to Kant or his repudiated followers such as Fichte or Jacobi. Whereas the Kantian "reason" applies only to a limited range of innate ideas, the whole point of Newman's account of what he calls the "illative sense" is that it applies equally to the entire range of mundane sense-experi- ence. Religious assent is not therefore a peculiar and isolated phenom-</page><page sequence="9">Newman: The Physiognomy of Development 275 enon of human experience - of "believing where we cannot prove" as Newman's contemporary, Tennyson, seems to be implying in In Me- moriam - but only the extreme end of a spectrum that begins in simple sense-perception and includes in its scope all our normal intercourse with the external world. Newman had read Hume as a teenager and had been lastingly im- pressed by his so-called "skepticism" - the demonstration of that yawn- ing gulf between probabilities so strong that we stake every aspect of our lives upon them and real "proof." It is this very Humean skepti- cism, based in turn upon logical extensions of Locke, that Newman now turns so effectively in the service of faith to produce a Copernican revolution of his own. Certainty, Newman argues, is the culmination of probabilities, independent of each other, arising out of the nature and circumstances of the particular case which is under review; probabilities too fine to avail separately, too subtle and circuitous to be convertible into syllogisms, too numerous and various for such conversion, even were they convertible. As a man's portrait differs from a sketch of him, in having, not merely a continuous outline, but all its details filled in, and shades and colours laid on and harmo- nized together, such is the multiform and intricate process of ratiocina- tion, necessary for our reaching him as a concrete fact, compared with the rude operation of syllogistic logic. (219) Newman is drawing here, as so often, on Joseph Butler, but he adds to Butler's force of probability the common Romantic assertion of the active and assimilating nature of our mental powers. So far from being the tabula rasa assumed by Locke, the human mind has the capacity to step beyond evidence and create for itself wholes that are greater than the constituent parts. It is so much an accepted characteristic of our normal behavior, moreover, that it occurs at an unconscious level in every act of sense- perception, and even when it occurs at a conscious level we scarcely notice what it is that we are doing. "Such a living organon is a personal gift," writes Newman, "and not a mere method of calculus." Thus, even in everyday affairs certitude is not so much a state of mind as "an action more subtle and more comprehensive than the mere appreciation of a syllogistic logic" (241). It "is not a passive impression made upon the mind from without by argumentative com- pulsion, but ... an active recognition of propositions as true" (262). This, the central argument of the Grammar , has always seemed to me Newman's most powerful contribution to philosophical theology. It is not the case that religious faith demands a peculiar kind of existen- tial leap but rather that it represents the most extreme, and therefore the most clearly visible, example of a process that is constantly going</page><page sequence="10">276 Stephen Prickett on in every part of our lives without our normally being aware of it. The stress now is no longer on the truth or falsehood of specific propo- sitions but on the wholeness of human experience. We do not perceive in terms of propositions; our schemata come from the life of the whole personality and, beyond that, from the no less organic life of the cul- tural, linguistic, and finally spiritual community in which we live and move and have our being. It is this organic continuity too, of course, between the culture and the individual that provides Newman with the link between the macro- cosm and the microcosm, between the idea of development in the doc- trine of the Church and the personal apologia for his own life. It was also, I suspect, one of the main reasons why he was as frequently mis- understood by his new communion as by his old. Though he was to return over and over again throughout his life to the evils of "liberal- ism," in the sense of putting the judgment of a private individual before the teachings of the Catholic Church, he was equally resolute in his insistence that to accept those teachings in the first place inescapably involved a prior act of the individual conscience - a point that was not so much anathema as simply incomprehensible to many of those on the continent, especially in Rome, who continued to feel that there was something dangerously liberal about even Newman's critique of liber- alism. Or to put it another way, to us, one hundred years later, the something indefinable in the expression on the face of the old Cardinal in those faded photographs looks remarkably like that on those paint- ings of the young Oxford don ardently embarking on the task of awak- ening the Church of England to its Catholic and apostolic develop- ment.
