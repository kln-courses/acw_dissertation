<plain_text><page sequence="1">COSTUME AND COSMOLOGY: THE ANIMAL SYMBOLISM OF THE NCWALA HILDA KUPER University of California, Los Angeles Social anthropologists have long been interested in the relationship between animal symbolism and social organisation, particularly under the rubric of totem- ism (Durkheim &amp; Mauss (I903) I963; Radcliffe-Brown I93 I; I952; Evans- Pritchard i956; Fortes I945; Levi-Strauss I963). Writers in this tradition have repeatedly stressed the relationship between specific social segments and various animal species, and have thereby emphasised the role of animal symbols in the articulation of social structure. Levi-Strauss and several other investigators have supplemented these social structural considerations with analyses of the internal logic of conceptual systems and varying assumptions about the universal structure of human thought (Evans-Pritchard I956; Leach I964; Douglas I966; Levi- Strauss I966; Fortes I967). This essay draws upon ideas central to both these interpretative styles. But while I recognise the social correlates of symbolic systems, I focus on animal symbolism in the perspective of the political system of an entire nation, rather than in relation to specific social segments. Again, while I appreciate the validity of examining symbolic systems as self-contained wholes, I am in accord with those who reject the notion that such systems are either closed or invariably built upon a series of binary oppositions. In a previous article I examined the language of space in systems of political communication (I972a), and in a subsequent article analysed styles of clothing, formal and informal, as conveying messages of different and changing identities (I973): this article extends the analysis to costume, the clothing of ritual. Once again I use material from the culture of the Swazi of south-east Africa to make points of more general interest. I must refer readers to earlier writings for a full description of Swazi kingship (Marwick I940; Kuper I947a; I963; I972b). Here it is necessary to emphasise that the Swazi had developed a complex political oral constitution, much of which persisted throughout the Colonial era, and which is being revitalised in the period since Independence. At the head of the polity is the king, titled Ngwenyama (lit. Lion), who rules with his 'mother', real or surrogate, titled Ndlovukati (lit. She Elephant). They are metaphorically described as 'twins' (emapahla); their powers however are complementary, not identical, and at times overlap (Kuper I947; esp. S4-6). Among the Swazi, animals, including birds, figure prominently in the costumes worn at the ncwala, the most important annual national ritual of kingship. Though I described the ncwala in earlier writings (I947; I97-225; I968), I did not elab- orate on, or examine, the meanings conveyed by the costume. I provide here both new ethnographic data, and interpretations of the animal symbolism of costumes</page><page sequence="2">614 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 worn on the main day of the ritual. Throughout this analysis I will indicate the way in which animal symbols express a cosmology which encompasses both the social and natural orders, and the way in which the animal world with its own system of relationships is drawn into and made a part of the social world. Though this article deals exclusively with animal symbolism, a word of caution is appropriate. As complex as it is, the animal world is but one aspect of the totality involved in Swazi cosmology; plants (leaves, branches, and fruit), the elements (water and fire, in particular); directions (left, right, north, south, etc.) and general topography (forests, mountains, rivers, and the oceans) are also important (Kuper I947; Beidelman I966 I). Beginning with a description of the ncwala costume as seen by the ethnographer, it is apparent that even a straightforward presentation must proceed in terms of (and therefore impart information about) basic Swazi conceptual categories having to do with sex, age, and political rank. Embedded in the semantic structure of the language itself, such fundamental categories may routinely remain implicit in social interaction precisely because they are universally recognised and accepted. I then present more self-conscious observations and interpretations by selected informants on the meaning of the animals used in the costumes. Finally, I attempt to extract dominant themes which order Swazi animal symbolism and which are implicit in the descriptive material. I suggest that there is a symbolic grammar-a structured set of fundamental concepts susceptible to symbolic representation- expressed through animal symbolism in Swazi costume (I973). I recognise the possibility of conflicting interpretations by individual informants, and by presenting a picture of internal consistency I do not wish to imply a homogeneous set of personalities. However, agreement about critical symbols does not necessarily imply personal homogenity; as Leach (I964) has shown, such agreement may instead imply that there exists an orderly system of ritual communication under- stood by all participants in a social system and used to express differences as well as accord. Costume of the Main Day The period covered by the term ncwala extends over 'two moons', but the major public rites are known respectively as the Little ncwala, which lasts only three days, and the Big ncwala, which lasts six days, the timing of all events being determined by the position of the sun and the size of the moon. The costume itself varies according to the events of each day, and reaches its fullest elaboration on the main day of the Big ncwala. The most conspicuous contrast between the costumes worn by the majority of participants at the climax of that day and other days is in the headgear; the Ngwenyama and Ndlovukati appear also in unique body costume. To chart the items of costume of each day would be repetitive, and since my focus is largely on the interpretation of selected animals, I have dealt mainly with the sum of items worn on the main day. It is also necessary to point out that the ncwala grows with kingship, and that until the King is fully installed, no matter how long the regency may last, the full ncwala is not performed and the costume itself is restricted (Kuper I947a: I97, 22I-3). For purposes of clothing Swazi informants divided the human body into four parts: i) enhloko (on the head); 2) emtimbeni (on the upper body); 3) elukhalweni (on</page><page sequence="3">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 6I5 the hips); and 4) etandleni (in the hands). The basic social divisions expressed in the newala costume are, on the one hand, between male and female and, on the other hand, between the various ranks in the hierarchy of royal subjects with the twin rulers at the apex of this hierarchy. The costumes worn by men are predominantly from the pelts of wild animals (tinyamatane, tilwane) killed by hunting, the costumes worn by women are conspicuously from the skin, or hide, of domesticated animals (tifuyiwe) associated with the home and sacrificed to the ancestors. Distinc- tions with the political hierarchy are more visibly marked by headgear than body- garb. The male rank order from low to high is: i) warriors; 2) princes; 3) priests; and 4) the king. The comparable but not exactly parallel female order is: i) un- married princesses; 2) married daughters of the king; 3) queens; 4) the king's mothers; and 5) queen mother. i. Males A. enhloko (on the head) i. emabutfo (warriors) a. All warriors wear feathered headgear called inyoni (the bird) con- sisting of i) ligula, a cap of the black feathers of the ostrich (intshe), and 2) sihluku or tipondvo (horns), side pieces of the long black feathers of the widow bird (lisakabula). b. Every age-set has its own distinctive headband (umchele), cut from the pelt of a particular animal. The choice of animal is guided by criteria of beauty (buhle), i.e. aesthetic appeal, and character (simo), i.e. the qualities attributed to the animal, e.g. the headband of the Balondolozi (the Guardians, the regiment of the present King) is of leopard, that of Sikhonyane (Locust regiment) of wildebeest, and of the Malindane (Waiting-for-the-Call), of otter. 2. BantfwabenKhosi (princes) a. Princes are entitled to wear the brilliant red feathers of the lourie (ligwalagwala) in the sihluku. The number of lourie feathers varies with closeness to the king; the more remote may wear only one or two, those closest (known as bantfwana belidLabe), children of the Crown, as many as they find aesthetically pleasing and within general limits of protocol. b. Princes wear the headbands of their age regiments. 3. Bemanti (priests) a. The priests who are in charge of much of the ritual wear no feathered headgear, but have a distinctive coronet (umchele) from the pelt of a baboon (inmfene or indlangala). 4. Ingwenyarna (king) a. The king's unique headgear, called lidlabe (a crown); includes 'the bird', the side pieces of which are magnificant plumes of i) the whydah (sakabula), interspersed with feathers of 2) the lourie (ligwalagwala), 3) the brown hornbill (insingizi), and 4) the eagle (lusoti).</page><page sequence="4">6I6 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 b. At the climax of the ritual when the king's entire costume is unique, his umchele is of lionskin (Kuper I947: 2I7-I8; I968: 90). B. emtimbini (on the upper body) On the upper body warriors wear tails (emashoba) of cattle made into tigedja and tingcele. In the sigedja (sing.) which is a short cloak sewn at the neck and falling lightly over the shoulders, the tails are light-coloured (mhlophe), reddish (bovu), and dark (mnyama). For the tingcele, which are tied on both forearms and at the right wrist, the tails should be light-coloured. The priests who are too busy to take part in the dancing do not wear tigedja or tingcele. The king's emashoba are again unique. His sigedja is of tails of cattle from the sacred herd known as imfukwane (I947: ISi); the singcele which he wears on his wrist is of wildebeest (ingongoni) and is longer and darker than that of the tails of cattle worn by any other man. C. Elukhalweni (on the hips) On the lower torso warriors wear a sort of kilt (lidjobo or lidada) from the pelt of the leopard (ingwe); this is beautifully bound at the top with a strip of the soft skin of a new born calf (inkonyane). The entire garment is spoken of as ingwe and is generally worn over prints (mahiya) also tied on the right side.2 There is no basic difference between the ingwe of the warriors, the priests, and the king, but everyone sees that the pelt worn by the king is exceptionally beautiful. D. Etandleni (in the hands) Warriors at the ncwala must not carry weapons of attack, but for defence and loyalty. No spears are allowed. Nearly every informant began his description with the left hand (described as sandla sokohlwa-sandla, hand; kukohlwa to forget, i.e. the forgetting hand; sandla sokuvika, the protecting hand, and sandla sencele, the wounded hand). In this hand each warrior carries a sihlangu, a large war-shield, differentiated from the lihau, the smaller shield carried by a man when travelling, courting, or 'just dancing'. Special black shields (tihlangu etimnyama), stored separately in the barracks of the ruling king's regiment at the capital, are carried at the climax of the main day by a selected group to whom the king throws a ritual gourd (luselwa). The shield, made of ox-hide, is supported by a stick (unmbogo) and kept in place by thongs (emagobelo) of different colours. On the front of the shields are decorations (tinjobo) of clusters of feathers varying with each regiment. In the right hand (sandla sokunene, the correct hand; sandla sokudla, the eating hand; sandla sokuphosa, the spear throwing hand; sandla sokulwa, the fighting hand), warriors may carry only a strong blackened stick (umzaca) cut from the tough umdoyi tree. The shield of the king is from the hide of an ox of the sacred herd, and his stick is of a tree with 'powers' (emandla). E. Emlendzeni (on the legs) and etinyawini (on the feet) There is no ncwala footwear for either men or women; and everyone should dance barefoot. Rattles worn round the ankles by women and diviners in ordinary dancing are prohibited.</page><page sequence="5">MAN, DECEMBER 1973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 617 2. Females A. enhloko (on the head) i. Unmarried princesses and girls betrothed to the king or to princes wear the red feathers of the lourie (ligwalagwala) in their hair. 2. Married daughters of the king wear their hair in the style appropriate for ordinary respectable married women. This is a high bun (sicolo), with a string across the top of the forehead and little curls on the forehead. 3. The wives of the ruling king (emakosikati wesive-queens of the nation), must also wear their hair in the bun but are distinguished from all other women participants by their headgear, termed, like that worn by the warrior, inyoni, 'the bird'. The queen's inyoni consists of two clusters of the graceful black plumes of the long tailed whydah (sakabula) on either side of the face. 4. The 'mothers of the king' (i.e. the queen mother, her co-wives and any wives of classificatory 'fathers' who may be participating) wear a coronet (umchele) of the pelt of the baboon (imfene), but no feathers. 5. The umchele of the queen mother, Ndlovukati, is worn above and in addition to her usual string of ritual wooden beads (emnatinta) with its feathers (lusiba) of the rain bird or flamingo set between two lucky beans (umsinsi). B. enitimbeni (on the upper body) i. Unmarried princesses wear decorative necklaces of which the most preferred are made from the long strands of strong, glistening, black hair of the giraffe (lihudla) adorned with occasional seashells. 2. All married women, including daughters and wives of the king, wear the goatskin apron (sidziya) tied toga-wise at the right shoulder and falling under the left arm. 3. The ten senior queens wear aprons decorated with large, ancient copper beads, a decoration used by them on all formal occasions. 4. The 'mothers of the king' wear their goatskin aprons tied under the arm- pits across the top of both bresats, a style prescribed for a woman on certain occasions of hloniph (respect, or avoidance) (Kuper 1947: 212). 5. Again the queen mother is symbolically separated and shown to be 'more powerful' than any other woman; over the sidziya she wears a full length cloak (sanokoti) of the whole skin of the leopard in which the claws have been carefully retained. C. elukhalweni (on the hips) i. Younger girls wear strings of big colourful beads (emaqanda, literally eggs), and short skirts of dark cloth (formerly leather) decorated with beads and brass studs; the whole garment is called indlamu. 2. Unmarried older girls wear two pieces of print (isidwashi), knotted tightly on both sides to form a skirt. 3. All married women as well as unmarried mothers wear an oxhide skirt (sidwaba) reaching below the knees.</page><page sequence="6">6I8 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 4. The skirt of the queen mother and the two ritual queens is cut from hides of the sacred herd and anointed with fat from these animals. D. etandleni (in the hands) Every woman carries an umcusho, a long, flexible, light-coloured branch from which the outer bark has been removed. The trees from which the umcusho is cut vary with the rank of the performer; and those for the queens and for the Ndlovukati have special power. Ordinary women may carry reeds. The umcusho is held in the right or left hand according to the dance. Informants' interpretations of animal symbolism Discussing the costume with informants it became clear that the animals and birds which were used were selected in terms of a broad system of social-psychologically oriented symbolism. The participants were explicitly identified, according to status, with different segments of the cosmos, and the rulers in particular were psycho- logically imbued with the power of animals, both wild and domestic, as well as with elements of nature. The richness of animal imagery appears in the following praises of Ngwenyama Sobhuza II: [Sobhuza II Dladla sembube simazima,] Sobhuza, paw of the heavy lion [Shoba lenkunzi limnyama liyesabeka.] Tail of the bull dark and fearful [Shaka longayembath' ingubo] Shaka who does not wear ordinary clothing [Lowembatha lugogo lwengwenyama] 'Who wears the skin of the lion [Ngingayithathaphi inkab' enkulu] Where will I find an ox as great [Engango Sobhuza.] As Sobhuza. [Mgobo wezingwe nezingonyama] Supporter of leopards and of lions [Lomanyelela3 unjengengwe yase Mdimba] Enticer like the leopard of the Mdimba (mountains) [Ndlovunduna yamaSwazi.] Male elephant of the Swazi. To try to understand the symbolism of the ncwala costume, I collected a rich body of animal lore, and commentaries on (i) specific birds and (2) other animals. There was considerable consistency in knowledge and responses; and I found that few Swazi, even in the more urban centres, were ignorant of, or disinterested in, such matters. Informants generally distinguished birds from other animals, and classified animals into wild and domesticated, carnivorous and herbivorous, those that can climb trees and those that cannot, those that live only on land, those that stay in water, and those that can live on land and in water. The most powerful of birds and other animals are used materially as well as symbolically to strengthen (cinisa) the 'King and the nation' (inkosi nesive).</page><page sequence="7">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 6I9 I give selected comments from seven informants (Ngwenyama, His Majesty King Sobhuza II, Maboya Fakudze, a senior counsillor, Ncabaniso Dlamini, a Royal, Elijah Matunywa, a commoner of no special office, Pica Magagula, a Chief, Samuel Mavuso, a commoner employed on an estate, and Sabusile Nkam- bule, an educated herbalist-farmer), aged from roughly 45 to 70 years. The numbers in brackets indicate how many of the seven made similar spontaneous observations. I. Birds mentioned as important in the headgear were: A) The lisakabuli ('widow bird' whydah, ditrotura progene) [7] B) The ligwalagwala (lourie, turacus corythaix) [7] C) Insingizi (Southern ground hornbill) [7] D) Intshe (ostrich, genus Struphio) [7] E) Lusoti (eagle) [2] 4 A. The whydah (lisakabuli) is altogether black, [7] but in the summer, the breeding season, you can see a patch of red feathers in the wings [5]. It is the male that is used [7] because it is so beautiful [7]. In summertime its tail is much more than the length of its body, [5] and then it is so heavy that the bird can scarcely fly [7] and especially in wet weather it is very easy to catch [5]. In winter it drops its tail and does not look so beautiful, [3] but you can still see that red patch on its wings [5]. The 'big', i.e., most important, thing about the whydah is that it is very proud (liyatigabatisa) [7] and is polygynous (linesitsembu) [3]. The nest is built by its women [2]. It is caught by gum (inovu) from special trees that grow in the bush- land [I]. When the bird is caught, the tail feathers are pulled out and by the following year they will have grown again [4]. B. The lourie (ligwalagwala) shows the beauty of Kingship (buhle bebukhosi) [4]. The body of this bird is blue (luhlata, the same word is often used for what observers label 'green', and it is also applied to a person who is very dark skinned), [2] and it has a long tail with a beautiful patch of red on each side by the wings [3]. An ordinary person may honour himself by wearing one red feather; only Royals may decorate with more [7]. The other big thing about the ligwalagwala is that it destroys itself, [7] like the mamba (the ancestral snake of Swazi Kings) [i]. It doesn't just die [7]. No one has seen it dead whole and naturally [3]. It probably runs to a secret place to kill itself [4]. Before it dies it cuts its feathers to pieces [7]. 'It is jealous of its feathers [2]. The feathers must be taken by killing the bird at once, [71 shooting it [2]. It flies 'lightly' and hops among the branches [i]. The feathers are more beautiful on man than on the bird itself, not like the peacock which is most beautiful when it spreads its tail [i]. Plucking the feathers, spoken of as kuguba ligwalagwala, i.e. to dig the ligwalagwala, is a very skilled job, and each feather must be specially prepared so that it bends gracefully at the tip [3]. C. The hornbill (insingizi) has black, grey and white feathers, but it is particularly the white feathers which are used [4]. 'I first thought it was all black, then when it flew, I saw the white on the wings [i].' The power to fly is in the white feathers [3]. It is very difficult to catch and quick to see any snare [4]. It is generally acknow- ledged to have a special destructive power (Tintsingizi tiyaphahlana) [6]. If you kill one, its mate or another of its kind cries and sends a sickness, perhaps even death</page><page sequence="8">620 MAN, DECEMBER 1973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 [4]. Therefore, you must quickly be treated with intseleti (special protective medi- cines) to rid you of its liphahlo (destructive mystical power) [4]. This bird shows 'lihlobo lebukhosi' (the summer of kingship) [i]. D. The ostrich (intshe) especially the male, [5] has beautiful plumage [7]. The feathers give dignity; literally, the 'feathers are heavy' (tinsiba timatima) [3]. If you have white feathers, which grow at the end of the tail and the wings, you can decorate (hloba) yourself with these as well, [2] but the cap (ligula) must be mnyama -dark, [7] neinandla (with power) [2]. It is a strange bird [5]; with all those feathers it cannot really fly [7] but runs very quickly, ntje ntje [2]. E. A bird closely and uniquely associated with the King is the eagle, of which there are several local varieties.5 In a number of folktales, the eagle is spoken of as 'the King of the birds' and to it are attributed strength and far-sightedness, enabling it to swoop down and carry away chickens and lambs. Feathers of eagles may only be worn in the headdress of important chiefs, and of course by the king, and one species (lusoti, which is relatively rare and found around Mpaka in southwest Swaziland) is an essential ingredient in the medicines used to sanctify the King. Kuhlatjwa lusoti (to be stabbled by the lusoti) is an idiom used to describe the shivers -a sign offear and/or fever. Parts of lusoti are ground with parts of a lion and mixed with luselwa (the wild green gourd that grows on a creeper that spreads widely and produces many fruit.6 Bird metaphors resound in royal praises. Sobhuza II is praised as ingculungculu, another species of eagle (the words of praises are chosen for their sound as well as imagery); and inkhweletsheni, a bird that is said never to stop on the ground, but only on stone or rock (etshenii). Rock symbolises that which is most enduring. A common theme in fables and myths is the transformation of a human into a bird; and in discussing birds the emphasis is often on beauty (buhle) (beauty itself exer- cising power), as well as other specific powers (emandla) including fertility. Every child is also 'smoked' in the special ingredients of its clan that include associated birds and/or other animals. 2. Wild animals associated with costume include the A) baboon, B) wildebeest, C) otter (used in headgear), as well as D) the lion, and E) leopard. A. From the long-haired baboon, specialists cut the decorative coronets worn by the queen-mother and her co-wives, and the distinctive headgear of the priests, Bemanti (Kuper I947: 2I7). The baboon is very like a person and unlike a monkey (ingobiane) [2] it cannot be eaten [5]; it has a power of long life [7], and no one has ever seen it die [4]. Though it can walk on the ground like a human, it has a wonderful tail [5] which helps it swing from branch to branch and never fall [2]. Its food habits appear to be between carnivore and herbivore. It eats leaves, fruits, and crops, also insects and smaller animals [5] and is believed to kleza (suck the milk from cows) [i]. B. Wildebeest and otter have also been attributed with special power. Briefly, the outstanding quality of the wildebeest is the sensitive reaction of the tail [6] which 'shows' if any danger is approaching [7] and this may explain why it is used as a switch by diviners in their seances. C. The otter is a most remarkable animal7-it lives in water and eats things that live in water and it also goes on land and eats things on land [7] like chickens [3]. It has smooth hair like land animals, and not scales [4] like the skin of a fish [3].</page><page sequence="9">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 62I Though it is so small, it is exceptionally strong [6] (several examples were given to illustrate its physical strength). It is very difficult to find, [5] it usually comes out at night, and certain men have special potions to catch it [4]. A person who kills it must be protected because it is contaminating (iyapahlana), [4] and if it bites some- one that person will go mad (uyahlanya) unless specifically doctored [3]. 3. The wild animals given special recognition in the ncwala body costume are the lion, the elephant and the leopard. The lion and the elephant appear together in Swazi cosmology as the most powerful and dominant in both the untamed world of nature, and the world of men. The rulers of human society seem to be identified with these animals at a more than verbally metaphorical level.8 Animals are used by people in most cultures as symbols in their system of communication, and the lion in particular has a central place not only in African mythology. At the same time even the question of what is and is not an animal receives different and often contradictory answers, depending on people's perception of their total universe (Kuper I970). All seven special informants stressed the lion's bravery, strength, and cleverness, supporting each of these characteristics with graphic examples. In addition to these generally known qualities, it was described as 'generous' and 'aware of others' needs [5]'. It is a great meat-eater but only kills for food, [6] and having gorged itself it does not hide the remains [4] (like the leopard) [3]. There is a well known story (reminiscent of Androcles and the Lion) validated in the praises of the Msibi clan recounting how a Lion who had a thorn in its foot appealed to an Msibi hunter for help, and then in gratitude killed a buck and left it in the path for his human friend [2]. The Lion and the Elephant are seen as complementing each other and not as being in competition. The Ngwenyama as king of men has the qualities of the Lion, king of animals, and the Ndlovukati, as his mother, the qualities of the great she Elephant. The elephant is the largest of all animals [7], it is also the strongest [5]- but no one has ever seen a lion and an elephant fight [2]: Lion and elephant are both wonderful, [5] with powers [7]; moreover though they are both strong and fear- less, [5] they do not attack without reason [7]. They help each other [3]; the lion eats only meat (carnivorous) and the elephant lives on leaves and shoots of trees (herbivorous) [7]. When elephants charge they knock everything down and stamp it into the ground, [3] but they never eat any other animals [7]. The green branches of the lusekwane shrub used to encircle the King's sanctuary was a favourite food of elephants [2]; a lioness hides its cubs behind bushes and the Ngwenyama is treated in the inhlambelo surrounded by the lusekwane [2]. The lion and the ele- phant are joined together in ruling (embusweni) by their strength and by their differences [3]. Lions go to the water to drink; elephants can swim across rivers [6] and go into the water to wash themselves, [2] elephants and water 'feel for each other [i]'. The Ingwenyama and Indlovukati are twins (emapahla), [2] the crest for the independent kingdom of Swaziland must have both the Lion and the Elephant, one on either side of a shield [2]. Sex differences within and between animal species appear to provide a funda- mental paradigm for human behaviour and at one level the lion epitomises mascu- linity and the she-elephant female qualities. Within the same species the emphasis is on the proprietary rights of the male; and the aggression he shows when these are</page><page sequence="10">622 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 threatened by other males, while it is 'the nature' of the female to be most ferocious when its young are threatened. There is also recognition of mutuality-for example, the different roles of lions and lionesses in organising a kill, guarding the lair, or leading a charge. Between the lioness and she-elephant informants made another illuminating contrast-the indlovukati (she-elephant) has a long gestation (two years) [5] and then bears only one baby; [7] the lioness, for whom there appears to be no single word but who is described as 'the female' (insikati) bears more frequently [5] and has several cubs at a time [7]. In the lion troop, the male is dominant, but in the herd of elephants we are told the old females lead [2]. The general attitude towards these two key animals was neatly summed up by Maboya Fakudze, 'According to my thinking, you could not have a lion and a lioness rule together, or an elephant and a she-elephant; it is necessary that they are different (bayahlukena) but equal (balingana), and umbuso (rule, government) is best shown through a lion going together with the she-elephant.' The elephant is conspicuous in the ncwala costume when, at dawn of the main day, the King walks naked before the women and warriors with only a glowing white penis covering made from the tusk of an elephant. Sabusile Nkambule commented, 'In the incwala, Ngwenyama on the main day wears a headdress of lionskin, and sits on lionskin; but when he walks before his people he wears an ivory penis sheath, and is praised as ' Wena Wendlovu' (You of the Elephant) and Ndlovu yakaNgwane (Elephant of the Ngwane-i.e., Swazi). At the climax of the ncwala when the King emerges as Silo-an awesome non- specific creature, he wears a cap of black plumes that cover his face, and underneath the feathers is the lionskin head-band. E. More conspicuous than lion or elephant in the actual costume is (ingwe) the leopard, which is described as having a 'power of its own', and to be exceedingly quick in its movement, [4] difficult to kill, [4] and dangerous even when not provoked [7]. Before the introduction of guns, only a very brave man would tackle it, and he would try to strike it with a sigila (knobbed stick) at a vulnerable spot on the head rather than risk throwing a spear [2]. It eats what it kills-and it even kills baboons and rats; [3] unlike the lion it hides what it cannot eat [3]. It climbs trees and watches all that happens [3] and often it attacks at night. Every informant also stated that it has a singularly beautiful pelt, [7] and there is a well known idiom-Ingwe idle ngemabala (the leopard eats by its colours-i.e., it attracts others by its beauty and then is able to destroy them) [71. The power to destroy is in its claws [3]. 3. The main domestic animals in Swazi culture are cattle and goats. The im- portance of cattle has been stressed in earlier writings (Marwick I940; Kuper I947; I963), and the general attitude towards cattle in various African societies from the Horn to the Cape has been so frequently and eloquently described that there is little need for elaboration. But it is necessary to point out that cattle provide some of the material essential for the costumes of ncwala, and that the skirts of the Indlovukati and of the two ritual queens were cut from skins of animals of a sacred royal herd, the mfukwane, attributed with unusual qualities of strength and loyalty. The fat of mfukwane animals was also used to anoint the rulers (I947: 15I, 2I8). There is also an interesting issue concerning the meaning attributed by Swazi to two particular animals-the ncwanmbo and umddvutshnlwa-which are called 'bulls'</page><page sequence="11">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 623 but which are in fact oxen. The king sits on the ncwambo (the word for testicles) when he is washed with medicines that include umtfuso (derived from kutfusa meaning to stir or awaken), a prescription given to bulls to make them strong and quick to climb cows and given to men to stir virility (Kuper I947: 214). The ncwambo is never killed and when it loses its vigour a young substitute is found. On the other hand, the umdvutshulwa (from kudvubula, to pummel or thump) is beaten with the hands of the 'pure' youths before it is sacrificed in a sequence of events I have described in a previous account of the ritual (Kuper I947: 2I2). Though the two animals are not directly part of the ncwala costume they are brought into inti- mate physical contact with the body of selected participants, more especially the King. The analytical problem posed by these animals relates to their characterisation as bulls: why should the ncwambo and the umdvutshulwa which are in fact oxen be described as 'bulls'? Beidelman wrote perceptively that through castration, 'the beast becomes a kind of transcendent bull, that is, it continues to be termed "bull" in the sense that it epitomises certain masculine and powerful attributes . . . it is in Turner's phrase "betwixt and between"' (I966: 385). Discussing this problem with Swazi informants I received the following pragmatic explanation: 'Cast- rating a bull makes it tame. The king at the ncwala must not have lulakha [tyranny, wildness, or "cheek"]. He must be restrained through the people. The ncwala is a thing of kingship but the king is king by his people. He is not alone in govern- ment. He must use the inikabi (ox) for the ncwala but it is called " bull" just as he is praised as Our Bull because he must have the power (emandla) of a bull.' In other words, the king is controlled by the people while his potency is recognised as essential for their well-being. The ox which is called a bull expresses ritually the proper social order in which the king-the individual who by birth has greater potential for good and evil than any other man-is restrained by social means from tyrannic and arbitrary acts. It is therefore logical and rational that the king be both an ox (tamed and strong) and a bull (powerful, fierce, and fertile); the ox-bull is an accurate symbol and puzzling only if regarded concretely, literally, and in isolation from the kind of king desired by the people. At this point it is interesting to refer to another animal-the buffalo (inyatsi) which is particularly relevant to the analysis of symbolism, though not used directly in the costume itself On the evening of the Great Day the warriors return from bathing in the river, and go to praise their King who is enthroned in the sibaya on the skull (lukakhayi) of a buffalo placed on an inkhatsa (a large circle woven of special grasses).9 His elaborate costume has been removed; and he is 'fearsome' (awe-inspiring) with 'dark' (potent) potions painted on his face and nude body. The skull of an animal and of man is considered very important to behaviour, or character (simo). It protects bucopho (the brains, described by my informants as the 'place' or 'seat' of 'knowing', 'feeling ' and 'thinking'). In animals, it includes the essential link ('join') between the horns. The horns are what the animal uses to protect itself [3]. You can tell your own animal by its horns [4] and that is what you often notice first [i]. The praise song of Mswati, greatest of the Swazi fighting Kings, contains the following stanza: When the King sits on the skull of the buffalo the coward will run away. (Mswati himself was praised as 'Buffalo with rugged horns'.)</page><page sequence="12">624 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 The buffalo appears to be in-between wild and domesticated animals. It is described as like an inkhonto (any head of cattle)-but also different [7]. Its skin smooth [4] and it bellows like an inkhomo, [S] but it is bigger, [7] heavier [4] and stronger [4] and has more prominent horns [7]. The power of the buffalo is in the horns [5] with which it can defend itself [5] even against lions [i]. If wounded, it a) isolates itself like the Ngwenyama on the day of the ritual, known as kutila (taboo), when the King sits alone (Kuper I947) 'in a gloomy, miserable way', regaining his strength [i]; b) it sometimes shams death [4]; and though it goes with others (in a herd) 'it is said to be able to survive on its own' [i]. The day of taboo is essentially a liminal period at the end of the major rites before the King and nation resume their more normal routine. It is therefore appropriate that the animal on which the King sits at that juncture is in the category of 'betwixt and between' (Turner I966) or is one that 'crosses the boundaries' (Douglas I957)- The symbolic significance of selected domesticated animals in the ncwala costume as well as ordinary clothing'0 is further evidenced in Swazi exegesis on the goat. Surprisingly little attention has been paid by writers on southern Africa to this strange animal which figures so prominently in classical mythology. Long- haired goats are kept in large numbers in different parts of Swaziland and are as essential as cattle in many situations, but are not regarded as substitutes for cattle, and it is erroneous to describe them as 'poor man's cattle'. A goatskin apron is as essential as the oxhide skirt for a properly married woman, and is also described as her 'most beautiful' (decorative) garment. Apart from, or rather in addition to, the aesthetic aspect, goats are said to be very fertile and hardy and also more pro- ductive than cattle-'A goat never misses '. The Swazi appreciation of these qualities is as it were the cultural converse of the European idiom of the 'lecherous goat'. So, goats are used symbolically (expressively and instrumentally) in many rituals- thus when a woman does not conceive or has miscarriages, the inyanga (specialist) requires a goat for her treatment and when a baby is born, a goat is sacrificed and the skin is used for the sling (imbeleko) in which it is carried on the back-' No one in the past would have thought of using the skin of any other animal, except in the case of the King who as an infant was carried in a sling cut from the pelt of the silver monkey' (an animal attributed with long life). It is not surprising to find the goatskin apron an integral part of the ncwala costume prescribed by tradition for every married woman (Kuper 1973)." Themes, correlations, interpretations In every society man relates to other men, to animals and to nature. The defini- tion of these categories creates an anthropomorphic view of the world as cosmos, a cosmos which changes over time within a single society and varies between societies with cultural classification expressed in language and behaviour. In this section J attempt to outline the structure of the Swazi cosmos as revealed through animals selected for the ncwala costume. Four recurrent concerns emerged from informants' descriptions of the character- istics of the wild animals used in the costumes. These animals are frequently charac- terised as either beautiful, vital (having life-giving or life-sustaining powers, destructive, or as crossing or standing between major categories of animals.</page><page sequence="13">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 625 As to beauty, the whydah, lourie, ostrich and leopard are mentioned directly, with more implicit statements being made about several others. The male whydah is used 'because it is so beautiful'. The lourie shows the 'beauty of kingship' having a 'beautiful patch of red on each side of the wings'. But the feathers are 'more beautiful on man than on the bird itself'. The ostrich is said to have 'beauti- ful plumage' which gives dignity. The leopard 'attracts others by its beauty and then is able to destroy them ' I2 The animals mentioned in connexion with long life, fertility, or defiance of death include the lourie, the hornbill, the silver monkey, the leopard and possibly the buffalo. The lourie does not die a natural death but 'runs to a secret place to kill itself'. The hornbill is 'difficult to catch and quick to see any snare'. The silver monkey has the 'power of long life; no one has ever seen it die'. The leopard is 'difficult to kill'. The buffalo is 'able to survive by itself' and 'shams death'. Animals having destructive power are the hornbill, the otter, the leopard, and the buffalo. The hornbill has a 'special destructive power'. If its mate is killed, it 'sends a sickness, perhaps even death'. The otter can cause madness if it bites some- one who has not been specifically doctored. The leopard is 'dangerous even when not provoked' and 'often it attacks at night'. The buffalo can defend itself even against lions with its prominent horns. It is also clear that the same animals may represent more than one quality: this is a characteristic of course of many symbols (Turner I967). Animals which seem to cross categories include the whydah, lourie, ostrich, baboon, otter, and buffalo. The whydah is a bird and yet it 'can scarcely fly', while the ostrich cannot fly at all even though it has many great feathers. The lourie flies 'lightly' hopping among the branches. The baboon can walk on the ground like a human but can also swing in the trees without falling. It is both a carnivore and herbivore. The otter lives in water but has hair like land animals. It eats both aquatic and terrestrial animals. Although it is small, it is very strong. The buffalo is like a cow but is also different in being more powerful and having larger horns. It is a cross between the wild and the domesticated. The two main sets of social contrasts made by the ncwala costume are i) between male and female and 2) the special status of the king and queen mother relative to the rest of the nation. The division between male and female is marked in the ncwala costume as well as in the usual traditional clothing. The everyday dress of Swazi men emphasises wild animals while Swazi women dress primarily in the skins of domestic animals. However, in the ncwala there is a prescribed combination of wild and domestic animals for both sexes, though the sexes are distinguished as to the combinations. The men combine the leopard skin with the tails of cattle and the soft skins of young calves and wear feathered headgear. Except for the queen mother who wears a leopard cloak on the Main Day, the royal women wear only hides of domesticated animals (cattle and goats) and feathers of untamed birds. In the ritual diverse ingredients are mixed to increase potency and renew the strength of the rulers representing the nation. Animals which offer direct analogies with aspects of the kingship include the why- dah (which is very proud and polygynousI3 and has its nest built by its women), the lourie (which shows the beauty of kingship), the hornbill (which shows the</page><page sequence="14">626 MAN, DECEMBER 1973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 summer of kingship), the eagle (which is the king of the birds, having strength and farsightedness and being the most powerful of birds), the buffalo (which isolates itself like the king during the day of taboo to regain its strength). The lion and elephant in particular personify the traits of ideal rulers. They are both fearless and the most powerful and rational of their kind. They do not attack without reason. The lion is clever and generous, aware of others' needs, and carnivorous. The elephant is herbivorous, dedicated to protecting its young, has only one baby at a time, and an older female leads the herd. The two are perceived as equal in powers, and complementary. The symbolic separation of the king is indicated by his exclusive wearing of eagle feathers, the lion pelt 'crown' and other unique regalia. Perhaps the self- destruction of the lourie is applied to royals who alone display these brilliant feathers-the hubris of high position. * * * * * In a previous paper on Swazi clothing (I973) I stressed the way in which differ- ences in clothing were used to reflect and sustain social differentiation according to social class, sex, age, occupation, political rank, and ethnic affiiation. The present analysis of Swazi costume provides additional evidence to support this point. But differentiation is not the only theme running throughout Swazi ncwala costume. Every clan in Swaziland has certain identifying rituals requiring as a rule particular animals,1 4but the animals used in the ncwala are more numerous than for rituals of any of the specific clans which together constitute the nation, represented by the dual monarchy. Moreover, the nation is not a closed system, and in the process of time new clans have been, and are still being, incorporated, and existing clans may sub-divide, but the core of symbolism remains (Kuper I972b). As far as the ncwala costume is concerned, the king and his mother, as vessels of kingship, stand for and mystically combine in their persons the entire Swazi nation. The ritualised treatment of their bodies helps give their position tangible form. Parti- cularly revealing are animals such as the otter, the buffalo and the ox-bull which mix features of, or stand between, major categories, and thereby appear to the analyst to mediate between, or transcend routine cosmological (domestic versus wild animals) and social (male versus female roles) distinctions. The symbols that serve unequivocally to set the king's costume apart also serve, from another point of view, not as a denial but as a summation of all other male costumes. To this end the animals specifically brought in contact with the king and queen mother are the same kind of animals used in the costumes of other people, but they are the best (in terms of power) of their kind. The all-embracing, summarising nature of the king's costume is evident even when its uniqueness does not rest on readily apparent differences with other costumes. The king's body garb is distinctive, but not necessarily because it contains new species of animals. Thus, his sigedja is of tails of sacred cattle, and his ingwe (grossly similar to that of the normal warrior) is made of a leopard skin of exceptional beauty. The Swazi use of and attitude towards the various birds and animals is therefore not 'totemism' in the sense of social divisions identified through and with natural</page><page sequence="15">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 627 species. The various ritually important species divide into conceptual, not neces- sarily social, categories; and individual animal species concretise intangibles by representing a range of cosmic powers. This feature of Swazi thought structures, in turn, the way in which kingship achieves identification with the nation. In serving as the symbol of the nation the king does not mechanically combine in his costume species of animals narrowly identified with specific social groups. The king does not, for example, wear all the distinctive headbands or a headband made of all the pelts particular to the different age regiments. Instead, at the climax of the main day of the ncwala, he wears a headband made of a pelt of the single animal that stands superior, by definition, to those used in the headbands of all the warrior regiments. The king's costume may be a melange, but it is not a melange constructed by simple addition. The king must be identified with the many and at times conflicting forces in the cosmos, hence the diversity of his costume. But his identity with these forces is asserted by associating him primarily with those animal species which embody these forces in all their vitality and purity. This is congruous at the structural level with the right of the king to break the rules of incest that constrain ordinary men, and take as queens not only women from all clans in the nation, but also from his own. This is referred to specifically in one of the main ncwala songs, with the theme 'He sleeps with his sister' (Kuper I947: 203). It is possible that there may be an analogy between systems analysed by Levi-Strauss (I966), Douglas (I966), and others, of animals used in costume and in rules of marriage and of animals used as food and in marriage. In his capacity as mediator between Swazi society and the cosmos, the king emerges at the climax of the ncwala ritual as silo, a primordial, greater than human creature, who patently transcends the boundary between the human and non- human, the social and natural. The king transcends contradictions and discon- tinuities of Swazi society by defying mundane reality, and is identified by his subjects with the power of cosmic forces. A full defence of this latter assertion would require an examination of the total symbolism of kingship, and of all the ingredients used in building up this position. Even though such considerations lie outside the scope of the present study, the validity of this interpretation is implicit in the data. Swazi are explicit that major actions by men are influenced by move- ments of sun and moon; natural phenomena are part of human destiny. If the 'right' day for the public participation in the great ritual is missed, and the sun passes the southernmost point before the King starts on his mythical journey into a future ordered by the past, a special domesticated animal-an ox without horns- must be used to separate the confusion, and reintroduce the correct order (Kuper I947: 20I-2). As a ritual of national rejuvenation and new life, the ncwala puts the Swazi nation in touch with emandla, 'powers '-the diverse forces which are believed to sustain kingship. The theme or motif which dominates the animal symbolism of the ritual is a concern with 'powers'. The word emandla has no singular; it is a plural, inclusive, multiple concept. In Swazi thought those powers are conceived of as all- pervasive which, on the one hand, are almost impossible to contain or delimit, and on the other, are drawn upon by man and directed to his purposes. The very properties of the concept mitigate against its having a consistent or neatly worked out symbolic manifestation. These complexities are further cut across by the am-</page><page sequence="16">628 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 bivalence with which Swazi (like other people) appear to regard powers. Women are believed to have destructive powers when they are menstruating, precisely at the time when they evidence their beneficial potential procreative powers most clearly, Similarly, the king is benefactor of the nation, but he is also potentially the greatest evildoer. Much of the apparent formlessness and lack of rigidity within the symbolic system derives from the properties of this central concept of 'powers'; its many facets and aspects do not dovetail into a single, tidy system. The animal symbolism of the ncwala does not constitute a completely closed system in which there are no logical or symbolic loose-ends. Equally, the fluidity and ambiguity inherent in the structure of the cosmology itself cannot be compressed into a dualistic framework. If Swazi cosmology is to be given any credence, two by two is not the only way to link parts of a system. The concepts expressed through animal symbols are based on a world view of many dimensions and different levels. Like a prism which breaks up light and yet does not keep the colours separate, so the classificatory system of the Swazi is not a system of duality but of many interacting components. The system does not lack order. 'Powers' is the dominant concept around which Swazi cosmology and society is built and around which the particulars of animal symbolism are arranged. The symbolism of 'powers' is not closed to change; details may be dropped, added, or altered. The dominant symbols and ideas which order the system are rooted in the structure of the monarchy, and changes in even peripheral details are made in the light of this 'political cosmology'. Informants may disagree on details and the details themselves may change with time, but the total system remains coherent and internally consistent as long as it is validated by the tradition of kingship. Tradition itself is a complex concept. Viewed from the outside it spells conservatism, but from within, tradition is an active resource of 'powers'. The ncwala itself has changed over time (K-uper 1972b) but as a ritual of kingship has continually been legitimated by tradition (in the Weberian sense). The messages relayed through the animals used in the costumes replicate to some extent the hierarchical social relationships within the Swazi monarchical tradition. While I do not assert that there is a perfect 'fit' between different animal and social categories, the meanings attributed to each animal depend on a universe seen as shared by man. The dominant animal symbols of the ncwala are repeated in other social situations, and though I have not attempted to do so, it is possible that an analysis of the costume could be artfully reduced to a paradigm of structural con- vergence parallel to that so skilfully narrated by Mary Douglas in her analysis of food (I972). That there should be some correlation is of course not surprising; after all struc- tured relations are expressed in the medium of culture, and selection of and abstention from cultural elements (such as animals, or food, or clothing) are inte- grated into a symbolic system of which the social hierarchy may serve as a primary referent. But the correlation is not simple, and changes occur over time: the social referent is neither monolithic nor static, and values, albeit embodied in material substances, are complex and not inherently consistent. Costume provides a visual demonstration of simultaneous and contrasted effective ideas, more generally perceived to be present in mythology and cos- mology which have comparable but not identical counterparts in the world of man</page><page sequence="17">MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 629 and man's world of animals. Cosmologies, like all ideologies, are formulated by men only partly in their own social image, round key social groups and persons. The Swazi monarchy provides one ideological form of coherent organisation in a particular universe of experience, and is dressed in costume appropriate to that particular time and place. NOTES I wish to thank the National Science Foundation for a grant (I966-68), the Guggenheim Foundation for a fellowship (I969-70), and the Social Science Research Council for a travel grant (I969-70). I also acknowledge the assistance of Theresa Thoko Ginindza, Roy Behnke, and David Kuby in the writing of this article, and Mary Douglas, Phyllis Kaberry, Kirsten Sommerfelt and Leo Kuper for their helpful comments. I Beidelman presented a stimulating symbolic and psychological interpretation of the cosmological dimensions of the ritual. He directly criticised Gluckman's interpretation of the ritual used to illustrate his general thesis of 'ritual of rebellion' (I954). In a forthcoming article I discuss both these interpretations. 2 In a major rite on the previous day, 'pure' youths chosen to catch and throw a fierce bull required in a sacramental meal, must wear only the ingwe, and have nothing on the upper body (Kuper I947a). 3 Quotation from Ginindza, Theresa Thoko I968, Sibongo. Dissertation submitted in part requirement for the B.A. Degree, University Botswana, Lesoto and Swaziland, p. 4I. The word 'enticer' is the closest we could get to the Swazi word lomanyelela, from kunyelela-to attack and to withdraw. 4 All these birds are wild. Chickens are domesticated and a few families now keep ducks and geese. Peacocks were given to the king and parade at some of the royal villages. Their feathers are much admired, but are not worn for ritual. 5 Only two of the seven informants (the Ngwenyama and Maboya Fakudze) mentioned the lusoti spontaneously; however, I asked others for their comments, and present the main qualities which were emphasised. 6 Praises of Sobhuza II, by Mabuntalne Mdluli, include the words: [Ndvodza yembenge ngule dlaluselwa yakangwane] Man of the great container that eats the gourd of Swaziland [Lona lwenaba kitsi ka Lobamba] That which spreads at our home of Lobamba [Lwabe luyasicedza sigodlo] That encircled the harem [Wabonakala kutsi uyinkhonyane] It made clear that you are a calf [Ledla luselwa] That eats the wild gourd. 7 Cf. discussion of the otter in Tambiah I969: 433. 8 On the Day of Independence, September 6, I968, the King, having received the official documents from the British, stood alone on the dais in the stadium, and each contingent of participants, police, veterans, scouts, etc., marched past in their uniforms, turning towards him to give him a royal salute, but when the Swazi regiment in the ncwala costume came past, they raised their shields and averted their faces. Maboya Fakudze commented that this showed Inkosi Ingwenyama-literally the 'King is the Lion' and he likened it to the hunter's mode of protection against attack from the Lion, 'greatest ofall animals' in the period when hunters were armed only with spears and shield. The warriors' gesture was interpreted by him as their recognition of the unique and overwhelming power of the male ruler who could not and should not, be 'stared at', or 'looked in the eye'. Several other informants, in different contexts, made the statement 'It is dangerous to look at the Lion'. It is difficult to understand what exactly is meant when Swazi speak of, and address, the rulers by selected animal names. But it does seem to me that the names conjure up emotionally significant images and that by calling a person by the name of these special animals is more than simple metaphor, and may convey relationships of different levels of meaning. 9 Por reasons that are not relevant to this article, I omitted a description of this rite from my previous descriptions of the ncwala.</page><page sequence="18">630 MAN, DECEMBER I973, VOL. 8, NO. 4 10 I, too, omitted to discuss this animal specifically with my seven selected informants and have had to extract comments from my general notes, and discussions with Swazi in London. II Cattle, goats and sheep are the main domesticated animals, but sheep are never used by Swazi as clothing. Sheep hold a very special place in the culture; they must not be eaten by any member of the Dlamini (royal) clan, and are associated with the death ritual of Kings. A senior prince commented that the use of sheepskin clothing 'would be as horrible as putting the King in contact with a corpse'. In This does not mean that some other animals are not considered equally beautiful. Thus the zebra which is greatly admired is not used in the ncwala; however only the King may sit on a zebra skin. 13 It is interesting that Afrikaners talk of the whydah as 'die Kafir koning'-the 'black' king. 14 The Nguni do not practise any 'totemic ritual' as generally understood, but every clan has its own secret potions made from animals attributed with special powers. Soon after birth each child should be bunyiselwa (smoked) in potions that include parts of animals to give it both identity with its clan, and protection against dangers from outsiders.
