<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLERIDGE AND THE WHEELS OF INTELLECT BY MARGARET L. WILEY living Words. The Wheels of the Intellect, I admit them to be; but such as Ezekiel beheld in "the visions of God" . . . "The Author's Preface," Aids to Reflection THE STUDENT of Coleridge's thought is likely to turn with a sense of relief from the apparent confusion of his metaphysical and epistemological speculations to the relative calm of his semantics. Here, at least, one can operate within a well-defined area, presenting in an or- derly fashion Coleridge's great respect for words, his insistence that they be used carefully, his concern with paradox and contradiction, his fa- mous distinctions such as that between reason and understanding, and the background of such coinages as esemplastic. This area provides the clue to Coleridge's whole system and is full of implications which stretch far out beyond the realm of words. Coleridge's thinking follows closely the pattern of scepticism trace- able in many seventeenth-century men whom he admired, such men as Donne, Browne, Baxter, Milton, and Taylor. But he went further than his predecessors or rather made explicit much of what was only implied in their writing. While they insisted, for example, after the near-despair of nescience, that satisfactory knowledge could come only by way of action, that one must do in order to know, Coleridge went on to explore the nature of that knowledge and to confront the further problem of how it could be reduced to or suggested by words, without losing its distinctive character in the process. The task he set himself was to dis- cover how, following an action in which he had come very close to the truth of things, he could mark the area of his experience for future refer- ence and how he could awaken in others by means of words an apprecia- tion of the import of such action. He was trying to do for philosophy what Wordsworth had done for poetry by describing "spots of time" so vividly that the reader must either enter into his experience vicariously or recall similar experiences of his own and draw conclusions from them. To Coleridge, words occupy an important intermediary position be- tween the static intellectual arrogance which takes the part for the whole and the dynamic humility of significant action, out of whose irreducible complexity truth is somehow born. The two extremes represent, respec- tively, the point at which the understanding operates upon sensuous materials and considers it has solved the problem of knowing and the point at which experimentative and scarcely definable action wrests a very different certainty from the nature of things. If there were some way of communicating directly this latter kind of experience, with its 101</page><page sequence="2">Coleridge and the Wheels of Intellect weight of truth, words might become anachronistic; but this side of the millennium they seem to be a necessity. Bounded by the two extremes we have noted lies the kingdom of words, an ambivalent kingdom, notably in danger at the close of the eighteenth century of allying itself completely with things, priding itself upon its finality, and forgetting its mediating function, that of embodying the truths wrested from living so that they are communicable without be- coming petrified. The continuous tension created by the dangers of set- tling back into petrification or of overshooting the mark and dissolving into the thin air of truth tends to make this realm of words a microcosm of the whole process of knowing. The users of words must never relax in the false assumption that any combination of words has finally fixed and encompassed an idea, nor must they abandon the quest for closer and closer verbal approximations of ideas, whose only complete incarna- tion is in action. The opposition here is the old Goethean one between "In the beginning was the Word" and "In the beginning was the Deed." Not only the romanticist, but every thinking individual is in danger of mistranslating Logos and so of falsifying its meaning. In the name of all that is human, Coleridge cannot abandon words and wing his way toward a realm where they are superfluous, but he must guard carefully on this earth against their hubris, which may easily infect the men who use them. Once words are considered self-sufficient, the door is closed to truth, and intellectual revolution is indicated as the only remedy whereby a free access to truth may be reestablished. The history of scepticism con- sists in tracing the spans between such recurrent revolutions. Thus Coleridge is trying to build into his intellectual system, which closely resembles that of the sceptics, a safety device which will make such dras- tic measures unnecessary by serving as a continuous reminder of the conditions which precipitate them. The semantic theories which we should like to consider here constitute such a safety device. If Coleridge warns against considering words as terminal, he also re- stores to them (in true sceptic fashion) a new kind of dignity, which derives from their unique role in the process of knowing. One of the rare coincidences between the thinking of Coleridge and that of the material- istic and mechanistic Hobbes occurs when Coleridge underscores the maxim that "it is a short and downhill passage from errors in words to errors in things."' Particularly in the confusion of reason with under- standing, he sees tragic evidence that Hobbes's principle is incontroverti- ble. Words, therefore, carry a large share of the responsibility for human error since to err in their use is to reproduce in parvo the process which results in misunderstanding the nature of existence. ] Aids to Reflection, ed. Thos. Fenby (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 21. 102</page><page sequence="3">Margaret L. Wiley When Coleridge lists in their order of importance the objects he had in mind when writing Aids to Reflection, the first is "to direct the Reader's attention to the value of the Science of Words, their use and abuse ... and the incalculable advantages attached to the habit of using them appropriately" (p. xiii). The rationale of this procedure is to be found in "the maxim, that to expose a sophism and to detect the equivocal or double meaning of a word is, in the great majority of cases, one and the same thing." It is significant also that, following a suggestion from Horne Tooke, he should think of words as not only the vehicle but the very wheels of the intellect, meaningless if not in motion. In relation to this concept, Coleridge's tendency to move easily from the language of logic to the language of imagination is to be seen in his subsequent appropria- tion of the pronouncement of Ezekiel, "for the Spirit of the living creature was in the Wheels also." Another approach to this same conclusion may be made via self- knowledge, which in the Biographia Literaria Coleridge equates with metaphysics. Not to be a thinking man, he argues, is not to be a man at all. And why would man have been endowed with self-consciousness if he were not in duty bound to know himself? Revelation is made avail- able only through self-knowledge, and the habit of reflection upon words is the indispensable prerequisite of such knowledge. Hence the person who is not curious and careful about words is cut off ultimately from the light of revelation, since it is accessible to men only through the diffrac- tion of language: "For if words are not THINGS, they are LIVING POWERS, by which the things of most importance to mankind are actuated, com- bined, and humanized" (p. xvii). Before we look at a few examples illustrative of the kind of distinc- tions Coleridge makes between words, let us see what theory lies behind them. For Coleridge, the spirit that denies might very well have been the spirit that divides. What continually impresses him is the unitive quality of existence. He recognizes that this must often be broken down into two or more parts in order to become intelligible to the human under- standing, but the unpardonable sin is to suppose that a di- or trichotomy represents a division in nature rather than a distinction made necessary by the difference in kind between man's experience and its intellectual formulation. This is quite in line with Coleridge's refusal to consider words as ends in themselves. They are always wheels, not mere vehicles. When he reads in Hooker, "The mixture of those things in speech, which by nature are divided, is the mother of all error," he counters with this: " 'The division in thought of those things which in nature are distinct, yet one, that is distinguished without breach of unity, is the mother,' -so I should have framed the position... the main arguments of the atheists, materialists, deniers of our Lord's divinity and the like, all 103</page><page sequence="4">Coleridge and the Wheels of Intellect rest on the asserting of division as a necessary consequence of distinc- tion."2 Part of what Coleridge admired in Kant was "the novelty and subtlety, yet solidity and importance, of the distinctions."3 The taking of such distinctions for divisions results in what Coleridge calls the "tod- dy punch" system of Descartes, who saw the world in terms of dichot- omies which must be bridged, instead of as a unity, for the understanding of which numerous transient distinctions must be employed. The erecting of dualisms into absolutes is one method of distorting and misusing words, for the person who does this is likely to forget the experience which necessitates the division of words and the experience which it is their destiny to illumine. As Coleridge wrote in the margin of his copy of Des- cartes, "This utter disanimation of Body and it's not opposition, but contrariety, sicuti omnina heterogeneum, to Soul, as the assumed Basis of Thought and will; this substitution, I say, of a merely logical negatio alterius in omni et singulo, for a philosophic antithesis necessary to the manifestation of the identity of both-2 1, as the only form in which the human understanding can represent to itself the 1 2, is the peccatum originale of the cartesian system."4 Coleridge allies himself more closely here with Donne, the poet, who created the image of "the subtle knot," than with Descartes, the philosopher, who provided the formula for it. Those who mistake distinctions for differences persuade themselves that by untying the knot they will be able to escape the implications of its subtlety. Two further applications of the principle laid down here concerning distinctions and divisions will show its ramifications and the consistency with which Coleridge employed it. The more one reads of him, the more likely it seems that the clue to his rejection of Unitarianism is to be found in its semantics rather than in its theology, or rather in its seman- tics as a reflection of its theology. After explaining how Unitarians aban- doned the name "Socinians," he says that their present name is applicable only to their opponents, "for unity or unition, and indistinguishable unicity or oneness, are incompatible terms: while, in the exclusive sense in which they mean the name to be understood, it is a presumptuous boast, and an uncharitable calumny."5 Alongside this distinction, in the same sermon, he sets a similar one between "the necessity of believing in Christ" and "a recommendation to believe Him," the former pointing toward oneness and the latter toward unity. 2 Notes on English Divines, ed. Derwent Coleridge (London, 1853), I, 21. 8 Biographia Literaria (London, 1894), p. 70. 4 Julian Lindsay, "Coleridge Marginalia in a Volume of Descartes," PMLA, XLIX (1934), 188. '"Lay Sermon to the Higher and Middle Classes," Biographia Literaria, p. 406. 104</page><page sequence="5">Margaret L. Wiley A second application occurs when Coleridge is berating Jeremy Tay- lor, one of his favorite seventeenth-century theologians, for his treatment of the dogma of original sin. Taylor has implied that God judged Adam on the basis of a generalization, and this prompts Coleridge to point out the incongruity between generalization and the divine nature. "General- ization is a Substitute for Intuition, for the Power of intuitive (that is, immediate) knowledge. As a Substitute, it is a gift of inestimable Value to a finite Intelligence, such as Man in his present state is endowed with and capable of exercising; but yet a Substitute only, and an imperfect one to boot. To attribute it to God is the grossest Anthropomorphism."6 It is evident from these examples that on the one side stand intuition and oneness and on the other generalization and unity and the "toddy punch" technique of adding items one by one to constitute a whole. The second category, Coleridge would concede, may at times be the only one avail- able to man, with his limited understanding; but he is not on that ac- count to rule out the possibility of the first. Any view of life which disregards this polarity, as Coleridge believed eighteenth-century ration- alism had, is headed for shipwreck on the rocks of whatever truths are unpredictable and accessible only to the intuition. One of the most practical uses to which the habit of making distinc- tions can be put is that of separating out the various meanings which have become attached to a single word. Coleridge does this notably for simplicity, obscurity, and wonder, and the analyses follow a traceable pattern. What he has heard in his day about the simplicity and plainness of the Christian religion makes him suspect that those who use such terms in their propaganda have in mind a religion whose fundamentals one can acquire within a few hours. Nothing could be further from his con- ception of Christianity as a system progressively revealed to the individ- ual who launches himself into the adventure of living it. Out of religious experience comes a perception of the great truths, not out of a cursory intellectual "briefing," which results in a mere theory. Yet there is a sense, Coleridge admits, in which the adjective simple might appropriate- ly be applied to Christianity: "All truth indeed is simple, and needs no extrinsic ornament. And the more profound the truth is, the more sim- ple: for the whole labour and building-up of knowledge is but one contin- ued process of simplification."7 Thus Coleridge salvages the misused word by penetrating to one of its deeper meanings. Likewise, man may confront the obscurity which merely confuses or the obscurity which is the result of superior illumination. Coleridge 6 Aids to Reflection, p. 240 n. 7 "Lay Sermon," Biog. Lit., p. 408. 105</page><page sequence="6">Coleridge and the Wheels of Intellect draws a striking comparison between a passage from Heraclitus (prover- bially known as "the dark") and one from the opening of John's gospel. Both of these might be called obscure, but their obscurity is of a kind which is shared with Socrates and the Hebrew prophets. "Obscurity is a word of many meanings. It may be in the subject; it may be in the au- thor; or it may be in the reader; and this again may originate in the state of the reader's heart; or in that of his capacity; or in his temper; or in his accidental associations."8 To reinforce these distinctions, Coleridge translates a passage from Plato, who contrasts the obscurity of the soph- ists, which results from sheer confusion, with that of the philosophers, which is the effect of an excess of light. Let us abjure the one, says Coleridge, and press on unceasingly toward the other. Both the highest kind of simplicity and the highest kind of obscurity tend to produce in the observer a sense of wonder. Here, too, there is a primary and a secondary wonder, whose distinguishing traits are set forth by Archbishop Leighton in one of the aphorisms of Aids to Reflec- tion: "In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends: and Admira- tion fills up the interspace. But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ig- norance: the last is the Parent of Adoration. The First is the birth- throe of our knowledge: the Last is its euthanasy and apotheosis" (p. 206). Simplicity, obscurity, and wonder then may characterize the heights or the depths of man's intellectual achievement. In the case of each word, the richer of its meanings is the precipitate of profound experience. In his comments on the use of the word spirit, Coleridge makes it quite clear that semantics must be centered in experience. He commends Leighton for vindicating the word spirit from "the sneers of the Sciolist," and the "perversions of the Fanatic." This is done by pointing out that because the New Testament writers still thought in Hebrew, even while they were writing in Greek, they used spirit in an auxiliary sense. "It is 'the Spirit of Meekness' (a meek Spirit), or 'the Spirit of Chastity,' and the like. The moral Result, the specific Form and Character in which the Spirit manifests its presence, is the only sure pledge and token of its presence; which is to be, and which safely may be, inferred from its practical effects, but of which an immediate knowledge or consciousness is impossible; and every pretence to such knowledge is either hypocrisy or fanatical delusion" (p. 53). Such usage comes very close to modern existentialism, and certainly would prevent the setting up of spirit as an entity in its own right. The statement might also be considered as a parable designed to point up the necessary connection between words 8 "Lay Sermon," p. 358. 106</page><page sequence="7">Margaret L. Wiley and action. Elsewhere Coleridge reduces to the absurd the notion that spirit can stand alone. The property of spirit, he says, is to improve, enliven, actuate some other thing, not to constitute a thing in its own name. The enthusiast may find one exception to this where the material itself is called Spirit. And when he calls to mind, how this spirit acts when taken alone by the unhappy persons who in their first exultation will boast that it is Meat, Drink, Fire, and Clothing to them, all in one-when he reflects, that its properties are to inflame, intoxicate, madden with exhaustion, lethargy, and atrophy for the Sequels-well for him, if in some lucid interval he should fairly put the question to his own mind, how far this is analogous to his own case. (p. 134) Thus Coleridge is an imperfect Platonist, who must continually return from flights into the empyrean in order to touch the solid earth. He would reject neither the body which incarnates spirit nor the letter which it is the function of spirit to enliven, not to kill. The important point is that spirit without a function is dead and meaningless. Anyone who knows the trend of Coleridge's philosophical thought will have seen how all the distinctions we have presented thus far point toward his most important pair of concepts, reason and understanding. Third in importance among the aims of Aids to Reflection is that of sub- stantiating this distinction, especially in view of the historical situation in which Coleridge finds himself. He is convinced that during the pre- vious century "the Truths, Interests and Studies that especially belong to the REASON, contemplative or practical" have fallen upon evil days, principally because the understanding has been stressed out of all pro- portion. He is proceeding as a result of the conviction that "whoever transfers to the understanding the primacy due to the Reason, loses the one and spoils the other" (p. xv). And those who use them synonymously, although they may cite Bacon for a precedent, are either led into mysti- cism with the fanatics or fall with the sciolists into the error of confusing a difference in kind with a difference in degree.9 Either is intellectually fatal. Ancient and modern authors, both before and after Bacon, are cited to prove that the distinction is a valid and fundamental one, that it has a long and impressive history, and that by disregarding such a distinction, eighteenth-century rationalism took the wrong turning. Coleridge finds both Kant and Leighton defining the understanding as "'the Faculty judging according to Sense.' . . .On the contrary, Reason is the Power of Universal and necessary Convictions, the Source and Substance of Truths above Sense, and having their evidence in them- selves" (p. 189). 9 Cf. Aids to Reflection, p. 222. 107</page><page sequence="8">Coleridge and the Wheels of Intellect Throughout his writings Coleridge rings changes on these two defini- tions, but he insists always upon the fact that the field of man's intel- lectual endeavor is divided between the two entities and that a man is wise in proportion to the discretion with which he makes use of them. Words are capable of encompassing a conception (the product of under- standing) but only of suggesting and pointing toward an idea (the off- spring of reason). As might be expected, the understanding handles all that is static, logical, and mechanical while the reason operates in the complex and moving realm of moral values. The speculative reason, which is responsible for formal principles, Coleridge identifies and labels, but he turns most of his attention to the practical reason. "Whenever by self-subjection to this universal Light, the Will of the Individual, the particular Will, has become a Will of Reason, the man is regenerate: and Reason is then the Spirit of the regenerated man, whereby the Per- son is capable of a quickening intercommunion with the Divine Spirit."10 Although man has a thousand daily uses for the understanding, his destiny is unfulfilled unless he keeps striving toward reason. The path to God Himself lies in this direction. And woe to him who tries to clamber up by using the ropes and ladders of a fatuous understanding. To such lengths may self-deception go that "wherever the forms of Reasoning appropriate only to the natural world are applied to spiritual realities, it may be truly said, that the more strictly logical the Reasoning is in all its parts, the more irrational it is as a whole."" Thus a misappropriation of reasoning may land us in the midst of the irrational. This misuse of a legitimate tool, Coleridge felt, accounted for the distorted world-view of eighteenth-century rationalism. It had cut itself off from that reason which is the living source of power and truth. "What then but appari- tions can remain to a philosophy which strikes death through all things visible and invisible; satisfies itself then only when it can explain those abstractions of the outward senses, which by an unconscious irony it names indifferently facts and phenomena, mechanically that is, by the laws of death; and brands with the name of mysticism every solution grounded in life, or the powers and intuitions of life?"'2 The havoc thus wrought by what Wordsworth condemned as the "false secondary power/By which we multiply distinctions" is the result of a reliance upon the human understanding alone, which varies from person to per- son, a reliance whose inevitable end is solipsism. What brings men to- gether and enables them to communicate with one another is their com- mon participation in reason, which Coleridge identifies with "the light that lighteth every man." This constitutes the highest common denom- 10 Aids to Reflection, p. 190. 1 Ibid., p. 222. 12 "The Statesman's Manual," Biog. Lit., p. 367. 108</page><page sequence="9">Margaret L. Wiley inator among men, and to urge a oneness on this level is Coleridge's answer to Herbert of Cherbury. Again he quotes Heraclitus, whose coin- cidence with John is remarkable: "To discourse rationally it behoves us to derive strength from that which is common to all men: for all human understandings are nourished by the one DIVINE WORD."13 To remain sensitive to such nourishing is to have insured against taking the part for the whole and also against remaining at ease in Zion. That the Logos should be the agent by which all this is effected lends prestige to the words of men. Perhaps in an insight like this, punning finds its ulti- mate and metaphysical justification. Coleridge's concern that words should not settle down permanently in the realm of the understanding (like his rejection of unity for unicity) is allied with his fear that religion in that case would become merely speculative and theoretical and so lose contact with what is lifegiving. Underlying his quarrel with deism is the conviction that it would unite men on the lower level of their understanding rather than on the higher level of their reason. What Coleridge opposes to this kind of deism is "that living and generative interpretation of both [reason and under- standing] which would give being to essential religion ... for the Al- mighty goodness does not create generalities nor abide in abstractions -in each, the meanest, object it bears witness to a mystery of infinite solution."'4 The implications of such statements for the nature and function of words are tremendous and ever-expanding. Coleridge's most serious criticism of Hooker is that he remained among conceptions with- out ever ascending to the "tranquil empyrean" of ideas, which alone have the power of life. "As the vital power compared with the mechanic; as a father compared with a moulder in wax or clay, such is the power of ideas compared with the influence of conceptions and notions."15 A key passage in The Friend illumines the ultimate value of knowing oneself since at the furthest stretch of self-knowledge one knows the whole with which he is merged. If a knowledge of words paves the way for a knowledge of self, then words may lift up their heads with a new dignity, a dignity whose final proof lies in the magnitude of the fundamental distinction between reason and understanding. Here is the ultimate justification of semantics. The risk of using words is akin to the risk of exercising the understanding, namely that we may depart from reality and build for ourselves a neat and closed system of meanings into which the breath of human experience shall never penetrate. The ground-work, therefore, of all pure speculation is the full apprehension of the difference between the contemplation of reason, namely, that intuition of '3 Aids to Reflection, p. 191. 14 "Statesman's Manual," Biog. Lit., p. 353. 15 Notes on English Divines, I, 15. 109</page><page sequence="10">Coleridge and the lWheels of Intellect things which arises when we possess ourselves, as one with the whole, which is substantial knowledge, and that which presents itself when transferring reality to the negations of reality, to the ever-varying framework of the uniform life, we think of ourselves as separated beings, and place nature in antithesis to the mind, as object to subject, thing to thought, death to life. This is abstract knowledge, or the science of mere understanding.16 Coleridge was trying to arouse those of his contemporaries who were complacently nursing their abstract knowledge and to plunge them again into the maelstrom from which they had sought to escape. He was willing to be charitable toward seventeenth-century divines whose confusion of reason and understanding was usually a verbal peccadillo. "But alas! since the Revolution, it has ceased to be a mere error of language, and in too many it now amounts to a denial of reason!"'7 Hence the seriousness of linguistic errors if they can reduce the thinking of a whole century to such darkness. It is ironical that Coleridge's most serious charge against the Age of Reason is that it denied the supremacy of reason. Possessed of (or by) the kind of intellectual system which we have sketched, it is not surprising that Coleridge often found himself accused of uttering paradoxes and contradictions. In Biographia Literaria he defends himself with the assertion that at least he did not evade the toil of thinking nor did he merely serve up the products of other men's thought. In either case his statements would not have proved disturb- ing. The "obscurity and love of paradox" which his readers complained of were not, as we can see, accidental flaws but were fundamental to his way of looking at the world. We know that his aim was not to avoid ob- scurity at all costs but to make sure that whatever obscurity charac- terized his writing was the obscurity of excessive light rather than that of darkness and confusion. As for his love of paradox, that is merely another link which binds him to the seventeenth-century sceptics. See with what enthusiasm he quotes such aphorisms as this from Leighton: "Self-superintendence! that any thing should overlook itself! Is not this a paradox, and hard to under- stand? It is, indeed, difficult, and to the imbruted sensualist a direct contradiction: and yet most truly does the poet exclaim, -Unless above himself he can Erect himself, how mean a thing is man!"'8 The very next aphorism shows us the lines of Coleridge's defense. Para- dox is to play a necessary role in his scheme of things, and he supports 16 The Complete Works of S. T. Coleridge, ed. W. G. T.

Wiley the Archbishop's conviction that "in a world, the opinions of which are drawn from outside shows, many things may be paradoxical, (that is, contrary to the common notion) and nevertheless true: nay, paradoxical, because they are true. How should it be otherwise, as long as the imagina- tion of the Worldling is wholly occupied by surfaces, while the Chris- tian's thoughts are fixed on the substance, that which is and abides, and which, because it is the substance, the outward senses cannot recognize" (p. 6). What is this but the central distinction between reason and under- standing? Farther on, Coleridge finds the basis for contradiction in the very nature of man. Why should fortune or circumstance ever pose a problem for human beings if not for the fact that they bear within them the contradiction between "the injunctions of the mind and the election of the will"? This is the "Riddle of Man" (p. 313), which colors all that he is and thinks and therefore appears inevitably in his most profound utterances. Historically, Coleridge is particularly interested in two outstanding manifestations of the paradoxical and contradictory, one classic and one medieval. Plato, he says, "leads you to see, that propositions in- volving in themselves contradictory conceptions, are nevertheless true; and which, therefore, must belong to a higher logic-that of ideas. They are contradictory only in the Aristotelian logic, which is the instrument of the understanding."19 This merely reinforces what we have already learned about the superior complexity of the reason over the understand- ing. Coleridge believes that often the controversy of two opponents on the level of the understanding could be settled by its assumption into the realm of the reason. "The controversy of the Nominalists and Realists was one of the greatest and most important that ever occupied the hu- man mind. They were both right, and both wrong. They each maintained opposite poles of the same truth; which truth neither of them saw, for want of a higher premiss" (p. 58). It was to supply a series of such higher premises that Coleridge felt himself dedicated. The resultant "system," as he says in Table Talk three years before his death, "opposes no other system, but shows what was true in each; and how that which was true in the particular, in each of them became error, because it was only half the truth. I have endeavoured to unite the insulated fragments of truth, and therewith to frame a perfect mirror" (p. 146). The kind of language which comes closest, Coleridge feels, to trans- mitting the truths of such experience undistorted is the language of imag- ination. His "shaping spirit of imagination" was the power which could give to "airy nothings/A local habitation and a name" and so restrain those truths which seem forever taking off into the realm of the incom- municable. And, as one would expect, the most important function of 19 Specimens of the Table Talk of S. T. Coleridge (New York, 1884), p. 59. 111</page><page sequence="12">Coleridge and the Wheels of Intellect this power was esemplastic, that of shaping into one. (It is characteristic of Coleridge to have used this coinage, in spite of cries of pedantry, to break through the accretions which surround the word imagination.) He contrasts the mechanical and generalizing histories of his own and the preceding century with those contained in the Scriptures. The latter, he says, are "the living educts of the imagination; of that reconciling and mediatory power, which incorporating the reason in images of the sense, and organizing (as it were) the flux of the senses by the permanence and self-circling energies of the reason, gives birth to a system of symbols, harmonious in themselves, and consubstantial with the truths of which they are the conductors."20 Such are the wheels which Ezekiel beheld. Elsewhere Coleridge explains that the understanding, once it becomes impregnated with imagination, is transformed into an intuitive and living power and so approaches the purlieus of reason.21 The imagination is therefore referred to as a synthetic and magical power which reveals itself in "the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities: of sameness, with difference; of the general, with the concrete; the idea, with the image; the individual, with the representative; the sense of novelty and freshness, with old and familiar objects; a more than usual state of emotion, with more than usual order; judgment ever awake and steady self-possession, with enthusiasm and feeling profound or vehe- ment."22 Here are illustrated at once the polarity and the dynamism which Coleridge admired in the thought of Bruno and which form the essential elements in his own method. Those who can see only the contradictions and paradoxes within the imagination are still operating on the level of the understanding, where, as we have seen, the over-rigorous application of one's limited insights may lead to distortion. But it is possible to transcend that level, and the availability of these dual approaches (via understanding or via reason) is both the despair and the promise of the intellectual life, which at its zenith is always on the verge of self-transcendence. Coleridge saw its heights as accessible only to those able to maintain the kind of innocence which undergirds the creative use of the imagination. "To find no Con- tradiction in the union of old and new, to contemplate the Ancient of Days, His words and His works, with a feeling as fresh as if they were now first springing forth at Htis fiat-this characterizes the minds that feel the riddle of the world and may help to unravel it!"23 BROOKLYN COLLEGE Brooklyn 10, N.Y. 20 "Statesman's Manual," Biog.
