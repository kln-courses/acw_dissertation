To make the testing of a generalization impossible in a statistical sense it would in any case be necessary for a considerable number of individuals to react to it, which implies a degree of shared knowledge, belief, estimates of importance and hatred of predictive social science which is unlikely. Because of the flourishing existence of an empirical political science dealing in limited generalizations, these and similar conditions must exist singly or in combination in most of the fields where political predictions are currently being made. This is not to deny that in a minority of cases the self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecy may make empirical checks difficult or impossible. Where this difficulty exists it may be balanced by its own potentiality as an explanation: e.g., of a run on a bank or of the bandwaggon effect in political campaigning.3 Politics and the Problem about 'Science' LINCOLN ALLISON* There is a continuing concern about whether politics can be made a science, revived in this Journal by Ake [Claude Ake, 'The Scientific Status of Political Science', II (I972), 109-I5], McLean and Postbrief ['"The Scientific Status of Political Science" - Two Comments', 1 (I972), by Iain McLean, 383-4, and Samuel Postbrief, 385-8]. The word in other languages does not appear to elicit the same arguments: in French, for example, the expression 'science politique' is far less problematical because the word 'science' lacks both the theoretical and emotive implications which belong to the English word 'science'. 'Science', after all, is only a word and a word which probably has more than an average share of nuance and ambiguity. It should not be taken too seriously. For a low-level, commonsense interpretation one might well look to the 'Editorial Policy' of this journal which refers only to 'clear and consistent use of words, logical and mathematical validity, and the use of appropriate evidence to substantiate empirical statements'. But I want to explicate a strong sense of 'science' in English, which carries clear and important theoretical presuppositions radically different from any possible properties of the study of politics. I shall state three such presuppositions. I. Science is uniform. The laws (causal relationships, theoretical conjunctions) which science expresses are interdependent. They reduce to the same fundamental terminology. The conceptual components of this terminology depend, at a particular time, on the state of science. At the moment the paradigm (to use Kuhn's expression) is that patterns of energy-in-space are fundamental. The uniformity of science implies a hierarchy of scientific propositions. Some propositions are much closer to the fundamental than others and can serve as criteria for the adjudication of lower-level propositions. One decides which of two accounts of why a bridge has collapsed is correct according to its compatibility with theoretical tenets; that is, one tries to rule out one account as im- possible because of what is generally postulated about the universe. On a grander scale two alternative general theories of chemistry are judged by their compatibility with theoretical physics. 2. Science is complete. If an event can be acknowledged, it must fall into the pattern of science. If it does not appear to fit, either the event or the science must be re-interpreted 3 For a discussion of the uses of the self-fulfilling prophecy as explanation see Robert Merton, Social Theory and Social Structure (Glencoe: Free Press, 1959), PP. 421-34. * School of Politics, University of Warwick</page><page sequence="2">Notes and Comments 25T so that it does. Science assumes the impossibility of random events: as a discourse it cannot proceed without this assumption. The behaviour, though not the actions, of human beings is, of course, a proper subject for science. 3. Science is unique. There can only be one scientific universe. That is to say: all events must be reducible to the fundamental terminology or the terminology must be changed to include them. There are no special theoretical problems raised by the application of science to human beings for events in the brain are no less reducible to energy-in-space than are events in the organic chemistry laboratory. However, there are a host of practical problems. One cannot, for example, study the sexual behaviour of humans by pouring hot wax over them during coitus as one does with cockroaches to record chemical change. These are old doctrines, though in a modern form. The first corresponds to Harring- ton's 'Uniformity of Nature' and the second to Kant's 'synthetic a priori' ('Every event has a cause'). This version is my own, though similar I would hope, to accounts given by Strawson, Harre and Toulmin, in that premises are claimed to be true, not about the world, but as the necessary preconditions for discourse. Now consider in comparison the states of discourse about politics (which I will refer to as political analysis). I. Political analysis is not uniform. Its descriptions, explanations and generalizations are not acceptably reducible to a fundamental terminology and there is no reason why they should be. An analysis of a situation in terms of political development is not reducible to an analysis in terms of power or vice versa. They can in some circumstances be treated as equally plausible alternatives. Two different accounts can be simply two different facets of social analysis. 2. Political analysis is not complete. Random events can take place in politics. A psycho- pathic assassination, a natural disaster, a politician's brainstorm can all have political effects but do not have political or even social explanations. They must have scientific explanations. Put simply: science can and must aspire to explain every event within its realm; political analysis cannot and does not need to have this aspiration. 3. Political analysis is not unique. We may be curious as to why racial conflict has broken out in a particular place but there may be narrative, economic, psychological and sociological accounts, as well as political accounts, of why the events occurred. All these accounts may be conceptually autonomous, each neither supporting nor directly refuting the others. These doctrines would appear to give political analysis a 'low scientific status' in Ake's words and, indeed, I find this is often the reaction of honours politics under- graduates to their explication. Such a response is misplaced. Social discourse (of which political analysis, including explanation, is a part) is not 'lower' than, but completely separate from, scientific discourse. Social explanation is based on insight or introspective analogy ('verstehen' as Weber called it), the feeling that one knows what it feels like to be an actor of type x performing an action of type y. If I am puzzled about why so many working-class electors vote for the Conservative Party, I solve my puzzle by changing my mental analogue (an analogue with individually non-necessary components in the case of aggregative phenomena) of habits, attitudes and beliefs involved in being working-class. I can then partially check my analogue against data; if it stressed increasing wealth and I find no real relation between wealth and Toryism among working-class voters, I must rebuild. But no analogue is completely 'testable' (Ake's word) nor does any interesting analogue consist only of its 'testable' propositions. Furthermore, my analogue is only an explan- ation to an audience possessing some common cultural factors with both myself and</page><page sequence="3">252 Notes and Comments the subject matter. There are good reasons why history should be rewritten each gener- ation and why Martians probably cannot understand it at all. The account above may sound like dualism: on the one hand, there is a physical universe which possesses certain properties; on the other, a social universe with radically different properties. This is not a fair inference. There is only one universe, though human beings within it can be described and explained in two separate discourses. The physical discourse conceives them as brains, responses and patterns of behaviour while the social discourse conceives them as minds, actions and relationships. In the physical discourse they are of the same stuff as the rest of the universe. In the social discourse they are of separate stuff (except, of course, in primitive anthropomorphic cultures which conceive physical objects as essentially spirit-manifestations). Propositions in a social discourse can become so general and 'testable' that they develop formal similarities to scientific discourse, but this should never blind us to the essential differences. It is generally agreed that the study of politics as practised is 'unscientific'. Ake sees this as a consequence of our failures, McLean as a consequence of the uniquely human situation of choice, and Postbrief sees our differences as being the differences between law-like certainty and inductive probability. Each of these accounts is limited and misleading. The real difference is that the study of politics is necessarily part of a discourse which is of a totally different order to 'science' in the strong, theoretical, sense. 'Science' is exactly what political analysis is not. Local Party Organization, Turnout and Marginality BEN PIMLOTT* In a recent Note in this Journal ('Does Local Party Organization Matter?', III (I972), 381-3) I reported evidence which suggested that in local elections party organization could have a major impact.' This conclusion was reached by comparing voting move- ments in a marginal Newcastle ward, Walkergate, where Labour organization was very weak in 1970 but strong in 1971, with changes in Newcastle as a whole. In this Note a similar comparison is made, with evidence drawn from a Conservative ward, Heaton, in 1972, which shows even more striking evidence of organizational impact. Recent discussion in this and other journals about ward marginality and turnout2 is considered in the light of this evidence. THE CAMPAIGN The effect of organization can be seen most clearly because in 1971 Heaton was virtually untouched by Labour Party workers. In 1971 the constituency and ward Labour parties had decided to concentrate all of their attention on marginal Walkergate. The adjacent ward of Heaton was entirely neglected apart from a delivery of the election address. Even the Heaton Labour candidate spent election day ferrying Walkergate voters to the polls. In 1972 constituency strategy changed. The apparent success of organization in * Lecturer in Politics, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. See also J. M. Bochel and D. T.
