<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 89 A Synopsis of the first three Gospels, Huck-Lietzmann, English Edition by F. L. Cross, Mohr, Ttibingen, 1936. This is the first English edition since 1907. Huck's Greek Synopse, long a standard instrument of Gospel study, has recently appeared in a new ninth edition prepared by Hans Lietzmann. Students in England and America will be particularly grateful to the publisher for issuing this new edition also in an English form, with English introduction, comparative tables and pericope-headings. Prepared from entirely new plates using a modern Greek font, the new Huck-Lietzmann adds to the time-proven system of subject matter division a greatly improved textual apparatus. In certain sections (e. g. Mc. 8 27--9 32) the apparatus has been extended beyond the normal measure to provide materials for simpler textual exercises. The comparative material from extra-canonical sources given in the footnotes is rich and thoroughly up to date. CARL KRAELING The Mind of Paul, by Orwin Edman, Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1935. This book makes no claim to be a work of scholarship and is misleading as a popular exposition. Its author explains that "for all the wealth of Pauline scholarship it has, with few notable exceptions, been lost in philological minutiae or been interested in making theological points; the purely historical researches in philology need to be supplemented by a critical interpretation of the mind of Paul;" but he has hardly learned that neither sound criticism nor correct interpretation is possible without adequate philological and historical preparation, and this is particularly evident in his apparent unfamiliarity with his sources or with recent literature. A few quotations from Paul and Acts in Moffatt's translation, and large borrowings from Loisy and Foakes Jackson supplement the author's own philosophic and psychological ideas. In spite of his sceptical attitude toward psychological study, he does not hesitate to maintain that as a missionary Paul had delusions of grandeur (p. 8) or to remark that "it is not impossible to accuse of monomania one who could spend so much of the second Epistle to the Corinthians justifying the fact that 'in nothing am I behind the very chiefest of the apostles' " (p. 45): statements which show a remarkable misunderstanding of Paul's words and mind. On p. 11 it is said that Paul's "conception of Sin and the Flesh is largely Jewish in origin and character," but elsewhere "Paul's sense of the flesh as identical with radical evil</page><page sequence="2">90 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE is to be attributed far more to his affinities with borrowings from Greek thought than from the Hebrew tradition" (p. 63) and "the emphasis he placed on sin and indeed his very conception of its nature was non-rabbinic in character. If it was Jewish at all it was that Judaism of the Diaspora, profoundly modified by its Greco-Oriental religious development" (p. 72). On page 67 comes the remarkable statement: "Proselytizing was unknown to traditional Judaism" a view which though G. F. Moore partly shared it, is contradicted by St. Matthew; and on page 78 the eschatology of I Cor. 15 is described as a Greek not a Jewish "mystery." On page 84 Paul is depicted as "the founder of a new religion," but on p. 169 it is said that "in its specific charac- teristics, Paul's ethics turn out to be the ethics which Jesus had preached in terms simply of the imminence of the Kingdom of God." A curiously one-sided bibliography concludes the book. ROBERT P. CASEY By Light, Light. The Mystic Gospel of Hellenistic Judaism, by Erwin R. Goodenough, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1935. The serious defect of many books which claim to deal with the history of religion is that they heap together unnecessary detail on well known fact and do very little else. They do not perceive the difference between information and understanding. The result is that many "learned" books merely duplicate informa- tion, and it is delightful to find in Goodenough's By Light, Light a book remarkable for its addition to understanding, though it also adds to information. The question asked and answered in By Light, Light is: What was the religion of Philo, and how did it affect his theology? I will venture to paraphrase the answer: In the Hellenistic world in the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era the anthropomorphic theology of the Greeks had been changed by its impregnation with philosophy. Edu- cated men no longer really thought of their spiritual necessities and the satisfaction of those necessities in anthropomorphic terms, but in philosophic ones. They formulated their spiritual needs in terms of "reality," which is infinite, and untrammeled by material limitations, and they believed that sometimes at least they could break the limitations and reach the reality beyond. The limitations were "humanity" and the reality beyond was by implication "deity". This is termed Mysticism by Goodenough, and I think cor- rectly. But one of the most pressing necessities of intellectual</page></plain_text>
