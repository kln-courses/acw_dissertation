<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kancil: From Mischief to Moral Education KATHIE CARPENTER The mouse deer' (Kancil in Indonesian) is a small, rare forest an- imal found in Java, Borneo, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Tra- ditionally, Kancil has been portrayed in folktales as quick-witted but cunning and even deceitful. Recently however, Kancil has begun to appear in written children's stories, as well as other media such as wayang kulit (shadow puppet) and tape cassettes, as a wise and respon- sible creature, often with the author's explicit stated goal of present- ing an appropriate role model in children's education. In this paper, I will compare oral versions of Kancil stories with modern, written ones, in order to illustrate how the images we humans project onto animals have more to do with meeting our own needs than with the natural history of the animal itself, and how those projections change as a society's perceived needs change. THE MOUSE DEER The mouse deer is the world's smallest deer. In height it is under 30 centimeters, in weight just one to two kilos. It is an attractive animal, with a reddish brown coat tipped in black, and white high- lights. It is timid and easily startled, with wide eyes and a small stubby tail it tucks close to its body when frightened, and its spindly front legs are shorter than its hind legs. The males have tusks that protrude back to the cheeks, giving them a dashing, mustachioed air. In habit, though, the animal is timid, nocturnal and solitary. It is presently endangered and protected by the Indonesian government. The 1. Also known as chevrotain in English, and pelandok in Malay. There are two species found in Indonesia and Malaysia: Tragulusjavanicus, the Lesser Mouse Deer, and Tragulus napu, the Large Mouse Deer. Western Folklore 51 (April 1992): 111-127 111</page><page sequence="2">112 WESTERN FOLKLORE mouse deer is a primitive ruminant, meaning it chews its cud, and subsists mostly on leaves, grass and fruit. A description of the little mouse deer, and the impression it cre- ates, can in no way capture the importance of this animal in the Malay and Javanese oral traditions, and it comes as a surprise, therefore, that Kancil is a powerful, and not entirely adorable, figure in the folklore of the region. KANCIL STORIES Kancil stories abound in Malaysia, Java and Borneo.2 Kancil in- stantiates many of the most highly-prized values of traditional societ- ies of the region. Here is an example:3 The mouse-deer had run away when he realized the tiger was ap- proaching. As he ran in the dark he fell into a deep pit from which he could not get out. An elephant was passing and he looked down at him. "Hey" shouted the mouse-deer "the sky is falling down. Quick, jump in here." So the elephant jumped in. After a little while a wild cow came by and looked down at them. "Quick! Jump down here, the sky is falling down," cried the mouse-deer, and the wild cow did as he was told. A deer came by and a barking deer, and to each the mouse deer told the same story and they were all down in the pit with him. After a little while the mouse-deer pinched them all very hard, and the elephant got angry with him and picked him up with his trunk and threw him back up on the ground. Once there, the mouse-deer called to them "I lied to you, I lied to you, the sky is not falling down." The animals in the pit all cried when they heard this, but the mouse-deer ran away. He went to the Malay prince and he prostrated himself in front of him. "Oh mas- ter" he said "I can show you where you can find an elephant, wild cow, deer and barking deer. They have all fallen down into a deep pit." The prince's men followed the mouse-deer, and when they came to the pit, they killed all the animals inside it (Howell 1982). Several of Kancil's characteristics stand out as particularly salient in this story. The animal uses his wits to get out of a fix that the pred- atory nature of the tiger has put him into, but he does so at the expense of other animals. Indeed, he lies readily when it meets his own needs, and also provokes the other animals by pinching them in 2. Interestingly, although mouse deer are also found in Sumatra, I have so far not found any Kancil stories from Sumatra. Although this is probably simply an accident due to incomplete data collection, one intriguing alternative explanation for this is that Sumatra is the only of these areas where rabbits coexist with mouse deer. 3. This story and the ones that follow are drawn from a variety of sources, listed in the bibli- ography. The name of the collection can be found in parentheses at the end of each.</page><page sequence="3">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 113 order to get out of the pit. By using his wits, he easily not only escapes but effectively uses the other animals' negative emotions (fear and irritation) against them. This passage also illustrates Kancil's interme- diate status between human and animals, and his effectiveness as a diplomat between these two worlds. Although the pronoun system of Indonesian and Malay do not specify whether they refer to a male or a female, Kancil is generally perceived as a male creature, and indeed in many stories his maleness and sexuality figure prominently in the plot. The next story illustrates the sexual prowess of the traditional Kancil figure and his use of his sexuality to destroy the tiger. Once there was a mouse-deer that was the husband of a tiger ... The tiger then told the mouse-deer that she was pregnant and due to give birth. She asked him to fetch the medicine from the jungle. He went and picked leaves of the wrong kind. They were full of maggots. These he gave to his wife telling her they were the correct leaves for child- birth. She placed them on her vulva and the maggots entered her vagina. The mouse-deer looked at her and said "You have broken the birth pantang (taboo), they were the wrong leaves." The tiger died. (Howell 1982) In this story, not only is Kancil able to have sexual relations with a tiger, but he impregnates her, and ultimately causes her to die as a direct result of their union. Kancil's cross-species sexual privileges even extend in a limited fashion to humans, as in the following story, in which although a marriage between Kancil and a human never actually takes place, the possibility is presented as a credible and cru- cial feature of the plot: The farmer was fed up with Kancil raiding his cucumbers, and he devised a scare-crow that would take advantage of Kancil's insatiable curiosity. He covered the scare-crow with sticky stuff and left it to guard the garden. That night, Kancil came to steal more cucumbers, and he saw the scare-crow. Of course, far from being frightened, he was curi- ous, and went over to it to see what it wold say. "Hey you--what are you doing here all alone at night?" The scare-crow said nothing. Kancil poked it, and his foot stuck to it. He tried to push it away, but he just got more and more stuck. He was trapped! The next morning, the farmer came and put the Kancil into a cage. Later, the farmer's dog came to taunt the Kancil, but the Kancil took the offensive. "Hey, dummy" he said. "Have you noticed all the goings on around this house lately?" "No," the dog said. "No? How could you</page><page sequence="4">114 WESTERN FOLKLORE not notice? Great preparations are being made for a grand feast, be- cause tomorrow I am to be married to the farmer's daughter. He's keeping me in this special house to meditate before the ceremony. Don't you wish you could marry with the farmer's daughter? There will be great feasting and festivities." "Yes, I wish I could marry with the farmer's daughter" said the dog, enviously. "Well, all you have to do is trade places with me" said the Kancil helpfully. "When the farmer comes here tomorrow, he'll marry you to his daughter instead of me." So, of course, the dog opens the cage and gets inside, and the Kancil escapes.4 Kancil is always an individual, and always individuated. That is, stories never contain more than one mouse deer, and in the stories for which I was able to obtain versions in Indonesian, he is introduced as "Kancil" rather than as "a kancil (seekor kancil)." Although Kancil sometimes teams up with other animals, he remains at heart self- interested, and readily abandons and even betrays associates when it is advantageous to do so: Once upon a time the tiny mouse-deer and the water-tortoise went out together to find fruit. They found a tree laden with ripe fruit close by a house. "I can't climb up that tree" said the mouse-deer, "but I'll give you a leg up, and then you can get on to that branch." So he pushed up the tortoise onto the lowermost branch. Tortoise threw down all the fruit, but then didn't know how to get down, and called to Mouse-deer for help. "Oh! Get down anyway you like," said Mouse-deer. "But I can't get down forwards and I can't get down backwards." "Then throw yourself down" said Mouse-deer, and Tortoise threw himself down and came to the ground with a great thud. The people in the house heard the sound and said "There's a durian falling." (Mouse-deer of course escapes with the fruit, while the tortoise is captured, and left to his own devices) (Hose and McDougall 1966). It must be pointed out that Kancil is a beloved character in tradi- tional folklore. As pointed out in Geertz (1960) Kancil represents the "little man" caught up in forces he cannot control, who must live by his wits simply to survive. While many of the characteristics Kancil personifies may seem unsavory to members of other cultures, espe- cially when listed out of context (lies, tricks, steals, betrays, boasts), each of these has an alternative interpretation that is far less malign, and which indeed represents very important traditional values. Kancil is always in control, he never runs amuck, he never creates chaos inadvertently. He is the master of the "surgical strike"-he carefully 4. Collected and translated by myself in Malang, East Java, during the summer of 1989.</page><page sequence="5">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 115 plots his revenge on tiger or crocodile, and directs the effects to them alone, not dragging in other animals inadvertently. Contrast this with an elephant, which although not even a carnivore, can run amuck and smash entire villages. The traditional stories follow a highly predictable format. The lis- tener can be confident that Kancil will always use his wits to make a fool of a mightier beast, either tiger, elephant or crocodile: Tiger was after Mouse-deer, about to pounce on him. Mouse-deer ran in fear to a place under some bamboos. The wind blew in the bamboos and they squeaked rubbing together, and Mouse-deer said to Tiger: "Hear that? It is a magic flute. If a person can blow this flute, he will be healthy forever." So Tiger wanted to blow the flute and Mouse-deer told him he'd show him how to do it. He said Tiger should put his tongue between the two bamboo trees, which Tiger did, and when the wind blew his tongue got caught and Mouse-deer got away free (Geertz 1960). Episodes such as the preceding can be linked in a never-ending series of vignettes, linked together with "Another time, ... ." The sto- ries are always about Kancil, and Kancil never appears in an inciden- tal role. For example, although mouse deer were hunted and eaten by some groups in the area, there is never mention of Kancil as part of a meal, or as an animal incidentally encountered while traveling through the jungle. The next story shows Kancil the flatterer, both an astute judge of character in uncovering other creatures' weakness, as well as the arch manipulator in exploiting those weaknesses for his own purposes: A mouse-deer was walking along the bank of a river. He could see several crocodiles lying in the mud at the side of the river. "Hey friends!" he called out. "You are really very big and strong! You could easily conquer any country if you wanted to." "Of course, Mr. Mouse- deer" answered the crocodiles. "Even men are afraid of us. Look how well we are armed." They showed the mouse-deer their sharp claws and teeth and waved their tails slowly backwards and forwards. "With one blow we can knock a man down." "Everything you say is true" said the mouse-deer "but I would like to know how many of you there are. Can you please form a line across the river so that I can count you?" The crocodiles did as they were told. They formed a line from one side of the river to the other. The mouse-deer jumped down lightly on the back of the nearest crocodile. "One, two, three" he counted as he walked across the river on their backs. When he reached the other side, he jumped quickly onto the bank. "Thank you very much, gentlemen"</page><page sequence="6">116 WESTERN FOLKLORE he called out. "I didn't want to get my feet wet crossing the river." The crocodiles roared in anger. "Don't forget, mouse-deer" they shouted. "we can live on land as well as in the water. One day we shall catch you and teach you a good lesson." "Ha ha ha" laughed the mouse-deer (Comber 1984).5 The contrast between Kancil and the predators is clear in this story. The crocodiles' own vanity makes them willing dupes for the Kancil, and their overwhelming self-satisfaction turns quickly to overwhelm- ing rage when they realize they have been duped. In both, they are out of control, and Kancil simply laughs at their anger. It is significant that Kancil always beats the predators and larger animals by turning their own weaknesses and weapons against them. Most importantly, he uses the force of their negative emotions (rage, fear, arrogance, greed) as the power source for his revenge. For example, his flattery of the crocodiles only makes use of their own conceit, the source of the animals in the pit's undoing is their own panic at his lies, the dog is tricked by his own envy and lust, and, in one story, tiger is eaten by crocodiles only because he panics and runs straight into the river. Stories often end with the predator showing lack of self-control by openly expressing rage, while Kancil displays his superior control by simply laughing. Not only does he use other creatures' negative emo- tions as the weapons in their own destruction, but the contrast in physical strength can be the source of his survival and their own demise, as in the following story, in which the tiger cub, because of his carnivore's teeth, cannot eat safely off his own kneecap the way that Kancil can. The mouse-deer and the tiger child wandered into the jungle. They found some fruit. The mouse-deer placed it on his kneecap and ate it. The tiger also wanted some. The mouse-deer pretended to put some on the tiger's knee-cap and he (the tiger-child) bit at it, biting off his own knee-cap, and after awhile he died (Howell 1982). Although eating from one's own kneecap is an unusual ability to take pride in, the ingenious Kancil is able to turn any apparent weak- ness (his bare, spindly legs) into a strength in the struggle with an adversary. 5. This story is actually already one step removed from traditional folklore, since it is drawn from an English reader for Malaysian and Indonesian students. Although the language is clearly not typical of the traditional style, the tale is a traditional one, and it illustrates this aspect of Kancil's personality quite effectively.</page><page sequence="7">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 117 The whiskers of a tiger figure prominently in many folktales of the region, evidently as the seat of the tiger's vanity and virility, and therefore the source of his downfall as well. The size, virility and brute force of a tiger are never a match for the mouse deer's wits: The king of the tigers sent his emissaries to Borneo, to seek tribute, food and slaves. Before sending them off, he plucked a single whisker from his jaw, so everyone they met could see what a big and virile tiger he was. In Borneo, the tigers came first upon the mouse-deer, and they commanded him to announce their demands to his own king, taking the whisker with him as proof of their serious intent. Kancil accepted it politely, but once out of their sight, he ran in search of his friend the porcupine. "Oh please, for the sake of all of us, give me one of your biggest, fattest, sharpest quills" he requested, and the porcupine did. Kancil returned to the tigers, and announced "My king says welcome to Borneo, and he welcomes meeting you in battle also. It has been too peaceful here of late, and he grows bored. He thanks your king for the whisker, and sends you one of his own in return" and the Kancil handed over the porcupine quill. "Hmmm" said the tigers. "Hmmm. We'll certainly give the message to our king" and they hastily departed. They returned to their own king and repeated the message. "Hmmmm" said the tiger king. "Hmmmmm. Borneo really has so little to offer, it's not worth our while to take the trouble to go there again. This year, we'll see what kind of goods and tribute the elephant kings of Sumatra have at their disposal" (Cole 1982). Kancil the flatterer is also Kancil the braggart, and his arrogance is illustrated in the following story: Mouse-deer was strutting around wearing a snake as a belt, bragging because he alone could wear it. He called out to the other animals "Hey, dummies! Don't you wish you could wear this snake as a belt? But you can't, only I can."6 Although Kancil's arrogance is acknowledged as a character weak- ness, the fact remains that it is justified--he is lucky as well as quick- witted, and he does have a privileged relationship with both humans and with forces such as fate and traditional deities and prophets. The reason, for example, that he gives, for alone being able to wear the snake as a belt is that he is the favorite of King Solomon, the protector of animals. While offensively boastful, the fact remains that it is true--he alone can wear the snake, as Tiger finds out when he tries it. 6. Collected by myself in Malang, summer 1989.</page><page sequence="8">118 WESTERN FOLKLORE Both through skillful diplomacy and through inherent authority, Kancil has a privileged relationship with humans as well. In the fol- lowing story, he is able to issue orders to human villagers and they obey. The mouse-deer told the villagers to lie in a row with their heads facing the river. He placed himself opposite. In the night he smelled that a tiger was near ... He (the tiger) came up to the house and saw all the villagers' heads lying in a row. He went up to investigate what they were and he bent his head over them to smell. His whiskers got inside their nostrils and they all sneezed. The tiger became very frightened and he ran away as fast as he could. But he ran straight into the river where the crocodiles ate him (Howell 1982). When he is captured by humans, he escapes by tricking the hu- man's representative, namely the dog. Fate smiles on him as well. While he couldn't predict that the tiger would cause the villagers to sneeze, they indeed do. Notice in this story too, the tiger's undoing is his own loss of control, running blindly in panic to the river, where the crocodiles finish him off. Once again, Kancil uses his enemy's own negative emotions to undo him. The traditional Kancil stories follow a highly predictable structure, and the outcome is always the same--Kancil makes a fool of his ad- versary. The surprise and delight come from the ingenious ways he devises to defeat the tiger, the elephant and the crocodile, as well as the satisfaction we feel when the underdog turns the tables on larger and more aggressive enemies. Rather than boring listeners, the pre- dictability of the traditional stories was probably reassuring, and pro- vided a counter balance to the precariousness of real life, at a time when the outcome of villagers' own encounters with tigers and croc- odiles were much less predictable. Thus, taken at face value, they acted as a kind of safety valve, venting and vanquishing, at least tem- porarily, humans' own fear of tiger and crocodile. On a more subtle level, though, they also expressed villagers' resentments and fears of other forces of institutionalized authority over which they had no control. Kancils' amorality must have been very attractive to villagers subject to the absolute authority of a caste system and monarchy that derived its legitimacy divinely, and which it was not only forbidden, but sacreligious to defy. The mouse deer figure also exemplifies quick-wittedness, as well as identification with the underdog rather than the authority figure, in</page><page sequence="9">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 119 proverbs and animal epithets as well as folktales. For example, there is the saying "When the elephants battle, the mouse deer gets crushed underfoot," as well as the simile "As clever as a kancil." The traditional anthropomorphism of the mouse deer expresses the resentments and fears of a people who felt powerless in the face of destructive forces of nature as well as human authority, and it expresses the fantasies of revenge against those forces that they are unable to act out any other way. They also reflect a society where children's education does not deliberately seek to isolate them from reproduction and death, and they exemplify ethical values that come from bottom up, that is, from ordinary people, rather than from above, from institutions and au- thority figures. These are things that are changing in Indonesia's transition to a modern nation-state. Modern education seeks to pro- tect children from reproduction and death. Because school systems are created by institutions of authority, educational materials have a different goal-to reinforce respect for authority rather than vent feelings of helplessness in the face of authority. In the modern nation- state, too, institutional authority must use means other than divine right to legitimate its authority. How does children's literature reflect these changing social values and concerns? THE PANCACILACISATION OF A TRICKSTER Kancil is a fun character, but perhaps not entirely savory as an example that modern, urban parents might like to hold up to their children, and it therefore may come as a surprise that the mouse deer has become the animal most featured in books and other media con- structed for children in modern Indonesia. There are, however, Kan- cil picture books for young children, Kancil stories that appear in collections of stories for older children, Kancil tape cassettes, and even Kancil wayang, including one "Kancil di sekolah" that instructs children on proper behavior at school. But, to meet this new role, Kancil's character is both changing and being changed.7 Folktales often carry rebellious or anti-authority themes. Such themes are inherent and necessary to their traditional cathartic role, but such themes are something that authority itself is unlikely to 7. Actually, the process has probably been going on for a long time. Winstedt (1969) presents evidence that many of the Kancil stories are actually descended from rabbit stories brought from India, and traces certain historical pathways and trends. However, there is a synchronic coherence to the Kancil stories that legitimates analyzing them from the society member's perspective as all given at a particular point in time.</page><page sequence="10">120 WESTERN FOLKLORE promulgate deliberately. Why would educators choose a cunning, ly- ing thief as the primary figure in children's educational books, par- ticularly those that are aimed at children's moral education? There are several reasons. Firstly, Kancil is simply a very important figure in traditional folklore, and it is natural that he would continue to be important. Secondly, there is the natural attraction that naughty char- acters seem universally to have for children (and for adults as well!) The stories are fun in large part because Kancil can act out the lis- teners' fantasies about revenge with those who have done one harm, or getting even with arbitrary authority. The choice of Kancil prob- ably reflects adults' intuitions that children are more likely to pay attention to and be interested in characters that break the rules. And finally, it is important to realize that although Kancil lies, plays tricks and manipulates, these traits are inevitable concomitants of important traditional virtues-Kancil is never openly confrontational or out of control; he uses his wits instead of his might, and he is a skilled diplomat. These are highly valued characteristics, and one would ex- pect modern children's literature to play these up, while simulta- neously downplaying some of the traits that might be viewed less favorably in a modern nation-state. For example, it is difficult to imagine how an individualistic and self-interested figure could be- come a proponent of gotong royong, and one would predict that these facets of Kancil's traditional character would be downplayed or ex- punged in present-day children's literature. Other traits are more compatible with the goals and values of modern Indonesian edu- cation, and one would expect them to be emphasized in versions of the stories published for children today. The question of how one uses a character that functions as a vicarious experiencer of anti- authoritarianism to carry a pro-social message to children can only be answered by specific examination of how traits that remain highly valued are emphasized, while traits that are less compatible with mod- ern society's values are deemphasized. The changes are of two main types-changes in the structure of the stories, and changes in the character of the animal itself. The traditional Kancil tales were not subject to the time and space constraints that mark bound and published story books, and were able to go on and on in a never-ending series of episodes in which Kancil inevitably and repeatedly made a fool of large powerful animals. The traditional stories range anywhere from one to nine episodes in length, although the figure nine iscertainly arbitrary, and probably</page><page sequence="11">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 121 dozens could be told in an evening. They are loosely linked together with an informal connector such as "Another time .. ." In contrast, the later stories follow a conventional, Western-style plot structure, with a scene-setting beginning, introduction of a problem, and Kan- cil's resolution of the problem. One story, though, is transitional, and its plot structure is interesting because, strange though it is, it paves the way for the entry of Kancil into modern written literature:8 The Clever Kancil Intro: Since the time they are small, children need to be given stories that are interesting as well as educational. In this book are presented some pictures that can be told about by the teacher. It is hoped that children can take good examples while avoiding anything that is not praiseworthy. The colored pictures are to attract children to inspect and understand the content of this book. Short sentences with large type are intended as reading practice. This book is for pre-school age children. It is hoped that it is of use. Clever Mouse-deer looks for food in the forest. The tiger is about to pounce on the Mouse-deer. Mouse-deer waits by a sleeping snake. Ti- ger fights with the snake. Mouse-deer with a bee hive. Tiger is swarmed by the bees. Mouse-deer beneath the clump of bamboo. Tiger's tongue gets squeezed in the bamboo. Mouse-deer waits by the buffalo manure. Tiger eats the buffalo manure. Mouse-deer wishes to cross the river. Mouse-deer is carried across by the crocodile. Mouse-deer covers up the well. Tiger falls into the well. Mouse-deer falls into the well. The ele- phant helps Mouse-deer but can't get out itself. Tiger wishes to pounce on Mouse-deer. Tiger gets shot. Mouse-deer steals cucumbers. Mouse- deer gets caught. Mouse-deer gets put in a cage. The dog is tricked into the cage by the Mouse-deer. Mouse-deer gets stranded by a flood. Mouse-deer gets carries across the water by a fish (Surasdi 1985a). The text of this story is accompanied by illustrations that portray the "before and after" of each episode. Even with the illustrations, though, this story is completely inexplicable to someone from outside the culture. There is no explanation of how Kancil convinces the tiger to fight with the snake, eat the buffalo manure, get shot or stick his tongue into the bamboo. Obviously, the author feels it is safe to as- sume that the reader already knows these stories, and in fact he al- ludes to this in the introduction, for example, warning teachers to 8. This and all the children's stories that follow are written in Indonesian and illustrated by Surasdi. The translations are my own, and deliberately follow the original quite closely, in order to give a flavor for the kind of language that is considered appropriate for young readers. For example, the repetitiveness and stilted quality are present in the original, and reflect the universal tendency for primers to aim for "short, complete sentences" even when this results in odd, artificial- sounding language.</page><page sequence="12">122 WESTERN FOLKLORE avoid saying anything that is not "praiseworthy." The author of Kan- cil Yang Cerdik has written many other books, but none of the other introductions contains such a warning, suggesting that the author is aware of the precariousness of bringing Kancil into the domain of literature targeted specifically at children. This story represents a cautious attempt to take advantage of the importance and appeal of Kancil for educational purposes, while ridding the stories of some of the less savory incidents. The stories published after Kancil yang cerdik have a conventional children's story book story structure--the scene is set, the problem is introduced, and the Kancil resolves the problem. The most important structural change is in the role of the narrator, and what the narrator must explicitly state, rather than take for granted. The stories must now contain explicit statements of how "bad" the tiger or other large, destructive animals are, and how Kan- cil's tricks are simply in response to some provocation. The narrator sets a new context in which Kancil's traits and behaviors are inter- preted, and paves the way for the reinterpretation of many traits which might seem inappropriate for modern children's education. In other words, the carnivores must be portrayed as explicitly "asking for it" in order to justify the deceit used against them. Kancil's small size and relative physical weakness are also explicitly stated, so the reader can see that he has no choice but to resort to trickery if he wishes to survive. This is clear in the next story, in which the Kancil punishes a crocodile for its lack of gratitude: The Fable of the Crocodile and the Buffalo It's a really hot day. Crocodile takes shelter under a shady tree. Croc- odile falls asleep because he is overtaken with exhaustion. Suddenly a strong wind comes up. The shady tree falls down. The crocodile's body is pinned down by the tree. The crocodile moans in pain. The crocodile cries. The crocodile tries to call for help. Luckily, a water buffalo passes by. The crocodile asks the buffalo for help. The buffalo feels sorry seeing the crocodile. The buffalo lifts the tree from the body of the crocodile. The crocodile can breathe freely. The body of the crocodile feels light again. The crocodile doesn't express any thanks. In fact, the crocodile asks for more help from the water buffalo. The crocodile wants to be carried across to the other side of the river. The buffalo is ready to help the crocodile again. The buffalo carries the crocodile. The buffalo crosses the river. Suddenly, the buffalo is stunned. The buffalo's back is being bitten by the crocodile! The buffalo squeals for help. Luckily, a mouse-deer comes along. The mouse-deer wants to see a re-enactment of events. So, the crocodile goes back to the first place. The crocodile is carried to the fallen tree. The fallen tree is placed on</page><page sequence="13">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 123 top of the crocodile's body again. The crocodile complains about bear- ing this burden. Mouse-deer lets the crocodile be squashed by the fallen tree. The water buffalo is allowed to witness it. The buffalo is not allowed to help again. Mouse-deer points to the crocodile. That is the result of the scheming crocodile's deeds. The crocodile who doesn't know how to return a favor (Surasdi 1985b). In this story, Kancil uses his wits to come to the rescue of another animal without benefit to himself. Shedding his involvement with the battle for survival entirely, and outside the fray, he becomes an au- thority figure. This is in contrast to the traditional Kancil stories, in which Kancil often betrays other animals even when they pose no threat to him, such as the other herbivores he tricks into the bottom of the pit. Even in stories where he is morally neutral, and simply caught up in the never-ending struggle to survive, he is not portrayed as a victim, but as a powerful figure who can take on the tiger or crocodile as an equal. In many of the modern stories, in contrast, there is an explicit emphasis on Kancil's relative small size and inabil- ity to fight with larger animals, as well as his inherent peacefulness which must be trespassed upon by another animal before Kancil re- sorts to trickery to defend his property: The Fable of Kancil and Elephant At the edge of the forest the mouse-deer lives peacefully. Much food can be found there. One day, Mouse-deer is disappointed because many plants are broken down. An elephant comes. Greedily the ele- phant eats the foliage. The mouse-deer gets mad at the elephant but a mouse-deer isn't able to fight with an elephant. An idea comes to him. Mouse-deer wants to trap the elephant. Mouse-deer finds an old well. This well is big enough to hold an elephant. Mouse-deer goes down to the bottom of the well. Mouse-deer waits for Elephant to pass by. When Elephant passes, Mouse-deer says that the sky is falling down. Elephant is afraid of getting struck down by the sky. Elephant wants to take shelter in the old well. Mouse-deer says that the elephant may come down into the well. When Elephant gets to the bottom of the well, Mouse-deer gets up on the back of the elephant. Mouse-deer leaps to the top. Now the elephant is trapped in the bottom of the well (Surasdi 1986a). Contrast this story with the more traditional version. Somehow, the modern story leaves one with the sense that the elephant was "asking for it," and that Kancil has shown admirable restraint in leaving him in the bottom of the pit to reconsider his behavior. In the modern</page><page sequence="14">124 WESTERN FOLKLORE stories, sneakiness is not automatically justified, even for survival. Characteristics that have taken on negative connotations are some- times attributed to the carnivore rather than the Kancil, and the sto- ries must contain an explicit justification for Kancil's tricks-either the tiger sneaks up behind him and tries to eat him, or the elephant "greedily" eats his leaves, or the crocodile takes advantage of buffalo's helpfulness. While the threat posed by these large animals could be assumed as basic shared cultural knowledge by traditional story tell- ers, the modern stories contain a moral charge that is lacking in the older, oral versions. For example, the tiger is termed "ruthless" be- cause he eats the flesh of other animals, and Kancil holds that against him. Both Kancil and the elephant eat the same leaves, but the ele- phant does so "greedily." Sneakiness, now being presented in a neg- ative light, is being attributed to the tiger, who "spies" on Kancil and sneaks up behind him. Increasingly, the offensive is being taken by the carnivore, and Kancil is merely seen as defending himself. Such changes in the perspective taken on certain behaviors allow many more subtle shifts in the connotative value or interpretation of Kancil's character. For example, Kancil remains explicitly male in the modern children's stories (clear because the illustrations usually show a mouse deer with tusks) but his sexuality has been neutralized. There is of course no mention of sexual union with a tiger, but even allusions to special sexual privileges, such as to possibility of marriage with the farmer's daughter, are gone in the modern stories. Similarly, while Kancil remains highly intelligent and quick-witted, the connotation has shifted from cunning to wisdom. Kancil's arrogance has become confidence and authoritativeness, so that he can confidently order the crocodile back under the fallen tree, and can make deals with the tiger. Kancil no longer brags about his special privileges and abilities, even though this results in fairly ad hoc plots, as when he asks to be allowed to wear his belt one last time before he is eaten. The Snake that was Taken for a Belt One day, Mouse-deer is overtaken with hunger. Mouse-deer goes to look for food. Mouse-deer finds a bayam (amaranth) plant. Mouse-deer eats the bayam leaves. Suddenly, Mouse-deer is startled. Beside him stands a tiger! The tiger roars. The tiger means to eat the mouse-deer! The mouse-deer is afraid of the tiger, however he quickly comes to his senses. Mouse-deer says that the tiger may eat him. The tiger is glad, because he gets this delicious food. Before Mouse-deer is eaten by the tiger, Mouse-deer wants to put on a belt. The tiger gets mad. Mouse-</page><page sequence="15">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 125 deer does not have permission to wear a belt. Mouse-deer shows Tiger his belt. Tiger can't wait to try on the belt. Tiger puts on the belt. It turns out that the belt is a snake! The poisonous snake bites the tiger. Mouse-deer is freed from danger (Surasdi 1986b). The traditional Kancil character was clearly adult, but there is some ambiguity as to who the child reader is supposed to identify with in the modern stories. At times, Kancil seems to be an adult authority figure the child is supposed to obey, but other times he seems to be a child with whom the child is supposed to identify. Thus, along with the desexualization of Kancil has come a concomitant juvenilization, as depicted in the last story of the Kancil series: The Fable of the Tiger and the Cat Tiger is the king of the jungle. Tiger is a ruthless animal. He likes to eat other animals. Mouse-deer doesn't like the tiger because the tiger likes to eat other animals. One day, Tiger spies on Mouse-deer. Mouse-deer is shocked to see tiger. His life is in danger. Mouse-deer doesn't lose his wits. He thinks hard how to escape. The tiger is disappointed because the mouse-deer is more vigilant. The mouse-deer approaches the tiger. Mouse-deer sets a condition. Tiger may eat the mouse-deer, as long as it is witnessed by the cat. Mouse-deer calls the cat. The cat comes right away. Tiger is shocked to see the cat. The tiger and the cat respect each other. Because the mouse-deer is a friend of the cat's, then the tiger doesn't want to eat the mouse-deer (Surasdi 1986c). In this story, Kancil's power has been all but coopted, and he is clearly meant to portray a model child. The lesson is, just as the good Kancil solves his problems by seeking human authority, so do good children resolve their disputes by seeking adult authority. This story then also clearly exemplifies a final structural difference between the traditional and the modern Kancil stories, which is that the modern stories are more likely to have an explicit moral. The roles and relationships of the characters within the stories have shifted subtly as well. Kancil was never incidental in the tradi- tional stories, but this has been magnified into a kind of omniscience. He 'just happens" to come along when the crocodile and the buffalo need someone to settle their dispute, for instance. The special, priv- ileged intermediary relationship Kancil traditionally had is manifest in interesting oppositions between wild animals (tiger, crocodile) and domestic animals (cat, buffalo) with in both cases Kancil acting as the intermediary who brings them together or resolves their dispute. However, so far, the stories still have to be about Kancil outsmarting</page><page sequence="16">126 WESTERN FOLKLORE a predator or other aggressor. It is interesting that Kancil has not been adopted as a general protagonist, but one never finds stories like "Kancil's family" or "Kancil goes to the beach." The only deviation from this formula, "Kancil de sekolah," still places primary focus on Kancil's intelligence, as the one important value that he personifies. A final difference is that the modern stories are more likely to have an explicit moral--crocodiles who don't know how to return a favor are punished, and tigers learn that seemingly helpless victims often have powerful allies. CONCLUSIONS The changes that have taken place can be understood in the con- text of the goals of each genre of story, and how they reflect changes in societal values. Both genres share the goal of entertainment, but both also have more subtle functions. In the case of the traditional folktales, they are exciting partly because of the vicarious excitement they provide the listeners, and thus may act as a kind of safety valve in a hierarchical society. The Kancil is a non-threatening but valuable character for a people who never dare to openly defy authority, and he provides an avenue for revenge fantasies for them. The modern children's stories, on the other hand, have the explicit goal of setting a good example. It will be interesting to monitor further changes in the image of Kancil as modern Indonesian life becomes increasingly urbanized and thus farther removed from the natural history of forest animals. Al- ready, it seems, the boundary between literature and nature is blurred. In the summer of 1989, a librarian in the public library in Malang, Eastern Java, firmly denied that the mouse deer existed at all, outside of the folktales. There is an inherent problem in relying on the attractiveness of a character such as Kancil, because it is largely his amorality that makes him attractive. There is a danger that in the process of bringing him in line with institutional values, he may lose all of the appeal that made him attractive in the first place. At present, the stories can still rely on the assumption that children are hearing the traditional sto- ries, so that the modern ones have the element of contrast, a dyna- mism accompanying a "reformed" Kancil. This is increasingly not the case, though, with urban Indonesian children, since already the sto- ries are told less frequently. Will the Kancil of children's story books</page><page sequence="17">FROM MISCHIEF TO MORAL EDUCATION 127 maintain his power and appeal when the more exciting traditional stories are no longer told? The "pancasilazation" of Kancil continues, and many questions can only be answered by waiting and watching over the next few years.
