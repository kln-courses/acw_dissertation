Duncan The ethological approach to assessing farm animal welfare is illustrated, by examples of three different methods. States of suffering such as frustration and fear can be recognized when the behavioural indicators are known. This approach has been successful with domestic fowl in that the husbandry conditions and procedures likely to lead to frustration and fear are now known , allowing steps to be taken to reduce them. Behaviour can be observed in an enriched environment in order to understand its function and development. This approach has been successful with pigs and has enabled a husbandry system to be designed which almost certainly safeguards welfare. Preference tests backed up by tests in which the strength of choice can be measured give some insight into what animals 'feel' about different aspects of their environment. However y there are problems associated with using a simple operant response to do this and some advancement in causation! motivation theory is required before the method will reach its true potential. Introduction Ever since the publication in 1964 of a book called 'Animal Machines' by Ruth Harrison,17 there has been much public disquiet about the welfare of farm animals kept under intensive husbandry systems. Coming in for particular criticism have been the battery cage system for laying hens, the tether-stall system for pregnant sows, the Danish system for fattening pigs and the individual crate system for veal calves. In the battery cage system of egg production the space allocated to the group of hens, the sloping floors, and the automation of all husbandry procedures such as feeding, watering, egg collecting and cleaning out all cause concern. Similarly for pigs, the Dr Duncan is in the Ethology Department of the AFRC Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research at its Edinburgh Research Station, Roslin, Midlothian EH25 9PS, Scotland. 317</page><page sequence="2">The welfare of farm animals restriction of the movement of sows by tethers in individual stalls, and of their diet to prevent them becoming too fat, are both questioned. So too is the Danish system of rearing pigs where groups are kept in bare, concrete pens from weaning until slaughter in controlled environment houses with low light levels. The keeping of calves in individual crates is in itself a source of disquiet, as is the avoidance of long fibre in either their food or bedding. Apart from these particular examples, the general trend in animal production has been towards large-scale production, automation and controlled environment housing. For example, chickens for meat production are commonly kept in groups of 10,000 or more, all the birds being of exactly the same age, and provided with light for 23 hours in a day. Although it is unusual, both beef and dairy cattle can be kept in very large groups of up to several hundred often with no access to grazing. Sheep are sometimes o ver- wintered indoors. Fur animals such as foxes and mink are being farmed in very artificial conditions similar to battery cages. The critics of intensive systems have tended to use anthropomorphic arguments along the lines, 'How would you like to live in these conditions?' These criticisms have been taken as threats to their livelihood by intensive farmers and producers who have used another false argument in reply, namely that since the systems are so productive, therefore welfare must be assured. The debate has thus been extremely emotional and has not been overloaded with factual evidence. However, some applied ethologists have attempted to obtain objective evidence about the welfare of the domestic farm animals concerned by studying their behaviour. Welfare and suffering In tackling animal welfare, the biggest problem is one of definition; what is meant by 'welfare'? In fact it is probably impossible to give it a precise scientific definition and a broad working definition would be one which encompassed the notions of 'the animal in physical and mental health', 'the animal in harmony with its environment', 'the ani- mal adapting without suffering' and it should also take account of 'the animal's feelings'. A loose working definition of 'suffering' is 'a wide range of unpleasant emotional states'. Another problem is the fact that welfare lies at the intersection of science and ethics. The manner in which, and the extent to which, we exploit animals involve ethical decisions which should be made by society in general. Scientists, including ethologists, can help society in making these decisions by providing scientific evidence on the facts. Thus they might show that if animals are kept under particular conditions then they will be frustrated at certain times of day or that specific husbandry procedures are liable to frighten animals. However, the ultimate decision is an ethical one and to date there has been little help available to society to cope with ethical decisions, although this may be changing.20 My personal opinion is that the topic is further complicated by aesthetic judgements. Thus partially de-feathered hens or cattle in feed-lots without access to 318</page><page sequence="3">Ian J. H. Duncan grass may offend some people's aesthetic sense no matter the welfare implications of such things. Assessing welfare It is generally agreed that in any assessment of welfare, all the available evidence should be taken into account. This will include evidence of the animals' health, production, physiology and biochemistry as well as behaviour. Unfortunately, these classes of evi- dence all have short-comings. Although disease and injury can be used as indicators of reduced welfare, their absence is not sufficient to prove well-being. The problem with the other indicators is one of calibration; how much of a change indicates reduced welfare? For these reasons, as many sources of corroborating evidence as possible should be sought. This paper deals with the ethological approach; the other classes of evidence are discussed elsewhere.7'23 The ethological approach States of suffering One of the ways in which behaviour can be used to assess welfare is by studying how animals behave in various states of suffering. For example, it was claimed by the 'Brambell Committee' (a group set up by the British Government to investigate inten- sive husbandry systems) that hens in battery cages will be frustrated because The nor- mal reproductive pattern of mating, hatching and rearing young is prevented and the only reproductive urge permitted is laying. They cannot fly, scratch, perch or walk freely. Preening is difficult and dust-bathing impossible'.5 Now this supposition can be, and has been, tested experimentally. Hens have been thwarted in many different ways while attempting to feed, behave sexually, nest, incubate eggs and brood chicks.11 A simple example of this type of experiment would be to train a hen to expect one big meal each day from a food dish. The behaviour of the hen could be observed when it was hungry and there was food present (it would spend most of its time feeding) and also when it was not hungry (it would spend time in other activities such as drinking, sleeping, exploring the immediate environment, etc.). On another day, the hen could be frustrated by covering the dish with a glass panel so that it could see the food but not obtain any and its behaviour observed. In all the experiments of this type that were done, it was found that if frustration is severe, i.e. if the tendency to perform the frus- trated response is strong, then hens show stereotyped back-and-forward pacing. When they first start, these back-and-forward movements appear to be attempts to escape from the frustrating situation and a tranquillizer which reduces fear prevents their occurrence. Once they are established, however, the tranquillizer has no effect, sug- gesting that at this stage they are motivated by something other than fear. On this sub- ject it is interesting that recent Dutch studies suggest that the performance of stereo- typed movements in tethered sows may stimulate the release of brain opioids. If this 319</page><page sequence="4">The welfare of farm animals is verified and shown to be a general property, then it would help explain one of the puzzles of stereotypies, namely why they appear to be addictive. If hens are subjected to mild frustration, they show an increase in preening. Since this preening occurs unexpectedly and is different from normal preening both in the duration of the motor patterns and in the plumage areas preened, it has been called 'displacement' preening, i.e. a behaviour pattern occurring out of context. If two or more hens are frustrated simultaneously then, in addition to the other responses, the dominant birds show an increase in aggression towards the subordinates. Although displacement preening is seen in battery cages, suggesting that mild frustration is fairly common under commercial conditions, the responses indicating severe frustration, with one exception, are not seen. The exception is that some birds of certain strains show stereotyped back-and-forward pacing and increased aggression during the pre- laying phase when they appear to be frustrated because they cannot find a suitable nest site. So caging does not frustrate hens in all the ways suggested by the Brambell Com- mittee, but does thwart the nesting behaviour of some birds, a possibility that they did not consider. Another state of suffering that has been widely investigated in domestic fowl is fear, which can be considered as a hypothetical state of the brain or neuro-endocrine system arising in response to perceived danger. The stimuli that lead to a state of fear and the responses, both behavioural and physiological, made by the bird are now fairly well understood and this knowledge is being used to assess various husbandry procedures. 12v 13 This approach, of stressing animals experimentally, observing how they respond and comparing these responses with what happens in commercial practice, has been ex- tremely useful in assessing the welfare of domestic fowl. Of course, it leaves unans- wered the question 'Are animals which are frustrated or frightened actually suffering?' In fact there is some evidence that severe frustration is aversive in fowls. Apart from that, the results enable more definitive statements to be made about whether or not fowl are frustrated or frightened in commercial conditions (in contrast to the Brambell Committee which only supposed that they would be). But perhaps more importantly, they lay the foundation for the next step which is to investigate how birds feel about being frustrated or frightened. This next step will be discussed later. Unfortunately, this method has not been used with other farm species. It also has the disadvantage that some states of suffering may be missed. Frustration and fear have been considered but what of 'loneliness' or 'boredom'? Can animals suffer from those and may there not be other states of suffering in animals, not experienced by human beings? Behavioural differences in different environments For these reasons and also because there is a view that welfare should be more than just the absence of states of suffering, other methods have been used to assess welfare. One of these has been to look for differences in behaviour between an animal in an environment which is assumed to be ideal and the environment under investigation. There are several problems with this approach the biggest of which is in deciding what 320</page><page sequence="5">Ian J. H. Duncan is an 'ideal environment' for a domestic animal. The argument can, so easily, become circular. Thus an ideal environment' may be chosen on the basis that it elicits a rich variety of behaviour. It should hardly be surprising, therefore, that when compared to this, other environments will appear 'poorer' in that they elicit a more meagre reper- toire of behaviour. What is an ideal environment' for a domestic animal? It is almost certainly not the natural environment in which its wild progenitors evolved. All of our domestic farm species have been artificially selected for thousands of years for various traits which has resulted in them being substantially different from their ancestors. It could be argued that a 'traditional' husbandry system would be near ideal since, until the second half of this century, husbandry methods had evolved relatively slowly, which meant that the species involved could also evolve under natural and artificial selection pressures. It is only in the past 40 years that husbandry methods have changed by leaps and bounds allowing no time for biological evolution. In addition, production animals are now often kept under completely different conditions from the breeding stock from which they are derived and so the possibility of animals evolving to suit the system has generally been removed completely. However, 'traditional' systems often have obvious failings. For example, hill sheep in north-western Europe commonly suf- fer from malnutrition and exposure during severe winters to such an extent that many die. Another possibility is that feral populations of farm animals which are living and breeding in the wild may provide a reference for behaviour in an 'ideal environment'. However, the same criticisms can be raised as with animals under traditional systems. It is worth noting that the title of the classic study of Soay sheep on St Kilda by Jewel et al.19 is 'Island Survivors' and it is obvious in this account that these animals are often severely stressed and exposed to hardships and deprivations which undoubtedly reduce their welfare. Another problem associated with this so-called 'method' is in interpreting be- havioural differences that occur between environments. We should expect animals to behave differently in different environments and, as has been shown, there is no guarantee that behaviour seen in more 'natural' environments indicates an adequate level of welfare. A particular difficulty arises when a behaviour pattern is missing under intensive conditions. For example, wing-flapping does not occur in battery cages, and it might be concluded that caging prevents wing-flapping. Although it is true that a commercial cage is not large enough to allow expression of the full motor pattern, nevertheless there could be other explanations besides 'prevention'. For example, per- haps the battery cage does not have the specific stimuli (called 'releasers' by ethologists) to elicit wing-flapping or perhaps the caged bird is not motivated to wing-flap. Until we know what wing-flapping is, what causes it, what function it serves, how it develops and how it has evolved, we cannot say that caging prevents it. Another obvious example is that the lack of anti-predator responses in intensive systems does not necessarily indicate reduced welfare. Behavioural differences between systems may simply demonstrate how adaptable our domestic species are. Some independent check is 321</page><page sequence="6">The welfare of farm animals required before it can be concluded that these differences indicate reduced welfare. Finally, what of behaviour patterns that occur in intensive systems but in a vacuum, i.e. in the apparent absence of the external stimuli normally eliciting them? Sometimes the occurrence of vacuum activities seems to indicate a reduction in welfare. For exam- ple, sows which are kept in tether-stalls without access to straw show vacuum manipu- latory activities of the mouth and snout. When straw is provided these activities are directed towards it and their frequency is greatly reduced, suggesting that there is a negative feedback effect when the behaviour is directed at an appropriate stimulus. Moreover, in the absence of straw, the motor patterns often become extremely stereo- typed and exaggerated.14 On other occasions the occurrence of vacuum activities does not suggest reduced welfare. For example, some hens of certain strains show vacuum nest-building motor patterns in battery cages.28 These patterns occur at about the same frequency and in similar sequences whether or not nesting material is present, suggest- ing that feedback is unimportant. It looks as though these hens are pre-programmed to follow a set sequence of behaviour once it is triggered by internal factors.26 Another example of this type of pattern may be the rotating movements shown by many domestic dogs before settling down to sleep regardless of whether or not there is grass to flatten. Lastly, there are vacuum activities about which it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding welfare. For example, dust-bathing is uncommon in hens in cages but occasionally it is seen. Bouts tend to be less frequent and much shorter and frag- mented on wire floors compared to dust-bathing with dusty material present suggesting that, unlike nest-building, bouts are not completely pre-programmed but are influenced by the environment.25 Dusty material appears to provide positive feedback, at least in the early part of bouts. However, if vacuum dust-bathing was not sufficient or adequate to reduce the internal causal factors (whatever they might be), one would predict that birds in cages would repeatedly start to dust-bathe , and this does not happen . The whole topic of what causes behaviour and in particular the relative importance of internal causal factors and the role of performance of behaviour on subsequent motivation have been somewhat neglected by ethologists in recent years. This is to be regretted since there are many problems in the field of applied ethology (such as the interpretation of vacuum activities) the solution of which require some advancement in causation/motivation theory. Understanding the function and development of behaviour There is one way in which studies of domestic species in more extensive conditions can be invaluable and this is in helping the understanding of the function and develop- ment of certain behaviour patterns which may be otherwise obscure. For example, Stolba and Wood-Gush studied the function and development of the behaviour of a small population of pigs living with minimal interference on a partially wooded hillside in Scotland.24 They identified certain key features in the environment which consis- tently guided the performance of frequent or regular sequences of behaviour by pro- viding releasing, orienting or situational stimuli. The next stage in the study was to 322</page><page sequence="7">Ian J. H. Duncan assess whether the patterning and orienting of the sequences would change, first, if the area was made smaller and, second, if certain of the key features were removed. This allowed the relative importance of space and environmental richness to be assessed. In a similar way, key items in the social environment were identified. A housing system was then gradually developed which required neither a large area nor expensive build- ings and which incorporated the essential key features as defined areas with appropriate furniture. The basic unit of the system was a series of interconnecting pens to take four sows and their followers. The pens were partially roofed and partially open to simulate a forest border where many activities took place on the hillside. Each sow was provided with a nest-site, sheltered against the wind but with a good view out of the pen through the front gate. Space was allowed for a nest 2-3 m in diameter and straw for building the nest was provided in a rack some distance away. The sequence of pulling straw from the rack, gathering it in the mouth, carrying it to the nest-site and depositing it with nodding movements was thus possible. Although the journeys were shorter and the nesting material more homogeneous than on the hillside, nevertheless the organization of this behaviour was almost identical and it was appropriately oriented. The same was true of nest building. A site was provided for defaecating 4.5-11 m away from the nest which was the distance walked by pigs on the hillside before defaecating after leaving the nest. There were also activity areas, suitable materials in which to root and wallow, sufficient space for all pigs to feed simultaneously and refuges for any pigs coming under social pressure. Using this method Stolba and Wood-Gush have managed to design a pig housing system which takes more account of the animals' behaviour. Although no absolute measure is available, there can be little doubt these pigs enjoy a high level of welfare; all the symptoms which are suggestive of reduced welfare are absent. For example, all types of stereotypies are absent, vices such as tail-biting and cannibalism are absent, aggression is at a low level, much more time is spent in manipulating and exploring objects than other pigs and fear responses are not exaggerated. In addition, and most importantly, the system is very promising commercially. It is disappointing that although there have been detailed studies on the behaviour of feral populations of fowls which have yielded useful information, to date it has not been possible to use this to design a commercially viable housing system for domestic fowl. Subjective feelings What we want to know ultimately when we ask whether or not animals are suffering is if they are having a particular type of unpleasant mental experience, if they are aware of what is happening to them, if they are capable of subjective feelings. It is possible that much of the behaviour that is suggestive of reduced welfare such as frustration reponses or fear responses could be reflexive with little or no associated mental experi- ence or awareness of what is going on. The question of animal cognitive processes has aroused much interest recently and there is general agreement that animals as phylo- genetically advanced as farm livestock have some sort of awareness.7'15'16'27 The prob- lem is, how much? Of course, subjective feelings are not directly accessible to scientific 323</page><page sequence="8">The welfare of farm animals investigation but we can gain a lot of information about them from indirect evidence. Moreover, in the welfare debate, even a very crude measure of feelings, such as how positive or negative they are, would be extremely helpful. The simplest method of gaining some indirect evidence is to allow animals to choose various aspects of their environment and assume that they will express at least some of their feelings in their actions and choose in the best interests of their welfare. These techniques have been developed for studying preferences in domestic fowl and have proved useful in providing a first estimate of what animals 'feel' about different aspects of their environment.6'18. However, there are problems in interpreting the results from such tests. For example, the results only give information about the relative properties of two environments and not their absolute values. In addition, minority choices are difficult to interpret; an animal which chooses to spend 10% of its time under one set of conditions may be making a positive choice which is as important for its welfare as the 90% choice. Finally, an animal's short-term preference may not be in the best interests of its long-term welfare. Dawkins has pointed out that a wild species in its natural environment will have proximate 'needs' which coincide with its ultimate 'needs',8 but that may not be true of a domestic species in an artificial environment. We should not expect animals to weigh up the long-term consequences of their de- cisions and make rational choices accordingly. The current status of preference tests in the assessment of animal welfare is considered in some detail by Dawkins.9 A development of the preference test is to measure how strongly motivated an ani- mal is to choose in a particular direction. Since the higher animals will learn to perform a response in order either to gain a reward or to avoid a punishment (a type of learning called operant conditioning), then it should be possible to ask animals what they find rewarding and what they find aversive. First experiments using operant conditioning techniques employed simple changes in the physical environment as rewards. Thus pigs were shown consistently to prefer light to darkness but were not prepared to 'work' very hard to switch lights on.2 Sheep and calves also preferred light to darkness but worked to obtain much less light in moti- vational tests than they chose in preference tests.3 Domestic fowl also had a clear pref- erence for light over dark and were prepared to work for a minimum of about 4 h light in a day.22 Later experiments have been asking more complicated questions. For example, van Rooijen measured the strength of the preference of pigs for earth floors compared to concrete floors by forcing them to make a larger number of responses in order to gain access to the earth.21 The aversiveness of certain procedures can also be measured by this technique. For example, when pigs were placed in a transport simu- lator which vibrated noisily, they learned to make a response which switched off the vibrator for 30 s. They worked harder when the vibrations were faster and when they had full stomachs. It was also found that it was the vibration and not the noise that was aversive to the pigs.1 This approach is certainly promising. With some ingenuity more complex situations might be investigated. We might be able to ask such questions as 'Will an animal work 324</page><page sequence="9">Ian J. H. Duncan in order to gain access to a particular social group?' or 'Will it work in order to gain access to a particular environment in which it can perform certain behaviour patterns?' or 'Will it work in order to avoid being frustrated in a certain way?' and as a bonus we can also ask 'How hard will it work?' Beilharz and Zeeb were so enthusiastic about this approach that they stated, 'If hens cannot be taught to peck a spot in order to be allowed to sand-bathe, or stretch the wings, we may conclude they have not great moti- vation to do these things'.4 But Dawkins and Beardsley warn that this may be very misleading.10 They were able to show that, given a free choice, hens which had been deprived of the opportunity to dust-bathe would choose to enter a chamber with litter in it and would dust-bathe there. However, the hens did not learn to perform a key- pecking response (which they learn very easily to obtain food) or a foot-treadle response in order to open the chamber door to gain access to the litter. Only when the response was altered to breaking a photobeam did the hens show that they found litter rewarding and then only after a large number of trials. Dawkins and Beardsley gave a number of reasons why an animal may not perform an operant response even though it may be highly motivated, such as the fact that the response may not be appropriate or the behaviour may not be conditionable. Since they could not eliminate all of these complications in their study, they concluded that there was still a possibility that dust- bathing motivation was strong, although their results suggested that it was only weak. However, another possibility is that dust-bathing is very stimulus bound and that when dust-bathing material is out of sight, it is also out of mind. In another experiment, Dawkins attempted to measure dust-bathing motivation by applying consumer demand theory.8 According to this theory, items are defined as 'necessities' if demand for them remains high when the price, or the effort required to obtain them, is raised. If demand falls when the price is raised, then the items are class- ified as 'luxuries'. When this was done, there was not evidence of hens regarding litter as a necessity either when they had to choose between food and litter under different degrees of food deprivation or when total time to perform various activities was reduced. When we wish to measure an animal's tendency to behave in a particular way in wel- fare studies, it would seem to be vitally important to use a variety of techniques. The measurement of motivation is an area in which applied ethologists urgently require guidance. For example, as pointed out by Dawkins, the concept of animals having 'ethological needs' has crept into the applied ethological literature and even into the welfare legislation of some countries, although the term itself has no solid foundation in scientific ethology.8 References 1.
