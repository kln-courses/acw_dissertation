<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS States and Illegal Practices. Edited byJosiAH McC. Heyman (Oxford: Berg, 1999. vii + 325 pp. £16.99) In both historical and contemporary forms, criminology and criminal justice have drawn upon, some would argue been parasitic upon, a range of disciplines. Two disciplines that have been relatively under utilized as a source of empirical, conceptual, and theoretical insight have been anthropology and history; this text indicates the potential value of exploring these disciplines far more seriously than is presently the case by those who wish to speak constructively about crime and criminal justice. States and Illegal Practices deserves a wide readership. Justice cannot be done here to the ten contributions that make up this book. Suffice to say that these chapters deal with a range of empirical objects, interrogated via (often provisional) conceptual and theoretical frameworks. Gallant charts the complex (and largely obscured) relationships between brigandage, piracy, capitalism, and state formation via a historical world systems perspective, arguing persuasively that 'bandits helped make states, and states made bandits' (p. 25). Nugent teases out the shifting dynamics of state and shadow state in early twentieth-century Peru, documenting the fluidity between legal and illegal political networks. The career—as rise and 'fall'—of the Burmese so-called 'opium lord' Khun Sa is described by McCoy within the complex interplay of shifting state interests and relationships in and between Burma, Thailand, China, and the USA. There is a far from standard treatment of the creation of, and fissures within, symbiotic relations between various forms of Italian mafia and (fractions of) Italian state. This treatment poses quite explicitly the problems of knowledge, not least in a Cold War context, and of the significance of exploiting moments of political flux in general, and political transparency in particular, in order to 'know' (Schneider and Schneider). Humphrey examines Russian protection rackets, analysing 'law and order' not simply as a commodity appropriated and then exchanged by private 'illegal' groups, but also—indeed, perhaps more significantly—as an idea, an attitude, a cultural category. Using the issue of fishing rights in the Gulf of California, Vasquez-Leon analyses the ways in which neo-liberal practice and rhetoric at an international level are translated into local contexts via nation-states, a translation in which both the production of illegality and the use of scientific rationales are key resources for certain bureaucratic and private interests. Sullivan and Miller revisit the processes associated with a moral panic, through a focus on adolescent violence in the US. Two contributions deserve particular mention. Heyman carefully utilizes an analogy with US military aggression in Vietnam to examine the nature of, and rationales for, the persistent tendency of successive US governments to resort to the inevitably ineffective escalation of (legal and illegal) state violence in efforts to control 'illegal' activity, focusing here on border policing and drugs. Alongside this latter chapter, the other tourdeforcehere is Smart's sole contribution, in which he seeks to develop a typology of the forms in which, and conditions under which, illegal networks and practices are able to persist across historical epochs and a variety of state and societal forms. Smart's piece is self-avowedly provisional, thought-provoking, and a lynchpin of the whole book. Through almost all the contributions run two interconnected strands, and strengths: namely, problematizations, and indeed sensitive and insightful treatments, of'state' and 'illegality'. While the 'state' has either been virtually organized off mainstream criminological agendas, or if it 'appears' is treated as an outdated concept, superseded by the need to identify a diverse and dispersed range of practices and techniques of government, the concept of the state is genuinely interrogated here, through a variety of empirical and analytical considerations. Thus states are 756</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS viewed 'from below' and 'from within' as much as 'from above' (p. 15), with a consistent avoidance of treating the state as an undifferentiated entity which 'acts' in some anthropomorphic fashion. The (related) understandings developed around 'illegality' via the notions of illegal networks and illegal practices should have some familiarity to criminologists, though much contemporary criminology seems to have returned to proceeding urithin state definitions of (il) legality rather than enquiring into the construction, maintenance, bases and forms of such definitions per se. Thus the introductory chapter promises to provide 'ethnography of illegal networks contextualized in arenas like pieces of the state, legal, and illegal positions in society as a whole and the ideology of the law' (p. 19). Indeed, this overview chapter by Heyman and Smart performs the task of knitting together what could appear too disparate contributions well, even though a more extended chapter would could have done this job even more effectively. As a text by anthropologists and historians, there are moments of weakness when contributions stray explicitly on to the terrain of other disciplines. Most notably, the chapter on moral panics really has litde more to offer than a standard criminological/sociological treatment. The consid erations of both Gramsci's concept of hegemony and Foucault's power-knowledge axis in the introduction are too truncated, despite their acting as key conceptual backcloths to many of the chapters. And some of the particular claims from political science and political economy seem to me to be either somewhat simplistic or simply wrong: for example, is it really accurate to charac terize the USA as a strong state when one is considering domestic political management simply because of its international 'superpower' status? But these are perhaps inevitable—and quite minor—consequences of cross-disciplinary fertilization, not to be taken as counselling against such efforts, and certainly not detracting significantly from what is an excellent edited collection.
