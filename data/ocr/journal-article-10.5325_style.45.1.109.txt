<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> William Nelles University of Massachusetts Dartmouth A Hypothetical Implied Author  While my own views on this topic are little changed from my exposition of them  in 1993, the focus of the debate has shifted considerably since then, and I welcome  the opportunity to offer a brief commentary on that energetic and surprisingly  durable critical discussion. The importance that the implied author model has had  for narrative theory is dramatically illustrated by a browse through the 515 items in  the bibliography of Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Müller’s thorough and authoritative  2006 study of the problem, The Implied Author: Concept and Controversy. They  put their finger neatly on the sensitive crux of the matter in their opening pages,  when in two consecutive sentences they identify two points of broad consensus:  that the traditional model of the implied author “is inappropriate and analytically  vacuous” (1) and that it is “one of the most successful concepts in the academic  study of literature in the twentieth century” (2). Few academics who have endured  the various controversies leading up to our current stage of post-post-structuralism  will deny out of hand that a theory may be both vacuous and successful, but for  me at least the objections to the implied author have missed their mark. Much of  the recent work in the field may be roughly surveyed, à la Julius Caesar’s Gaul, by  dividing it into three camps: those critics who maintain a version of Wayne Booth’s  original author-centered concept, including most prominently James Phelan; those  who favor a strictly text-centered approach, chiefly inspired by the work of Ansgar  Nünning; and a “big-tent” group of moderates who would locate both of those  positions within the pale, represented by Seymour Chatman.1 Somewhat surprisingly, Chatman’s moderate view has become the preferred  target for attacks on the model (it’s not always good to be the big dog). The charges  range from Nilli Diengott’s matter-of-fact “Chatman is wrong” (“Implied” 73), to  Kindt and Müller’s “he does not have a clear picture of how it is to be understood”  (104), to Nünning’s dire verdict that “Here one sees clearly revealed the hopelessness  and uselessness of a concept” (“Deconstructing” 102). Most of the trouble results  from Chatman’s refusal to be dogmatic about the precise details of how one  imagines the implied author: “My defense is strictly pragmatic, not ontological:  Style: Volume 45, No. 1, Spring 2011 109 </page> <page sequence="2"> 110 William Nelles the question is not whether the implied author exists but what we get from positing  such a concept” (75). Thus he is equally open to thinking of the implied author  as the invention-based “source” of meaning (74), as a reception-based “inferred”  author (77), or even as “nothing other than the text itself” (86). According to my  reading, at least, virtually every objection to Chatman’s definition results either  from seizing upon one thread or another of this three-strand braid and proceeding  as though it were the only thread, or from seizing the braid and claiming it to be  a single confused thread. Phelan, for example, includes him among theorists who  deny the role of human agents and intentionality and seek to make the implied  author “solely a textual function” (Living 44-45). But Chatman stipulates that he  “does not deny the existence of important connections between the text’s and the  real author’s views,” rejecting only “the simplistic assumption” “that the reader  has direct access through the fictional text to the real author’s intentions and  ideology” (76). He explicitly advocates recourse to the views of the real author in  interpretation: “Recognizing the logical distinction between real author, implied  author, and narrator sensitizes us to interpretational prospects that we might miss,”  specifically including cases “where the implied ideology of the text is consonant  [or dissonant, one might add]. . .with that of the real author” (87).  Nünning, on the other hand, takes the entire braid in hand and pronounces it a  failed attempt at producing a single thread that “is at best descriptively inadequate  and at worst contradictory and grossly misleading” (“Deconstructing” 97-98). But  there is no logical contradiction here, as there would be if Chatman insisted in turn  that each of the three approaches was the only true path; he claims rather that these  three emphases are complementary and all potentially adequate to the needs of literary  interpretation. As David Darby has argued in his own analysis of the implied author,  the “true justification” of narratology’s “tools” “lies in their application, that is, in  the work that can be done with them, not in any intrinsic quality of purity they may  be said to possess. Indeed, the purity of tools, insofar as the notion is meaningful, is  demonstrably inversely proportionate to their functionality” (431). A knife with three  blades is not automatically “nebulous,” “vague,” and “critically useless” (Nünning  98); I would describe it instead as versatile. One might also object in passing that  Nünning’s own proposal, which calls upon readers to interpret novels by abstracting  from them “the sum of all formal relationships, all the superordinate structures  which can be variously construed” (which might be paraphrased as “everything  you can think of”), is no more an “exactly definable” paradigm of “conceptual  precision” (112) than is Chatman’s, despite frequent assertions to the contrary.  The very same shoe turns out to fit the other foot quite well, as demonstrated by  </page> <page sequence="3"> A Hypothetical Implied Author 111 Kindt and Müller’s dismissal of Nünning’s model as “potentially contradictory,”  “unmanageable,” and “of dubious usefulness” because of its “vagueness” (113). Given Nünning’s unequivocal rejection of the implied author, one would  expect that his objections to Chatman’s model, which seems clearly designed to  accommodate the “structural whole” view he prefers, would apply, a fortiori, to  Phelan’s far stricter definition, which directly designates “the implied author as  the agent who is the source of the narrative” (Living 47). But, in his later work,  Nünning favors a “synthesis of the two approaches,” arguing that “the rhetorical  approach with its emphasis on the recursive relations among (implied) author, textual  phenomena or signals, and reader response encompasses the cognitive narratologist’s  emphasis just on reader and text” (“Reconceptualizing” 104). With this compromise  he would seem to have come around to a more inclusive model not far removed  from Chatman’s. Phelan’s implied author, though evidently palatable for Nünning,  would still differ sharply from Chatman’s in his stipulation that the “implied author  moves outside the text” in his model (Living 47). But the (excellent) reading of The  Remains of the Day that illustrates the utility of this approach requires no resort  to any elements of the implied author that come from outside the text, and every  reference he makes to Ishiguro is to a textually-embodied implied author. Booth,  one of the few participants in this debate to assess the intentions of a real author  in a sustained interpretation, notes that Henry James’s voluminous and detailed  written commentaries about his intentions in writing The Wings of the Dove reveal  no insights into, or even authorial interest in “the construction of meanings or anti- meanings, whether metaphysical, psychological, political, religious, or ethical; nor.  . .about clever play with chronology and point of view. . .” (“Ethics” 108). To claim  with Phelan that the implied author’s myriad intentions in a novel — which always  include all such meanings and concerns — are a “subset” of this nearly empty set  of the real author’s intentions rather than vice versa seems a stretch. But these are matters of relative emphasis within broad agreement: like Phelan,  I posit an implied author who is an image of the historical author, and would part  company with Chatman when he emphasizes the need to “resist the anthropomorphic  trap” (88), one of the most frequently encountered arguments for preferring a text- centered model that “avoids any implications of anthropomorphization” (Nünning,  “Deconstructing” 112). The simple fact that these narratives are all written by human  beings in human languages for human consumption and analysis suffices (for me)  to render such concerns absurd — what possible interpretive payoff could there  be to reading these productions as though they may have been written by aliens  or trees rather than by humans? Different critics will anthropomorphize writers to  </page> <page sequence="4"> 112 William Nelles varying degrees, of course. Many critics will attribute gender to implied authors  (several examples are provided in my earlier essay), and the frequent designation  of certain stylistic features as “late Henry James” and such seems to propose  something like an age for the implied author. One might hazard that some readers  would even postulate the eye color (as being not the bluest) for the implied author  of a Toni Morrison novel. Nünning asserts that one cannot “hold on to the concept  without at the same time falling into the [anthropomorphic] trap and becoming  entangled in unresolvable definitional contradictions” (98). But until the great day  when we finally do get to analyze that long-awaited novel written by a roomful of  monkeys, even the weakest of us is probably safe in assuming that all novels were  written by humans. He avoids the trap himself only through blank labels (“absent  cause”), impersonal constructions (“relations create a virtual structure”; but doesn’t  this threaten to anthropomorphize “relations”?), and passives (structure “is created  through the relationships between the constituent parts”), but most frequently by  the substitution of the reader’s agency for that of the author (“the reader constructs  relationships” [111]). Nünning’s extraordinarily competent reader, by the way,  who is able unproblematically to encompass “the sum of all the structural contrast  and correspondence relations” between all textual elements at all levels (111) in  a model in which “all elements of a text can potentially be juxtaposed” (114), is  arguably nothing other than the implied reader (another concept whose usefulness  he denies). As I have argued elsewhere, delegating the functions of the implied  author to a version of the implied reader is one of the most common sleight of hand  methods of making the implied author disappear (40-42).2  Quite apart from these matters of relative precision and fitness in definitions, an  additional objection is raised to the implied author’s potential for limiting multiple  interpretations. The issue is often posed as a classic Scylla and Charybdis dilemma:  accepting the premise of the implied author entails a belief that there can be one,  and only one, way to read a novel (the implied reader’s reading), and rejecting  that premise entails a belief that there are as many acceptable interpretations  as there are readers. Nünning, for example, argues that “the use of the definite  article and the singular [for] the implied author suggest that there is only ‘one’  correct interpretation” (“Deconstructing” 109). But literal insistence upon a single  acceptable interpretation is not part of anyone’s implied author model: as Booth  protests, “does anyone really wear those chains?” (Critical 276-77). Phelan’s  collaborative analysis of the implied author in The Remains of the Day, to cite  a well-known example, outlines two persuasive interpretations for the climax of  the novel (Living 59). Such readings are not unusual, and a long list of canonical  </page> <page sequence="5"> A Hypothetical Implied Author 113 examples of ambiguous texts — doubtless beginning with The Turn of the Screw  — could readily be assembled.3 Even strict views of intentionalism allow for such  multiple readings of a given text, if only by means of the argument that “equal  textual support for each of two opposing interpretations shows not that they are both  acceptable but that a third interpretation of the work as ambiguous or indeterminate  on the matter in question is always preferable” (Goldman 14). Nor is it necessary to  believe that every novel is a unified whole that can be encompassed in a coherent  interpretation. David Novitz emphasizes that “It is important to understand what  exactly the singularity constraint commits us to. . .. we do not commit ourselves to  the view that cultural objects cannot be vague, confused, nonsensical, ambiguous,  or else indeterminate in their meaning or their properties” (116; having just finished  reading The Mysteries of Udolpho, I can only add an “amen”). Furthermore, just  as a text may have a limited or inconsistent implied author (Phelan, Living 47),  not every real (and limited) reader can effectively construct the implied author of  (become the implied reader of) every text: Paradise Lost demands an implied reader  that I cannot become. As Martha Nussbaum argues, “Literary works are not neutral  instruments for the investigation of all conceptions. Built into the very structure of  a novel is a certain conception of what matters” (26). My inability to agree with  Milton about what matters, it seems obvious to me, prevents my reading him in a  sympathetic (ethical) manner.  At the other extreme, of course, resides the complementary straw man  who endorses every new reading as equally valuable and dismisses the implied  author’s intention and the demand for textual support as criteria for evaluating  readings. Umberto Eco characterizes this split as “the difference between. . .sane  interpretation and paranoiac interpretation” (48), but there is no shortage of theorists  who unreservedly advocate the paranoiac end of the scale. Jonathan Culler, for  example, asserts, “interpretation is interesting only when it is extreme. Moderate  interpretation. . .is of little interest” (110). Stefan Collini, having chided Culler for  invoking such a “thinly adolescent notion of what counts as ‘interesting,’” considers  the “fashion-conscious market of American academic life” that seems to demand  such artificial immaturity from criticism: “An essential condition of launching a  successful and high-profile academic career is the promotion of some striking  novelty. . .. Novelty, at least apparent novelty, of method and provocativeness of  formulation are, therefore, at a premium” (20).4 This analysis may not be accurate  — my own time spent with the MLA bibliography convinces me that most published  criticism is not so sedulously devoted to the cutting edge of the trendy — but there  can be little doubt that most graduate students and many junior faculty believe it.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 114 William Nelles My sense of the anecdotal evidence is that far more of them practice these theories  than believe in them — they simply feel forced to behave as though they did in  order to get published and tenured.  The chasm dividing these opposing views on critical pluralism is often widened  further by assigning the labels “formalist” and “contextualist” to the two camps  (but see Darby for an argument that the “theorization of the implied author” has  actually facilitated the bridging of this gap [428]). The model that I would advocate  here, “Hypothetical Intentionalism,” has been rarely discussed by narratologists  (though its inclusion in the closing pages of Kindt and Müller is promising), but  has come to be one of the preferred frameworks for discussions by our colleagues  in philosophy and art. The utility of this approach lies in its explicit admission  of contextual evidence to supplement textual evidence, combined with a careful  delimitation of those contexts relevant for interpretation. Jerrold Levinson, one of  the theory’s leading exponents, explains that literary meaning “will be a function of  and constrained by. . .the potentialities of the text per se together with the generative  matrix provided by its issuing forth from individual A, with public persona B, at  time C, against cultural background D, in light of predecessors E, in the shadow  of contemporary events F, in relation to the remainder of A’s artistic oeuvre G,  and so on” (Pleasures 184). The acceptable context, in a nutshell, is limited to  what the informed or competent contemporary reader of the work could know,  and the implied author would necessarily be one that could plausibly be imagined  by that ideal but possible reader 5.  In practice, most formalists have always taken  into account such extratextual evidence, and I expect that few implied author  advocates would have much difficulty in signing on to this much of the hypothetical  intentionalists’ program. Only those intentions that would be reasonably attributed  to that historical author by that (hypothetical) historical reader on the basis of that  work in its original context are relevant for interpretation. This does not mean that  interpretation is reduced to a least common denominator approach in which the most  pedestrian readings are the best. Gregory Currie makes the point that “In art we  aim for interpretations that are not merely coherent but which maximize whatever  we think the relevant artistic values are” (298); an interpretation that makes the  work better is superior to one that makes it worse. Levinson argues that “if we can,  in a given case, make the author out to have created a cleverer or more striking or  more imaginative piece, without violating the image of his work as an artist. . .we  should perhaps do so. That then is our best projection of intent. . .as informed and  sympathetic readers” (“Intention” 225). Implied author theory might have something  to offer hypothetical intentionalism in return. Levinson’s complaint that “we have  </page> <page sequence="7"> A Hypothetical Implied Author 115 no logical notion handy for representing the ensemble of acceptable interpretations  taken together” (“Hypothetical” 310) might well be answered by the concept of  the implied reader, whose interpretation would be precisely the comprehensive set  of these optimal interpretations.  Such a model of the implied author, as supplemented by the principles of  hypothetical intentionalism, would doubtless limit the range of readings that count  as “interesting” (though by very different criteria than Culler offered). As Currie  describes this position, “however relative the notion of goodness in interpretation  may be, it is still a genuinely normative idea, to be seen as answerable to constraints  that are not merely those of preference or power” (294). This advocacy of a limited  pluralism in interpretation, however diligently narrative theorists have swept it  under the rug, is an integral part of Booth’s concept of the implied author. Indeed,  one finds the problem couched in what seem prescient terms by fellow Chicago  critic R. S. Crane as early as 1952, when he insists on the “great difference  between ‘pluralism’ and merely amiable tolerance of half-truths, bad reasonings,  and preposterous interpretations” (v).6 I close with two formulations of the many  that Booth gave to this issue: “If, a hundred years from now, there is any sensitive  historian of ideas still practicing, nothing about us will seem more absurd than our  repeated undervaluing, with our reading-against, of what great authors do as they  create their works” (“Ethics” 131);7 “What is more, we are threatened by. . .the  conviction now growing among our students that criticism is at best the reduction of  the work to my own size and at worst simply the flinging of Greek-fed, polysyllabic  bullshit” (Critical 277). Notes 1  Kindt and Müller list a combined 32 publications on the implied author by  these three critics, whose positions have developed over time and are of course  more nuanced than these broad strokes can accurately represent. I focus on the  works most frequently cited by the major participants in the debates. 2  Compared to the rigor with which theorists parse the finer points of the  implied author and intentionalism, discussions of the implied reader by those  same critics are often much more loosey-goosey. Phelan’s characterization of the  task of becoming the authorial audience, for example, strikes me as downright  Chatmanesque: “I collapse the distinction between subject and object, intrinsic  and extrinsic. The text is in the reader and the reader is in the text like the fish is  in the sea and the sea is in the fish” (“Present” 232). </page> <page sequence="8"> 116 William Nelles 3  The “double” reading of Turn of the Screw was of course a particular pet  peeve of Booth’s, who rejected it firmly in The Rhetoric of Fiction (311-16, 364-71)  and even more firmly in Critical Understanding (284-301), arguing that no implied  author could have intended such a difficult and ambiguous work.  4  As Collini notes, postmodern criticism has shown little interest in expanding  the traditional canon in the course of this quest for novelty. Rather than demonstrating  the merits of new voices and texts, or even doing the work of editing those texts  and making them available to a larger audience, they seem obsessively focused  on conducting Gitmo-style “interrogations” of (usually innocent) canonical works  from the very middle of the mainstream.  5  Within this discussion critics distinguish between hypothetical and actual  intentionalism, the key difference being the latter’s privileging of all evidence of the  historical author’s intentions even in cases in which it could not have been known  to a contemporary reader. For me, these authorial remarks should be evaluated on a  case-by-case basis. When Eudora Welty assures us that Phoenix Jackson’s grandson  is not dead, her claim overrides the very scanty textual evidence that led to that  reading; on the other hand, when Faulkner discusses the construction of his novels  in terms of designing a chicken coop, I take it with a grain of salt. 6  Tom McAlindon offers a similar analysis of the critical climate a half- century after Crane: “Liberal tolerance in relation to oppositional views, respect  for innovation, misplaced regard for the political idealism of radical theory and  practice, and professional prudence have too often combined to allow parodies  of rigorous scholarship to pass as the real thing” (vii). He includes a 45-source  bibliography of works exposing the dishonesty and intellectual bankruptcy of critical  theory, with a focus on New Historicism. Anyone teaching critical theory without  including a fair representation of the widespread opposition to those theories is  not doing his or her job. 7  Feminist theory’s treatment of Jane Austen is perhaps the most widely criticized  example of (picking up Booth’s thread again) “half-baked critics, schooled in critical  dogmas and unschooled in how to reconstruct the vast created edifices built by the  great.” Those generally receptive to criticism of feminist theory will find Julia Prewitt  Brown’s essay on the feminist depreciation of Austen convincing (“we can only be  grateful that Jane Austen’s place in history is not dependent on the narrow approach  of feminists writing today” [313]), while those resistant to such criticism will find  Robyn Warhol’s dismissal of Brown’s position just as convincing (“What could be  more narrow. . .than a call for revising reading strategies that limits the available  possibilities. . .?“ [5]). Diengott, working from a more specifically narratological  point of view, characterizes feminist criticism of Austen as “decontextualizing,  </page> <page sequence="9"> A Hypothetical Implied Author 117 impressionistic writing that adheres to logic only when the critic feels like it”  (“Neo-Impressionism” 46).
