<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN MEMORIAM FELIX SPEISER By Leonhard Adam Through the death of Dr. Felix Speiser, Professor of Ethnology in the University, and Director of the Ethnographical Museum, of Basle, Switzerland, on September 19, 1949, the anthropology of Oceania has suffered a severe loss. Felix Speiser-Merian was born in Basle on October 20, 1880. He was educated at the universities of Neuenburg (Switzerland), Goettingen (Germany) and Basle, where his original subject was chemistry. Having taken out his degree as Doctor of Chemistry at Basle in 1904, he first joined a Swiss firm, Messrs. J. R. Geigy, who sent him to New York. However, from his early days onwards, he had developed a keen interest in anthropology and especially in ethnography, which was not surprising in a native of Basle, the famous old city with its magnificent ethnographical museum associated with the names of Fritz and Paul Sarasin, L. Ruetimeyer and other distinguished anthropologists and archaeologists. In America, this interest became so strong that Dr. Speiser decided to discontinue his industrial career to take up ethnology as a profession (1906). He visited the Hopi Indians where he •did some research work - his first experience in the field - and then returned to Europe where he studied physical anthropology and ethnography under Felix von Luschan at the University and Ethnographical Museum of Berlin. Luschan's seminar was one of the academic centres of anthropological and ethnological studies in those days, and a large number of distinguished anthropologists were either trained there or were otherwise associated with the department. In 1910, Felix Speiser went to the New Hebrides where, for a year and a half, he carried out his well-known field work. In 1914, he began his academic career as lecturer in ethnology in the University of Basle. Three years later he was already appointed professor extra- ordinarius. In addition to his brilliant gift of observation - which accounts for the excellence of his field work - Dr. Speiser always took a keen interest in com- parative investigations as a prerequisite for historical studies. He felt that, for his type of research, the knowledge of at least two widely distant areas was desirable. Thus when Theodor Koch-Gruenberg (1872-1924) suggested to him an expedition to the Aparai Indians in the south-eastern Guianas, Speiser at once accepted the idea. It is a tragic coincidence that he went on that expedition about the same time when Koch-Gruenberg met his premature death on his last journey to north- west Brazil (1924). The results of Speiser's field work in South America are recorded in his book Im Düster des brasilianischen Urw aides (Stuttgart, 1926) which is recog- nized as one óf the few " modern systematic accounts dealing with single tribes of the Guianas."1 In 1929 Speiser returned to his old research area in the Pacific, this time concentrating on three different localities, Bougainville, New Britain and the Sepik valley. The observations collected on that last expedition largely provided the material and inspiration for Speiser's literary work during the last twenty years, especially his theories laid down in the " Siedlungsgeschichte." In 1942 he succeeded Dr. Fritz Sarasin as chairman of the Council of the Basle Museum, of which he had been a member since 1914. The character of Speiser's work can be seen from the titles of his publications. He was principally interested in the genetics of the Pacific cultures, and his approach 1 John Gillin in Handbook of South American Indians, Vol. Ill, 1948, p. 819.</page><page sequence="2">OBITUARY 67 may be described as historical. But he was not a one-sided diffusionist as he repeatedly emphasized the importance of evolution and the obvious fact that certain simpler inventions must have been made several times independently in widely distant areas. Speiser criticized the " fascinating " culture-circle theory with the warning not to accept the hypothetical cultural strata and " circles " as real facts. He doubted whether whole cultures or single cultural elements, after travelling over great distances, would ever be taken over by another people without any alterations. Although he never wrote a formal textbook, actually his guide book to the museum in Basle2 can be described as a short introduction to cultural anthropology. In addition, in the preface to his last work, an outline history of human settlement in the South Seas,3 he set out some of his general principles illustrated by examples from Oceania. However, Professor Speiser was aware that our factual knowledge of Oceanian ethnography is still incomplete and thus he described his treatise as a mere essay, stressing the need of more specialized research work. Like the late F. E. Williams, he was intrigued by the problem " whether apparent complexes of elements can be proved to really exist, viz., in the sense of the composing elements being linked together in such a way that elimination of one element would disturb an organic balance and was bound to bring about the disruption of the whole complex. Not infrequently one is inclined to doubt the existence in the South Seas of any such solid complexes . . . "4 Apart from this special problem, however, Speiser assumes that " the culture of every healthy people forms a functional unit which either repels or absorbs or transforms alien cultural elements, whereby elements of a people's own old culture may become superfluous and, therefore, disappear."5 Speiser compared " the interference of (cultural) elements " to a kaleidoscope. He thought that perhaps it might be possible some day " to recognize laws according to which culture complexes form and disintegrate again - for, naturally, there must be laws for that/1 This hypothesis is explained as follows : while opportunities of importing foreign cultural traits may come about incidentally, the way a people reacts upon these opportunities will depend, on the one hand, upon the nature of the object, institution, or method in question and, on the other hand, upon their ability to adopt it, either as it is or in a modified form. While the first belongs to the accidental factors - at any rate for our present problem - the latter is, according to Speiser governed by laws. For example : " We can say with safety that without any external influence a people will never give up a cultural element but it will also never voluntarily accept an alien element which it cannot organically incorporate in its culture (e.g. Christianity)."6 Although this theory is not entirely original it is certainly stimulating ; for instance, it would be interesting to check it up with the results of H. I. Hogbin's recent researches in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. One of Speiser 's major contributions to anthropology is his exposition of the whole complex of cultural problems connected with the history of ethnic movements in the Pacific. The " Versuch einer Siedlungsgeschichte der Suedsee " has three sections. The introductory part consists of (a) general observations and method ; (b) physical anthropology ; and (c) languages. Then follows the main section (II), which deals with the cultures and is subdivided as follows : (A) Pre-Austronesian cultures (Tasmanian, Australian, pre-Austronesian, " quadrangular axe culture," and " people of small stature "). These " people of small stature " - Speiser rejects the term * Einfuehrung in das Museum fuer Voelkerkunde, Basel, Basle, 1939. 8 " Versuch einer Siedlungsgeschichte der Suedsee," 1946. 4 " Versuch einer Siedlungsgeschichte," p. 2, 1946. *Ibid., p. 3. • " Versuch einer Siedlungsgeschichte," p. 3.</page><page sequence="3">68 OBITUARY " Pygmies " or " Pygmoids " (ibid., p. io) - are not classified as a separate race ; nor are they credited with a culture of their own : " There is not one single cultural element which could be regarded as specifically peculiar to the people of small stature." " Their culture is composed of elements borrowed from neighbouring peoples." This includes two Tasmanian elements, the string bag and the custom of cremation (p. 32). Thus Speiser does not identify the Tasmanians with the " people of small stature " ; but he accepts the old theory that one branch of the Tasmanians might be identical with the Baining. Section II (B) includes the " Austronesian cultures " (1. Proto-Austronesian ; 2. Austro-melanoid). Within the " Austro- melanoid cultures," Speiser distinguishes between (a) elements which reached Polynesia, and (b) elements which did not. Section II (C) is occupied by the " Micro- nesian-Polynesian cultures " whereby Speiser distinguishes between (1) elements which reached Polynesia directly ; (2) elements occurring in the eastern Melanesian islands ; (3) elements represented in Micronesia and Melanesia only ; (4) the proto-Polynesian culture. Lastly, Section II (D) covers " the recent Indonesian elements," subdivided into (1) those which reached Micronesia, and (2) those which reached Melanesia. The distribution of all these various groups of elements is illustrated by a series of maps. Having thus examined the distribution of cultures and, implicitly, the routes pre- sumably taken by the various peoples of the South Seas, Speiser eventually presents, in Section III, his outline of the historical sequence of human migrations in Oceania in the order indicated by the arrangement of Section II. The wanderings of the Polynesians within Polynesia are not included as they have been thoroughly investi- gated by others. One of Speiser's conclusions, whereby he finds himself in agreement with Hocart, is that there is no Melanesian race in the sense of customary terminology ; nor can we speak of Melanesian culture. Only the languages are Melanesian but they show a pre- Austronesian and an Indonesian component. The pre- Austronesian group includes the Papuan, Tasmanian and Australian languages and also possibly other languages which might be recognized as belonging to this group in the future (pp. 12 and 79). However, Speiser's linguistic observations are only a compilation of the theories of Ray, W. Schmidt, Kanski and Kasprusch and, like the paragraphs on physical anthropology (pp. 4 ff.), appear as merely the framework for the principal, cultural-anthropological investigation. The results are summarized in Section IV, entitled " Die neue Nomenklatur " (pp. j8 ff.), wherein Speiser proposes a new terminology for the anthropology of Oceania, more particularly for (a) physical anthropology, (b) linguistics (no alterations are proposed here), (c) ethnology, and (d) geography. The main suggestion under (a) is to replace the term " Melanesians " by " Melanoids " (Melanide). The new term, however, would be much wider than the old one; Speiser suggests five subdivisions (p. 79), namely : (1) the Tasmanians, (2) the Baining, (3) the Bukaoids (Bukaide) in the western Solomon Islands, (4) the Papuoids (Papuide), described as "the Jewish Melanoids"7 and supposed 7 The misleading adjective " Jewish " was first applied to the Papuans by Neuhauss (191 1) and, incidentally, had been used to describe the physiognomy of a certain individual of the Bakairi tribe by Karl von den Steinen over sixty years ago. Speiser (p. 5 f.) thought of " Melanoids with the large noses and protruding lips," pointing out that they got the big noses from their Australian ancestors. Although Speiser uses the word " Jewish " in this connection only in inverted commas it is not a good term anyway because, as Speiser's teacher, F. von Luschan used to say, it is actually descriptive of physiognomies typical of several Oriental peoples,, notably of western Asia, while, on the other hand, a large proportion of the Jewish people is of -different racial types.</page><page sequence="4">Felix Speiser October 20, 1880-September 19, 1949.</page><page sequence="5">OBITUARY 69 to be "a mixture of Australoids with Melanoids." (5) the " quadrangular axe people," " presumably pure Melanoids." In addition, the " Melanoids " may also include " other groups outside the range of the Melanesian languages " (p. 79). Both Australoids and " Melanoids " are distinguished by their dark skin, the difference being that the former have wavy hair, while that of the latter is woolly (p. 78). As the colour is essentially identical, it would appear that, logically, the " Australoids" should be regarded as a subdivision of the " Melanoids," but, fortunately, Speiser does not make this suggestion. In fact, the structure of the hair is more important than the shade of the skin ; also, any alteration of the term " Australian," or " Australoid " would only lead to confusion. Again, if a new word is needed to denote, apart from the aborigines of the Australian continent, all the dark-skinned races of the Pacific in terms of physical anthropology, then any reference to a geographical area is out of place and thus the word " Melanoids " instead of " Melanesians " is not without justification. On the other hand, Speiser himself advocates the retention of the word " Melanesian "asa linguistic term and has also no objection to its use as an ethnological term because "asa whole, the linguistic and cultural areas coincide." According to the proposed terminology, then, " Melanesians " would denote those Melanoids who speak Melanesian languages and are culturally strongly influenced from Indonesia (p. 79). But Speiser realizes that this could lead to confusion, therefore he suggests a new term for " Melanesians " also in the linguistic and ethnological sense, " Austro-Melanoids," which means " Melanoids speaking Austronesian languages." He also recommends discarding of the word " Papua " except in physical anthropology on the ground that many " Papuoids " speak a Melanesian language and many have Austronesian cultural goods (p. 80). All these and other terminological proposals made in the book will have to be considered by an anthropological congress. More important than Speiser's terminological suggestions is his survey of a very large number of cultural elements and their distribution in Indonesia, Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia respectively. His theories about the migrations of the various ethnic groups and the distribution of elements are based on this vast tabulated material. Out of many interesting - sometimes, of course, controversial - details only one can be mentioned here : Speiser makes a sharp distinction between stone tjuringas and wooden ones. Only the former he cans " churingas," while the wooden ones appear as " Schwirrholz " (bullroarer) (p. 16). 8 But the stone tjuringa and the wooden bullroarer are of Indonesian origin. Speiser tells us that stone tjuringas occur in Flores " and pre- sumably also elsewhere in Indonesia " and that they might represent an ancient Australian element which both the Australians and the " rectangular-axe people " could have brought with them on their journey. On the other hand, he thinks that the bullroarer must have been imported, not by the Australians but by the '" Austro-melanoids " and in association with circumcision. His suggestion that stone and wooden tjuringas may each have a different history is a valuable contri- bution.9 Strangely enough, Speiser thought that bullroarers did not occur in Polynesia (pp. 16 f., 48 f., 54) whereas actually it is quite a conspicuous feature in Maori culture.10 8 Speiser here overlooked the large category of wooden ritual boards, of all sizes, without perforation, with a variety of ritual functions but exclusive of use as bullroarers. 9 I should like to add that perhaps it would be helpful if, for further investigations, the -terminology would be strictly technological, that is to say, if we discarded the word tjuringa (tjurunga) in this sense altogether and instead spoke of " ritual stones " or " ritual slabs of stone " and, on the other hand, " ritual boards." 10 Compare Elsdon Best, The Maori (Wellington, 1924, repr. 1941), Vol. II, pp. 163 if. (illustrations p. 165). It is noteworthy that, according to Best, the purerehua was used " in olden times in a rain making rite," at least on the east coast. Among the Maori, then, the function of the bullroarer was the same as in the North American south-west (Hopi, Papago, etc.), in spite of the entirely different climates in both areas.</page><page sequence="6">70 OBITUARY Of particular interest are Speiser' s theories concerning the origins of art styles in Oceania set out in " Ueber Kunststile," 1936, in his guide booklet on art styles in the South Seas, 1941, and also in the " Siedlungsgeschichte " (pp. 44, 46, 66). Speiser states that Polynesian art is basically rectilinear and that curvilinear elements are derived from the principal art styles of New Guinea as we find them in modern times. In New Guinea, he distinguishes between three main styles, the korwar style (centre : western north coast and Trobriand islands) ; the curvilinear style (Indonesia, Sepik, Gulf of Papua, Trobriand islands) ; and the Tami style (Huon Gulf, Admiralty Islands). While the Tami style is not represented in either Micro- nesia or Polynesia, both the korwar and curvilinear styles are. The former is recognized by Speiser, firstly, in the Admiralty Islands, also in northern New Ireland the Solomon Islands, and Santa Cruz ; furthermore, not in Micronesia but in the Marquesas, Hawaii, Easter Island and New Zealand. The curvilinear style was imported into Polynesia by the " Austro-Melanoids " and can be distinguished, in the first place, in New Zealand and also in the Marquesas Islands. Speiser considers that this style reached New Zealand from the Trobriands. The Tami style " seems to be somehow influenced by the korwar style " ; one feature of the Tami style is the snake which occurs in devouring scenes. Three points are conspicuous : firstly, the fact that the Tami style is here represented as the only one which did not originate in Indonesia but is described as a Melanesian feature developed within the rather limited area between Astrolabe Bay, Dampier Strait and the Admiralty Islands ; secondly, that the other two styles are recognized side by side within the area of New Guinea, notably the Trobriand Islands, and also in both New Zealand and the Marquesas Islands, so that there is apparently no sharp regional demarcation. Lastly, we notice that there is no mention of what is generally called the style of the Massim area. The explanation is that, in terms of Speiser's scheme, the Massim style would be just a regional substyle of the curvilinear style. However, as Speiser quite rightly recognized also korwar elements in the art of the Trobriands (the very centre of the Massim style province) - notably the " curiously flattened oval faces " already noted by Raymond Firth,11 it is better to retain the term " Massim style " to denote that characteristic regional development, let alone that it deserves a name of its own on account of the ample use made of ebony and the attractive effect produced by the black wood contrasting with white pigment filling, and accentuating, the engraved curvilinear designs. Another regional substyle, according to Speiser, is characterized by human, or at any rate anthropomorphic, figures with either beaks instead of noses, or noses resembling beaks, or even noses and beaks combined. This style Speiser calls the beak style. Its centre is the lower Sepik area and the environment of the estuary, and Speiser thought that the beak style reached New Caledonia and Maleluka, though in degenerated forms. But the most interesting part of his theory is his bold hypothesis regarding the origin of this style : he thought it was derived from Indian representations of Ganesha, and he referred to transitional forms in Bali.12 Speiser assumed that the beak style reached Melanesia later than the korwar style because 11 Art and Life in New Guinea, p. 27. 12 Kunststile in der Suedsee, 1941, p. 25 ; " Versuch einer Siedlungsgeschichte," p. 66. This theory is supported by a certain variety of Sepik sculpture showing an abnormally long vertical nose resembling an elephant's trunk rather than a beak. But the theory is not so convincing regarding other types of long-nosed masks and faces of statues in the Sepik area which may be explained as the result of two factors, viz. firstly, a Papuan racial feature exaggerated by per- foration of the septum and, secondly, ornithomorphous representations of mythical beings. Although masks with conspicuous long noses are a circum-Pacific feature (Japan, N.W. America, Central America), each type may have a history of its own.</page><page sequence="7">OBITUARY 71 the latter is more widely distributed in the area. About the origin of the korwar style Speiser offers another interesting theory, namely, that it may be a degraded eastern reflection of Khmer art, so to speak a peasant form of it. He was under the impression that a typical Khmer head and a korwar were distinguished by the same fundamental form, in particular " the cubic shape of the head, the large quad- rangular jaws, the broad, low, straight mouth, and the hardly protruding nose/' and he thought that, on his long journey to Melanesia, " the serene Buddha was transformed into a dynamic demon."13 Surprising as this hypothesis may seem at first glance, I suggest we may accept it in a generalized form since obviously the essence of the theory is the derivation of the korwar style from the highly developed mediaeval religious sculpture of south-east Asia. Just as it is now almost a certainty that at least one part of West African sculpture can be ultimately traced back to prototypes in a high civilization (ancient Egypt), it is equally possible, or even probable, that a similar development took place in south-east Asia during the periods of expansion of, first, Brahmanism, then Buddhism, and eventually Hinduism again. This would mean that, like a certain proportion of Negro sculpture, certain forms of so-called primitive sculpture in Indonesia, New Guinea, and possibly the Melanesian islands are, genetically - in the terminology of Kroeber - derived art, thus in this case derivatives from a centre in south-east Asia. It must not be overlooked, however, that this was a relatively recent development and that, if we follow Heine- Geldern,14 the curvilinear style in the western Pacific represents a much earlier expansion of an Asiatic art style, viz. of the Dongson culture (first millennium b.c.). Coming back to Speiser's theory, there is no need for us to consider a gradual trans- formation of Buddha images since there is a wealth of demoniacal types in Khmer art. In fact, what is known under this name in Cambodja was entirely Brahmanic from the eighth century a.d. onwards. It was not before the tenth century that followers of Buddhism appeared among the Brahmans of Cambodja.15 Incidentally, the conical hat worn by some korwar figures referred to by Speiser is also a typical feature in Khmer art, where it is usually found as forming the central part of the crowns of both princes and deities. We know that both the pantheon of Brahmanism and that of Mahayana Buddhism were introduced in Cambodja by Indians but that these were assisted by the native Khmers. In this way, features of native costumes became incorporated in the iconography of Khmer art. This brief and, of course, incomplete survey will suffice to provide at least a glimpse of the wealth of stimulating suggestions which we find throughout Felix Speiser's works. Whether we accept them or not, they all deserve our careful consideration and are bound to remain an inexhaustible source of themes for further research. A series of papers on Oceanian anthropology written by some of Speiser's friends and colleagues all over the world, which were originally designed to appear as an anniversary volume on his seventieth birthday, will now be published as a memorial volume in the Acta Tropica (Switzerland). 18 Kunststile in der Suedsee, pp. 31 f., figs. 9-12. 14 Compare R. von Heine-Geldern, " Prehistoric Research in the Netherlands Indies," in Science and Scientists in the Netherlands Indies, New York, 1945, p. 152 (with bibliography). 15 This is proved by an inscription deciphered by L. Fournereau (" Le Siam Ancien," I. (Annales du Musée Guimet, Vol. XXVII), pp. 55 if.). Angkor Thorn was built from the eighth to about the middle of the tenth century, and the Angkor Vat in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. All the earlier Khmer sculptures are Brahmanic. Eventually both religions and cults existed side by side, but there was only one art style, the sculptors working, by order of the king, " for the glory of both Siva and Buddha." Demons are, of course, particularly frequent in the famous reliefs illustrating the Ràmàyana.</page><page sequence="8">72 OBITUARY Felix Speiser's Principal Publications 1913.
