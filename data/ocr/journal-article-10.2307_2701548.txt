Until recently, early American literature did not, strangely enough, re- ceive deserving attention from literary scholars. To be sure, earnest study began in the late nineteenth century with the publication of Moses Coit Tyler's History of American Literature, 1607-1765 (1878) and The Literary History of the American Revolution (1897). Since the 1930s, significant ad- vancement has been made by such scholars as Perry Miller, Louis B. Wright, Kenneth Murdock, and Howard Mumford Jones, but their con- tributions are primarily as intellectual historians rather than as literary scholars. A new era did not begin until the 1960s, when a body of younger scholars launched serious study of early American letters. While impor- tant monographs started to appear in the major literary and historical journals, the Journal of Early American Literature was created in 1966 to serve as a vehicle for the new studies. Major Writers of Early American Literature (1972), edited by Everett Emerson, is among the first fruits of this new interest. Sacvan Bercovitch of Columbia University, one of the new breed and author of the formative study on typology ("Typology in New England: The Williams-Cotton Controversy Reassessed," American Quarterly, Summer 1967), in 1972 edited Typology and Early American Literature, in which he,contributed a significant introductory essay and a valuable lengthy annotated bibliography. In 1974 Bercovitch edited, with a useful introduction, another important book, The American Puritan Imagination: Essays in Revaluation, which reprinted eleven major articles originally published between 1963 and 1972. As a result of the extraordinary vigor exhibited by the recent scholars, including Norman Grabo, Karl Keller, David Levin, David Minter, Daniel Shea, Jr., Cecelia Tichi, and Larzer Ziff, the richness of early American literature has finally come to be duly exploited.

Because of its peculiarity in approach, apparent narrowness in focus (Cotton Mather's Life of John Winthrop as "The American Nehemiah"), and frequent use of highly technical terms, the book may attract only a very limited, specialized audience, and one which probably excludes many early American historians. Cotton Mather, who wrote over four hundred works and is one of the major figures in American literature but one of the least understood, has been the subject of Bercovitch's intense examina- tion for over a decade. By selecting a significant topic that no one has yet been fully committed to, Bercovitch makes a valuable contribution. Despite the fact that three out of the five chapters have already ap- peared as journal articles and the author relies throughout on previous works, both his own and others, the volume has considerable merit. While the author chose to emphasize the Magnalia Christi Americana ("The Mighty Acts of Christ in America"), he has explored the whole range of Mather's extensive writing. If his focus is narrow, Bercovitch's scope is unusually wide, set in a comparative context encompassing writing from St. Augustine to John Fiske and Edward Bellamy. The book is an exhaus- tive study of the development of the concept of American identity, deal- ing with the Puritan achievement in its broadest cultural framework. The value of the book lies in the first four chapters, in which Bercovitch tries to grasp the essence of Puritan rhetoric through the analysis of the nature of Mather's Life of Winthrop in terms of christology, typology, national election, and symbolism. He first examines the Puritan view of the self in the context of Mather's attitude toward Winthrop. The author points out that Mather, by selecting an apt title, Nehemias Americanus, portrayed his hero as a saint, as a model magistrate, and as the leader of a great enterprise. Mather's hybrid American Nehemiah, however, con- forms neither to the principles of hagiography nor to those of secular biography. It created, instead, a distinctive concept of the representative American saint. Nehemiah was, nevertheless, indispensable for Mather. For one thing, Mather used the Old Testament leader as exemplumfidei (a mode of imitatio that emphasized the spirit of the deed) for Winthrop's spiritual biog- raphy. The term "Nehemias Americanus" implies that Winthrop is like Christ because he is like Nehemiah. Furthermore, Mather was strongly influenced by the Lutheran principle of sola scriptura. Since the Reformers insisted on a christological reading of the Bible as it was made universally available and declared to be sole authority, all Puritan biographers includ-</page><page sequence="3">166 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / June 1976 ing Mather, Bercovitch argues, came to write as if they were bringing the Scriptures up to date through the lives of their subjects. Yet christology, which provided Mather with a superb rhetoric for biography, does not completely explain the real nature of his work. It is Winthrop's role in history, the author reasons, which really placed the biography in context. What united the Life of Winthrop with the corpo- rate action of the Magnalia is not the exemplariness of Nehemiah, but the idea of the exemplary American. So Bercovitch turns to another impor- tant subject, typology, which became virtually a family speciality with the Cottons and Mathers. Using typology, in which Christ, the "antitype," stood at the center of history, casting His shadow forward to the end of time as well as backward across the Old Testament, Bercovitch explains, Mather paralleled Winthrop and Nehemiah. Biographically, the two be- came correlative types of Christ, and historically, "the struggles of the New England saints at that time, in this place-the deeds Christ was now performing through them in America-were 'chronicled before they happened, in the figures and types of ancient story"' (p. 36). Typology, therefore, contributed much the same element as did christ- ology to Mather's Life of Winthrop. While christology equated the saint with the heroes of scripture, typology merged the saint's life with scrip- tural history. Bercovitch points out that the use of types is central to Mather's imagery. Although Winthrop as figura remains rooted in his- tory, his context is sacred rather than secular history. The purpose of Mather's figural technique is to refer the littera-historia in Winthrop's career, and in the Magnalia at large, to the history of redemption. Mather's Winthrop, the author contends, "is a man representative of his profes- sion, of his society, of sainthood, of his biographer, and, as 'Americanus,' of the conjunction of all of these with the providential wonders, the miracula apocalypsis, that demarcate the forward sweep of redemptive history" (p. 71). What, then, is so unusual about Mather's Winthrop? What is American about the rhetorical and conceptual design of Nehemias Americanus? For an answer Bercovitch moves to the idea of national election, which for the Puritan settlers involved both personal and historical redemption. The author points out an extraordinary continuity for the first three genera- tions in New England, where the rhetoric quickly became an institutional reality and interdependence of church and state came to mean mutuality, not interference. The Half-Way Covenant is not the sign of theocracy's decline but marks a high point in the formulation of American identity. Although too many of the founders' children did not have the "saving experience" which would qualify them for church membership, the</page><page sequence="4">KAWASHIMA / Puritan Persuasion 167 spiritual legacy had to continue from one generation to another. Since the still-unregenerate children were the heirs of salvation, they had received grace "through the loyns of godly Parents," as scions of the American Israel. Nor was the gradual collapse of the church-state directly due to the weakening of orthodoxy. Following Edmund Morgan, David Levin, David Hall, and others, Bercovitch maintains that the second and third generations sustained the piety of the first. Decline in church member- ship after the mid-1650s was a result, at least partly, of the seriousness with which the children responded to the demands of the fathers. Their sense of inadequacy and reluctance to profess sainthood suggest intensity of belief, not indifference. In the recurrent vexations recorded in Mather's Life of Winthrop the author sees the sustained imaginative vitality of the New England Way. The New England Way still needed a federal identity. While some never questioned their identity and some felt indifferent about it, the majority of the Puritans considered their social commitment crucial to their selfhood as Christians. They had to justify themselves by justifying America. The idea of national election thus took on a meaning undreamed of by the European Reformists. The New England Puritans, a chosen people, gave America the status of visible sainthood. Their concept con- tributed significantly "to the link between the New England and the American Way, to the usurpation of American identity by the United States, and to the anthropomorphic nationalism that characterizes our literature," not the "secular anthropomorphism of parenthood" but the "eschatological anthropomorphism of spiritual biography: American dream, manifest destiny, redeemer nation, and, fundamentally, the American self as representative of universal rebirth" (p. 108). Having thus far convincingly demonstrated that the Puritans' claim to visible sainthood led them to stress the importance of christology, that their rejection of separatism required them to define their venture "soteriologically," and that they combined the personal and historical modes of identity through their concept of natural election, Bercovitch now comes to examine the implication of the approach, formal and conceptual, that eventuated in Mather's Magnalia Christi Americana. The Puritans' image of America was a culmination of their effort to find a rhetoric adequate to their sense of mission. Having Americanized their rhetoric, they found in America the assurance of their destiny. Thus, the author argues, Mather made a peculiar use of the adjective in Nehemias Americanus, not "to modify the exemplum (as would be the case in Euro- pean ecclesiastical biography)" but "to make the exemplum indicate the</page><page sequence="5">168 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / June 1976 spiritual uniqueness of the locale" (p. 109). This Bercovitch calls a wholesale inversion of traditional hermeneutics. To understand Win- throp, one must see him as a saint, a latter-day Nehemiah, and the repre- sentative of a new chosen people simultaneously. Mather's rationale for blending the three perspectives (christology, soteriology, and national election) can be found in his vision of the New World. Early New England rhetoric, to Bercovitch, was a titanic effort to secularize traditional images without abandoning the claims of exegesis. Mather, turning exegesis inside out, transferred the source of meaning from scripture to secular history. He made his saints' lives emblematic of the story of America. While traditionally the epic heroes culminated the myth-making process, Mather's heroes delineated the myth in process. "To see Mather and Winthrop as Nehemiah," the author asserts, "is to identify with them as 'the American."' Winthrop is "the Nehemiah of New England then, as Mather is the Nehemiah of New England now, as the New England Way is the Nehemiah of the Reformation, and as the Reformation is the Nehemiah of the universal church, preparing to greet the Son of Righteousness, antitype of all Nehemiahs, who is to consecrate the apocalyptic marriage of the new heavens and new earth." Both Winthrop and Mather are representative of all this, because "the sub- stance of their heroism lies in the myth of America" (p. 135). Historians will be more interested in the final chapter of the volume, which outlines the Puritan rhetoric in the nineteenth century, especially American romanticism. The chapter is, unfortunately, less original than the earlier ones. Here, in surveying a general trend, based upon the works of others, Bercovitch points out that Mather's continual reference to himself as an American, like his concept of Winthrop as Americanus, signifies not a secularization but an amplification of "New Englander." The author sees Mather's method in the Magnalia as symptomatic of the movement from colonial to national identity. It was early New England rhetoric that provided a ready framework for inverting later secular val- ues (like human perfectibility, technological progress, democracy, and the American Way) into the mold of sacred teleology. The impact of the Puritan rhetoric, Bercovitch insists, appears most dramatically in the contrast between their vision of America and that of other New World colonists. While the Puritans conceived of the American paradise as the fulfillment of scriptural prophecy, the Spanish view of the New World was essentially utopian and opposed to the hermeneutics of Puritan American identity. Unlike Mather, the Spanish missionaries never equated colonization with the progress of the saints. Unlike the Puritans, who regarded the country as theirs and the Indians (they never</page><page sequence="6">KAWASHIMA I Puritan Persuasion 169 appear in the index!) as an obstacle to their destiny as Americans, the Spanish regarded the country as the Indians' and native recruitment as essential to their design of colonization. Throughout the eighteenth cen- tury the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life in the Spanish New World remained indistinguishable from that of Spain. There were great Spanish poems about the Indians and great American-born writers of Spanish literature, but "none of these creoles can be said to have begun an American literary tradition" (p. 142). By contrast, the myth of America was the creation of the New England Way or, more precisely, the product of a cultural continuity between Puritan and the nineteenth-century forms of eschatology. Bercovitch finds the evidence of this continuity most clearly in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose high hopes for the nation were deeply rooted "in the 'living, prospective, titanic American nature' the grand 'feeling, which the geography of America inevitably inspires"' (p. 158). Emerson insisted that nature must be the vehicle of one's thought and language, an exercise not in the powers of the individual imagination but in the philos- ophy of nature. In the similarity between "Emerson's equation of land- scape and redemptive history" and "the opening of the Magnalia, where Mather pictures the Ark of Christ en route to New England, changing geography into christianography" (p. 160), Bercovitch sees Emerson's vision serving to reaffirm that of the Puritans. As the most influential thinker of the period Emerson effectively sus- tained Puritan hermeneutics through the quintessential romantic doc- trine of sola natura and became the crucial figure in the cultural continuity. The American self, which Emerson interpreted through the medium of American nature, the symbol of the destiny of the New World, is, in Bercovitch's view, the most important aspect of Emerson's synthesis of Puritan hermeneutics and romantic naturalism. The distance between Mather and Emerson is doubtlessly noticeable in certain phrases, but these are new terms in an old context. The rhetorical strategy is the same; there are many echoes from the Magnalia in Emerson's writing. The author insists that rhetorical continuity signifies the importance of the legacy of seventeenth-century New England. The rhetoric survived, not by chance but by merit, compelling enough in content and flexible enough in form to invite adaptation. Puritan hermeneutics, Bercovitch reminds us, evolved through an essentially symbolic interaction of per- ceiver and fact, thus allowing for different perceivers and a variety of historical contexts. The desert-paradise allegoria remained constant, but the terms of signification could change with changing national needs. What for Mather had been the purifying wilderness became for Emer-</page><page sequence="7">170 REVIEWS IN AMERICAN HISTORY / June 1976 son's generation the redemptive West, as frontier, agrarian settlement, or virgin land. For well over two centuries, under the most diverse condi- tions, "the major spokesmen for a self-proclaimed people of God sub- sumed the facts of social pluralism in a comprehensive national ideal, transferred the terms of conflict formally inherent in that ideal from history to rhetoric, and secured the triumph of that rhetoric by identifying it with the assertion of a representative American self" (p. 186). The persistence of the myth, Bercovitch concludes, is a testament to the visionary and symbolic power of the American Puritan imagination. This is a book with complex and fascinating ideas that reflects the author's extensive knowledge and keen insight and that will endure repeated reading. Bercovitch has fully demonstrated the richness of the seventeenth-century New England imagination and has considerably deepened our understanding of the rhetoric of American identity. Yet his writing is a little too heavy and pedantic. One may wonder why the book could not have been made more readable and interesting. The difficulty indeed will have the effect of turning away many readers and, regretta- bly, will considerably reduce its usefulness to students of American history. At any rate, historians, including those early American specialists who consider the first part of the volume to be too specialized and narrow and who are disappointed with the sketchy treatment of the last part, will certainly look forward to Bercovitch's next projected, fuller treatment of the Puritan legacy to American romanticism.
