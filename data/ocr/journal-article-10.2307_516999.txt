(p. xcv) The volume concludes with an essential key to Swift's abbreviations and with two indexes which constitute the one major weakness in the work. The problem arises from the editorial decision to make the transcript a page for page rendering of the originals, with 'No editorial matter ... on any page' (p. cxxxv). This means that the indexes must explain as well as locate, and for this purpose they are not entirely adequate. The first is in fact not an index proper, but rather a 'Concordance' to all the words (proper names only excepted) which appear in the transcript; the second is an 'Index of Proper Names' in transcript and introduction alike. Thus, the reference to a 'quarto Bible' (p. 164) is listed under 'quarto' in the concordance, and 'Bible' in the index. However, the entry 'Hang Alba via for Blundring' (p. 294), while properly indexed under Mrs Whiteway, appears in the concordance under 'alba via' with no cross-reference to help the Latin-less reader seeking a gloss. Moreover, while the concordance serves as a passable subject index where 'brandy' and 'breeches' are concerned, it falls down elsewhere. Thus, while the purchases which Swift records merely as 'Books' or '5 Books' (p. 71) are grouped together in the concordance under 'book', those where he notes author or title, as 'Corneille &amp; Moliere' or 'Theatr Ital.' (p. 66) appear only in the name index-widely scattered. Finally there are the inevitable errors, and omissions. Swift's bookseller was Benjamin Tooke the younger, not the elder (p. li); and his printer, John Barber, is certainly not the 'Barbr' advanced 5s. 5d. in Ireland in January 17o1 (p. 98) as the index implies. There is no explanation of the difference between English and Irish money though one is sorely needed in the face of repeated amounts like 6id., is. id., or 2s. 8id.; the angle brackets used to indicate excised material are very poorly drawn and often fail to print; and the facsimile which is promised on p. xciv is certainly not included in the copy sent for review. However, in spite of these and other small faults this remains not merely a useful, but an indispensable work, which every serious Swift scholar will consider cheap at the price. It is also, manifestly, a labour of love, and all the Dean's friends will be deeply grateful for it. MICHAEL TREADWELL Romantic Contraries: Freedom versus Destiny. By PETER L. THORSLEV, JR. Pp. x + 226. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, I984. 1E9-50 net. This is an ambitious attempt at intellectual synthesis, examining the history of ideas in the late Enlightenment and Romantic period, in the tradition of Abrams's The Mirror and the Lamp and Natural Supernaturalism. It does not have the stature of these seminal works, nor the dauntingly encyclopaedic erudition of Wellek or McFarland, but can be recommended for an undergraduate audience as a sound introduction to a central aspect of Romanticism. One caveat, however: despite the publisher's blurb, it is not fair to say that 'almost equal emphasis' is placed on the history of ideas and on literary criticism. Text dissolves disappointingly into context. Professor Thorslev takes as his theme the conflict between determinism and individual freedom and responsibility. The first part of the book examines (perhaps at undue length, in view of the familiarity of the material) the history of relevant ideas in the eighteenth century to supply an intellectual context and establish a framework of analysis for later discussions. It comes as no surprise to read that the problem of determinism was particularly acute in the late eighteenth century: in a Newtonian universe in which God had come to seem superfluous, mechanistic</page><page sequence="2">determinism was gradually extended from the phenomenal world to the human mind, either negating free will altogether or reducing it to a mere epiphenomenon. Well-trodden ground perhaps, but Thorslev's survey of eighteenth-century theo- dicy and the origins of Romantic vitalism is well documented, and although there may be few startlingly new insights here his lucid discrimination of terminology which is all too frequently misused (e.g. destiny, fatalism, determinism) is most valuable. In the second half of the book Thorslev examines how freedom and destiny inform Romantic thought as opposing principles, varying in inverse proportions like Blake's Reason and Energy. He classifies the Romantic age into three dominant world views or hypothetical 'universes'-the 'organic', the 'Gothic', and the 'open'-each of which reacted against 'the myth of the mechanized universe of eighteenth-century physics and rational theology' to restore to man 'some sense of individual freedom, and some sense of a social and universal destiny'. The 'organic universe', in Thorslev's account, is characterized by belief in an immanent destiny which unites man and nature in the freedom of purposive self- determination. This world view proposed to remove man's alienating self- consciousness either by assimilating mind to nature or nature to mind, restoring to man the security of participating in a universal destiny. Such an approach entailed the assumption of an immanent moral benevolence in nature, often made explicit in what Thorslev (by analogy with Hegel's 'Cunning of Reason' (die List der Vernunft)) terms Wordsworth's 'Cunning of Nature'. A more courageous alternative to this compromise fusion of consciousness with nature was the 'Organic Sublime'. This denied any moral teleology in the universe, substituting instead an amoral delight in the sheer plenitude of the creative force. It is here, I feel, that Thorslev's argument is least convincing. His selective account of the sublime fails to grant sufficient weight to the theological assumptions which had become conventionally inextricable from this genre, while his thesis that the sublime in nature is essentially amoral requires, at best, more extensive justification. Destiny in the 'Gothic universe' by contrast is not immanent but transcendent. In this fatalistic world view suprarational powers operate through anthropomorphic deities whose intermittent influence on man is generally malevolent and from the human perspective remains inscrutably capricious. Man's freedom and dignity are assured only by resolute opposition to this transcendent destiny. This is a useful chapter, economical and stimulating. The third world view which Thorslev considers is that of the 'open universe' in which there is no destiny, whether immanent or transcendent. Here man in isolation assumes the burden of existentialist freedom, forced to create his own provisional order in an apparently contingent universe which confronts him with indifference. Thorslev's survey ranges from Godwin to Pater, analysing rigorously various theories of Romantic irony. I noticed only three oddities in this attractively designed and well-indexed book: T. S. Eliot's 'dissociation of sensibilities' (pp. 34, 35); Wordsworth's ascent of 'Snowden' (pp. 68, 98); and Kant's curiously dative Dingen-an-sich (p. 158).
