<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLLEGE ENGLISH Volume 30 January 1969 Number 4 Talk-Write: A Behavioral Pedagogy for Composition ROBERT ZOELLNER I BECAUSE THE METAPHOR reaches its highest development in the literary artifact, teachers of literature and language probably know more about this complex verbal structure-its inner dynamic, its psycho-philosophical bases, and its signifi- cations-than anybody else. But I suggest that the English teacher's intense literary awareness of the metaphor-as-artifact results in a peculiar professional Robert Zoellner teaches English at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. He has pub- lished articles on American literature, and is co-author with Clarence A. Brown of The Strategy of Composition: A Rhetoric with Readings (Ronald Press 1968). Mr. Zoellner wishes to express his thanks to Colorado State University for a Quarter Research Sabbatical (1968) during which much of this study was written. EDITOR'S NOTE: We are devoting almost the entire issue to "Talk-Write: A Behavioral Pedagogy for Composition," a monograph by Robert Zoellner. Doing so calls for a word of explanation. In my own editorial opinion, the monograph presents a strong and original argument on a subject of general interest to the readership of College English: that is sufficient reason for publication. But I want to offer a few gratuitous comments on the spirit of this decision. First, I think most people will agree that virtually no academic subject gets taught in such a variety of ways as does composition, many of those ways mutually incompatible in their assumptions. Appar- ently we have no wide agreement on the nature and purpose of English 101. Second, the results of our teaching are at best mixed. How we judge our success depends in part on whether we think of English 101 as teaching students to write fluently, teaching them to think well, preparing them for liberal education, "exposing" them to some of the best that has been thought and known, helping them to become intelligent citizens, qualifying them for specific careers, or serving one or more of many other announced and covert aims. But even if we agree for a moment on one aim, such as the first, our success in achieving it can be, has been, seriously questioned. In so indistinct a situation as this, I think that an argument like Mr. Zoellner's, which unpacks and sorts out a lot of conceptual baggage, is particularly valuable. Or should be. But it will not be if we regard it as establishing still another method or school or approach, in a field already littered with gimmicks, hunches, and personal strategies. Mr. Zoellner questions a deep tacit assumption which he finds behind our pedagogy; he proposes a different set of instrumental concepts. I think that it would be healthy for us to meet him on this level, and I hope, therefore, that his monograph will provoke some responses in kind (I have the same hope of the articles on composition in the November 1968 issue). The pages of CE will be open to a continuing discussion of this sort. RICHARD OHMANN 267</page><page sequence="2">268 COLLEGE ENGLISH blind spot: he often appears only minimally aware of the mediative aspect of metaphor, which we may call metaphor-as-instrument. Yet there is obviously a vast difference between the metaphor the English professor teaches-say in Hopkins or Donne-and the metaphor he teaches by. The point is best made by glancing at the uses of instrumental metaphor in the conceptually "distant" fields of science and technology. The molecular biologist, for example, uses X-ray diffraction to derive the electron densities of a protein molecule. He then feeds these values into a computer which, after a nanosecond or two of rumination, renders a visual image of the physical topography of the molecule on an oscilloscope screen. The mediating computive process is so window-like that such specialists habitually speak of the "transparent computer." Again, the particle physicist, concerned with such fundamental metaphors as the "right-handedness" and/or "left-handedness" of Nature, undergirds his discursive analyses of inframolecular events with metaphorical constructs such as a "magic mirror" which reflects these events from the vantage point of some largely hypothetical "mirror universe." On a somewhat less exotic level, the ecologist appears unable to write a paragraph without speaking of ecological "niches," food "chains," and plant "communities," while the cell biologist addresses him- self to the activities of "messenger" RNA in the "programming" of molecular and cellular "architecture." Even the soils specialist, not generally given to poetic flights, has much to say about nitrogen "lock-up." The teacher of En- glish does not need a technical command of physics, biology, or agronomy to recognize immediately that all of these are instrumental conceptual constructs. They are the metaphors one uses to think. Much more to the point here, they are also the metaphors one uses to teach. Even clearer examples of instrumental metaphor' can be found in fields such as psychology, which are conceptually much closer to language and literature. Psychodynamic theory of the personality, typified by the Freudian hypothesis, is one vast texture of metaphors, drawing on topology (or perhaps geography) for the Id-Ego-Super Ego structure, on an analogy to physical medicine for the concepts of symptom and underlying disease (of which more later), and on an hydraulic model for the dynamics of repression, displacement, and sublimation. Indeed, the quality of scientific advance in a given field often appears to be a direct correlate of the instrumental metaphors which give shape to the research in that field. Theodore R. Sarbin, for example, in the course of a behavioral 1 What I call instrumental metaphor, M. H. Abrams, in pursuit of very different objectives, calls constitutive metaphor. In the course of his analysis of nineteenth-century critical theory, he points out that "Metaphysical systems are intrinsically metaphorical systems," a fact which has shaped the history of literary criticism, where "certain more or less submerged conceptual models" have been devised to help "select, interpret, systematize, and evaluate the facts of art ... While many expository analogues," he concludes, "as conventional opinion proposes, are casual and illustrative, some few seem recurrent and, not illustrative, but constitutive: they yield the ground plan and essential structural elements of a literary theory, or of any theory." Specifically, Abrams is of course concerned with the eighteenth-century constitutive or instru- mental metaphor which makes the human mind a mirror reflecting reality mimetically, in contrast to the nineteenth-century formulation which makes the mind a post-Kantian lamp illuminating reality creatively. See The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (New York, 1953, 1958), pp. 30-31. For examples of the way in which instru- mental metaphor functions in educational theory, see B. F. Skinner's discussion of the "three great metaphors" which have been devised to describe the behavior of the educated person and to conceptualize the relationship between teacher and student in terms of horticultural, osmotic, gastronomic, sexual, and medical analogues, in The Technology of Teaching (New York, 1968), pp. 1-5; hereafter referred to as TT.</page><page sequence="3">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 269 analysis of hypnosis, makes the point that the progress of knowledge of this difficult phenomenon can be traced in terms of a series of defining instrumental metaphors. Mesmer, drawing on an analogy from electromagnetic induction, suggested that the hypnotic trance was "induced" by "animal magnetism" emanat- ing in some manner from the hypnotist. Braid, who coined the words "hypnol- ogy" and "hypnotism," based his theories on a metaphorical construct which made hypnosis a special kind of "sleep." "Each of these metaphors, and others as well," Sarbin continues, "has had a life and has declined and died because they were replaced by metaphors more in keeping with concurrent scientific vocabu- laries. Also, as we know from the history of science, inventions and discoveries in other areas provided a cognitive framework for establishing a new meta- phor." The new metaphor which Sarbin utilizes in his own analysis of hypnosis is, as he points out, "drawn from the theater and everyday life": it is a metaphor which asserts that much human behavior can be accounted for in terms of "role-playing" or "role-enactment"-and the most cursory reading in current research will establish the broad applications and insights which this instrumental metaphor is making possible in psychology and related fields.2 I cite these examples of instrumental metaphor from various domains of science because I wish to examine the thesis that (a) theory and practice in English composition is presently dominated by such an instrumental metaphor, and (b) that this metaphor is outmoded, grossly simplistic, and inhibitory of genuine progress in teaching students on any level to write effectively. The question is important because defining instrumental metaphors are so fundamental and pervasive that we tend to forget that they are metaphors and act as if they were "fact"; and metaphors sanctioned by long usage and tradition frequently become part of the largely unconscious intellectual baggage that we bring to our pro- fessional considerations. This is, I think, the situation in English composition today. The pervasively defining intrumental metaphor in our teaching of composition and rhetoric can be easily and succinctly stated: it asserts that the written word is thought on paper. In slightly different terms, it equates the act of thought with the act of writing in the sense that the scribal stream "symbolizes" both vocal utter- ance and the thought which generates it. We English teachers do not, of course, adhere consistently to this metaphorical equation: we have all told students, for example, to "think before they write," an admonition which at least in tem- poral terms makes thinking separate from and anterior to the act of writing. But this non-metaphorical formulation solves no problems and indeed raises another question: if writing is not thought in some form, then what is it? If we answer 2Theodore R.

Their humanistic commitment will prevent most English teachers from being comfortable with such a conclusion. Generally, however, we adhere-sometimes consciously but more often un- consciously-to an instrumental metaphor which establishes some largely un- defined one-to-one relationship between the thinking process on the one hand and the written word on the other. This equivalence is evident, for example, in the majority of the textbooks that we assemble for our students. One could easily fill a five-foot bookshelf with high school and college texts which ignore entirely the act of writing, which have little or nothing to say about the action which stands as a central term between thought on the one hand and the written word on the other. The writer-as-actor seldom appears. Overwhelmingly, our textbooks-and the theory which produces them-are product-oriented rather than process-oriented, taking for the most part an artifactual and textual approach to the written (past tense) word and to the logical and intellective imperatives which we assume can account entirely and completely for its genesis. The student is burdened with long chapters on "clear thinking" and "logical analysis"; we divert him with the Aristotelian elegancies of the outline, and immerse him in undistributed middles, ladders of abstraction, and squares of opposition. In all of this we are assuming that if we can somehow get the student to think clearly, he will thereupon write clearly. This is not only our great metaphor. It may also be our great myth. When we return an "F" theme to the student, we are likely to tell him in our written comment that we failed the theme because he had not "ordered his thoughts properly" or had "expressed himself obscurely," forgetting entirely that these are mentalistic assertions which Pavlov (among many others) dep- recated because of their logical circularity. To tell a student that his theme is unclear and disorganized because his thought is faulty is roughly the same as asserting that "Fred ate a big meal because he was hungry," or that "Frank struck out with his fists because he was angry." Such explanations explain nothing because we have simply substituted one verbal formulation for a given segment of human behavior for another verbal formulation of the same seg- ment. I do not suggest that as English teachers we stop talking about planning and organization; nor am I saying that logical thought has nothing to do with the compositional process. I am only suggesting that our present "think-write" in- strumental metaphor ignores or glosses over certain central elements of the act of writing. What some of these elements are can be easily ascertained by simply observing a group of students writing an in-class theme or an hour's essay test. Here, for instance, is Student A, a bright and articulate senior: we are only twenty minutes into the hour, but already she has covered five bluebook pages, her pen moving effortlessly, swiftly, and without pause over the paper. Next to her sits Student B. From earlier class discussion I know that he is even more insightful and articulate than Student A; his vocal comments have suggested to me that he may be of graduate caliber. But something is wrong. He sits hunched intensely over his desk, laboriously drawing each word rather than writing it. He has covered only two bluebook pages, and I can tell from the expression on his face that he knows he's not cutting it. Student B is therefore a puzzle: he walks, he talks, he acts with a facility equal to that of Student A;</page><page sequence="5">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 271 indeed, if it were otherwise, if he spoke, or opened doors, or tied his shoe-laces, or drove a car as haltingly and painfully as he writes, I would send him to a hospital. I am absolutely certain that he thinks with rapidity and precision. Why can't he write that way? Student C, in the back of the room, will be more successful as a housewife than as a Ph.D. candidate-but a couple of office conferences have made it clear that her mind is more than adequate, her vocal facility unexceptionable. Yet there she sits, locked hopelessly in an obsessive and circular little ritual. She writes a sentence, and then she reads it over, her lips moving soundlessly-and then she reads it over again, and then again. She re-dots her "i's" and re-crosses her "t's," as if putting the final touches on an oil painting. She reads the sentence over two more times, and then at long last plunges ahead. This is not a caricature: while I have no hard data on scribal ritualism in college students, unobtrusive eye- movement counts during test periods make it clear that many students cannot write a sentence until they have re-read the previous sentence from three to ten times. In even worse shape is Student D; half way through the hour, when he ought to be warmed up and moving along rapidly, I find his desk covered with springs and ink-cartridges. He has instituted a thousand-mile overhaul of his ballpoint pen in the middle of the test. Student E, female and feminine, spends a six full minutes (I time her)-ten percent of the available test time-addressing herself to the cuticle-and-hangnail problem. Yet I remember that both of these students had things to say on the "Queen Mab" chapter of Moby-Dick which would have held a creditable place in a published article. These students must be distinguished from Student F, who presents no prob- lem. He has been cutting class and is obviously hung-over, in no shape to write anything. But Students A through E, multiplied by the thousands, constitute a massive indictment of current teaching methods in English composition at all levels, if only because large numbers of them have a 3.0 or better grade-point in those courses where the objective test has replaced the essay. They are intelligent, articulate, and vocal-but much evidence suggests that they write as badly when they leave college as they did when thev entered. It is time we explored the possibility that these failures have their source in the massive deficiencies of our instrumental think-write metaphor, which furnishes us with a pedagogy exclusively intellective and mentalistic, and therefore comfort- ably in consonance with our humanistic commitment. This is perhaps the nub of the problem: our humanism may be getting in the way of our common sense, which should have told us long ago that the writing difficulties I have just de- scribed cannot be due entirely to "poor preparation" or "faulty thinking"- whatever these vague and empirically inaccessible entities may be-but rather to faulty or maladaptive behavior. There would appear to be a concrete, discrimi- nable, and empirically accessible behavioral dimension to the act of writing to which we have insufficiently attended. One need not, however, confine oneself to classroom observation of the student actually engaged in scribal activity. The papers that come out of the theme or test situation-if viewed in a certain light-provide copious evidence of the existence of a behavioral dimension in the scribal act. But rather than inflict upon the reader yet another dreary catalog of horrible examples of student writing, I would rather suggest very quickly the practical difficulties of our think-write metaphor. When, for example, a student tells me that in Philip</page><page sequence="6">272 COLLEGE ENGLISH Freneau's "The House of Night," "everything is so dreary and foreboding that the story is told in a dreary setting," and later in the same essay asserts that the Romantic stress on imagination "tends to make the poetry more lively and give more life to the poem," I may mark in the margin, "wordy and repeti- tive." Here I am concentrating on the "write" half of the metaphor, or more precisely, the written word as artifact. The difficulty is that in telling the student that he is wordy and repetitive I am revealing the pervasive textual bias which is the logical concomitant of the instrumental metaphor; I am direct- ing both my attention and the student's to a certain characteristic of the text- as-product rather than to the characteristics of the scribal act which produced it. I am dealing with an effect, and adroitly avoiding the problem of cause altogether. Similarly, when a sophomore tells me that he thinks Benjamin Franklin "would be very hard to have for a friend, for he was definitely a self-made man with little formal education and he let everyone know it," I may comment in the margin, "personalistic, subjective, and irrelevant." The referents for these three evaluative terms are obviously logico-mentalistic, and assume the presence of something called "faulty thought"-but it is just as credible to assume that the student's comment is a specimen of learned behavior, and that the student is responding to "Benjamin Franklin" in the only way he knows how. The same problem appears with the student who defines tabula rasa as the idea "that Man's soul was a blank sheet of paper and it was Man's idea to keep it that way." If I write "comic-book oversimplification" in the margin of the test, I am again positing the presence of faulty thought processes. But we must address ourselves to the possibility that the student's version of tabula rasa represents a reductive pattern of response which is behavioral rather than in- tellective. Many students have told me that they "knew better" or "didn't mean to say that"-and it is possible we ought to believe such assertions. The crucial question of belief in the average student's intellectual integrity -as well as the question of reading the evidence properly-is best highlighted by what might be called the behavioral "happenings" which are such a common feature of office interviews with students. Miss X told me earnestly in a theme that "one of the nicest things about Denver is that everyone has a nice place to live." When, during an office conference, I twitted her about this greeting- card assertion, she became visibly irritated. Well, if I was going to be that way about it, of course she knew that everyone in Denver did not have a nice place to live-did I take her for a fool? Miss X thought me the most unreasonable of men: I was taking her scribal assertions seriously, thus substituting new ground-rules for the ones to which she was clearly accustomed. The significant thing here is not so much the scribal artifact that Miss X produced, but rather her behavior, the pattern of responses that she brought to bear in the writing situation. A similar problem arose with Miss Y, a senior who signed up for my Com- position Analysis class because she was an English certification candidate. When I asked the class to compose a series of topic sentences on subjects of "urgent interest" to the average high school student, this future English teacher came up with this: "A happy person is one whose inner beauty shines through." When in conference I asked Miss Y if she really believed that the average high school student-involved in 300 cubes with four on the floor, the atonalities of Simon and Garfunkel, and the sexual urgencies of adolescence-would find</page><page sequence="7">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 273 "inner beauty" a compelling theme topic, she found the idea laughable. Actually, she said, she hoped to focus her professional career on special education for delinquent adolescents, and she knew perfectly well that she would "probably have to yank the marijuana cigarettes out of their mouths before I can ever get them to talk about 'inner beauty'." But when I asked her why she did not draw on this hard-nosed realism when formulating theme topic assignments, she was unable to give an account of her behavior. Miss X and Miss Y may or may not be typical of college writers-but it would appear to be entirely hopeless to. insist endlessly and ritualistically on the priority of clear thought and the instrumental utility of the think-write metaphor if in actual fact we are on the college level encountering significant numbers of students who have been taught-or conditioned to-a behavioral pattern of responses to the writing situation which involves the conscious or unconscious dissociation of what the student really thinks on the one hand, from what he actually writes on the other. Before we commit ourselves irre- vocably to a totalistically intellective pedagogy, we ought to first ascertain whether thought stands in immediate relation to scribal activity, or whether there exists an intervening behavioral term which, in the phrasing of the infor- mation theorists, constitutes a quantifiable and manipulatively accessible amount of "noise in the channel." The solution, of course, may be to exploit other available channels. Indeed, the most compelling and suggestive office-interview "happening" occurs when I read the student's utterly opaque and impenetrable sentence or paragraph aloud to him. "Mr. Phillips," I say, "I simply can't make head nor tail out of this paragraph; what in the world were you trying to say?" When I pose this question in this situation, large numbers of students, certainly a majority, re- spond with a bit of behavior which I suggest may be of immense significance for the teaching of composition. They open their mouths, and they say the thing they were unable to write. "Well, Dr. Zoellner," they usually begin, "all I meant to say in that paragraph was that . . .," and out it comes, a sus- tained, articulated, rapid-fire segment of "sound-stream," usually from five to fifteen seconds' duration, which communicates to me effectively and quickly what they "had in mind" when they produced the impenetrable paragraph I hold in my hand. And all I had to do to elicit this fascinating bit of behavior was to ask them to shift from the scribal modality to the vocal modality. These explanatory segments of sound-stream, which a linguist would call free utterances, I call "cortical utterances," or, in the case of some topics and some students, "visceral blurts." I think they are important for two reasons. In the first place, I wonder if the cortical utterance or visceral blurt does not shoot a large hole in our instrumental think-write metaphor. If Mr. Phillips' para- graph does not communicate to the reader, most of us would assert that Mr. Phillips obviously hadn't "taken enough time" to sort out and order his ideas. But when I ask him what he meant in the paragraph, his vocal response to this question is characterized by alacrity and immediacy: there is generally little hesitation, little fumbling, and no discernible time-segment when he might be assumed to be re-thinking the paragraph. In fact, the reflexive rapidity of the cortical utterance suggests strongly that Mr. Phillips had thought it out, and that if the paragraph is opaque the problem lies not in the realm of thought, but elsewhere. In the second place, I suggest that the cortical utterance or visceral blurt is</page><page sequence="8">274 COLLEGE ENGLISH important because it may possibly provide us with a point d'appui from which to build a new instrumental metaphor and a new pedagogy which will be, in Theodore Sarbin's phrase, "more in keeping with concurrent scientific vocabu- laries." The cortical utterance is, of course, vocal rather than scribal. Con- sequently, as a communicative unit, it exhibits all the lingual and paralingual characteristics of the sound stream which are not available in the scribal modal- ity. But when we strip these vocal characteristics away we are frequently if not always left with a word-pattern substrate which is (a) protoscribal and (b) rhetorically viable. It won't do as writing, but it may furnish us with a behaviorally derived datum which we can use to begin to teach writing. Even more important, by shifting our attention from thought process to operative utterance we shift our pedagogy from that which is empirically inaccessible to a phenomenon which is observable and manipulatable. Finally, for the generalized and abstractive imperatives of thought we substitute the behaving student in all his uniqueness and individuality. But if the cortical utterance gives us a point d'appui for a new pedagogy, it does not, of itself, give us a rationale for that pedagogy. For this we must turn elsewhere, and I now propose to take the reader through a quick review of certain principles underlying what behavioral psychologists call "learning theory." This can best be accomplished by turning our attention to the behavior of infra- human organisms such as the white rat in a "learning situation," and then making the extrapolation-perhaps successfully and perhaps not-from rodent to student.3 III The first thing to be said is that "learning" for the humanist is a very dif- ferent thing from "learning" for the behavioral scientist. The two must not be confused. When a teacher in disciplines such as English speaks of learning, he generally means some internal event, involving cognition, apprehension, ab- sorption, or understanding and remembering. In contrast to such intellective and mentalistic formulations, learning for the behavioral scientist means a rep- licable and measurable external event, specifically the frequency or rate at which an organism "emits" a discriminable "bit" in the behavioral continuum. The entirely external nature of such behavioral events means that, at least in theory, they may be handled in the same way as an event in physics or chemistry. In the experimental situation these events often take place in what everyone in the trade but B. F. Skinner calls a "Skinner-box," which is simply an almost featureless enclosure containing a manipulandum-a lever or perhaps a colored plastic disk. Outside the box there is a counting mechanism linked to the lever or disk so that the rate or frequency of some sharply defined and delimited bit-of-behavior such as "depressing the lever" or "pecking the disk" can be recorded against time to produce a learning curve. Inside the box near the manipulandum is a food-pellet delivery tray which can either be linked mechani- cally to the manipulandum for automatic delivery, or can be under the control of the experimenter observing the animal. The whole mechanism is designed to give the experimenter control of the elements of a three-term paradigm which can be summarized as stimulus- 3For a general behavioral discussion of learning, addressed to student teachers and using a vocabulary somewhat different from what I shall employ here, see James M. Thyne, The Psychology of Learning and Techniques of Teaching (New York, 1963).</page><page sequence="9">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 275 response-reinforcement. From the practicing teacher's point of view it is per- haps unfortunate that behavioral scientists did not draw on this paradigm for their central term instead of adopting the highly traditionalized and connota- tively dense word "learning"; considerable misunderstanding might have been avoided if they had evolved a new term, such as "REF Theory," with the "REF" standing for "Response Emission Frequency." But since it is unlikely that researching scientists will ever adopt my term for their theory, I will cut the Gordian Knot by using the word "learning" in both the humanistic and behavioral senses, depending on context. In the most rudimentary Skinner-box situation, the experimenter begins with the random stream-of-behavior of, say, a white rat in the box. The food de- livery tray is made inoperative. Part of the behavioral repertory of the naive rat will be purely "accidental" depressions of the lever during initial free ex- ploration of the box. These "fortuitous" depressions are counted over a fixed period of time, establishing a base-line behavioral rate. The food magazine is then connected to the lever. The next time the rat "accidentally" depresses the lever-a response4-the automatic mechanism instantly delivers a food pellet to the tray-a reinforcement or "environmental consequence." More precisely, the food pellet is a response-contingent reinforcement, where "reinforcement" is defined as any alteration in the environment, contingent upon a response, which alters the probability that the response will again occur.5 The reinforce- ment results in learning if the initial bit-of-behavior that was reinforced now begins to occur at a rate or frequency higher than the base-line rate of the naive animal. (From a behavioral point of view it would, of course, be unfor- giveably mentalistic and anthropomorphic to assert that the rat "gets the idea," "makes the connection," or "grasps" the learning situation; a rigorous formula- tion simply asserts that he emits a specified bit-of-behavior which was part of his naive repertory at a higher rate.) It is important to note that learning may take place in this rudimentary situa- tion with little or no attention to the first term of the stimulus-response- reinforcement paradigm. However, the concept of stimulus may now become part of the experimental structure in a formal sense: a red and a green light, for example, may be introduced into the box, the rat quickly learning to re- spond when the green light is on, but not when the red is. This additional dimension gives the experimenter stimulus control which in the rat is called stimulus discrimination. Finally, unlearning may occur (not "forgetting"); when, for example, the emission rate drops toward base-line because we are withholding reinforcement when the behavior occurs, the behavior is being brought to the point of extinction. 4 Using the term "response" for this initial bit-of-behavior-as the literature consistently does- is somewhat confusing because it appears to imply the existence of a known and specified stimulus anterior to and causative of the response. The behaviorist does indeed assume that in the behavioral stream such a stimulus did occur, but it is not necessarily known and is not specified: theoretically the experimenter is not even interested in what the stimulus might have been. He simply allows the animal to "behave along" for as long as necessary until he "emits" the desired bit-of-behavior called a "response." (It should be added that my use of the terms "accidental" and "fortuitous" lacks the rigor the behaviorist would insist upon. Nothing is causally accidental or fortuitous in the behavioral continuum, but only unknown or unspecified.) 5The food pellet is a primary reinforcer; the audible click of the food magazine may be a secondary reinforcer; and if the rat were susceptible to praise and approval for his performance-which apparently he is not-we would have a social reinforcer.</page><page sequence="10">276 COLLEGE ENGLISH Much more important and suggestive than this rudimentary process, how- ever, is the fact that certain refinements and extensions make it possible to eventually teach the organism behaviors which are not part of his naive reper- tory. The process is called shaping, and has, I think, substantial pedagogical implications for teaching college students-or third graders, for that matter- to write. The most rudimentary shaping situation is one in which the experimenter wishes to shape some simple bodily movement of the organism, without de- manding that the organism effect some alteration in the environment, such as pressing a lever. For this the experimenter can use a simplified Skinner-box which is equipped with a food pellet delivery tray under the control of the experimenter, but from which the usual manipulandum is missing. Suppose, for example, that the experimenter has a pigeon in such a simplified box, and that he wishes to shape the bodily movement of the pigeon toward some highly specific and delimited bit-of-behavior such as "holding the head as high as possible." The experimenter begins by exploiting the naive behavioral repertory of the pigeon, the most fundamental element of which is, of course, simple physical movement. The experimenter will therefore initiate the shaping process by delivering a food pellet the instant the pigeon moves. Then, successively, he will reinforce only head movement, then head movement upward, and finally he will reinforce only extreme movements of the head upward. Thus, by successive stages, he gradually shapes the behavioral stream until he has a pigeon which consistently holds his head as high as possible in order to be rewarded or reinforced by the food pellet delivery tray. What works for a pigeon will also work, of course, with much more com- plex organisms which may be shaped toward effecting some alteration in the environment in a Skinner-box equipped with the usual manipulandum. Murray Sidman, for example, gives a lucid description of the shaping of primate be- havior: Shaping is accomplished by reinforcing successively closer approximations to the behavior with which the experimenter ultimately wants to work. The experimental situation... may be one in which a monkey is to be reinforced with food for pressing a lever. If the monkey just sits quietly at first, the experimenter will wait until the animal moves and will then immediately deliver the food. By continuing to reinforce all movements, the experimenter will soon have an active animal with which to work. He then reinforces only those responses which bring the animal closer to the lever. Within a few reinforcements, the monkey will have moved close to the lever, as if drawn by an invisible string. The experimenter now directs his attention to the animal's hand. He delivers the food whenever the hand moves closer to the lever, and it is not long before the animal places its hand on the lever and depresses it. The experimenter can then turn the rest of the job over to his automatic apparatus, which will deliver the food only when the animal actually depresses the lever. By such procedures very complex behavioral "bits" can be shaped into the organism. A pigeon, for example, can be shaped toward "turning to the left." A skilled experimenter can, in a short time, develop a pigeon who spends his days executing a counter-clockwise circle. Stimulus discrimination may then be introduced, giving the experimenter a pigeon which circles to the left when a green light is on, and to the right when the light is red. Moreover, such dis- crete behavioral "bits" may be linked in the process called "chaining." The</page><page sequence="11">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 277 pigeon may be further conditioned so that a turn to the right serves as a be- havioral "cue" for a turn to the left, and a turn to the left as a cue for a turn to the right. The result is a pigeon which earns its living by tracing out a figure-eight in a fluid, continuous cue-chain.6 It will be obvious, of course, that the whole process of behavioral shaping, and in particular the technique of chaining, have profound implications for language learning and language use. But this is an area of basic research at too many removes from the immediate pedagogic problem to concern us here. What may conceivably be of immediate application in the composition class- room are the principles underlying operant learning techniques, principles which may furnish us with a critique of present pedagogical methods in composition, and possibly some suggestions for a new pedagogical direction. However, before examining these principles, it is at this point necessary to digress briefly, establishing precisely what sort of conditioning we are talking about here, and what sort of conditioning we are not talking about. The teacher of English must distinguish carefully, for both philosophical and pedagogic reasons, between reflex (Pavlovian, classical, respondent) conditioning and the operant (Skinnerian, instrumental) conditioning which is the concern of this study. Reflex conditioning is in general not concerned with the central or "higher" nervous system which directs skeleto-muscular activity and external behavior. Rather, reflex conditioning is directed toward the much older, more primitive autonomic (vegetative, involuntary) nervous system which directs the internal and unconscious activities of the gastric secretive mechanism and the smooth muscle structures of the stomach and intestine, as well as more externalized, semi-involuntary activities such as sweating, blushing, and eye-blink. The crucial point is that reflex conditioning is centered on an essentially coercive (Skinner's word) use of an external stimulus: Pavlov's famous ringing bell exploits the reflexively coercive nature of the autonomic nervous system, "forcing" the dog to salivate. There is consequently no freedom in the reflex conditioning process. Even in contemporary experimentation the animal is usually strapped down while the exprimenter manipulates such an internal activity as the vestibular reaction of balancing, or establishes a urinary or cardiac con- ditioned reflex-whether the organism will or no. The popular notion of con- ditioning appears to be based entirely on this Pavlovian model, and if a great many people, and especially those such as teachers of English who entertain 61It goes without saying that this entire description of Skinner-box conditioning represents a Sunday-supplement redaction of an extremely sophisticated laboratory methodology. For a succinct and reasonably accessible discussion which will suggest the complexities I have assiduously excluded here, see Murray Sidman, "Operant Techniques," in EFCP, pp. 170-210. For an illustration of the archetypal Skinner-box, see Skinner, BO, p. 49; Chapters II and III of BO give a useful basic discussion of operant learning processes, although the stress in this early study is largely on instantaneous conditioning, without the attention to shaping which characterizes Sidman's article. The pigeon example is drawn in part from Skinner, SHB, pp. 63-66 and 91-92. One of the most helpful general articles, also reasonably accessible for those whose scientific training is minimal, is Arthur J. Bachrach, "Some Applications of Operant Conditioning to Behavioral Therapy," in CT, pp. 62-78, which includes a description of the fascinating, not to say hilarious, chained behavior of a white rat called S. R. Rodent, who in a fifteen-second run negotiated or manipulated a spiral staircase, a drawbridge, a ladder, a cable car, another stairway, a toy piano, a gate, a tunnel, an elevator and finally the traditional lever to get his pellet-reinforcement. S. R. Rodent's accomplishment should be of considerable interest to those whose central professional concern is the analysis of vocal and scribal language-chains.</page><page sequence="12">278 COLLEGE ENGLISH a highly articulated humanistic commitment, are repelled by the intrusion of conditioning theories into the educational process, it is perhaps because they tend to associate all conditioning with this Pavlovian, dog-drool kind. While the ultimate philosophical implications of operant conditioning may be the same as those of reflex conditioning (Skinner and most other behaviorists would insist that they are), nevertheless the processes and techniques of operant conditioning are radically different, and therefore may be somewhat more palatable to those concerned with effective pedagogy in such humane areas as English. The differences are four. Most crucially, operant conditioning is not generally concerned with the interiority of the organism. Rather, it is con- cerned with external behavior, and with the central nervous system and skeleto- muscular structures which are the vehicles of that behavior. Second, operant conditioning is response-based rather than stimulus-based: instead of using a coercive external stimulus to elicit behavior, the experimenter simply utilizes emitted segments of the behavioral repertory which the organism already possesses. Third, in the Skinner-box the organism is free in the crucial sense that the experimenter reinforces only those behaviors that the organism freely emits. Fourth, because at least in theory the organism may or may not emit the behavior the experimenter wishes to reinforce, operant conditioning is per- vasively and fundamentally probabilistic, a fact which leaves open certain philo- sophical and methodological doors of crucial concern to the humanist. In short, operant conditioning respects the natural integrity of the organism as classical or Pavlovian conditioning does not. While most scientists would not be com- fortable with such an assertion, it can be said that operant conditioning does no more than influence the behavior of the organism, and that is, after all, what the teaching process is all about.7 IV I have made this digression into the differences between reflex and operant conditioning in the hope that we may now turn with a minimum of philo- sophical disquietude to those principles which underlie Skinner-box learning. There are, more or less, seven such principles: 8 (1) Concentrate on the individual organism (2) Build from the naive behavioral repertory (3) Work with freely emitted behavior (4) Insure high frequency of response (5) Insure low duration of response (6) Reinforce desired responses immediately (7) Shape behavior through intermediate specification of response. 7Accessible discussions of reflex conditioning are W. Horsley Gantt, "Autonomic Con- ditioning," and Howard S. Liddell, "The Challenge of Pavlovian Conditioning and Experimental Neurosis in Animals," both in CT, pp. 115-126 and 127-148. Especially useful for general concepts is Skinner, SHB, pp. 107-128. For a brief discussion of reflex and operant learning as related to specifically verbal problems, see Israel Goldiamond, "Stuttering and Fluency as Manipulatable Operant Response Classes," in RIBM, p. 109 and 109n. 8My seven operant principles are a synthesis of Murray Sidman, "Operant Techniques," in EFCP, pp. 170-210, esp. pp. 172-175; Skinner, SHB, Chs. V, VI, and VII; and most especially Arthur J. Bachrach, "Some Applications of Operant Conditioning to Behavior Therapy," in CT, pp. 62-69.</page><page sequence="13">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 279 I propose to comment on each of these operant principles in turn, and to apply each of them insofar as possible to what seem to me to be the salient characteristics of the present think-write pedagogy in English composition. My justification for this procedure is the self-evident (it seems to me) fact that some sort of behavioral term intervenes between thought on the one hand and the written word on the other, and that therefore behavioral principles such as those derived from Skinner-box experimentation may at least provide us with a suggestive critique of our present think-write instrumental metaphor. I am fully aware that developing such a critique does not in any way help us to meet the anterior and philosophically crucial question of whether principles derived from the learning processes of infrahuman organisms such as the white rat and the pigeon can be either legitimately or effectively applied to the in- finitely more complex learning of human beings. This question I frankly wish to dodge for the moment, asking the reader to content himself with deciding, not whether the following critique is ,theoretically defensible, but only whether it is practically suggestive. Using our seven principles, then, how might a be- havioral scientist view our present think-write pedagogy in English composition? (1) Concentrate on the individual organism. Of immense methodological sig- nificance in operant learning research is the fact that the individual is the subject of systematic investigation. Such individualization contrasts with the group-data techniques which characterize much research in the biological and social sciences, and which involve the obliteration of individual idiosyncrasies and random behavioral deviations through the rendering of the data as statisti- cally derived norms, averages, and medians. In operant research no bit-of- behavior is ever "deviant," "idiosyncratic," or "random": rather, all behavior is empirically significant. To the harried teacher of English composition, fresh from the grinding labor of marking and grading two or three sets of 500-word freshman themes, it will seem painfully obvious that the composition classroom embodies this funda- mental principle of operant learning to a far greater extent than in any other discipline. In no other class, it might be argued, does the student get so much individual attention and response to his individual expression. Only in Englsh composition does the student escape from the reductiveness of the multiple- choice test. Only in English does he get human response to his efforts, rather than the electrical reaction of the scoring machine. Present compositional peda- gogy would appear to be nothing if not individualized. Yet I would argue that the individualization of present compositional peda- gogy is only apparent, and not nearly so closely in consonance with operant learning principles as might at first appear. From a behavioral point of view, whether the learning organism is a white rat or a student, his response is sig- naled by an alteration in the environment. In the case of the white rat, the alteration is mechanical, the simple depressing of a lever. In the case of a stu- dent in English composition, the alteration is artifactual, the production of a scribal "outcome" called a sentence, or a paragraph, or a whole composition. The crucial point to be made is that in the operant learning situation the experi- menter does not focus his attention on the lever which is being depressed; rather, he attends almost entirely to the ongoing behavior of the responding organism which is producing the environmental alteration. In short, what in- dividualizes operant learning is attention to organism, not artifact. This analysis makes it immediately apparent that the parallel between operant</page><page sequence="14">280 COLLEGE ENGLISH individualization and the pedagogical individualization of current composition practice cannot, after all, be sustained. From a rigorously behavioral point of view, the laborious correction of the weekly 500-word theme is the equivalent of focusing all of one's attention on the Skinner-box lever, and almost none on the ongoing, behaving organism that makes the lever meaningful. Indeed, while I have no doubt that the analogy limps, I cannot resist suggest- ing that the universal ritual of theme correction is a little like teaching the lever rather than teaching the white rat-a patently hopeless endeavor. How else is one to account for the legions of students who make the same error in theme after theme despite all our red ink and our elaborate correction charts? If we confuse themes with people, and delude ourselves into thinking that we are giving students individual attention when in fact we are only giving themes individual attention, it is perhaps because our pervasive, largely unconscious think-write metaphor gives sanction to the equivalence of the action of writing with the artifact of written words. But they are not equiva- lent. A behaviorist might wish to insist, indeed, that under our present peda- gogy we are not even, as we habitually claim, teaching writing at all-we only teach written words. In short, the artifactual, product-oriented nature of the think-write pedagogy makes it almost impossible for us to attend in any effective way to whatever behavioral dimension inheres in the scribal act. (2) Build from the naive behavioral repertory. As Arthur J. Bachrach has it, "In the establishment of behavior the experimenter begins with the mass of responses available to the organism" (italics mine)." This means that if the experimenter wishes a pigeon, say, to learn to peck a red plastic disk, he does not withhold food-pellet reinforcement until the pigeon actually pecks the disk. If he waited for such "bullseye" behavior the pigeon would probably starve to death. Instead, the experimenter begins with some bit-of-behavior, such as simple movement in the general direction of the disk, which is part of the pigeon's naive repertory, and shapes the behavioral continuum from that point. Under such procedures, any response of the organism which is even remotely approxi- mate to the desired final behavior is "right": there are no "wrong" responses for the simple reason that the experimenter is always able to find some bit-of- behavior in the behavioral continuum which will provide a viable base for the beginning of a learning sequence. Once again current pedagogical methods in English composition appear to be strikingly out of accord with operant learning principles. The point is best made by scrutinizing the "Correction Chart" which is such a universal feature of composition course handbooks, and which the student encounters in no other course that he takes on either the high school or the college level. It seems fairly obvious that most Correction Charts are not attuned to the approxi- mate "rightness" of what the student has written, but rather to the absolute "wrongness" of the composition. Most Correction Charts make no attempt to tell the student to what extent his writing begins to approximate acceptable English and rhetorical effectiveness, but rather inform him of the unmodu- lated fact that he has missed the bullseye. Our red-ink comments down the margin, based largely on the arcane symbolism of the Chart, put us in the position of shouting "Miss!" at the student, while we wait patiently for him to score a hit (which we do not mark). The student soon learns that we are 9"Some Applications of Operant Conditioning to Behavior Therapy," in CT, p. 68.</page><page sequence="15">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 281 not really interested in approximations of any sort; we are interested only in the production of English on an "acceptable level." We flatly reject that mass of scribal responses which is in fact available to the student at the moment, and to emphasize our rejection we scrawl an "F" on the cover of theme after theme. Only two outcomes are possible under such a pedagogy. First, a few stu- dents achieve some kind of behavioral breakthrough (which as a teacher I must confess I have never understood and refuse to take credit for); they abruptly hit the bullseye after a long series of failures, producing a theme which satisfies the precisionistic norms of the Correction Chart (though having done it once is no guarantee that they will be able to do it again-many stu- dents collapse back into another string of failures). The others, like the pigeon who will get no food unless he actually pecks the disk, never hit the bullseye and starve to death in the course. At the end of the semester we discover that those who passed the course are those who could hit the bullseye with reason- able frequency during the first week. Such a pedagogy, based formally and unabashedly on the articulation of wrongness rather than rightness, clearly runs counter to the second principle of operant learning. (3) Work with freely emitted behavior. We have already touched on this principle in our discussion of reflex and operant conditioning, but the concept will bear restating in somewhat different terms. The point is that the operant experimenter does not demand that the organism respond or behave in a certain way. Rather, he simply waits for whatever response is available to the organism and which it may freely emit. Thus, it is the organism, not the experimenter, which freely supplies the initial datum or bit-of-behavior which is the be- ginning of the learning sequence. Viewed in this light, it is the organism which is free, and the experimenter who is controlled. To what extent does the responding student in English composition have a parallel freedom? Certainly the student enjoys various kinds of behavioral latitude which are not available to him in a mathematics, botany, or history course. In composition he is often allowed to pick his own topic and respond to it in his own way. Even in those instances where we assign the topic and indicate a general line of attack, he is still free to follow his own bent and solve the rhetorical problem by whatever means seem best to him. It appears, therefore, that there is considerable coincidence between operant principles of free behavioral emission and current practice in English composition. But this freedom is a trifle deceptive, for two reasons. In the first place, our theme-centered pedagogy is not actually based on a response, but rather on a response-aggregate: that is what a theme is. Second, even in the early stages of the course we insist that this sustained response-aggregate be structured in various complex ways. We force the student above the "natural" level of imme- diate utterance and simple sentence to a level where he must attend to topic sentences, clear transitions, introductions and conclusions. In the extreme (but certainly not uncommon) case we ask the student who really cannot yet produce an effective sentence nevertheless to deliver the sort of outline which Aquinas himself would find a challenge. In short, even before the student makes any re- sponse to an assignment, we impose upon the theme he has yet to write a macronormative structure invisible to him, to which he must conform. Our stress on a-structured response-aggregate makes it impossible for him to respond with freedom initially-or at any other point-out of his scribal repertory.</page><page sequence="16">282 COLLEGE ENGLISH (4) Insure high frequency of response. While there is in operant conditioning such a thing as instantaneous learning, the shaping process is based on the assumption that the organism will have innumerable opportunities to respond. The experimenter uses this multi-trial situation to shape the organism by succes- sive approximations toward the desired terminal behavior. There is nothing arcane about this learning principle: the golfer who works on his wood shots by going through three or four buckets of balls on the driving range is simply placing himself in a high response-frequency situation which is not available on the actual course, where no more than one wood shot per hole is likely. All human skills are learned in high response-frequency situations. All but rhetorical and compositional skills, that is. Indeed, if a professional golfer were to teach his skill as we often teach ours, he would simply send his students around an eighteen-hole course a dozen or so times in a four- month "semester," without any other kind of practice, and evince considerable disappointment if his pupils were not shooting in the low nineties at the end of the twelve-trial period. Nor would he bother to accompany a particular student as he ran the course, observing and commenting upon the student's ongoing behavior. Rather, he would simply sit in a deck chair at the eighteenth hole, ready to scribble a grade and brief comment on the score-cards of those who actually made it back before sundown. I do not think that this analogy does a substantial injustice to our present compositional pedagogy: our per- vasive textual bias, our insistence on structured response-aggregates, our con- cern with the written word rather than writing, all result in a twelve-theme-a- semester pedagogy which violates not only the response-frequency principle of operant learning theory, but also thousands of years of common human experience in the development of essential skills. (5) Insure low duration of response. The processes of shaping and chaining demand, not sustained or complex responses, but rather responses which are consistently both brief and simple in relation to the organism's response reper- tory at that level. Ferster points out that the Skinner-box apparatus "generates a response which takes a short time to occur and leaves the animal in the same place ready to respond again" (italics mine).1o In the verbal-vocal world, of course, such a low-duration response is likely to turn out to be the linguist's free utterance, which can be measured in seconds, which seldom takes para- graph form, and which most certainly will never achieve a magic five hundred words if transcribed. Yet despite the hints which linguistic research gives us in this area, we cling to a pedagogy based simplistically on high-duration response-aggregates, the quantitative and structural aspects of which conflict seriously with our simultaneous concern for quality of utterance. (6) Reinforce desired responses immediately. In shaping the behavior of in- frahuman organisms, for which only present time has any reality, it is necessary for the experimenter to reinforce the desired behavioral "bit" with great alacrity, lest some other segment of behavior intervene between the response and the reinforcement, distorting the shaping process. To state the principle anthropomorphically, the organism is never at a loss as to his progress; the reinforcement mechanism is so timed that the animal "knows" immediately when he is "moving along." The human organism, of course, has something going for him here that S. R. Rodent does not-a sophisticated time-sense 10C. B. Ferster, "The Use of the Free Operant in the Analysis of Behavior," Psychological Bulletin, L (July, 1953), 263.</page><page sequence="17">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 283 which makes it possible to live in both past and future time. He can, there- fore, profit by his instructor's marginal comments and make a reasoned assess- ment of a scribal performance now two weeks in the past. But such an assessment is historical, not behavioral, textual rather than scribal. This accounts for the innumerable students who tell their composition instructor, "I can see what I did wrong on last week's theme when you mark the mistake, but when I sit down to write this week's theme I make the same mistake all over again any- way." The weekly theme, often written in the privacy of a dormitory room, is little more than a series of shots in the dark at an invisible bullseye. Illumina- tion, if it comes at all, comes two weeks later, and by that time the student is presumably involved in another and uniquely different scribal act. In short, our present pedagogy, and the think-write metaphor which undergirds it, take little account of the fact that while students can most certainly think in the past, they can behave only in the present. (7) Shape behavior through intermediate specification of response. In operant learning final behavior is not achieved in one great leap, but rather involves a multi-trial process where each response represents a successively closer ap- proximation of the terminal behavior. Such successive approximations can be achieved only if the experimenter can, at all stages of the learning sequence, specify the precise nature of the next approximate response he wishes the organism to emit. With infrahuman organisms the establishment of this sched- ule of sub-specifications is relatively easy: the experimenter first wants the animal to move, then move in the general direction of the manipulandum, then in the immediate proximity of the lever, then touch the lever, and finally de- press it. But as Arthur J. Bachrach points out, "On a more complex human level the demands for specification are no less real and no less important."" It is this question of constant response-specification which most vividly high- lights the inherent difficulties of compositional and rhetorical pedagogy, difficul- ties which separate it not only from other essentially intellective academic dis- ciplines, but also from most other common skill situations. The skier must lean forward further as he goes into the fall-line on his next turn; the golfer must incorporate more wrist flexure into his next swing; the pianist must achieve more precise syncopation of right hand with the left on his next course through a difficult passage-specification of successive approximations in these entirely physical instances presents few problems. Nor is specification an insuperable problem in academic disciplines other than English: the student coping with a problem in calculus has a limited number of routes to the answer available to him, all of them illustrated in the text. The zoology student, confronting a laboratory frog, can take comfort from the fact that amphibian anatomy large- ly dictates dissection protocol. On the other hand, if we assert (and we frequently do) that composition and rhetoric constitute an art, and that the composition student confronts problems no different from those which the painter or the architectural student must confront, we overlook the fact that while the student-writer must conform to norms of "acceptable English" and "rhetorical effectiveness," students in other more obviously artistic disciplines are not so bound. There is no such thing as "standard architecture," much less "acceptable brush technique." The core of the pedagogical difficulty for the teacher of composition is therefore not the lack of an ultimate or terminal specification, but rather the 11"Some Applications of Operant Conditioning to Behavior Therapy," in CT, p. 65.</page><page sequence="18">284 COLLEGE ENGLISH fact that it is ultimate and, under the rubric of our present instrumental meta- phor, intractably so. Any approximation, any sub-specification, is in most cur- rent pedagogy sub-standard; it is therefore never to be utilized according to the operant demand for intermediate specification, but only rejected. Indeed, only in English composition is the student confronted with an invisible, arche- typal specification called "Good Writing" which, apparently, can never be approximated either distantly or closely, but only achieved. Students, of course, resent this invisibility: this is why they constantly ask us to tell them "what we really want" on a theme assignment. In an effort to make the archetype visible and the specification accessible, we offer the student readings by publishing writers, a time-honored technique of great usefulness which is nevertheless somewhat limited by the fact that the scribal artifact is always unique, and that the unique rhetorical solutions evolved by the model writer are of circumscribed efficacy in helping the puzzled student to cope with his own compositional problem, also entirely unique. Here we see clearly the pervasive historicity of the think-write metaphor. Model readings, useful though they are, represent the product of the scribal act, not the act itself. The conclusion from all of this seems reasonably obvious: the central failure of current compositional pedagogy-and the point at which it diverges most radically from the suggestive principles of operant learning theory-is its apparent inability to furnish the student-writer with anything but the most generalized specifications for getting from one side of the writing situation to the other. What is urgently needed is a pedagogical technique which will supply the student-writer with a set of compositional specifications which are (a) successively intermediate rather than ultimate, (b) visible rather than in- visible, (c) uniquely adapted to the student's unique writing problem, and (d) behavioral rather than historical, addressed to writing rather than the written word. In concluding this critique, it is relevant to ask if our present compositional pedagogy resembles any learning process recognized in psychological research. The answer, of course, is yes. To a distressing degree, the twelve-theme-a- semester approach resembles that division of "selective" or "trial-and-error" learning best typified by the T-maze, where the organism is reinforced if it turns, say, to the right, but not if it turns to the left. The essence of trial-and- error learning is the establishment of a hierarchy of responses, one of which is "right" and all the rest "wrong." This stands, of course, in sharp contrast to operant learning techniques, where there are no "wrong" responses, but only those responses which are reinforced differentially.12 But it should be pointed out that we demand much more of our composition students than the box-maze experimenter ever asks of his white rats. S. R. Rodent has only to run the maze which the experimenter has built for him, and presumably the experimenter knows what he's doing. Composition instruc- tors, on the other hand, following a simplistically intellective pedagogy to its logical conclusion, often demand not only that the student run a rhetorical maze, but that he first construct, by means of a do-it-yourself outline, the maze he is to run. Unless the student is so proficient that he probably should not be in the course anyway, he will then undergo the salutary experience of badly 12For a discussion of the differences between trial-and-error and operant learning, see Kenneth W. Spence, Behavior Theory and Conditioning (New Haven, 1956), pp. 25-53.</page><page sequence="19">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 285 running a badly constructed and perhaps pointless maze, and the instructor will be able to establish the student's wrongness, not once, but twice. V The reader must not conclude from this analysis of current compositional pedagogy that I am in favor of throwing out everything we are presently doing and starting over from scratch. I take no such black-and-white position. For one thing, my critique is based on a central oversimplification which I have tolerated in order to make my point. That oversimplification, of course, centers on the assumption that multi-trial operant learning is the only relevant kind, not only for the infrahuman organism, but for the human organism as well. But this is untrue: there are many other kinds of learning, some of which we are presently using to great advantage, and one of which I will wish to discuss later in this study. Therefore: I do not think our present intellective pedagogy is wrong. I only think it is too simple. I would retain the present rhetorical emphasis, the present long theme, the present analytical use of read- ings by model writers-I would even tolerate the outline-but on these estab- lished devices I would superimpose a behavioral element based on operant learn- ing principles. Objections to this superimposition will take two forms. One will arise from that arrogant humanism-perhaps better termed superhumanism or meta- naturalism-which asserts that Nature's noblest work can hardly be expected to learn anything from the lowly white rat. Since such a position can be maintained only by the assiduous cultivation of total ignorance of current research in the biological and behavioral sciences, it is hardly worth the page- space it would take to refute it. The other objection is much more substantive, and must be met. It asserts that the evolutionary position and behavioral capacity of the human organism are so many orders of magnitude beyond those of the white rat, the pigeon, or the higher primates that extrapolation from any of the latter to the former is scientifically untenable, involving us in what Andrew Salter calls "Pavlomorphism," that is, "endow[ing] human beings with dog-like characteristics." C. M. Franks as- serts that while "Conditioning has been shown to be possible over the gamut of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic scales, from simple snaillike creatures to man, from the fetal stage to the geriatric," nevertheless it is "usually not possible to make very meaningful inter- and intraspecies comparisons.. .." Pavlov himself, Franks continues, "frequently cautioned against the uncritical and premature transfer of conclusions from one species to another." Indeed, Frederick H. Kanfer points out that the Skinner-box rat is such a coddled, protected, and specialized creature that "it is doubtful that much of our rat psychology is ap- plicable even to the field mouse, much less to the adult human!" B. F. Skinner, however, is not put off by such difficulties: The use of this material [infrahuman data] often meets with the objection that there is an essential gap between man and the other animals, and that the results of one cannot be extrapolated to the other. To insist upon this discontinuity at the beginning of a scientific investigation is to beg the question. Human behavior is distinguished by its complexity, its variety, and its greater accomplishments, but the basic processes are not therefore necessarily different.13 13Salter, "The Theory and Practice of Conditioned Reflex Therapy," in CT, p. 22: Franks, "Individual Differences in Conditioning and Associated Techniques," in CT, p. 155; Kanfer,</page><page sequence="20">286 COLLEGE ENGLISH It would, however, be entirely foolhardy for the teacher of English to assume a competence in an area where the scientists themselves are at least theoretically uncertain. The solution, of course, is to follow Kanfer's distinction between "simple extrapolation" on the one hand and "separate experimentation" on the other, so that one utilizes infrahuman data, not to develop a dogmatically rigid, simplistically extrapolative pedagogy, but rather a speculative model, in con- sonance with learning theory, which will be subject to experimental verification and modification in the classroom. Such a methodology takes the teacher of English neatly off the hook, and leaves the difficult question of interspecific extrapolation to the scientists who are competent to handle it. In the present state of the art, there-is considerable sanction for such speculative models, which Skinner calls "exercises in interpretation,"14 in all major areas of human activity. Models of a largely theoretical sort are Skinner's Science and Human Behavior and, of much more interest to the teacher of English, his Verbal Behavior."' But the work currently being done which is most fertile of practical suggestions for a new compositional pedagogy is embodied in the clinical and experimental (as distinguished from theoretical) models for the modification of human be- havior being developed in the relatively new field of behavioral and socio- behavioral psychotherapy.'6 The simplest way to describe the difference between behavioral psychotherapy and the older psychologies is to assert, with some danger of oversimplification, that all present psychologies have a philosophical heritage going back through Freud. The single exception is the behavioral psychologies, the intellectual heritage of which is pervasively biological rather than philosophical, going back through Pavlov. As a consequence, most present psychologies are internalist and mentalis- tic, with the exception of the behavioral school, which is externalist and physio- logical. The older psychologies take off from mind; behavioral psychology takes off from matter. In terms of the historical development of pedagogical theory in the field of English the distinction is of great, if generally unexamined, importance. Insofar as psychology has impinged on English literature and literary criticism, and penetrated the graduate schools which deal with these fields, it is the Freudian psychology or some derivative thereof which has done both the impinging and the penetrating. Indeed, I venture to say that it is virtually impossible to go through an American graduate school in pursuit of an advanced degree in English without absorbing, sometimes consciously but more often unconsciously, the -philosophical assumptions underlying all of the mentalistic psychologies which have developed since Freud. While such an assertion is bound to bring "Vicarious Reinforcement: A Glimpse Into the Black Box," in RIBM, p. 248; Skinner, SHB, p. 38. 14Skinner, VB, p. 11. 15For the rigorist who will insist that I am making an interspecific leap despite these demurrers, let me at least make the point-which will inevitably sound churlish in view of my obvious debts-that my extrapolation (if such it is) is rodential rather than Skinnerian. An extrapolation either from or through Skinner immediately involves the teacher of English in the question of the validity of Skinner's own extrapolations (if such they be), especially the tact-mand schema of Verbal Behavior-which I do not find entirely convincing. S. R. Rodent is much less complicated; I prefer to go directly to him. 16The best recent overview of the field is Albert Bandura, "Behavioral Psychotherapy," Scientific American, CCXVI (March, 1967), 78-86. It was this very suggestive article which led to the present study.</page><page sequence="21">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 287 wrathful denials down on my head, I will go further and assert that many college and high school teachers of English are at the present time functionally if not conceptually unaware that any psychology other than a mentalistic one is possible. Even where one sometimes encounters behavioral terminology or con- cepts in the current literature, a close reading generally reveals that these have been imposed on a mentalistic substrate with a grand disregard for philosoph- ical or functional consistency. The direct, overt influence of this situation on English literature and literary criticism is obvious; even today it is virtually impossible to assemble a graduate seminar in either of these fields without turning up at least one wild-eyed Freudian or Jungian in hot pursuit of steeples, water-images, and trains-going- through-tunnels. Such grotesqueries, even when embalmed in Ph.D. disserta- tions, need not detain us. But what should give us pause is the possibility that the pervasive mentalism of these psychologies has had an invisible and largely unconscious influence on the teaching of English composition. I do not, of course, suggest that present compositional pedagogy is Freudian, or Jungian, or Adlerian; what we do in composition is clearly derived from older bodies of thought which developed long before psychology reared its protean head. What I do suggest is that the psychologies we English teachers know-or per- haps in some cases just know of-have provided us with a contemporary, semi- scientific sanction for the exclusively intellective think-write metaphor which shaped the older rhetoric and which shapes ours today. Such an analysis can perhaps account for the obvious difficulty we appear to encounter in thinking of composition and the pedagogical problems it presents in any but mentalistic terms. 17 And indeed, the correlations between the intellective psychologies and our compositional pedagogy are very striking. All psychodynamic psychologies, 17The most recent and interesting example of this pervasive mentalism is John Dixon's redaction of the Anglo-American Dartmouth Conference in Growth Through English (Reading, England, 1967). For Dixon (and I take it he expresses the approximate con- sensus of the Conference), men order, but they are never ordered. "As pupils talk, write, and read in English lessons," he asserts, "they are structuring experience" (p. 74). Under such a view, "...language [is] used in bringing things to order" (p. 74), and students can be taught to see themselves "as organizers of experience in the act of speaking and writing..." (p. 77). The mentalism implicit in this view of things comes clear as Dixon quotes from the diary of a ten-year-old boy describing two rainy and cold April days at a poplar pond studying newts. As Dixon sees it, the boy's use of language in his diary is a kind of neo-Emersonian, quasi-Coleridgean imposition of order upon the external world and his experience of it. The mind, through lan- gauge, orders: "Using language in [the boy's] case means selecting some things for scrutiny and bringing things into order" (pp. 4-5). This is, it seems to me, a very polarized view of the situation. Surely it is just as reasonable to assert that the youngster's diary, rather than being an example of the mind ordering, is instead an example of the mind being ordered, being structured by reality rather than the other way around, by the tactile force of April rain and poplar pond and spotted newt. The point is important because Mr. Dixon and his Dartmouth colleagues appear to have attended almost entirely to the experience of ordering, and hardly at all to the experience of being ordered. Quite predictably, the pedagogy that emerges places great stress on subjectivity, creativity, and a sort of crypto- Wordsworthian aestheticism which assumes that all children can and should be moved by trees swaying in the wind, by the odor of roses, or by the way "a huddle of ducklings bob over the ripples on the pond" (p. 48). In short, the mentalistic thrust of Growth Through English gives us a pedagogy which would turn all children into faculty children, an outcome that I for one can only view with horror.</page><page sequence="22">288 COLLEGE ENGLISH for example, are pervasively dualistic, positing two distinct entities called "mind" and "body." "Mind," under this schema, is actually a "mental apparatus" in- volving such mechanisms as imagination, understanding, and will. Certain con- ceptual models or instrumental metaphors are then superimposed on this gener- alized formulation. Topographical models, for example, are typified by Freud's Id-Ego-Super Ego geography. An hydraulic conceptual model is apparent in the ideas of expression, repression, and sublimation. A force or vector metaphor is manifest in the almost universal assumption that the mind in some sense contains "psychodynamic agents" or dynamistically conceived "psychic con- ditions": Freudians work with empirically inaccessible abstractions such as penis-envy, castration fear, and the Oedipus complex; Adlerians stress power strivings and inferiority feelings; Rogerians focus on internal self-concepts which are "inappropriate." To the psychoanalyst, these are all "concealed forces"; to those who do not accept the psychodynamic view of personality, they constitute the "demonology" apparent in all Freud-derived psychologies. Finally, almost without exception, the various psychodynamic schools are historicist in their methodology: it is assumed that all present psychic dysfunctions can be accounted for in terms of the past history of the patient. Therapy is therefore almost always based on the resurrection of psychically significant past events and the development of "insight" into the shaping influence these events have exercised. More important than any of these models, however, is the conceptual metaphor based on physical medicine, and on the medical dichotomy between underlying disease and overt symptom. Without significant exception, Freud and all his followers and apostates assume that aberrant external behavior is merely the symptom of an underlying psychic condition operating as cause. Following the analogue of physical medicine quite literally, they assume that a "cure" can be effected, not by attacking the surface symptom, but rather the hidden psychic dysfunction. Eliminate the mental "disease," in short, and the symptoms will automatically disappear. This is, moreover, a unidirectional process: there is no room in most psychodynamic theory for an attack on the symptom and indeed, it is widely assumed that eliminating the symptom without getting at the underlying cause is a dangerous procedure: the psychic disease survives intact, and is almost certain to "pop out" in some other, displaced form of aberrant behavior at a later date. VI Now, nearly all of this theory (some would prefer to call it mythology) finds its parallel in the think-write pedagogy which dominates current practice in English composition. Most striking, of course, is the medical analogy. I overgeneralize only mildly in asserting that awkward, jumbled, opaque, and ineffective writing is conceived by many English teachers as nothing more than a symptom, the outer sign of an inner psychic condition operating as cause. And we further assume that the underlying cause, invisible and inaccessible though it is, can be described precisely: it is awkward, jumbled, opaque, and ineffective thought. It follows as night follows day that if we can improve the quality of thought, eliminating the psychic dysfunction by somehow endowing the thought with logic, organization, sequence, precision, lucidity, and succinctness, we will there-</page><page sequence="23">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 289 upon and quite automatically improve the quality of the written word which is the "expression" of that thought. Moreover, this whole sequence is dynamistically conceived: it is significant that the gerunds "thinking" and "writing" are con- joined in so many catalog course-descriptions, as if there were some psychological and/or physiological servomechanism linking the two, with visible "writing" as the dial-plate to the invisible activity of "thinking." This is the substance of our simplistic pedagogy, totally internalist, entirely intellective. Just as striking is the historical dimension of the think-write pedagogy. As psychoanalysis is centered on achieving "insight" or "self-knowledge" with regard to past psychic events, so also is our present compositional pedagogy overwhelmingly post hoc in its orientation. We are not much interested in what the student is writing; we are very much interested in what he has written. When we mark and grade a theme, we do so in the hope that the student will achieve "self-knowledge" or "insight" into a psychological or mental sequence of events now far down the stream of time. And an even more crucial assumption, bordering indeed on an act of faith, is that which asserts that the student will actually be able to bring whatever inferences he derives from this post hoc assessment to bear in a fruitful way on present or future scribal performances. Of all the parallels between psychodynamic theory and compositional peda- gogy, however, the most interesting is the unidirectional nature of both meth- odologies. The psychoanalyst assumes always that psychic malfunction comes first as cause, and external aberrant behavior second as effect. Similarly, the teacher of English, dominated by the think-write instrumental metaphor (which is perhaps better written think--write), assumes that faulty thought always comes first as cause, and faulty writing second as effect. There is nothing in either methodology to give sanction to the possibility that the process may operate in the reverse direction, or both directions at once. Our present pedagogy generally excludes any consideration of the possibilities of either thinks--write or think;__write. It is precisely at this point that behavioral psychotherapy, with its clinical methodologies derived from operant learning principles, opens up new directions for the development of a radically different compositional pedagogy. Its sug- gestiveness for the teacher of English resides in one incandescent, lucidly simple fact: it shifts the locus of methodological attention from the inner activity of the organism, which is invisible and empirically inaccessible, to the outer activity of the organism, which is visible and empirically observable. It does not necessarily deny the existence of thought or various other kinds of inner states; it simply faces the fact that the interior life of the organism is beyond our effective reach.18 Consequently it directs its efforts, not to the establishment of right thinking, but rather of right behaving. It abandons entirely the disease-and-its-symptoms model drawn from physical medicine; it assumes that aberrant or maladaptive behavior, the external act, is not simply the overt manifestation of an internal dysfunction, but rather the dysfunction itself. For methodological purposes it posits external behavior- tactile, accessible, measurable, manipulatable-as the only reality. The result is the effective exorcism of the mentalistic demonology of the older psychologies: the whole quasi-mythological tissue of complexes, urges, appetites, drives, and compulsions is simply obliterated. In its place the behavioral psychologist sub- 18I of course oversimplify; rapid advances in instrumentation begin to make certain kinds of inner activity observable-but only in quantified form.</page><page sequence="24">290 COLLEGE ENGLISH stitutes the environmental event, manipulated according to principles derived directly from Skinner-box learning theory and impinging on the organism as a stimulus which generates a desired or "adaptive" response. The result is not "insight," but, quite simply, behavior modification.19 The way all this works in actual practice is vividly illustrated by the different approaches to stuttering taken by the psychodynamic and behavioral schools. Stuttering is a particularly suggestive problem, since if the compositional process is viewed behaviorally, then the vocal non-fluencies which comprise stuttering may just conceivably have some functional, diagnostic, or remedial connection to the scribal non-fluencies that the English teacher encounters in the classroom. The therapist trained in psychodynamic theory and psychoanalytical procedures will see the act of stuttering as simply a symptom of an underlying dynamic agent which he will probably label anxiety. He assumes that the anxiety is the cause of the stuttering, and he mounts an attack on this non-observable phenomenon, probing the patient's psyche for the historical sources of the present anxiety. Hopefully, the patient's achievement of insight and retro- spective awareness will relieve the anxiety and reduce the stutter to socially acceptable levels. But such an approach ignores the possibility that the anxiety is caused by the stuttering, instead of the other way around; it is to this possibility that the behavioral psychotherapist addresses himself. Taking an entirely ahistorical approach, ignoring both originating circumstance and present psychic condition, he simply attempts to reduce the stuttering itself using various externalist pro- cedures, such as subjecting the patient to a mild faradic shock at the occurrence of each non-fluency. Obviously, such a line of attack gives the behavioral therapist a massive procedural advantage: by confining himself to the exter- nalized behavior of stuttering, he is able to direct his full attention to events which are observable, measurable, and manipulatable. At no point is he forced to deal with invisible and abstractive psychic entities. The clinical evidence is that such an approach often works: not only does externalized stimulus manipulation reduce and frequently eliminate the stuttering; a diminution in stuttering behavior is accompanied by a reduction in anxiety. This total reversal of the classical cause-and-effect sequence leads George Saslow to assert "that there is no reason to think that the sequence of insight... and behavior alteration must always go in one direction. It is accepted in fields outside psychiatry, apparently much more easily than within it, that, although feelings, ideas and sentiments can lead to new actions, actions can lead to new feelings, ideas and sentiments just as w~ell. There is no compelling evidence that the sequence works only in one direction" (italics mine).20 19oTwo of the most useful brief comparisons of psychoanalytical and behavioral theory are Arthur J. Bachrach, "Some Applications of Operant Conditioning to Behavior Therapy," in CT, pp. 62-64; and Albert Bandura, "Behavioral Psychotherapy," p. 78. Relevant to the issue but outside the province of this study is the question of the effectiveness of psychoanalytical as compared to behavioral methodologies. For a general discussion of the latter in relation to the former see Joseph Wolpe, "The Comparative Clinical Status of Conditioning Therapies and Psychoanalysis," in CT, pp. 5-20; also H. J. Eysenck, "Behavior Therapy: Unlearning Neurosis," and "Behavior Therapy: Technique and Evaluation," both in Medical Opinion and Review, III (January, 1967), 68-74, and III (February, 1967), 61-67. I am grateful to Thomas Ryan, M.D., for calling these two articles to my attention. o20srael Goldiamond, "Stuttering and Fluency as Operant Response Classes," in RIBM, p. 154n; George Saslow, "A Case History of Attempted Behavior Modification in a Psychiatric Ward," in RIBM, pp. 288-289.</page><page sequence="25">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 291 Such a massive reconceptualization of the relationship between thought and action, between the inner world and the outer world, should, it seems to me, induce a shock of recognition in any teacher of English whose dogged efforts to get students to think more clearly have been accompanied by an increasing sense of futility and pedagogical angst. One stands rapt in wild surmise before the possibility that better writing need not be preceded by better thought, that indeed better writing may be the necessary prerequisite to better thought, and that some, much, or all of the improvement that we do observe in a student's scribal performance may have its source in non-intellective areas. We have all told students, a trifle piously I fear, that the only way to learn to write is to write; behavioral theory suggests that there is a great deal more implied in this maxim than the simplistic ideas of repetition and practice. VII Such a reversal of pedagogical polarity, however, is only a beginning. Re- conceptualization is one thing; translation of that reconceptualization into viable classroom practice quite another. The problem has two parts: (a) how does one structure a pedagogy directed to action rather than to thought, and (b) how does one incorporate into such an experimental pedagogical model the concepts of reinforcement, successive approximation, specification of response, and extinction which have been developed in infrahuman learning studies? Fortunately for the teacher of English, the learning theorists and behavioral psychotherapists have been busy in recent years constructing innumerable ex- perimental models, mostly for clinical use, many of which may conceivably be of considerable help in visualizing new pedagogical directions in English composition. As one might expect, behavioral experimentation has achieved many of its most unequivocal successes so far with children, for the simple reason that the behavioral repertory of both normal and abnormal children is much more limited and much more plastic than that of adults. At the same time, behavioral modifica- tion in children illustrates the application of the various principles of learning and conditioning theory much more incisively and vividly than the same prin- ciples applied to the adult. I do not wish to suggest that human children are much closer to the white rat than human adults-but something like that. A particularly illustrative example of such child-focused experimental models is the apparatus-a sort of human Skinner-box-developed by Arthur W. Staats, who is here concerned with the learning processes involved in reading. A child sits before a box-like structure, confronted by a configuration of plexiglass panels. When a "letter stimulus" appears on an upper panel, the child must match this stimulus by making a choice among three other stimulus panels located below the first. His response, which parallels the depressing of the lever-manipulandum by the white rat, consists in pressing the plexiglass panel he has chosen. If his choice is correct the apparatus immediately delivers a response-contingent reinforcement which is essentially identical with the food- pellet delivered by the magazine in the infrahuman Skinner-box: a "dispenser" automatically drops a colored marble in a tray near the child's right hand. At this point Staats exploits the fact that the naive behavioral repertory of the child is infinitely greater than that of the white rat by making the marble- reinforcement the basis of a "token economy." The child has a choice as to what</page><page sequence="26">292 COLLEGE ENGLISH he will do with his marble. To his left is a "Universal Feeder" equipped with a funnel: if the child drops his marble in the funnel, the feeder delivers a trinket or a piece of candy, either of which presumably sends the youngster back to the plexiglass panels, reinforced and ready for another reading lesson. Or he may save up his marbles by depositing them in plexiglass tubes of varying capacity, to each of which is attached a toy of a value commensurate with the size of the tube-the bigger the tube, the better the toy. When the tube is finally filled with marbles-an outcome which demands the matching of innumerable letter- stimulus panels under a marble-economy schedule of constant stimulus- specification and response reinforcement-the child collects the toy. While still entirely experimental, this rigidly Skinnerian apparatus has been fairly suc- cessful: Staats asserts that in individual cases he has been able to teach "the essentials of reading" with considerable rapidity to youngsters just over three years old.21 Just as striking and much less literalistically mechanistic is the application of differential reinforcement and shaping procedures by Staats and William H. Butterfield to the case of a fourteen-year-old delinquent boy who, in addition to having a long history of aggressive, destructive behavior, had never received a passing grade in eight and a half years of school, and who read at the second grade level. He was considered to be, at the time that he became a subject of experimental behavior modification, uneducable, incorrigible, and mentally re- tarded. What is of particular significance is the fact that in this case no apparatus was involved. Rather, the principles of operant learning were brought to bear in a free-floating and therefore pedagogically much more viable way in which the patient becomes a learner and the therapist becomes a teacher as well as a source of token and social reinforcement. Under the direction of Staats and Butterfield, the therapist (actually a pro- bation officer) undertook to shape the behavior of the delinquent youngster in a way analogous to that already described by Murray Sidman and others in the shaping of infrahuman behavior. That is, the therapist selectively reinforced certain segments of the behavioral continuum which were of social value, immediate or approximate, and to not reinforce-or reinforce negatively-other segments which were part of the aggression-and-destruction syndrome. Specif- ically, the therapist undertook to teach the boy to read-first single words, then sentences, and finally brief stories. For each word the boy learned immediate reinforcement was forthcoming: he received points that he saved and exchanged for phonograph records and other things that he wanted. Albert Bandura, reporting on the case, asserts that "In four and a half months he made notable advances in reading-test scores. Moreover, the brief treatment program produced generalized educational and psychological effects: he received passing grades in all his subjects for the first time and his aggressively defiant behavior ceased."22 In developing such experimental models, the experimenter steadfastly views the bit-of-behavior he wishes to alter as a learned habit, the alteration of which involves "reconditioning"; thus, Joseph Wolpe defines behavior therapy as "the technique of habit change." The most essential element in the process is the development of a sharply articulated specification for the terminal behavior one 21"A Case in and a Strategy For the Extension of Learning Principles to Problems of Human Behavior," in RIBM, pp. 27-55; an illustration of the reading apparatus appears on p. 35. 22"Behavioral Psychotherapy," Scientific American, CCXVI (March 1967), p. 81.</page><page sequence="27">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 293 wishes to achieve. Staats suggests what such specifications might be in child- behavior: "It is stimulating to us, and a momentous step," he remarks, "to extinguish temper tantrums, or shape walking versus crawling, or shape going to bed at night without a fuss, or the striking of a target in a previously useless arm." The imaginative application of operant learning principles-such as successive approximation-once such a specification is developed, is illustrated by the case of a schizophrenic three-and-one-half year old named Dicky who had undergone a series of operations on both eyes for cataracts. As reported by Sidney W. Bijou, the specification was "to reduce [Dicky's] severe emotional disturbances ... and to train him to wear glasses through the systematic application of behavior principles": Shaping procedures were used to get Dicky to wear his glasses. The initial step was to place lensless frames around the room. He was reinforced for picking them up, hold- ing them, and carrying them. He was reinforced for bringing the frames closer to his eyes by successive approximations. It was found necessary to use food as reinforcers and to conduct training sessions prior to meal times, using the meal for training. Before the shaping process began, Dicky was virtually uncontrollable, his behavior characterized by head-banging, pulling his own hair, frantically scratch- ing his own face; at the end of the shaping process, sufficient self-control had been shaped into Dicky so that he was consistently wearing his glasses about twelve hours a day.23 To the college or high school teacher of English who every day confronts class after class of pink-cheeked, clear-eyed adolescents or young adults who are if anything (one sometimes feels) too well-balanced, too well-adjusted, and entirely too complacent, such experimental behavioral studies, directed to gross personality distortions, may seem at first glance to have little if any relevance to compositional pedagogy. And of course, certain aspects of the experimental models, such as the use of token and food reinforcement, give the skeptical English teacher, who already has a professionally developed taste for parody, the opportunity to reduce the entire methodology to absurdity. It is all too easy to imagine row upon row of vitamin-stuffed college freshmen enrolled in something called Rodential Composition I, each equipped (as a wag in the physiology department here recently suggested) with a Disneyesque "Mouse- keteer" hat, each scribbling sentences on some sort of Skinnerian blackboard equipped to deliver a candy-bar reinforcement, say, when the student's scribal behavior reaches a certain level of rhetorical effectiveness. My sense of parody is also professionally developed, and I have no objection to the more risibly skeptical of my colleagues getting their jollies in this manner, so long as they also see that such experimental models offer fertile suggestions for the kinds of strategies which may be employed in making-not an extrapolation-but an extension (Staats' word) of learning principles to the English classroom. And indeed the now very extensive literature on the shaping and conditioning of specifically verbal behavior is not, I think, subject to such parodic treatment. While confined almost entirely to verbal-vocal behavior because of the clinical psychologist's preoccupation with the therapeutic interview technique, current 23"Experimental Studies in Child Behavior, Normal and Deviant," in RIBM, pp. 676-678.</page><page sequence="28">294 COLLEGE ENGLISH experimentation in verbal conditioning is nonetheless very suggestive of new angles of attack for the teacher of composition. Once again the behavioral view demands a radical reorientation of the instru- mental metaphors we use to think about verbal activity. The traditional men- talistic view, implicit in the think-write instrumental metaphor (and which even the early behaviorists accepted), is that the verbal emission constitutes a "report," or "signal," or "index" to a "more significant psychological process" taking place "inside" the individual. Viewed in this way, verbal activity is important only insofar as it is related to, or provides data concerning, the psychodynamic world of attitudes, feelings, and thoughts. Logically enough, if one wishes to alter the verbal emission, one must somehow make an attack on this mentalistic world which it presumably mirrors.24 In sharp contrast, the behavioral psychotherapist attacks the verbal emission itself, on the assumption that it is a response to some environmental event, rather than a "signal" from the interiority of the organism. He assumes that modification of verbal behavior can be brought about simply by manipulating such environmental events, with no reference to the mental processes of the subject. Or, as Leonard Krasner has it, "Verbal conditioning is the system- atic application of social reinforcements to influence the probability of another person emitting a specifiable verbal behavior."25 Here, as in other behavioral work, such specification of response is of crucial importance. To reduce the multiple aspects of verbal behavior to manageable units, the experimenter develops specifiable "response classes," each class being made up of responses which are more or less interchangeable in a given stimulus situation. In the early experimental phase the concentration was on sharply defined word-classes or grammatical and/or logical characteristics: thus, the experimenter might aim at altering the frequency of emission of plural nouns, or "food words," or certain numbers in vocalized numerical sequences. In the later studies, the response classes are much more functional: the experimenter or psychotherapist attempts to manipulate the emission of "emotional words," "positive self-reference statements," "negative self-reference statements," "con- fiding responses," "neurotic verbalizations," "affiliative statements," or "expres- sions of opinion or beliefs."26 Once such categories are established, the experimenter can then attempt to increase or decrease the frequency with which his subject emits a given class of verbal responses by applying (or failing to apply) social reinforcement. "The examiner," Leonard Krasner explains, "uses his own behavior systemat- ically to cue the subject. These cues indicate that the examiner is listening, paying attention, perhaps even approving of what the subject is saying." In purely experimental studies, this may mean the almost mathematically precise 24Kurt Salzinger, "Experimental Manipulation of Verbal Behavior: A Review," The Journal of General Psychology, LXI (1959), 65. While now almost a decade old, and therefore somewhat out of date in this rapidly evolving field, this entire article (pp. 65-94) is nevertheless extremely useful to the professional "outsider" for its concise summaries of basic verbal conditioning studies and the experimental models developed to carry them out. 25 "Verbal Conditioning and Psychotherapy," in RIBM, p. 213. 26Salzinger, "Experimental Manipulation of Verbal Behavior," pp. 65-67; Albert Bandura and Richard H. Walters, Social Learning and Personality Development (New York, 1963), 241-242, 244.</page><page sequence="29">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 295 differential application to the subject's vocal stream of such reinforcing words as "Good," or "Right," or "Yes," or "You're doing fine." Or in the clinical situation, "if the psychologist decides that his goal is to reduce delusional speech, he will respond with attention and pleasure to rational, nondelusional verbal behavior and ignore or respond coldly to bizarre verbalizations."27 In other words, by successive approximations the experimenter shapes and re- structures the habitual verbal topography of the subject by directing all of his attention to accessible and manipulatable verbalization, rather than to the inaccessible and entirely inferential mental world. The connection between such verbal conditioning experimentation and the principles derived from infrahuman learning studies, such as reinforcement, shaping, and extinction, is perhaps best exemplified by Kurt Salzinger's descrip- tion of the verbal conditioning of two young and probably psychotic children, C-1 and C-2. At the outset of the experiment, neither of these children could speak at all; they were capable only of "babbling and animal-like sounds." Following the principles of operant learning, the experimenter began by building upon this unpromising behavioral repertory: he first reinforced any kind of vocalization with candy, precisely as the Skinner-box experimenter may begin shaping a white rat or pigeon by reinforcing any kind of movement. Once the candy reinforcement had established a high rate of indiscriminate vocalization in both C-1 and C-2, the experimenter then moved on to his next sharply delimited sub-specification: he now reinforced "only those vocalizations which were judged to be of eventual utility in actual speech;... spitting noises and animal-like screeches were not reinforced." At this point in the shaping process, as the animal-like sounds moved toward extinction, it became apparent that one of the children was capable of "extended continuous vocalizations punctuated by one or more stresses." While Salzinger does not remark upon it, it is philosophically suggestive that at this juncture the topography of the children's free vocalizations-and especially the manifestation of stress emission capability-began to shape the experiment rather than the other way around: the emission of stresses was now reinforced, as well as any discrete sounds which were not part of an extended vocalization. Presently, under this regimen, one child was shaped to the point where he produced "short discrete sounds predominantly." The next step in the shaping process, then, was the reinforcement of approximations of discrete words. When the child began producing word-approximations predominantly, a col- lection of objects (mostly stuffed animals) was introduced, and from this point forward reinforcement occurred only when the child discriminated among the objects by word-approximations or actual words. At the end of the experi- ment, one of the children had an established vocabulary related to the objects used in the experiment, and indeed was able to bring various toys to the experi- menter upon verbal command.28 Once again it will seem to the teacher of English that such experimentation is very far removed from the classroom difficulties and problems that he faces every day. And in one sense this is true: viewed functionally, the current 27"Verbal Conditioning and Psychotherapy," in RIBM, p. 213; also p. 360. 28Kurt Salzinger, et al., "Operant Conditioning of Verbal Behavior in Two Young Speech Deficient Boys," in RIBM, pp. 82-105; my version here, of course, is a broad- stroke simplification of a highly complex and minutely programmed experiment.</page><page sequence="30">296 COLLEGE ENGLISH verbal conditioning studies, with their stress on vocal rather than scribal activity, are not much help. But viewed conceptually and philosophically, they may open doors that have been too long closed. Once again the incandescent fact is that such experimentation appears to make possible the functional improvement of verbal activity without reference to mental processes at all. If vocal behavior can be restructured by simple environmental manipulation, then the teacher of English must attend to the possibility that scribal behavior is susceptible to similar modification. We need to develop experimental writing situations, both within the classroom and without, to test the applicability of operant learning principles to the act of writing-and it is to the structuring of such an experi- mental classroom model that I now wish to turn. VIII All of the foregoing makes it clear that a truly behavioral classroom pedagogy aimed at the improvement of scribal activity will have to incorporate, insofar as possible, certain fundamental principles of operant learning which are con- siderably at variance with much current classroom practice. The most important of these are: (1) Concentration on the act of writing, rather than on the artifactual written word. (2) Pedagogical exploitation of the verbal repertory, both vocal and scribal, which the student possesses as he enters the classroom. (3) A classroom environment so structured as to permit innumerable scribal responses, rather than just a few. (4) A pedagogical situation which permits more or less immediate reinforcement of those aspects of the individual's scribal activity which represent functional improvement. (5) A classroom technique for developing chained sub-specifications of acceptable scribal activity geared to the capabilities of the individual student, with "bulls- eye" or "I've-caught-you-off-base" teaching reduced to a minimum. To see how such a classroom might actually work, let us imagine for sim- plicity's sake that we face a single student rather than the usual twenty or thirty. Let us further imagine that we are in office conference, and that we are criticizing a paragraph the student has written, a paragraph characterized by muddy topic limitation, by tangled or meandering sentence structure, and by incoherencies within and between sentences. In as attempt to set up the sort of office-conference "happening" I have already described, we say: "Mr. Jones, I cannot make head nor tail of this paragraph: what in the world were you trying to tell me here?" In response to this question, the student, sometimes with alacrity and sometimes after considerable vocal stumbling about, launches into that cortical utterance or visceral blurt, in the course of which he says the thing he was unable to write, producing in the vocal modality a word-pattern which is protoscribal and to a greater or lesser degree rhetorically viable. If at first venture Mr. Jones does not produce such a germinal word-pattern, we simply continue this exercise in what Andrew Wilkinson has called "Reciprocal Speech,"29 until 29"English and the Training of Teachers," and also William T. Spogue, "Teaching Written and Oral English in Nonselective Secondary Schools," both in A Common Purpose (Champaign, Ill., 1966), pp. 180-182 and pp. 90-91.</page><page sequence="31">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 297 Mr. Jones does produce some segment of sound, the word-pattern substrate of which gives us what we need to begin a scribal learning sequence. At this point we have two courses of action open to us. On the one hand, we can simply exclaim over this sudden vocal clarification of Mr. Jones' intentions in the paragraph, asking him why he didn't write that if that's what he meant, and sending him back to the dormitory to "rewrite the whole paragraph along those lines and turn it in tomorrow." Or we can do something which I believe is a good deal less usual in this situation: we can turn immediately to a large blackboard which just happens to be taking up half the space in the office, and demand that Mr. Jones instantly write down on the board that segment of his vocal emission which approximates the thing he was previously unable to say in the scribal modality. And then begins a vocal-to-scribal dialogue between teacher and student aimed at the sharpening and expansion of this vocal kernel or word-pattern substrate. Perhaps we pretend to misunderstand the first four or five words in the vocal transcript we now have on the board: we persuade Mr. Jones to come up with a second, more focused vocal clarification. As soon as he does, we exclaim, "Good! Write that down, Mr. Jones." As soon as this revision is on the board, we turn our attention perhaps to an ambiguity in meaning which has cropped up because in translating his vocal emission into the scribal modality Mr. Jones has lost certain paralingual signals which helped carry his full mean- ing in the vocal mode. We lead him to come up with a vocal statement which eliminates or reduces this ambiguity, and we have him write this instantly on the board, accompanying this demand with more reinforcing comment. By this time, of course, the scribal pattern we have in front of us has developed considerably beyond the vocal-kernel stage. We then ask Mr. Jones to concentrate on certain elements of the scribal pattern to the exclusion of other elements; with luck, he shortly produces vocalizations which give us two rhetorically developed sentences on the board. We then lead Mr. Jones, by judicious queries, to the vocal assertion of the implications, or the assumptions, or the logical consequences of what he has already written, and as rapidly as he comes up with protoscribally viable bits of sound stream we express reinforcing approval and have him get them down on the board before they escape. If, in the course of this vocal-to-scribal dialogue, with the instructor con- stantly feeding in sociovocal reinforcement, Mr. Jones loosens up in the way that I have occasionally seen my own students loosen up during such sessions, he will begin producing rhetorically viable word-patterns at such a rate that it will be necessary to get them down on the board as quickly as possible, for later reconsideration, sharpening, and arrangement in efficacious rhetorical se- quence. In any case, we end up, hopefully, with a paragraph, or at least a sentence-cluster, which says in Mr. Jones' veritable words (rather than the instructor's) what Mr. Jones really had in mind when he wrote that first, utterly opaque paragraph back at the dormitory.30 301 must anticipate the reader who concludes at this point that the talk-write pedagogy is nothing more than an extrapolation of the same kind as those which have given us the teaching machine and the present plethora of programmed texts. Since I believe that neither of these pedagogical devices represents a valid extrapolation from infrahuman learning principles, I would deprecate any effort to lump the talk-write pedagogy with them. Because the issue is somewhat outside the objectives of this study, I will simply</page><page sequence="32">298 COLLEGE ENGLISH Such vocal-to-scribal dialogue will not be as easy to maintain as it may appear at first glance. In verbal conditioning the phrasing of the sociovo~cal reinforcers which the experimenter or therapist applies to his subject are of crucial importance and under careful, predetermined control. He may do nothing but nod his head sympathetically, or nothing but interject an approving "Yes, of course," into the subject's vocal stream at appropriate moments. While such rigid, automatonistic control is neither possible nor desirable in the class- room situation, nevertheless what the English instructor does say, the way he phrases his part in the vocal-to-scribal dialogue, is of crucial importance. My own experience is that it is absolutely fatal to urge the student to "think it out" or "think again" or "reconsider." Such abjurations have an effect precisely the opposite of the one desired in the operant learning situation. Tell a student to think and there will be an immediate drop in the density and variety of external behavior. His body tenses up, he becomes motionless, his face takes on a wooden expression, and his vocalization drops to zero for the simple reason remark that I have yet to see a machine program or a programmed text which achieves a tenable application of the fundamental principle of successive approximations. The hard fact is that most human knowledge is not really susceptible to approximate formulation. What, for example, would constitute an approximate response to the following "frame": "The President of the United States during the Civil War was ---"? Clearly, "Ulysses S. Grant" is not a behaviorally approximate answer, and neither is "Stephen A. Douglas." The only behaviorally approximate response to this "frame" would be a vocal or scribal emission something like "Slabrahan Jinken," and if there is available a machine program or progammed text which permits such behaviorally valid but ideationally nonsensical responses, I am happily unaware of it. The problem is illustrated by a mimeographed document I have on my desk en- titled "Reinforcement Techniques and the Modification of Disruptive Behavior in the Classroom: a Programmed Approach," carrying a 1967 copyright, which devotes dozens of pages or "frames" to inculcating the theory of successive approximations, without once offering an approximate answer, or tolerating such a response from the student. Answers are either "right" or "wrong"; they are never approximate. A generally available example of the same anomaly is the "semiprogrammed" text by Wendell I. Smith and J. William Moore, Conditioning and Instrumental Learning (New York, 1966): pages 100-105 demand non-approximate responses concerning approximation theory. I am forced to the conclusion, therefore, that the teaching machine and the pro- grammed text, no matter how effective in actual classroom practice, are seldom Skinnerian and never rodential. What they actually give us is a terminal, non-approximate behavior presented in a massively segmented and interlocked form. As such, they appear to be merely an elaborate version of the T-maze learning situation, essentially unrelated to operant learning principles. Only behavior which is susceptible to a "good-better-best" characterization- rhetorical behavior on the sentence and paragraph level is an example-appears to me to offer viable application of operant theory in the classroom; the "right-wrong" situation leads to inevitable distortions. I hasten to add that I seem to be holding this particular fort all by myself: for an entirely optimistic assessment which merely skirts the problem of approximation, see B. F. Skinner, "Teaching Machines," Science, CXXVIII (24 October, 1958), 969-977; and also J. G. Holland, "Teaching Machines: An Application of Principles From the Laboratory," Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, III (1960), 275-287. What is especially distressing is the fact that such distortions are beginning to appear with increasing frequency in published material addressed to the problems of English com- position. The indiscriminate application of operant conditioning nomenclature to our traditional pedagogy can only multiply our difficulties rather than diminishing them. Just because a student writes three versions of a thesis sentence in a five-minute period, it does not neces- sarily follow that the versions are "approximations" of anything, nor that they were "suc- cessive" in a rigorously operant sense. Without constant and sharply articulated specification, behaviorally determined and accompanied by successive extinction, they are a serial sequence of three versions, and nothing more.</page><page sequence="33">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 299 that everything in his cultural and school experience has told him that thinking is one thing and talking quite another. This means that the instructor must sustain his half of the verbal-scribal dialogue with as little reference to thinking as possible. Instead, his comments must be phrased to elicit an immediate vocal response: he must assume that the student has already thought the rhetorical problem out, and that it is only necessary to get him to say effectively what he already knows. In short, the whole vocal-to-scribal dialogue should be designed to get the student to talk rather than think. (I am aware that many English teachers will regard this as a shocking inversion of priorities.) The question now is: can such a talk-write pedagogy be successfully trans- ferred from the single-student situation we have described here to the actual classroom where we must deal effectively with from twenty to thirty stu- dents? Offhand, I can see no substantial objections to such a translation and, indeed, I can visualize some advantages which are not available in the one-to- one student-teacher relationship. In order to see how this would work, however, we must imagine a classroom considerably different from the sort which generally characterizes the teaching of English composition today. The central difference is that nearly all desks and chairs, and the teacher's lectern, are all eliminated. The next most important difference is that instead of the usual large blackboard or pair of blackboards at the front of the room we have wrap-around boards extending along the entire perimeter of the room. In the open floor space where the students' desks used to be we have large free-standing and movable flip- blackboards, or perhaps better vet, large pads of blank newsprint mounted on free-standing and movable frames, each equipped with felt pens or similar broad-stroke devices for length-of-the-room visibility. The overall effect as one entered such a classroom would be that it was not a classroom at all, but rather a studio over in the art department. Such an effect is intended: words are in many ways as plastic and artistic a medium as paint or clay, and the talk-write classroom should reflect this fact. Such a classroom would be designed for many types of vocal-to-scribal dialogue, including dialogue between the instructor and the entire class, between the instructor and a single student or between two students with the rest of the class observing, between pairs of students with one writing and one playing the part of scribal auditor, or among three or four students, each working on a common problem at his own newsprint "blackboard." Much of the time, the instructor would simply move about the room commenting, evaluating, and suggesting in much the way that an art instructor moves about his class in beginning drawing. The pedagogy to go with such a classroom would be at first both utterance- based and sentence-oriented, since this emphasis makes possible the greatest number of unitary responses in a given talk-write session, as operant learning demands. Moreover, the blackboard and/or newsprint pad arrangement would give the student an increasingly strong sense of the plasticity and fluidity of language. In place of the sort of verbal commitment which comes with "taking pen in hand," especially when this action is buttressed by preparatory note- taking and elaborate outlining, the student would have the kinesthetic satis- faction of obliterating his blackboard mistakes with the swipe of an eraser, or listening to the resounding rip of newsprint as he tears the top sheet off the pad to give himself a fresh start. He would, with practice, have something</page><page sequence="34">300 COLLEGE ENGLISH of the sense of free possibilities of the artist who goes through sheet after sheet on a sketch pad, making and rejecting trial sketches. The whole pro- cess, in short, is designed to loosen up the student's verbal behavior. Finally, because each of his scribal efforts must be preceded by vocalization, the student would have the opportunity to learn in a systematic way that many of the lingual and paralingual signals which help carry the meaning of vocali- zation are not available in the scribal medium; he should achieve in the talk-write classroom an increasingly sharp awareness of the fact that vocal utterance can usually be no more than protoscribal, and that he is dealing with two sharply different modalities, each of which has its own internal laws and imperatives. He would, in other words, constantly be making the kind of modal comparisons which are not really possible when talk is separated from writing, as it consistently is under the think-write rubric. IX The general differences between such a pedagogy and the current think-write approach are too obvious to require much comment. Beyond the twelve or so response aggregates or themes over a semester, the talk-write student has hundreds and perhaps thousands of opportunities to make a scribal response. Moreover, no matter whether he is working on the initial utterance-sentence level, or at a more advanced level where he is integrating utterance-elements into larger units such as the paragraph, he will be dealing constantly with utterance-level scribal units which return him quickly to a resting stance, as prescribed by learning theory, ready to make another response. Most crucially, the student's responses in the scribal modality will receive immediate reinforcement, whether by the instructor or by some other member of the class who is working with him as part of a vocal-to-scribal dialogue team. He will not have to wait a week or more until the instructor finally returns a marked and graded theme which tells him little more than that he missed the bullseye. Finally, each class session begins with the vocal and scribal repertory which the student possesses at that moment, and each vocal-to-scribal effort should, in a properly directed talk-write classroom, represent an increasingly close and generally successive approximation of effective rhetorical activity. The archetype we call "Good Writing" is thus approached on a graduated scale of sub-specifica- tions, rather than by the great leap which is implicit in the think-write pedagogy based exclusively on the five-hundred word theme. Over and above these differences between a think-write and a talk-write pedagogy, and beyond these correlations between talk-write techniques and the general principles of operant learning, there are four more specific principles (more precisely, they will become "principles" when experimentally verified) which are peculiar to the talk-write pedagogy itself: (1) The Principle of Intermodal Transfer. The whole talk-write system is based on two assumptions concerning the relationship of the vocal to the scribal mode. First, it is assumed that virtually all students will be significantly and often overwhelmingly better at talking than at writing, simply because the life-situation dictates that they have infinitely more practice, and consequently more skill, in the vocal rather than the scribal modality. Second, the talk-write pedagogy assumes that this preponderant skill in the vocal modality can be exploited by</page><page sequence="35">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 301 means of the talk-write dialogue to achieve through intermodal transfer an in- crease in skill in the scribal modality. In this sense, the student is teaching himself by transferring learned skill from one behavioral area to another. (2) The Principle of Intermodal Integration. A striking characteristic of many students' verbal behavior is that they "sound" one way when talking, and quite another way when writing. If they have a consistent "voice" at all, it is in the speech area. In contrast, their writing is simply congeries of words, entirely lacking in any distinguishing "voice." One of the objectives of the talk-write peda- gogy is to overcome this modal disjunction: on the one hand, the rapid alternation between vocal and scribal activity should lead to a reshaping and vitalizing of the scribal mode, so that the student's written "voice" begins to take on some of the characteristics of his speaking "voice." On the other hand, the cross-modal influences should also operate in the other direction, so that the topography of his vocal emissions begins to take on some of the "literate" characteristics which distinguish the trained speaker from the mere talker. Writing, in short, should improve talk, and talk, writing. (3) The Principle of Sociovocal Reinforcement. One of the most important characteristics of the talk-write classroom is that it makes writing and the analysis and criticism of writing a social event. In contrast to the traditional writing situation, where each student privately, at his own isolated desk or in his own room, writes his own private theme which is then privately corrected by his instructor, in the talk-write classroom whatever the student writes is there for all to see: he has at his side either the instructor or another student engaging in vocal-to-scribal dialogue with him, and if his difficulty is of special significance he may become part of a vocal-to-scribal dialogue with the whole class participat- ing. One of the great anomalies of current pedagogical practice in the teaching of English is that while we freely recognize the almost totally social nature of vocal activity, we appear to be most reluctant to attend to a similar social dimension in writing. One suspects that we English teachers have been too much influenced by the "loner" tradition in literary creation and literary scholar- ship, perhaps best exemplified by Milton speaking of "my lamp at midnight hour ... in some high lonely Tower." Dylan Thomas, too, may have found his craft a sullen art, but for the apprentice writer we must consider the possibility that it ought perhaps to be social rather than sullen. Lonely writing, or at least lonely learning about writing, may be an academic perversion.31 (4) The Principle of Autogenetic Specification. I have already discussed how the experimenter working with infrahuman behavior must always be able to specify with great precision the next successive approximation of the terminal behavior which he wishes the organism to learn. And I have pointed out what appears to me to be the greatest weakness of current compositional pedagogy, the almost total lack of intermediate or sub-specifications to bridge the often enormous gap between the student's actual scribal capacities and the invisible archetype at which we wish him to aim. Too often, we insist that the student hit 31The idea of the writer as "Isolato" (Melville's term) flourishes with undiminished vigor in even the recent analyses of compositional pedagogy. John Dixon, for example, while properly insisting that successful writing situations can only spring out of ear- lier discussion and social interaction, nevertheless asserts that "To write...is to move from social and shared work to an opportunity for private and individual work." A pupil's stories and poems are for Dixon "necessarily private activities." Growth Through English, pp. 44, 55.</page><page sequence="36">302 COLLEGE ENGLISH an invisible bullseye, and when he fails to do so we give him an "F" he does not really deserve. This lack of genuine specification is overcome by a central, crucially im- portant characteristic of the talk-write pedagogy. As the student moves back and forth from the vocal to the scribal mode, he is constantly drawing on his relatively greater proficiency in the vocal mode to develop the next requisite sub- specification in the scribal mode. His talk, to say the same thing less pretentiously, is the specification for his writing. Of great importance here is the fact that this vocal specification is never imposed from without, except to the extent that the instructor or a fellow student makes a suggestion that the student then revocalizes, but rather springs out of the student's own unique way of saying things. Thanks to autogenetic specification, the student need never worry about how distantly or closely he is approaching some invisible terminal specification. He approaches the desired level gradually by constantly listening to himself. In an almost literal sense, autogenetic specification makes the student-as-talker the teacher and mentor of the student-as-writer in a kind of transmodal "operation bootstrap." X I will not be disturbed if some of my colleagues feel that the classroom techniques just described are really disappointingly simple in view of all the elaborate theory that preceded them. I will, in fact, be encouraged, since I enter- tain the conviction that an elaborate pedagogy is not justified by elaborate the- oretical underpinnings. The only good pedagogy, it seems to me, is one so simple that it can be applied with great effectiveness by the teacher who knows little or nothing about the theoretical structure from which it springs. The point is important because we are not yet done with theory. We have yet to direct our attention to the way in which talk-write correlates with certain operative principles developed by various experimenters and psychotherapists working in the laboratory and clinical situations. That done, we will have to glance quickly at some of the philosophical and linguistic implications of the talk-write approach to the teaching of English composition. The psychotherapeutic correlations that I wish to make have their roots in the work of two experimenters, both of whom stand well within the Pavlovian (as contrasted to Freudian) tradition: W. Horslev Gantt and Alexander R. Luria (or Luriia). Taken together, the work of these two investigators may possibly give the teacher of English a conceptual framework to account for the puzzling, not to say baffling, modal disjunctiveness which characterizes the verbal behavior of perhaps a majority of the students we encounter on the college level: they talk reasonably well, but write very badly. We usually account for this phenomenon (as I did myself a few pages back) by asserting that the student has had "more practice" in speaking than in writing-but this is perhaps another of those ex- planations which one encounters so frequently in language studies, which label a phenomenon without really accounting for it. The work of W. Horsley Gantt makes it possible to suggest that what we are actually observing here may be a kind of split or disjunction in the con- ditioning or reflexive habit-formation of two distinct areas of the total sensory- verbal mechanism. To make such an assertion, however, requires that I make an extrapolation from Gantt's precise investigative area, and I must stress that the</page><page sequence="37">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 303 extrapolation is mine, not his. Gantt is concerned, not with verbal behavior, but with the purely Pavlovian conditioning of various systemic areas of the total bodily activity: that is, his experimental work is focused on the conditioned reflex as it manifests itself in the (a) visceral, (b) cardiac, and (c) motoric areas. Gantt's comparative study of these various systems has led him to the con- clusion that one system, such as the visceral, may be conditioned in one way, and another, such as the motoric, may be conditioned in another way which is not compatible with the first, or with the external environment. The result, Gantt asserts, is "a split between the functions of the organism so that the organism may be in adaption with some of its organs and some of its reactions, but not with others." This intersystemic functional split within the individual organism Gantt calls schizokinesis, which he sees as one of the roots of neurotic behavior. For example, Gantt cites the case of the experimental animal which may be "under very violent agitation from the visceral and emotional organs, even though he appears [in terms of skeletomuscular or motoric activity] to be in adaption with what we see on the surface."32 A little reflection will suggest that there is nothing strange about the idea of schizokinesis: we are all familiar with the individual whose externalized, motoric activity suggests total calm and utter placidity-until we notice that he is on a diet of skim milk and baby food for the ulcer we cannot see. And indeed, the concept of schizokinesis is strikingly in consonance with Eliot's use, in his famous essay on the English Metaphysical Poets, of the term "dissociation of sensibility," by which he meant the dissociation of thought from feeling. The Metaphysicals, Eliot asserted, because they did not suffer from' this dissociation, were capable of "a direct sensuous apprehension of thought, or a recreation of thought into feeling ...." The parallels between these ideas and Gantt's schizokinesis are interesting because they suggest that the poet, the supreme writer, may be what he is thanks to the superior integration and compatible conditioning of his autonomic (or visceral) system on the one hand with his verbal-motoric system on the other-which gives us, I venture to say, the first (and no doubt the last) physio- logical definition of the poet. But the teacher of English is not, in the usual composition classroom, concerned with poets who write superbly, but rather with students who often cannot write at all, although they often talk reasonably well. A rigorous application of Gantt's schizokinesis cannot be made to their disjunctive verbal behavior since schizo- kinesis applies to intersystemic disjunctions, as between the autonomic and skeleto- muscular systems, while the students' difficulties are verbally intrasystemic, between speaking and writing. And this is where my extrapolation comes in. It seems reasonable to assume that intersvstemic schizokinesis should be paralleled by a modal schizokinesis operating within a single system. Research ought to be 32"Autonomic Conditioning," in CT, p. 122; Gantt, "Principles of Nervous Breakdown- Schizokinesis and Autokinesis," in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, LVI (1953), 143-163, and especially 156-158; also Gantt, J. E. O. Newton, and F. I. Royer, "Development of the Experimental Neurosis: Mechanism and Factors," in Proceedings of the Third World Congress on Psychiatry (Montreal, 1960), pp. 991-995. It is Gantt's experimental stress on autonomic activity and its relation to the skeletomuscular system which caused me, earlier in this paper, to describe certain student vocalizations, not only as "cortical utterances," but also as "visceral blurts." I was after more than a cute term: when in a reciprocal speech situation with a teacher, what a student suddenly blurts out may have an emotive verity and scribal viability which are not present in his more judicious and inhibitively controlled ut- terances.</page><page sequence="38">304 COLLEGE ENGLISH able to tell the teacher of English whether or not this is the case. If it is, then the talk-write pedagogy may be of help in achieving a monokinetic "weld" between vocal and scribal activity. Just as suggestive is the research of the Soviet worker, Alexander R. Luria. If Gantt's investigations point up the need for a tight conditionist "weld" between discrete systems within the organism, Luria's work emphasizes the need for a similar functional and responsive linkage between two parts of a single system, the verbo-motoric. The conclusions which Luria reaches are of importance to the teacher of composition because there is (obviously) such a large motoric element not only in speech, but also in writing, an element to which we have paid little attention, no doubt because of the pervasive influence of the think- write metaphor. Specifically, in an extended series of experiments which involved having a child squeeze a rubber bulb in response to certain stimulus patterns, Luria and his Soviet colleagues found that motor activity could be both modified and sharpened when the child supplied his own speech cues. That is, when the child was asked to squeeze the bulb without coordinate speech cues, motoric activity as measured by the bulb was diffuse and badly coordinated. But when the child was permitted to supply his own verbal cue to the bulb-squeezing activity ("Go!"), motor activity immediately sharpened. Says Luria, "...the introduction by the child of speech into the experiment fully eliminates the diffuseness of the motor processes, strictly coordinates the movements with the [stimulus] signals and imparts to them a distinct and organized character; we can also see that with the abolition of this verbal reinforcement the motor reactions of the child again acquire a diffuse character and become poorly controlled." Such experiments highlight what Luria calls "the regulatory influence of the child's own speech" upon motor behavior.33 Such experimentation would appear to supply at least an indirect justification for the talk-write pedagogy we have outlined here. Both Gantt's and Luria's work seems to emphasize the absolute necessity of not divorcing talk from writing. Rather, every effort should be made to develop and constantly strengthen a functional connection between the scribal-motoric and the vocal-motoric areas of the total verbal system. Admittedly, the leap from the work of both Gantt and Luria to the composition classroom is a very large one, which perhaps we would not even attempt were it not for the fact that certain psychotherapists have taken the experimental conclusions of Gantt and Luria, or ones very similar to them, out of the laboratory and into the clinical situation. A large part of the justification for the talk-write pedagogy, for example, can be found in Andrew Salter's assertion that the development of the healthy, functional personality involves the kind of conditioning which results in "the welding of speech to action."34 Used as a therapeutic device, Salter calls this weld- ing process "feeling talk," which he defines as the "deliberate utterance of spon- 33The Role of Speech in the Regulation of Normal and Abnormal Behavior (New York, 1961), pp. 76, 84. 34Andrew Salter, "The Theory and Practice of Conditioned Reflex Therapy," in CT, pp. 26-28, 32; see also Salter, Conditioned Reflex Therapy (New York, 1949, 1961). The constant stress on the necessity of joining talking and writing in the classroom was perhaps the most valuable recommendation of the Anglo-American Dartmouth Con- ference. See Herbert J. Muller, The Uses of English (New York, 1967), especially Ch. Six, "Writing and Talking," pp. 97-112.</page><page sequence="39">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 305 taneously felt emotions. If the patient likes soup," Salter continues, "he is to say, out loud, 'I like the soup.' He is to put his emotional responses into his verbo- motor system" (italics mine). Drawing on Gantt, Salter continues The concept of schizokinesis gives the answer to those patients of mine (the vast majority) who ask me, 'Why do I have to say it out loud? Can't I just think it?' I answer this by saying, 'All of your life, by inhibiting your emotional impulses, you have created your present problems. You will continue this neurotic pattern until you do say it out loud and thus disinhibit your responses. Feeling it is only half of it. Saying it, getting it into your muscles is the other half" (italics mine). And Salter quotes Dykman, Gantt, and Whitehorn:35 ...We believe that normal healthy learning is characterized by an integration of autonomic and motor responses at both the emotional and problem solving levels. It is suggested that any lack of integration (schizokinesis) occurring at any point in the learning process is indicative of psychopathology. Where such schizokinesis occurs, continues Salter, the aim must be the "rewelding of the autonomic and motor systems. In union is strength and mental health." It does not seem unreasonable to assume that the achievement of a functional "weld" between autonomic and motor systems should perhaps be paralleled by a similar functional weld-or the lack of it-between the vocal-motoric and scribal-motoric systems. Again, research ought to tell the teacher of English whether such an hypothesis will stand up under controlled scrutiny or not. In any case, Salter's application of "feeling talk," the constant in-put or cross-feed from one motoric area to another, provides substantial conceptual justification for the vocal-to-scribal dialogue which is a central element of the talk-write pedagogy. Moreover, Salter's application of the ideas of both Gantt and Luria may give us a useful insight into the genesis of the writing problems which the teacher of English so frequently encounters on both the high school and the college levels. We need to know, in other words, not only the nature of the writing prob- lem a student may have, but also how he got that way in the first place. Drawing again on Luria's theories, Salter points out that in many verbal environ- ments the child quickly perceives that what the parent or other authority-figure says, and what he does are two different things. "Is it any wonder that a verbal- motor schism develops? Words from the external environment become con- ditioned to mean things-you-do-not-do. The environment is the chronic enemy." In such a situation, Salter concludes, " Words-from-others are never words-for-me. The central figure in this dissociative process, if it occurs at all, is, for both Luria and Salter, the child's mother, who functions as primary "verbal condi- tioner." But this may be too gross a view of the situation. While it is obvious that the child's mother acts as primary reinforcer in the functional sense, she generally is not so in the conceptual sense which, in the long view of language activity, may be the more important. Rather than the mother, it is the child's teachers-and in America especially the teacher of English-who give the child, directly or in- directly, consciously or unconsciously, whatever conceptual stance toward lan- 35R.

Whitehorn, "Conditioning as Emotional Sensiti- zation and Differentiation," in Psychological Monographs, LXX (1956), 17.</page><page sequence="40">306 COLLEGE ENGLISH guage and its uses he may assume. This is particularly true of verbal-scribal activity. Few mothers teach their children to write, and still less to write well; this task is generally left to the teacher, from kindergarten through college. For scribal activity at least, it is the teacher, rather than the mother, who is the primary verbal conditioner in both the functional and the conceptual senses. In view of all this, if the college-level teacher of English finds that a signifi- cant number-and often a majority-of the students he encounters suffer (to paraphrase Salter) from a kind of "vocal-scribal schism," how is he to account for this phenomenon? A full answer to this question would involve us in cultural and sociological questions far beyond the scope of this study. Conse- quently, I will simply label as provocative the views, for example, of Edgar Z. Frie- denberg that within the "...sugary gentility of the [American highschooll classroom..." the arts and literature are "pasteurized" in order "to protect society from 'subjectivity' [and] from people with an excessively personal style ." since, as Friedenberg sees it, one of the principal functions of the school in a mass society is to "forestall the development of real taste, to root out and wither both real elegance and real vulgarity and replace them with the banal, the generalized other" (italics mine)." I cannot myself generalize upon the American schools, but I can generalize upon the hundreds of themes I have read over the years: most of them are sufficiently "banal" to offer striking support for Mr. Friedenberg's thesis. What is even more striking is the fact that many if not most of the students who write such themes do not talk the way they write, although most of them are, like most of us, capable of being banal in any modality. One might conclude that the "pasteurization" Mr. Friedenberg speaks of goes on in the schools-and in many college classrooms-with especial vigor in regard to the written word: in our culture, that which is tolerated in the vocal mode becomes shocking when translated into the scribal mode, as witness Holden Caulfield's reception by many high school teachers and librarians. My own experience suggests that if the average student can write only in banalities and generalities it is because, somewhere along the line, the act of writing has become entirely dissociated from both reality itself, and from what- ever verbal-vocal "voice" the student may have developed in coping with that reality. The result can be described in part by Andrew Salter's "verbal-motor schism"; the rest can be described as a conditioned "scribal-ontological schism." Students have learned that in the writing situation they do not have to say any- thing real; this would account for the young lady who told me that "everyone in Denver has a nice place to live," even though she knew better; for that cer- tification candidate who came up with theme topics about "inner beauty" for juvenile delinquents; and for the hundreds of students we have all seen who can write five hundred words on "My Goals in Life" without ever mentioning a specific "goal." Such students, trained to write pasteurized and depersonalized prose, are very resentful of the college English instructor who likes his ideas all grubby and covered with veritable bacteria. If the ideas of Salter and Luria have any validity when translated from the vocal to the scribal modality, and if the teacher of English is indeed the primary scribal conditioner, then one is forced to the conclusion that the verbally schizoid 36Coming of Age in America: Growth and Acquiescence (New York, 1963, 1967), pp. 193, 177, 175.</page><page sequence="41">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 307 student has encountered, in one class or in many classes, English teachers so de- voted to "correctness," "propriety," and "neatness," all perhaps buttressed by a diffuse dedication to the "higher things," that they have methodically if uncon- sciously destroyed Salter's "weld" between word and action, between writing and the real world the student actually knows, so that he finally develops a genuinely tragic proficiency in writing themes made up of words-for-teacher which are seldom if ever words-for-me.'T Andrew Salter's "feeling talk," translated into the talk-write composition classroom, could help initiate the requisite vocal-scribal re-weld; equally suggestive in this connection is the behaviorally oriented "assertive response" therapy developed by Joseph Wolpe:38 37Such schizoid consequences of current educational practice have received little atten- tion, most probably because most professionals who interest themselves in the edu- cational process are oriented instrumentally rather than ontologically. In the thirty- five small-print pages of Michael Shugrue's 1966 summary of the USOE programs, for example, only the report of the Curriculum Study Center at Florida State University hinted that there might be a behavioral or conditioned dimension to language activity, and that only in a single paragraph: "In general, probably, students in the seventh grade are capable of handling more mature literature than the staff of the Center had anticipated. An important distinction, however, must be made between surface, 'public' responses to literary selections and personal or 'private' responses. That is, a number of students are able to make correct, approved responses to selections without experiencing any kind of personally reward- ing experience with the selection." ("New Materials for the Teaching of English: The English Program of the USOE," PMLA, LXXXI [September, 1966], pp. 3-38; p. 13.) The 1967 report (PMLA, LXXXII [November], 15-32), is of course characterized by a similar inattention to the way students behave. 38I discuss here only a fragment of Wolpe's entire therapeutic schema, which involves reciprocal inhibition through deep muscle relaxation in the presence of hierarchically arranged schedules of anxiety-generating stimuli. Most of this appears to lack a peda- gogical dimension, with the possible exception of the anxiety-hierarchy device: to the extent that the sentence, the sentence-cluster, the paragraph, the group of paragraphs, and the whole composition can legitimately be regarded as an anxiety-hierarchy, Wolpe's theories would appear to give sanction to the utterance- and sentence-centered emphasis of the talk-write pedagogy. See Joseph Wolpe, "The Comparative Clinical Status of Condition- ing Therapies and Psychoanalysis," in CT, p. 11; Wolpe and Arnold A. Lazarus, Behavior Therapy Techniques: A Guide to the Treatment of Neurosis (Oxford, New York, 1966), pp. 38-44; Paul Roberts, Understanding English (New York, 1958), p. 414; Friedenberg, Coming of Age in America, p. 122. Wolpe and others in the field have broadened the concept of phobia to include much more generalized behavioral patterns than those described by the "classical" pho- bias. For Wolpe a phobia may include "neurotic fears of incurring obligations, of being watched, or of receiving praise" (CT, p. 11n). Such a broadening leads one to wonder whether the writing situation is not for many people a unifocally phobic situa- tion. We need to pay more attention to the student who is able to address himself effectively or at least continuously to a multiple-choice test or mathematics examina- tion, but who simply "blows up" when asked to write an essay test. Nor are students the only ones for whom the writing situation may be at least mildly phobic. I talked recently to a university Dean who confessed that he got "all bound up" when- ever he had to write anything addressed to the general faculty, because he knew "those bastards over in the English Department" would be looking at what he wrote. In any case, if we combine the possibly phobic dimension of the writing situation with an extrapolation of W. H. Gantt's theories of an autonomic-skeletomuscular split, we come up with a term to describe much writing disability which ought to be Greek enough and scientific enough for anybody: schizokinetic scribophobia.</page><page sequence="42">308 COLLEGE ENGLISH Assertive responses are used where there is a need to overcome.., .such anxieties as prevent a person from expressing his opinions to his friends lest they disagree, or from reprimanding inefficient underlings. The essence of the therapist's role is to encourage appropriate assertiveness, wherever it is reasonable and right to do so, of feelings and action tendencies that anxiety has in the past inhibited. Wolpe uses Salter's term to describe people who are unable to make such re- sponses: they are "inhibitory personalities," without exception characterized by a "lack of integrity of expression of basic feelings and emotions" (italics mine). Many teachers will feel, of course, that proper assertion of self is hardly the problem of a generation of students who have made a fine art of the sit-in, the love-in, and flower-power; yet one could argue that they have developed such modes of expression because at least some of them have difficulty being assertive in more traditional ways. In any case, the absolutely fundamental characteristic of most student themes the average English teacher sees is a "lack of integrity of basic feelings and emotions," though, oddly enough, our elaborate Correction Charts do not generally provide a way of marking such a per- vasive deficiency. One suspects that many students write pasteurized and papier- mdch6 prose on the college level because their formative experiences with the writing situation have been characterized by a legalistic precisionism, a sup- pressive propriety, and a debilitating generality. Paul Roberts has described the average student's tendency to hedge all his statements with "in-my-opinion's," "it-seems-to-me's," and "at-least-from-my-point-of-view's"; Edgar Friedenberg has remarked how for many students "the reading of poetry is a solemn, even ceremonial act ... [tending] to evoke their most cherished cliches," and there is ample evidence that this wooden and anti-individualistic ritualism extends into the scribal area; and all teachers of English still encounter sizeable numbers of students who have been taught that it is "improper" and even "egotistic" to use the first-person pronoun in their writing. In the clinical situation where such non-assertion of self is a problem, Wolpe encourages "acting out": "Each act of assertion to some extent reciprocally inhibits the anxiety, and in consequence somewhat weakens the anxiety response habit." Such acting out, translated to the vocal modality, and thence to the scribal modality, would appear to have considerable application to the talk-write ped- agogy. In the rapid exchange of the vocal-to-scribal dialogue, the teacher could encourage that rhetorical assertiveness which is the root of vitality of statement and integrity of expression. The vocal assertion thus introduces an action-dimen- sion which is entirely missing in pedagogies developed from think-write instru- mental metaphors. XI In everything said so far, I have assumed for clarity's sake that multi-trial operant learning was the only major kind relevant to the writing situation. Many would agree: a Skinnerian rigorist such as C. B. Ferster asserts that "The major process responsible for the development of the progressively more com- plex forms of behavior that emerge during the growth and development of an individual is the shaping of behavior by reinforcement of successive approxi- mations of a final complex repertoire."39 39"Classification of Behavioral Pathology," in RIBM, p. 13.</page><page sequence="43">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 309 But theorists of the socio-behavioral school such as Albert Bandura and Frederick H. Kanfer insist that in addition to multi-trial operant learning there is another kind: no-trial learning, based on the modeling of behavior.40 Bandura makes the compelling point that in many situations multi-trial learning tech- niques "are often exceedingly laborious and inefficient for developing new be- havioral repertoires": ... One does not employ trial-and-error or operant conditioning methods in training children to swim, adolescents to drive an automobile, or in getting adults to acquire vocational skills. Indeed, if training proceeded in this manner, very few persons would ever survive the process of socialization. It is evident from informal observation that the behavior of models is utilized extensively to accelerate the acquisition process, and to prevent one-trial extinction of the organism in situations where an error may produce fatal consequences. Bandura accounts for this kind of learning by the contiguity theory of ob- servation learning: ... When an observer witnesses a model exhibit a sequence of responses the observer acquires, through contiguous association of sensory events, symbolic or representa- tional responses possessing cue properties that are capable of eliciting, at some time after the demonstration, overt responses corresponding to those that had been modeled. Children whose problem is anti-social or hyperaggressive behavior, for example, are led to watch the experimenter model both aggressive and socially acceptable behavior by means of a set of dolls. In other experiments, human models are used. The doll or human which exhibits proper social behavior is lavishly rein- forced with commendation and praise by the experimenter; the "aggressive" doll-or human-is not. It has been established that children who observe such a modeling sequence can at a later date reproduce the body-stance and ges- tures of the models with great accuracy and in chained sequences. They also begin to exhibit a strong preference for the behavior of the model whose be- havior was socially acceptable and therefore reinforced. Again, children with a phobic fear of small animals have had this fear eliminated, not by the relatively laborious method of successive approximations, but simply by repeated observa- tions of a child-model petting and feeding the feared animal. In the area of verbal activity, the editors of Research in Behavior Modification note "how formal aspects of the therapist's speech can become patient models. There have been numerous clinical observations of patients displaying gestural and other motoric behaviors similar to their therapist's." Such observations have 40Albert Bandura, "Behavioral Modification Through Modeling Procedures," in RIBM, pp. 312-313, 328; Bandura, "Behavioral Psychotherapy," Scientific American, CCXVI (March, 1967), pp. 80-81; Leonard Krasner and Leonard P. Ullmann, eds., RIBM, p. 244; Frederick H. Kanfer, "Vicarious Reinforcement: A Glimpse Into the Black Box," in RIBM, pp. 256, 261, 267. For a discussion of the differences between multi-trial oper- ant conditioning and the no-trial learning of the socio-behavioral school, see Albert Bandura and Richard H. Walters, Social Learning and Personality Development (New York, 1963), especially Chs. I, II, and V. It should be noted that Skinner mentions, but does not develop extensively, that aspect of verbal activity which he calls "echoic behavior," which "makes possible a shortcircuiting of the process of progressive approxi- mation," thus speeding up the learning process immensely (VB, pp. 55-64). In this sense, of course, the talk-write pedagogy might be termed autoechoic.</page><page sequence="44">310 COLLEGE ENGLISH been borne out by experimentation such as Frederick H. Kanfer's, in which he applied verbal conditioning techniques to a group of patients, establishing that "the administration of reinforcement to a member of a group might be as effective in changing the behavior of an observing subject as direct reinforce- ment"; Kanfer calls this vicarious reinforcement, which he defines as that which increases the probability that we will do "what we see others doing success- fully." One of the most striking characteristics of such modeling and vicarious reinforcement techniques is this application to groups of people. In contrast to standard psychoanalytic or operant-shaping procedures, Bandura points out that "by altering the reinforcement contingencies of a social group it may be possible to affect the behavior of each member in beneficial ways whereas working with individuals would yield trifling results." I do not think the teacher of English should be put off by the obvious disparities between Skinnerian multi-trial and Bandurian no-trial theories; while the scientists work out their disagreements, we can practice a pragmatic eclecti- cism, drawing from all schools those elements which may have application in the composition classroom. Certainly, the socio-behavioral approach that we have outlined here is relevant to the writing situation at a number of points. It is important to see, for example, that a classroom structured on such social learning techniques overcomes the objection that the talk-write pedagogy can only be effective in the tutorial situation. The whole conceptual and mechani- cal design of the talk-write classroom is shaped toward making the act of writing both public and social. In the talk-write classroom, each student working at his blackboard or newsprint pad is a model of the act of writing for every other member of the class: the talk-write classroom is nothing if not socio- scribal. When one student brings to fruition a successful writing sequence, the other students may observe the process and also observe the reinforcement by the instructor which accompanies such success. If Bandura and Kanfer are right, such vicarious reinforcement will strengthen the observing students' own drive toward effective writing. It is even more important to see the enormous implications of modeling and vicarious reinforcement techniques for both present and future compositional pedagogies. Permit me to make my point in personal terms. During my own K-12 years, during my undergraduate years, and during the fifteen years that I myself have taught English composition, I have seen English instructors de- liver lectures on rhetorical principles such as unity, coherence, and emphasis; I have seen them comment on the textbooks which develop such principles; I have seen them analyze textbook readings and student themes in terms of such principles; I have seen them hand out mimeographed materials of their own composing which illustrated such principles; and I have seen them bring every- thing to class from student newspaper editorials to "Peanuts" cartoons to incul- cate such principles-but I have never, repeat never, seen a composition instruc- tor, whether full professor or graduate student, walk into a composition class- room cold-turkey, with no preparation, ask the class for a specific theme- topic perhaps derived from a previous day's discussion, and then-off the top of his head-actually compose a paragraph which illustrates the rhetorical prin- ciples that are the current concern of the class. The skiing instructor actually skis for his students; the pianist actually plays for his; the teacher of dance can occasionally be caught dancing. We English teachers, generally speaking,</page><page sequence="45">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 311 are different: as far as the students in our composition classes can see, we are very good at talking about writing-but we never write.41 In short, we never model the scribal act. And the reason we don't, of course, is that even though we are teaching a skill (or "art," if that is more palatable) we seem to be hooked on the idea of always coming to class "prepared." And this means that before we assert too roundly that today's students "can't write" and "don't know how to re-write," we had better examine the possibility that the reason they can't is that they have never seen it done-they have just seen it talked about, by "prepared" teachers. Obviously, the socio-behavioral dimension of the talk-write classroom would overcome this central difficulty of our present pedagogy. Because writing in such a classroom is a public act, the weak, non-fluent student can observe the fluent-student-as-model. Moreover, the entire class ought to have many oppor- tunities to observe the talk-write instructor modeling the scribal act, which is a very complex behavior, involving such motoric elements as phrasing, re- phrasing, hesitating, vocalizing, erasing, striking out, recasting, and even actually failing on first venture into the writing situation so that an entirely fresh start has to be made. The difficulty with the present think-write pedagogy, which does not usually include such teacher-modeling, is highlighted by Bandura's useful distinction between cognitive and motoric response. In working with children in what he calls "model-punished" versus "model-reinforced" situations, he noted that the children were able to actually mimic and duplicate the gestural and vocal activity of the "model-reinforced" situation. On the other hand, while they were able to recall clearly and describe verbally the actions observed in the "model-punished" situation, they made no attempt to mimic or duplicate the gestural sequence of the punished model. From these data Bandura derives the conclusion that the children "had learned the cognitive equivalents of the [punished] model's responses, but [these responses] were not translated into their motoric form" (italics mine).-' The distinction is very suggestive. The whole think-write pedagogy seems to be based on the assumption that we have done our job if we give our composition students a merely cognitive grasp of the principles of good writing. Bandura's analysis suggests that this is only half the job. We must devise ways to teach, or at least model, the motoric element of the scribal act.43 41 Here at Colorado State University the English staff has just completed a series of twenty video-tapes of from fifteen to fifty minutes' length, which deal with such things as the thesis sentence, the paragraph, the outline, the research paper, logical fallacies, and diction. Many of these tapes are, in my opinion, of professional TV quality, char- acterized by imagination, vividness, and gem-like condensation. But the most striking fact, which illuminates the artifactual bias of current compositional pedagogies, is that on only one of the twenty tapes does the instructor write, much less write cold-turkey in front of the camera, himself. The other nineteen tapes are all about writing, a very different thing. 42"Behavioral Modification Through Modeling Procedures," in RIBM, pp. 328-329. 43I hasten to add that the concept of pedagogical modeling must be applied with cau- tion. One must not assume that any student will benefit from any act of modeling. Bandura points out that "Social responses are generally composed of a large number of different behavioral units combined in a particular manner....A client who possesses a very narrow repertoire of behavior . . . will, in all probability, display only fragmen- tary imitation of a competent model; on the other hand, a person who has acquired</page><page sequence="46">312 COLLEGE ENGLISH XII There are many philosophical problems in connection with the talk-write pedagogy that I have outlined here, all of which will have to be thought through carefully if this "exercise in interpretation" is ever to come to fruition in the classroom. Four such problems are worthy of comment here; they are the problems of modality, historicity, interiority, and freedom. (1) The Problem of Modality. The great weakness of the Skinner-box analysis of infrahuman behavior on which this study is based lies in the fact that the Skinnerian methodology does not, in fact, measure response or describe be- havior at all; it simply measures rate of response, which is nothing more than a quantifiable abstraction from behavior. Similarly, the Skinnerian learning curve in no way describes behavior; it simply gives us a pictorial representation of how often, in a given time-span, a behavior occurred. This behavior may be called "depressing a lever," but that, too, is an abstraction from the real situa- tion. As Kurt Salzinger points out, "the rat may depress the bar slowly or quickly with the left front paw or the right rear, by leaping on the bar and so on as long as the bar is depressed sufficiently to activate the food magazine." In other words, behavioral modality is entirely ignored: counting the de- pressions of the bar is a neat way to avoid the whole problem of describing what Salzinger calls "the topography of responses."44 Now, modality of response may not be particularly significant in animal learning; so long as the rat depresses the lever or the pigeon pecks the disk, it may make no difference how they get the job done. But when one moves from infrahuman to human behavior, modality becomes-or ought to become- a crucial consideration, if for no other reason than the fact that ethical, moral, and aesthetic considerations in human affairs are frequently defined, not simply in terms of the effect upon the external environment, but rather in terms of the mode by which the effect was achieved. This failure to deal with the modal problem and its implications is, it seems to me, the central failure of the learning theorist's attack upon the complexities of specifically verbal behavior. Skinner's work illustrates the difficulty with particular vividness: even in his early investigations he acknowledges the exist- ence in the responding organism of "gross topographical differences" such as those which occur "when stimuli fall within different sense departments, such as vision and audition." But his handling of the theory of successive approxi- mations means that for him there are no packages of behavior, or units of be- havior, or-of crucial significance-no modalities of behavior. Even though " . . . we find it convenient to distinguish between various operants which differ from each other in topography," he asserts, " . the ultimately con- tinuous nature of behavior must not be forgotten." Skinner, in short, appears to deny the phenomenon of modally mediated transfer, whereby reinforce- most of the relevant elementary skills is likely to perform precisely matching re- sponses following several demonstrations" ("Behavioral Modification Through Modeling Procedures," in RIBM, pp. 330-331). Obviously, research will be necessary to deter- mine not only the relevance of modeling techniques to the writing situation, but also what kind and level of modeling is appropriate to a given class situation. 44"Experimental Manipulation of Verbal Behavior: A Review," Journal of General Psychology, LXI (1959), 68-69.</page><page sequence="47">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 313 ment of one behavior or skill improves performance of another behavior or skill.45 Yet the concept of modality, and of intermodal transfer, is the cornerstone on which the whole talk-write pedagogy is built. And it is precisely at this point that the teacher of English who is interested in reconceptualizing his pedagogy finds that he is on his own. On the one hand, Skinner's Verbal Behavior makes everything from a lift of the shoulders or eyebrows through vocal activity to thinking "verbal": the concept of modality as an ordering principle and analytical tool does not appear.46 On the other hand, the verbal conditioning studies currently in progress are concentrated almost entirely in the verbal-vocal area, almost as if this were the only verbal modality by which humans communicated with each other or which could conceivably have psychological significance. If the verbal-scribal area is being ignored-and it is-this is because it is the vocal modality which figures in the traditional ther- apies, it is the vocal modality entirely which establishes the relationship between patient and therapist, and finally because conditioning studies in the vocal area offer the most immediate promise for the patient. Such facts go a long way toward delimiting an area of research for those interested in a compositional pedagogy which will involve something more than the reshuffling of the same stale concepts that we have been dealing with for hundreds of years. Very simply, we need to take a modal view of verbal be- havior. We need, in other words, to reconceptualize scribal activity as an autono- mous mode within the single larger area of behavior called verbal; we need to discover whether or not scribal activity has its own internal lawfulness sus- ceptible to analytical and descriptive attack; we need finally to determine to what extent scribal activity, while different from, is nonetheless related to, vocal activity, and to what extent this relationship between different-and- autonomous modalities is lawful (a kind of functional symbiosis is one possi- bility) and therefore also susceptible to analytical and descriptive attack. (And I must add parenthetically that all of this implies, of course, that we composition teachers had better stop sitting around waiting for the linguists to tell us what we ought to think about our peculiar area of interest, composition and rhetoric.) (2) The Problem of Historicity. The problem of modality leads directly and immediately to the problem of historicity. The talk-write pedagogy is essentially ahistorical on two different levels. Like all behavioral techniques, it is ahistorical with regard to the origin of scribal non-fluencies: it attacks the nonfluency-as- dysfunction, with no attention to originating cause. Much more to the point here, talk-write is philosophically ahistorical regarding the relationship between vocal and scribal activity: it handles both as equivalent modalities of verbal behavior. This places it in sharp contrast with the current think-write pedagogies, 45 BO, especially Ch. V, pp. 170ff; SHB, pp. 93-94. 46 VB, p. 14. Skinner does, in another context, deal briefly with a suggestive concept which he calls "crossmodal induction," but he means, unfortunately, modalities of stim- ulus presentation, not modalities of response (SHB, p. 136). The teacher of English tackling the problem of transfer had better be prepared to be both overwhelmed and bewildered. The literature is both enormous and contradictory, although the histor- ically arranged collection of articles, Transfer of Learning, ed. by Robert F. Grose and Robert C. Birney (New York, 1963), is probably a better place to start than most. As usual, he will find that when psychologists say "verbal" they mean "vocal": very little research appears to have been done on intrasystemic and intermodal transfer or induction in the vocal-scribal sector.</page><page sequence="48">314 COLLEGE ENGLISH which exhibit an historicity which has been largely confirmed by linguistic research. Indeed, one of the great anomalies of the current compositional situa- tion may be that the conceptual framework we have borrowed in part from linguistics is actually inhibitive of genuine progress in scribal pedagogy. The linguistic viewpoint is largely historico-descriptive. It is also, and as a conse- quence, pervasively hierarchic. The whole thrust of linguistic research is shaped by the fact that verbal-vocal activity came first historically, and verbal-scribal a very late second. Similarly, the growing child speaks long before he writes. From these macro- and micro-historical facts it follows (I oversimplify only slightly) that the sound-stream or free utterance is the "real" or "primary" or "only" language. Under such a rubric scribal activity cannot be regarded and is not regarded as an equivalent and autonomous activity, perhaps possessing its own, possibly unique interior lawfulness; it can only be regarded as a "second- ary" and entirely "derivative" activity within the verbal field, an imperfect and on many counts inadequate copy of the "real thing." My own feeling is that such a distribution of emphasis, and such a simplistic, polarized acceptance of an historically determined hierarchism as the only con- ceivable conceptual framework within which the writing activity can be under- stood is at the root of our present compositional difficulties. The teacher of literature, oddly enough, is quite at home with the idea of the literary work as autonomous artifact, with its own internal laws and mode of being. It never occurs to him to suggest that Hamlet or The Golden Bowl is in any substantive sense "derivative" from anything. Yet as soon as he steps into the composition classroom he adopts the hierarchic view of scribal activity on not one, but two, levels. On the one hand, under a thought-centered pedagogy, writing is the "ex- pression" of thought (which is what really counts). On the other hand, writing is a symbolic "representation" of the vocal sound-stream (which is also what really counts). Obviously, within such a conceptual framework, the veritable act of writing is not going to count for much. And this is perhaps the supreme value of a behavioral talk-write pedagogy: it forces us at last to come to terms with writing-as-action. (3) The Problem of Interiority. The very center of the talk-write pedagogy is that bit-of-behavior in the vocal modality which I have called the "cortical utterance" or "visceral blurt," in the course of which the student says what he has been unable to write. This is, I have suggested, the point d'appui from which a meaningful learning sequence in the scribal modality can be built. Behind this pedagogical approach lie at least two major assumptions. The first is that the student does indeed have ideas or thoughts or reactive stances-what you will-which he is for some reason unable to express scribally, but which are behaviorally released in the free utterance situation provided by the talk- write methodology. The second and much more crucial assumption is that thought (whatever that may be) and expression are in fact discrete, and that the former is temporally and causally anterior to the latter. The whole talk- write pedagogy, in short, is based on the assumption that there is somehow something "in" the student which we want, first vocally and then scribally, to "let out." These assumptions open up a philosophical and conceptual can of worms that I would much rather leave closed since I am more interested in teaching students to write effectively than I am in erecting philosophical superstructures</page><page sequence="49">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 315 to justify whatever success I have. But Martin Steinmann, following Gilbert Ryle, has recently published a theory of the relation of thought to expression so antithetical to the one which undergirds the talk-write pedagogy that it illuminates with peculiar clarity, if only by contrast, the philosophical sub- stratum of a behavioral attack on scribal activity. In search of a rhetorical "metatheory" which, presumably, will eventually yield a megarhetoric, Mr. Steinmann offers a sharply developed position regard- ing the relationship-or more precisely the non-relationship-between thought and expression: Thought and expression [Mr. Steinmann asserts] are inseparable; having a thought and giving it expression ... are not distinct, successive activities. One does not conceive a theory and then express it; he conceives it by expressing it; and, if he cannot express it, he doesn't have it.47 I am not certain that Mr. Steinmann actually sees the implications of the position he is taking here, but they are worth glancing at in order to clarify the be- havioral position on such matters. The obvious consequence of such a meta- theoretical formulation, of course, is the annihilation of thought in any traditional sense. "Expression," as I believe Mr. Steinmann is here using the term, be it speaking, writing, dancing, drawing, or simply laughing or weeping, is every- where and always, entirely and totally external and motoric: I cannot myself conceive of "expression" which is not physiological, or, more precisely, skeleto- muscular. If, then, we accept Mr. Steinmann's assertion that thought and expression are really one thing, inseparable, it inexorably follows that thought is entirely skeletomztscular. The point is important because a superficial view of behavioral theory might lead one to assume that the radical, grossly externalistic biologism of Mr. Steinmann's position is in consonance with the behavioral position on the knotty problem of "thought." But this is not the case. While the philosophical monism of behavioral theory, and the rigorous empiricism of its methodology tend to eliminate thought in the traditional "spiritual" or "mentalistic" sense, it does not follow that thought is eliminated in any sense-no behaviorist that I know of would go as far down the road to skeletomuscular monism as Mr. Steinmann does. For the fact is that behavioral theory recognizes the existence of a subdermal world. Skinner speaks of "the world within one's skin" in which the "private stimuli" of the interoceptive and proprioceptive "worlds" result in "covert" or "unemitted" behavior. "With respect of each individual," Skinner asserts, ". . a small part of the universe is private." And he makes the same point again, in relation to specifically verbal behavior: "A small but important part of the universe is enclosed within the skin of each individual and, so far as we know, is uniquely accessible to him." Ralph F. Hefferline points out, further, that "behavior acquired under exteroceptive control [parent-to-child language- learning is an example] may become controlled in whole or in part by response- produced stimuli [interoceptive and proprioceptive], and, when this occurs, it constitutes the process spoken of in other contexts as 'internalization.'" That such internalization takes place in the verbal-vocal area is evidenced by silent 47"Rhetorical Research," College English, XXVII (Jan. 1966), 278-285. 48SHB, Ch. XVII, "Private Events in a Natural Science," pp. 257-282; VB, p. 130.</page><page sequence="50">316 COLLEGE ENGLISH reading, for example, and also by the concept of "behavioral duplicity" where the individual "thinks" one thing while "saying" quite another. And indeed, the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) activity which has come to light in recent sleep research suggests on an entirely physiological basis the probable existence of an internalized reactive world beneath the skin, obviously carrying on a life of its own.49 The significance of this subdermal reactive world for the talk-write pedagogy is too obvious to require much comment. While behavioral theory will give the teacher of English no support at all for the humanistic conception of thought, it will nonetheless give him all the support he needs for the existence of some kind of internal activity anterior to expression, and upon which expression is dependent. In short, the assumption that there is something "in" the student which the talk-write pedagogy is designed to "let out" via the cortical utterance or visceral blurt appears to be in no way inconsonant with general behavioral theory. Moreover, this suggestion implicit in the talk-write pedagogy, that viable verbal configurations or semantic aggregates must exist somehow in the stu- dent anterior to any expression offers suggestive parallels to Noam Chomsky's speculations, in connection with the possibility of a universal grammar, con- cerning deep structure, which he defines as "the abstract underlying form which determines the meaning of the sentence; it is present in the mind but not necessarily represented directly in the physical signal." Such deep struc- ture, he asserts, is clearly distinguishable from surface structure, which he defines as "the actual organization of the physical signal into phrases of varying size, into words of various categories, with certain particles, inflections, arrange- ment, and so on." Chomsky's vocabulary and conceptual framework here are pervasively men- talistic; but it obviously would take only slight rephrasing of his definition of deep structure (one would want to do something about the word "abstract," and eliminate the reference to "mind" altogether) to give it a basically physio- logical cast and bring it into consonance with the concepts of "internalization" and "covertness" which one finds in behavioral theory. It may be, for example, that what I have rather crudely called the "cortical utterance" or "visceral blurt" is actually the most fundamental and least elaborated verbo-motoric ex- pression based on deep structure.;"? It is important to note, finally, that Chomsky's speculations provide at least a small escape hatch for those (I am one) who would not want to see scribal 49Ralph F.

The reader will have noticed that I am not about to be trapped into giving any definition of "thought" myself. There is a good reason: I do not know what thought is. It may be, as my humanistic heritage suggests, an elusive entity, spiri- tual or at least mental, supernatural or at least metanatural. On the other hand, it may be "no more than" an hyperelaborate synaptic twitch along the dark reaches of the interoceptive-proprioceptive interface. I do not know, and I am confident that the hon- est majority of my English colleagues would easily confess that they share my igno- rance. Such an admission, however, is pointless so long as we continue to teach, to con- struct compositional pedagogies, and to fabricate research proposals as if we did know.</page><page sequence="51">A BEHAVIORAL PEDAGOGY FOR COMPOSITION 317 activity lose its rationalist dimension in addition to its mentalistic foundation. He points out that it was a "rationalist philosophy of mind which provided the intellectual background" for the speculations of eighteenth-century theore- ticians concerning a universal grammar-and he suggests that a study of deep structure may lead to "conclusions regarding mental processes of very much the same sort" as those these committed rationalists arrived at."' Logic and ratio- nality, one is compelled to suggest, will be logic and rationality still, even if deep structure turns out to be entirely physiological, and universal grammar something programmed into the human organism by a couple of cunningly contrived nucleotide chains at one end of a helical molecule of DNA. To put the same issue another way, a behavioral approach to the act of writing, such as I have taken here, does not necessarily preclude a rational approach to the fact of writing. (4) The Problem of Freedom-is in my opinion no problem at all, and will therefore be dealt with summarily here. To assume that behavioral theory makes automatons of us all is to engage in the sort of comic-book oversimplifica- tion of very complex issues that we deprecate in student themes. Skinner, for example, accepts the concept of "self-control," while denying that it finds its source in any mentalistic "inner agent." This, of course, "reduces" self-control to an internalized response pattern dependent ultimately upon external stimu- lation, but it does not eliminate self-control. More broadly, the aim of operant behavioral theory and therapy is always to widen the individual's repertory of adaptive and useful behaviors. This is to set the individual free and to human- ize him, since breadth of behavioral repertory is, among other things, that which makes the human organism human. It is to make the dumb speak, the blind see, and the deaf hear. If behavioral theory successfully does this, then philosophical implications be damned.52 511bid., p. 590. 52The great bugaboo of a timorous and defensive humanism (the only sort which seems to be available in the latter half of the twentieth century) is the determinism implicit in the rigor- ously empirical methodology of behavioral science. The embattled humanist would have us believe that a deterministic world-view, with reality conceived of in terms of inexorably linked causal chains, means the end of human uniqueness, human dignity, and human freedom, and the death of both creativity and originality. Teachers of English seem to be especially prone to such philosophical hysteria, most probably because they have read Brave New World and 1984 late at night and when alone in the house, after a difficult day at the office devoted largely to theme-correction. Certainly the uncritical and totalistic acceptance of both of these novels by grown-up people who ought to know better reveals with particular vividness our central, and massively debilitating, professional hang-up: a neurotic fear of science, and a pious rejection of all its works and pomps. But it is possible we are being spooked by a straw-man. B. F. Skinner, in two superb essays on "The Creative Student" and "Discipline, Ethical Behavior, and Self-Control," both recently published for the first time in The Technology of Teaching, throws much-needed light on the things that go bump in the night, suggesting persuasively how freedom, creativity, and human uniqueness may all be preserved within a rigorously deterministic world-view. "There is nothing in a deterministic position," he points out, "... which questions a man's absolute uniqueness. Every human being is the product of a genetic endowment and an environmental history which are peculiarly his own." Moreover, Skinner sees acceptance of a deterministic philosophical position as an essential first step in developing a consistently effective pedagogy. "Determinism is a useful assumption because it encourages a search for causes. A man who believes that the volume of a gas changes capriciously will not look for the cause of every change he observes and will be less likely to discover the laws which govern volume. A teacher who believes that a student creates a work of art by exercising some inner, capricious faculty will not look for the conditions under which he does in fact do creative work. He will also be less able to explain such work when it occurs</page><page sequence="52">318 COLLEGE ENGLISH XIII My English teacher's (no doubt naive) faith in the efficacy of the thesis sentence leads me to make the following summation: ft is my thesis that many of the scribal non-fluencies we encounter on the college level are attributable in large part to a faulty or disjunctive vocal-to- scribal motor-modal "weld," a condition which (at least half-seriously) I call schizokinetic scribophobia, a term which describes a reactive stance toward the writing situation which is often adaptive on the high school level but which generally becomes maladaptive on the college level; correction demands the superimposition of a behavioral dimension upon our present think-write pedagogy, involving the transmodal manipulation of successive vocal-to-scribal approximations derived by autogenetic specification within a framework of vari- able reinforcement. That's the whole ball of wax in a single sentence. The attitudes which I hope my colleagues will not take toward this formula- tion are suggested by the editors of Research in Behavior Modification, following Sutcliffe, with regard to hypnosis (which is probably even more encrusted with fuzzy theorizing than English composition). They remark that people tend to take two wildly divergent attitudes toward the somewhat mysterious phenomenon of hypnosis. They are either entirely skeptical, or they are entirely credulous- there is seldom any middle ground. And the editors add that this skeptical- credulous dichotomy is operative in many other "social influence" situations.53 My point is that neither credulity or skepticism is really an appropriate response to my talk-write thesis. Instead, what is needed at this point is research of a sort which most teachers of English are not well prepared to prosecute. We will need the help of the learning theorists, but we won't get it unless we can approach them with precisely formulated questions. We need to know, for example, if there is such a thing as verbal-scribal conditioning analogous, perhaps, to verbal-vocal conditioning, and possibly susceptible to analysis by the same methodology. If scribal conditioning is a valid concept, then studies are needed to illuminate the role of the teacher of English as scribal conditioner, and we need to develop techniques for describing the way in which such con- ditioners make their influence manifest in the scribal artifact. Following the leads offered by such post-Rickoverian critics of the schools as Edgar Z. Friedenberg, we need to determine whether scribal responses which are considered maladaptive on the college level are in fact adaptive on the high school level and perhaps earlier. Such a study will involve a search for possible cultural factors which could conceivably lead many students into a "scribal duplicity" similar to the "behavioral duplicity" already mentioned, or to the scribal suppression and scribal ritualism discussed earlier in this study. Taking an entirely different tack, but directing our efforts to much the same area, we will have to determine if intrasvstemic schizokinesis is in fact an empirically viable concept for describing the dichotomized nature of many students' verbal behavior. If it is, then we will need to determine if something and less likely to induce students to behave creatively" (TT, pp. 170-171). One suspects that it is this which most teachers of English will find hardest to give up: the concept of a capricious, causally autonomous "inner agent" invisibly at work in the scribal process. 53Leonard Krasner and Leonard P. Ullmann, eds., in RIBM, p. 341, from J. P.

We need further to throw whatever light we can on the motoric elements of the scribal act, determining whether scribal non-fluencies are in any way analogous to vocal non-fluencies and possibly open to the same sort of thera- peutic attack: is there, in short, su.ch a thing as a scribal stutter? And finally, we need to develop experimental pedagogies at all levels, per- haps similar in some respects to the one I have outlined here, which make con- trolled application of operant learning principles,54 and which we can try out in the composition classroom on an entirely pragmatic basis, integrating them into the established procedures of the traditional composition course. In all of this, we should not expect quick success. Nothing that I have said here should be taken as suggesting that operant learning principles promise a single-quarter or single-semester "cure" for any writing problem. The white rat may be shaped in minutes or even seconds, but, as Arthur W. Staats points out, human beings are another kettle of behavior: ... We cannot expect to restore the word salad of the schizophrenic to high-level communication and good language behavior in reasoning through short-term pro- cedure. There are many behaviors, such as the original acquisition of speech, the acquisition of reading, the development of complex social behaviors, work behaviors, ... which are acquired, or are not acquired, only over a period of many years.... A belief that the operant shaping of a simple behavior in a short time indicates that all behaviors will fall into place this way is unrealistic.55 Moreover, we must not expect that either infrahuman learning theory or its application in strictly clinical and experimental situations will provide us directly with any precise answers to the problems specifically related to the scribal act itself. The most we can expect is that such theory and experimentation will help us formulate the right questions. "Learning theory can offer us some principles," Frederick H. Kanfer remarks, "a conceptual schema, and a method- ology as a starting point. The empirical content, however, will have to come from research conducted directly on the phenomena which we wish to under- stand."56 Finally, while I have not touched on the subject at all here, evidence from many quarters suggests that we may now be in the middle of a historico- cultural shift or fracture even more radical than the one which Henry Adams thought he saw in the Paris Exposition of 1900. Scientific and empirical con- siderations aside, one begins to suspect that an entirely intellective, rational, representational, linear, serial, and essentially asocial pedagogy, stressing private thinking and private writing with little or rio attention to voice, may be be- coming less and less relevant to the cultural configurations within which our students will have to lead their lives. One does not have to agree with every- thing that Marshall McLuhan has written in order to accept Walter J. Ong's assessment of the electronic age: "By contrast with the tendencies of the chirographic and typographic cultures to quiet voice and produce the isolated 54For such an application, perhaps somewhat loosely conceived, see Lynn Z.

A timorous and tentative refurbishing of the old familiar conceptual frame- work will not do the job. As George H. Henry has pointed out in an incisive College English article which said most of the hard things many English teachers would prefer not to hear, genuine progress in English or any other field can only be made on the basis of the "outrageous hypothesis."58 I have the feeling that many of my colleagues will find my own hypothesis-that there is a roden- tial dimension to the scribal act-more than sufficiently outrageous. 57"Literature, Threat and Conquest," College English, XXVII (May, 1966), 622. 58"English Teaching Encounters Science," CE, XXVIII (December, 1966), 234.</page></plain_text>
