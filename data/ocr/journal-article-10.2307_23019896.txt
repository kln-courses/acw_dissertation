<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Language of Eldorado by Mark McWatt. Dangaroo Press, 1994, 79 pages. Mark McWatt's second collection of poems, The Language of Eldorado (1994), follows the path blazed in his first collection, Interiors (1988). The relationship between landscape and psyche that Wilson Harris explores in his fiction, and which is imaged in the term, "heartland", is a recurring concern in both collections but Interiors's discrete vignettes are more con cerned with evoking a fusion of memories and place to the extent that the latter is appropriated as an emotion. Hence the intensity of a poem like "Morawhanna" which conflates place, return, nostalgia, and loss as McWatt "names that love for a dead father", which inheres in the place, Morawhan na. The Language of Eldorado surveys the same terrain but its focus is also archaeological in the Harrisian sense of the word. The poems of Interiors are alert to the clues of a "phenomenal legacy" like the indecipherable "intimations of eldorado" ("Porknocker"), or the ghostly aboriginal presence in "The Native of Secrets" that speaks out of a history of ruin, conquest, catastrophe, and ghost armies; but The Language of Eldorado seeks to go beyond intimations into an understanding of language, landscape and psyche that is indebted to Wilson Harris's concepts about native and phenomenal environment, and language as both medium and vision of consciousness. The Language of Eldorado is divided into six sections: "Prolog", "Rivers of Dream, "Under the Children, "The Language of Eldorado", "Masks With Voices", and "A Potaro Quartet". "Prolog" functions as both a prologue, in the theatrical sense, and as a pro-log, the beginnings of a logbook. Its single poem, "Then", is a poetic recapitulation of the history of the Americas, continental heartlands and the islands, in a manner reminiscent of both the poetic geologies and histories of Kamau Brathwaite and Derek Walcott. Harris's influence is also there but McWatt's voice and vision are thorough ly his own. Unlike Brathwaite, Walcott, and Harris, he does not elaborate sweeping histories and cosmologies but instead explores private concerns and obsessions by using the full range of conceptual resources that have been elaborated by Caribbean writers. Thus "Then" recounts, with feeling but without polemical fury, the history of our Americas, from prehistoric times ("of flesh too fragile for history") through Amerindian settlement, the hierarchical sun-centred civilisations with their fetishising of sacrifice and sacred time ("Then /the red urgency of blood, creating/ the sacrificial time, the fascinated order/and languages only the sun can read") to the "osmotic assault/of the history-mongering tribes/of Europe", the depredations of 100 Journal of West Indian Literature</page><page sequence="2">conquest, the pillage of "divine gold and silver", the advent of the cruel regime of plantation slavery, and finally the failure of postcolonial societies to realize the promise of independence "as all the human crops fail in islands /and continents". McWatt's vision of postcolonial failure is however informed by the possibilities of dream and vision that are subsumed within the "single endless thread/of blood-red light from which/the sun is still suspended." The Mesoamerican myth that human sacrifice was essential to prevent the sun, and hence time itself, from being devoured, informs these lines. There is no final statement, only the indeterminacy of ellipsis, "And then...", an ending which is not an ending, but instead a space of new beginnings. The Language of Eldorado charts these beginnings within a musical structure in which "Rivers of Dream", "The Language of Eldorado", and "A Potaro Quartet" elaborate the central themes of the interpenetration of landscape, psyche, history, language, and the imagination. "Under the Children" and "Masks With Voices" are the movements which contain what the poet terms "the more accessible poems dealing with childhood riddles and experiences and the drama of everyday domestic situations and imper sonations" ('Preface'). McWatt's preoccupations are varied but they are all linked by a particular approach to language as a kind of verbal sculpture hollowed by light, and contrasting spaces, an oneiric medium that trans lates reverie and reality into an indefinable realm where psychic and geographical heartlands merge. Language, in McWatt's work, strives to attain what Wilson Harris describes as its "peculiar reality", the incessant transformation of "inner and outer formal categories of experience" by its "continuous inward revisionary and momentous logic of potent explosive images evoked in the mind."1 Some of the above qualities are evident in the dreamscapes of poems such as "Rivers of Dream", "The Straits of Heaven", and "The Language of Eldorado"; the spatial and imaginative densities of "Amakura", "Nightfall: Kangaruma", "Plunge Pool: Amatuk", and "Gorge," that blend memory and musing with the overwhelming transformative experience of place. One is constantly reminded of Harris when reading these poems not only because of McWatt"s overt debt to the older Guyanese writer but also because of a shared sensibility to place, psyche, history, and language. Both writers dislocate the "open myth of El Dorado"2 from its linear historical context of conquest, exploitation, and materialistic fetishism ,in order to recuperate its illuminatory potential. Hence Harris's protagonists re-live and reverse the traumas of conquest and catastrophe in the context of a landscape that peels away their inherited roles and biases, and McWatt undertakes poetic Vol. 7, No.I 101</page><page sequence="3">odysseys into various interiors (psychic and geographical) in search of the Grail of language, the secret language of Eldorado which is a confluence of word, desire, dream, memory, place, and imagination, a condition that centres the poet, "the fisherman of words", in the universe. It is this aware ness that illuminates the conclusion of the title poem: And home is not the charisma of text, but the shape of each word that rolls from his tongue, framing the songs of his mother and son the galloping song and the song of the flute and the songs that tell that his task is done, or is nearly done, or is never done... And we call this home of his own desire the secret language of the golden man. ("The Language of Eldorado ) Unlike Harris's poetry, which too often sacrifices the sensuous im mediacy of the concrete image for conceptual abstraction, McWatt maintains a balance between image and idea, and builds on the techniques that worked so well in Interiors: the carefully crafted brooding intensity; the strong sense of place in both material and immaterial terms; a deft narrative touch that can suggest multilayered stories with verbal precision and economy; and an appreciation of the primacy of the image in poetry. Images of light and dark pervade The Language of Eldorado and lend their own visual architectonic to the poet's explorations of mental and physical spaces. "Amakura" captures the elemental atmosphere of the Guyanese interior by its graphic imaging of the half-light of the forest, and the black water of the rivers: Spokes of dusty light descended from a hub above the trees and pierced the black skin the river. Light and dark are two of the creative oppositions running throughout "Amakura". Speech and silence are also juxtaposed in this poetic explora tion of the meaning of a place, accessible only through memory, and the language of place that has become a part of the poet's own "interior space". 102 journal of West Indian Literature</page><page sequence="4">There are several light/dark oppositions throughout this collection and they range from the "Mist on the morning river" that is torn by the "bright dog of sunlight", in "The Native of Questions", to the play of nightfall and firelight in "Nightfall: Kangaruma". These oppositions convey the multiple resonances that arise out of the relationship between place and psyche, the condition of belonging or unbelonging, the estrangement of the familiar, and the familiarity of the unknown. Thus the interplay of light and mist in "The Native of Questions" highlights the persona's problematic relation ship to place, and his status as native: Mist on the morning river summons a spirit of questioning like the dawn of revolution, as your paddle cuts water and space like a knife of cold laughter opening a vein of memory What place is this whose shape the mist erases? Can it ever be sculpted again into the clarity of home? Nightfall, dawn, and the filtered half-light of forests also function as metaphors of the shadowy inner landscapes of memory, and imagination. They also evoke the post-quantum architectonics, the interplay of space, opacities and clarities of the Harrisian journey into heartland and nameless primordial territories. McWatt's poems articulate the shifting spectrum of dreams, memories, and musings that inform history and landscape with meanings that vary from the fusion of primordial, historical, and personal themes, in "The Language of Eldorado", to the individual assertion of memory as the end of all quests, in "Observing Children": "Memory was the end of all his quests./dry memories..." McWatt also displays a fair degree of thematic and stylistic variety in this collection. The tonal range of The Language of Eldorado encompasses the musing dreamlike densities of the El Doradan quest; the riddling and dramatic evocations of childhood and domestic experiences; and the literary echoes of other writers. It is a sign of McWatt's quiet confidence that he unreservedly acknowledges his influences while still maintaining his distinct poetic tenor. Thus "A Poem at Baramanni" uses the familiar Walcottian figure of the landscape as a page to wrestle with the issues of poetic creation, and "Four Poems in the Mariner of Mervyn Morris" is couched in the precise ironic minimalism of the Jamaican poet, Mervyn Vol. 7, No. 1 103</page><page sequence="5">Morris, with cameos that are redolent of intense emotions behind the austere formal structures. In this second collection, McWatt reconciles the primordial epic quest for the secret language of Eldorado with the quotidian task of making "all the little noises of a life" ("Bonesong for a Silent Poet"). The ineffable and fluid vestiges of memory and dream are grounded in the concrete realities of place to produce anthropomorphic landscapes that are informed by the paradoxes of possession and loss, exile and return. The secret language of Eldorado is a language beyond language, a silence beyond words; it is the certainty of "numinous proportions" that inhabit landscapes and lives, a certainty that is evoked in "Heartland's" conclusion: Although it often seems we live so that reason can erase the numinous glyphs of love inscribed in every landscape, There is something there, after all, that is the central spider in our web of dreams, that weaves the net of Eldorado, that launches the drunken boat... There is something, other than the setting sun, that catches the river afire. It is this faith in numinous essence that lends a sacramental quality to poems such as "Ibis", "The Straits of Heaven", "The Palms in Le Repentir", and "Benediction". "Ibis" is an excellent 'nature' poem that derives its power from the allegorical and emblematic rendering of a flock of ibis as "twin themes of an old desire:/the blood of God and the heart of man". The numinous is evoked through precise concrete particulars of colour: white cloud, red ibis, green and gold mangroves; and it is this blend of the abstract and the concrete that signals McWatt's mastery of the logic of imagery. He is able to conflate the geography of the imagination with actual landscapes, and to suggest their equally fluid configurations, their shifting boundaries, their perpetual mobilities like the "rivers of dream" that confound the complacencies of the subject in "Rivers of Dream". Rivers run throughout many of the poems of The Language of Eldorado and their ubiquity derives from the riverine topography of Guyana's 104 Journal of'West Indian Literature</page><page sequence="6">interior. Wilson Harris's fiction has imaginatively sounded and surveyed this Guyanese heartland by transforming its features into devices of dis location and fragmentation. McWatt's poems are also imaginative explorations that seek to chart more personal maps of this fluvial landscape where rivers provide access to a vast hinterland. These poems are in a real sense about the process of re-placing: establishing one's relationship to place through memories, and charting aspects of psyche that are configured within place. Eldorado is not a real place but it is also every place that ensures our becoming native; it is both mind map and actual rock, water and forest. McWatt's poems remind us of the complementarities of mind and matter, place and person, language and the world. "Gorge" is the last poem in this collection and it blends topography, writing, personal and national history into an appropriate indeterminate coda. The poet trans lates landscape into a metaphor of self, an "inner country"that subsists on retrospection and reflection but which is attuned to the harsh social and political realities of postcolonial Guyana. McWatt plays on the different meanings of "gorge" to evoke the nexus of relationships between state and citizens, blighted dreams and stubborn hopes, transience and permanence. Like the penultimate chapter of Derek Walcott's Another Life, "Gorge" ends with a blessing, a reaffirmation of faith which is perhaps the only language of Eldorado: My country gorges itself on all like me, as this river subsists on rock and memory. Peace. A soft Sanctus from lips of the living somehow reaches me and hallows this place where I cling to the wet skirt of a waterfall: (despite the poet) all are not consumed. Not yet. "Not yet' defers finality in a similar manner to "Prolog's' elliptical And then..." The language of Eldorado will go on seeking its text, and one hopes that McWatt will continue to translate its secrets for us. Notes 1. Wilson Harris.
