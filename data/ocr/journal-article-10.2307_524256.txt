<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Process of Urbanization in Africa (From the Origins to the Beginning of Independence)* Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch The concept of the city on the sub-Saharan continent presents a vast field of study whose limits we must define. Urbanization entails spatial, social, and temporal phenomena and thus almost by defini- tion requires an interdisciplinary approach. Such an approach could certainly encompass history, geography, demographics, economics, political science, architecture and town planning, as well as anthro- pology and sociology. The interdisciplinary study of urbanization deserves emphasis because the research conducted in these different directions over the course of the past twenty-five years has been very uneven. We must not confuse the concepts of urbanization and mod- ernization, although to distinguish the difference between the two can be a delicate matter. Since the colonial intrusion, the importance of making such a distinction is all the greater because the develop- ment of the former notion was subsumed by that of the latter.1 Another remark: The author's personality, in writing this overview paper, is obviously present. As a piece of work written by an historian, this text takes into account the past of African cities and their evolutionary process, from their pristine origins to the eve of independence. This paper is mainly about the past, it touches only oc- casionally on the characteristics of modern African towns since independence and their likely future; in spite of social sciences constituting a whole, an individual cannot grasp everything. The analyses devoted to town planning and urban economics have been left to another specialist.2 In conformity with the author's education and interests, temporal dimensions will receive priority over transversal conceptual divisions; thus, the concept of time and change will tend to be neglected. Even though the concept of city is ascertained here as universal, both in time and space, it is a concept which evolves rather than one which possesses permanent features transcending periodization. From the beginning, cities have been nodes of certain types of structures and relationships within regions. But the conditions which shape these structures and their relationship with the envi- ronment have changed over time, making it difficult to compare, let us say, the emergence of Swahili cities in medieval times to the African Studies Review, Volume 34, Number 1 (April 1991), pp. 1-98.</page><page sequence="2">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW mushrooming of the massive cities of today. For example, a preindus- trial city could not exist without a relatively close agricultural hinterland to support the subsistence of its inhabitants. Modern metropoles import huge quantities of foodstuffs from developed countries all over the world. Cities are universal, but conditions for urbanization have changed; therefore, the relationships between town and countryside which have always existed still exist, though leading factors and incentives are no longer the same. In each his- torical phase, in each social and economic formation, certain types of urbanization emerged. Schematically, through time and space, we can distinguish: -Prevalent types of production and exchange, or modes of production, for example a domestic lineage system based on subsistence, or a system based on a slave-derived social and economic organization, or a trading system combining slav- ery and mercantilism, or a capitalist system. -Given patterns of power and ideology, which also help to structure and maintain it, will correspond to each of these modes, due largely to a religious mindset in preindustrial so- cieties, or the scientific and technological apparatus of modern capitalist societies. -From every society, from every system of power and of thought, specific models of cities develop. This process of ur- banization reflects and reveals the global organization of the whole group. Thus urbanism and urban planning are the factual and spatial expressions of a social process of urbanization which changes over time. So, first of all, we need to clarify the ways in which re- searchers have approached, understood, and interpreted the very con- cept of urbanization in Africa. In this task we have a multiplicity of choices. The second part of the paper is guided by the nature of the available works, most of which refer to a specific perod: for example, ancient cities, precolonial cities, Islamic cities, colonial cities. It is exceptional for the same author to approach all these different stages with a comparable methodology. The historical dimension puts the emphasis on disparities of urbanization over time rather than on its common features. Thus the question remains as to whether within this time-related diversity, a longue-durde understanding is possible, and whether there exists, through precolonial and post-colonial eras, an enduring urban reality which has shaped patterns of urbanization in Africa. From ancient cities to post-colonial ones, we will try to identify both endurance and change in the process of urbanization. 2</page><page sequence="3">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Finally, the third section examines forms of urban change from the end of the 19th century. This is obviously a major focus of socio- logical studies of urbanization. Unfortunately, the existing material offered by scholars does not allow us to ask similar questions in a de- tailed manner about a more remote past. Social change and urban- rural relationships in ancient or medieval cities may be guessed from several acute studies, but the material collected neither results from the same kinds of investigation (for example, archeological ev- idence versus oral sociological fieldwork) nor conforms with the same sort of questioning. Therefore it seems more reasonable to focus here on the timespan actually embraced by anthropological, sociologi- cal, political, and urban-planning studies: mostly from the 19th century onwards. This means covering the immediate precolonial, colonial, and post-colonial times, and only occasionally tracing back to the former Portuguese or medieval Muslim heritage. There is no reason though why we cannot attempt to develop some generalized proposals for the longue-durde, hence, the necessity to question the va- lidity of concepts such as a new colonial city, or a recent informal sector, simply because they have been discovered recently, and thereby attributed this label. The last point is to note and accept the particularity of the author's position, in part attributable to her nationality: French dis- cussants have a tendency to explore topics from a variety of angles, and to see the limitations as well as the virtues of different ap- proaches. (However profound my knowledge of anglophone urban literature may be, it is supported by the tradition of French theory.) My viewpoint has been to deny any kind of intellectual privilege to any analytical tradition, including my own preferences, (supposedly Marxist). Thence there will be evident a certain reluctance to adopt any one theory of urbanization and a tendency to pick up ideas from everywhere, even if my own inclinations are sufficiently well known to be slightly caricatured. Historians have pragmatic minds. They are always reluctant to impose a theory on reality, and they are often attentive when events disagree with theories, or parts of theo- ries, precisely because models necessarily generalize and schematize. I will try in this paper to compensate for my eclecticism through organization and clarity, though of course I am not sure I can meet the challenge. Definitions and Theoretical Proposals on the Nature of Urbanization First we must be clear: A city never stands alone. Even in the limited case of a city-state (such as Hausaland as analyzed below), a city supposes a coupling: city and countryside. The distinction be- tween the two is sometimes obscure: Are suburbs (especially for mod- ern cities) part of the former or of the latter? What about, for example, 3</page><page sequence="4">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW the recent French concepts of rurbanization and of "ruralization of cities" (Stren, 1986)? Obviously the relationship between the component parts of rural and urban settlements is not easy to define. Nevertheless, this overview paper addresses urbanization, which is not, as we shall see, to be reduced to the exchanges, oppositions, or confusions between town and country, or between rural dwellers and urbanites, even if a city is a focal point inside a region and can be understood not only by itself but also (though not only) as a center of a network (of other cities, smaller urban centers, and a whole re- gion, including its rural parts). This is why rural realities will of necessity be present here, although supposedly known, and considered only in their relationship to urban ones. For, in spite of the rather famous article, "The Concept of Urbanism" (Wheatley, 1972), a city and its process is not a concept, but a reality. Ask people, they will always answer clearly and without hesitating whether or not they live in town (de Maximy, 1988: 12). Why? This question is more difficult; it is one thing to recognize a reality, yet another to define it. To define what a city is has obviously been quite a problem. There have been various successive approaches to the conceptualization of the city in history, anthropology, and geography, not to mention architecture or city planning, in general and in Africa in particular. They have hovered explicitly or implicitly between suggesting a specific approach and a universal one. For example, the former deals with the Mediterranean city and civilization, the sup- posed urban-rural continuum in Africa, the preindustrial city. Here you find many oppositions: politics and religion versus economics, para- sitic city versus generative one, preindustrial versus industrial, precapitalist versus capitalist. Thence, some authors have attempted to prove that urbanization cannot be found in Africa (even in Yorubaland) before the advent of the West; others, not necessarily more convincingly, have argued the contrary. Let us examine these perceptions in more detail. Previous Definitions Historians first explored the concept of city in history outside of Africa which was conceived as an entirely rural world. Every histo- rian had a tendency to privilege and stress criteria which best adapted to the cities he or she encountered in his (or her) own field- work, hence the splintering of the definition and, often, its inadequacy with regard to Africa. With the exception of Max Weber (1921), the great precursor, historians of Western cities were those who first attempted to define the concept, starting from an urban revolution correlative to the Neolithic revolution. The emergence of agriculture allowed for the accumulation of surpluses in the primary cities where civilization blossomed, as opposed to the barbarism of savage life based on wild food (Childe, 1950). In his archeological work, Gordon Childe defined, from his knowledge of Mesopotamia, ten criteria for urbanization, 4</page><page sequence="5">The Process of Urbanization in Africa beginning with the adoption of writing as a necessary base for ad- ministration and the use of arithmetic. That is to say that Africa without writing was, de facto, excluded. As Wheatley underlines it: Although he was ostensibly investigating a process-which he termed the Urban Revolution-he succeeded only in demarcating a stage [of urban development] (Wheatley, 1972: 612). Childe is quite conscious of the imprecision of his proposals; he insists on the analogical character of the city, which, in his view "was not a single, catastrophic event, but a slow, continuous [cumulative] process whose culmination could be defined only arbi- trarily" (1957: 36-37). Therefore it may be "arbitrary to choose writing as marking the critical point." He knew some other classicists found it a rather unsatisfactory criterion (see Wheeler, 1956): "But what is the alternative? The criterion cannot be mere size" (Childe, 1957). Fernand Braudel insisted upon the universal character of the city, which is a town wherever it is, as "only primitive or undevel- oped societies have not experienced the urban phenomenon . . . [but] even Black Africa 3 had its towns" (1973: chap. 8). He underlines the necessity to offer a definition general enough to embody all urban phenomena. However he finds the city's quintessence in modern mercantilist society, thanks to an expanding monetary economy. Thus he emphazises the monetary instrument and the use of cash as criteria, accepting a relatively narrow definition. He is then able to ascertain that European towns: had been brought to a standard hardly found anywhere else .... The miracle of the first great urban centuries in Europe was that the town won entirely .... This was a colossal event. These examples demonstrate how difficult it is to speak of cities, or at least of a true city in the precolonial African era, accord- ing to all these authors who have in mind the Western Mediterranean model. To give literate primacy such a deliberate importance sounds rather surprising today, even though it was a gen- erally shared opinion at the time. It caused several scholars to overstate their assertions in spite of their knowledge and specializa- tion in non-Western societies: for example Gideon Sjoberg (1955, 1960), whose thesis caused a lot of commotion. Sjoberg differentiates premodern towns of all preindustrial societies from the industrial metropolis which emerged from the 19th-century technological revolution. He establishes an urban hierarchy, systemizing quasi- mechanically Gordon Childe's (1950) proposals: If urbanization is a proof of civilization, only literate preindustrial societies can claim to be civilized. He suggests for them as a synonym, "preindustrial civi- lized societies," that is, societies which have advanced beyond a certain number of stages, among which writing is given as a sine qua non condition (1950: 10). Childe contends that in addition to size, 5</page><page sequence="6">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW heterogeneity, public works, and so on, writing is essential to the cat- egorization of the city, implying as it does the existence of a highly specialized non-agricultural group that has the necessary leisure to develop such a complex skill. I agree. Sjoberg makes few references to Africa. He mentions only "the traditional Dahomey, Ashanti, or Yoruba in Africa, which we must also class as "quasi-urban" (1960: 33). His method leads him to make absurd classifications: the Mayas would have been attributed, owing to their writing, an urban status while the Inca communities are rel- egated to a marginal or at best transitional status, merely because they apparently lacked writing. Historians refuted his viewpoint rather quickly. Wheatly (1963: 166) blamed him for his Western pre- disposition which prompted him, like Max Weber, to ascertain: "outside the Occident there have not been cities in the sense of a unitary community" (Weber, 1921: 88). He emphasizes how Sjoberg does not feel at home with historical sources but, strangely enough, in spite of his African competence, he does not attack him on this very point. Indeed an urban vision of Africa was still quite unusual at that time. We had to wait for the beginning of the 1970s to get Wheatly's position on Yoruba urbanization (1970, 1972). The major reproach against Sjoberg was that he remained stuck within the folk-urban continuum (Cox, 1964), which results in the pre- sentation of the preindustrial city as a negative construct. The formulation of the folk-urban continuum dates back to the 1930s (see a useful survey in Horvath, 1969a). Derived from the works of the an- thropologist Robert Redfield (1930) on rural Mexico and from the sociologist Louis Wirth's perceptions of American cities (1938), in particular Chicago, on the urban end, the folk-urban continuum be- came a widely accepted theory of urbanization among American scholars during the 1930s and 1940s (Redfield, 1947). A long dialogue ensued which resulted in the refutation of the concept as an adequate theory of culture or urbanization (Miner, 1952; Benet, 1963; McGee, 1964, 1971; Horvath, 1969a). The "Rural-Urban Continuum" probably was a useful theory in its time, but it had an ultimately inhibiting influence on African urban anthropology. It was symptomatic of a broader approach in the social sciences that derived from the assumption of a polarity be- tween so-called traditional societies (by definition rural ones: the folk society) and (urban) modern societies (compare. Yusuf, 1974). It pre- sumed the urban model to be the exact opposite of the folk model. It was an Anglophone equivalent for the Francophone societd tradition- nelle, thought by former colonial ethnologists to have been stable for centuries. In a way though, the continuum theory did represent a transition in European schorlarship from the belief that urban Africa was inconceivable to the supposition that it was both possible and desirable. It went hand in hand with the position of modernization theorists in the 1950s, who believed that modernity was possible in 6</page><page sequence="7">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Africa and therefore made the most disparaging case against those Africans who had not attained modernity. The apparent advantage of this theory was that it offered a global explanation for a number of phenomena, including rural-ur- ban migrations and apparently dichotic rural and urban ideologies and cultures, the folk society being that society in which the techni- cal order is subordinated within the moral order, and the city being the source of change (McGee, 1964: 165). In fact, this dualism hindered efforts to reach a synthesis (Benet, 1963). It was a direct in- heritance of colonialism, whose basic conception of African society was to see the rural society as "the repository of the true Africa, naturally tranquil and immutable," but whose ideas had been con- tradicted as early as the 1930s by the emergence of a stable organized urban labor force (Cooper, 1987: 248-250). This reasoning was ahistori- cal; except for unusual cases of closed (autarchic) societies, a social process is always also a cross-cultural process and, in this latter process, the role of cities prevailed. Some years later, Redfield and Singer offered a more nuanced approach: instead of dualism, they distinguished a trichotomy through urbanization. The first part remained the untouched folk so- ciety ("that imagined combination of societal elements which would characterize a long-established, homogeneous, isolated, and non- literate integral [self-contained] community") which was necessar- ily rural (p. 58). The second generated from an "orthogenic transformation," that is, a primary urbanization. The third was the "modern" one, when a "heterogenetic transformation" gave rise to a secondary urbanization. A stable and homogeneous folk society could sometimes produce a genuine "primary urbanization," as a natural outgrowth of the cultural traditions of its surrounding hinterlands protected from external influences coming from abroad, but a "true" secondary urbanization, as the result of foreign interrelationships, was the privilege of developed societies (Redfield and Singer, 1954-55). Even before this article's publication, at least one Africanist attempted to test the theory, with a method which today is rather sur- prising: Horace Miner tried to select a pristine African city. He chose Timbuctoo. He then decided arbitrarily that, because colonization was recent, it had been free from Euro-Western influence. He was ready to "discover if the society is well-organized, sacred, and personal, like the folk societies or if it is disorganized, secular, and impersonal like our urban society" (Miner, 1953: xii). As a case study, it is good ethnography. As a theory, it sounds today so ahistorical that it is not even worth recounting the results. The opposition proposed by Sjoberg--of the preindustrial versus industrial city-seems rather formal. Marxist scholars put the debate on the surer historical premises generated by the famous "Modes of Production" debate in the late 1960s. The privileged variants were at end simplified so as to make a sharp distinction between a precapi- talist versus capitalist situation (Giddens, 1981). According to Giddens, 7</page><page sequence="8">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW the significance of space in precapitalist and capitalist situations would not be the same; in the former, the city appears as a locus of power, being the spatial construct in which power is concentrated, the privileged city being the capital city (even if city is not the same as state). With the development of capitalism, however, a single so- cial process, the market, transcends the distinction between rural and urban; in capitalism, all labor power is commodified, and commodities exist independently of location and of political power. Active as I was in the debate on modes of production, and because of my recent conviction of the global pertinence of the main opposition between precapitalist and capitalist modes, I obviously feel drawn to this proposal, even if my historical mind reacts against cer- tain mechanisms of structuralist materialism. Nevertheless, I would emphasize rather the duration of a long transitional time when mer- cantilism (in European cities) and the slave and commodity market (in African ones) largely predated industrial capitalism. The devel- opment of a dependent capitalism was in Africa as much a process as in Europe; it changed and strengthened over time. We are no longer so certain that dependent capitalism developed in Africa "in pockets" rather than "within a seamless web enveloping all of society" (Cooper, 1983: 17). Moreover, even if the economic process obviously integrates town and country, modern African cities appear, even more than in precolonial times, to be the locus of power. It was true for the colonial city, used as such, that is, as a tool for colonialism; it may be still truer for cities of today, which are more than ever cen- ters of dominance (Miner, 1967: 5-10; Wheatly, 1972: 613-14). Some isolated researchers, albeit a minority, began some years ago to question the reality of a naturally "rural" Africa, of a necessar- ily "parasitic" premodern urbanization, and of the evidence of only "villages" existing, such as in precolonial Ghana. Industrial Europe tended to cultivate a romantic concept of the village in which is embodied the ideas of permanence and links with the past, embodied for example in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's le bon sauvage. The example of India has shown how this myth of a communal and egalitarian village, so contrary to the reality of a gerontocratic and caste social system, was born in England during the second half of the 18th cen- tury and flourished in the romantic period with the idealization of rural values which contrasted with the new brutality contained in industrial cities. The village became a repository of the past virtues untouched by modern aggressions (Pouchepadass, 1981). This belief was resilient, for it still flourished in the 1970s under the form of the "urban bias" and of "overurbanization," which "explained" why ur- ban misery coexisted with rural poverty. Even if Lipton does not really adopt a moralist's position, his view is implicitly judgemental, contrary to the modernization theorists in the 1950s, the city was evil, and a remedy to poverty was to halt this unceasing urban tide (1976). In a provocative way, it was then asserted that "in Africa, to associate the village with permanence-at least as regards the past- 8</page><page sequence="9">The Process of Urbanization in Africa is probably even more unrealistic" than in Europe. History and archeology help when considering the village in West Africa as an evolving social collectivity (O'Loughlin, 1972). We may think that the village has been able, as in the West, to evolve in some cases towards urban forms. One of the possible modalities was the emergence of a number of small towns in long-settled, basically rural regions, which in the years before they began to grow, expanded their non- agricultural economic activities and acquired the social and institu- tional complexity of genuinely urban communities. This is similar to what occurred in medieval Europe or the eastern coast of New England. O'Loughlin argues that historically, Ghanaian people have long been townspeople. Ten years later, a case study on the Gold-Coast in the 17th century took the same path (Kea, 1982). The argument be- comes yet more convincing during colonial times; in opposition to the concept of a static African "traditional man," recently Cooper demon- strated that colonizers themselves knew rurality had ended in Mombasa as early as the 1930s (1987). Another possible route to town formation is through territorial expansion rather than the continuing development of long-settled rural regions; many cities located in an expanding frontier sprang not from farming communities but from forts, trading posts, and lo- cated even within wilderness itself: at railroad junctions, at sites arbitrarily selected as the seats of administrative power, and at seemingly random points purchased and promoted by speculators who hoped to make their fortunes out of frontier development (Blumin, 1983: 54-56). Blumin's understanding of the genesis of cer- tain Western cities may be transposed nearly word for word to the case of a number of African towns, possibly in precolonial Yorubaland and, certainly, in southern Africa and elsewhere at the eve of colonization proper, when the frontier problem was obviously ascendant. The fact is that historians of Europe as well as anthropologists in Africa have overstated the opposition between a preindustrial city supposedly based on political, religious, and military incentives (Duby, 1980) and a modern city, based on production, and hence on the economy (Berry, 1973). No citations are made here on the indus- trial metropolis as there are so many in the Western scholarly historical literature on the topic. It suffices to say that this trend led specialists of Africa to consciously or unconsciously conflate modern- ization with westernization (or industrialization) and therefore often to confuse historical modernization and colonization. Urbanization and westernization were, in the mind of the specialists, inextricably intertwined as regards their practical social implications in Africa as aspects of a single process of change. As Krapf-Askari notes (1969: 11-13), the very title of the first formal attempt to pool existing knowl- edge on the topic was revealing: Industrialization and Urbanization in Africa South of the Sahara (Forde, 1956). Even Georges Balandier, who later wrote several brilliant chapters on precolonial Kongo towns 9</page><page sequence="10">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW (1965), and who criticized Anglo-Saxon anthropologists for their over- simplified model of culture contact which took no account of a specific "colonial situation," wrote of the Congolese as "peoples who had no urban tradition" (1985). Therefore African colonial cities, themselves products of the colonial situation, were a useful labora- tory in which to study social change (once more identified with modernization). Thus one understands why before the colonial city, no true city existed in Africa (compare Whitty, 1972, apropos Zimbabwe and Inyanga ruins); this concept of a true city is often em- ployed by Africanists without clarification as to which model (American? Londonese? Latin?) they refer. Always, they refer to the one which seems the more normal, and thus the most convenient to the observer's environment, leading to an eminently subjective judgement. Both Western historians and Africanist social anthropologists stressed a traditional opposition between, on the one hand, the an- cient or medieval city, which would be mainly a religious and political center relying upon its military force, and, on the other hand, the economic city emerging in a merchant form at the dawn of modernity, linked to the setting of capitalism and subject to giving birth to industrial metropoles later on (Mumford, 1961: 410-411). The ancient city would be characterized by the juxtaposed presence of great powers, located one close to the other, and inscribed in monu- mental architecture: politically with the palace, religiously with the temple, the mosque, or the church, and militarily with the encampment (Duby, 1980: 1-35). Starting from this basic hypothesis, a whole series of other classifications was offered: regal-ritual, ad- ministrative, or mercantile (Fox, 1977: 32-38), or else court towns and commerce towns (Hannerz, 1980: 76-91). In other words, while the de- tails differ, an ideological predisposition with the accent on the economic and commercial aspects was emphasized, involving a pro- gressive movement away "from a situation in which religion and administration (perhaps successively) played central roles to a situation in which commerce became the key element" (Winters, 1983). This plan was largely followed in a more static socio- anthropological form in the depiction of precolonial African towns. The main feature would be ritual and cosmological origin, evident in the spatial organization of the town, symbolic reflection of a ruling religious thought over its destiny. In fact such hypotheses were better demonstrated in villages-Dogon, Sao of Tchad (Lebeuf, 1962: 75-87)- than in cities. One of the rare examples of cities subjected to such analysis was Musumba, capital of the Lunda Empire, whose very conception and the resulting layout could be an anthropomorphic representation linked (nobody really knows why) to that symbolic animal, the tortoise (Margarido, 1970). A traditional city would be a religious and political center, the seat of the ruling family who would regroup a privileged and pro- 10</page><page sequence="11">The Process of Urbanization in Africa tected clientele. Two examples of this analysis can be given. The first one concerns the formation of lacustrine kingdoms of which the aristocracy were cattle herders, formerly migrating people from the northern part of the country who monopolized power in order to dom- inate the preexisting agricultural people, Hima shepherds in the Chwezi kingdom at the border of Rwanda and Northern Uganda; later, from the 16th thru 18th centuries, Tutsi of Rwanda and Burundi conquering Hutu peasants; sociopolitical formations of Ankole from Buganda. The capital city tended to be coincidental with the royal camp and palace, always located in its center; the urban character remained mobile, as every new sovereign had to build a new palace, thus a new capital city, on a new hill. The atmosphere was still that of a camp more than that of a city (Mwohora, 1977: 116-125). Another late example comes from Foumbam, capital of the Bamum (Cameroon), at the end of 19th century. Its settlement and or- ganization were organized in concentric lineage circles (the nearest palace designating the closest parentele to the sovereign) and were organized to strengthen the royal power and enhance the representa- tion of his kinship. In short, the city map, which was conceptualized in the image of that of the palace, relegated the social elements which were least integrated to the hierarchy of power to the periphery; it was a mirror of the hierarchical kin organization of the whole society, as much the rural as the urban. The condition for royal power was the maintenance as such of the so defined strata. Food supply of the city resulted from the same kin organization, each household resting on the dependents and slaves of its rural domains. This type of political and lineage vision of society is to be found elsewhere (for example, in the literature on Yoruba urbanization, such as Bascom, 1955 and 1959). It tends to obliterate or marginalize the key problem of city food supply, even if some authors are discon- certed by this ruling ideology. In the case of three old capital cities of central Africa-Sao Salvador, the capital of the old Kingdom of the Kongo; Musumba, capital of the Lunda Empire; and Zimbabwe, capital of a medieval unnamed Shona State-Randles asked whether they can really be called towns. He thinks they can, but, as with other scholars at that time, he felt this was "more because they were centres of political control rather than economic centres of specializa- tion and of division of labour" (1972, 895). He is not altogether confident of this view, though, because of the four main criteria which he identifies as defining a town, three are socioeconomic: size, monumental architecture and layout of the capitals, the manner by which the inhabitants were supplied with food, and association of the capital with craft specialization. The lineage argument has been used until now to deny Yoruba cities their character of true cities. In comparison with the British model he obviously had in mind, Lloyd argued that although Yoruba towns were large and densely populated, they were but settlements of agricultural people (1973: 107-123); according to the 1952 census, over 11</page><page sequence="12">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW 70 percent of the adult Yoruba men were still farmers. This proportion of town-dwelling farmers could not be repeated for each of the large western Nigerian towns: there is no urban-rural dichotomy, and ur- banism as a way of life could not be differentiated from folk or rural life. Social structure was still based on kinship, descent, and age groups, lacking heterogeneity both in an ethnic and religious sense as well as in the degree of economic specialization. He concludes: "Thus the contemporary Yoruba town, in spite of its modern-looking houses, new shops, gas stations, and public buildings, is still far from pos- sessing those features usually attributed to the urban area"4 (p. 120); it constitutes "an anomalous correlate with town settlement" (p. 118). As a matter of fact, we have here to think of the irony in Giddens' argu- ment that it is in capitalism that the "urban" loses its specific meaning (1981: 147-149): perhaps it is easier to label a Yoruba city as urban than to label any city of today in the US (except Manhattan). The preindustrial city was also said to be a noneconomic center because it was nonproductive. It was contrasted with the industrial city which was supposed to be the productive center of a country. Max Weber was the first to comment on this idea: The ruler's city was a city populated with consumers (1921). Its inhabitants depended eco- nomically upon large, parasitic aristocratic households whose members lived off their rents; the city was the negation of an economic locus. This idea was recently and strongly expressed with regard to Western European preindustrial cities, for example 18th- century Paris and London (Daunton, 1978). Based on rural/urban dualism, the thesis was again developed by some Africanists, who opposed the parasitic city of folk societies to the generative one of in- dustrial societies. Because their impact on economic growth was favorable, colonial capitals were put half way between the two, as they represented "a culturally generative but economically parasitic process of urbanization" (Hoselitz, 1954: 281), since colonial cities were parasites on the rural producers, competing with rural settlers in the process of surplus extraction (Ross and Telkamp, 1985: 1). Certainly, those cities in which aristocratic and military families reside can be perceived as usually economically passive centers for parasitic social groups, who were fed and maintained from abroad (from their farms or military expeditions). The town would thus only be constituted by unproductive people---officials, mili- tary officers, brokers, landlords-who confiscated for their own sake what was produced by the labor of others-slaves, farmers, taxpayers. No matter how unproductive they were, these privileged aristocrats also exerted a dynamic force. Not only did they encourage a circulation of commodity goods, but they also needed and gathered around them a great number of active people of all kinds, necessary to take care of them, to feed and to protect them, to produce, to carry and to organize everything they needed-foodstuffs, utensils, slaves and servants, merchants and craftsmen, moneylenders, house-hold- ers, canvassers, bricklayers. In turn, all these people activated urban 12</page><page sequence="13">The Process of Urbanization in Africa networks and marketplaces. The ruling class propelled the economy, thanks to its strategical impulse, and it would be unrealistic not to take this into account. Therefore, where should we locate the division between the preindustrial and the modern city? Gordon Childe, again, proposed to profit from the advantage of the English language (only one word for city exists in French: la ville), and "call such settlements, more com- plex than villages yet not deserving the title of 'city' 'towns.'" Town would mean all transitional forms whose slow and long evolution had lasted for many centuries before they had matured to the point of becoming a city (Childe, 1957: 36); only "City" would conform to the ten criteria defined above. Georges Duby insists upon the eventually political character of the preindustrial city; he tends to oppose the an- cient cite to the medieval ville which emerged between the 11th and the 13th centuries, and which was "more characterized by mer- chants and craftsmen," a center of production and exchange born from the emerging economical growth of Western Europe (Duby, 1980). Sjoberg proposes a similar idea; he distinguishes the preindus- trial city from the economic city of today by referring to another later transformation-advances in technology (referring to the sources of energy, the tools and the know-how connected with the use of both tools and sources of energy for the production of goods and services)- which became the key independant variable, therefore the main criterion of differentiation. The use of living sources of energy from men and animals would characterize the one in opposition to the other, industrialism being based on inanimate energy (steam, elec- tricity, nuclear energy). In fact, he amalgamates into a single concept many preindustrial variants, since two thousands year or so of ur- ban history are suggested to have been essentially static. Nevertheless, Sjoberg's proposal is coherent. It allows us to minimize the artificial dichotomy of political versus economic, since economics, in the form of technology, is no longer rejected for ancient cities. A New Reconciliation by Recent Syntheses? A problem has been stressed recently: Is the age, location, or cultural background necessarily connected to economics? Bairoch supplies a useful exposition of the recent progress in the analysis of the links between towns and economics through the different phases of urban history and different societies (1985). Following Mumford's argument (1961), he emphasizes that urbanization was made possible with the emergence of the Neolithic era, that is to say, with the be- ginning of agriculture; ever since he has spoken of "preurban cities" or "proto-urbanization" (p. 30). Agriculture permitted on the one hand an exchangeable food surplus and, on the other, an increase of popu- lation density, though we are unable to determine which phenomenon was decisive. In short, it was not writing but agriculture that was the index of civilization and the determinant of urban revolution. As for the town, if it did not invent agriculture right 13</page><page sequence="14">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW from the beginning, it was nevertheless an efficient engine for agri- cultural progress. Eventually, as in sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture was "basically noncentric" (Harlan, De Wet, and Stemler, 1976) and the steps of city invention were unequally distributed through time. A second widely accepted proposition is that if the urban process is a universal one, a definition for it has to be general enough to em- brace the entire phenomenon (Braudel, 1973). If we except Southall's Urban Anthropology (1973), which was a juxtaposition of case studies rather than a comparison, only recently have comparative studies emerged. One of the first was that of Basham on Cross-Cultural Urban Anthropology (1978). Studies comparing African cities to other cities in the world, both in precolonial times and today (cities in the Third World), and preferably in the long term (from origins to the present), are more numerous now, sometimes openly dismissing or daring to question Max Weber's heritage (for example Bairoch, 1985; or Rossi, 1987). Rossi's work is particularly significant. It starts explicitly from the Weberian postulate concerning Western town specificity, its autonomous political locus and seat of power linked to the modern state formation. Comparative study enables us to challenge this assertion on at least two points. The first is that we cannot consider "the Western town" as a unitary and necessary type, but more as a plurality of diversified patterns, articulated on varied historical contexts, from the antique city to the industrial metropolis, passing through the me- dieval town and the mercantile capitalist one. The second is that urban specificity in the Western world is not exceptional; gradually as we study the urban phenomenon in other societies, we increasingly discover, everywhere in the world, in Asia, Latin America, or in sub-Saharan Africa, either structural or functional analogies and correspondences. Everywhere, the town can be defined by a state structure of which it is a part or that it constitutes itself, by a given configuration of relationships between the political organiza- tion and the social stratification, through a set of reciprocal links between adjacent towns, between the town and its surrounding terri- tory. The construction of a coherent urban model, at a universal level, must refer to this multiplicity of historical situations and extracts through this diversity what makes the irreductible unity, beyond the multiple variants stemming from differentiations in time and space (Rossi, 1987: 18-21). For sub-Saharan Africa, the Nigerian geographer Akin Mabogunje (1968) has most convincingly theorized the model. Like Bairoch, he states that "cities are essentially the points of articulation of an economic system." Ideally, therefore, every economic system should generate its own "appropriate system of cities" (Mabogunje, 1968: 22). Although his work is relatively old, nothing better has been done since. With the aid of examples from Hausa and Yoruba, he de- fines what were, in Africa as elsewhere, the limiting conditions for 14</page><page sequence="15">The Process of Urbanization in Africa the rise of urban centers. Three of them, at least, must be met (chap. 2: "The Theory of Urbanization"): -There must be a surplus of food production with which to feed the class of specialists whose activities are withdrawn from agriculture. -For this surplus to be made available to the group of specialists, there must be a small group of people who are able to exercise some power over the group of food producers. This power class also has to ensure stable and peaceful conditions in which both the food producers and the specialists can pro- duce their best. -In order to facilitate the work of the specialists and to satisfy their needs for raw materials, there must be a class of traders and merchants. The availability of food surplus presupposed a relationship between urbanization and agriculture; it required both the fertility of the soil and an available technology for exploiting this fertility. This postulated the existence of a power group able to preside over the allo- cation of resources, crucial to the process of urbanization. Among the methods used by this ruling class, the role of the priestly class or the divine representative was important, as was the ability to organize the males of the community into an army. The city which could develop an important army liquidated such an institution in neigh- boring cities and created a nation or an empire. More essentially, the power class was prevalent in urbanization in so far as it determined the extent of functional specialization in the community: crafstmen, priests, traders. It especially needed a class of merchants who had to travel far and wide and to organize networks of trade; at least in the beginning of the 19th century, the main town dominated a secondary network constituted of many small centers, rather regularly spaced (from 20 to 60 km). As precise descriptions given by travelers of the time testify (Clapperton; Barth), this density was indeed well adapted to the means of transportation for that period. Transport requirements could not exceed this distance. For a town to fulfil its function of "suburb-market" in the surrounding economic context, characterized as it was by limited production and a low per capita income, its transport system capacities prevented further extension of the city limits (Mabogunje, 1968: 69-71). This began the process of ethnic heterogeneity "which is so characteristic a feature of cities today" (p. 40). When the power of the town had largely subjugated the surrounding region, it became a metropolis (a political, religious one) whose control extended quite far, as was the case, for example, with Old Oyo (Katunga) in its time of glory when it dominated four provinces, each one administered in turn by a main center. The 15</page><page sequence="16">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW province where Oyo was located thus owned its own regional capital city (Ikoyo), itself commanding a network of small secondary cen- ters (Kishi, Igboho, Irawo, Iwere, Igbomosho) (Mabogunje, 1968: 78). Mabogunje pays little attention to any functional theory of urbanization. Though he asserts that the specialization of functions among human communities through the division of labor is the essence of urbanization, specialization does not give rise by itself to urban centers; it takes place only under certain well-defined condi- tions (see above). For the rest, Mabogunje doubts the validity of isolat- ing indices of urbanization in order to distinguish between communities which are urbanized and those which are not; these indices may be criticized largely on the basis of their being ethnocentric (as for Childe's writing). From these different authors, we may confirm what was asserted in the introduction: A city, in Africa as elsewhere, reflects the global social and economic context. For each epoch, for each mode of production and exchange, for each type of power and ideology, there exist corresponding models of urban settlements and urbanism. Of course, the correspondence between modes of production and ex- change, on the one hand, and patterns of power and ideology, on the other, and therefore with modes of urbanization, is not one to one; capitalist development since precolonial times and the quest for hegemony by colonial and post-colonial regimes intersect in differing and contradictory ways. Nevertheless, obviously, within a subsis- tence economy, towns are fewer and less differentiated than in a developed industrialized society. Third World metropoles are not sim- ilar to Western capitalist cities. But in each case we are dealing with real cities (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988a). Which Definition for African Urbanization? The concept has to be large enough to cover the universality of the process. The literature offers various possible definitions of the African process which vary according to the disciplines: -Geographers and city-planners have proposed a spatial one: Urbanization is "the process whereby human beings congre- gate in relatively large number at one particular spot of the earth's surface" (Mabogunje 1968: 33). This definition, he says, is deliberately vague, as the process differs considerably de- pending on what period of time and what part of the world we consider. -Social scientists are rather disturbed by this kind of definition. Political scientists would rather stick to Weber's old definition of a power phenomenon coming from a city as a center of dominance (Miner, 1967: 4-5). But for most anthropol- ogists and sociologists, urbanization is a mere social process of both cultural concentration and diffusion: Cities "act as cul- 16</page><page sequence="17">The Process of Urbanization in Africa tural transmitters, for the mark of a truly great metropolitan center is its ability to radiate its institutions" (Hull, 1976a: xiii). The cultural dimension of urbanization has been de- fined and defined again in Africa by urban anthropologists since the beginning of the 1960s; one may find a reasonably comprehensive summary of the successive proposals in Krapf- Askari (1969: 9-37). Why have the two definitions so seldom been connected, at least practically, since they appear to be complementary? Louis Wirth's often repeated definition is quite clear. Thirty years ago he wrote what some of his successors have tried painfully to express anew: "A city may be defined as a relatively large, dense, and permanent set- tlement of socially heterogeneous individuals" (Wirth, 1938 and 1964). Like space and density for Mabogunje, the concept of social heterogene- ity is vague enough to accord with varied realities (ethnical, profes- sional, economical, religious, cultural). Since then, the definition has been completed by the idea of accessibility (Morton-Williams, 1972: 885), which is, in the case of Western Africa, the spatial variant of Wirth's social concept of heterogeneity: The criterion of a truly urban society must, then, be accessibility . That implies for the archaeologist that evidence of a market- place within a settlement is a better indication for an urban com- munity, with the necessary centralized government, than the existence of cult centres which may indicate only . . . a closed community. If there is a market place, that is evidence for enough instituted authority to keep peace and to [protect] markets and roads. A last characteristic for cities is significant in Africa: Cities in the past as in the present have been tools for colonization. Surprisingly enough, only one author dared to construct a theory out of this statement. McGee suggests that towns which grew as links in the interaction of two civilizations were flourishing even in the preindustrial society, for example, as a result of the contact of the Roman Empire and the North African cultures (1964: 171). He did not go so far as to propose this power of cultural colonization for all cities; he distinguishes a discrete class of urban phenomenon, half-way be- tween the preindustrial and the industrial city. This classification was resumed by Horvath (1969: 72). Nevertheless, McGee is one of the very few who generalize the concept of a colonial city in the long- run. Rayfield (1974) went a little further. He clearly states, using the example of West African cities, that we may distinguish three stages, each of which deals with colonial cities, connected to the concept of domination: first, the cities of the Western Sudan founded in about the 9th century in connection with trans-Saharan trade; second, the Guinea Coast cities in connection with the transatlantic slave trade; and third, the modern colonial city proper. All were colonial, not only 17</page><page sequence="18">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW because of long-distance trade but also because of a dominant conquer- ing ideology (Islam, then Christianity and mercantilism, then technology and imperialism), in each case subordinating the African city to its relationship with the world economy and foreign political powers, involving at last the substitution of native elites for colonial rulers. He concludes that: "the urbanization process is universal, and that the West African colonial city represents only the most recent, most rapid, and most conspicuous example of it" (1974: 183). Some au- thors have adapted the idea, particularly in the case of Yoruba cities (Fage, 1978), following Mabogunje, who states: Yoruba towns arose largely as a form of 'colonial settlement' among indigenous, more backward and perhaps hostile peoples, [with] a conscious attempt to dominate and control the unorga- nized mass of aborigines found in the region (1968: 76). If we refer to the cultural role of diffusion of a city as described by Hull, these authors implicitly mean that all towns may be consid- ered tools of colonization; but no author actually dared to assert it as explicitly as A.E. Smailes: It is hardly an exaggeration to regard the town as the normal set- tlement form of imperial expansion and intrusion of civilized people into territories already occupied by societies engaged in practising a less advanced economy. The incomers find security in concentration and collect in towns for their mutual protection. Their urban character further expresses their role as administra- tors, traders or military pensioners (1975: 75). The historiography and comparison of these conceptions is highly instructive in the evolution of African studies and does not necessar- ily correspond with ideological positions (Marxist versus non- Marxist, for example). It may be noted too that, from the 1960s through the early 1970s, anglophone literature has tended to focus on urban anthropology and social change while francophone literature has emphasized space and urban planning. Monique Lakroum's forth- coming quantitative analysis of the bibliography on African urbanization for the last fifteen years reveals these differences: an- other language, another perception of urbanization. In the French literature a city is considered a place, defined by its location, its situ- ation, and identified by its forms (urban morphology). Particular attention is given to relations between demographic trends, urban space and the built environment, but little attention is paid to social process; this point emerges only today, with respect to urban life since the 1970s and 1980s. A city is rather seen from outside, and a priori. The study is more descriptive and chronological than historical: birth, life, growth, and death of cities. French geographers, in particular, have examined both urban settlements and processes of change of regional networks involving a 18</page><page sequence="19">The Process of Urbanization in Africa hierarchy of cities. With the exception of Hance's survey (1970) which deals both with demography and geography, there were few comparable treatments of African cities in English. To be sure, in the case of Kenya, Taylor (1974) had already emphazised the role of the smaller urban places to incorporate rural areas more effectively in the processes of modernization and McNulty (1966) had also investi- gated urban centers and the spatial pattern of development in Ghana. Recent empirical studies (Western, 1982; King, 1984), though, are closer to French scholarship. It is now more common to analyze the hierarchical networks of small and intermediate urban centers and their role for regional and national developement (Hardoy and Sutterthwaite, 1986). Akin Mabogunje proposes a "systems approach" which views migration to the city in terms of systems theory (town and village being part of the same system). Recently Nolan (1979) called it an "integrated approach" (Mabogunje, 1970). Francophone scholars speak of "rurbanization." Usually in anglophone literature urban space is especially social space, where ethnic and political questions predominate. Anglophone urban anthropology, so attentive to human social behav- ior or feelings, has paid little attention to people's physical surroundings: their houses, offices, or factories. Only recently has housing become quite prominent, as far as slums are considered. Analyses focus on social groups: classes, associations, communities. Urban morphology is only considered when it deals with exclusion, segregation; a city is above all a locus of sociability; location and housing are considered but only when they interfere with social ac- tors. This approach, where sociological and ethnographic features prevail, insists upon the qualitative aspects of growth. It appears desirable to build a bridge between the two approaches and to combine their methods in order to grasp both the content and the container. On the one hand we must ask if it is not the destruc- tion of the old urban forms (sometimes including even the ones in- herited from colonization) by contemporary urban social and political phenomena which is a characteristic of African cities and, on the other hand, if these latter can in their turn engender the creation of alternate, already perceivable forms (Lakroum, 1989). After all, we can claim for the African city (as for others) Braudel's (1973) twofold definition of the civilization concept: altogether space, society, econ- omy and collective mentality. Periodization Most studies are indeed periodized. Therefore, it is useful to construct a comprehensive survey of our present historical knowl- edge of African cities. Many of the studies (most often, case studies) are, or rather were, more descriptive and factual than theoretical and synthetic, especially in the case of precolonial cities, offering as many snapshots of varied periods and spaces. From the existing liter- 19</page><page sequence="20">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW ature, each period might almost be characterized by its typology of cities based on privileged sources: archeology on ancient cities, Arabic sources (and archeology) on Islamized mediaeval cities, European (foreign) sources on slave-trade centers, and others. The result of this method has been a classification of African cities by their historical origin, or their apparent major feature at a given moment of their history, as in the work of Anthony O'Connor, a geographer who pro- poses six models of cities: the native city; the Islamic city; the colonial (administrative) city; the European (color-bar) city; the dual city (such as Khartoum/Omdurman); the hybrid city, being a mixture of two of the previous ones (1983). The value of such a descriptive ty- pology is questionable; all African cities are today hybrid ones, but they are not all the same. Disputable as a typology, this categorization may be useful as a chronology, as Christopher Winters demonstrated in a learned and astute analysis (1983). Of course such a survey necessarily reduces and simplifies: first of all, because a periodization involves long transitional phases of interconnection between the different ideal types, and second, because the purpose of such a survey is, through their succession, to analyze the cumulative influences which accu- mulated in every single city from the beginning to today. Nevertheless it helps us to understand the major historical stages of African urbanization. Periodization stereotypes an urbaniza- tion for each period and each cultural area. Old cities in Africa were not similar to the industrial metropoles of 19th-century Europe, be- cause they were precapitalist (which is a clearer concept than "traditional city," used by Hull, 1976). If we have to compare them, they would conform rather with European medieval towns, since most of them were neither large nor heavily populated, seldom exceeding a few thousand inhabitants. Even in the case of major trading cities, such as ports of the Sahelian fringe, or the centers of long-distance trade networks in the grasslands or the slave-trade harbors, there were, as late as the 19th century, only small-sized set- tlements where the major part of the population went on cultivating, and whose urbanism scarcely differed from that of the rural settlements. For this reason and also because of the often fragile na- ture of building materials, such settlements frequently had the appearance of a green city closer to that of the village. The same may be assumed for the ancient stone-built cities of southern Africa where cattle herders reproduced the model of the kraal, except for some rather unusual places of monumental architecture around which the rest of the city was built (thus proving the existence of an urbanism). Such a typology lacks a clear connection between the proposed succession of models of cities and the corresponding global social and economic process and does not escape the risk of resembling a succes- sion of snapshots. Since the succession of these many case studies and comparisons suggest underlying different successive influences (proto-Bantu, Islam, Portuguese), we arrive at a sharp distinction. The 20</page><page sequence="21">The Process of Urbanization in Africa main difference lies between the precapitalist and the capitalist situation; the gap was not between the colonial and postcolonial city on one side, and precolonial on the other. Through the longue durde, one may rather perceive two separate large waves of the urbanization process interrupted by a pause, with the 19th century representing a decisive turning point between the two. Not surprisingly, a new African urban revolution (by reference to the Neolithic one) was co- eval to the emergence of industrial capitalism in Europe. Within both groups (or waves) of African cities, mainly influenced by their pre- capitalist or capitalist environment, the chronology and location of cities suggest a more precise typology, which is not easy to name/label. Words are traps-for example, when we speak of Islamic cities, this denomination exaggerates and oversimplifies urban realities, which were in Western Sudan during the medieval era made of much more than Islam alone. We prefer to speak here of Islamized cities, though Islamization was, of course, only partial. Still more difficult is to define a correct concept for those towns which were in- fluenced later than others by Islam or by direct contact with the Europeans; most of these were located far in the hinterland, in central Africa, and we might call them "central African cities;" but the phrase suggests a static, ahistorical relationship to their geograph- ical environment. We prefer "old Bantu cities," which points rather to cultural factors, although it does it in an exaggerated fashion. Of course all African cities inherited more or less a common cultural background, and Bantu cities also were pluricultural. (Unfortunately, for the moment, there seems to be no better word!) Precapitalist Cities A first generation of cities appears everywhere in Africa. Though with a variety of forms according to time and place, it com- prehensively includes an initial major urban wave apprehended by two historical studies: Davidson's (1970) and Hull's (1976). They were recently and rightly amended by Winters (1983); Davidson, who intended to rehabilitate the reality of old African cities, ignored at the time, had an inspired but rather idealized view about the vanished grandeur of "Azanian cities," exaggerating how large, impressive and numerous they were. Several of Davidson's views were corrected by later archeological investigations. Hull had a rather romantic tendency to accentuate the bucolic character of old African urban so- cieties, close to their rural environment which protected people from the evils of contemporary modernization and industrialization, in short, capitalism (Winters, 1983). New research tends to prove that precapitalist African urbanization did not need to be exaggerated or minimized, because its relatively restricted development fitted well with the demographic conditions and modes of production and long- distance economic relations of mostly rural and trading societies. 21</page><page sequence="22">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW Another recent theory questions the previously supposed necessary interrelationship between international long-distance trade (through the Sahara or the Indian Ocean) and the progress of urbanization in Africa. Most research now emphasizes an indige- nous process of urbanization from the beginning, attributable to previous regional or even local networks into which the long-dis- tance trade had to insert itself (especially the trade with the Arab Mediterranean world, but also, further south, with the Atlantic trade). The evidence for this looks more convincing for western Africa than for the eastern coast. Ancient Cities In Africa as elsewhere, pristine settlements occurred jointly with the emergence of agriculture. Rather strikingly, the renewal of urban studies in Africa is now being promoted brilliantly by archeol- ogists who: 1) have asserted vigorously that urbanization emerged early in Africa, thus agreeing with the concept of universality; 2) have explicitly employed a cross-disciplinary methodology to rein- force their archeological investigations (using, for example, oral sources, written testimonies, historical anthropology, but also ecologi- cal observations and economics); 3) are therefore ready to reconsider some widely accepted ideas, such as the prevalence of long-distance trade or the influence of Islam in promoting African urbanization; 4) increasingly assert the prevalence of an autochtonous longue-durge process of urbanization based on regional internal purposes as much as international outward-oriented ones; and 5) question the relation- ship between urbanization and the state, underlining the prevalence of the city over the state, whereas prior studies (Forde, Falola, Crowder) conflated both concepts (state and city), suggesting that to study the state was also to study the city, which consequently was not directly considered-the matter was all the more confusing as both were usually given the same name. Two recent and original publications have added forceful emphasis to these views: McIntosh on Jenne-Jeno (1986) and Connah on Archaeological Perspectives on Precolonial Cities and States (1987), both of these by archeologists who prove to be exceptionally open to possible alternative documentary sources, such as oral traditions and later archive materials written in Arabic. Their perceptions receive additional support from shorter archeological investigations, the most striking one being on what seems to be the oldest ruins in western Africa, Dar Tichitt (3800 to 2300 B.P.), probably a stalled early form of proto-urban settlement occuring at the time of the Neolithic Revolution on the southern Sahara border, and later abandoned because of the progressive desertification of the area (Munson, 1972). Other research may be quoted on Niani, capital of ancient Mali, whose first remains date back as early as the 6th century (Filiopowiak, 1979); also that of Thilmans and Rovis6 (1980) on upper Senegal; Shinnie and Ozanne (1962); Posnansky (1973); Sutton (1987) on (modern) Ghana; and C.T. 22</page><page sequence="23">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Shaw (1983) on the southern site of Igbo-Ukwu (Nigeria) which dates from the 9th century. Such dates were previously considered too early; this new evidence makes them now plausible, thus proving that Igbo-Ukwu developed long before contact with distant foreign in- fluences. As for Jenne-Jeno on the Niger river, it began to grow around 250 B.C., peaked as a city between the 4th and the 9th centuries A.D. (when it perhaps expanded over 40 hectares), but was condemned by the progress of Islam and the emergence of the new Muslim city of Jenne (12th century). This discovery is fascinating; it proves that in Africa urbanization predated Islamization, therefore predating as well the expansion of a monotheist religion. It was made possible by a favorable situation in the core of an agriculturally fertile area between complementary ecological environments and on the edge of a major waterway from west to east, the river Niger. It may also ex- plain why Muslim penetration and trans-Saharan long-distance trade were so easily and rapidly accepted: The ground had been prepared by a long indigenous urban tradition. A similar evolution probably unfolded in eastern Africa. Of course, an urban culture proceeded along the Nile, from Egypt to Meroe (see Shinnie, 1967, 1977; Hassan, 1971; Amborn, 1970; Shinnie and Kense, 1977). On the coast, it was related to a Persian influence through the Persian Gulf and also to the Roman Empire's expansion at the beginning of our era (Mathew, 1975), although we still do not know the precise location of the only important Roman emporium along the Kenya coast (Chittick, 1970). According to previous authors, African populations of the hinterland did not appear to have played any part in coastal urbanization open to navigation with the Arabic peninsula before Islam, while several of the island cities existed be- fore Swahili culture (Chittick, 1970; Chittick and Rotberg, 1975). But Connah recently insisted on an indigenous local, African origin of urbanization on the East African Coast, arguing that from the begin- ning cities and villages were closely interrelated, which is plausible (see below, on later Swahili culture), even if it sounds more like a hypothesis than evidence. Old Bantu Cities Stone-built Cities and the Question of Zimbabwe Stone-built ruins are numerous and widely spread in eastern and southern Africa. But they are no longer seen as signifiers of an urban civilization; Engaruka in northern Tanzania (Sassoon, 1967; Sutton, 1971), or even Inyanga in the northeast of Zimbabwe (Whitty, 1972) may have rather been the result of extensively shifting agricul- ture by isolated populations. But Zimbabwe undoubtedly testifies to an urban Shona civilization which left many other ruins, even if less elaborate. It was not a Shona centralized empire (Beach's 1980 theory probably having to be put aside), but rather a culture based both on a 23</page><page sequence="24">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW subsistence economy of seminomadic cattle herders and the limited but effective power of an aristocracy which controlled a regional (later international) gold trade, exploited via a traditional technology, possibly with the help of slaves (Garlake, 1982). Rozvi urban culture, inherited from Zimbabwe, diffused westward (Dhlo-Dhlo and Khami ruins, near Bulawayo, probably dating from the 16th to the 18th cen- tury [Robinson, 1959]) and southward (the Mapungubwe burial site) and, above all, north of the Rand in South Africa, impressive ruins of Kurrichane town, in the core of a probably urbanized area which was raided by the Mfecane at the beginning of the 19th century (Summers, 1971). One may actually speculate about the existence of a previous urban culture here-or at least of a proto-urban one-which was destroyed by the twofold assault of external forces (slave-trade wars, an outcome of Portuguese intrusions) and internal struggles (military setbacks resulting from the wars of the Mfecane). The failure of this former urbanization gave way to a period of transition serving as a prologue to an emerging dependence on imported capitalism. Indirectly or directly, Western capitalism imposed a new military and political order which ultimately destroyed the ancient urban cul- ture in the second half of the 19th century. Sleeping sickness spread and also accelerated the dispersion of nuclei of weakened populations which were, not long ago, probably denser and better organized. Therefore, the theory proposed by Basil Davidson of an earlier more urbanized culture (or at least not exclusively rural one) still seems valid. Bantu Capital Cities of Lacustrine Kingdoms and of Political Entities in the Congo Basin Bantu central Africa probably was the least urbanized area on the continent. From subsistence societies, neither large and central- ized empires nor intricate urban networks evolved. Nevertheless, some capital cities existed here from the middle of the 13th century, although the evidence is weak-most historical material comes from the Portuguese period or even only from the 19th century. A process similar to that which occurred on the fringe of Western Sahara some ten centuries or so earlier is plausible, resulting from the encounter between cattle herders and indigenous cultivators. The herders orga- nized capital cities as centers of their dominating power. This was the case for small kingdoms such as Rwanda (capital Nyanza, Lugan, 1975; Mworoha, 1977) or Ankole (Oliver, 1959), for Musumba, capital city of the Lunda Empire (Randles, 1972; Margarido, 1970), or even for Mbanza-Congo, capital of the old Kongo kingdom (Randles, 1968; Balandier, 1965). These wandering towns existed in central Africa as late as the eve of the colonial era; such were the Bakuba capitals (Vansina, 1978), and above all the Kibuga, capital city of the Ganda kingdom, on which Gutkind's pioneering study (1963) remains an excellent model. 24</page><page sequence="25">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Ethiopian Towns Ethiopian towns have received special attention and thanks to the quality of research in this field, valuable hypotheses may be in- ferred for other cities on the continent. Old cities were necessarily migratory cities because of their military role as fortified castles, because of their political function requiring the physical presence of the king (in turn) in each of his provinces, and because of their nega- tive impact on an environment (soils and cultivators) unsuited to feed a dense population for a long period (Horvath, 1969; Pankhurst, 1961, 1965, 1982; Crummey, 1987). There is no reason why Ethiopian pre- colonial towns should be considered-as in earlier research-as alien, anomalous excrescences. They were the consequence of inherent realities of Ethiopian history, born from a rural production based on slavery and insuring the duration and stability of the whole system by their extractive relationship with their agrarian surround- ings. Limits to urbanization being closely connected to societal limits on surplus accumulation, cities could not but remain small, with an average population typically not exceeding 2000 to 4000 inhabitants (Crummey, 1987). All these arguments apply as much to Ethiopia as to the Kibuga, Shona, and Kongo cities. Islamized Cities They were cities born from or influenced by the long-distance connections with the Arab-Muslim world, more accessible to Western knowledge and culture, even if comprehensive studies on African medieval Muslim cities are not as developed as those of the Middle East. There are only a few archeological works, mainly articles, either on Western Sudan or on Swahili urban civilization (this has been better investigated recently), as well as a small number of monographs. Swahili Cities Only recently have some archeologists dared to go beyond the mere techniques of an excavation report to propose a methodology to unite archeological remains, archival materials, and oral traditions (Spear and Nurse, 1985). For the moment, we know more about house framing or the chronology of building techniques (Curle, 1937). The case of Kilwa is especially well studied (Chittick, 1974), while our knowledge of Mombasa is limited to its history under the Portuguese (Berg, 1968), and we know Lamu mainly by its architecture (Ghaidan, 1975). Social analyses remained very schematic. They presented in outline a three-level society: an Islamized aristocracy, a foreign trading class, and mainly pagan masses originating at least partly from the hinterland (Chittick and Rotberg, 1975). Only Lamu was investigated more fully-on slavery and marriage (Romero, 1983; 1984; 1986), crafts (Curtin, 1983), and religion (Zein, 1974), not to 25</page><page sequence="26">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW mention architecture. In spite of a consensus on the urban nature of Swahili culture, it was until very recently little studied as such. Once more, the present tendency is to stress African origins: Urban migrants known as Shirazi are no longer supposed to have come directly from Persia or the Persian Gulf, but rather to have spread southward from the Somali coast (Chittick, 1970; Allen, 1981; Allen and Wilson, 1982). Horton summarizes the convincing but weak archeological evidence for African indigenous influence (1987). His overview discounts the agency of colonists from Arabia and the dramatic distinctions between Muslim and pagan. Both could reside in stone-built, multistoried houses, located in merchant quarters of coastal towns. The low and perishable dwellings made of mud, pole, and thatch were occupied by the ordinary families and subordinate, fluctuating commercial people. Therefore the juxtaposition of stone town and shantytown did not simply result from the bipolar ideologi- cal statements that abound in the previous literature between Swahili-Arab on one side, and African elements on the other. It was more social than cultural. Recently linguists associated with archeologists have supported this view, insisting on the limited degree of Arabic inflences upon the Swahili language and emphasizing its close genetic relationships with other coastal languages (Nurse and Spear, 1985). Pouwels' basic socioeconomic model of early coastal communities as ethnically mixed and economically specialized, bound to each other by Somali- like patron-client relations, is an intriguing though questionable ap- plication of 19th-century Somali ethnography to a period a thousand years earlier (1987). He is more convincing on the emergence and elaboration of the Shirazi mode of coastal civilization, specifying which influences flowed from abroad and which from within coastal societies. Intermarriages, through wives and concubines of mainland Africa, certainly helped with the fusion of African and Arab cultural influences. If Swahili culture had a dual dimension, it stemmed not from an Arab/native opposition, but from gender differ- ences; women participated in African-inspired rather than Arab derived cultural practices as they acquired their social identity because the Arab elite culture was a culture of men (Eastman, 1988). As early as the beginning of the 1960s, Garlake (1966) opened the way for this new approach, insisting, once more, on an au- tochthonous African tradition. His analysis fits with more recent results of population and migration history on the coast. He points out that the coastal architecture drew its initial impetus from abroad, but also that its later extent was mainly indigenous to the coast. The fountainhead of all the post-13th century Swahili architecture was Husuni Kubwa, a city which dominated the port of Kilwa (p. 114). It is related to a mixture of influences coming from the Near East and India. Found in widely differing areas of Islam, it is difficult to re- late these forms to any one specific area. They probably diffused from minor provincial models of the later medieval period rather than 26</page><page sequence="27">The Process of Urbanization in Africa from the earlier great monuments of the major cities, "whose scale, complex construction and elaborate finishes were little relevant to the much smaller settlements of the coast, with their much more limited material and human resources" (p. 113). Beneath the basic unity of the coastal architecture, several minor regional variants de- veloped later on-slowly, but steadily-without outside influence. The nonhomogeneity was largely due to the systematic exploitation of limited but easily available varieties of local building material by technically competent artisans working in a defined tradition of lo- cal craftsmanship; more generally, the adaption of dwelling design to the severest climate problems, outperforming the structures of present-day architects, has been stressed (Fitch and Branch, 1960) for precolonial so-called primitive architecture. The result for Swahili cities was refinement through simplicity. Christopher Winters, on the cases of both Eastern and Western Sudan, explains how Islamic elements were incorporated into the ci- ties centuries before the colonial era, even if the obvious inference between Muslim and Black African forms is difficult to analyze because a "Black African urban archetype" has never been described and probably is not to be isolated (Winters 1977: 501; 1982). Nevertheless, with Sudanese cities as well as Umm Durman, capital of the Mahdist Empire, he has tried to delineate why Middle Eastern Islamic cities and African ones are both similar and different. Islamic cities were built around the mosque (or the shrine of a saint, frequent in Sudan) and the market, because daily life was organized around religion and commerce (De Planhol, 1959: 1-41). But African cities, he says, were centered on the palace of a ruler (and the mar- ketplace), because they were organized around the power of the chief, which was at one and the same time political, religious, and economical. This had been true in Sudan for ancient cities of the Funj State (and first of all in Sinnar, the capital). It continued to be true centuries later at Umm Durman because of a similar redistributive economy and the presence of a religious ruler. Cities remained ephemeral, both because of the precarious presence of a saint (because of death or migration) and because they were associated with a technological system quite different from that in Middle Eastern cities, one based much less on mechanical devices (such as water supply, having neither water systems nor wells) and much more on the use of highly impermanent building materials (such as puddle mud, thatch, and matting). Nevertheless, these towns also had many of the morphological features found in other Muslim settlements, even if housing was organized in compounds rather than consisting in storied houses adjacent to each other. Street pat- terns were similarly irregular; some towns were divided into quarters according to the standard model of Muslim urbanism and were also mainly connected by trade routes: 27</page><page sequence="28">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW Umm Durman comformed to the Muslim city archetype, it was an administrative and commercial center, a city with an immense market, and one whose residential areas, while organized neatly enough in quarters, were, in detail, characterized by great disorder (Winters, 1977: 506). The Western Sudan Though Winters' proposals might or, rather, should be taken as a leading thread through precolonial urbanism, little has been theo- rized aside from archeology (Devisse, 1970; Thomassey and Mauny, 1951; Mauny, 1951 and 1952) and monographs prevail: Jenne (Monteil, 1922), Tombouctou (P6fontan, 1922; Miner, 1953; Cissoko, 1975). The role of the Muslim elite and Muslim thought is the main subject of enquiry (Cissoko, 1969; Saad, 1983). There is not yet a global urban survey as exists for other parts of the Muslim world (Grunebaum, 1961; Lapidus, 1967). There is one notable exception in a study compar- ing Hausa city-states with city-states in other cultures (Griffeth, 1984). The most original research deals with Muslim architecture (Prussin, 1967-1968; 1982; and especially 1986, a splendid synthesis on the topic) and Muslim urban history in francophone Africa (Winters, 1982). It should be noted here, on a more general level, that only a few (albeit excellent) studies exist on other precolonial architecture (Western Sudan military architecture, Bah, 1985; general precolonial architec- ture, Denyer, 1978). But, for the moment, no theoretical attempt actually exists. Cities during the Portuguese Era Recent research appear to be exceptionally promising concerning the 16th and 17th centuries. The interregional urban net- works have been clarified. On the Ghanaian case, Kea (1982) demonstrated that urbanization accelerated all through the 17th century, resulting from a process of land privatization in the country- side: both phenomenon were connected and long predated the climax of slave trading. But this older urban culture weakened and fragmented later when the Atlantic slave trade swept away everything else (18th and 19th centuries). Two major recent works (Kea, 1982; Thornton, 1982, the latter already announced by Balandier, 1965) have explored Dutch or Portuguese archival materi- als, which had been neglected up to now, and compared them with archeological or oral evidence. Such case studies tend to prove, once more, that an urban culture flourished, certainly in West Africa (where it has been studied) and probably even in East Africa (in spite of little effective research on this intermediate period) but was dis- turbed if not destroyed by the intrusion of Western mercantilism (based in Africa on slave trading). Of course one might argue that the slave trade accentuated certain forms of urbanism, that of state capitals and that of defensive settlements where people victimized by 28</page><page sequence="29">The Process of Urbanization in Africa raiders concentrated. This argument has been used to explain how Yoruban urbanization hastened all through the 19th century, due to unceasing internal wars favored by a desperate quest for new chan- nels of slave trading (Law, 1977; Oguntomisin and Falola, 1987). This new generation of cities were more directly subjected to the emer- gence of dependent capitalism, as early as the 18th century in western Africa, probably later in eastern Africa. Western Africa In western Africa northern networks diffusing southward- from the Inner Niger Delta, Jenne and the Dyula (Wilks, 1961)-and a coastal navigation diffusing into the hinterland came together, stimulated by Portuguese traders who were at that time too busy with gold and food markets to concern themselves with slave trading. An inner urban culture developed, including a series of tiny states or city-states which would later be absorbed by a new centralized but rural-based empire: Ashanti (Kea, 1982). We shall see below that ur- banization of the Yoruba went through a similar process. Let us note that, along this path, Benin-City history is still to be written, though previous studies remain useful (Ryder, 1969; Igbafe, 1979; Onokerhoraya, 1975). Eastern Africa In eastern Africa, except for Mombasa (Berg, 1968), Portuguese or Indian influence, which enormously increased from the 18th cen- tury, is only seen through a long-distance trade history (Alpers, 1975) or through a history of protest and resistance (Isaacmann, 1976). Urban phenomena are neglected. A rather old monograph on Zanzibar (Pearce, 1976) remains exceptional in this regard. There are no studies on Mozambique Island, a splendid site of Portuguese urban ar- chitecture of the early 17th century. Generally speaking, no history of the Portuguese model of diffusion exists to be compared to what has been done recently on Islam (Prussin, 1986). Why are there so few studies on urban history concerning this little known period just be- tween the end of Swahili towns and the emergence of just precolonial or colonial cities? The usual argument is to think of the Portuguese as mere killers of previous culture, skimming off tribute, only reinforcing some existing structures of exploitation, raiding and destroying much. In this conventional argument, one would not ex- pect them to bring a new model of the city. Nevertheless, the architectural jewel of Mozambique Island, similar to such other pre- vious Portuguese settlements as Salvador in Brazil or Goa in the Indian Ocean, might be a place to test such hypotheses about the effects of merchant capitalism on urban realities. 29</page><page sequence="30">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW African Cities and Transition to Capitalism The 19th-Century Urban Revolution The emergence of a new urbanization in varying degrees of de- velopment was obvious everywhere. It took place at the same time as the arrival of Western capitalism proper, which imposed a new commodity market based on direct import of manufactured goods and export of oil seeds in western Africa and in East Africa had a more indirect influence in the form of the firearms traffic through Indian Ocean brokers and slave traders. The new urbanization arose as early as the beginning of the century in western Africa, but only in the last third of it in central and eastern Africa. The rapid growth or revival of seaports reflected this change. Drastic change in the 19th century affected: -a long-distance economic interregional and international trade based on an internal growing productive activity; -an increasing ethnic, professional, religious and, in a word, social heterogeneity; -an expanding and changing urbanism connected with intense migrations accelerated by a growing complementarity between urban and rural areas. Western Africa Everybody knows that Yorubaland is a richly documentated case, as we benefit from many varied, if sometimes contradictory, studies (such as Bascom, 1955, 1959; Krapf-Askari, 1969; Lloyd, 1962; Mabogunje, 1968; Morton-Williams, 1964; Phillips, 1970; Roberts, 1978; Wheatley, 1970). Hausaland also appears as a privileged case. Here is progress from an urban civilization made of small centers to the flourishing number of large cities, each expressing a complex syn- thesis between varied and converging social forces: Lagos, a prime harbor (Mabogunje, 1962; Baker, 1974; Law, 1983); Abeokuta, a market center of the hinterland and a regional encounter between forest and grasslands incentive (Phillips, 1969); Ibadan, swollen from varied refugees of the Yoruba wars (Akinola, 1966; Cohen, 1969; Lloyd, Mabogunje and Awe, 1967); Ilorin, a city of exchange and interpene- tration between the Yoruba and Hausa peoples (Akorede, 1979); Kano, a Sahelian capital city which became a major cloth manufacturing center (Wittlesey, 1937; Frishman, 1977); or Katsina, a city on the desert border (Miller, 1937; Dihoff, 1970). Nevertheless the Yoruba or Hausa examples are not unique. The establishment of a multiple-centered urban network can be observed in Ashanti (Arhin, 1974), in the Dahomean area (Anignikin, 1986), in the Volta and Niger hinterland (Skinner, 1974: chap. 1), and in the Wolof kingdoms (yet to be studied as such). 30</page><page sequence="31">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Central and Eastern Africa In central and eastern Africa, at least towards the end of the century, similar phenomena occurred, even if their forms and the social background were rather different. An accelerated urbanization process certainly occurred, fostered by new trends of commerce and of political issues produced from, among other things, the emergence of the Zanzibar-Oman Sultanate and from the increased internal trade in slaves, ivory, and guns. Ports like Kilwa, Mombasa, Dar es Salaam, or Bugamoyo, market-places like Tabora and Ujiji (Brown, 1971), state capitals like Musumba of the Lunda (Randles, 1972) or the capital city of the Kuba (Vansina, 1978) could but develop and enlarge under the impact of an increasing international incentive, even if 19th-century urbanism was seriously disturbed by the ravages of an intensified slave trade. Therefore, while ports and market or mili- tary centers grew, the rest of the raided people probably scattered in the bush in precarious settlements so as to escape slave raiders and pillage or were decimated by the spread of rising epidemic diseases (such as sleeping sickness) all along the Rift encouraged by the progress of penetration. In fact, little is known about this urban his- tory, not because it did not exist, but because we lack scholarly information. What is known about the military camps of Msiri (except Wright, 1983), of Mirambo or Tippu-Tib, or even Rabah, except some scarce descriptions by early travellers or missionaries which have not as yet really been compiled and compared to other (oral, archeological) evidence? Paradoxically, with few exceptions on Ethiopia (see above), Zanzibar (Pearce, 1967), the Kuba kingdom (Vansina, 1978), or unpub- lished theses on Ujiji (Brown, 1973), Bugamoyo (Brown, 1972), or Dar es Salaam (Anthony, 1983), or studies focusing rather on markets networks and the labor force organization (Alpers, 1975; Cooper, 1983), more is known about the first generation of ancient deserted stone towns or medieval Swahili harbors (Kilwa, Gedi), in spite of poor sources and mediocre or nonexistent writing, than about the possible urban process represented by military posts and trading centers of the 19th century. At least prehistorian archeologists have asked the ques- tion of whether ancient ruins came from a rural-pastoral civilization or were some kind of urban vestige. This silence contrasts with the wealth of West African research on 19th-century urbanism and points to the necessity of promoting re- search in languages not exploited enough by modern social scientists: Swahili, Arab, or Portuguese. In eastern and central Africa, too, we may suppose the existence, besides large stable storage settlements such as harbors and major marketplaces, of a series of minor and probably mobile small settlements used as caravan stops, porter halts, military posts, and wandering slave-trade places, with a hierarchi- cal network of trading centers. Why would we call these obviously non-exclusively agricultural settlements towns in, let us say, the Akan or Yoruba area in the 16th or 18th century, while it would be 31</page><page sequence="32">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW supposed that only camps could exist in central Africa? Even if the military traumatism has been stronger here, the question is at least worth asking. A possible answer, proposed by Fred Cooper,5 might be differences in the impact of the slave trade on western and eastern Africa because centralization of the state was achieved prior to its be- ginning only in the former. This was true even of Yoruba cities, seen as city-states. It was true of Buganda as well, which had consoli- dated its power before the slave trade reached it, and therefore was not fundamentally transformed by it. On the contrary, elsewhere in eastern Africa the slave-trade routes could not be controlled by any one polity, and all were vulnerable to rival powers with alternative sources of arms and support, but this may as well have fostered the spread of Swahili culture, which followed the trade routes regardless of the rise and fall of political units along the way. Nevertheless, a late introduction of capitalism in eastern and central Africa accounts for a more prolonged duration of precapitalist forms of urbanization there; a specific social organization was pro- moted, based on women's rural labor, while men were massively recruited elsewhere for the army, the caravans, and other types of nonagricultural activities (Wright, 1983). This may have favored the genesis, emergence, and growth, in short, the history-especially in the sphere of influence of the eastern coast-of a series of small centers more or less diffusing the traditionally urban Swahili cul- ture. These centers in their turn may have resulted in the later selection, by the colonizers, of the first administrative and economic cities of the colonial times. This is only a hypothesis. It may suggest more temporal depth than is usually supposed in general African urban history. Southern Africa Southern Africa is still another case. For part of it, the 19th century is already colonial history, under the joint pressure of British occupation and of the internal Boers' progression. Nevertheless, in a transitional phase between ancient towns de- stroyed by the Mfecane and colonial cities, we certainly find, for example in Zululand, military settlements (probably more or less similar to the Ethiopian ones) gathering a large number of soldiers, boys and girls, women, servants, and slaves, whose main occupation was not to cultivate. All these nonproducers needed to be settled, cared for, fed, served, requiring not only a strong organization of power, but also networks of transportation and storage of produce, arms, and goods of all kinds. Another good example is the town of Mafikeng, founded by Christianized Barolong in the mid-19th century before the Southern Tswana chiefdoms were subjected to colonial administra- tion. Mafikeng's stadt-the site of the original town-continued to be a substantive African settlement serving as the African location when the British established their administrative center nearby, misnam- ing it Mafeking (Shillington, 1985). From the beginning, these places 32</page><page sequence="33">The Process of Urbanization in Africa constituted extraordinary melting pots all the more heterogeneous as many of their inhabitants came from recently and successively con- quered areas. A camp? A military town? Once more, the question has not yet been asked as such. Colonial Cities One generation ago, Georges Balandier (1985) described in the town the colonial situation where colonized were facing colonizers, and Franz Fanon opposed the "settlers' town" to the medina (1961: 31- 32). The colonial city concept has been recently reasserted (King, 1976; O'Connor, 1983). We need, however, to discuss it. The idea that the colonial city was a discrete class of urban phenomena has already been proposed: McGee explicitly identified the colonial city as being one of the three major classes of urbanization, with the other two be- ing the preindustrial city and the industrial one (1964: 178). Horvarth returns to this idea, connecting the colonial city model to a theory of colonialism, the colonial city being "the political, military, economic, religious, social and intellectual entrepot between the colonizers [part of them being settlers] and the colonized" (1969: 75). Is it really con- vincing? The risk is to place the colonial city merely as a bastion city of an earlier era, an explicit construction, symbolically and physically, of power set against a rural society whose relations of production have not been remade in a European image. The problem is thus to explain how African people condemned to live in town are obliged to adapt and change to enter modernization (read urbaniza- tion). This has been largely professed through the adaptive theory which gave birth to an abundant but now rather conventional litera- ture on adaptation (see section III below); an alternative to the adaptation argument is to say that African urban migrants made something of the city which their colonizers had not intended. The precapitalist/capitalist distinction contributes to a better understanding of the peculiarities of African cities of the 19th and 20th centuries: These cities existed in an age of capitalism, but in places where capitalist relations of production were still tenuous and contested. Is the colonial city only part of this whole, or in which way did colonialism create a specific situation which has to be iso- lated as such? Was it intrinsically different from semi-colonial cities, such as Monrovia, Addis Ababa, or Bangkok or Peking, that is, cities which were economically and even politically dependent but not formally dominated? The key difference is not only domination (Horvath 1969: 75); the fact of "one group controlling in varying de- grees the affairs of another" is rather universal. It may be that domination was embodied by a specific coercive framework involv- ing a foreign mother country, with institutional rules imposed by an external power and, on the spot, a more or less significant number of white settlers, the only ones officially in charge of controlling administration, economics, and even, at least partly, religion: in short, a politically and lawfully organized dependence for economic 33</page><page sequence="34">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW extra-oriented purpose. This characteristic of colonial cities is partic- ularly clear for Portuguese ones, perhaps because colonization lasted longer in Portuguese urban Africa than elsewhere. (See, on Portuguese varied colonial cities in Africa, Cahen, 1989; more specifically on LourenCo Marques, today Maputo, Lobato, 1970; and Penvenne, 1982; on Luanda, Amaral, 1968.) But we may wonder whether the same was not a de facto reality in semi-colonial cities, where foreign capital and businessmen (therefore a foreign political power) was equally prevalent, if not formally assertive. Is the main difference not so much colonization as peripheralization inside a world economy? This is the reason why colonization began to stabilize cities, which were often previously wandering towns. We must note that the same phenomenon occurred everywhere in Africa, whether in still independent or recently colonized countries; at the end of the 19th century, this was the case in Addis Ababa (see Pankhurst, 1961; Horvarth, 1969; Crummey, 1987) and for the Kibuga of Buganda before the British Protectorate (Gutkind, 1960, 1963). Furthermore, capitalist states colonizing Africa did not transfer into Africa their own political and economic patterns. Their purpose was different: not to industrialize and modernize, but to impose in a new context a directive and coercive dependent economy. Colonial as well as semi-colonial urbanization suited a system whose particular incentives and aims had little in common with the politics inside the mother countries, and therefore combined varied effective ele- ments which did not exist as such in the old metropoles. Colonial states had to adapt as well. Not only was colonial power original, but colonial structures had to accomodate to a society and world they could not-and partly did not want to-remake. This explains the questioning by recent authors on the "anomaly in the development of an ideal type colonial spatial system on the Kenyan coast" (Memon and Martin, 1976), because colonizing Africa adapted as much as col- onized Africa. A question remains concerning the social relations which were created in colonial cities. Clearly, the kinds of models developed for advanced capitalism by scholars like Castells (1977) are inappropriate. Colonial urbanization was the product of special kinds of political economies, societies, and cultures and cannot be separated from the processes based on colonial accumulation and domestic con- sumption which produced it. The earlier forms of colonial urbanism consisted of camps, forts, military settlements. In this former period, the trading fort model-the outpost of coercion and dependence-was the best tool for surveillance, and it quickly went along with eco- nomic goals (exploitation). But colonial officials still had the metropolitan models in their heads, and the way they symbolized civilization and power clashed with the sordid realities they created. From the 1920s on, a more sophisticated concept of an urban center emerged, and by the late 1940s, the coercive/dependent model was be- ing strongly questioned. The new colonial city was connected with 34</page><page sequence="35">The Process of Urbanization in Africa power, serving as both means and ends for colonial policy and economics. Therefore, within the colonial period, a periodization of urbanization is probably coeval to, and a result of, broader transna- tional factors (for example, depression and the World Wars). Unfortunately, only a few studies have extended this direction of research, which emerged only some years ago apropos labor and workers' history (see below, section III, 4: Labor, Household and Women's Studies). The connection between local and transnational factors explains why a large variety of colonial and semi-colonial ci- ties share common features all around the world, facilitating cross- cultural colonial urban studies. (See Ross and Telkamp, 1985.) But Africans had their models too and were trying to use urban space in particular ways. Cities were a privileged colonial place (lieu de colonisation) (Mbembe, 1989: 668-669), where native and colonial people and ideas interacted and mingled, either immediately or by later mediation, for the colonial state's dominion of the city was not uncontested. Native societies too tried to occupy some strategic sites, such as schools, missions, centers of communications, the labor market and marketplaces. They aimed at taking part of the resources those places controlled, whatever these resources might be, allocative resources or authoritative ones. Therefore we should not assume a mechanical correspondence between modes of production and of de- pendence on one hand, and forms of urbanization on the other hand; the occasional derivation from one to the other was complex and multiple. It is probably wiser to speak of colonial cities than of the colonial city (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988). Colonial Urbanization: Endurance and Change The last point raises a major issue: In spite of this major precapitalist/capitalist distinction, what kind of continuity through urbanization do we get in Africa? How does history help us to under- stand contemporary African cities? My answer: probably no more, no less, although differently, than for European (or Asian) cities. The first common point is space: Most African cities grew and remained close to the place where they first emerged, sometimes cen- turies ago. Though it is common to discover in colonial literature that colonization, and more usually French colonization, created cities, this is hardly true. To be sure, colonizers had to create new garrisons, ports, or railway stations, sometimes where nothing ex- isted before (such as Conakry or Nairobi). Military surveillance, market places ensuring the primary needs of colonial occupation forces, and new economic and political constraints provided as many incentives to initiate modern settlements: Dakar versus Saint-Louis in Senegal, Cotonou versus Porto-Novo in Dahomey. Most of the time, though, colonizers tried to use and adapt previous settlements, towns, villages, or clusters of villages (such as Swahili harbors, Yoruba towns, or marketplaces and villages close to the river for Kinshasa or Brazzaville) just because their needs were 35</page><page sequence="36">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW more or less the same as before. Urban settlements had to be easily maintained, fed, and controlled; they had to be located in the core of accessible trading areas and to have access to natural resources: rivers, roads, grasslands. Twin cities born from colonization near old capitals demonstrate these constraints, such as Khartoum- Omdurman (Hamdam, 1960; Rehfish, 1964; Stevenson, 1966), or Kampala adjoining the Kibuga in Uganda (Gutkind, 1960; 1963). Therefore, the colonizers tended to select preexistent cities rather than to create new ones, especially since practical ways to feed the cities had not been drastically changed due to modern international trans- portation technology (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988: 58-59). This choice probably resulted in suppressing more towns than in creating new ones (D'Almeida-Topor, "Quelques r6flexions sur une p6riodisation," in Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988: 25-26). The change was not so much an emergence of cities, but an alteration of the previous urban networks and hierarchies between small trading centers and new selected metropoles, most of them located along the coast, since colonization aimed at generalizing an outward-oriented market economy. The second common point is culture. It is insufficient and schematic to reduce it to a mere dichotomy between the traditional city and the modern (colonial) one. The present section was neces- sary t9 identify the extent to which traditional means, in fact, history, how complex it is, and how much a collective memory of this urban cumulative past may remain alive. Unfortunately, a longue-durme analysis of urbanization has rarely been done, notwith- standing the fascinating quality of the space studies which do exist (Marguerat, 1988; Gouellain, 1975). Most monographs of cities begin just before colonization. Only in the last twenty years has the urban migration boom drastically changed previous urban configurations. However, the urban past is still written in the core of many African cities, as much as it is in many European towns: Even if the Portuguese-built center of Mozambique Island is no longer a real city, the islands of Saint-Louis du Senegal and of Lagos, the centers of Omdurman or the Kibuga are as many living testimonies of the past. Besides architecture, the urban past deals with ideology and mentalities. African novels and movies may provide as many views as academic research. An attentive reading of novels written by Africans, most of them located in cities, offers valuable insights into the contradictions and conflicts experienced, on one side, by the ur- ban poor and, on the other, by an emerging political class still embroiled with inherited biases and habits based on clientism and religious charisma. We can still evoke some writings, such as Ngugi's Weep not Child, from the point of view of rural migrants to suggest their urban behavior as squatters. Also worth citing in this context is Modike Dikobi's The Marabi Dance, a novel set in the Doornfontein "slumyards" of 1930s Johannesburg. As Ville cruelle [Cruel City], by Eza Boto (alias Mongo Beti), gave as early as 1954 a severe description of urban contrasts in Tanga (Douala in Cameroun), 36</page><page sequence="37">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Le soleil des inddpendances is an extraordinary tale of the life of the uprooted urban poor in Abidjan (Kourouma, 1970); such too are Luandinho Vieira's writings on Luanda (1980) and Honwana's novels on Maputo shantytowns (1969). Buchi Emecheta's novels are fascinat- ing variations on the theme of the female condition in the city. On the other side, Ousmane Sembene's novel (1973) and film Xhala are unforgettable pictures of one of these new bourgeois whose imitation of Western standards results in confusion and ridicule. Urban history deals also with land inheritance, land tenure, and land laws, much of which is of too recent gestation to explain solely in terms of rural culture (Anignikin, 1986). For this a more de- veloped urban-oriented scholarship is needed (but see, for example, McGee, 1979, and on Zanzibar, McQuillan, 1984). Above all, it is nec- essary to contest the traditional/modern dichotomy and to understand that African urbanization is better analyzed as an indigenous phe- nomenon rather than as an imported one. This is the subject matter of the next section. Urban and Social Change Urban social anthropology was a strongly developed topic in the Anglo-Saxon literature of the 1950s. In an excellent overview of this material, J.D.Y. Peel (1980) underlines how little at that time histori- ans de metier had as yet contributed to the making of an African urban history. This anglophone tradition dealt mainly with histori- cal anthropology and was little influenced by French structuralism. It produced a vast literature on cities and their social problems in the form of either case studies or theoretical essays. In spite of innumer- able monographs, it maintained the same position after the beginning of the 1960s, influenced as it still was by the heritage of colonization, by its consistently dualistic view which opposed a backward tradi- tional past to an urbanized modernization. This approach conceived the urban phenomenon as an expression of modernity and thus de- velopment. The general features of a modern, developed society (more exactly, the Western world) were epitomized as an ideal type which had undergone a gradual, qualitative evolution from a lower to a higher stage via increasing specialization and functional interde- pendence, especially between institutions and people (Datta, 1989: 5). As Cooper notes: "as Africans flocked onto cities in ever greater numbers in the 1950s, the dualist approach to urbanization suggested that they were entering the mainstream of history" (1983: 12). By the late 1960s, it looked as if nearly everything had already been said on the scale and pace of urbanization in this transitional period and the changing role of the city from colonization to independence. A major anthology was then published which gathered the works of most au- thors and summarized their conclusions, but it was not on Africa specifically (Breese, 1969). Later on, what had begun as an attempt to ground urban theory in actual African case studies and original re- 37</page><page sequence="38">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW search partly stagnated, mostly because it tended to become repetitive by multiplying similar monographs all dealing with the same period of time (from World War II to the first years of independence). Nevertheless, some prominent studies, as we shall see, partly re- newed the theoretical ground in the 1970s. New trends will later appear in other directions, inspired by social historians (Cooper 1983, 1987) and sociologists, on labor and proletarianization connected with urbanization (Castells, 1977). New inquiries on urbanism and archi- tecture and the interrelationship between the built and the people have only recently been developed. The first question: What is the nature of change is usually supposed as being given, did it in fact represent continuity or rupture? Most authors, either explicitly or implicitly, express the idea of a rup- ture. Nevertheless they focus both on the process of change and on the expressions of social continuity through accommodation. The concept of a colonial city is usually presented alongside the idea of a world system and a world dependency which generates the same model of cities born from colonization whatever the nature of previous urban- ization. In confronting colonial cities all over the colonized world, in Africa as elsewhere, we find little reference to the varied precolonial situations. In Ross and Telkamp's comparative study only the first chapter deals with "Colonial Cities: Global Pivots of Change," (1985: 7- 32) and a short conclusion defines a colonial city as "a city of exter- nal dependence . . . with an indigenous population" (233-235). Most of the case studies are silent on the processural impacts of imperialism-taken as about the same everywhere as an implacable entity-on local social urban change, Cape Town, for example, being perceived as a "synthesis in the dialectic of continents" (Ross, 1985: 105-122). Often, the issue of which factors are due to the precolonial heritage and which to colonialism is either not questioned or left unclear: hence the importance of recent analyses of the on-the-spot re- lationship between the urbanites-elite, bourgeoisie, political class, labor force-and the place-the built, the working-site, the housing, and the administrative apparatus. Another point: Are African urban- ites "men of two worlds" (Little, 1957), "strangers to the city" (Plotnicov, 1964)? Or does change not necessarily imply social and psychological conflict and negotiation (Brokensha, 1966; Wallerstein, 1966)? Earlier cultural anthropologists and the Marxist school have, for various reasons, theoretically emphazised conflict. But, in fact, most of the studies assume a continuous progress in the resolution rather than the explosion of contradictions. Here the heritage of the literature from the 1960s is prevalent. These studies are so numerous that a survey based on themes is possible: -Social and political change, most of it dealing with social urban adjustment, part of it concerning urban-rural migration 38</page><page sequence="39">The Process of Urbanization in Africa (this latter more often investigated by post-colonial economists and/or sociologists), and part of it addressing the struggle for urban policy which, under the final control of colonizers, urged a growing competition among the elite. -Economic activities of the modern city (remarkably neglected unless presented as a general framework, although some work by economists does this without stressing the urban quality of what is being studied). Recent francophone re- search, by economic anthropologists, has focused on the so- called informal sector. -Labor studies, which have focused more on the emergence and activism of a labor force as an institution and social group than of its relevance as an urban group. -The relationship between people and urban space, still little investigated as such. Urban Social Adaptation A number of influential works appeared at the end of the 1950s. The founders of the "adaptation tradition" (Cooper, 1983: 44) have been, in different ways, Georges Balandier (1955); Michael Banton (1957); J. Clyde Mitchell (1954), particularly known by his theoretical essays; A.L. Epstein (1958); Philip Mayer (1963); and Kenneth Little (1957). Curiously, Peter Gutkind's work receives fewer citiations, notwithstanding his clear depiction of urban transition, possibly be- cause of his Marxist label, though his case study on Kampala (1960, 1963) was seminal. These authors succeeded a first generation of merely descriptive and moreover static monographs written at the beginning of the 1950s: quantitative facts were collected about the special aspects of an urban community's composition and activities. Such was the case for Busia on Sekondi-Takoradi (1948) or Acquah on Accra (1958). The in- novative concept was change. Epstein, one of the first, had the idea to measure it through time. He introduced a historical dimension, analyzing three successive stages of conflicts in an urban mining community: 1940, the 1940s, then 1950-1954 (1958). He discovered trib- alism was not a static concept but had to evolve from a tribal behavior to social ones. These authors built their theories on their own fieldwork. They have also initiated, or generated, an impressive series of other case studies, mainly in the 1960s, but also in the 1970s. Chronologically, the theories shifted from a dualistic view to a more complex one: -The rural-urban continuum asserted that only a primary city could emerge from folk societies, who had to be detribalized, hence, disorganized in order to give birth to urban life. 39</page><page sequence="40">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW -Then, on the eve of the 1960s, some case studies emerged which, although still mainly descriptive and analytical, nev- ertheless countered this earlier idea and developed a concept of continuity and change. The concept was still dualistic in that it opposed a negative pole (tradition) to a positive one (modernity) as it acted through detribalization by acculturation, but it did insist on the role of Africans themselves as "acculturative agents" Little (1957, 579). While Little observed West African urbanization, South Africa and the Copperbelt were the two main foci for case studies through proletarian- ization. Monica Wilson and Archie Mafeje (1963), following Mayer, studied in a South African township a process of absorption from unschooled migrants to townsmen, through semi-urbanized ones, thanks to privileged go-betweens be- tween rural and urban values: successively, "home-boys," kinsmen, traditional rites, churches and schools, clubs, classes, and leaders helping to solve disputes by their arbitra- tion. They concluded that urbanization was a social process, the cohesion of the group being strictly connected with its function. Thus the main concept of adaptation or accommodation was analyzed through two different methods: -The analysis of specific institutions, their past situation, their present one, offered a process of change denoting a complex rhythm from native forms to modern ones (both taken for granted). An important series of studies on so-called voluntary associations flourished. They covered associations of dancing as well as trade unions or political parties. Kenneth Little popularized the concept for western Africa (1957). He divides voluntary associations into tribal unions and syncretist cults, groups concerned with mutual benefits and recreation, and associations based on a common interest in the Christian re- ligion or in Western cultural or social pursuits, including the role of women and of the younger men and the emergence of new social classes. The theme of voluntary associations, which comes from British literature on urbanization, shows how social anthropological writing on African cities in the 1950s or early 1960s reflected British understanding of (especially Victorian) urban problems perceived at that time. In other words, once more, how far is African urbanism couched in the conceptual categories and vocabulary used by metropolitan scholars apropos British metropoles (Rodwin, 1984)? In Africa these voluntary associations were seen as mediating structures, supposedly complementary to western- ization and acting to help subdue the daily contradictions of 40</page><page sequence="41">The Process of Urbanization in Africa social and economic reality, either through accommodation or conflict or both. The adaptive and integrative function of vol- untary associations was seen as a useful model for cross- cultural comparisons. With the enthusiasm born from the emergence of independence and by analogy with British local urban self-management, they were also understood as tools for democratization. This made it possible for Africans to re- cover, in the new urban context, the sense of common purpose which in traditional African society was normally channeled through tribal organizations (Wallerstein, 1964: 65- 138). Some francophone scholars also tried to explore this field (Meillassoux, 1968). The Marxist school probably felt more comfortable within this framework, which eschewed any individualistic psychological interpretation. Quoted less fre- quently, the study of Larteh, a small and ethnically homogeneous town based on cocoa farming not far from Accra, includes economical and ecological considerations to help us understand the easy accommodation to change and a syncretist ability to absorb new institutions (Brokensha, 1966). The author rejects a series of stereotypes, such as the bond be- tween change and social and psychological conflict-African people having to choose between two worlds-or economic progress conditioned by individualism and the breakdown of traditional culture. -The behavioral analysis of individuals facing changing institutions was connected to the concept of choice (Mayer, 1963). In the case study of East London, a South African indus- trial center, Mayer opposed Red to School (animist to Christian) Xhosa migrant people of the first generation; both face the situation of a city offering economic, administrative, and occupational diversities and optional alternatives. This compelled the migrant to make cultural and structural choices, while his original, less diversified, and more coer- cive rural background represented the given, the inescapable. Why, facing the same situation, were migrants either encapsulated in their ethnic conformism, refusing to explore the new local facilities, always meeting the same people and obeying the same moral rules, or, on the contrary, seizing the new opportunities, adapting and changing? This meant not only situational adaptation, but also individual choice. Plotnicov insisted on the complexity of this individual process. He analyzed "the adjustments individuals make to modern condi- tions of urban development in a West African community" (1967: 3). Given significant areas of social interaction-ethnic, kinship, neighborly, political, occupational, recreational, religious-he com- bined his analysis of "situational selectivity" with "ego-oriented" 41</page><page sequence="42">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW observation. Using the intensive study of a few persons through their fields of social action, Plotnicov understood their social behavior not only from their respective social categories but also from their per- sonal perception of their identities (1967: 12-13). The chosen method was to proceed by sixteen portraits, systematizing the approach previously proposed by Epstein who had demonstrated through the network of relationships rebuilt from an individual's activities and visits in a day (Chanda, an urbanite living in Nola, a small town of the Copperbelt) that his social and moral milieu was neither ethnical nor modern, but referred to a prestige and social status which inter- mingled the persistence of tribal customs and values, the modification and adaptation of others, and the emergence of specifi- cally urban customs, usages, and attitudes. Social and cultural change was a result of the whole (Epstein, 1961). The "antistructural emphasis on microbehavioral process" promoted in the 1960s (Southall, 1976: 276), which produced some excellent empirical stud- ies but few effective generalizations, is re-emerging today, although somewhat differently, in research that relies on "life-stories." Both institutions and behavior were examined in a situational perspective, not always avoiding a succession of static snapshots, be- cause they depended on external determinants of the context in which town-dwellers interact (Mitchell, 1966). As usual, the more convincing studies appear to be those using both methods. The more recent ones also benefited from previous methodological approaches. Even if Aidan Southall concedes that in the past anthropologists exac- erbated the problem of ethnicity and that the matter needs to be set straight, he still claims as late as 1976: "Ethnicity, though frequently given a false emphasis, remains the paramount problem of Africa" (1976: 275). Meanwhile, the concept of ethnicity has altered. It is no longer studied only in terms of migration and urbanization, that is, as an aspect of the transition from tribe to nation: Enid Schildkrout proposes rather to accentuate the dichotomy between hosts and strangers in culturally plural societies. The problem is identical "whether the society is defined as a city, a nation, a tribe, a town, or whatever unit is selected for analysis" (1978: 11). In the case of one particular stranger community in Ghana, Kumasi zongo, including immigrants from a number of areas from Northern Ghana and surrounding countries, Schildkrout opposes eth- nicity to a kind of folk ethnography focusing on what is supposed to be a particular ethnic group. Ethnicity means dealing with complex processes of sociocultural change through which people conceptualize their distinct identity. For strangers to assert their cultural difference as aliens may involve deliberate ignorance or even denial of previ- ous differences in the values and behavior of members of the community coming from different ethnic groups. From their inception, the Kumasi zongo has been ethnically heterogeneous. This heterogeneity and the structure of the stranger community facilitated the development of common linguistic and behavioral codes, entail- 42</page><page sequence="43">The Process of Urbanization in Africa ing the adoption of new values and new ways of doing: such were "Islamization" and "Hausaization" (partly based on linguistic patterns) and the resultant culture as Zongo culture. This inevitably leads to cultural integration, but also implies increasing alienation and isolation from both local Asante and national Ghanaian culture and society. Incorporation into the zongo community confers benefits for participants in long-distance trading networks. But it neither fa- cilitates participation in the local and national power structures nor insures their protection. The remaining manifestations of regional ethnicities within the zongo can be seen, in part, as a response to this vulnerability. It functions as a positive source of identification, but also as a defensive strategy. Within the zongo ethnic identities persist which cannot be fully identified with economic cleavages, even if they reflect an emerging class structure, since there are no really successful ethnic monopolies in trade or in occupations, and no group has been success- ful in establishing total economic or political control. Political integration in Kumasi zongo does not imply the absence of politically articulated ethnic communities (such as the Mossi studied in the book). Mossi identity and ethnicity clearly provide many kinds of support for migrants, particularly of the first generation. It may some- times provide a strategy for mobility within the sociopolitical context of the zongo. However, it is also a response to the impossibility of becoming socially incorporated into the culturally dominant Hausa community, which has become a reference group, but associated with qualities which are individually attainable. On the other hand, peo- ple may quite consciously feel that they are assimilating Hausa culture, but at the same time reject the idea of a status hierarchy based on ethnicity which would establish the hegemony of the Hausa, and, appealing to Muslim ideology, they may emphasize the irrelevance of ethnicity, including their own. It is precisely the lack of congruence between ethnicity and class which inhibits consensus about the nature of ethnic stratifications (Schildkrout, 1978: 264-277). In the case of Nyeri, a small Kenyan town, Dutto became aware that it might not be so significant to focus on groups and associations, as these were per se rather marginal to the life of most people in town. He attempted to connect townsmen's behavior with the social matrix created by the commercial, religious, and administrative framework of the city in connection with the surrounding rural ar- eas and the larger national system. He characterized the dynamism of urban life both by overall change in the social system and by changes in the individuals as they participated in urban institutions and become involved in activities (Dutto, 1975: xiv-xv). The result is a situation of pluralistic ties where people who more or less participate strive to develop new identities and a variety of life-styles. By pre- serving and modifying the old while accepting the new, they develop a fresh, unified world of thought and life which they call and see as their own (p. 209). Marc Ross developed the same line in two studies 43</page><page sequence="44">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW on Nairobi (1973; 1975), one on the Mathare Valley settlements focus- ing on the nature of their community institutions as well as political integration, the other on the political and social life of Nairobi as a whole. Therefore, institutions and individuals became changing variables in a changing world with the final idea that "tradition is change" (Brokensha, 1966) before historians discovered more generally (not only in towns) that tradition is invention. The modern city was previously seen for the urban African as "something given, a datum, with which he has to come to terms and to which he has to adapt" (Epstein, 1961: 116). Only recently was the idea frankly expressed that choice meant creativity as much as adap- tation. African urbanites originated their urban life, incorporating their previous culture, religions, and symbols into new models. (See, on Zambia, Jules-Rosette, 1981.) Urbanization is not only the social process by which people adjust to urban life. African people only had to adapt to towns-perceived as an independent variable-in the most recent period, that is to say when the proposed town model was im- posed from outside in an exagggerated manner. As soon as we reject the eurocentric presupposition that the African person would be per se a homo ruralis, a country man, we could just as well on the contrary start from the idea that the African people also made out of their towns what they are and what they became because the city was, and probably will be again (after the brief episode of the colonial authoritarian period), made by the Africans and not the converse. A town is not a given entity; it is made of a series of spatial and social structures (the mining compound, the native location, the slum), shaped by its builders and users, which are more specific than "the city" (Cooper, 1983: 13). The concept of an urban brokerage has arisen. "Middlemen" were first referred to as persons who successfully bridge "the gap be- tween life in the modern sector of the town and life in ethnic enclaves and rural areas." Far from being marginal people, con- demned to live in two worlds, in neither of which they quite belong, they "do belong to the various worlds in which they participate," especially in urban-centered communities, contributing to system- wide integration (Hanna and Hanna, 1959: 21). The urban milieu ap- pears complex, constituted by many brokers ranging from the Beni dancers of the Copperbelt (Ranger, 1976) to the prostitutes of Nairobi (Bujra, 1975; White, 1983) and enriched by an urban popular culture in the making since the very beginning of colonization. In this con- text it is significant that popular art flourished in town, as opposed to traditional art in the rural areas (Barber, 1987). Urban Migrations The process has been more or less the same for rural-urban migration. It was first analyzed in a largely economic, schematic way, seasoned with a pinch of sociology. The push-pull theory, with the economic variables accentuated in the case of western Africa 44</page><page sequence="45">The Process of Urbanization in Africa rural-urban migrations, combined with the emphasis anthropologists placed on the corporate solidarity of peasant societies, isolated factors pushing migrants to leave their rural homes as the result of economic hardship and pulling them by the attraction of urban opportunities (Elkan, 1967). The theory insisted as much on sociological innovation as on economic incentive. Some authors stressed migration to the city as a recognized symbol of boys becoming men (for example, Mitchell, 1967). A quantitative approach, analyzed by economists, prevailed in the 1960s. It aimed at defining the conditions for full employment and was derivative of a dual economy model, born in the 1950s, which assumed a direct connection between migration and spatial income differentials (Kelley, Williamson, and Cheetham, 1972). The Todaro and Harris approach developed a theoretical framework to show why continued rural-urban migration in African countries repre- sented a rational economic decision despite high levels of urban unemployment (1970). They argued that rising unemployment is due to a rural-urban earning differential sufficient to induce excessive migration. The remedy was to equalize the expected urban wages and the rural ones, a measure partly realized through the decreasing pos- sibility of finding a job in the city. The prescription had to be completed by policies for rural as well for urban employment. Following this theory for Tanzania, Sabot developed a quantitative model for the role of education and for the adjustment of the educa- tional composition of the rural-urban migration stream to changing employment opportunities in urban areas (1979). Though poverty was usually stressed as a main factor of rural- urban migration, more recently Sandbrook has reminded us that sev- eral authors have demonstrated how greatly the migratory stream was differentiated, with an increasing group of relatively well- educated people migrating to cities: "The more formal education a per- son in the rural areas possesses, the more likely he or she will be to move to town" (1982: 47). Most sociological studies on urban migrations went hand in hand with the adaptive theories on urban- ization (for example, Byerlee, 1974). The result was an variegated turnover, subdivided into mere circular (frequent and repetitive), oscillatory (longer and eventually permanent), and linear (or defini- tive) migration (Basham, 1978: 66). The idea of individual choice based on a double purpose corrected this mechanism, the former being quantitative (to maximize one's wages, higher in town than in the rural area) and the latter, qualitative (the degree of probability of job employment in town) (Todaro, 1971). The intention of Mabogunje's work was to underline that rural- urban migration, as a system, was a complex of interacting elements, concerned not only with why people migrate but also with all the implications and ramifications of the process, among which is a propensity to migrate more or less rapidly in response to impulses or stimuli from the environment. Migrancy results from a series of ad- 45</page><page sequence="46">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW justments between a rural control subsystem based on kinship, overpopulation, and environmental deterioration, and an urban one connected to residential and occupational incentives. The stimulus to migrate varies not only according to the ethnic basis but also because of the dynamic factors of skill differentiation and status advance- ment. It is also related to the extent of the integration of rural and urban activities into the national economy, to the degree of aware- ness of opportunities, and to the social and economic expectations of the migrants, not only for themselves but also for their children (Mabogunje, 1970). A little later, Parkin similarly asserted that town and country are necessarily linked together, collectively "responsive to develop- ments affecting distant urban or rural members of the same social groups," and therefore that the rural and urban areas "have to be re- garded as part of a single field of relations made up of a vast criss- crossing of peoples, ideas and resources" (1975: 3). This was a response to a long-lasting British transposition of particular envi- ronmental categories from the metropolitan to the colonial societies, "of which the basic dichotomy between 'town' and 'country' was one of the more important" (King 1980: 212, 223-24). Nevertheless, though Parkin begins by approving Amin's economic approach, he quickly rehabilitates the "extra-economic" motivations. The rest of his intro- duction is based on ethnicity and its influence on urbanites. Like most authors, he insists on the influence of rural mental and social structures on the influx of migrants to the town; in a later study, which focuses on Luo migrants, he develops the implications of ur- ban residence and of socioeconomic change (education, wage dependency, political uncertaincy) (1978). He explains how the recourse to images drawn from the rural sector enables ethnic cohesiveness, and why significant differences in ethnic solidarity result from different attitudes towards and use of rural, traditional images. Once more, he pays little or no attention to the flow to the countryside of people, ideas, and culture; only Caldwell, ten years before, emphazised how city culture permeated rural areas, making adjustment easier for later migrants (1969: 219). This is certainly a major idea, unfortunately little investigated: Migrants, just because they decided to migrate, have already changed before arriving in town. They were urbanized at home. We need to apprehend the extent to which the change already occurred there in order to evaluate and explain the varied cultural distinctions between the town and the countryside. Neither of them are uniform, both of them are in pro- cess, the final result being rurbanization. Finally, it was concluded that categorizing too much resulted in sterility: "Whether described in terms of a mathematical 'gravity flow' model on the geographical level, in terms of a 'push-pull' model on the economic level, or in terms of a psychic cost 'adaptation' model on the sociopsychological level, the resulting picture was reassur- ingly simple" (Janet Abu Lughod in Du Toit and Safa, 1975). It must be 46</page><page sequence="47">The Process of Urbanization in Africa agreed that cityward migration is a multidimensional phenomenon. Migrants are social and economic actors subject to complex sets of conflicting pressures and interests which themselves change over time and in the very act of decision making (Brian Du Toit, in Du Toit and Safa, 1975). In fact, nearly ten years earlier, Caldwell once more had expressed the same idea when he described, in an extremely concrete and lucid way-on a demographic, historical, economic, and cultural level-the case of Movement to Ghana's Towns (1969). Closer to Caldwell and opposed to the cultural interpretation most frequently proposed in the 1960s by anglophone anthropologists, some francophone, Marxist, economic anthropologists asserted the economic, both collective and individual, rationality of the urban mi- grant. In a rather provocative way, Samir Amin asserted that the cultural variables and motivations for the actor's choice and decisions concerning migration were "completely predetermined by the overall strategy determining the 'allocation of factors' (i.e. the organization of economic exploitation)." Migration resulted from a rationalization of a situation basically defined by factors beyond the migrant's control (Amin, 1974: 88-93). The gist of this dependency approach was to emphasize the exploitation (resource transfer) and impoverishment (rural-urban migration) that occurs with the concentration of resources and power to the big cities. Due to an overemphasis on relations of exchange and the transfer of surplus (from the Third World to the West and from the countryside to the town), little significance was attributed to the individual society within the global system. Those tensions or conflicts between differ- ent classes which were generated within the urban system played little part in analyses basing themselves on the dependency or world system approaches; both the state and civil society appeared as pas- sive instruments for capitalist interests. Recently, this imbalance has been vigorously criticized (Feagin and Smith, 1987). Nevertheless, other studies edited by Samir Amin (1975) along with Meillassoux's works (1981) also insisted on the migrants' indi- vidual ability to rationalize their economic possibilities. Migrants were not only lured to the towns by fanciful and largely erroneous ideas about urban opportunities and urban life as, Rayfield notes (1974: 164), most anthropologists emphasized at the time. Urban workers were not necessarily encapsulated in their traditional way of life by social and ideological conservatism or morality; a vital necessity obliged them to organize more efficiently their survival through the maintenance or even the reinforcement of their rural background. Later Sandbrook (1982) and Iliffe (1987) integrated these factors into their global social analysis emphasizing the multiple cul- tural facets of an economic interpretation of the urban-rural interrelationship, connected both to rural poverty and with the dependence theory (see below). Progressively the analyses have shifted from forced labor and labor migrations during colonization (Amin, 1974; Van Onselen, 1977, 47</page><page sequence="48">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW 1982) to post-colonial migrations connected to unemployment and the informal sector. Gutkind was one of the first to anticipate the problem. As early as 1969, he asserted: "The study of new groups such as the unemployed could become the core of African studies in the future" (1969: 364). He announced the informal sector concept given currency in 1972 in a famous report on unemployment in Kenya (ILO, 1972) and largely developed later (Sandbrook, 1982). Now the point of agreement for everybody is the interdepen- dence between urban and rural economies and societies. The rural- urban networks emphasize the attachment of newcomers and returnees to both city and country economic and social resources (Berry, 1985). Up and down flows from and to the city may be com- plementary or reversed depending on the ecology, the national economy, or the international market. Urban people (concerned with the urban wage economy) need rural connections (for food supplies as well as for agricultural export commodities) for economic reasons as much as for sociological ones, and vice versa. Therefore, the migra- tion process does not only proceed from ethnicity: conversely, it is the rural-urban network of kin which the migration processes create and sustain (Weisner, 1976: 207). It is necessary at this point to differentiate the times and places when and where urban migrations were free (at least theoretically)-western Africa and, to a certain extent, central Africa (Richards, 1952)-from those where coercion was the official rule- Kenya and the mining compounds of Southern Africa. In both cases a colonial periodization helps us to understand why urban migrations proper started as a result of economic liberalism around the 1930s, in- cluding the highly controlled case of Belgium Congo compound, part of a paternalistic coercive system. Union Minibre du Haut-Katanga, confronted with a serious lack of labor, promoted as early as the mid- 1920s an attractive labor market and favored a stable urban popula- tion of miners. By the late 1920s, Elisabethville provided a viable set of alternatives. Africans had in fact two distinct choices as to the kind of urban life they wanted to lead. The camps of the Union Minibre offered good food, housing, and medical care, but relatively low salaries and little autonomy for miners who became members of a rigid hierarchy. The cite indigene had smaller employers who might offer higher salaries, but also independents' quarters, reserved for those Africans who did not work for a European company on a regular basis, where the living standard was much lower than that in the Union Minitre camp, but where they enjoyed greater freedom. Regardless of these differences and in contrast to the earlier period, Elisabethville had by then become a desirable place to live for thou- sands of Africans (Fetter, 1976: 94-115). Elsewhere, before the economic depression of the 1930s, most urban migrations remained temporary and seasonal, because rural cash crops' hourly returns were still usually higher than urban wages. Dakar and the Senegalese peanuts economy was quite typical, 48</page><page sequence="49">The Process of Urbanization in Africa and Kano, one of the largest towns of the interior, was equally repre- sentative. The Africans did not flood continuously and irreversibly into the cities. Rather, the cities seasonably turned into a sort of population storehouse but did not grew linearly; a trade crisis, an epidemic, or a war (like that of 1914-1918) could put a halt to expan- sion. From the 1930s, during the Great Depression because of rural impoverishment and even more after 1935, and above all after the Second World War, as the global rhythm of demographic growth accelerated and the need for cheap labor increased, cities began to ex- pand. Marxist social scientists explain that the countryside was the locus of reproduction for capitalist production in the city. This over- exploitation enabled the employers to pay low wages thanks to the importance of the back and forth migration between town and coun- try, thus the absence in Africa of the dialectic of market and labor that lent European capitalism its dynamism (Meillassoux, 1981). Long after coercion and forced labor ceased to act as precipitating factors in labor migration in western or central Africa (Uganda: Richards, 1952), a specific system based on a reserve army of rural labor force enforced the southern African authoritarian turn- over based on short-term contracts (Arrighi, 1967). In the case of the "South African Migrant Labor System" (1975), Magubane demonstrated how migrant labor and slave wages drew Africans from all over southern and central Africa into the capitalist economy, creating the conditions which spread the effect of capitalist exploitation over a far wider territory than everywhere else in the world. Rather than the classical push-pull theory, Gordon (1977) introduced, in the case of Namibia, the more convincing concept of an ever-increasing spiral movement: the shortage of manpower, resulting from the rapid turnover rate and the employers' methods of organization, causes a systematic redeployment of recruited workers, and in turn inspires a policy of low pay and long working hours. Unskilled and oppressed, the workers are frustrated by poor wages, irregular bonuses, extra hours, and the early end of their careers. The whites' control is all the more intrusive as the manpower is unqualified, inexperienced, and numerically insufficient. Everything encourages workers to re- turn home, where they have been obliged to leave their families, as soon as possible, especially as the rapid turnover and legal prohibition make it impossible to establish protective trade unions on the compound. The common fate is that of an unceasingly increasing number of migrant workers trapped in a vicious circle, with each new contract implying an absence longer than the previous one. Enlarged as a general mechanism of labor migration, this perception results in the current theory of a cumulative process of urban misery (see below: 5. Poverty, household and the informal sector). 49</page><page sequence="50">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW Policy and the City Few authors questioned the place of power by itself and the role of the city as a concrete tool, which exists in material built form, used to impose its rule; nevertheless Home (1976) noted that a contra- diction lay between, on one side, colonizers' need for a city used as a center for their colonial political economy, and, on the other side, their reluctance to sanction urban growth. The topic originally ap- peared as a variant of the tradition/modernity approach. The method involved juxtaposition of the urban community and rural background to verify, on a larger scale, how African life was ruled before colonial contact (Miner on Timbuctoo, 1965). Nevertheless Joan Vincent's study of a small-scale but plural urban trading center at Gondo in Uganda introduced new questions (1971). She analyzed in the longue dur&amp;e (19th and 20th centuries) how ethnicity proved early to be inadequate in explaining the emergence of multiplex relations existing between the various members of a polyethnic urban commu- nity. Terms like role and status certainly helped to isolate the parts played by people in social life. But what was fundamental is that roles and statuses had to be legitimated by new economic and ecologi- cal factors, progressively giving way to an open, polycultural, integrated community. The colonial interference that created municipal institutions, townships in British areas (and communes de plein exercice in French ones) instigated situational selections of var- ious forms of identification on the basis of sex, age, occupation, religion, politics, and prestige as well as those based on a previously supposed rigid ethnicity. Once more the city tends to disappear behind the social group, to become merely a background. I am not convinced by Peel's argument according to which the best hope for the development of an African urban history is a Weberian inclination to focus on politics (1980: 273). Nevertheless, Abner Cohen's Customs and Politics in Urban Africa (1969) signaled a turning point. Both authors focused on the manipula- tion of tradition and customs by minority groups in the city, demonstrating how ethnicity was politics: how the Hausa used it as a weapon in their struggle to retain control of their economic base (trade in cattle), as Kenyans did to preserve their jobs. Most studies focused on the role of political elites and the competition between the old powers and the new intelligentsia, some- times taking the form of a biography (Post and Jenkins, 1973), sometimes of a life history (Honwana, 1988), or occasionally of a township monograph, sometimes deploying the concept of a factional system (Hopkins, 1972). Three successive studies which focus on the same case, Lagos throughout the colonial and post-colonial periods (Baker, 1974; Cole, 1975; Barnes, 1986), help us to understand the vari- ous possible approaches. Baker asks how the exercise and distribution of political processes and influence in a given community were affected by urbanization. Once more, though she claims the necessity to avoid a mere "detribalization" or 50</page><page sequence="51">The Process of Urbanization in Africa "Westernization" approach, the colonial city is given as such, as are the precolonial "tribal" structures. The question remains to analyze how the latter adapts to the former. In spite of a rather heavy theoretical introduction claiming the inadequacy of Western or rather American analyses of the nature of the power structure in local urban politics (elites versus competing groups, reputational versus decision- making approach), which today sounds rather obvious, her "new ap- proach" is mainly an empirical one. She supplies a historical background through an enumeration of the varied "political resources": a small Anglo-African elite, several newspapers, ethnic groups varied in origin, wealth, education, and Islam, looking at practices, as well as a number of parties, their functioning and fi- nancing and their urban electoral patterns. Her thesis mainly lies in opposing the "formal structure of Government" (colonial then post- colonial institutions) to the evolution of chieftaincy, with a small part given to the "unassertive influence" of market-women, the whole concluding in a progressive "indigenization" of urban politics. Certainly this is a useful case study. It is not, however, a theoretical revolution. One year later, Cole intended to elucidate the political response of "Lagos society" to colonial rule in a rather less comprehensive way. After the unavoidable historical chapter which aimed to define the "structure of traditional politics," and in spite of a promising but unanswered question on what in the Lagos traditional politics was customary (p. 19), he focuses on the role of the traditional elite and the emergence of modern elite politics, mainly through a series of prominent biographies. At last Peace (1979) and Barnes correct this elitist view of politics by explaining how the ordinary people of the town may either gain (or think they may gain) sufficient stature to play their part of power or secure access to political institutions above them. Barnes' answer is clientelism, which emerges as a key politi- cal process for maintaining stability, expanding social opportunities, fostering integration, and rather efficiently avoiding class conflict. A chronological analysis of these case studies shows how they incorpo- rated theoretical progress in social sciences. Few other authors have insisted on the necessity of measuring the global game and balance between varied groups of pressure and classes in the making-popular, recently informal, as well as elites- to understand the political stake. The method enabled Skinner, in his Ouagadougou (1973), to enumerate the varied parameters needed to grasp the globality of the social, economic, and ecological dimensions which helped to create and change the city through history. Therefore, they in turn may aid us to understand how the city moved from a traditional royal seat to a modern colonial administrative center. More recent studies have endeavored to investigate how ur- banization has affected the practice and distribution of influence. We can see the transition from a social anthropology of change to the precise modalities of urban land speculation (Mann, 1987; Lepape, 51</page><page sequence="52">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW 1985), based on both an economic and prestige calculation, and the reinforcement of class exploitation. One of the more brilliant examples of the changing methods of investigation and perception of urban political evolution is a rela- tively recent collective study on Freetown which, apropos the same topic (Harrel, Howard, and Skinner, 1978), helps measure the gap between the one time pioneering study by Banton (1957) and our modern transdisciplinary thought. The main difference is probably that history is no longer seen as a framework, but as an agent which helps us to understand the ways in which political, economic, social, and demographic factors interacted to shape the character of relations within the city, and why the notion of an urban-rural dichotomy has to be rejected from the beginning. Freetown, as a port and warehouse, was closely connected to its hinterland and to international trade interlocking indigenous and overseas trade which existed since 1792 at the earliest. After a short historical survey, Banton states that "at the end of the 19th century, Freetown society was sharply divided into three strata: Europeans, Creoles, Natives," plus, later, Lebanese and Indians (p. 9). Categories were given, and "adaptation" came into play. In Harrel, Howard, and Skinner's Community Leadership, history and the city crafted ethnic communities throughout the two last centuries and not the contrary: the "native" population, both local and immigrant, developed methods and institutions to meet their own needs within the urban environment. Thence tribalism or eth- nicity are seen as an unceasing "contemporary sociocultural response to situational stimuli;" the importance of tribal affiliation arises in the context of contact and competition in the urban milieu. Besides, the concept of natives proves to be an absolutely inadequate label for so many varied migrants and changing patterns of migrations coming from quite dissimilar social and political groups identified as "ethnical ones" in the hinterland (pp.12-16). We can also emphasize that the settler population was a highly diversified body as well (pp. 39, 121-5). Conflict, both interethnic and intracommunal, played a significant role in the hardening of ethnic boundaries and the en- trenchment of the institution of headship. Groups unceasingly increased in size, segmented, and re-amalgamated. Since the 19th century, loyalty to individual leaders as well as their ambitions, largely based upon neighborhoods and labor gangs, were the foci of the shifting composition of the groups. Furthermore, candidates for headship were representatives of specific factions. The identifying role of Islam in the 19th century, then the colonial enforcement from informal recognition to an instituted headship in 1905, largely due to socioeconomic and political factors (p. 158), gave birth to an authori- tarian, dualistic political system and eventually to the hesitant policy of successive independent governments. These governments suppressed "tribes" in 1967 in order to reinstate headmen in 1975, and encouraged an even greater emphasis in urban areas on "ethnic 52</page><page sequence="53">The Process of Urbanization in Africa communities" (a particularly inappropriate title for "tribes," although, during the twentieth century, to be recognized as a tribe with a headman was a mark of status: 187 and 305). Therefore, once more, for political affairs as well as for social (or economic or cultural) ones, a critique of ethnicity is at the root of the more recent trends in urban anthropology; as Harrell, Howard and Skinner state, despite all the factors promoting ethnicity as the basis for categorical relationships, people interact in most situations where ethnicity is not a relevant variable (pp. 305-306). Early in its history Freetown has been considered a culturally plural society characterized by a high degree of economic interdependency. The problem is, as in almost every case, that colonial African cities suf- fered from the absence of formal municipal institutions which would be relevant to their experience and would facilitate their political local-level participation (p. 318). Curiously one political theme characteristic of contemporary Africa is still too little elaborated: urban riots. Case studies on urban resistance and policy are still unusual compared to the mass of resis- tance movements studied in the rural areas. However, since the Second World War the quasi-totality of successful putsches occurred- and more recently popular and/or youth uprisings exploded-in cities, even though civil wars are still often of rural essence (Congolese rebellions, Biafra war, Ethiopian irredentism). Indeed it is in the cities-place of power-that state power will express itself in a contradictory relationship between the building-up of modern clienteles and outbursts of popular rage (Cooper, 1983: 40). Few authors have studied this causal link between town, populism, military power, and unique party, and only briefly between town and state. Furedi was probably the first to do so for Nairobi (1973). The re-entry of Nairobi in the Mau-Mau rebellion, through the role of the urban working-class and unemployed, has been a relatively recent asser- tion (see Kanogo, 1987). It reminds us of the political connection between urban and rural political movements, which proves once more that a city never goes by itself alone. Richard Joseph insisted upon the significance of the riots in 1945 and 1955 in Douala, and on the antagonisms not only between settlers and Africans but also among native districts and social groups, old city-dwellers and new migrants (workers, underproletar- ians and outcasts, and landowners) in the genesis of UPC rebellion in Cameroon (1977). It had already been noted how the Douala notables, along with their European allies, had opposed the introduction of municipal self-government ("Commune de plein exercice") with a council elected by franchise rather than the previ- ous Council of Notables between 1944 and 1955, at a time when immi- gration into the city was rendering them a minority (Gardinier, 1969). A recent inventory of West African main successive urban riots since 1977 has been made (Wiseman, 1986). In the case of Nigeria, Lerche has investigated several hundreds of social strifes, most of 53</page><page sequence="54">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW them in cities, between 1971 and 1977 (1982). But the "Trois Glorieuses" at Brazzaville, where the mob, bursting out from the popu- lar districts, determined the acceleration of the union forces, originally prudent, and created in 1963 the conditions for the setting up of the Popular Republic of the Congo, has not yet produced a conclusive study. And recently the uprising of Soweto youths has generated informative analyses, while still incomplete in many respects, given the conditions of research.6 Most scholars suppose power and the state as given, as entities per se, and urbanites (like the rest of the civil society) are thought to have no other issue than to recognize the state and contest for its con- trol, or to struggle against it. Social scientists should realize rather that people and conflicts in the city may be as independent as in rural areas and equally indifferent to state power. Even if they do not resent the state and therefore ignore its power, they challenge its pre- rogatives, and they prevent it from becoming as autocratic as it usually claims to be. New social forces in the city exert the most orig- inal political actions precisely because they are not bound by formal political views, being accorded no recognized right to be political. This development is especially obvious today, with the outburst, everywhere in Africa, of so-called IMF riots, or riots in which sky- high food prices are the direct factor initiating protests, demonstra- tions and, finally, riots. Since the late 1970s, these movements, exacerbated by poverty and inflation, are reactions to state austerity policies implemented with the aim of solving the debt crisis at the behest of the International Monetary Fund (Walton, 1987). In a number of cases such uprisings take on a wider significance, resonating with popular political movements occurring at the same time. Is this phenomenon new? Similar events emerged during colonial times with actors who had never been previously recognized as true political participants, such as women and the so-called informal sector (see below). Labor and Women's Studies The themes of labor history and class formation, as well as the theme of gender relations, have been explored during the 1970s and early 1980s (in the case of the latter only). Bill Freund's overview paper covers the social ground for labor history and problems (1987). As a matter of fact, until recently, labor struggles have been investi- gated per se rather than in relation to the work place, though usually this was a city (an administrative one, a mining compound, a rail- way camp or station, an economic point like a harbor or a marketplace). Among many others, Peter Waterman's study (1982) on the trade unionism of Lagos dockers from the 1940s to the 1960s is typical of these monographs, where the place of work matters less than labor institutions seen through their organizational develop- ments. A favored method was to investigate the emergence, process, and techniques of such a social crisis as a strike. The analyzer is 54</page><page sequence="55">The Process of Urbanization in Africa less concerned by the nature of the place where this protest movement occurred (being a mine, a factory, or a railway) than by the strategy of conflict taken as a catalyst of proletarianization (Perrings, 1979; Van Onselen, 1977). Nearly nothing is said on where and how workers live and work. The shift came from Cooper's Struggle for the City which explicitly made the connection between labor and city. In his introduction he reviews the utility of successive Marxist theories--on dependency; on a structuralist articulation of Modes of Production; on "dependent urbanism;" on colonial planning and the colonial city, and the relationship between social process and city structure; on the city as a locus of reproduction of the working-class rather than a lo- cus of production, in spite of its role in the circulation of capital and in the general process of accumulation; and the interdependence between urban space and work (1983: 8-50). Thence, Van Onselen's New Babylon (1982) and Cooper's recent study of colonial Mombasa (1987) are major steps forward. Penvenne's work (1982) on Lourengo Marques (Maputo) must also be cited. Van Onselen did not focus on Johannesburg alone. But when dealing with the city, he chose to follow the evolution of specifically urban social groups (such as prostitutes, tramway and cab drivers, washermen, domestic servants) living in the town's working-class suburbs. He explains how, at the turn of the century, in the city where capitalism developed most powerfully (and with the closest links to a capitalist transformation of agriculture), capitalist devel- opment gave rise to a kind of urban bricolage as African groups found diverse niches in the city which they could construct in their own way. These clusters of workers concentrated in the boarding houses and mine compounds and reproduced and accentuated several elements of late 19th-century British male working-class culture, based on drinking and prostitution. Both were encouraged and con- trolled by the white powers, no matter how divided these might appear on the legislation on prohibition, prostitution, and delin- quency. The result was to widen the divorce from the broader influence of family life for thousands of miners, giving birth, as early as the turn of the century, to a specifically urban population and culture of poverty. Locating these groups within the emerging struc- tures of an industrial society and refracting their experiences through the process of class struggle, Van Onselen demonstrates these ordinary people in the making definitely have very little to do with any kind of rural traditionalism, even if they borrowed, shared, and adapted practices drawn from older settings: Their purpose was to put these borrowings to work in their new environment adapting them to the wider context of 19th-century industrial capitalism. Cooper develops the same idea apropos the 1930s, when Mombasa was, together with the Copperbelt, the main laboratory of social change in urban colonial Africa. It was a place where transition implied passage from a circulating labor migrancy to a 55</page><page sequence="56">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW stable urban working-class rooted in urban residence and an urban way of life. The labor problem, and thence the urban problem, was part of an imperial crisis, connected to a wider dynamic trend, a search for new political formulas to solve long-standing structural failures in colonial economies. This might be accompanied by a quest for other forms of urban solidarity, recreating and reinforcing older beliefs and ideological networks. In the case of Northern Nigeria, Lubeck (1986) explores the specific role Islam played in town for consolidating an emerging urban working-class consciousness. Studying the transformation of labor reintroduces the need to focus on privileged moments and places of acceleration in the evolution, because change was seldom a peaceful and harmonious concept. Change implies rupture as well as continuity. A periodization of urban colonization was not a major preoccupation of the social an- thropology of change. It was usually understated, all the more so because the stress was put on the more recent process of urbanization (from the 1950s onward). In reaction to this, labor and economic history reintroduced the idea of an urban rupture, the turning point chosen being either the turn of the century (Van Onselen) or the late 1930s and 1940s (Fred Cooper), or even the 1950s or later (Gutkind, Cohen, and Copans, 1978). These are clearly works that study the emergence of urban social classes from economic transformations and which perceive the political framework of the city as reflecting both the growing impact of the world-wide capitalist system and the specific forms of the colonial (national) state. (On some synthesizing comments and relatively innovative formulas in relating African ci- ties to the world economy, see Rayfield, 1974.) This appears to be a historical version of Marxist theory, rupture being the privileged moment when major social contradictions have to be resolved through quickening social change; but privileged turning points of rupture are many, and are neither the same nor situated at the same moment according to various authors and varied situations. They are the outcome not only of the stage of capitalism in the core of the sys- tem, but depend as well on the correlated stages of capitalism both in the mother country and its dependents. The study of women in town demonstrates a similar evolution. The first comprehensive survey was proposed by Kenneth Little (1973), remarkable if one thinks of how few case studies on the topic existed at the time. More recently through fifteen biographies of urban women, Raymond Deniel delivered a similar but even more pes- simistic message (1985). Though a little too generalized, these studies stressed the ambiguity of the position of women in the modern town, a place par excellence for studying changes in women's status. Women are seen as migrants, as producers in the urban economy, where many of them are educationally disadvantaged, and are hence prime prey for the informal sector, including trade or prostitu- tion.7 But women also acquire a privileged place in politics (possibly through their voluntary associations) and in social mobility through 56</page><page sequence="57">The Process of Urbanization in Africa new opportunities for love, marriage, and matrimonial partnership, even if their social conservatism may also be accentuated by the novelty and difficulties of urban life. Ten years ago Margaret Strobel's work on Muslim women in Mombasa introduced more specific relations between urban women, change, and the city, and for the first time developed the idea proper of a history of the question (1979). Other engaging social essays in- clude the one by Kristin Mann on the evolution of marriage among Lagos' urban upper middle-class (1985); one by Barbara Callaway on the reinforcement of Muslim constraints on women in Kano where confinement appears in popular spheres (1987); and very differently, the one by Jacklyn Cock on the rigors of domestic conditions in Grahamstown (1980). But most studies analyze recent changes in conditions for women (in their productive and reproductive role) in rural areas; few are on urban women. There is a very rich set of life histories collected on women (many of which are cited in Allen Isaacman's overview paper on Peasant and Rural Social Protest, 1989), some of which deal at least partly with urban life and experience (Geiger, 1987). Only Bujra (1975) and White (1983) have thus far focused on a specific female urban group: prostitutes in Nairobi. Luise White points out how women specialized in a supposedly informal, hence illegal, activity. They knew how to organize and coalesce in an emerging, therefore threatening, class that dared to establish an official relationship with recognized groups such as the petty bourgeoisie or working-class. White explores the complex position of women in the patterns of social reproduction and change and asks how women's role in the illegal economy is related to the gender biases of the legal economy (Cooper, 1983: 42-43). Is it progress or once again marginal- ization? Veena Thadani asks the question (1978-79). The theme of female revolts also begins to be studied. With certain exceptions (for example, Aba revolt in 1925 in Yorubaland), it is generally in town that women achieved consciousness of their political weight; it is also in town that they can express their bitterness against the symbols of colonial oppression-native courts, banks, warehouses, jails. In the great coastal cities of western Africa, their eminent eco- nomic position in retail activities (Yoruba women: 1929 riots) or even wholesale trade (on fabric dealers at Lomb in Togo, see Aduayom, 1984) induced them to react with an esprit de corps against the colonial constraints which bore directly upon them. They took over their imprisoned men's activities (Diabate, 1975 on "La marche de Grand Bassam" in 1947 in Ivory Coast). In South Africa, women have been involved in 20th-century political struggles, although their role changed vis-a-vis the developing capitalist economy of urban South Africa during the period of the 1920s thru 1960s. They progressively adapted attrition and resistance strategies which have now begun to be studied (Walker, 1982). This is still principally part of women's studies rather than of urban studies. 57</page><page sequence="58">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW Poverty, the Household, and the Informal Sector Curiously, poverty was recently rediscovered in urban Africa; of course, it was not previously unknown. In the 1939 report on nutri- tion in the British Empire, there are some comments about urban malnutrition. A sudden growth of studies of nutrition and social welfare from the late 1930s onward stressed poverty in Mombasa (Kenya) and would be worth studying (Cooper, 1987: 65). Clarkson investigated the problem of begging and destitution in urban areas of the Gold Coast (1956). But the question of urban social welfare policy and practice re-emerged only recently (see Seeley 1987 on Kenya). The renewal comes from the flourishing literature on the so-called in- formal sector, which began as an economic concept, and then was partially transformed into a social and spatial one, especially in the francophone literature (Debl and Hugon, 1982; Stren, 1986). It was examined in the town setting by Sandbrook (1982). The key question may be summarized as follows: Is capitalism, seen as a universalis- tic system of property and social relations, contradictorily generating different forms of anarchy of the market, with unassimilable classes dangereuses (in industrializing societies), ghetto people, informal people (in underdeveloped countries), or new poor (in developed ones)? Did the rise of these social groups accompany the transition to capitalism? Or, on the contrary, was capitalism largely predated by poverty and its techniques of survival? The recent achievement of Africanist research is to prove that the phenomenon is not only economical, but social, that it is not new, but rooted in history. Once again, it was Gutkind who introduced the topic (1962). Recently Iliffe brilliantly re-examined and developed it through history (1987). Poverty was not created by capitalism, but cap- italism transformed its nature and dimensions. From the 16th century in Ethiopia, Iliffe shows how poor people of the precolonial (preindustrial) type-the handicapped, the sick, the old, and women, to whom we must add periodically the victims of conjunctural crises (ecological or military)-had the tendency to gather in quite visible centers: near monasteries, at pilgrimage centers, and in the imperial capital city. In western Africa impoverished grassland cultivators tended even more to look for refuge in the city, as the poor in Ethiopia rushed into monasteries in times of calamity. The proliferation of small and middle towns in some Western Sudanese regions (Hausaland and Yorubaland, coast of Togo and southern Dahomey) seems to have offered the poor better opportunities to survive than anywhere else. Nineteenth century sources reveal for Jenne, as well as for Kano, all sorts of petty urban businesses--crafts, street retail trade, firewood, water, and food supply-all of which allow us to presume the precocious emergence of a marginal sector, today defined as informal. Small towns in the savanna were the locus of urban social stratification with distinctions between rich and poor. The poor had no other way to survive but by dependency and slavery or perhaps by individual techniques of independent survival possible 58</page><page sequence="59">The Process of Urbanization in Africa only in cities. During the colonial period the same phenomenon occurred with the entry into wage labor in the service of whites. Therefore, the informal sector is not a new reality, but as a residen- tial and professional social category, it was produced as soon as Western capitalism entered Africa. It comes from all those who were not allowed entry to the official urban market of labor, because they were not directly useful as producers or auxiliaries serving the dependent order. They were not supposed to have a natural right to become urban dwellers. Legally (when segregation was installed) or implicitly, they were tolerated only (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988). Iliffe points out that it is, of course, in South Africa that we can have the earliest and clearest view because of the exceptional advancement of Western capitalism in this region. The growth in the numbers of the poor was attributable to the passage of a situation of individual poverty with land to a situation of familial poverty with- out land, with a relative inversion of the labor force from a situation of scarcity to a state of overpopulation. Of course, the phenomenon was not unknown earlier; since the 18th century Kho'i people were deprived of their properties, and around 1830 Cape Town knew familial misery of underpaid and jobless proletarians. The process was not yet completed by the middle of the 20th century, when most poor people without possessions but in good health could still, except in exceptional unemployment crises, find a job to survive (as shown in Van Onselen, 1982). In the meantime, poverty was increasingly lo- cated among black and colored people who became increasingly marginalized by both apartheid and modernity. More and more able- bodied men could no longer find work because there was none for them. To belong to a large family definitely became an additional factor of poverty instead of representing, as before, a potential for wealth. If towns scarcely engendered poverty (contrary to the belief of colonizers who considered poverty an urban problem), they gave poverty new forms. In town the African poor had to learn all sorts of new realities: shantytown promiscuity, the exhausting and enner- vating effects of heavy labor, hunger in the midst of the wealthy, western-style prostitution, death far from the ancestors, the humiliation of unemployement, the discovery that kinship hospital- ity was not inexhaustible. The Yoruba urban environment, and particularly Lagos, constitutes an extraordinary documentary source for the end of the 19th century (see Gale, 1979). Also, the rereading, in terms of poverty, of an abundant anthropological, economic or town- planning literature on the migrants' ways of life and on so-called informal activities enables us to ask questions in new ways. On the example of Mombasa, Cooper illuminates the anteriority of this recently discovered informal sector, which long existed and was known to the British as "living off one's wits" (1987: 181). Not only is it worthwhile to uncover the historical roots of the phe- nomenon, but it is also valuable to comment upon the ideological 59</page><page sequence="60">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW significance of this particular label: informal. It underlines the Western tendency to put out-of-bounds all the economic activities which could not be strictly labeled as modern. It is not by chance that the concept appeared at the very beginning of the 1970s, at a moment when industrialization and modernization were still offered as the unique hope for development. Connected with the idea of the anteriority, and also the universality, of the informal sector, the concept of household has been recently investigated in several seminal works (Guyer and Peters, 1987; Martin and Beittel, 1987). This makes necessary not only a re- thinking of concepts used in Africa, but also a reexamination of an explicitly or implicitly supposed African specificity (based on ethnicity) which is highly questionable. A reevaluation of African households is an occasion for conceptualizing the ordinariness of African societies, that is, assuming that they were and are similar in their functioning to any other society in the world (and, first of all, to Western societies). Recent research on South Africa, described by Martin and Beittel (1987), is a good example of what can be done. They point out the universality of the coexistence, for any household subsistence, of wage and non-wage labor (that is, depending on capi- talist and informal sectors). Wages, even in the core citadels of the world economy, generally fail to cover the total costs of reproduction of the labor force; non-wage labor is not a specificity of the informal sphere of the periphery. Consequently, non-wage labor production processes are not to be seen as a mere subsidiary of the development of wage labor in core areas. The dual economy view returns again and again to the well- known version of traditional versus modern sectors of productive economy. Conversely, to look at the family, household, or domestic unit as one of the basic institutions of mankind and therefore, be- cause of its universality, as a main tool of the capitalist world economy, is certainly not to imply it is the same everywhere. Differentiations arise from history and culture, the global division of labor demarcating interdependent yet differentiated zones of economic activity, characterized by the existence of very different labor force structures. This implies a definition of the concept of household different in nature from mere co-resident dwelling groups based on kin struc- tures. For example, it is absurd to look at households as harmonious units whose conflicts or struggles were erased by kinship. An African household is also a place of contradictions, especially because, as elsewhere, it is the focus of gender contradictions, and of gendered struggles around women's work for incomes. As in Asia (or even in Europe), most women are dependent on men's networks or their rela- tionships to individual men for access to reasonably paid work in both the registered firms and in most of the informal sector, or they are dependent on their male relatives' networks (Thornbek, 1988). What distinguishes households' patterns is not so much the forms of 60</page><page sequence="61">The Process of Urbanization in Africa income but rather the structure and evolution of interconnections between these forms, each type being in relationship to and against the others.8 The structure and history of African households, and especially of poor households, may indicate the complex evolution of strategies of survival from ancient times to modern capitalism, be- cause of the varied forms of labor (proletarian and informal ones) through the colonization process. Colonizers had already decided the issue as a consequence of their full capitalist money market credo. They rejected any idea other than a well-organized and strictly defined labor force. Their aim was to struggle against informality by building a kind of well- ordered and hard-working city. It is not by chance that housing be- came one of the main causes of labor unrest from 1939 onwards. Most interesting is the development on Mombasa at the end of the 1930s ex- plaining how the improvement of the working-class condition implied the remodeling of their urban space (Cooper, 1987: 181). Housing was at the core of the process. State intervention in the location and quality of housing was required to organize a "permanent urban native community with its own institutions and its own sense of responsibility and communal pride" (p. 176). The colonial state was just as ambivalent about housing as it was about the previous gangs of migrant casual workers; African housing was cheaper and, for the officials, effortless, even if it was seen as dan- gerous. Though in Mombasa it was a priority, through the programs of the government planned housing estate and also the idea of promoting home ownership among Africans, to favor an emerging stable urban middle-class, issues arose such as scarcity, low quality, overcrowding, and high rental prices. The main obstacle was to wean dockers from the "African's tribal way of life," albeit that this would at the same time leave them more anonymous and isolated than before, isolated from their complex web of social relations and culture connections of the casual worker workplace, urban resi- dence, and farms (Cooper, 1987). Therefore, connected with poverty, there is a renewed interest in social conditions of housing and areas of residential segregation in tropical Africa as well as, of course, in South Africa. Urbanism and the Built Environment French and francophone urban geographers have produced over the last thirty years an impressive series of case studies on African cities which today represent major historical sources, and which are unparalleled in the anglophone literature. Many monographs have been published as articles in Cahiers d'Outre-Mer, while one of the first books was Lasserre's Libreville (1958). Among the best of such works are Assane Seck's Dakar (1970) and Alfred Mondjannagni's Towns of Southern Dahomey (1977), and, more recently, Kinshasa by Mare Pain (1984) and Rend de Maximy (1984), Yaoundi by Franqueville (1984), and Douala by Mainet (1985). Also worth noting 61</page><page sequence="62">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW are Savonnet's Thies (1955), Villien-Rossi's Bamako (1966), Vennetier's Pointe-Noire (1968), Champaud's Cities of Western Cameroon (1983), and Sirven's Cities of Rwanda and Burundi (1984). Essentially unconcerned with social change (with the exception of Douala.: Ville et Histoire by Gouellain), these works serve primarily to describe with consider- able precision the origin, site, location, functions, and historical expansion of the city, including population growth (migrancy and demographic rates), processes of ownership, and progressive building of new districts and suburbs, with an impressive number of evoca- tive and evolutive maps. Beyond the enormous amount and extensive treatment of data, however, one finds a general lack of conceptual analysis: Research priorities and main issues are not defined as such, and conclusions remain descriptive. As Jane Guyer states on French scholarship in human geography, there is a "frustrating lack ... in redefining the central issues" (1987: 16). The genre has no true equivalent in anglophone literature, except perhaps a short monograph written long ago on Kano, which is now an historical source (Whittlesey, 1937), and John Maud's City Government on Johannesburg (1936). Aside from these, we may refer to Gutkind's Kibuga (1963) and, more recently, colonial Salisbury by Kay and Smout (1977), and Lusaka and its Environs by Williams (1986). Particularly interesting is Andrew Hake's Nairobi (1977), half of which deals with the history of housing and regulations by the city council, the other half with the expansion and life in the self- help city generated within the modern city, which reportedly was "building more houses, creating more jobs, absorbing more people, and growing faster than the modern city." French scholarship on the subject gained new impetus and depth in the 1970s, when the Office pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre Mer (ORSTOM) launched a large multidisciplinary research effort on processes of urbanization in Africa. On the whole these works were not historical (barring Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988; and Cahen, 1989); geographers, urban planners, architects, anthropol- ogists, economists, and political scientists emphasized contemporary or recent aspects of material life: housing, transport, and food supply. The impetus for such work continued in the 1980s largely by the initiative of REXCOOP, an experimental instrument for financing ap- plied research. This interministry office (which closed down in 1987) was responsible for publishing a series from L'Harmattan entitled "Villes et Entreprises." The substantive conclusions in these works are almost always provocative, critical of generalization, and full of interesting information. The conceptual framework hesitates more between the sheer variety of African situations and a skepti- cism about the Anglo-Saxon tendency to stick to a more coherent but overly particular theoretical vision. Nevertheless a trend emerges which is more explicitly comparative, more integrative of research and policy, and more conscious of the ideological implications of research frameworks. 62</page><page sequence="63">The Process of Urbanization in Africa A few town planning and architecture studies have emerged. On precolonial urban design, Hull (1976) proposed a survey. Though he retains a somewhat traditional view of the precolonial African town as "both a macrocosm of the small family compound and a mi- crocosm of the kingdom itself" (p. 399), he understands it as minimizing urbanity but maximizing urban space: minispace was dispersed (scattered places) while large plots of maxispace were found at the center (palace parade ground and market-place). Despite low densities, urban development was concentrated and such spatial intimacy lent a feeling of cohesiveness: "Because of this delicate bal- ance between mass and space, traditional towns were able to achieve a vital neutrality between urbanity and rurality" (p. 405). Islamic urban architecture has certainly been the most studied. Garlake was innovative, connecting Swahili city planning with the global social and political organization. He argues that the remark- able planning of all domestic buildings may be explained through two main convergent yet contrasted causes: the first being that all land and buildings were vested in a single powerful authority, the Sultan or Sheikh, whose agents watched in detail how a complex of buildings should be planned, though it is most unlikely that such an authority extended to the details of all urban housing. Nevertheless, cooperation is obvious between individual homeowners. All adjoin- ing houses share a single common party wall; the plans of adjoining houses and also the courts (the same court often serving three separate houses) interlock rather than simply abut one another. Such an arrangement entails joint planning from the start and requires simultaneous building of entire blocks. It implies a close identity of interests, which most probably sprang from a close degree of kinship, or very firm tribal ties. Perhaps one single group or family did not build an entire town. But, certainly, such a group controlled blocks of several separate houses built together. At least it was the case for the sphere of stone-built housing, concerning the upper classes, if not for the temporary timber and earth dwellings of the bulk of the popula- tion (Garlake, 1966: 89-90). Similarly, in the case of both Sudan and French Western Africa, Winters (1977, 1982) explained how Islamic urban architecture proved a high degree of town-planning concenta- tion, in short, the existence of an urbanistic project. However, the same appears to be true in the rain-forest belt, such as in traditional Asante architecture, probably infiltrated by magico-religious aspects of Islam. Although Labelle Prussin (Moni Adams, Labelle Prussin et al., 1980) does not work specifically on ur- ban architecture and has a tendency to focus on singular houses or buildings rather than on urbanism proper, most of her examples are obviously drawn from Kumasi or more coastal towns. She insists on the political nature of the Asante style, the architecture of the capital city being reproduced in key regional capitals, standing in contrast to the basic unadorned forms, with, as Louis Binger describes, facades "ornamented with pillars and with designs in hollows molded on 63</page><page sequence="64">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW the lianes of bamboo, disposed in arcs, circles, triangles, lozenges, etc" (1892). This urban architecture, illustrated by the completion of the Osei Bonsu palace in 1820-1822, was an integral expression of Asante political cohesion. In most precolonial cities, urbanism was understood as being mainly a state affair. Only recently has it been realized that the way the built environment was produced is not only a consequence of cultural heritage. The cultural environment and heritage were usually treated as independent variables to explain architecture, the cultural milieu being taken for granted en amont, resulting in architectural forms. (Take for example the notion among English people that each family needs a garden and an individual dwelling divided into different types of rooms [King, 1984b: 99]; or, for a Yoruba urban household, that the requirement is a square or rectangular compound enclosing a common central area [Cameiro da Cunha, 1985: 58].) Cultural expla- nation is another route back to the classical dichotomy "tradition versus modernity" without referring to what models of society it actually addresses. Building forms rely mainly on technological and economical, but on social, political, and, of course, cultural determi- nants as well. Some of the best work on this topic has been done by King, whose 1984 articles, "The Social Production of Building Forms," and "Colonial Architecture Re-visited," proposed historical and criti- cal surveys of previous theoretical essays on the question and uncovered a multiplicy of new approaches on the question. The other, more sophisticated, approach (elaborated in King, 1984b: 99) is to work from the assumption that "how people build af- fects how people think" rather than the converse that "how people think governs how people build." In other words, not only does the built environment have a function, a purpose, and a meaning, but also urban planning and architectural design exert a central influ- ence in maintaining and reproducing the global society, and perhaps still more for inducing processes of social and political change. In contrast to the culturalist approach, which tends to be static, paying too little attention to the dynamics of social and cultural change, a few recent studies attempt to understand the evolution of housing as evidence of a change in societal arrangements. As fasci- nating as they are, most architectural studies focusing on history have a tendency to describe the housing design as a cumulative result of the past, expressing a convergence between ecological conditions, technological abilities, and a political and ideological environment and heritage (Denyer, 1978; Prussin, 1986; Bah, 1985). In the case of Portuguese architecture, it has been studied by some monographs centered on the European influence in building trading posts and castles (on Ouidah, see Berbain, 1942; and Agbo, 1959; on Elmina, Ballong-Wen-Mewuda, 1984; on Ajuda, Lopes, 1939; on trade castles and forts, Lawrence, 1963; Van Danzig and Pridy, 1971). Of course the evolution of housing influenced coastal urban design from the 16th century. It was, however, seen primarily as a state affair. 64</page><page sequence="65">The Process of Urbanization in Africa On the opposite side, only Kea (1982) integrated the Gold Coast urban network into the regional, interregional, and world economic system of the 17th century. Little was written from the point of view of Africans before Cameiro da Cunha and Verger (1985) which focuses on the Brazilian house or sobrado in Nigeria and Dahomey and the Indian-English bungalow (King, 1984). In both cases, the question is to know how and why people converted easily enough to a separate and free-standing form of dwelling, usually of one storey and with many windows, and more or less located on its own plot. The answer may have been the adaptability, both of previous architecture and of the people, demonstrating an innovative Yoruba component of the city. Cameiro and Verger explain that the basic dwelling of a Yoruba family had a similar structure based on the same core spatial organization. The rapid diffusion of the Brazilian model out of the Afro-Brazilian society proper (it now probably covers 90 percent of Yorubaland housing) came from the similarity of the spatial distribution and a common use of a veranda. This is not entirely convincing: to live on a large compound, comprising the aggregation of several scattered units of accomodation, is different from accommodating the whole family under the same roof, even if the family inhabits a large mansion and maintains a space dedicated to common activities. Nevertheless, the authors' assertion is suggestive in explaining why earlier architecture and households were open to technical (new materials, opening of windows, special- ized rooms) as well as social improvements. Housing and furniture were produced by a group of masons, bricklayers, carpenters, and other skilled manual workers, most of them former slaves trained in Brazil, who trained in turn a large number of apprentices who spread all over the country. A common hierarchical principle com- manded the spatial distribution, albeit based on different sociopolitical systems. In Brazil, it rested on the opposition between slaves (on the ground floor) and masters, whereas in Africa it depended upon relative age, wealth, and political power. The "Brazilians" were thus emphasizing their authority, status and prestige by adopting the way and place of life (first floor) of their former masters in Brazil. Housing reflected social stratification, all the more so as the Brazilians used their houses not only to live in, but also as an investment and for rental, especially in Dahomey where access to arable land was forbidden to them. Therefore housing was not only an affair of the state and the king. It was also a private affair, concerning an emerging and growing upper middle-class of merchants and other big men in the city, and later, popular housing as well. A similar analysis may be done for the British bungalow, "probably the only type of dwelling which, in both name and form, exists in every continent" (King, 1984a: 432). King, unaware of the Afro-brazilian heritage, perhaps exaggerates when he points out the exclusiveness of the British bungalow model and the role of Lugard 65</page><page sequence="66">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW in Nigeria. (Nevertheless he may be right if the Brazilian architec- tural model itself derived, at least partly, not only from the Portuguese heritage but also from the British pervasive influence, Britain having invested a lot in Brazil as early as the 18th century.) In the suburb created for British officials during Lugard's administra- tion in Kano, houses were a more spacious and luxurious version of Hausa urban domestic forms: single storey, high ceilings, thick mud walls, plastered on inside and out, no veranda, small slit-like windows, flat roofs ornamented with balustrades. They were cool in the daytime and warm at night. (Unfortunately by 1960 they were, like elsewhere, in the process of being replaced by the concrete stan- dardized houses which were wholly inappropriate to the climate.) Thus British colonial influence, which prevailed in northern Nigeria, met with the Brazilian model of African coastal housing. The latter prepared and reinforced the accelerated impact of the former. Both were part of a new socialization of space connected with the early rise of European capitalism. African people dynamically adapted to the transformation of space usage, including the socialization of rooms and changes in the household form. The basic question is the transformation of material culture, particularly domestic space and buildings, testifying to various aspects of the transition from a subsistence economy to capitalism. As for the Brazilian bungalow, obviously the so-called triangular com- merce based on slave trade and colonialism developed complex intercontinental relations and a global system of exchange which included building techniques and, more generally, mercantilism (Gubler, "Archetecture and Colonialism, 1980). The generalization of the bungalow also lies in the emergence and universalization of industrial capitalism, because physical and spatial forms of housing are produced by the global system of eco- nomic and political organization. It followed the processes of capital- ist industrialization from India (18th century), transferred to Africa through colonialism. King rightly stresses that the global answer has been "modernization," or "bourgeoisification" (1984a: 436), but, that said, it explains nothing. One has to concretely analyze the varied effects of a developing market economy, foreign trade, land revenue and rental on urban growth, the emergence of a new bourgeoisie, and housing. All this is revealing of changes in consciousness, ideology, social relations, and class structures. The fact is that most syntheses (enumerated by King, 1984a: 435) have barely dealt with the topic, and most of them are limited to Western housing evolution, except Schwerdtfeger who concludes his study of African housing by describing the gradual decline of traditional forms in favor of the Western nuclear model of family and lodging (1982: 312). Hence we realize the importance of King's study of the colonial city as a special moment in the evolution of African conceptions of housing and city planning. Is the increase in the amount of new urban housing to be related to the extent of economic development? 66</page><page sequence="67">The Process of Urbanization in Africa Economists have undertaken to relate per capita income in various societies to the proportion of households in different forms of tenure (such as public and private renting, owner occupation). Obviously this is insufficient: other geographical, historical, and cultural variables intervene. King insists on the importance of situational explanations for varied developments in the built environment (1984a). This statement is reinforced by the cross-cultural historical study of the bungalow, which was adopted everywhere, but each time in a different way. To which place must we attribute colonial urban- ism in this evolution of built forms? As King asserts, it is a common misconception to suggest that colonial societies merely reproduced the kind of society, including colonial architecture and planning, which colonists had at home (1984b: 103). Nowhere in London, Brussels, or Paris can be found, for example, a bungalow and compound, or a "concession" of the kind and dimensions as exist in Nairobi, Kinshasa, or Brazzaville, not least for the reason that most residential schemes were on a much larger scale (King, 1984b: 103). Unfortunately, precise case studies deal with India (King, 1976), or Morocco, Madagascar, and Indochina (Wright, 1987) rather than with Africa south of the Sahara. To date, except Kipre's Villes coloniales de CMte dIvoire and Doutreuwe- Salvaing's Architecture coloniale en CMte d'Ivoire (1985), we have, at best, shorter or not yet published case studies on Dakar (Betts, "Dakar, Ville imperiale 1857-1960"), or Cape Town (Ross, "Cape Town 1850- 1950" -both in Ross and Telkamp, 1985) or Nigerian cities (Home, 1983). Nevertheless, many of their theoretical proposals remain valid for cross-cultural analysis. A first common point appears to be either French or English periodization for colonial urbanism. This periodization went along a similar path to the changes in other related discourses, such as health and labor. (Studied, for example, by K.D. Patterson and Fred Cooper.) A former phase of direct intervention (said "assimilation" in francophonic imperialism) expressed a will for direct demonstration of force through destruction or neglect of indigenous towns. (See, for example, Gale on Lagos, 1979.) Along with a will for a visible military presence went an assertion of political and cultural supremacy, with no concession to the culture of the subordinate society, embodied by an unambiguously classical style of monumen- tal colonial architecture (Wright, 1987: 298-299; King, 1984b: 101). Thence a monumental conception of administrative and political buildings (government houses, courts, residences) and also an explicit desire for a "reorientation of the space economy": wharves, docks, warehouses, customs houses, banks, factories, etc. (Mabogunje, 1980). In both cases, while city planning continued to emphasize the gap between African city dwellers and a dominant class coming from a foreign culture, obeying distinctive social and cultural requirements, this later took the form of what the French entitled an 67</page><page sequence="68">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW "association" policy, paying more attention to local cultural sensibili- ties in architectural design. Proclaimed issues of historic preservation and building style were also useful for saving money in the name and under the pretext of respect for distinctive native cultures (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1988). As Wright proposes, urban design "assumed a major role in efforts to make colonialism more popular among Europeans and more tolerable to colonized people," pretending to modernize while simultaneously protecting tradition so as to stabilize the African urban population (1987: 292). Thus cultural themes were used to solve political problems, giving urban planning and architectural design a central importance to strengthen colonial power. Both authors assume that the second phase of urban colonialism played a major role for socialization, that is, induction of the indige- nous population into new forms of knowledge and acceptance of new models of housing, urban space, and jobs. A privileged narrow upper middle-class-the future governing elite-themselves assimilated these buildings (such as schools, hospitals, factories), public services (electricity, water supply) and modern building techniques, based on an imported technology and energy (King, 1984b: 102). In all cases, colonial urbanism was based on an authoritarian city planning which emerged as such in Subsaharan Africa from the 1920s or 1930s and exploded in its colonial structures from the 1950s. (See for example Heisler, 1971, 1974; Lilly, 1982; Collins, 1969, 1975, 1980; Van Zwanenberg, 1972; Weisner, 1976; Kobiah 1984-1985; Betts 1968, 1971; and Sinou 1985.) The concept of colonial cities as urban laboratories is important in terms of urban theory, legislation, and actual policies (Wright, 1987: 295-297). Colonial cities were used as experimental fields, to try and improve urban models born in Europe from European professionals combining modernism in architecture with an idea for integrating cultural phenomena into social and political history. This was as true for England as for France. The British theory on garden cities was born in England at the end of the 19th century as a solution for the contradiction opposing growing industrial cities to the countryside, expressive of an implicit envi- ronmental determinism which pursued physicalist solutions to social, economic, and political problems. The garden-city idea also expanded in France and Belgium. Realizations of it were found with extraordinary uniformity from Dakar to Elisabethville (Lubumbashi). Unaware of a totally different historical, economic, and cultural experience in African cities, where industrial capitalism was nonexistent or primarily depen- dent, urbanists went hand in hand with nascent social scientists, blinded by their Eurocentric outlook, and also colonial officials, who provided locally an unusual authority enabling several prominent architects and urbanists to carry out plans which they simply could not try in Europe. Both were ready to combine culture and politics to test their theories about a controlled economy, social structure, and 68</page><page sequence="69">The Process of Urbanization in Africa residential environment. But as Collins (1969) and Williams (1986) confirm, the result was but a myth. Especially visible in colonial cities, modern urbanism not only maintained but accentuated the gap between an emerging bourgeoisie and the bulk of urban people, abandoned to their precarious self-help shelters. (See, for example, Hake, 1977.) The urban spatial hierarchy was reinforced either by official segregation or by pseudo-spatial health regulations (the "sanitation syndrome"), which structured values through daily life (Swanson, 1977; Curtin, 1985; Call, 1986; Frenkal and Western, 1988). The classification of housing and jobs was "reflected in the classification of places and spaces and vice- versa" (King, 1984b: 103). This was due to colonial regulations, which themselves reflected the exigencies of the global export economy (brought about by, among other things, the expansion and penetration of international capital). Thence a growing centralization of economic activities within a number of big city metropolises, or "primate cities" (Roberts, 1978). A serious consequence of this type of centralization was a trend towards growing ecological segregation within the city itself (Walton, 1982). Dwellings (especially those of the poor) and small-scale productive activites were driven out of the city centers to make room for a concentration of commercial and administrative activities, with the actions of the state being of great significance. New industrial enclaves and the dwellings of the rich were increasingly localized in areas with better transport facilities and general services. At the same time the periphery of the city was swollen by housing areas for workers and the poor (including slums and shantytowns) with inferior public services, and by the localiza- tion of small scale production (often of an informal nature) in the outskirts of the city (Datta, 1989: 8-9). Therefore, from the very beginning, a dualism separated two forms of urban planning: on one side the European town, the only one to be truly recognized; on the other, the uncontrolled African settlements which swelled hand in hand with the emergence of marginal activities. This uncontrolled part of the city was not accepted as urban, the pretext being it looked more like rural areas than like a "true" (read "European") city. The truth is that, from the beginning, it was left, or rather abandoned, to African initiative. Control was minimal. When it first appeared, it took the negative form of coercive destruction (the well-known deguerpissement of French colonization). The process has been studied recently on cases of colonial Nairobi (Van Zwanenberg, 1972) and Lusaka, which was made of rural migrations (Heisler, 1971; Tipple, 1981; Rakodi, 1986). They proved that so-called spontaneous settlements, which would be better referred to as those not controlled by some kind of official power (being a colonial, state or municipal one) did not originate in the post-colonial mushrooming cities of today. They were from the beginning a structural part of colonial realities. Moreover, they were partly inherited from precolonial urban realities, insofar as a 69</page><page sequence="70">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW mercantile economy expanded through transitional dependent capitalism. (Besides Iliffe, however, this remains to be studied.) Nowadays, shantytowns and slums of the Third World have become increasingly large and extensive with the accelerated rhythm of African population boom and urban migration. But they were known beforehand, then even promoted by the urban colonial policy since its inception, being looked at as an unavoidable evil of a supposed tradi- tional way of life. The present literature on the topic is enormous, but this later stage goes beyond the limits of this paper. A Special Case: South African City Planning The ultimate stage of this situation is South Africa. Bibliography on urban South Africa is not yet so abundant (less than 40 titles out of 700) in spite of several early prominent studies (such as Wilson, 1963; or Mayer, 1963) and some brilliant recent ones. Urban history is presently quite productive, but unfortunately works in progress are not easily available abroad. The University of Witwatersrand History Workshop Conferences (there have been four of these) have for the most part been about urban social history, and many papers have been subsequently published. Cape Town too has produced four volumes of papers on Cape Town history (also proceedings of a conference). In the past, however, in spite of the quality of some works, analyses on cities have been biased there by influential prejudices. The first was a kind of a deviation of Marxist theory with the idea that "race differences and economic differences tend to coincide," the ecological distribution of races being "a distribution of income groups," and darker skin usually being associated with lower socioe- conomic status (Kuper, Watts and Davies on Durban, 1958: 136, 213). Therefore, for white nationalists, there would be a necessary coinci- dence between pigment, economic status, and space, resulting from the market mechanism as if by an ordained plan, producing a pattern of de facto residential segregation. Several studies point out the distortion between apartheid and growing conflicts emerging from the economic contradictions born from residential segregation. They also integrate theoretical reflec- tion with a precise spatial research. (One of the first was Swanson, "The Sanitation Syndrome," 1977; see also Hindson, 1985; Swilling, 1985; and Western, 1982). The merit of Western's work is to remind us that Cape Town was defined, to a far greater extent than any other town in South Africa, by a continuum of space-that is, extensive areas of residential mixing-but that the legal enactment of residen- tial segregation had already started in 1890. Of course white settlers purchased their residential segregation, the main geographical factors involved being aloofness from industry and proximity to amenities. But they also aimed at segregation not for itself but for domination through segregation (Western, 1982). 70</page><page sequence="71">The Process of Urbanization in Africa This goal caused the white ruling class to try and limit newly emerging black social orders born from capitalism and from the Africans' ability to construct, on their livelihoods, a semi-autonomy of their own threatening to the power structures. The whites' answer was to rationalize-to control-this labor market through urban planning used as a weapon for apartheid. Blacks were definitely expelled from the white city after 1945. An "ideal Apartheid city" was conceived and not far from being realized through the Group Areas theory and plans. Justification came from the friction theory which sought to prove that segregation is in the interest of all, because any contact between races inevitably produces conflict. This soon gave rise to a sense of obligation among scholars to devote time for evaluat- ing the truth of such issues. All literature inspired by the garden-city theory which had influenced the colonists, insistent upon the inclusion of vegetation in their cities (the preferable housing being the separate house in a garden on a straight, green-lined street) was equally biased by the same prerequisites: that the city center must remain in white hands; that residential areas had to be zoned; and, therefore, that squatting was evil, and slum-clearance a white duty (see Maud, 1936). Nevertheless, Hindson recently demonstrated that racial spatial ordering becomes economically and socially less and less appropri- ate, even for the whites' purposes (1985). Conclusion: Directions of Further Research From independence, the modification of urban standards is not just a matter of "changing architecture." It also claims to change life- styles, consumption habits, and ultimately the direction of the global economical and political values which no longer meet the require- ments of present dependent Africa. Contradictions between the acceptance of an ex-colonial and largely out-of-date model by an autochtonous privileged minority and the accusing misery of the rest of city-dwellers obliged to cover enormous distances on foot or cart have become unbearable. These are exacerbated by the disproportion- ate scale of low residential densities resulting from large ritual spaces made to impress rulers and ruled, combined with the huge compounds of officials and (ex)European settlers (King, 1984b: 103). The colonial power and the capitalist system were given as prevaling constraints determining an urban structural process resulting in social change. (Therein probably lies, as it appears from the present literature, the main difference between colonial and precolonial cities.) But colonial urbanism is no longer adapted to most modern political and economic issues. The analysis now stresses the simultaneous demand of both structure and process. Thus, for the future there remain the problems of what to do with the colonial urbanism inherited from the past, and how to prepare a heavy and still active heritage for post-colonial days. To transform it is also to 71</page><page sequence="72">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW impose a reorientation of the urban spatial economy. (See Mabogunje, 1980.) Part of the necessity is to transform the African urbanites' relationship to space and politics, and thence to the state. The major question now for ex-colonial cities is their decolonial urban planning and development and, of course, their post-colonial modernization. (See David Simon, 1988, 1989). But what modernization? The term remains difficult to separate from the teleology and eurocentrism of modernization theory, as underlined at the beginning of this essay. Certainly, Africa is in the integration process to modernity whereby the acquisition of Western knowledge is a necessary element. Nonetheless, it is an error to oppose a traditional mode of thinking, as ahistorical and part of innate African qualities, to a process of modernization. There is no dichotomy between a static and a dynamic culture. Modernization does not necessarily mean mere Westernization. It does mean, certainly, the necessity to improve the modes and effects of interpene- tration between cultural heritage and modern realities which has been in progress for years. People were usually left alone to manage by themselves their insertion. The mainstream of city conception and planning was the privilege of colonizers, later of modern state builders and town planners. But modernization should function differently. Let us consider, for example, one of the major issues at stake: the so-called informal sector. People have organized by them- selves their modes of earning money, of housing, of leisure, of transportation. A law such as that passed in November 1985 by the Zimbabwe government, which forbade any kind of cooking or selling of cooked food on the sidewalks close to the main markets of Harare, is a typical error in modernization. The pretext was that the habit was dirty and unhealthy, and the purpose was to favor new equipment based on official restaurants controlled by the state. The law ignored, however, the efficacy of the existing arrangement, which was quick, well adapted to the market, cheap for the consumer, and profitable for the producer. A decolonized moderniza- tion would certainly suggest improvement, but not suppression. Another path which deserves exploration is the concept of household. Clearly, some of the resource-generating activities open to households were determined by economic and political forces of the interstate system (the world economy and dependency). But, on the other hand, choices of activities are determined by households them- selves, reflecting local, cultural, and social formations; similar types of households have organized different types of production and market processes. These local forces are still insufficiently studied. The minute structures of the so-called domestic unit must be explored to appreciate from below and from the inside how social and cultural relations operate to organize participation and resistance, both of them resulting in a given interpenetration with broader economic and social structures. This mode of incorporation must be analyzed. As long as we lack a theoretical and historical account of the forces 72</page><page sequence="73">The Process of Urbanization in Africa that underpin global differentiations, we remain unable to account for processes that lie at the heart of African urban underdevelopment: the integration of the household into new networks of capitalist production; the invention of a new web of concepts and practice on land and land laws, on housing and rental; new patterns of foodstuff consumption; new regulations governing social and political life; all of these processes involving new relationships to the broader political economy which is definitely neither Western nor native behavior. The manner by which household processes interfere with social networks is connected with varied household patterns according to their location and role in the local, regional, and world economies; hence the necessity to identify and compare the evolution of households in Africa to the rest of the world, and to investigate urban households as much as rural ones (which remain the focus of Martin and Beittel, 1987). Which have been and which are in town the key resources of these unities of production, reproduction of labor, and consumption? African households are not ethnic curiosities but human realities whose organization and resources may be apprehended like other households everywhere in the world. In Africa as elsewhere we need to know how the full range of income-generating activities were combined and evolved into a viable household consumption fund over households' life cycles; these processes largely remain unclear (Martin and Beittel, 1987: 230). It would help to understand the interaction between labor force formation and changing accumu- lation patterns which arise from the combination of different sources of income. Clearly, the urban pattern is tied to circulation, migrations to the mining compounds or to the administrative centers that dominate the area, wage-labor incentives, and urban ways of life. This implies the emergence in the 19th and 20th centuries of new units of reproduction which must be studied in detail to make them more understandable today. Hence there is a need to investigate privileged "places of colonization," where change and Westernization occurred early. Obviously the city is one of these places, not only as a geographical site, but as a privileged locus for interpenetration and mediation where change was necessary for people to manage their survival and future, neither by mere collaboration nor by stubborn resistance, but through an unceasing process to adjust and combine internal social structures with external ones. Very soon, half the young population will live in African cities, more and more disconnected from their rural cultural background. Most children living in Lagos or even in Arlit (Niger), a medium- sized mining city founded in the desert twenty years ago, no longer feel comfortable with rural customs, knowledge, know-how, and wills. The home village is too far, it is too expensive to return, not only because of the costs of traveling, but also because of the necessity of bringing money and gifts to the parents. Because of the impossibil- 73</page><page sequence="74">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW ity of paying the bus fares for the whole family, only one or several adults may go for big events, such as funerals. At best, like in Arlit, families can go home once a year because their journey is paid for by the company. But in most instances the rural connection is barely alive. Within a generation, if not less, it will have ended. It is urgent that we should investigate which new mental and ideological images and concepts have reality for this urban youth. What are their needs? What kinds of education do they look for? Which jobs can they realistically hope for? What economic trends might favor the emergence and survival of these huge cities? In short, which culture is emerging and how must urbanism adapt to this culture. One of the major directions of research for urban planners should be to investigate the logic of African urbanites, which results from neither European nor American culture (but no longer from a traditional one); it is, indeed it has always been, a creation of its own in the making. The issue is no longer to ask Africans to adapt to Western norms, but to urge city planning to adapt to African needs, means, and aspirations in a modern world. This implies a reconcep- tualization of the most common concepts and issues concerning African urban societies and African urbanization. We must strengthen the connection between a historical approach to housing and town planning. Town planning is not an independent variable. It is not a model given per se which is adaptable to every civilization. It definitely must not be ahistorical. It is a process and a result. An historical approach would also imply the rejection of resources to the cultural and historical norms of the area. Concepts such as tradition or the informal sector are dead-ends. African cultural processes and African problems of employment are neither traditional nor infor- mal. In a way they are commonplace and must be studied as both universal and specific phenomena. In the recent urban bibliography (1980s onward), urban history, questions of housing and city-planning seem prevalent over social anthropology. The guiding aspirations are Eric Hobsbawm, Eugene Genovese, George Rud6, and Edward Thompson rather than Louis Wirth, Clyde Mitchell, or A.L Epstein. This is also the case for labor history, for economic, urban-rural relationships (feeding the city), and for gender studies (women's work and class). As a matter of fact, a new trend of what can be called socioeconomic, anthropological history or historical social sciences has developed which incorpo- rates the heritage of the previous sociocultural research into the understanding of economic change in connection with social adaptation and/or creativity.
