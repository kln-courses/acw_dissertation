<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 85 Michael K. Klein. Genizah Manuscripts of Palestinian Targum to the Penta- teuch. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1986 (published in 1987). 2 vols., li, 363 + 131 pp., 182 plates. Michael Klein's two beautifully produced volumes of genizah manu- scripts provide us with some vitally important materials from ancient and early medieval Judaism-the corpus of diverse Palestinian targumic mate- rials collectively called the Palestinian Targum to the Pentateuch. The first volume contains a 51-page introduction and a 363-page transcription and translation of 230 genizah fragments pieced together and forming 38 distinct manuscripts. The second volume contains 131 pages of rich notes to the text and translation, a 30-page glossary, and 182 excellently reproduced plates. Originating in the Mediterranean basin from the end of the Byzantine period through the fourteenth century and later, these manuscripts repre- sent the earliest extensive evidence of ancient Aramaic translations and elaborations of the Bible (antedated only by the Qumran Job text and two tiny fragments of Targum to Leviticus and Job and two verses on a Nippur magic bowl). Their importance lies in the sheer size of the corpus. Until the twentieth century, the Palestinian Targum was known only in an altered form from its use as a source of supplements to Targum Onqelos (published in rabbinic Bibles since 1517-18, originally directly from one of the primary sources of the four recensions of the Fragment-Targums, and only pub- lished separately in 1889 by Moses Ginzburger from one of the other recen- sions, along with several examples of a different genre of supplements, the targumic "toseftot"). In consequence, the Palestinian targumic tradition was overshadowed by Onqelos (a Targum composed in second-century Palestine but probably later reedited and vocalized in Babylonia) and Pseudo-Jonathan (a seventh- or eighth-century expansion of an earlier Palestinian Targum). This material, however, came to scholarly attention through the publication of a limited number of fragments, especially by Kahle in 1930, and then the identification, in 1956, and subsequent publica- tion, in 1968-79, of the Codex Neofiti I Targum to the complete Pentateuch (a medieval manuscript from the Vatican Library whose underlying text probably derives from the second or, more likely, third [or even fourth] cen- tury, but whose date is still debated). But the number of fragments has increased fourfold since the 1950s. Klein himself published in 1980 a collec- tion of the Fragment-Targums, consisting of fragmentary texts consciously redacted together and preserved in four distinct families (The Fragment Tar-</page><page sequence="2">86 BOOK REVIEWS gums of the Pentateuch According to Their Extant Sources, 2 vols. [Rome: Biblical Institute, 1980]), and now he presents us with his findings, based on eight years search through the genizah libraries, of manuscripts of the diverse genres of the Palestinian Targum. In addition to its size, the corpus is significant in at least three ways. First, linguistically, it comprises reliable texts for Galilean Aramaic which are free from corruption by other dialects of Aramaic and which are made readily accessible through Klein's very useful glossary. Second, it makes up a resource for a very early Palestinian system of vocalization and marginal and interlinear lectionary notations for cycles of triennial Torah portions. Third, it preserves early midrashic traditions and what Klein calls "non- normative," non-Aqiban halakhah. Klein recognizes that the latter charac- terization is problematic, but actually it should not be used at all, since, as he acknowledges, legal interpretations that may not accord with the Mish- nah may accord with the Tosefta, the two Talmudim, or early midrashim. One would have hoped that this issue had been put to rest not only by Jacob Neusner's research but also, for example, by Saul Lieberman's study of Midrash Sifrei Zuta (Siphre Zutta [The Midrash of Lydda] [New York, 1968), which demonstrates that the circles responsible for this midrash fol- lowed alternative constructions of mishnaic teachings (a "different Mish- nah"), or by David Weiss Halivni's tradition- and redaction-criticism of the Babylonian Talmud, which shows how diverse legal options were followed by the early amoraim, even regarding how to translate Scripture (see, in par- ticular, Sources and Traditions. Seder Moed from Yoma to Hagiga [Jerusa- lem, 1975], pp. 504-6).' Although the legal materials may not be significant in number, there are innumerable midrashic and aggadic traditions. We notably find not only the expected elaborations (e.g., of the Aqedah) but much new and less common material (e.g., on Exodus 12 and the exodus). Take, for example, the poem on lel shemurim, a "night of vigil" (Exod. 12:42). Introducing a messianic twist by stating that there are four nights divinely watched or anticipated, it claims that three were in the past, the third of them having taken place in Egypt the night before the exodus, and that one is reserved for the future, the night of Passover before the LORD, when God will again redeem Israel 1.

Bokser, "Recent Developments in the Study of Judaism, 70-200 C.E.," Second Century 3 (1983): 20-25.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 87 "at the end of the world." The poems introducing the chapter are even more remarkable, dramatically portraying the Hebrew months as vying with each other for the prerogative of being the one in which the exodus will take place. The volumes contain texts falling into five categories, indicating different ways in which people used and responded to Scripture. There are: 1. Targum texts proper, in scriptural order with Hebrew text, verse by verse, or with leading Hebrew lemmata, alternating between a close translation of the original and more expansive sections (e.g., on the Cain and Abel debate). Although they currently are fragmentary in nature, Klein believes they originally encompassed all of the Pentateuch. Scholars still differ over the relation of this category's material to tosefta Targum texts, that is, the targumic texts containing only the expansive material (cate- gory 4). 2. Festival liturgical booklets covering the synagogue Torah readings for festivals and special Sabbaths. These demonstrate what Torah portions were read. Their length, which indicates that Torah readings then were no longer than those in current (twentieth-century) practice, attests that the special readings were not supplement to the ongoing portions but the full reading and thus exemplifies the early Palestinian custom already mentioned in Mishnah and Tosefta Megillah. It remains, however, unclear how to explain apparently missing sections for certain holidays, such as Sukkot, and variations in the order of some manuscripts. 3. Fragment-Targums-collections of selected phrases, verses, and pas- sages put together by design by copyists/redactors. 4. Targumic toseftot-extensive expansive passages of aggadic material, some preserved as insertions into Targum Onqelos manuscripts and others as separately collected supplements to Onqelos. These do not pre- serve the pure dialect of Palestinian Targumim but only vestiges thereof, for they have been transformed to the language of Onqelos. 5. Introductory poems, beautiful and at times lengthy selections; especially notable in this regard are the thirteen aforementioned poems on Exodus 12 introducing Passover's special reading. These poems will also be pub- lished as part of a separate corpus by Michael Sokoloff and Joseph Yahalom. Klein's introduction briefly but informatively reviews the Targumim's</page><page sequence="4">88 BOOK REVIEWS translation techniques, in particular in the paraphrastic interpretive transla- tions and less so for the word-for-word equivalence portions. Among his twelve different categories, Klein includes: adding of proper names and pronouns; associative and complementary translations (reading one passage in light of another one); euphemism; avoidance of anthropomorphism; hor- tatory phrases; and what is characterized as "halakhic deviations" from "normative" halakhah (a characterization, as we noted, that needs revi- sion). Klein furthermore reviews orthographic and phonological character- istics that are important for the study of Galilean Aramaic and the dating of the Targum manuscripts. Except regarding the poems, for which Klein refers the readers to the forthcoming separate corpus, the notes are copious and quite sensitive to translation and grammatical usage and peculiarities as well as to divergences from the Hebrew original. These two volumes thus demonstrate the ways in which Scripture was mediated and adapted in antiquity and early medieval times. As biblical consecutive "Torah" portions read weekly and lengthy selected readings for special occasions both elicited Aramaic close renderings and expansive con- structions that circulated with and without scriptural texts-i.e., as a com- panion to Scripture and as independent works for independent reading-the corpus attests not only to the Pentateuch's expected place in the liturgy but also to its role as the subject of reflection and aesthetic appreciation. The latter is especially evident from the individual poems, designed either for private reading or as liturgical supplements, that introduce the Torah read- ing and highlight the message of the day or other specific themes of interest. We are indebted to Klein for this rich source, and it will now be up to other scholars to mine it for information on ancient Judaism and its synagogue life. Baruch M.
