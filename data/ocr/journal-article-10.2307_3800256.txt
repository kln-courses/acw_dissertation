<plain_text><page sequence="1">The World of the Wood Duck. By F. Eugene Hester and Jack Dermid. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia and New York. 1973. 160pp. $5.95. This is one of an extensive series of "The World of the .... ." books edited by John K. Terres which, in this instance, contains eight chapters plus an introduction, bibliography, and index. The format follows a seasonal treatment of wood ducks beginning in winter. Most of the book deals with wood duck experiences in the midsouth, especially the Carolinas. As one who has spent many enjoyable hours paddling a canoe through marshes studded with wood duck nest boxes, I felt particularly at home with this book's flavor, as might any naturalist. But this is not a recommendation for its value on the scientist's bookshelf, though I doubt, in fairness, that this was the primary intent of the authors. Even so, a book which goes so far as to include a bibliography of scientific literature, as this one does, perhaps should have made a little more serious attempt at scholarship without sacrificing a readable text. Both authors are well qualified in this regard; Hester holds a Ph.D. and is Associate Director of Fish and Wildlife for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Dermid is an Assistant Professor of Biology at the University of North Carolina. Some specific criticisms include confusing state- ments on mortality, i.e., that little is known about the extent of wood duck mortality (p. 34), although at least one of their sources, Grice and Rogers (1965), compiled a considerable amount of population data. Further, on page 38, the adult mortality rate of about 40 percent is listed as "high." This, if true, is considerably less than occurs in other species of duck far more abundant (e.g., green-winged teal); moreover, Grice and Rogers' data indicate that this statistic is actually near 63 percent as cited in Table 23 of their bulletin.

Manage. 39 (4):1975 827</page><page sequence="2">828 BOOK REVIEWS On page 84, one suddenly finds a scientific name (for arrow arum) for the first and only time, save for the wood duck itself. All other organisms mentioned in the text go naked for the want of similar treatment. What seems to be a contradiction between two portions of the text concerns the homing of wood ducks. On page 44 the authors report that young females hatched in one place but reared at another return to the place where they hatched (authors' italics), whereas on page 117 they state that "Yearling hens were later recovered at the release areas, while none were found returning to the places where they hatched." The contradiction may be more apparent than real to a practicing biologist, but the lay reader may well be confused. I question the authors' judgment regarding an explanation for migrational homing (p. 45); they believe it is more likely that young wood duck hens follow their mothers back to a specific nesting area instead of utilizing what they cite as "place memory." This is hardly a satisfying explanation, especially in light of the adult mor- tality data. Too many orphaned yearlings ex- perience homing to support this explanation of a mother-daughter guidance system. Moreover, stocking programs would seemingly work only if mother-daughter teams were used. Slips of the pen are not overly common, but include (p. 75) ". .. foods are adult and im- mature forms of ... moths and their caterpillars" (as caterpillars are the immature forms of moths, the statement is redundant); (p. 111), ". . . no flyway-wide censuses, if any at all . . ." would be more logical stated as ". . . few . . . if any . . ." and use of "wood duckling" (p. 55) for wood duck duckling (perhaps the latter is awkward but one is otherwise faced with such horrors as blue gosling or even black brantling if the practice were carried to its fullest extent). There are some statements which will strike hard at those disliking anthropomorphic nature writing, e.g., predators regard ducklings as a delicacy (p. 76). Slips of the camera are more common. This is basically a book of photos, and many of them should have been examined more critically. A hen wood duck on page 53 is almost completely obscured, yet the photo's caption stresses the hen's activities. I also find little value in the shot of a photographic blind used by the authors (p. 89). Pages 78 and 80 display, respectively, poor and good photos of essentially the same subject. There are some excellent photos, how- ever, including a hen lifting to a nest box (p. 144), a duckling perched in a nest box's entrance (p. 130), a drake in a quiet pool (p. 108) and, especially, the finely detailed shot of a hen propped outside a natural cavity nest (p. 46). There is not a single color photo of a wood duck in the entire volume, yet there is perhaps no other species in North America as deserving of a color photograph. Given the high cost of a color plate, there are so many inferior or unimaginative black and white photographs in this book that surely these could have been omitted in lieu of a single color photograph. I was pleased with the chapter dealing with man's impact-good and bad--on wood ducks as well as the one on nest boxes (although, with at least six photos throughout the book showing wooden-style nest boxes, not one was equipped with the predator-proofing devises stressed in this chapter). The authors have done well to note the disaster of misguided channeliza- tion programs so prevalent in our quest for "progress," and I commend them for their stand. The bibliography is perhaps adequate for a book of this calibre. I did not trouble myself to routinely check the accuracy of the citations, but I did note, in passing, that the work of Frederic Leopold is cited for 1965 on page 119 and as 1966 in the bibliography (1966 is correct). The format for the citations varies between journal papers and books; the date for the former appears in parentheses whereas the latter are not so enclosed. The issue number is given for some journal references but not for others. In all, I greatly prefer the bibliographic format appearing in another issue of this series, The World of the Wild Turkey, as it is quite different from the present wood duck volume. The book is well bound and quite free of typographical errors. The type is clear and the paper is of high quality. If this book was designed for the layman, then it has come close to meeting its mark, but serious students of wildlife management will not be similarly rewarded.-ERIc G.
