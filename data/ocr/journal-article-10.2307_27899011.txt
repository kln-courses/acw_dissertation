<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD. THE conception of God is the most important idea of philoso phy, science, and religion, and our attitude toward it is of vital importance for our emotional, intellectual, and moral life. It is a thought which, more than any other, covers the unity of ex istence in its entirety, and its formulation touches upon a great number of other problems. Indeed, in one form or another it is likely at any moment to present itself. Thus it is a matter of course that the conception of God has been approached in vari ous ways and can be treated in the most diverse manners. We may with mystics abandon any attempt at comprehending the problem and indulge in purely intuitional contemplations, which naturally will assume the form of visions and ecstasies. We may with moral ists point out the close relation between God and duty and preach the sermon of the categorical imperative ; or we may with the scien tist seek the ultimate raison d' tre of creation and trace the eter nal, the everlasting, the permanent in the transiency of exist ence. We might combine the three methods and start from the needs of these three aspects of human nature, the head, the heart, and the hand, and proceed on these three avenues of our life to their centre, in the hope of harmonising the results df our methods and reconciling apparent contradictions. Yet we may take still another road which is very promising. The God-idea is of historical growth ; it is (in the form in which it exists in the minds of the present generation) the product of a long evolution; it represents aspirations definite in kind and tending in a definite direction. These aspirations are by no means</page><page sequence="2">GOD. 107 all consistent ; to a great extent they are conflicting and even di rectly contradictory. Many of them are conservative and reaction ary ; others progressive and radical. A great part of them partake of the nature of instincts. They are, in their ultimate construc tions, submerged in the realm of subconscious and unconscious soul-life. In other words, they are based upon arguments which do not appear on the surface of conscious life but are buried in the traditions of the past, and have originated under the influence of the experiences of our ancestors from time immemorial, still em bodying the notions of primeval man, which, however, have been added to and have also been corrected by considerations of a more matured period. All these methods are constructive. They are methods of hand ling the material that is given and (however critical we may be in details) assumes (or, at least, may assume) as a matter of course the legitimacy of the God-idea itself. But we might attack the sub ject in quite another fashion, a fashion which at first sight appears to invalidate the whole issue, but may prove after all most fruit ful by assuming an attitude of doubt and subjecting the God-idea to a critical analysis. What if, after all, the atheist be right? Would not the whole question as to the nature of God become irrelevant? Would not the visions of the mystic have to be regarded as aberrations of the human mind? Would not the God-idea in science and philosophy be out of place, and had not ethics better dispense with it as an unfounded hypothesis, while in history it should be treated under the heading of superstitions? These questions we venture to answer with a decided no. Even from the standpoint of the atheist, the God-idea remains the most important thought in the history of the world. It is neither irrel evant nor an aberration, but contains the most important, the deep est and most comprehensive, philosophically the most explanatory, and practically the most applicable truth of all truths,-a truth which is expressed in a most telling popular way, setting forth its main features in striking human analogies and with a directness that shows at once the practical and personal interrelation of the</page><page sequence="3">io8 THE MONIST. unity of the whole to all parts, of the universal to all particulars, of God to every one of us. There is, so far as I can see, only one more attitude left, which is the agnostic position, holding that we cannot know whether God exists or not. Agnosticism, which may briefly be characterised as a bankruptcy of thought, is not only the weakest but also the most injurious philosophy. It is the philosophy of indolence which on account of its own insolvency declares that the most vital ques tions of man's life, the questions of the soul, the soul's relation to the body, the immortality of the soul, the existence of God, the creation, and the ultimate purpose of being, are beyond the reach of reason. The agnostic argument consists in glittering phrases such as "the finite cannot comprehend the infinite," which are un meaning, if analysed, but, as a rule, strongly appeal to the Philis tine who is satisfied with mere words. "The finite cannot comprehend the infinite" is such a com mon-place expression and is so thoughtlessly repeated by both rev erent and irreverent agnostics, that I may be pardoned for a short digression in pointing out its weakness. What does the phrase mean? Are the terms "finite" and "infinite" used in their strict scientific, i. e., their mathematical sense? Apparently not. For in mathematical language the "infinite" as such is not less definite and clear than the "finite." It is a process unlimited, while the finite is limited. A mathematical line is infinite. The decimal fraction 0-333, etc., if it were actually extended to equal one third would be an infinite series; the tangent of 90o is infinite, etc., etc. All these infinitudes are as little incomprehensible as the finite numbers 1,2, 3, or any other magnitude. Are the terms finite and infinite used in the mechanical sense ? Apparently not. An in finite chain, an infinite screw are mechanical contrivances which serve the same purpose over and over again. There is no begin ning and no end ; but an uninterruped round of revolutions. A cir cle, a ring, a wheel, capable of unlimited functions by returning again and again to the starting-point, are not more incomprehen sible than things definitely limited in their work, having character istic starting-points, progressive developments, and final consum</page><page sequence="4">GOD. IO9 mations. There is as little sense in the saying "The finite cannot comprehend the infinite" as in the words "The rational cannot comprehend the irrational," or "The wise can never comprehend the unwise." If, however, the words "finite" and "infinite" have a special sense, the inventor of the argument should first define the terms before he expects us to accept his conclusion as valid. There are two kinds of agnosticism : the pious agnosticism of him who would not allow the light of science to shine upon the problems of religion ; and the infidel agnosticism of the scoffer who argues that, knowledge on matters of religion being unobtainable, we ought to leave religion alone. Both views are equally reaction ary ; yet at the same time both are equally acceptable to the Phil istine who loves stagnancy because .he dislikes to do any thinking for himself. While even the atheist's denial will be helpful, the agnostic position is neither theoretically valid nor practicable, for it leaves all opinions, be they scientific, superstitious, or mere guesswork, on the same level of equal incommensurability. And this verdict holds good for agnosticism in all forms, also for Mr. Spencer's popular agnosticism adapted to the demands of the aver age reader, and even for Kant's idealism which is both deeper and more dignified. Kant demonstrates in his Critique of Pure Rea son the fallacies of the God-idea and the impossibility of offering any positive proof in its favor ; yet he proposes in his Critique of Practical Reason to postulate the existence of God. If God is to be of any account at all, his existence must not belong to things hypothetical. A God whose existence has to be postulated is worse than no God at all, and even atheism is preferable to that undefined theology which rests its ultimate argument upon our utter ignor ance of things supersensible. If we wish to be clear on this subject, which has been sur rounded with the clouds of dust raised by the quarrels of schools and factions, we must trace God in the facts of our experience. If he is not there, he is nowhere; if he is only beyond the clouds or in the realms of metaphysics, his existence is of no account and we might as well do without him.</page><page sequence="5">no THE MONIST. The monotheistic God-idea is very old. Centuries before the prophets of Israel purified the Jahveh cult, there were philosophers in Egypt and priests in Mesopotamia who proclaimed the suprem acy of the one God. An ancient brick found at Ur, whose date has been ascertained to be 2500 B. C., contained the following litany for temple service : ' ' In Heaven who is supreme ?-Thou alone art supreme. On earth who is supreme ?-Thou alone art supreme. The word is proclaimed in Heaven, And the angels bow their faces down." And a hymn of about the same date reads : ' ' Long-suffering Father, full of forgiveness, Whose hand upholds the lives of mankind, Lord, thy deity is as wide as the Heavens And it fills the sea with awe." In the history of the nations Israel has become the prophet of this monotheism. We can still trace in the Old Testament the pro cess of purification. The tribal deity of Jahveh, worshipped under the symbol of a bull in the national sacred cities of Bethel and Dan, gradually changed into the universal God of justice and truth, until in the early Christian era he was conceived as the triune Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,-which in philosophical language means God is Grund, Ursache, and Zweck of existence. He is (1) the raison d' tre, or law of being, (2) the evolution of life in its on ward aspiration, and (3) the ideal and its final consummation, the aim and purpose of existence. Now, we must in all religious ideas distinguish between the symbol and its significance, the myth and its meaning, the allegory and its lesson. Accordingly, we must analyse the God-idea and distinguish between those features which can be retained as liter ally true and those which are allegorical. Literally true are those features alone which can be traced in the facts of experience and established on good evidence as unequivocal truth. In the mythology of monotheism God is called the Father, the Lord, the Creator, the Judge. What can these terms mean? Have we to understand that God is a man as we are, a parent who pro</page><page sequence="6">GOD. III creates children that grow up and develop in his own image? Shall we regard Him as a king after the fashion of earthly rulers, surrounded by angels and archangels, as our sovereigns are by ministers of state and secretaries ? Shall we believe in the judg ment-day as pictured by Michael Angelo and other Christian art ists? The atheist rejects the belief in God on account of the crudi ties of the myth if literally accepted. And he would be right if these crudities were the essential features of the God-idea. The child-like theist says : "The world is governed by a good Father." The atheist says: "The world is governed by law." Both are wrong. There is no governing at all ; the term governing is a pure allegory which in its literal significance does not apply to the processes of nature. The truth is, there are uniformities of na ture which can be classified in universal formulas describing all possible happenings of a special type. Thus the law of gravitation does not govern the motion of falling bodies and of the coursing planets, meteors, and suns. The law, so called, is a descriptive formula which states in the tersest way possible the mode of action which things of a definite quality will take under certain conditions. That which makes the stone fall is the stone's gravity, which is an attribute of its mass, and the action of the stone's gravity depends upon the stone's position in the universe,-mainly upon the gravity (i. e., the mass) of the earth. There is no God and no law which dictates the course of action, but the things act on account of the inherent qualities which constitute them. The world is not a world of slaves, but a free play of uniformities. There is not a meta physical or theological power that forces things, be they animate or inanimate, to pursue a certain course, but all things act in a definite and determinable way by virtue of their own nature. A thief steals when the occasion arises, and an honest man pursues the straight path of righteousness, as the cat will jump at the mouse and the oxygen will combine with the carbon. None of the events of the world happen at the dictates of either a God or a law, but because things are such as to act thus. Things consist of mo tor impulses, shaped by previous conditions, and, according to present conditions, taking a definite course.</page><page sequence="7">112 THE MONIST. Is this not atheism? May be it is. All depends upon the defi nition of the word. We must not be afraid of words ; and if we find that atheism is right, let us frankly confess that we are athe ists. Thank God that the days are past when atheists were burned at the stake, and let us be assured that, on the one hand, the best theist is more of an atheist than he may grant you ; while, on the other hand, what is more important in our present discussion, the most rabid atheist is more of a theist than he himself is aware of. Let us see how. We shall start on the much abused road of the atheist and grant all that can be granted him. A scientific world-conception needs no God. Laplace answered Napoleon, when asked why there was no mention of God in his Ce lestial Mechanics, "I have no need of that hypothesis," and every man of science can give the same answer, in the same sense. Fur ther, in ethics, there is no need of the God-idea to teach morality. The God-idea is a convenient assistance to the teacher, but a mor alist of a solid philosophical education is not in need of God. Kant, for instance, opens his work on Religion Within the Limits of Pure Reason, as follows : "Morality, in so far as it is based upon the conception of man as a free being who binds himself through his reason by absolute laws, is in need neither of a su perior being than himself to recognise his duty, nor of any special motive than the law itself that is to be observed."1 Nor can it be said that our heart is in need of God. Christian mystics constantly have the word God in their mouth, but closely considered, the God of Jacob B hme, of Johannes Tauler, and other theosophical philosophers is not very different from the Bud dhist Nirvana, and we might as well express the very same senti ments in an atheistic terminology. We may grant even more. The craving for prayer which ap pears to be ingrained in the human heart seems to demand the ex istence of a God ; but what did the Son of Man, who was conscious of his Sonship of God, say when his disciples requested him "Lord, teach us to pray !" He taught them a prayer which may be char 1 Preface to the edition of the year 1793. Leipsic : Modes and Baumann, Vol. VI., p. 161.</page><page sequence="8">GOD. 113 acterised as a prayer of weaning. The Lord's Prayer is a prayer only in its form ; in its substance it is a vow to abandon prayer in the literal sense of the word. If a friend of yours prays you to do him a favor, he attempts to induce you to comply with his wish. The Lord's Prayer attunes the heart to comply with God's ordi nances, whatever they be, and to submit to his will. "Thy will be done " is not a prayer in the proper signification of the word. There is but one prayer in the Lord's Prayer which appears to be a genu ine prayer, and we have reason to believe that it suffered by being translated into Greek, viz.: "Give us this day our daily bread." The oldest versions vary greatly, and a reconstruction in the original Aramaic which is now being attempted will at best be hypothetical. Judging from other passages which express the views of Jesus of Nazareth on the same topic, the significance of the fourth prayer will be clear, if viewed in the light of the sentence, "Take no heed of the morrow. " Accordingly we are inclined to interpret it in the sense: "Let us be satisfied with our daily bread," and thus the fourth prayer would, like the other prayers, be a mere variation of the general theme expressed by Christ in Gethsemane : "Not my, but thy, will be done." Here we have a remarkable coincidence between theism and atheism. Buddhism, commonly regarded as an atheistic religion, rejects prayer as an irreligious practice and replaces prayers by vows. Analyse the Lord's Prayer, and it consists of self-exhorta tions, of vows, which serve the educational purpose of a high minded self-discipline. * * Having made all these concessions to atheism, we shall now build our God-conception upon the very foundations which atheism leaves us. There are uniformities of a definite type in natur , which render it possible to describe natural phenomena, and even predict the course of events to come. These uniformities are the conditions of science. On the one hand they make the phenomena of the world classifiable and thereby comprehensible ; and on the other hand they make possible the development of an organ of comprehension called "reason." Reason is simply the faculty of</page><page sequence="9">114 THE MONIST. tracing samenesses by designating the same type of phenomena by the same name. By comprehending samenesses we can anticipate the future and by anticipating the future we learn to seek the useful and to avoid evil. Thus, uniformities naturally produce purposive action. The apprehension of future results leads to adaptation, and adaptation pursued with conscious intention is the condition of ethics. The uniformities of nature constitute in their totality a grand harmony which is commonly called the cosmic order ; and this cosmic order comprises the motions of stars no less than the chem ical combination of atoms, and is the principle which permeates the realm of man's life, including his highest intellectual and moral aspirations. What is the raison d' tre of these uniformities? Have they, such as they are, been ordained by the Creator, or are they acci dental similarities ? Here lies the whole God-problem in a nut shell, and this is the answer that science gives : "They are neither ordained, nor are they accidental : they are intrinsically neces sary." We can best explain the peculiar meaning of the term "neces sary" by a reference to mathematics and logic. The philosophical term "necessity" must not be confounded with "compulsion." Philosophical necessity, in the sense in which we use the term, does not imply the curtailment of liberty, but denotes simply that cer tain things (including the future course of events) are conditioned in a definite way ; they can be described ; their nature, their be havior, their fate, can be determined by descriptive formulas. If a wrathful man is not checked by the fear of punishment, he will, if he be unimpeded, maltreat or even slay his adversary. He com mits the crime of his own free will according to the character of the motor ideas of which his soul consists ; he acts as he wants to act, without any external compulsion and yet with necessity. It is that inner necessity which is determined by himself, by his own char acter. In the same way the needle of the compass points toward the north by virtue of its magnetic nature. According to the phys icist's interpretation of the process, the needle, when left at liberty</page><page sequence="10">GOD. HS to adjust its position, will adapt itself to the magnetic lines of force that pass through it. Mathematics teach us to comprehend the nature of necessity, in the philosophical sense of the term. "Necessary" is not that which suffers violence or is forced by some external pressure, but that which is definitely determinable. 1 +1 = 2 is a statement which carries with it an intrinsic necessity. The same is true of 2 + 2 = 1 + 3 and of all arithmetical and geometrical theorems. Thus the sum of the angles of a triangle in Euclidean or plane space is always equal to two right angles ; and all angles having their ver tices on the circumference of a circle and subtended by the same chord are equal. There is no compulsion whatever here, but there is necessity,-that which in common parlance we call " a matter of course." Mathematics, logic, and all other formal sciences are purely ideal constructions. An action is done, or rather, it is thought, and the results that are thereby established are noted. The re sults will always be the same if the process of construction be the same, and thus an ideal-i. e., a purely mental-world of same nesses, of uniformities, is established, which when applied to the realities of the material world serves to classify its phenomena, to describe them, and to predict their future course. The formal sciences in brief describe that which is necessary and arrange all necessities into a methodical and comprehensive system which as sists us in seeing at a glance that given some function under definite conditions, certain results will take place as a matter of course. Here lies the explanation of the cosmic order with all that it im plies, science, purpose, ideals, and ethics. Now mathematics and all the other formal sciences are de scriptions, they are a system of formulas, and the question arises, Are these formulas pure inventions, or is there any reality that corresponds to them? There are philosophers who claim that the formal sciences do not formulate truths but are a /usus intellectus, a mere play of the mind. Even Kant took the word "ideal" in the sense of "subjective" which practically changed all ideal concep tions into imaginary magnitudes. On this little mistake, viz., the</page><page sequence="11">II6 THE MONIST. identification of "ideal" and "subjective," which is inadvertently made by the great K nigsberg thinker, hinges the philosophy of his critical idealism with the bold assumption of the ideality, that is to say the illusory nature, of space, time, and the categories. No won der that his system lacked system and opened a loophole for agnos ticism which has appeared in the shape of the doctrine of the unknowableness of things-in-themselves. Thus he arrived at a con clusion in which his radicalism offered a safe refuge to the reaction ary obscurantism of his time, and Kant himself made the proposi tion that he "must abolish knowledge to make room for belief,' which stands in an irreconcilable contradiction to his original aspi ration for certainty of knowledge by avoiding both dogmatism and scepticism, i. e., Wolf's dogmatism with its unfounded assump tions, and Hume's scepticism, which is a denial of strict science, changing labor into sport, certainty into opinion, and philosophy into philodoxy. Kant aspired after certainty and arrived at nes cience. Let us briefly characterise the nature of the term "ideal," in the sense in which Kant ought to have used it when speaking of Space and Time as being ideal, as belonging to the realm of ideas ! An idea is a mental picture representing some objective real ity. The objective reality need not be a concrete thing, but may be a general quality or a universal relation ; it may be a combina tion of things not yet realised, and it may be a mode of conceiving mere relations under a common aspect. In all events it must be representative, it must point beyond or outside itself, it must be a symbol of something. The nature of ideas is their significance, that is to say, ideas are not purely subjective ; they are subjective pictures of objective presences of some kind. Thus the ideal (things belonging to the realm of ideas) is not eo ipso identical with the purely subjective or illusory, but on the contrary, its most char acteristic feature is representativeness, as signifying some objective reality. Now we ask, What is the nature of the realities represented in the purely formal sciences? They are, John Stuart Mill and the whole Empiricist School notwithstanding, real presences in the</page><page sequence="12">GOD. II7 world. We may call them the purely formal laws of nature if we bear in mind that they are not laws, not coercive factors, but in trinsically necessary uniformities. Nor are they many various uni formities ; they form one great system. They are one throughout and every special formula is but one aspect under special condi tions of the same fundamental idea which may be comprised under the name of "universal consistency." They form in their totality an organic whole, a body of necessities which are all equally self evident and even in their greatest complexity a matter of course. And they are objective presences in the real world of material things. They are the formative factors of the world. While all things are transient, they are eternal ; while all existences are sub ject to change, they are the same forever and aye. They are un created and uncreatable. They are the measure of truth and stand ard of right and wrong. In a word, they are glimpses into the realms of the eternal. But consider ! Geometry, arithmetic, and logic are only partial glimpses into the glorious harmony of the divine constitution of existence. There is also, as it were, a math ematics of ethics, and a geometry of religious aspirations, the prac tical importance of which is more easily felt than understood. From the eternal moulds of these formative presences of ex istence all things proceed, and in them the forms of all things are preserved in a universal and superreal existence which knoweth not of origin or dissolution, not of birth or death, not of the anxieties of life and the fear of annihilation. The plural form of the realities which correspond to the ideas of the purely formal sciences, is justified only because we become gradually acquainted with them. They appear to the growing in tellect as a plurality of factors. But the truth soon dawns on a thinking mind that they form one grand system. We spoke of them purposely in the plural, for the sake of not anticipating the main implication of the God-idea, which consists in the organic unity of the world-order, as one consistent body of uniformities which may, not inappropriately, be spoken of as a personality, not human but divine, not bodily but spiritual and ideal, not individual, i. e., in a special place and having states of temporal succession,</page><page sequence="13">II8 THE MONIST. but eternal and omnipresent. It is obvious that the unity of all formative factors is their most essential feature, for every single aspect is complete only when viewed as an aspect of this whole or ganism. When we try to realise the importance of these presences as a unity we shall soon find that they possess a direct and per sonal relation to the life of every one of us, which (if we remain conscious of the allegory) may very well be compared to a father, a lord, a judge. Besides it partakes of all those qualities which have, since time immemorial, been regarded as the characteristic features of the Deity. In the unity of these presences we have the Allhood of existence, which is the formative principle of the world, constituting the cosmic order. This Allhood is omnipresent and eternal. It comprises everything in its loving embrace. Man has originated in its image, and reason is but the reflexion of its intrin sic consistency. It is the prototype of logic, or, as the Fourth Gos pel has it, "The Logos that was in the beginning," and thus it is the prototype of all truth. It is the world-reason, or, as it is called by the Taoists, the Tao of which Lao-Tze the venerable founder of Taoism says : ? ' It quickens all things and cherishes them ; It quickens but owns not ; It acts but claims not ; It brings up but rules not." This Allhood is not an imaginary assumption, but it is the most real factor of life. It is not only real ; it is superreal in the literal sense of the word, that is to say : It is not only a presence in the concrete things of this actual world in which we live ; but it applies generally and would be no less present in any possible world that might originate somewhere, somehow, as if by magic. Nay, it holds good for purely fictitious worlds which, after the fashion of fairy tales, endeavor to establish other laws and arrangements, that would supersede the laws of nature with which we are familiar. Even the dreams of magic do not abolish causation ; they only at tempt to alter its concatenations, and its miracles are viewed as necessary results from the supposition on which they are based.</page><page sequence="14">GOD. 119 So little can we, even when we fly into the realms of fancy, discard necessity itself. The attempt has been made to explain the world-order as a creation of God, but here the traditional conception of theism breaks down. For this omnipresence that permeates all existence is beginningless and intrinsically necessary. If this formative om nipresence be not God, if it is assumed to be different from God, then it is undoubtedly God's superior. God would have to comply with it, in order to construct the world correctly ; he would have to utilise its norms of logic and consistency, in order to be wise ; he would have to adopt its eternal principles of truth and right, in order to be moral. In other words, it would be the ulti mate authority of God himself. It would be the deity to which even the creator was subject. A duality of a Divine Omnipresence and a God-being is ob viously absurd. For a God-being that is subject to the eternal norm of rationality, of truth and righteousness, is not God in the sense that we should use the t rm to-day. Such a God would be a being, a creature, an individual existence ; it would be a god, but not God; it might be a Jupiter or a Brahma, or a world-soul. It would be much greater than any human being, but would still re main a creature such as we are, not the Allhood of existence, but a concrete, although ethereally spiritualised entity. We need not enter into all the difficulties into which the as sumption of a distinction between God and the omnipresent world order would lead us. At any rate : a God-conception which indi vidualises God and conceives of Him as a concrete being is mere paganism, whether or not it assumes the name of Christianity. But while we are conscious of the symbolic nature of the vari ous terms of the God-idea, we must not look upon them, when con sidering their significance, as untruths. The main difficulty of a purified God-idea probably consists in understanding that truths, as well as all things that are purely formal and unmaterial, are after all undeniable presences, possessed of real effectiveness in this world of actualities.</page><page sequence="15">120 THE MONIST. Let us see whether by purifying the traditional God-concep tion, we have lost anything of its religious significance. All the attributes which have ever rightly been predicated of God are here combined in the Divinity that shapes the ends of the cosmos as a whole as well as in all its details, where we are con fronted with immutability, omnipresence, eternality, universality, omnipotence, omniscience, justice, omnibeneficence, and an all embracing love, long-suffering, and mercy. Every one can readily see that the God of philosophy is im mutable, eternal, universal, and omnipresent, for God is defined as the abiding in the transient, as the law of uniformities in the variety of natural phenomena. Although it may be difficult to realise vividly in one's mind God's omnipresence, from which no one can hide even his most secret thoughts, the idea itself is clear enough. But a few words are needed on omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenefi cence, long-suffering, and love.1 It is understood that the omnipresence of the formative factors of the world is not possessed of a knowledge such as is man's. It is a higher kind of knowledge ; it is omniscience, not science. Sci ence is discursive, walking as it were on crutches and proceeding step by step. Omniscience is argument and conclusion in one. It can dispense with investigation because it possesses the result be fore it searches for it. It is the automatic workings of the truth which appears in the unfailing correctness of so-called natural laws. When speaking of God's omniscience we are apt to think of his thoughts as being like ours, transient and discursive, but they are eternal and omnipresent, and in this respect infinitely different from human thoughts. Whenever we are confronted with a truth that is found to be eternal and intrinsically necessary, be it a norm of reason or a law of nature, we are in the presence of a thought of God. Science formulates these laws, and every progress of science affords us a deeper insight into the character of God. 11 may be pardoned here for repeating myself. The next four paragraphs on the qualities of God appeared with slight additions and alterations in an article on "The Unmateriality of the Soul and God" in The Monist, Vol. VIII., No. 3.</page><page sequence="16">GOD. 121 Further, God's omnipotence is not a force that can be meas ured in footpounds. His strength is not power of muscle nor the might of armies. God's omnipotence is the irresistibility of His omnipresent will. It is the irrefragability of what appears to the scientist as the silent workings of natural law ; it is the inevitable efficacy of the still, small voice, which on account of its apparent passivity, its long-suffering and patience, makes on the superficial observer the impression of non-existence. But experience teaches that its quiet ways are unfailing. Finally, as to God's omnibeneficence, it is natural that primi tive people did not see the goodness of God. They were too de pendent still on the forces of nature to see the deeper aspects of the divine law that works for progress in the intellectual world and not less in the moral world. The soul of the savages contains too little of God's true nature to know Him correctly ; their faculty of perception is still too dull, and therefore they see Him only in the thunder-storm and hear Him not in the still, small voice. But for that reason God is in every one of us, cherishing all in loving em brace. The still, small voice is speaking, addressing every one of us personally, but we must learn to listen. And what do we gain by a purification of the God-idea? First of all, the idea of God has thus become not only scien tifically tenable but an intrinsic part of all science and philosophy. It is recognised as a name comprising all that which is the bread of our spiritual life. This God-conception reconciles Religion and Philosophy and affords a basis for a truly scientific theology. Secondly, it transfigures tradition; it fulfils its aspirations without destroying its ideals. It explains the purport of the sym bols of religious truth and teaches us to distinguish between the es sential and accidental. This God-conception reconciles Religion and History and explains the errors of the past as necessary phases in a normal development, which, according to the law of evolution, is increasingly tending truthward. Thirdly, it will liberate us from the bondage of the letter. We shall thereby learn to distinguish between symbol and truth, ritual and its significance, mythology and religion, dogma and doctrine,</page><page sequence="17">122 THE MONIST. that is to say, the lesson of the dogma. The pious need no longer fear Bible criticism and the destruction of their cherished idols ; for they will understand that the fundamental truths of religion are based upon the recognition of that which is eternal. This God-con ception digs down to the bottom rock of the conditions of a reli gious world-conception and affords a foundation which can never be shaken in the progress of science and civilisation. These are great advantages, which will be appreciated by all those who have ever seriously grappled with the problem of the ex istence and nature of God. Before we close our discussion I wish to touch briefly on a sub ject which may to many yearning souls be of incalculable impor tance. I wish to forestall misinterpretations which will actually arise in those to whom the present view is yet novel. This purer God-conception loses nothing of the definiteness and personality of the old God-conception. A surrender of the letter does not imply a surrender of the spirit that God is our Father, our Lord, our Judge, our Comforter, our Saviour, the pro totype of the incarnated Christ-ideal, the Way, the Truth, and the Light. This God-conception is not the old pantheism which identifies God and the All. God is in all things, but He is also beyond and above all things. Nor is He the sum-total of all things. God is the Allhood of existence, but in addition he is the condition of any possible existence. He is in nature and yet different from nature. He is in reality but different from all real things. He is the super natural in nature and the superreal in real things. He is the form ative of things material, himself unmaterial. This God-conception does not teach the impersonality, but the superpersonality of God. God is the condition of all personality God's nature is not an indefinite omneity, for He is possessed of a very definite character constituting the significance of existence as a whole and laying down the purpose of all existence, as well as imparting a definite direction to all life aspirations which finds ex pression in the evolution of solar systems, of nations, of individu als.</page><page sequence="18">GOD. I23 God is further not an indifferent being to us. He has a per sonal and private relation to all His creatures, being nearer to every one of them than the beat of their hearts and the neural vi brations of their brains. He is in them and yet different from them and infinitely high above them. He is their life, their home whence they start, and the goal whither they travel. God is not like us, but we are like him. He is the light of our life, He is the mariner's compass which guides us, and the an chor of hope on which we rely. Unless we feel his presence, we shall find no peace in the restlessness of the world. Unless we sanctify our lives by the purport which his existence imparts to all life, we can find no comfort in our afflictions. Unless we recognise that our soul is an actualisation of his eternal thoughts, we shall not learn to fight the right way in the struggle for existence. Unless we listen to the still, small voice that teaches us our duties, we shall not obtain that blissful assurance which the childship of God alone can afford. EDITOR. DISCUSSION. The preceding article on "God," which was twice used as a lecture, elicited before the philosophical club of the University of Chicago a lively discussion, in which problems closely connected with the God-idea were presented. On another occasion before the philosophical club of the University of Ann Arbor, where no discussion took place, the lecturer was afterwards privately inter rogated by several inquiring minds. And since these topics may be of interest to our readers, we shall reproduce such of the ques tions and answers here as contain the gist of our conversations : Question 1. 1 ' Your formulation of the God-problem contains two sides ; one part of it is strictly scientific, the other religious. How do you unite both ? " I have endeavored to present a plain statement of facts and have then given a religious appreciation of those factors which shape the world at large and deter mine our lives, '*roughhew them as we may." These factors are eternal neces</page><page sequence="19">124 THE MONIST. sities : that is to say, we can understand that they must be such as they are and cannot be otherwise. They are not a plurality of factors, but are one throughout. They are uncreated and uncreatable, and therefore not the ordinance of a deity. They form an inevitable omnipresence in which all things live and move and have their being. On the one hand they are not an individual being of concrete exist ence; they are not here nor there ; but they are truly everywhere at once. They are not this nor that particular existence which says "I am," excluding any other " thou " ; they are not anything particular ; they are the universal in the particu lar. Yet, on the other hand, they are neither nonentities. Although they are not concrete entities, they are none the less real. Indeed, they are the most important feature of everything real. They would remain the same, even though all material reality were annihilated. In this sense they are superreal. If nature did not exist, they would remain true ; in this sense they are supernatural. They constitute the possibility of mentality and of moral aspirations and thus they build a higher realm of spiritual life upon the purely physical domain of existence. In this sense they are super physical. Being the purely formal features of existence, they are the prototype of reason and the foundation of everything intellectual, mental, spiritual. Although universal, they are not indefinite ; on the contrary, they are the de termination of every definite suchness in the world. Although not particular and not individual, they are not lacking in that which constitutes personality ; they possess a specific character which is sufficiently pro nounced to lay down for all its creatures certain ascertainable rules of conduct and a standard of moral goodness. These are facts concerning which there can be no disagreement; and they possess a direct bearing on our lives. They are the realities in the experience of mankind which were formulated under the name of God, and on our attitude toward them our entire life depends-our world-conception, our ultimate motives of ac tions, our moral ideals, our comfort in the vicissitudes of fate, our destiny in gen eral. Should this realm of the most important realities remain neglected ? Should the superreal, the supernatural, the superphysical be left unheeded because its truth is more subtle than the grossly real, the crudely natural, the merely physical, the material ? Certainly not. The historian can watch the growth of an appreciation of these higher factors of life in the development of religion which instinctively dis covers the most salient moral truths and expresses them in allegories and parables. Are the parables untrue because they must not be taken literally ? No, and a thou sand times no ! Religion is not the product of priestcraft but is the natural outcome of a groping after the truth. Mythology is the dawn of religion, as alchemy and astrology are the beginning of chemistry and astronomy. There is a close analogy between the religious and scientific evolution of man ; and let us bear in mind that evolution has its phases ; it passes through several stages ; and if we have succeeded in attaining to the solution of a great problem, it will prove to be only a starting</page><page sequence="20">GOD. I25 point for new problems. Evolution is never closed. Life is growth and comple tion, and consummation would mean death. The religious life of mankind is no exception. There are still higher vistas of a deeper religious revelation in store for us, and they will justify the religious aspirations of former periods. They will come to fulfil, not to destroy. They will teach us the reality of the still, small voice in the human heart and afford us a key to the significance of the mythology of the savage and of the parable as it was crystallised in mediaeval dogmatism. Question 2. "Is not your God-idea a mere abstraction and therefore lacking in the vitality which is indispensable for a religious conception ?" This question rests upon the assumption, which is quite common among many people, that abstract ideas are empty, unmeaning, and unreal. This is an error. Abstract ideas are, if they are but true, as significant as their poetical personifica tions ; there is only this difference between the two, that while abstract ideas are more definite, the people who are not trained in exact thinking are more impressed by poetical descriptions than by concise formulas. To attempt giving a philosophical definition of God in a missionary sermon ad dressed to the Zulus, or in our midst, to a Salvationist meeting, would be as much out of place as trying to teach mathematics or explain the falling of stones by the Newtonian formula to a child of three or four years. But because abstractions are empty and unmeaning to the unschooled, they are of the greatest importance and full of significance to those who have acquired the habits of exact thought. He who speaks of abstractions as being empty, only proves that he is still in the period of mental infancy for which the milk of mythology is alone the proper food. He can not yet digest the meat of scientific accuracy. Question j. "Is not a certain anthropomorphism allowable in speaking of God ? " Anthropomorphism in speaking of God is not only allowable, but, according to circumstances, even indispensable, for it is the means and the sole means by which the untutored masses, the half-civilised races, and all the many adult children that we find everywhere, can be approached. Anthropomorphism was a necessary phase in the religious evolution of man kind and will remain indispensable even to the scientific thinker for the purpose of artistic and emotional expressions. Only we must remain conscious of our anthro pomorphism and must avoid drawing conclusions from terms which are purely alle gorical. For instance, God is not a father in the literal sense. Take the allegory in the literal sense, and the highpriest, Ananias, was justified in denouncing the very thought of it as blasphemy. On this ground Mohammed rejects the Christian doc trine of the sonship of Christ. But understand that it is an allegory, symbolising God's intimate relation to every one of us, and it will be difficult to find a more beautiful and more impressive simile.</page><page sequence="21">126 THE MONIST. Question 4. ' ' Do you regard this view of God as compatible with the Chris tian conception of God ? " It is not only compatible with the Christian conception, it is the Christian con ception itself, in its matured and purified form. Any one who holds the traditional conception of God will, as soon as his mind becomes scientifically trained, be con fronted with problems as to the nature of God. In the face of the truth that the world order is not made but intrinsically necessary and eternal, he can no longer look upon God as an individual being who makes worlds as the watchmaker makes watches. If it is impossible that God ordained those uniformities which are com monly called natural laws, the question rises, "Is God subject to certain universal necessities, or if not, what is his relation to them?" The solution here offered which regards every law of the cosmos, everything eternal in nature, everything universal in our experiences, as a part and parcel of God himself, will appeal only to those who have been confronted with the problem. Those who know of science and philosophy from hearsay only will not be in need of any reconciliation between religion and science, and we must excuse them for regarding the very attempt at comprehending the significance of God as a waste of time and idle talk. Question 5. .4 Your conception of God is quite simple and apparently accept able to the theist and the atheist. But it takes away all mystery." Well ! The purpose of every scientific and philosophical investigation is to do away with a mystery of some kind. An unsolved problem mystifies us, but when it is solved the facts are clear, and we might repeat with Schopenhauer, ' . Simplex -veri sigillum." Question 6. "Is not mystery God's very nature ? " Many people love the mysterious and are afraid of clear thought ; but if God really represented the mysterious, i. e., the inexplicable, and atheism clear thought or the solution of problems, the duty of science would be to reduce the domain of God to the utmost and if possible to let him entirely disappear. But God, if he is God at all and not merely the stay of superstition, is the light of the world, not its darkness ; he appears in the order of the world and not in the supposed reversions of the world-order, commonly called miracles ; he is the principle that pervades science, that conditions reason, and enhances progress, not a personification of obscurantism, ignorance, and reaction. Question 7. . ' Do you not explain too much ? Do you not explain God away and leave intangible relations, pure form, and natural laws in his place?" Is it possible to explain too much ? Does a phenomenon which is understood disappear ? The reality of God remains the same whether or not his nature be un derstood. But we have the advantage of avoiding the errors connected with a lit eral belief in the allegories under which God is comprehended by the uneducated masses of mankind.</page><page sequence="22">GOD. 127 Do you think that music ceases to be music if we understand that the objective reality outside of us are air-vibrations, the intervals of which possess definite math ematical proportions ? The beauty of music remains the same whether or not we understand its nature. It is the same with fire, electricity, life, and all other pro cesses of nature. Fire was formerly supposed to be a peculiar stuff; it was regarded as one of the imponderable substances and was called phlogiston. Since we under stand that fire is a mode of motion and not an imponderable stuff, we know that the existence of phlogiston is a pure invention of the misguided imagination of former scientists, but fire is as real now as it ever was. Thus that ultimate zvhy of existence which by one word we call God, remains as real to-day as it ever was of yore, only we know to-day better what it is. Question &lt;?. "Is not the term superpersonal a mere euphemism for imper sonal ? If God is not an individual, he cannot be a person, for every per son is an individual." Allow me the counter-question, What constitutes personality ? I grant that every person is an individual which is possessed of particularity, being bodily al ways at a given moment in a special place. A person in this sense is here, not there, and in this sense God is not a person. But the personality of man consists in his being possessed of reason and pursuing rational purposes. What is reason but the recognition of the universal ? If the universal takes abode in an individual, the individual changes into a person, or in other words, it acquires personality. God is the principle of personality itself ; he is the condition that renders person ality possible. In his image man is made. Question g. "Is not a person, an individual, endowed with reason, or intelli gence, sentiency, and will ? " Yes ! But sentiency is not a quality which is typical of personality ; it is not a feature that belongs exclusively to man ; it belongs in the same degree to the ani mal. That which constitutes the characteristic feature of personality is the intel ligence of the universal in experience which is rendered possible through language. Every man is, in this sense, more or less an incarnation of the Logos. In him the notion has originated of that which remains the same in all changes. He sees things (as Spinoza has it) sub specie cetertii, under the aspect of the eternal. Allow me here to call your attention to the close connexion between sentiency and matter. All sentiency is particular ; it is always in a special place and time ; it is always awareness of material objects, involving material existence. Sentiency originates through a contact of matter with matter. Matter has been defined as the sense-perceived, and sentiency is the matter-perceiving. As to God, taking God now as the absolute Deity which in the Christian dogmatology is called God the Father, viz., the formative factors of the world, or God the Creator, we should say that He is unmaterial and is not a sentient being. God is called "holy," which means, separated from everything sensual and sensory. Yet God possesses a definite</page><page sequence="23">128 THE MONIST. character, and His character determines the nature of truth and falsehood, of right and wrong, of goodness and badness. While God is not an individual, he is not devoid of personality. A system of truths, or rather of such norms determining the actual world as can be formulated in statements of fact, in laws or truths, may be called a spiritual body, an organ ism, or a personality; for it is that which constitutes the personality of a person. In this sense God is not a person but a personality. Further, God manifesting Himself in evolution and culminating in the God-man, God as the divinity of this actual world of ours, the second person of the Christian trinity, is even as a cosmic principle endowed with personality. He has a will, or to avoid even the sem blance of anthropomorphic expressions, he is the determinedness of the process of evolution. The universe has a definite character which is that which makes for progress, the onward motion of mankind, the power that makes for righteousness; the bliss of goodness, the curse of sin ; in a word, the verdict of consequence which inevitably follows every deed according to the law of causation. God has a will, and He pursues a definite design ; only His will is not like the will of a man ; His will is the eternal determinedness of events ; His design is not the plan of a Prome theus (i. e., a fore-thinker), a meditating plodder, a deliberate worker and construc tor ; God's design is the immanent, eternal order of things and the unalterable, im mutable necessity that naturally produces the obviously noticeable fitness of things. After these comments the remark will not be misunderstood, that God is not an individual being but after all he possesses personality ; yet his personality is different from the personality of man, which is the personality of an individual, and therefore I prefer to call God superpersonal. Question io. " Is God conscious of himself? " The question should be, How does God become conscious of himself ? Con sciousness is a representation of oneself for the purpose of adapting one's conduct to the requirement of circumstances. God as the absolute unity of the formative factors of the world, the ultimate norm of all existence in its superreal eternality, is not in need of consciousness and could not, without gross anthropomorphism, be said to be conscious of himself. But God in his practical attitude as the manifesta tion of the Divine in the process of evolution necessarily becomes conscious in the ideal aspirations of mankind which are pursued with purposive efforts of a morally determined will. God awakens to consciousness in man, and here we are con fronted with the deepest truth of Christianity. The self-consciousness of God is realised in the God-man, in Christ, in the man of good will, in him whom Buddhists call the Perfectly Enlightened One, and Taoists the Superior Sage, or Holy Man. Mohammedanism saw in the trinity doctrine a tritheism ; it returned therefore to a rigid unitarianism which conceived God in his absolute aspect alone. To the strict unitarian the word of St. John, "I and the father are one," is as much blasphemy, as the idea of God as being love itself, appears as a veiled atheism. Mohammed</page><page sequence="24">GOD. 129 declares that God is unbegotten and he does not beget. Accordingly he abhors the idea of Christ's sonship. From our standpoint the Christian trinity doctrine is a decided progress upon the prior unitarianism as it deepens the God-idea and dwells on the importance of the divine immanence in the evolution of moral ideals. Question II. "DO you believe that mere relations are real ?" I do not believe, I know. Belief of any kind is excluded from this scientific formulation of the God-idea. There is nothing hypothetical about it ; it is a sys tematised formulation of facts. These so-called mere relations, or these purely formal uniformities, are not substances, are not energies, are not metaphysical es sences of any kind ; yet they are the determinants of the world. Real means that which produces effects. The German wirklich shows the significance of the term in its etymology. Wirklich is that which works, or pro duces effects, that which determines the suchness of causation. Now, the purely formal uniformities are the determinative element of the forms of reality. If any thing is real, they are real. Their reality is different from the reality of a stone or any other concrete object ; but it is rather more than less real. The reality of a definite piece of matter is in one place, but the reality of the law of gravitation is ubiquitous, and this is not a matter of belief, it is a scientific truth, demonstrable in experience and verifiable by experiments. Question 12. "Is not belief an essential element in religion? " No! Belief is not essential, but faith is. Belief is imperfect knowledge. Should not the perfect be better than the imperfect ? Belief is only essential to religion if the word is used in the sense of faith. We must distinguish between faith and belief. The Greek word mang means faith, confidence, trust ; and the Hebrew njlttS means firmness, reliability, trust worthiness. Belief in the sense of accepting unverified and unverifiable statements without investigation is not only not essential in religion, but downright irreligious. It is a sacred duty to inquire and gain as much light as possible on the main prob lems of life. To take for granted certain doctrines which are handed down to us by tradition, is immoral and must lead to the sanctification of superstition. What we need in life is not belief but faith. Belief is a matter of intelligence, or rather of neglect of intelligence; faith is a moral attitude. We need faith, i.e., faithful ness, firmness, stability, moral earnestness in life. We need the inspiration of good will toward all, above all we need a trust in truth. Indeed, we might condense the definition of the religious attitude to these three little words : religion is ' ' trust in truth." Question JJ. "Do you think it possible that a clergyman could hold your views and remain in his church ? " Certainly I do think so. In fact, I have received letters from various clergy men-personally unknown to me-who thanked me for the light they had received from writings of mine on the religious question. Two of them wrote that, having</page><page sequence="25">THE MONIST. been affected by the contradictions between the letter of the dogma and the results of science, they had thought of leaving the Church, but now they saw their re ligious traditions in a new light and had thereby been enabled to find a conciliation between religion and science. They could now stay in the Church. They felt no longer the bitter self-reproach of hypocrisy, but could attend to their duties with a clear conscience and in gladness, as they had done in younger years before the scruples of doubt had attacked their souls. One clergyman told me that he had formerly seen no other way out of the difficulty than by turning to agnosticism for comfort, but now he saw that the religious evolution tended toward a scientific re ligion which would no longer be in need of mysticism. How compatible a philosophical conception of religion is or can be with the active duties of a clergymen may be learned from the fact that Bishop Berkeley Herder, and Schleiermacher were bold and radical thinkers. I may also mention Pope Sylvester II. and other men of scientific distinction among the clergy. If my philosophy be incompatible with the position of a clergyman, the philosophies of these men, too, ought to be condemned as heretical. I propose a philosophical interpretation of certain facts which have produced religion, the Churches, and dogmas ; or rather I formulate the facts and show them Under a certain aspect, that is all. I do not deny the facts ; I deny only some un scientific explanations of these facts and replace them by a simpler explanation which abandons the antiquated metaphysical views and reconstructs the experi ences of our religious life upon the basis of a rigid positivism. Question 14. 41 But are not clergymen pledged to accept a belief in the letter of their dogmas?" The pledges of clergymen when they are ordained are different in different churches. In some denominations they are very loose and allow much liberty ; in others they are more direct ; but, so far as I know, a belief in the letter is nowhere exacted. On the contrary, the most dogmatic churches give their members the greatest freedom of interpretation. The faith of the church is laid down in the symbolical books, from the Apos tolic Creed down to the most recent confessions of faith and platforms, but the very name 44 symbolical " implies that they contain truths which are not stated with scientific precision but in terms of symbols. The very first sentence of the Apos tolic Creed, "I believe in God the Father," is an obvious allegory, and the alle gorical nature of the term has never been denied. These formulations of doctrine are first of all historical documents ; they must be treated with reverence and re spect. We accept them as we accept the testaments of our parents and grand parents. They have been made to assist us, not to enslave us. It is our duty to think the same problems over again and revise the old statements in the fuller light of modern science. P. C.</page></plain_text>
