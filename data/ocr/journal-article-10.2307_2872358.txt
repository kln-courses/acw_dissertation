<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO KINDS OF VISION IN MARIANNE MOORE BY A. K. WEATHERHEAD In reading certain poems of Marianne Moore, it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of vision operating in them. There is the bird's-eye-view which presents a general panorama and fails to recognize discrete particulars; and there is the close-up, accu- rate study which recognizes the latter and does not subordinate them to a general picture. Often the two kinds of perception may be observed to be at work in the same poem, each contributing its own images. And, briefly, the images purveyed by the general view most often give rise to false conclusions and express senti- mental feelings, while those that are the product of the accurate detailed study give rise to careful moral judgments and express, with some reticence, discriminated feelings. Sometimes, as a varia- tion, two different attitudes toward a single visual scene, one of them analogous to the general view, the other to the close-up, counterpoint one another. When there are two views or attitudes present in a poem the cruder one is generally dismissed, usually implicitly, in favor of the accurate one; or the former is corrected by the latter. A study of the poet's use of this twofold approach not only throws light on the poems where both approaches are clearly present but helps to reveal an important feature, the essential code, one may say, of the poet and her work: that truth and feeling must rest upon minutely perceived, finite detail. The two kinds of vision may be easily recognized in "The Steeple-Jack," where an important contrast is formed between the images provided by the bird's-eye-view of the town-the view enjoyed by the steeple-jack up aloft-in the first part of the poem and those that come from a closer study in the second. In the first four stanzas of the shorter version of the poem, the emphasis on sight is apparent: there are " eight stranded whales / to look at "; "You can see a twenty-/five pound lobster "; and the storm 482 Two Kind8 of Vision in Marianne Moore</page><page sequence="2">is visible: "'it is a privilege to see so / much confusion." ' But the view in this part of the poem provides not so much a descrip- tion of a town as a description of a sentimental picture of one: water is " etched / with waves," gulls sail around the lighthouse, the sea is overtinted. The storm destroys the romantic picture exactly as it does in Hawthorne's " Sights from a Steeple." In the fifth stanza, with the lines A steeple-jack in red, has let a rope down as a spider spins a thread, the point of view changes and the general view gives way to the close study. The act of seeing is now different: the words de- scribing it are not now " You see," but " One sees," " one " being the pronoun the poet frequently uses for personal observations. The items now perceived are parts of the real everyday world, the school house, the post office, the fish- and hen-houses; they are not necessarily picturesque, but simply objects seen by a viewer with, literally and figuratively, her feet on the ground. One important image purveyed by the accurate view is the sign set up by the steeple-jack. Its message is given some prominence in the poem, appearing as the first word of a stanza: the sign in red and white says Danger. We are warned by this not only of the physical danger but of the danger of sentimentally concluding that the town is merely the picturesque place that has been presented in the images pur- veyed through the vision of the steeple-jack which have occupied us up to this point. There follow the realistic details; and we deduce, among other things, that the livelihood of the town, depending as it does on the unpredictable sea, is more precarious than the bird's-eye-view had suggested.2 All the same, the final stanza begins, " It scarcely could be dangerous to be living / in a 1 Collected Poem-s (New York, 1959), p. 13.

The point is that when the danger has been fairly faced, as it has here by the acknowl- edgment of the realistic situation, it has been contained. The realistic view has neutralized the sentimental one; and from ground level looking up one may safely entertain hope a hope based on solid foundations as the star is based on the steeple of the church. The statement the poem makes is not, surely, only pertinent to the local situation* In many places throughout the poetry of Marianne Moore a careful study of realistic particulars forms a protection against the danger of sentimentality and inaccurate judgment or the evils associated with these, moral obtuseness and arrogance, which the general view is apt to incur. The arrro- gant man in "A Grave," for instance, who took the view from Miss Moore and her mother, is condemned for his attempt to "stand in the middle of a thing," the sea (Collected Poems, p. 56). The sea is a large vague abstraction; one may be sentimental about it, but poetry is incompetent to deal with it accurately as a whole and had better not approach it except by way of clear discrete particulars. Aware of this, the poet herself assumes toward the sea a respect which is quite contrary to the intruder's brashness. Her vision is directed to particular, finite phenomena at the periphery or on the surface: there are the famous fir trees which " stand in a procession, each with an emerald turkey-foot at the top " or the wrinkles at the surface which " progress among themselves in a phalanx-beautiful under networks of foam." The extent of the poet's contempt for people or things which disregard details is sometimes amusing. The steamroller, for in- stance, in a poem quoted below, is an object of it; so are the culprits of crimes committed over a disputed legacy in "The Icosasphere." These are charged, of all things, with a failure in "integration" and are compared unfavorably with birds, which "c' weave little bits of string and moths and feathers and thistle- down, / in parabolic concentric curves,"' and with the inventors of the icosasphere who have so learned to manage details that sheets of steel can be rounded to a ball with maximum economy (Collected Poems, p. 1429). The principle, implicit throughout Marianne Moore's work, that attention must be paid to details and that truth and feeling 484 Two Kinds of Vision in Marianne Moore</page><page sequence="4">must be based on the perception of them is clearly embodied in "The Paper Nautilus." There are the minutely perceived details: the intensively watched eggs coming from the shell free it when they are freed,- leaving its wasp-nest flaws of white on white, and close- laid Ionic chiton-folds like the lines in the mane of a Parthenon horse, round which the arms had wound themselves .... (Collected Poems, pp. 122-3) These "intensively watched " details give rise to the conclusion that " love / is the only fortress / strong enough to trust to." But this is not ceremoniously submitted as a universal truth in quot- ableform: one is not supposed to carry it away like, say, a couplet of Pope's. On the contrary, it is a very particular truth firmly attached to the percepts which gave rise to it: the arms had wound themselves as if they knew love is the only fortress . The scrutinized details which produce the moral judgment also express personal feelings. The paper nautilus is in a sense the poet herself who, working indeed with paper, constructs a form, a part of herself, in which to foster and deliver her ideas. These " coming from / the shell free it when they are freed" and leave evidence of the love and care that had encompassed them. In such a way the poem expresses with extreme reticence the complex of personal feelings, conflicting senses of freedom and deprivation, that attend the poetic acts3 M. Jacques Maritain has deplored the scrupulous attention Miss Moore pays to " the world of sensory perception " and sug- gests that such modesty should yield to the "pressure of what exists " within.4 The italics are his; and at the risk of being ob- vious it is worth saying that because feelings are strictly con- ']Kenneth Burke says of this poem that " the themes of bondage and freedom . . are fiercely and flashingly merged " (A Grammar of Motives [New York, 1954], p. 502).

Weatherhead 485</page><page sequence="5">trolled in a poem, this one or another, one must not deduce that they are absent or even that they are not intense. The style certainly does not arise from any failure of feeling; on occasion Miss Moore has in fact yielded to her feelings to produce less characteristic poetry (but poetry not without fine qualities of a different kind), such as "In Distrust of Merits." No images from the bird's-eye-view are presented in "The Paper Nautilus ": the operations of the tiny animal are invisible to anything but careful scrutiny. But, in contrast to the poet herself, persons like the intruder in "A Grave" who would be likely, out of arrogance or sentimentality, to use the general view are referred to; and we learn that for them the activities of the paper nautilus are irrelevant: For authorities whose hopes are shaped by mercenaries? Writers entrapped by teatime fame and by commuters' comforts? Not for these the paper nautilus constructs her thin glass shell. The bird's-eye-view is most frequently associated with senti- mentality or arrogance; but it need not be so, and it is not always incapable of appreciating particulars. In " Tom Fool at Jamaica " Signor Capossela has a point of vantage-" Up in the cupola comparing speeds." But he keeps his head: "It's tough," he said; " but I get 'em; and why shouldn't I? I'm relaxed, I'm confident, and I don't bet." 5 He doesn't bet: that is, there is no overriding consideration which might compromise the accuracy of his perception of the details. The fact is important in a poem whose message is, DQ not let any system-any general view of things, one may legitimately gloss-compromise fidelity to particular truths: Be infallible at your peril, for your system will fail, and select as a model the schoolboy in Spain who at the age of six, portrayed a mule and a jockey who had pulled up for a snail. 5Like a Bulwark (New York, 1957), pp. 12-13. Quotations reprinted by permission of the Viking Press. 486 Two Kinds of Vision in Marianne Moore</page><page sequence="6">The notes supply the drawing of the mule and jockey checked for the sake of the small particularity! But the poem proceeds to show, among other things, how the poet herself is checked in full career and achieves restraint when she is in danger of sentimen- talizing over Tom Fool, the racehorse. Aware that her enthusiasm is carrying her away into a rhapsody, a sentimental appraisal not based upon strict perception, she breaks off her discourse about the horse and side steps into a new series of images of jazz musicians: * . . like centaurs' legs in tune, as when kettledrums compete; nose rigid and suede nostrils spread, a light left hand on the rein, till well-this is a rhapsody. Of course, speaking of champions, there was Fats Waller with the feather touch, giraffe eyes, and that hand alighting in Ain't Misbehavin'! Ozzie Smith and Eubie Blake.... The poet's control of sentimentality by a parade of visual images is sometimes more noticeable than it is here. In the face of the danger, she proliferates images which are only fancifully related to the object to which the strong feeling is attached. Feeling inheres strongly in images which dissolve and fuse to- gether to produce a new whole-the process Coleridge attributed to the operation of the imagination. It is dissipated, on the other hand, among images which are related casually only by one or two features-the work of Coleridge's fancy-or related only by rhyme. Marianne Moore's use of visual images in this way appears to a small extent in " The Paper Nautilus," where the perception of "wasp-nest flaws / of white on white" leads, via the image in "Ionic," to the imagery of "the mane of / a Parthenon horse." But the begetting of fresh images is checked at this point, and the moral statement comes forth There is a similar kind of control of feeling operating in " Leonard da Vinci's," where the poet seems to be amused at her own trick. The end of the poem playfully associates his pet lion with St. Jerome, who " left us the Vulgate "; and by this means, the poet masks her strong admiration for the saint, the " pacific," " passionate," and " great " man, and for his legacy. In the following lines we see her leading away from the matter with the emotional content by fancifully linking St. Jerome and his Vulgate, the great spiritual nourishment, with the fact A. K. Weatherhead 487</page><page sequence="7">that the Nile rises in the sign of the Zodiac Leo to fertilize the crops and the fact that fountains frequently discharge their water through the mouths of lions. Thus the production of the Vulgate may also be allowed to be a leonine quality. That in Leo, the Nile's rise grew food checking famine, made lion's-mouth fountains appropriate, if not universally, at least not obscure.' It is in these last two lines that the poet seems to be casting an amused, oblique glance at her own technique of fanciful asso- ciations. With some of her poems one feels that Miss Moore is more content to conceal the message of the poem than to run the risk of being carried away by her feeling, and overstating it. She is reminiscent of her own frigate pelican, not only because in her use of quotations she takes " on the wing, from industrious crude- winged species / the fish they have caught," but because with admirable sprezzatura, "the unconfiding frigate bird hides / in the height and in the majestic / display of his art" (Collected Poems, pp. 31-32). In one fairly recent poem she virtually admits to the policy of concealment. The central concern of " In a Public Garden " is the plight of refugees. But this subject is introduced overtly only as one item in a catalogue of casually associated images and ideas. Then, at the end of the poem, expressing the intention " to wish poetry well" (in the first version, "to wish real poetry well ") ,7 the poet is glad that poetry may legitimately have a personal component-" glad that the Muses have a home and swans-"; and in the last two lines, she is "happy that Art, admired in general,/ is always actually personal" (O To Be a Dragon, p. 21). She is glad that she has been able, even in a public poem, to deliver herself with great reticence of her private feelings. In " The Steeple-Jack," meaning lay in the relationship between two kinds of vision; in this poem the meaning lies in the rela- tionship between two attitudes to a scene and situation* Corre- 6 0 To Be a Dragon (New York, 1959), p. 31.

The poem first presents the features of spring and certain memories. But then the poet turns from these items to the train of private thoughts they arouse in her. It is as if, at the sight of spring and all it brings forth, she turned inward, like Moschus in his " Lament for Bion " and so many subsequent elegists, to the private sorrow at the thought of what the season cannot bring-freedom and opportunity for the refugees in the trans-shipment camp. The poem begins: Boston has a festival- compositely for all- and nearby, cupolas of learning (crimson, blue, and gold) that have made education individual. The poet then recalls the remark of a taxi-driver: "' They / make some fine young men at Harvard."' She recalls the gilding of the weathervane on Faneuil Hall " by / a -leafer and -jack," that is, presumably, a gold-leafer and a steeple-jack. And she notes some features of spring. In the second part of the poem (the division is not indicated on the page) the poet enters King's Chapel to hear them sing: "My work be praise while others go and come. No more a stranger or a guest but like a child at home." A chapel or a festival, she proceeds, means gifts, among which are black sturgeon-eggs-a camel from Hamadan, Iran; a jewel. . .. Other gifts are silence and freedom-" ' freedom to toil' / with a feel for the tool." Then immediately follows the situation of the refugees: A. K. Weatherhead 489</page><page sequence="9">Those in the trans-shipment camp must have a skill. With hope of freedom hanging by a thread-some gather medicinal herbs which they can sell. Ineligible if they ail. In " The Steeple-Jack," once again, the vision in the first part of the poem is corrected by that in the second: when looked at realistically, the town is not merely the pretty picture we had been first shown. So here, the sweetness of the imagery of spring turns sour when we see how it is related to the central subject. The sweetness is deliberately overdone: spring is " a more than usual / bouquet of what is vernal "; from its description, nothing must be omitted: "O yes, and snowdrops /in the snow, that smell like / violets." The attitude is gently blas&amp;spring and all that! The tone is slightly reminiscent of Milton's description of the vernal garden where there was " enormous bliss." And the comparison is not completely wayward, since elsewhere among general views of scenes in Miss Moore's poetry we shall find hints of the prelapsarian world which is subjected to delicate ridicule. The images, in the first part of the poem, are not, as they seem at first, merely a collation that presents itself to a free-wheeling mind. They are all related, more or less ironically, to the central subject, the plight of the refugees. And the poet's tact in conceal- ing feeling may be judged in part by observing the sentimentality of the following comments in which the relationship is expressed. There is a public garden and a festival " for all "; but neither is open to the refugees. There is the greater privilege-the private university for learning skills individually; but the refugees, though they also may be "fine young men," unless they already have a skill, have no access even to general freedom let alone a univer- sity. Faneuil Hall is known as the " Cradle of Liberty "; the situa- tion of the "-leafer and -jack" may have been precarious, but so is that of those whose hope of freedom is "hanging by a thread." (The gilding of the weathervane etc. may possibly be directly associated here with hope, as it is in " The Steeple-Jack.") Spring produces lavishly its herbaceaus benefits, and " A chapel or a festival // means giving"; among the refugees, on the other hand, herbs are gathered to be sold. The tenuousness of these relationships is, of course, calculated 490 Tuo Kinds of Vision in Marianne Moore</page><page sequence="10">to conceal the poet's feelings. At the point in the poem where she enters King's Chapel, the feeling attached to the plight of the refugees and to her own hope for them finds direct utterance. In the lines quoted above, the words "stranger," "child," and "home" are strongly emotive. But once again in the presence of the danger of sentimentality the poet resorts to the protection of a fanciful series of images-the "black sturgeon-eggs "' etc., which, with the internal rhyme, quickly lead away from the emo- tion aroused in the words named. It would have been quite foreign to Miss Moore's good manners to allow personal senti- ment to dominate a poem which was read at the Boston Arts Festival in 1958. One of the most interesting and complex poems in which the meaning resides in the relationship between the two kinds of vision is " An Octopus." The poem is complex partly because its subject is complex. Its subject is truth and how one may ap- proach it; and as a part of this subject the poem is concerned to show how the general view is attended by happiness while the more penetrating one-the one which will attain to truth- precludes it. The poem has two parts between which the division is indicated. The first part presents, not exclusively, an unfallen world, perceptible by those who look at it with a bird's-eye-view. The second part, again not exclusively, presents the truth as it may be approached and discerned by fallen mortals. These two themes occur also in the two poems which respectively precede and follow " An Octopus " in the Collected Poems and which, as Kenneth Burke has pointed out (A Grammar of Motives, p. 496 f. n.) , are associated with it. In " Marriage," Eden appears in "all its lavishness," while in " Sea Lions and Land Unicorns" truth is imaged as a unicorn with "chain lightning" about its horn,, "impossible to take alive ',,/ tamed only by a lady inoffen- sive like itself. . . ." In "An Octopus," truth is imaged by the glacier, with "the lightning flashing at its base"; and the dis- cipline required in approaching it-largely a matter of being inoffensive is detailed: It is self-evident that it is frightful to have everything afraid of one; A. K. Weatherhead 491</page><page sequence="11">that one must do as one is told and eat rice, prunes, dates, raisins, hardtack, and tomatoes if one would ' conquer the main peak of Mount Tacoma, this fossil flower concise without a shiver. . . . (Collected Poems, p. 83.) The terms one must accept in order to climb are, of course, a metaphor for the self discipline of clear perception and " relentless accuracy" that the poet accepts prior to the discovery and utter- ance of truth in her poetry. The vision of the truth at the end of the poem-a vision not brashly arrogated but earned by the discipline-is a harsh one: the glacier * . . receives one under winds that 'tear the snow to bits and hurl it like a sandblast shearing off twigs and loose bark from the trees.' . . the hard mountain ' planed by ice and polished by the wind '- the white volcano with no weather side; the lightning flashing at its base. . . o The first part of the poem presents on the whole a happy general view punctuated occasionally by uncomfortable glances into the real nature of things. It dwells mostly not upon the glacier itself nor the measures that must be taken to approach it but upon flora and fauna which may be observed in the sur- rounding park. There was, in fact, a ready-made hint for the poet that she should present this as a prelapsarian world, for the park around Mount Tacoma has the name " Paradise " and de- serves it. Some of the perceptions in this romantic part of the poem are reminiscent of the tamed nature of eighteenth century pastoral: " the polite needles of the larches " are " ' hung to filter, not to intercept the sunlight "'; or there are " dumps of gold and silver ore enclosing The Goat's Mirror- / that lady-fingerlike de- pression in the shape of the left human foot. . . ." The anthropomorphic distortion of real nature is extended to the descriptions of the animals: "the exacting porcupine," the rat pausing " to smell the heather," "' thoughtful beavers / making drains which seem the work of careful men with shovels,"' the water ouzel "with 'its passion for rapids,"' and the marmot, a victim of "'a struggle between curiosity and caution"' Among 492 Two Kinds of Vision tin Marianne Moore</page><page sequence="12">these creatures are the guides, presented as parts of the happy animal kingdom, who have withdrawn to this paradise from the complex world of hotels and are therefore safe in sloughing off their protective covering as animals sometimes do: those who 'have lived in hotels but who now live in camps-who prefer to'; the mountain guide evolving from the trapper, 'in two pairs of trousers, the outer one older, wearing slowly away from the feet to the knees.' Enjoyment of this paradise depends upon ignorance and there- fore upon the imperfection of vision. Some of the creatures here are so placed that they have a vantage point from which to view this world; and for the sake of their felicity it is as important that they should not see clearly as that S. Capossela, judging win- ners from his vantage point, should. He is concerned to find truth; his felicity is not under consideration. Similarly, the poet may arrive at truth by her fallen approach; but the animals' happiness is contingent upon their avoiding it. One is reminded of Miss Moore's tendency on encountering animals " to wonder if they are happy." In connection with her descriptions of the goat and the eagles in the park, the poet toys with the word " fall ": to experience the sensation of a fall would be to experience the Fall. But the vision of these animals is suitably vague: on its pedestal the goat has its eye "fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fall." The eagles are perched on places from which humans would fall, but they don't see anything: 'They make a nice appearance, don't they,' happy seeing nothing? Perched on treacherous lava and pumice- those unadjusted chimney-pots and cleavers which stipulate 'names and addresses of persons to notify in case of disaster.' The distinction made earlier between the two parts of the poem as the products respectively of the romantic view and the realistic is only a relative one. The glacier, for instance, notwithstanding the horrendous description at the end of the poem, is referred to earlier in the second part as the " fossil flower "; while in the first A. K. Weatherhead 493</page><page sequence="13">part, the word "misleadingly" in the following description of the glacier gives due warning that it may not be such a docile object as the images from human fabrication suggest: dots of cyclamen-red and maroon on its clearly defined pseudo-podia made of glass that will bend-a much need invention. it hovers forward 'spider fashion on its arms' misleadingly like lace. Some of the difficulty of the poem is due to its lack of recog- nizable form. Form is the product of a process in which all details are selected, shaped and ordered to contribute and conform to the whole. But it is contrary to the characteristic practice of Marianne Moore to subordinate particulars to a general picture; when she does so, it is only to provide a foil for the kind of per- ception which appreciates details. The subordination of particu- lars for the sake of conformity is a practice for which she pours contempt upon the steamroller, to whom details are only inter- esting to the extent that they can be applied to something else: The illustration is nothing to you without the application. You lack half wit. You crush all the particles down into close conformity, and then walk back and forth on them. Sparkling chips of rock are crushed down to the level of the parent block. (Collected Poems, p. 90.) Her policy in "An Octopus" is to present and appreciate the details as they appear-she is not making a map, but engaging in what Ezra Pound called a " periplum," a voyage of discovery which gives, not a bird's-eye-view but a series of images linked by the act of voyaging: "Not as land looks on a map," says Pound, " but as sea bord seen by men sailing." There is, of course, a degree of recognizable order: there is a broad difference be- tween the two parts of the poem. But a too exact structural control would defeat the poet's aim, which is to accommodate fragments which may perhaps give "'piercing glances into the life of things.' A 8'Cf. Mildred Hartsock, "Marianne Moore, 'A Salvo of Barks,"' Bucknell Review, XI (December, 1962), 31-3t. 494 Two Kinds of Vision inr Marianne Moore</page><page sequence="14">This phrase comes from the poem " When I Buy Pictures." The images in Miss Moore's poetry are often presented as pic- tures, sometimes employing the terms of painting; and often the pictures are sentimental. One example is the first view of the town in " The Steeple Jack "; another is the goat in " An Octopus," which, watching the panorama with a romantic gaze, is itself deliberately presented as a sentimental engraving " in stag-at-bay position " like one of Landseer's creations: black feet, eyes, nose, and horns, engraved on dazzling ice-fields, the ermine body on the crystal peak; the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene, dyeing them white upon this antique pedestal. But in the poem concerned with buying pictures, or pretending to own them rather, the poet appears to dislike the kind of picture which is too strongly bent on making a point. She says, " Too stern an intellectual emphasis upon this quality or that detracts from one's enjoyment./ It must not wish to disarm anything; nor may the approved triumph easily be honoured- / that which is great because something else is small" (Collected Poems, p. 55) . One assumes she would prefer Breughel or such paintings of Dtirer as provide the eye with opportunity for play among phe- nomena; just as in her own poetic practice she avoids the strong approach to a central theme, preferring to dwell appreciatively among her images. A picture should be "' lit with piercing glances into the life of things "'; but a glance is not a gaze or the rapacious look of the arrogant man in " A Grave." When one has observed the two kinds of vision in Marianne Moore's poetry and her rejection, generally implicit, of the senti- mental kind, then one may consider her characteristic procedures with detailed percepts as the result of a choice. It is a choice M. Jacques Maritain, for one, apparently regrets. Had Miss Moore elected to exert habitually a less strict control upon her feelings and upon the judgments she offers, we should have had a different kind of poetry giving a different kind of enjoy- ment. "In Distrust of Merits," with its superb close, suggests that if she had chosen to write in, say, the later vein of Dame Sitwell, she would have done so surpassingly: A. K. Weatherhead 495</page><page sequence="15">I inwardly did nothing. 0 Iscariotlike crime! Beauty is everlasting and dust is for a time. (Collected Poems, p. 137.) To meet Miss Moore on her more familiar ground, however, when her feelings and judgments are tightly secured to accurate percep- tions, is to gain no less poetic pleasure than that derived from such good lines as these.
