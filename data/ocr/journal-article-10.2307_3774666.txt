<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fresco Decorations of Luca Giordano in Spain Dawson W. Carr While it is true that the art of fresco painting was never prac- ticed in Spain to the extent it was in Italy, the impression of rarity is exaggerated today because relatively few sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish fresco projects survive. Be- ginning particularly in the reign of Philip ii, when a hitherto ambulatory court settled down, the Spanish Hapsburgs cul- tivated fresco for the embellishment of their palaces and churches. Because the medium was not generally popular among Spanish painters, Italians were often imported by the Spanish kings specifically for their abilities in fresco. During the last half of the seventeenth century there was a brilliant flowering of fresco at the court of Madrid that re- flected the preeminence of large-scale, sceneographic decora- tion at most of the European Baroque courts. Although we will concentrate on a group of frescoes created in the last dec- ade of the seventeenth century, our story really begins in i650 with Velazquez in Italy. In the immediately preceding years, Velazquez and Philip iv had been developing decorative schemes for the most important state rooms in the Alcaizar of Madrid.1 One of the primary purposes of Velazquez's second trip to Italy was to procure the services of a fresco painter to decorate the ceilings of these key rooms.2 The major type of ceiling decoration employed in the first part of the reign of Philip iv had reflected sixteenth-century grotesque decoration introduced to Spain by Italian painters at the Escorial. For instance, the ceiling of the Hall of Realms in the Buen Retiro Palace, executed between I634 and I635, was composed of ornate gilt grotesques surrounding the escutch- eons of the kingdoms of the Spanish monarchy, which gave the hall its name.3 Philip iv was always concerned with the most up-to-date trends in art, and by i65o he did not want this retardataire mode of decoration for the ceilings at the Alcaizar. In one of his let- ters concerning Velazquez's activity in Rome, the king makes it clear that his first choice for a fresco painter is Pietro da Cortona.4 In the preceding decade, Cortona had earned a trans-Eu- ropean reputation as the greatest fresco decorator in Europe. Although Philip could only have known descriptions of such works as the Barberini Ceiling and the series of planetary rooms in the Palazzo Pitti, he nonetheless must have been fas- cinated by the potentials of the Roman Baroque fresco for expressing political power and princely magnificence. When Velazquez approached Cortona in Rome, he was at work on the dome of Santa Maria in Vallicella and about to begin to decorate the long gallery of the Palazzo Pamphili in the Piazza Navonna for Innocent x. With rich opportunities at home, Cortona declined Philip iv's invitation, and it would be another forty years before a Cortonesque style of fresco decoration would be introduced to the Spanish court by Luca Giordano. Velazquez did fulfill the king's directive to secure a fresco painter of reputation, but finally settled on a pair of artists who worked in an entirely different technique from Cortona. Angelo Michele Colonna and Agostino Mitelli were illustri- ous Bolognese quadraturisti or painters of architectural per- spective. True quadratura was a geometrical science that employed perspective devices and carefully controlled optics to create perfectly defined extensions of space with feigned architecture. Colonna and Mitelli arrived in Madrid in I658 and Velaz- quez spent the last two years of his life working with the Ital- ians and the king in decorating the Alcazar and the Buen Retiro palaces. Mitelli died just three days after Velazquez in i66o, and Colonna then continued to work alone until his return to Italy in i66z. Wherever these itinerant artists went, they left a legacy that was to influence fresco decoration well into the next century. Madrid was no exception, but unfortunately not one of their frescoes in Spain has survived, making it im- possible to fully evaluate their Spanish period.5 The only existing work in fresco with which Colonna and Mitelli can be associated is the cupola of the Madrilenian church of San Antonio de los Portugueses (fig. i), which is the earliest extant example of quadratura p, nting in Spain. It follows a basic Colonna/Mitelli scheme of architectural ele- ments telescoping to an opening through which the figures are seen. Although Colonna did studies for the decoration of the church, the frescoes were executed by two Spanish painters, Francisco Rizi and Juan Carrefio de Miranda, who had worked with Colonna and Mitelli in frescoing the Hall of Mirrors of the Alcazar.6 Colonna and Mitelli inspired a mini quadratura school at Madrid. Rizi became an excellent fresco decorator in his own right,7 and he and Carrefio must be credited with passing on the technique to a younger generation of Spanish painters, especially Claudio Coello and Jose Jimenez Donoso. Unfor- tunately, the vast majority of the works of this little school of fresco painting has been lost and those that remain have been heavily restored. From the available evidence it seems that quadratura was rather consistently applied in the decoration of ceilings and domes by Spanish painters and that true Cor- regesque illusionism had not yet been introduced in Spain. The remnants of Coello's and Donoso's frescoes of i672 in the Casa de la Panaderia (Madrid, Plaza Mayor) illustrate that the tradition of quadratura was still going strong ten years after Colonna returned to Italy.8 42</page><page sequence="2">Figure i. Angelo Michele Colonna, Francisco Rizi, Juan Carrefno de Miranda, and Luca Giordano, Vision of St. Anthony, Madrid, San Antonio de los Alemanes (or de los Portugueses) By the time Giordano was called to Spain, Claudio Coello was the only outstanding fresco painter left in Madrid. He was to die a year after Giordano's arrival amid rumors that grief or envy resulting from Giordano's success had killed him. The king had complained that Coello was too slow and what he got in Giordano was a painter of legendary speed. He was nicknamed Luca Fa Presto and his output is one of the largest in the entire history of art. There are, in fact, several thousand paintings catalogued as by him.9 As Yves Bottineau has demonstrated, Giordano had been known in Spain for a good many years through his easel paint- ings.10 Carlo Ceci, a minor biographer of the artist before i68i, relates that Giordano, as a Neapolitan subject of the king of Spain, had been called twice by Philip iv, but both times the painter declined citing pressing affairs at home."1 Recently discovered documents make clear the exact cir- cumstances that would bring Giordano to the Spanish court as he approached his sixtieth year.12 He was essentially blackmailed into service. Giordano himself set the process in motion when in I690 he petitioned the king for a continua- tion of his son's position in the government of Naples. The king agreed to aid the son, but only if the father would serve him in Spain. Giordano, perhaps pressured by some sense of familial duty, and certainly with the outlook of a Neapolitan entrepreneur, decided to obey his king's order. Once on the job, the artist turned the table on the king and by the time he returned to Naples, he had won numerous privileges for him- self, his family, and his assistants. He even managed to obtain a position in the Neapolitan government for his father-in- law, who was a well-known smuggler in the kingdom. 43</page><page sequence="3">Figure z. Luca Giordano, Adoration of the Trinity, El Es- corial, Imperial Staircase Although Giordano's easel paintings had been known to the court for some years, Palomino tells us that he was spe- cifically called to Madrid for his abilities in fresco.13 In the decade before his Spanish trip, Giordano had earned a pre- eminent reputation as a fresco decorator in Florence with the cupola of the Corsini Chapel in Sta. Maria del Carmine and the vault of the Galleria Riccardiana in the Palazzo Medici- Riccardi. His legendary speed of execution was well suited to the art of fresco, which required a quick, sure hand. Similarly, Giordano was a genius at creating decorations that made the most of existing sites. In Spain, Giordano was given the opportunity to display his dazzling ability at fresco decoration more than at any other time in his career. He created seven major fresco projects during the ten-year period, while producing hundreds, if not thousands, of easel paintings. All of Giordano's frescoes in Spain were royal commissions, which afford a look at the pre- occupations of the last of the Spanish Hapsburgs just as the dynasty was about to die out. The Papal Nuncio in Madrid reported before Giordano's arrival there in May of i69z that he had been called especially with the idea of creating frescoes for the Escorial.14 In the suc- ceeding two years, Giordano displayed his fa prestismo as never before by frescoing the Imperial Staircase and ten vaults in the church. The Escorial frescoes are the largest conjunc- tion of his work in the medium, and in genetal they are in the best condition of any seventeenth-century frescoes in Spain. That Giordano should have been brought to Spain to add fresco decorations to the Escorial is curious in retrospect. Gi- ordano's light, airy paintings seem anachronisms against Herrera's massive, severe architecture, and many believe the frescoes to be unfortunate intrusions. Obviously, the king and his advisors had no qualms about putting them up. Although the last stone was formally laid at the Escorial in 1584, the decoration of the building continued into the seven- teenth century. The heart of the edifice, its pantheon, was not completed until the mid-i65os under Philip iv. Charles ii shared the affection of his predecessors for the Escorial. He was known as the re-builder of the great edifice after the di- sastrous day-long fire in I671, and further enriched the site with the altar of La Sagrada Forma, completed in I690. Gior- dano's frescoes must be considered within the continuous Hapsburg tradition of enhancing and maintaining the struc- ture that was at the core of family ideology. Giordano's Escorial frescoes are the only large-scale deco- rative project of the seventeenth century in Spain for which we have a written program and substantial documentation.15 These historical records are a testament to the consummate thought and care with which Giordano's frescoes were added to the building. The program was primarily forged by Padre Francisco de los Santos, one of the outstanding intellectuals of the Hieronymite community at the Escorial, and the author of one of the major descriptive volumes on the monastery.16 Padre de los Santos was not alone in developing the program of the frescoes; Giordano's experience was always taken into consideration and Charles ii at times intervened in the planning of the scheme. Giordano's first task at the Escorial was the decoration of its principal staircase (fig. z), which Charles ii ordered should represent the motives behind the foundation of the Escorial. This purpose is furthered by a series of fictive tapestries painted as if hung at the top of each of the four walls just below the windows. Three of the tapestries depict episodes from the Battle of St. Quentin, which was the first victory of the reign of Philip ii. The victory occurred on the feast day of St. Law- rence and prompted the king to make a votive promise to the saint, which was fulfilled in building the Escorial. The tapes- try of the fourth wall shows the prudent king overseeing the construction of the building. Above, Giordano breaks open the vault in a resplendent heavenly vision. Giordano's ceiling actually suggests that the staircase is not covered at all. A feigned balustrade peeks through the clouds around the room as if an open walkway circumscribed the stairwell. On the principal side, visible as one begins to ascend or descend the stairs, we see the current royal family: the Queen Mother, Mariana of Austria, in her nun's habit; Mariana of Neuberg, the reigning queen; and Charles ii who indicates the celestial happening that has ap- peared in the sky. The vision hovering above the stairs is an adoration of the Trinity by the heavenly host, including the founders of the House of Austria in Spain. Charles v and Philip ii are located just below and to the right of the Trinity, offering their crowns and kingdoms to the Triune God. The source of this image is not mentioned in Padre de los Santos's program or in any of the subsequent literature on the ceiling, perhaps be- cause it is so obvious. The central part of the ceiling is, in fact, a Baroque amplification of one of the key visual images from the golden age of Hapsburg iconography: Titian's Gloria in the Prado (fig. 3). The Gloria was painted for Charles v in the early i55os and on the right side represents his family praying before the Trinity. This was the painting that the emperor held most dear. He took it with him into retirement at the monastery of 44</page><page sequence="4">A r N / '1 \ ¼fe s ".. X . ** '. * I 4t . r I iF Al I I A I... .

Luca Giordano, Last Judgment, El Escorial, Church Yuste and was said to have been gazing at it when he died. In a codicil to his will, the emperor requested his son, Philip in, to have the composition rendered in alabaster and placed over his tomb if he were buried at Yuste.17 Of course, Yuste was not his final resting place. The Escorial became the site of the pantheon of the Spanish kings and in a sense Giordano's fresco represents the ultimate fulfillment of the emperor's wish. Giordano does not reproduce Titian's painting on the vault. Rather, the highly esoteric iconography of Titian's pic- ture is adjusted to take account of the events of the intervening century and a half. When the picture by Titian was painted, Charles and Philip were still alive and were depicted humbly shrouded before the Trinity. In Giordano's fresco, they are clad in sumptous royal robes. Charles v offers the Trinity the crowns of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain as Philip ii offers up the world. Just above Charles and Philip are royal saints of the House of Austria and Spain, although placed on a higher level than their un-canonized descendants. In the Gloria, guardian angels present the royal family to the Trinity, but in the Giordano they are recommended by St. Jerome, dressed as a cardinal, who intercedes for the Spanish kings for the special favor they showed to the Hieronymite order, particu- larly at the Escorial. Similarly, the Virgin and St. Lawrence, as co-patrons of the Escorial, act as intercessors. Kneeling before the Trinity and offering their kingdoms as credentials at personal judgment, the two great Hapsburg kings are represented at the threshold of heaven. In this way the ceiling is tied to one of the Escorial's fundamental pur- poses: a royal pantheon and site for continuous prayer for the souls of the Spanish kings and, the patron-king Charles II offers us the example of the devotion, piety, and achievement of his most illustrious ancestors and the founding fathers of the dynasty. The last Hapsburg pays homage to the first and with this ceiling seeks to elaborate on the ideals and traditions es- tablished by his forefathers. The king was delighted with Giordano's work on the stair- case, and after this initial test he was set to work on decorat- ing the church of the Escorial. The king and his advisors were very cautious as they proceeded with the enterprise. No de- finitive program was prepared before work began, but rather it evolved as the work progressed. There is nothing revolu- tionary about its iconography: the themes selected might have been placed there a century before during the initial decorative campaign. The caution with which the decoration of the church was approached is evident in that Giordano was to begin with the vaults of the side aisles. These four vaults correspond to four principal reliquary altars established by Philip ii. It was only once these vaults were completed that it was decided to con- tinue with the more extensive and visible vaults of the main crossing. In the vault before the high altar, Giordano painted the Dormition and Transit of the Virgin (fig. 4). Padre de los San- tos informs us that it was to complement Federico Zuccaro's Assumption of the Virgin in the high altar and Luca Cam- biaso's fresco of the Coronation of the Virgin in the adjacent vault. The church of the Escorial was dedicated to the Virgin in addition to St. Lawrence, and Padre de los Santos stresses the special favor that she bestowed on the Spanish military in battle. Directly opposite is Giordano's fresco of the Last Judg- ment (fig. 5), in its traditional place at the entrance of the church. We see Christ the Judge with the sickle to separate the blessed on his right from the damned on his left. The fres- coes are difficult to appreciate in the static state of a photo- graph; they are conceived according to paths of access and they are engaging no matter how you approach them in the church. This one can be approached from all four sides and it is interesting to note that the inverted Apocalyptic Cross rights itself for the viewer coming from the altar. The vault in the north arm of the Greek cross depicts the 46</page><page sequence="6">-I</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Luca Giordano, Passage of the Israelites over the Red Sea, El Escorial, Church Passage of the Israelites over the Red Sea (fig. 6) where a col- orful caravan of men and beasts runs over the architecture and around the vault. This theme exemplifies God's favor for his chosen people in the face of overwhelming adversity and his wrath against those who do not follow him. Moses directs his rod across the vault to the Red Sea as God sends out armed archangels to smite the troops of Pharoah, which are swal- lowed up by the waters of the Red Sea amid dramatic light- ening. The theme of God's protection of his chosen people is con- tinued in the vault of the south arm, across the main aisle from the Passage. The Battle of the Israelites and the Amalekites (fig. 7) is more specifically apposite to the Escorial because it depicts the first military victory of the Israelites after crossing the Red Sea, just as St. Quentin was Philip's first victory. More importantly, following the battle Moses erected an al- tar in the desert, which naturally alluded to the desolate site of the Escorial. Another parallel with the Escorial is found in the upper left corner where Moses lifts his arms in supplica- tion aided by Aaron and Hus. Moses discovered that when his arms were raised in oration the Israelites prevailed, but when he lowered them, then the Amalekites reversed the trend. This Biblical passage was, of course, taken literally by Philip ii who ordered prayers around the clock in the monastery for the protection of Spain and the preservation of the faith. Giordano was known for his abilities to arrange figures in violent motion and this battle scene is a tour de force of or- ganized confusion. As the battle surges across the vault Gior- dano achieves some of his most dramatic di sotto in su work as horses and riders tumble over a precipice and out of the vault. Although the Escorial was a century old by this time, the decorations put up by Charles ii attest to the continuity of Hapsburg thought and iconography. The frescoes were not 48</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7. Luca Giordano, Battle of the Israelites and Ama- lekites, El Escorial, Church haphazardly and thoughtlessly executed but rather carefully designed to reflect the ideology behind, and function of the building. The impetus to add Giordano's decorations to the Escorial probably came from the king. Painted when Charles was still without an heir and almost without hope of ever having one, Giordano's frescoes seek to recall the glories of Hapsburg his- tory as the dynasty appeared to be coming to an end. Charles ii was probably responsible for the other religious frescoes painted by Luca Giordano in Spain. The king was known for his exaggerated piety and, in addition, had specific reasons for commissioning two of Giordano's frescoes. By the mid-i69os, his always-frail health was deteriorating. Yet the king who had not been expected to survive childhood was twice-more saved from death. To express his thanks for these new leases on life, Charles ordered votive frescoes to be painted in Toledo and Madrid. In the spring of I698, the king called Giordano to Toledo to add a fresco to the Cathedral sacristy, which had just been given a new vault by the Chapter. The fresco principally rep- resents the quintessential Toledan subject, the Bestowal of the Chasuble on St. Ildefonsus (fig. 8). Ildefonsus was a seventh- century archbishop of Toledo who was particularly known for his writings on the purity of the Virgin. After his death, a leg- end arose that the Virgin had come down from heaven to be- stow the chasuble, the symbol of the archbishopric, on her devoted servant. This fresco is part of a long tradition of royal patronage of the cathedral primate of Spain, but it also represented some- thing more personal for the king. The year before Giordano painted the fresco dedicated primarily to St. Ildefonsus, the king had been gravely ill. After the usual efforts to cure him by holy images and saints' relics found in Madrid had failed, the relics of St. Ildefonsus were paraded in Zamora, where they 49</page><page sequence="9">I ;,,E 4.I J .' _ _ \, 3 ;;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .

Giordano was also commissioned to fresco the royal chapel of Santa Maria de Atocha, probably in thanks for the king's health. The Virgin of Atocha was an image whose aid was constantly invoked for the health of the king. Unfortunately the church of Atocha, which also contained major frescoes by Rizi, has been destroyed. A commission of a more personal nature was the Church of San Antonio de los Alemanes (fig. 9). We have already seen Rizi's and Carreiio's cupola under the name San Antonio de los Portugueses in figure i. San Antonio was founded by royal order in I604 as a church and hospital for Portuguese subjects at the court,19 We must remember that Portugal had been an- nexed by Spain in I580 and that St. Anthony was not a native Paduan, but Portuguese by birth. In i668, Spain lost Portugal after a long and costly war. Then in I689, the queen mother, Mariana of Austria, decided to rededicate the church to Ger- man pilgrims at the court. It was henceforth known as San Antonio de los Alemanes. The following year, I690, a major repair and redecorating campaign was begun. After the queen mother's "good" death six years later, Figure 9. Luca Giordano, Miracles of St. Anthony, Madrid, San Antonio de los Alemanes Charles ii (whose ambivalent relationship with his mother is well known) decided to complete the decoration of the church which his mother had begun. Giordano created a series of eight fictive tapestries around the church, each with a miracle of St. Anthony. The tapestries were borne by putti and angels and beneath each panel the royal status of the church is denoted by royal saints. In an age when large scale, mythological fresco decoration was being created in palaces all over Europe, Giordano re- ceived only one "secular" commission from Charles ii. In the king's principal palace in Madrid, the Alcazar, the major state- rooms had already been done, and there Giordano would add frescoes only to the new cupola of the royal chapel. But across Madrid, at the Buen Retiro Palace, there was a large ceiling in the Cas6n that Giordano was ordered to paint (figs. io and II). The Cas6n was designed by Alonso Carbonell and con- structed in I637 to add a ballroom to the pleasure palace com- plex.20 It is one of only two portions of the palace that sur- vive, although entirely remodelled in the nineteenth century. Giordano's ceiling fresco is by far his largest, measuring ap- proximately zi by I3 meters, and it is unfortunate that it is not in good condition. The ceiling was restored at least twice 51</page><page sequence="11">Figure io. Luca Giordano, Allegory of the Order of the Golden Fleece, Madrid, Cas6n del Buen Retiro ¾^_ r.N Hit . . u 2J '-.

The work has probably been seen by more people in the last six months than in its whole previous history because Picasso's Guernica is now installed beneath it. The fresco celebrates the foundation of the Order of the Golden Fleece.21 The order had become inextricably tied to Spanish royal ideology with the advent of the Hapsburgs, who ruled the elite group of princes as grand masters. The birth of the order was conveyed allegorically: at the east end of the hall (fig. io), which one faced as one entered the room, we see Jason consigning the Golden Fleece to the founder of the or- der, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, who was Charles ii's uncle seven times removed. The Duke is about to attach the fleece to a super-collar, which is borne by personifications of the kingdoms of Spain. The conjunction of these personifica- tions wearing heraldic robes with the chain of the Golden Fleece, which circumscribes them and the crown above them, creates a grandiose, anthropomorphic representation of the coat-of-arms of the Spanish monarchy, echoing Cortona's creation of the Barberini stemma in the Glorification of Urban VIII (Rome, Palazzo Barberini). The sun shines through the crown to illuminate the king- doms below, perhaps evoking the world-wide Spanish empire, on which the sun never set. Above-the crown, looming in the center of the ceiling, is a celestial globe with the astral projec- tion for January io, I430, the date of the foundation of the order. On top of the globe are the gods on Olympus with Ju- piter sending his eagle to bestow a laurel wreath on Philip the Good. Philip's purpose in founding the order is represented to the left and right of the conveyance of the Fleece. To the left, Pallas Athena overcomes the Titans, which is an allegory of the defense of the faith. To the right, Hercules fights Antaeus as the Conqueror of Discord. The order was conceived by Philip the Good in the chivalric spirit of the age of the Cru- sades when the enemy was Islam, but its direction was later easily adapted to combat the Protestant heresy of the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries. In the i69os the Turks were again on the move against the northern branch of the Haps- burg family. Philip's purpose in choosing the Golden Fleece as the symbol of his order was based on the contemporary idea that the quest of Jason and the Argonauts was an alle- gory of Christ procuring salvation for mankind, just as the Hapsburgs believed they were doing in the religious wars.22 At the opposite end of the room (fig. i ) is a matron, iden- tified by Palomino as the Regal Majesty of the Spanish Mon- archy, who sits on top of a terrestrial globe with captives of various ethnic types and the dragon of heresy at her feet.23 Along the side walls, Giordano used the balustrade motif he had employed in the Escorial staircase. Above it, on both sides is an airbom procession of benevolent gods and personi- fications proceeding from the scene of the foundation of the order and the defense of the heavens toward the personifica- tion of Spain at the opposite end. The message of the ceiling is that the principles of the or- der, brought to Spain by the Hapsburgs, were responsible for the prosperity and preeminence that Spain had enjoyed. This is, of course, ironic considering the state of the monarchy. Perhaps the last Spanish Hapsburg took some comfort in the example of Philip the Good who also died without issue, but whose institution had long survived him. The theme of the virtue and strength of the monarchy was continued on the walls below where Giordano frescoed epi- sodes from the life of Hercules on the walls as fictive tapestries (now lost). Hercules was commonly identified with the king of Spain, and appears as the ancestor of the line in the series of paintings for the Hall of Realms in the north wing of the Retiro. Hercules was said to have fathered both the ruling houses in Spain and Burgundy giving the Spanish Hapsburgs a double dose of his virtue. His presence in this ensemble is particularly appropriate because he was not only one of the Argonauts, but also frequently appeared in the sixteenth cen- tury as the symbol of the prince conquering discord.24 In preparation for the main subject of the room, Giordano frescoed an antechamber (now destroyed) that contained scenes from the Reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors, illustrating the defense of the faith by Spanish kings before the advent of the Hapsburgs and the Order of the Golden Fleece. While the Hall of Realms specifically glorified the achieve- ments of Philip iv, the Cason stresses the Hapsburg ideals of chivalry, princely virtue, and the defense of the faith. It was perhaps kept general in conception because of the tenuous state of the Spanish succession. In fact, the Spanish Hapsburg dynasty did end with Charles ii and it was beneath Giordano's ceiling that the first Bourbon king of Spain, Philip v, was received by Cardinal Portocarrero and the court upon his arrival in Spain. Several weeks later the new king was installed as Grand Master of the Order of the Golden Fleece in this most appropriate of settings.25 Very impressed with Giordano's work, Philip v tried to persuade him to go to France to work for his uncle, Louis xiv, but Gi- ordano, approaching seventy years of age, declined and left for Naples early in I702. During Giordano's ten years in Spain, it was obvious to al- 54</page><page sequence="14">most everyone that the Hapsburg dynasty was about to die out. While his exuberant frescoes were being created, Haps- burg Spain was moribund. It is perhaps for this reason that the character of Giordano's principal decorations is retro- spective. The Escorial staircase and the Cason ceiling celebrate the foundations and ideals of great Hapsburg institutions- recollections of the golden age of the Hapsburgs in Spain. The one passionate obsession of Charles II was to pass on intact his dominions, along with their institutions and politi- cal ideas, but this was at best an uncertain prospect. At the time when extinction of the dynasty seemed inevitable, the last of the Spanish Hapsburgs turned to the family's preferred means of expression to insure their remembrance. After all, kings are only mortal, while the art of painting is truly lasting. Notes I am currently preparing a doctoral dissertation on this subject with Jonathan Brown at the Institute of Fine Arts.
