<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTS AND LETTERS A MODERNIST LEXICON WYLIE SYPHER It is ironic how, having been so ably instructed by semiotics to distrust language as a trap, we should have been so continually anxious to use a precise term for what lacks a local habitation and a name: for what is variously called contemporary, modern, modernist, modernity, modern ism, postmodern, posthumanist, poststructuralist, and (with Continental overtones) avant-garde, post-avant-garde, or neo-avant-garde. Admit tedly the idea of the avant-garde inheres in the modern; but the modern suffers from a paradoxical anachronism implicit in the title of Harry Levin's "What Was Modernism?" (1966). A difficult question, since T. S. Eliot is avant-garde in his poetic technique but very traditional in temper. The dispute about what the modern is (or was) became agitated after Renato Poggioli's Theory of the Avant-Garde (1968), which made the avant-garde accessory to modernity. Amid a torrent of definitions John Weightman in Concept of the Avant-Garde (1973) was still lamenting the loss of intelligibility in the moderns?although admitting that we need new methods and themes in contemporary writing. The contem porary is taken as a thoughtless compliance about current fashion; mod ernism requires, instead, at least a degree of self-awareness?or a concern about one's relation to past, present, or future.

(Wordsworth felt this kind of alienation when in a modernist moment he knew he was not for his time and his place.) The vanguard artist is often estranged from his society by his vision of the future, that future being much more than a mere intensification of the present. The avant-garde artists can be grouped roughly in three clusters (sometimes overlapping): the aesthetes who attempt to exploit their medium at its extremes (Joyce, Proust, the "new" novelists); the visionaries who are attracted to worlds elsewhere (Blake, Shelley, at times T. S. Eliot); the activists and rebels who are committed to political change as an instrument (William Morris, Pound, Brecht). By his very title, Poets, Prophets, and Revolutionaries, Charles Russell identifies and summarizes the directions of the avant-garde during the last century while romantic subjectivity became a confused insurgence against a philistine society. Russell refuses to search for a more precise glossary, resting with his "working definition" of the avant-garde as a subsidiary or attendant response to a new urban and industrial order. In finding the term avant-garde undiscriminating, Russell places himself among the rare historians who can put a vague term to exact use. His tempered study serves as a scale for appraising the many more excitable views of the avant-garde. In his final chapter Russell dismisses concern about the meaning(s) of the postmodern as differing from high modernism: he finds that the "new" French criticism is an overcerebral attention to language itself. Such exercises in discourse-making statements about discourse become tautological and self-referential improvisations. So the neo-avant-garde makes gestures where signifier and signified are the same and language becomes a solipsism confining the writer in his own discourse. This formalism in recent fiction looks to Russell like a betrayal of the avant garde, for Russell is averse to any methodology or ideology as a doctri naire restriction able to overthrow vision, as socialist realism finally withered Mayakovsky's talent. Other questions about the avant-garde are raised in Faces of Modern ism by Matei Calinescu (1977), who accepts Poggioli's "absolute prin ciple that the true bourgeois art is inevitably anti-bourgeois." Calinescu sees how the avant-garde alienation breeds both decadence and Kitsch. The sensitivity of Baudelaire leads him to press his medium to a nearly pathological appreciation of flowers of Evil. The permissiveness of the bohemian can recoil upon itself in a sterility limited to a parody of the bourgeois or a self-criticism of novelists who can write only about the writing of novels. (Charles Newman, writing in Salmagundi, considers</page><page sequence="3">ARTS AND LETTERS 499 this self-indulgence a cynicism and indifference that can corrupt an avant-garde rebellion.) Beyond the integrity of the avant-garde is the danger of Kitsch, which debases the vision Russell calls prophetic. Regarding the poet as prophet, Trotsky affirms the same anachronism as Shelley: Shelley sees the future in the present; Trotsky thinks of poetry as a permanent revolu tion, for the only poetry of the revolution is prerevolutionary avant-garde poetry. This anachronism brings its own double irony: the poet can be ignored or rejected by the politics of actual history; or, worse, if the poet is accepted by society, the avant-garde loses its alien status and disappears within a conformity making his revolt superfluous. The avant garde can (and sometimes does) eat up itself, being obliterated within the history which it rejects. Unable to leap to a world elsewhere, the vanguard artist becomes obsolescent in a present that absorbs and an nuls the future. He is victim of what Baudelaire called the poncif (the tranquilizing platitudes and clich?s of the majority). Ezra Pound was the demolition specialist for the avant-garde in urging Make it new. The new is often the unintelligible or offensive that becomes intel ligible and even amenable when explicated in the diluted form of Kitsch?the easy, fashionable, compliant accommodation of the unex pected to the expectation and comprehension of the ordinary mind. Kitsch becomes problematic whenever the modernist feels it advisable to concede to a conforming public. What looks feverish or freakish in the avant-garde can be sanitized by tactics of a mild deconstruction. The question is basically ethical, and after reviewing the often-cryptic avant garde fiction, Russell concludes: "No longer able to present itself as a separate form of meaning and value either within society or in opposi tion to it, post-modern literature offers itself as a paradigm of a ques tioning process without answers." The earlier avant-garde were aesthetes and visionaries, and they were disturbed by being alienated; the so-called postmoderns seem to find (until lately) their aesthetic in an impersonal and value-free tradition of the Russian formalism, which stressed lan guage above reference. The Russian formalists, stressing literature as primarily language, opened anew a question already posed by John Ruskin in The Two Paths: whether art is abstract design or mimesis, representing things ?conceptual or sensational. In The Matrix of Modernism Sanford Schwartz uses this opposition of "the conceptual and immediate ex perience" to show in a well-focused discussion how this persistent prob lem becomes context for the seeming contradictions in two giant mod erns, Eliot and Pound. In dealing with this tantalizing polarity (which reappears in other modernists, in philosophy and science, in Nietzsche,</page><page sequence="4">500 ARTS AND LETTERS William James, Bergson, Bradley, Whitehead, Gourmont, Husserl), Schwartz makes no attempt to define the term modernism beyond link ing it with the "old" New Criticism of Anglo-American figures like I. A. Richards, William Empson, Brooks and Warren, and those critics who precede our semiotics and deconstructions and decentering (the post moderns). But this very limitation directs Schwartz to account for the paradoxical thought of Hulme as examined by Michael H. Levenson in A Genealogy of Modernism. Schwartz throws penetrating new light on the baffling revisions in Eliot's incompatible ideas on impersonal poetry, objective correlatives, emotions and feelings, subjective and objective, and what Schwartz calls Eliot's "half objects" seen in double perspective like the cubist montage existing between the abstract and the object immediately sensed. Pound's montage of past and present is similar to such half-objects, and the haiku in imagism appears in the Vortex of passion and ideas. Schwartz entirely justifies Reed Way Dasenbrock's view that Vorticism is as significant for poetry as for painting. The "arrest of motion" in Wyndham Lewis's painting is a refusal of anthropomorphic time, a translation to the cerebral. In the full matrix of modern thought Schwartz sees why Eliot rejected the Victorian sense of continuity: between author and text, text and the world; then after the impact of Russian formalism the accent shifted to the signifier instead of the signified, the medium, not the message. Eliot was sensitive to these fragmentations and sought in Donne and the metaphysicals an appetite for an intensity, instead of the harmony, in human experience. Unlike Schwartz's self-imposed restraint in focusing on only Eliot and Pound, Frederick R. Karl's Modern and Modernism is an encyclopedic but sometimes undiscriminated survey of modern arts and thought: music, painting, philosophy, poetry, linguistics, fiction, psychology, "cul ture" from 1885 to 1925?years when the artist attained "sovereignty." But Karl well knows that any artistic conquest was gained (if at all) by severe costs: for Baudelaire and Rimbaud; with a nearly pathological decadence in Jarry, Klimt, Strindberg, Huysmans, and heirs of the perilous Sade and Nietzsche; and through the romantic agonies of the bohemian shamans. Nor was modernism a coherent "movement" but a series (hardly a sequence) of very personal versions of a death wish, that symptom of revolt against a philistine society. Yet these modernists were not always anarchic or defiant of authority. Matthew Arnold was not defiant of authority but was modernist in his very respect for tradition, precedent, history, and the canons of an establishment. Arnold is closer to Eliot's quest for dramatic language than to Mallarm?'s defiant use of neologisms like "ptyx." And Pound was a rebel working within tradition.</page><page sequence="5">ARTS AND LETTERS 501 Karl says that we cannot separate modern from postmodern because we cannot locate where a break occurs. Yet his last chapters on the awarding of the Bollingen prize to the demented and convicted Ezra Pound chart a deep crisis and a rupture in modernist aesthetic: Can we justify this award by Pound's command of his medium? An anguishing question. Like other moderns Karl has to leap beyond any avant-garde aesthetic about the medium to an ethical (almost a Socratic) assumption that "the sole responsibility of the artist is to himself." Any difference between modern and postmodern may, after all, depend on a certain moral gravity (and some British values like responsibility, duty, puritan individualism, existential authenticity?). This British ethic tempered the modernist arts, making the English avant-garde far less dogmatic and programmatic than the French post impressionists, the dadaists, the surrealists, the cubists and futurists. In the cloudy development of Vorticism and Imagism dominated by Hulme and Wyndham Lewis and supported by painters like Bomberg, Gaudier Brzeska, and Lewis himself, Dasenbrock places English modernism on a borderline between abstraction and realism. He persuasively argues that Vorticism was a literary episode and that Pound employed montage in poetry as cubists did in painting. Lewis also employed an "affective formalism" resembling montage in a kind of straddling between con ceptual order and realist representation. His compromised (or multiple) vision was tolerant of the "oppositions, disproportions, and asymmetries" that Levenson traces in the English modernism of Hulme, Eliot, Pound, and F. M. Ford?a group who never fully endorsed Marinetti's futurist ideology but held to a pragmatism of immediate experience that was fragmented but never fauvist in its anarchy. The fragmentation of experience is why Ricardo J. Qui?ones in Map ping Literary Modernism distinguishes the difference between the ro mantic time-sense that was "horizontal" and the modern "vertical" re quiring a leap from one level of experience to another, as Eliot found in Donne. Eliot believes that our fragmentation is a sickness from which we have never recovered, and Eliot is impelled to his quest for some still point to heal our own modern dissociation of sensibility. So Eliot is a double man?avant-garde aesthete in exploiting his medium, but traditionalist as thinker and Christian seeking serenity beyond the secu lar. Eliot's duplicity raises questions about his need to legitimate the authority by which he writes, not about his own integrity as modern. This modern need for legitimacy derived from authority is the axis of Mark Conroy's Modernism and Authority as he locates the "strategy" by which Flaubert and Conrad seek to authenticate their fictions. This quest for authentication is vital to those who write for what may be a phantom audience in any commercial market. With some impacted</page><page sequence="6">502 ARTS AND LETTERS clinical phrasing Conroy is able to conclude that the novelist can au thenticate his fiction only by authority of a reading public able to trans form his intentions. An audience has its own cognitions, and readers may mistake Conrad's stories of the British merchant marine for satires on imperialism: Flaubert's intent to write a novel about nothing may be read as a mere self-referential jest. Conroy advises the avant-garde novel ist to forbear all "literariness"?that is, writing fiction about the writing of fiction. For when or if the logic of narrative is deflected by the cogni tion of an unfamiliar audience, Conrad's very creation of Marlow as ethical interpreter may turn back on itself in readers sensitive to aesthetic strategy. Actually Conroy is only modernizing Coleridge's asking for willing suspension of disbelief. He realizes that no game of "literariness" can reduce the tension between author and reader by aesthetic involve ment of the reader alone. When Oscar Wilde jested that he lived in terror of being understood, he was really supporting Conroy's conviction that the modern author must accept the risk of dissociation between author and reader?if only because "what a work does is more vital than what it knows." This state ment not only justifies various deconstructions, but also is a premise to avant-garde art and a triumph for any modern textual analysis operating beyond the old Anglo-American "new" criticism. To evade the danger of being misunderstood is to misunderstand the legitimation needed to establish a text. In spite of modern insecurity, contradictions, ambigui ties, and rival plural meanings and the equivocations in an author's text or a reader's text, we can still tell a story. Conroy's modernist posture is an unexpected heroism quite in key with the rigors of hermeneutics and the severe French semiotics. Writing like so many modernists under the stimulus of Nietzsche, Margot Norris (in Beasts of the Modern Imagination) is convinced that we must reexamine the legitimacy of our humanism, which is only a parody of Darwinian struggle for survival and of the dionysiac intoxica tion. We must see man as does D. H. Lawrence, or as do surrealists like Max Ernst or Kafka?against a biocentric horizon that denies man his special status apart from animals. In a modern natural piety Norris seems to regress to primitivism; but her organic sensibility lacks Words worthian pantheism. Her scathing rejection of Hemingway's ethic of the bullring?a falsification of both Nietzsche and Darwin?suggests a dis tinction between the modern and a callous postmodernism marked by Hemingway's ludic ego. If we do wish to distinguish postmodern from modern, we must reckon with twenty-four essays in a powerful anthology entitled Modernism, Criticism, Realism devoted to the still-debated problem of formalism (abstraction) vs. realism (representation) in the arts: a debate begun</page><page sequence="7">ARTS AND LETTERS 503 by Ruskin and revived by Clement Greenberg's promoting the two dimensional compositions in Russian formalist painting (continued in minimal art refusing naturalist figuration). The anthology is written by a British group known simply as "Art &amp; Language": they publish anony mously to offer "alternative" contexts for modern arts?alternatives that include comment upon techniques of representation in view of our cur rent linguistics (semiotics), structuralism, Chomsky's deep grammar, speculations by the "new" French critics like Lacan, Foucault, and L?vi-Strauss, and psychologists experimenting in different modes of perception. It is heartening to see how this collection makes an unargued assumption that any work of art inevitably has a "cognitive" element? an element that exceeds its aesthetic value. These cognitive elements extend well beyond realism?especially socialist realism. The cognitive surplus value is regulated by a "grammar of reason," and the collection closes with Chomsky's Kantian confidence that man's mind has a grid of designs making language accessible (repeatedly these essays confirm the significance of language as medium for every art). The editors are skeptical about the existence of postmodernism, though this anthology is like some avant-garde declaration of indepen dence for plural meanings (including the social meanings so vulgarized by official Marxism). The essayists insist on the inadequacy of "closed" (orthodox and programmatic) interpretations and ask for "open" criti cism allowing for alternative, or even contradictory, readings. Rooted in the semiotics of critics like Barthes, Derrida, and Althusser, this an thology is poststructural in its open alternatives. In the background is a postulate that the human mind is not a mere tabula rasa but a faculty and a terrain for constructing as well as deconstructing cognitions. These essays suggest that the range of legitimate interpretations of a text may generate realizations that art alone can offer. The acceptance of both formalism and representation may indicate the arrival of a neo-avant garde. At least the earnestness, range, and competence of these essays belie the fear that indifference, indecision, and mere narcissist self-reference are to be expected from postmodernists. The avant-garde proclaiming the death of the author and the primacy of the text alone may be a transient phase in the modernism of Art &amp; Language, which would ap pear to turn from the irresponsibility of so-called postmodernists to the sobriety of an earlier high modernism.</page></plain_text>
