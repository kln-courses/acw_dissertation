<plain_text><page sequence="1">RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DE- SIGN, Museum of Art, 224 Benefit Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903. Fantastic Illustration and Design in Britain , 1850-1930 by Diana L. Johnson greatly ex- tends a 1972 exhibition she organized of prints and drawings by Victorian and Ed- wardian illustrators in the RISD Collection. The current exhibition includes more than 230 works - prints, drawings, paintings, decorative objects, and furniture - from 45 public and private collections. Its subject is more directly fantasy, but, as Diana Johnson explains in her catalogue essay, fantasy can be broadly defined as "the. concept of a 'counter- world' to reality where, to quote Milton, 'time and place are lost.'" She then discusses such precursors to Victorian illus- tration as William Blake, Henry Fuseli, and the 18th-century caricaturists, probes the Victorians' need for . escape from Victorian repression, analyzes their use of contem- porary advances in printing, and touches on the diverse interests of such key illustrators as Aubrey Beardsley, William De Morgan, Ed- mund Dulac, Arthur Rackham, John Ten- niel, etc. The second essay is most unusual for an art- museum catalogue. By George P. Landow, professor of English at Brown University, it offers a parallel discussion of fantasy in literature, not so much the works on exhibition as literature with fantasy as subject, with Landow seeking to define the place of fantasy in both arts. He concludes that writers such as Ruskin, Morris, and Hodgson often chose fantasy as the means to present their most serious ideas and that "the strange worlds of such paintings and fictions have an equal, if not greater, capacity to return us to everyday life with our imagina- tions exercised and strengthened as do works 96</page><page sequence="2">of the realistic schools. " It is interesting that when both essayists seek contemporary ex- amples of fantasy, they choose photograph- ers - Jerry Uelsmann and Wynn Bullock. Biographies of all artists are included with annotations of works on exhibition, all of which are lavishly illustrated. These are ar- ranged alphabetically by artist in the cata- logue, but by theme - precursors, children's fantasy, the world of faerie, horrific fantasy, exotic works, and anthropomorphic fantasy - when shown at RISD. The exhibition can currently be seen at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York through September 2. All in all, a delightful public expansion of works for which all will have private recall. 239 pp. Price: $12 plus $1.50 postage.</page></plain_text>
