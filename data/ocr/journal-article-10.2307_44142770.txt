Our interpretation of the evidence in the following sections also indicates that, although image of the deity in the animal form was an object of worship, her human attributes were also known. Her association with Shaivism remained quite patent even in the early phase, though her secular characteristics as the presiding goddess of wealth and prosperity contributed to the strengthening of her links with state power. 1.2 The Kuninda republican tribe worshipped the god Shiva and believed that he was their sovereign ruler. Their Chhatreshvara type of copper coins depicted the god Shiva as standing, holding a trident-battleaxe in his right hand and the left hand resting on the hip. 1 The 'stag and the goddess' device on another set of coins was equally popular with them. Alongside of the stag was shown the goddess standing on a flower and holding a flower in her right hand. 2 Expressing * AM- 16091, Reader in History. Rajdhani College, University of Delhi.</page><page sequence="2">Proceedings, ¡HC : 53rd Session, 1992-93 his agreement with Venkateswar, J.N.Banerjea maintained that the stag and the goddess were the theriomorphic and anthropomorphic depictions of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi 3 - who has been described as the Golden-Antelope (hiranyanarna-harini) bedecked with garlands made of gold and silver (suvarna- rajatasraja).4 1.3 Whether the Golden-Antelope deity was an Indian deity or she was brought into India along with her folk-lores and mythology by some people who entered India during the early Christian centuries? Whether the Kunindas were the people who promoted her worship in their territory? Or was she a Central Asian goddess whose worshippers had migrated to India from their Kardama river basin home (modern, Zarafshan) 5 and transformed her into the goddess Shri- Lakshmi by creating and developing supporting mythology? And was it a chance that a Sanskrit equivalent expression Kardama 6 was discovered which meant a swamp and its derivative Kardamaka 7stood for a lotus, the flower associated with Lakshmi? Does it not seem plausible that the original expression Kardamaka stood for the dynastic name of the western Shaka satraps 8 and was later on Indianised to provide the meaning lotus? 9 were some of the questions which inspired the enquiry whose results are offered in this paper. II THE HIRANYAVARNA-HARINI GODDESS OF THE SHRI-SUKTA 2.1 The fifteen verse Shri-Sukta has been composed in archaic Sanskrit with a view to provide it an imprint of antiquity. No wonder, it is traditionally believed to have been an integral part of the Khila supplement portion of the Rigbveda. 10 The verse 1 of the sukta calls the goddess Lakshmi hiranyavarna-harini wearing garlands of gold and silver and also Chandra and Hiranmayi. 11 Although the verse 4 makes mention of the enclosure where the image of the goddess is (or is to be) installed as the one made of gold (hiranya-prakara), 12 the theriomorphic manifestation of the goddess fades away in the subsequent verses. The only relevant information that we get in them is that she happened to be associated with the two places, viz., Prabhasa 13 and Pushkara. 14 2.2 Mention of Kardama as the progenitor and prayer made to him to ensure the stay of the goddess Shri in the family of the worshipper is quite intriguing, unless we accept that Kardama happened to be the ancestor of the ruling family which introduced the Shri-Lakshmi worship in the region. Chiklita is requested to inspire the goddess to stay in the family of the devotee. 15 The name Chiklita seems to be un-lndian, though the later day explanations declare him to be one of the sons of the goddess. 16 2.3 In so far as the mythology of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi is concerned two separate elements have been harmonised in a very peculiar manner. The goddess has been expressly called Deva-sakha, 17 which may mean a friend or consort of Shiva. Obviously the goddess Shri-Lakshmi has been identified as a Shaivite deity or has been incorporated in the Shaivite pantheon. On the other hand she has been described as the presiding deity of wealth, weal and 64</page><page sequence="3">Ragìiavendra Vajpeyi : Golden Antelope Deity &lt;&amp; Kardamaka State Power prosperity who owns the responsibility of destruction of her senior (Jyeshtha) A-lakshmi who manifests herself in the form of hunger ( kshudha ), thirst ( pipasa ), filth (mala), lack of progeny ( a-bhuti ) and poverty ( a-samridhi ). 18 The goddess is requested to remove all types of internal (antara) and external (bahya) A- lakshmi. 19 2.4 That this goddess Shri-Lakshmi was in fact the manifestation of state power and royal authority becomes clear from the verse 3 which asserts that the goddess Shri arises from heréslumber in the battle-field where horses, chariots and elephants are arrayed and the elephants charge with loud report (hasti- nada). 20 The use of the expression golden-staff (Yashti-suvarna) 21 for Lakshmi leaves no room for any doubt or debate with regard to the identity of royal sceptre and state power with Lakshmi. 2.5 Thus the concept of the Golden-Antelope undergoes modification and with the help of supporting mythology, she is identified with the Indian goddess Shri- Lakshmi. Natural resources of the earth and its capacity to feed and maintain living being strengthened the mother-goddess aspect of Shri-Lakshmi. Delineation of Shri-Lakshmi as mata , 22 Ishvari23 and Deva-sakha 24 converted the physical form of the earth into divine companion of the god Shiva and the latter the divine mother who cared for the material needs and well-being of her earthly children. And as the royal sceptre and state power - Raja-Lakshmi , she granted to the subjects the boon of orderly government, stability and peace and prosperity. 2.6 In spite of these complex elements the goddess Shri - Lakshmi of the Shri- Sukta manifests herself only in the form of the Golden-Antelope, and not in the form of the deity having anthropomorphic manifestation we come across on the Kuninda coins. And despite her strong association with the lotus flower as Padma-varna, Padmini and Padma-malini , 25 her later-day Lakshmi aspect fails to crystalise. So also, the Shri-Sukta does not seem to be aware of the possibilities of association of the goddess Lakshmi with the god Vishnu as his consort. 26 III DATE OF THE SHRI-SUKTA: SOME RELEVANT QUESTIONS 3.1 The deliberate use of Vedic metres and archaic style of the Shri-Sukta largely served the intended purpose of making it appear a hymn which flourished during the Rigvedic period. That is how it came to be included in the Khila supplement portion of the Shakala text of the Rigveda. And, as such, the sukta has acquired a place in the daily ritual prayers in the orthodox homes. But scholars like B.K.Ghosh and J.N.Banerjea have their reservations about its antiquity and historical validity. Ghosh is convinced that the Khila text was a spurious fabrication, 27 but Banerjea does not go beyond suggesting that it happens to be a late supplement. 28 Neither of them seems to be interested in examining its historical context. 3.2 The use of the expression Karishini29 for the goddess Shri-Lakshmi is indicative of the value of cow dung for boosting agricultural out-out. But such a situation 65</page><page sequence="4">Proceedings, ¡HC : 53rd Session, 1992-93 needed long-time for obtaining itself. Mention of three-limb army, viz., elephant force, chariots and cavalry, 30 suggests a post-Kautilya date for the Shri-Sukta. 31 The concept of state-subjects relations could not crystalise before the time of the Artha-shastra. 32 Although Saurashtra was an administrative unit which belonged to the category of rashtra , 33 the rashtra in which was born the composer of the Shri-Sukta was in all probability a vast empire. The mention of Prabhasa 34 and Pushkara 35 as the places associated with the goddess Shri- Lakshmi, particularly that of Pushkara suggest a date not earlier than the second century A.D. 36 The concept of the existence of A-Lakshmi as the senior anti-deity of Lakshmi whom the latter was supposed to destroy, too, does not seem to have gained some form before this time (second century) and, apart from the Shri-Sukta, the Vanaparva appears to have been among the first few texts which happen to know about Jyeshtha-Alakshmi. 37 The Puranic depiction of Jyeshtha, 38 and of Lakshmi as an antelope, 39 seem to belong to the pose- Shri-Sukta phase, when the Shaivite deity Shri-Lakshmi was deliberately transformed into a Vaishnavite deity goddess and was described as the consort of Vishnu.40 Although the second-first century B.C. Buddhist sculptures indicate that images of folk-divinities (grama-devata) were made and worshipped, 41 we have yet to come across evidence which may prove that images of brahmanical deities were either made or worshipped in pre-christian centuries. All that can be said with some confidence is that the Shri-Sukta flourished sometime before the issue of Kuninda coins having the stag and a female deity device. 42 3.3 The Ghosundi stone inscription of king Sarvatata, which flourished in the latter- half of the first century B.C., is the earliest which makes mention of enclosure (prakara) in which were kept votive stones ( puja-shila ) associated with the names of the Vrishni heroes Samkarshana and Vasudeva (Krishna). 43 And, it was not before the time of Sodasa (A.D. 10-25) when idols of deified five heroes of the Vrishni were made and were housed in some stone-temple or enclosure (shaila-devagriha).44 Expressions like mahasthana, devakula, torana and vedika too surfaced during that time and came to be used in their typical religious context. 45 Such places of worship happened to be structural temples or not, cannot be said with any amount of confidence. And the hiranya-prakara of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi too could have belonged to their category. IV HYPOTHESIS 4.1 Our hypothesis in the following paragraphs is based on analysis of various names of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi, her suggested association with things, places and people mentioned in the Shri-Sukta. Although it may appear wide of the mark, the verse 1 1 invocation of Kardama and the statement in it that the children/subjects were the creation of Kardama who could ensure perpetual stay of the goddess Shri in the house of the devotee 46 seem to be quite intentional. 4.2 As we have stated earlier, the use of the expression Kardama was make in the specific and technical sense of the region through which flowed the river Kardama, 66</page><page sequence="5">Ra g ha vend ra Vajpeyi : Golden Antelope Deity &amp; Kardamaka State Power the same as the river Zarafshan. It seems to have been the same region of Central Asia which was due north of the river Oxus and in it was included Western Tartary - it was comprised in Scythia of the Greeks, asserts Nundulal Dey. 47 According to him, it was called Pushkara-dvipa , which was derived from Bhushkara or Bokhara. 48 The mention of Karadamaka, as the family from which had descended the mahakshatrapa Ru, whose daughter was the devi of Vasishthiputra Shri - Satakarni, in a Kahheri inscription, 49 and of Pushkara, as the place to which Lakshmi belonged, seem to be indicative of non-Indian origin of the Golden Antelope deity. 50 It can be suggested that her identification as Shri-Lakshmi was the result of the deliberate attempt of getting her absorbed in the brahmanical mythology. This effort becomes more apparent in transformation of Kardamaka and Pushkara into lotus in their Indian context and that too without distorting their Sanskrit form. No wonder, the fifteen verse Shri-Sukta has five repeated associations of the goddess Shri -Lakshmi with padma, the lotus flower and invokes her by calling her -Padmini, Padma-varna, Padma-malini and Padme-sthita. 51 4.3 The Shri-Sukta wants us to believe that the rashtra in which the composer of the hymn lived was an impressive state. The names Prabhasa 52 and Pushkarini 53 of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi are not only indicative of her association with Junagarh 54 and Ajmer 55 areas but also of the inclusion of both the places in that rashtra. Likewise, mention of the goddess as Yahkarini, 56 or the one who holds sceptre in her hand and Yashti , 57 or the royal sceptre incarnate, too seem to indicate that she was being described as manifestation of power of that state. It was the military might of that state which made the goddess rise from her slumber when horses, chariots and elephants were arrayed in the battle - field and the elephants made loud reports during their interlocking with the enemy elephants. 58 4.4 If we are to believe the Shri-Sukta , economy of the state was in bad shape prior to the advent of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi. Internal and external A-Lakshmi manifested itself in the conditions leading to hunger, thirst, poverty and the situation reflected in dry zone on the advent of the asterism Jyeshtha which heralded the advent of the summer season. 59 Like the rise of asterism Adra which denoted onset of rainy season, Lakshmi manifested herself in the form of cattle, fertilised soils capable of crop. production, precious metals - gold and silver - and bronze alloys - all contributing to economic prosperity of the state.60 Although the Shri-Sukta does not make any mention of trade and commerce, it rather over-emphasises the intimate connection of the goddess with gold by calling her Hiranya-varna, Hiranmayi, Suvarna, Hema-malini and Pingala .61 Her repeated invocation as Chandra-Hiranmayi 62 and mention as Chandra 63 and Prabhasa 64 seem to be indicative of the role of foreign exchange in boosting economy by ensuring the inflow of gold and silver. We should not be surprised if silver coins were especially used in connection with West Asian trade, carried on through Gujarat ports like the Prabhasa port of Saurashtra. 4.5 The composer of the Shri-Sukta expresses his keen desire to ensure the perpetual stay of the goddess Shri-Lakshmi at his residence ( an-apagamini Lakshmi ) and to avail through her grace riches ( hiranyä ), cattle (gavsh), horses 67</page><page sequence="6">Proceedings , ¡HC : 53rd Session, 1992-93 (ashvan), slaves and servants ( dasya-purushan ). 65 For ensuring this grace of the goddess, he invokes Kardama and requests him to see that the mother Shri settles down in the family of the devotee. 66 Obviously the composer of the hymn is soliciting the support of the ruler belonging to the family of Kardama in a round about manner, and, instead of asking for royal patronage, he wants the latter's support for ensuring the grace of the goddess. V CONCLUSION 5.1 As we have pointed out earlier, mention of Kardama as the progenitor of the family in the Shri-Sukta happens to be quite intentional. It is well-known that Kardamaka will be the simple derivative of the expression Kardama , and the only ruling dynasty known to us which associated itself with Kardama was the line of the Western Satraps belonging to the family of Tsamotika. 67 And., as we have referred to earlier, the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra's younger son Vasishthiputra Shri-Shatakarni was married to a Karadamaka princess, who was the daughter of the mahakshatrapa Ru(dra-daman). 68 The reference to Jyeshtha-Alakshmi, prior to the period of the arousal of Lakshmi from her slumber, could have been an indirect hint to the condition which prevailed in the Shaka territory of western India during its occupation by Gautamiputra Shri- Shatakarni. 69 If it was so, then, arousal of Lakshmi from her sleep during military engagement signalled by elephant noises, would in the like manner indicate restoration of the Shaka authority under the leadership of Chashtana and Rudradaman, after total discomfiture of Gautamiputra. 70 The Yahkarini and Yashii aspects of Lakshmi make her appear as Raja-Lakshmi and Raja-danda. The active concern which Rudradaman had for his people and their welfare, is well-attested by the evidence of the Junagarh rock inscription. 71 Rudradaman patronised brahminism and brahmanas. 72 If the author of the Shri-Sukta was inspired to express the gratitude of the brahmanas to the royal family of the Kardamakas in general and to Rudradaman in particular because of whose grace the goddess of plenty had favoured them, we should not be surprised. 5.2 In our considered opinion the Golden Antelope deity and her mythology and worship were introduced in India by the Kardamaka branch of the Shaka Kshatrapas, sometime in the middle of the second century. Since the 'stag and the deity' device on the Kuninda coins indicated evolution of anthropomorphism along with theriomorphism - the stage which could not be reached by the Shri- Sukta Hiranyavama-Harini goddess-, it seems plausible that it were the Kardamaka Shakes and not the Kunindas who had introduced her worship. The deliberate fusion of Central Asian traditions with the Buddhist Sirma-devata tradition, 73 as well as, the Lakshmi traditions not only made her acceptability in the brahmanical mythology possible but also facilitated her acceptability and popularity in the Shaivite pantheon as the consort of the god Shiva. The tree in railing, Shri-Vatsa and the crescent and the three mounts symbols which appears on the aforesaid Kuninda coin 74 device clearly indicate how the three traditions were synthesised to accommodate the Antelope deity in the Indian tradition and setting. 68</page><page sequence="7">Raghavendra Vajpeyi : Golden Antelope Deity &amp; Kardamaka State Power NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.
