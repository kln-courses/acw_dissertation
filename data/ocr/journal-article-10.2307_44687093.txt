ABSTRACT Air Force (AF) pilots experience forces during emergency escape and/or crash with potential for head and neck injuries. These forces are increased by aerodynamic and inertial properties of current helmet- mounted systems used for flight display and targeting. The motorsports industry has documented many injury- causing crashes and has a higher incidence of mishaps. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has entered into cooperative research with motorsports to establish a relationship between multi-axis impact acceleration and injury for improving pilot/driver protection concepts. This paper reports the development and preliminary results of using an instrumented race helmet to obtain head accelerations during racing mishaps. These data may be used to calculate neck loads for correlation to injury, and to revise impact tolerance criteria pertinent to military and commercial crash protection. INTRODUCTION Sports professionals who routinely perform in potentially injurious situations are prime candidates to contribute data pertinent to the field of aviation safety. For example, race car drivers, boxers, football players, and downhill ski racers are exposed to abrupt acceleration and force environments that sometimes result in muscle, skeletal or nervous system injury. These participants' heads are free to accelerate and impact nearby surfaces, or cause excessive neck tension, extension, shear, and/or rotational loads to develop. The capability to regularly and continuously monitor head accelerations and resulting injuries could provide crucial data for development of reliable head and neck injury criteria. These criteria are needed for new helmet and padding/restraint designs to limit the occurrence of head and neck trauma. The Air Force is involved in the design of helmets and helmet-mounted systems that provide the pilot with critical flight information during normal operations and yet provide protection should the pilot have to escape due to aircraft malfunction. The human injury data required for ideal injury risk assessment do not exist since too few injuries have occurred while the mechanical force environment is being measured. Moreover, since the introduction of crash data recorders in open wheel race cars during the early 1990's, it has been shown that well restrained drivers can experience peak accelerations greater than 100 G for short durations without thoracic injury. Biodynamic researchers, notably John Melvin, developer of the crash data program in Indy Racing League (IRL) and Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), believe these new data show that current injury thresholds may be too low (Melvin et al, 1998). Motorsports offers an opportunity to collect data on head acceleration related to injury, which is not available elsewhere, because race drivers have a much higher incidence of excessive accelerations due to crash. Recent advances in data collection and sensor technology make it possible to monitor these sports professionals during injurious impact events without affecting their performance. In October 1998, the Air Force Research Laboratory and TRICE Motorsports Research established a collaborative effort to develop pilot and driver injury prevention concepts. This effort also included the development of a robust measurement system, which could collect head impact data during auto racing crashes. The Air Force Research Laboratory is providing the strategic direction, and laboratory facilities. TRICE is coordinating the interface with racing officials, teams and tracks, and providing expertise on racing operations. DynCorp, the engineering support partner, is providing technical design 2540</page><page sequence="2">and development plus data analysis. This paper is a status report on the collaborative effort to obtain head accelerations in 6 degrees-of-freedom using an instrumented helmet under laboratory and racetrack conditions. SPECIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS The race sanctioning bodies and race teams had several operational concerns to consider before assembling the instrumentation system to monitor drivers during a race. Unobtrusive - Drivers and team managers do not want to use equipment that will interfere with driver performance or add any race team workload. In talking with race team and medical officials, their primary concern demanded that the instrumentation suite be unobtrusive. Low Weight - Since helmet manufacturers strive to eliminate as much weight from their helmets as possible, the weight of the helmet sensor system was an early design consideration. Low Cost - A near-term goal of race sanctioning bodies is to mandate this head impact monitoring across their leagues, but the costs must be reasonable before that will occur. With linear accelerometers often costing more than $500 each, a nine- sensor system could cost $4500 exclusive of helmet cost and labor. The micro- machined, mass-produced EG&amp;G IC Sensors Model 3031 was selected for this effort because they are small and less than $60 each in quantity. Simple To Operate - The current crash data recording systems on the cars do not require extensive technical background. Therefore, the new system must be simple to install, set up, and download collected data. Sanitized Data - This technology application affords a tremendous opportunity to collect data across a diverse community of participants. The greatest benefit will be derived from the unrestricted availability of the injury data to the impact safety community. Sufficient safeguards must be implemented to remove identifiers from the data to eliminate the possibility of liability to the race sanctioning bodies. METHODS AND EQUIPMENT INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM DESIGN - This project represents a proof-of-concept evaluation to demonstrate the viability of using miniature sensors and recorders to measure driver head accelerations in auto race conditions. Nine-Tap Array - King, et al (1974) developed the theory that an array of nine linear accelerometers could be used to calculate acceleration in 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF). The 6 degrees are three translational and three rotational accelerations. The required placement of one tri-axial and three bi-axial accelerometer arrays (a 3-2-2- 2 orthogonal array) is shown in Figure 1. The AFRL experimented with the nine-tap methodology in the late seventies with limited success. The measurement centers of tranducers used were not known and the calculation of angular acceleration contained errors. Newer sensor technology allows for accurate alignment of the measurement centers in the required orthogonal array. Figure 1: Sensor Array and Coordinate System 2541</page><page sequence="3">The accelerometers were placed in the helmet liner for rigid support and sensor protection (See Figure 2). This arrangement has yielded excellent results. Accurate placement of the sensors was achieved with a precision device manufactured in the laboratory (See Figure 3). Figure 2: Accelerometers Installed in Helmet Liner Figure 3: Device Used For Accelerometer Installation Micro-machined Sensors - The IC Sensors Model 3031 is a solid-state, piezoresistive accelerometer packaged in a surface-mount configuration. These low-mass sensors are micro-machined from silicon and built as a three- layered structure. They exhibit a low noise signature on the order of ± 0.2 G, but they have been reliable sensors over the eighteen months they were used. The sensors used have a range of +/- 100G, a maximum limit of 2000 Gs, and a frequency response range of 0-1500 Hz, with a 3000 Hz resonate frequency. They were chosen for the nine-tap array in the helmet because of ťieir small size and low cost. The performance of the Model 3031 accelerometers was compared to the standard linear and angular sensors available in the AFRL. The AFRL standard sensors are more expensive, and have performed well in years of testing. A mix of Endevco and Entran sensors were used, which were calibrated before and after each test program. These reference sensors were placed in the manikin head and on the sled and the test fixture. For reference data during racetrack testing, a package of three linear and one angular rate sensor was also assembled and mounted on the floorboard of the car. A special mouthpack was developed to provide a head acceleration reference for testing with human subjects wearing the race helmet in the laboratory. The race helmet fits very close all around the face, and laboratory standard mouthpacks were too large to even don the helmet. The small Model 3031 sensors were selected again for a new mouthpack design, which barely protruded from the mouth. Nine sensors were used in three tri-axial packages. There was a package at each corner of the mouth and a third near the middle of the tongue (see Figure 4). From this array, the three linear components of head acceleration were measured and the angular accelerations were computed using a Kaiman Filter algorithm. Figure 4: Mouthpack With Micro-Machined Sensors Earplug Sensors - There is concern in the biodynamic community that a helmet-mounted instrumentation suite will not be adequate because the helmet slips on the head. Since drivers wear earplugs for hearing protection and communication, earplugs were candidates for head- mounted sensors, but there were no tri-axial accelerometer sensors small enough. This challenge was discussed with Endevco, and the AFRL co-sponsored an effort with them to develop a miniature tri-axial accelerometer suitable for this application. With micro- machining technology, they produced a piezoresistive tri- axial device capable of ±500 Gs in a package 10x7x4 mm, which weighs only 0.4 gram. 2542</page><page sequence="4">The newly developed earplug sensors will be used by the AFRL to explore relative head/helmet motion. They should provide sufficient additional information on head motion to construct a model, which will provide head motion based on helmet motion. Breakaway Connectors - Part of the unobtrusiveness requirement for the instrumentation system was to have a simple hook-up and automatic disconnect in the event of an emergency egress. Airborne, Inc. subminiature connectors with plastic shells were selected for the job. These flat, lightweight connectors are normally used in panel-mount environments. Male and female parts were used, the mounting screw tabs were removed, and connection was made as an in-line friction fit. All leads from the helmet and earplug sensors were brought to one connector that extends approximately two inches from the back of the helmet behind the driver's left ear. The connector easily disconnects when the driver stands up to get out of the car. Data Acquisition System - AFRL used a large, 64- channel EME Corp data acquisition system mounted on- board our 24-inch HYGE horizontal acceleration sled for in-house testing. EME's small 16/32 channel 'NanoDAS' data acquisition systems were used for testing at the track. The NanoDAS was designed for installation in manikins used during ejection seat testing. They are small (6.40 in x 1.50 in x 3.85 in, 1.2 lbs), battery- powered systems with a flexible software interface. These recorders are also used with small sensors to conduct operational field testing on various aircraft types for vibration studies. Figure 5: Subject With Instrumented Helmet LABORATORY TESTING The instrumented helmet liner and mouthpack instrumentation systems were first tested in the laboratory on manikin heads, then full manikins, and finally human volunteers using the AFRL Horizontal Impulse Accelerator. Helmet Liner Only - The nine linear accelerometers were installed in the foam liner of a Simpson racing helmet. The instrumented liner was mounted on an instrumented headform attached by a solid neck to the AFRL Horizontal Impulse Accelerator (HIA) and accelerated at 6, 10 or 15 Gs. Initially the testing was pure translation; then a fixture was added to allow combined translation and rotation of the headform. The headform was mounted so that linear accelerations in x, y, z, and rotations about these a&lt;es could be accomplished. The nine-tap array in the helmet was not aligned to the head coordinate system, but the angular difference was measured. Euler angles were used to transform the measured accelerations into a coordinate system parallel to the head reference system. Linear and angular accelerations were computed for the origin of the nine-tap array. Helmet on Humans - The instrumented liner was inserted in the helmet shell and tested by placing the helmet on an Advanced Dynamic Anthropomorphic Manikin (ADAM) or on a human volunteer and accelerating the subject up to 7 Gs in the +Y axis while sitting up right in a generic seat (see Figure 5). The human subjects used the instrumented mouthpack developed for this program. LABORATORY RESULTS Tests with the helmet liner-only mounted on a manikin headform showed that the nine-tap array readings had good agreement with those from the reference sensors in the headform and on the HIA sled. Figure 6 shows the comparison of internal head (measured) versus nine-tap derived) acceleration response for a pure translation test in the Z-axis. Figure 7 was selected from a test with rotation and again shows a comparison between internal head and nine-tap angular acceleration about the Z-axis. In these figures, there is a small phase shift in the response of the manikin head and the nine-tap in the helmet liner, which is due to non-rigid coupling between the sled, the head and the helmet liner. 2543</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6: Horizontal Impulse Accelerator (24 Inch HYGE Sled) Test Showing Good Results From The Nine-Tap Figure 7: Angular Acceleration Derived From the Nine-Tap Showing Good Agreement 2544</page><page sequence="6">Figure 8: Side Impact (Gv) Testing Reveals Some Helmet Slip The side-impact series of tests with the complete instrumented helmet on manikins and humans clearly showed the slippage of the helmet relative to the head. Figure 8 shows the linear acceleration response of the seat pan, mouthpack, and nine tap. Note that the nine- tap in the helmet initially tracks well with the seat and then decouples, but the head response, measured by the mouthpack, is delayed approximately 75 milliseconds from the start of the pulse. This is evidence of helmet slip caused by padding and fit of the helmet. The relative motion was confirmed by observation of the high-speed video (500 frames/sec). In order to understand the nature and significance of this slippage, future tests will include miniature tri-axial acceierometers in earplugs to monitor the difference between acceleration of the helmet and the head. RACETRACK TESTING AND RESULTS Racetrack tests with the instrumented helmet were interspersed with laboratory testing when track support was available. Track testing was conducted using a Barber Dodge Pro Series open-wheeled car on a road course, an IRL car on a high-speed oval, and a Barber Dodge Pro Series Car on a combined oval/road course circuit. Mid-Ohio 99 - The instrumented helmet was tested at Mid- Ohio Sports Car Course during the preparations for the Miller Lite 200 and associated races. A Barber Dodge Pro Series (BDPS) test driver wore the helmet while driving a BDPS Dodge-powered Reynard. The car was 2545 instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer and yaw sensor package mounted on the cockpit floor on the centerline behind the seat. Data were collected using an EME 16-channel "NanoDAS" mounted in the side-pod. The driver started the session by pushing a button in the cockpit as he crossed the start/finish line. Four complete laps of data and one static run-up were recorded. A comparison of the car longitudinal (inline) and lateral accelerations agrees with the data from the helmet (see Figures 9 &amp; 10) Indianapolis 99 - The nine-tap instrumented helmet was tested at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in an Indianapolis Racing League (IRL) car. The speeds ranged from 170 to 214 mph and the maximum lateral acceleration was 2.5 Gs. As at Mid-Ohio, the data from the helmet mounted sensors show that the head- accelerations mimic the car accelerations during normal race conditions. Homestead 2000 - Barber Dodge Pro Series again provided a car and test driver. This time the helmet was augmented with the new miniature tri-axial sensor developed by Endevco. The new miniature sensor was mounted in the helmet liner on top of the left bi-axial sensor pack cf the nine-tap array. Data were collected with the NanoDAS mounted on the floor under the forward edge of the seat pan next to the bulkhead (i.e. under the knees of the driver). The tri-axial/yaw sensor package was on the car centerline in back of the seat. Data were collected for a total of 10 laps in three sessions on the combined road/high-speed course. The third session (6 laps) was sampled at 2000 Hz to capture more data. A</page><page sequence="7">static engine run-up was also conducted in the garage area to check for engine vibration, acoustic or electro-magnetic interference. As noted during the previous racetrack testing, the helmet-mounted sensors correlated very well with car-mounted sensors. Figure 9: Car and Helmet lateral Acceleration Figure 10: Car And Helmet Inline (Gx) Acceleration 2546</page><page sequence="8">ANALYSIS I DISCUSSION Figure 10 exhibits some interesting characteristics. It is the plot of car versus helmet accelerations in the longitudinal (inline) axis. There is some offset between these curves because the channels were not fully zeroed at the beginning of the recording. The car trace has more high-frequency components because its sensor package was mounted to the car chassis, whereas the helmet trace reflects natural body dampening. On the other hand, the helmet amplitude excursions are larger due to the distance of the helmet instrumentation system from the acceleration inputs to the driver. Both traces have pronounced spikes caused by shifting the gears. All the data presented here were collected on EME Corp. data recorders. The recorders were operated at 10 K Hz sample rate and filtered at 2500 Hz cutoff frequency. In processing, the data were decimated and software filtered as indicated on each graph. The EME systems use a five-pole butterworth filter for post processing, and output an ASCII time history file for each channel of data. With the NanoDASs in the cars, over 90 seconds of data were collected in each track session, but only 15-second segments are displayed to provide sufficient resolution for analysis. For future testing, the AFRL is sponsoring the development of a new miniature data acquisition system smaller than the NanoDAS. For the past two years, AFRL has been working with a small business, SPEC, Inc., to develop an ejection seat 'black box' recorder. The sensors, recorder and power supply are all contained in a 4x3x1 .5 inch unit, and it records nine channels of data. SPEC is developing a spin-off of their original recorder for application to the cooperative research with motorsports. The new recorder will collect up to 19 channels of data from external sources in the same size unit, and it is expected to cost less than the NanoDAS. Laboratory testing of the new recorder will begin later this year. CONCLUSION The viability of the helmet-mounted nine-tap array of linear sensors to determine accelerations in Sdegrees- of-freedom was demonstrated. This sensor package, combined with small data recorders, is a practical, unobtrusive means of monitoring head accelerations. These sensors, under non-impact conditions, show that head accelerations mimic those of the car. The question of helmet slip remains and, from the in-house laboratory data, there is quantitative information to begin understanding this phenomenon. Further testing with the addition of the newly developed tri-axial earplug sensors may lead to a model that can account for the slip (see Figure 11). The first of these sensors performed well in testing at Homestead Miami Speedway. The next phase of testing will be to use the new earplug sensor in tests up to 127 Gs in the laboratory. In addition, a new prototype small (4x3x1.5 in), 19-channel recorder will be tested under the same impact conditions before returning to the race track for more extensive testing. Figure 11: Mini Tri-Axial Accelerometers In Earplugs Scale: 1 Unit Equals 14 Inch The sharing of impact data between the aviation and racing communities will add to the understanding of injury thresholds, and could lead to improved safety for both communities. The characterization and modeling of helmet slip will help improve the effectiveness of helmet- mounted displays and tracking systems. Additionally, the technology push into miniaturized sensors and recorders is producing a capability to collect data in ways that are physically and operationally unobtrusive and are low cost. This capability enables data collection opportunities across the full range of real-world operational environments, and will temendously benefit military and commercial test communities. 2547</page><page sequence="9">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors wish to thank the participants in the Air Force Research Laboratory: Biodynamics and Acceleration Branch Tremendous support was also provided by: DynCorp Technical Services Veridian Engineering Simpson Racing Products EME Corporation PI Research Racing Radios Barber Dodge Endevco and the sanctioning bodies of CART and IRL, especially Drs.
