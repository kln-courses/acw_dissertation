<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edna Manley: The Mother of Modern Jamaican Art BETTY LADUKE Sculptor Edna Manley, "the mother of modern Ja- maican art,"' was also the wife of Norman Manley, from 1955 to 1969 Jamaica's first prime minister, and is the mother of Michael Manley, Jamaica's prime min- ister from 1972 to 1980. Her monumental wood carv- ings, bronze and fiberglass castings, and large pencil drawings, which span six decades, can be found all over Jamaica, in the National Gallery, at the Olympia International Art Center, and in many private collections. Manley's figurative images from the 1920s and 1930s are symbolic portrayals of the Jamaican people strug- gling to break free from English colonial rule. With works such as The Beadseller (1923), Negro Aroused (1935), and The Prophet (1935), Manley urged the peo- ple to develop national pride and free themselves from European cultural values. (Independence was achieved in 1962.) Manley is also concerned in her work with the eter- nal verities: the life cycle, joy and grief, love, sensu- ality, religious faith, motherhood, and death. In sculptures such as Market Women (1975), Man-Child (1976), and Ghetto Mother (1983), Manley transcends cultural boundaries and offers strong, universal state- ments concerning the role of women, and especially older women, in society. In its power and depth and its concern for humanistic values, Manley's mature work can be compared to that of Kathe Kollwitz. EARLY LIFE IN ENGLAND Edna Swithenbank was born in 1900, in Bourne- mouth, England. Her mother was Jamaican (and to all outward appearances "white"), while her father, Harvey Swithenbank, was an English Methodist min- ister. He died when Edna was nine, leaving Edna's mother Ellie to raise a family of nine children. Edna is the middle child. Her early behavior has been de- scribed as turning inward to "daydreams" or outward with "tantrums."2 It was not until secondary school that Edna's interests turned to art and literature. Dur- ing her rural childhood and adolescence she developed a love for animals, especially horses, a lifelong interest that later manifested itself in her art. Her adolescent fantasy was to escape the restrictions of her provincial family, and when Edna was 17 her mother permitted her to go to London to work in the Pensions Branch of the War Office-this was to be her contribution to the war effort. After the war she enrolled in an art-teacher training program at the Re- gent Street Polytechnic Art School, but found it to be "a very dead place. I mean, you come in, you are full of life, but you are not put into a life class." Plaster casts were used as models, and, she says, "I think it's the worst way to start an education. It took me years to throw off the inhibitions that I learned there as a draughtsman."3 Edna Swithenbank first met Norman Manley, her cousin and eight years her senior, when, as a Rhodes Scholar, he came to England from Jamaica in 1914 to study law. Norman and his brother, who was also studying in England, soon enlisted in the service; Nor- man survived, but his brother did not. At war's end, Edna and Norman renewed their friendship. He encouraged her to become a professional artist, and she saw in him a way to separate from her family. While he was at Oxford, she worked at the Pensions Office during the day, took classes at night, and began to model in clay on the weekends. It was during this period that the extensive Manley corre- spondence began. Norman had proposed marriage, but, as she wrote, "I can't compromise, life won't have compromises. If I married you I would forget art, you are the only person living who can absolutely make me forget art,"4 and later, "Love meant marriage and marriage meant children and that was a trap."5 In 1920, "to complete an exhaustive apprenticeship in her craft before leaving England," Edna enrolled in the St. Martin's School of Art by day, where she modeled in clay and plaster of Paris, and the Royal Academy at night, where she studied anatomy. Her earlier studies had been mostly of animals, and now she began modeling the female nude. When Norman completed his studies in 1921, they married. In 1922, shortly after the birth of their first son, Douglas, the family sailed for Jamaica. Norman had forewarned her about the lack of a European-style art audience in Jamaica, but he promised to find op- portunities for her to work and exhibit in his home- land, and to maintain "their ideal of what a good marriage is-absolute freedom, and fullness of life; and yet also absolute-union-absolute comradeship."6</page><page sequence="2">Woman's Art Journal 37 Fig. 1.

THE FORMATIVE YEARS When the Manleys first arrived, Edna, who had grown up with "the most nostalgic stories of Jamaica," felt she had "come home."' However, she soon disco- vered that in 1922 the Jamaican middle class expected their women to be shadows of their husbands. Unde- terred, she became a keen observer of Jamaican life, constantly recording in her sketchbook the gestures and expressions of the people, in the market place, at religious meetings, or at work in the fields. According to Rosalie Smith McCrae, a curator at Jamaica's Na- tional Gallery, "She was the first artist to express Ja- maican themes and the physical qualities of the people." But, insists McCrae, "if it had been the work of a Black Jamaican artist it would have been totally rejected."8 Manley's first truly Jamaican work was the bronze Beadseller (1923), created during her first months on the island. "Clearly, her arrival in Jamaica had been a stimulating experience, artistically speaking, for there is a remarkable leap in imagination that sepa- rates the conventional animal studies and portraits of her art school days from this early masterpiece with its elegantly Cubist structure,"' wrote David Boxer in his catalogue essay to a 1983 exhibit of Jamaican art. The only curve that breaks the sharp rhythms of the beadseller's lean, angular body is a necklace sus- pended from her forward thrusting hands. Beadseller is the symbolic personification of the pain and suf- fering of an impoverished people. The Manleys' second son, Michael, was born in 1924, and as Norman's reputation as a lawyer increased, so did the family's income. During the 1920s Edna con- tinued to work in total professional isolation, returning periodically to England for stimulation, as well as to seek opportunities to exhibit. Her first show in London was in 1929 at the Goupil Gallery; she also exhibited with the London Group, along with Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Manley was a member of the So- ciety of Women Artists and participated in the Wom- en's International Art Club Exhibition of 1930. During the years of struggle against English colonial rule, however, she stopped showing her work in England. One piece from this period, the 79-inch dark mahog- any carving Eve (1928), with its rounded, sensual body forms, received much critical acclaim. In The Art of Carved Sculpture (1931), Kineton Parker called Eve "her most important work so far" and commented that "Edna Manley's especial value to the art of the present day is her adherence to nature and her new interpre- tation of it."'o The East Anglian Times art critic con- sidered Manley "a champion of human rights" and Eve a "realization of an ideal of the mother of man- kind [which] departs from those of masculine imag- ination by the complete absence of any indication of feminine weakness."" While appreciated abroad, in Jamaica Manley's work was still greeted by "puzzled indifference" or "hostility."12 However, in 1929 she received the Insti- tute of Jamaica Silver Musgrave Medal for her sculp- ture. And as other European-trained artists began to arrive and Jamaica began to train its own artists, the cultural climate and the attitude toward Manley's art began to change. Two works from 1935-Negro Aroused (Fig. 1) and The Prophet (Fig. 2)-have become her signature pieces. They are "nothing less than the icons of that</page><page sequence="3">38 Woman's Art Journal period of our history, a period when the Black Jamai- can was indeed aroused, ready for a new social order, demanding his place in the sun,""3 wrote David Boxer. The simple lines of Negro Aroused, a carved-mahog- any, half-length figure, invoke an expression of elegant defiance: the head is turned upward, as if in search of a vision, and contrasts with the firm, straight lines of the figure's back. One arm angles away from the body, while the other is carved close to the torso; the hands are folded, one upon the other, in a gesture that seems to support the will of the figure. Manley later commented on Negro Aroused: "[I] was trying to create a national vision ... trying to put something into being that was bigger than myself and almost other than myself. It [took] me weeks to stop- being the Negro Aroused."14 When it was exhibited in her first one-person show in Jamaica in 1937, the Kingston Gleaner reviewer Esther Chapan wrote of Manley's work, at the same time giving some insights into the evolving state of Jamaican culture: In Jamaica I have heard her work described as "gro- tesque," "distorted." I have known people violently an- gry at her work and at her temerity as a woman in daring to produce it. I have heard this work into which all her ardour and emotion and creative talent have been poured dismissed as a "hobby." And I have come back to Jamaica to see this attitude changed.Y'5 After the exhibit, Negro Aroused was purchased by public subscription for the Institute of Jamaica, which oo Fig. 4. Edna Manley, Ghetto Mother (1983), bronze h. 54". National Gallery of Jamaica, Kingston. is now the National Gallery of Jamaica. With The Prophet, a three-quarter-length mahogany figure, Manley sought to symbolize the Jamaican peo- ple's aspiration for political reform. The Prophet's arms are upraised, the hands joined high above the head to form a powerful arc. Here the figure looks not to the heavens, but to the viewers, the people. Edna Manley, it seems, gave visual expression to her husband's political statements, for in 1938 Norman wrote: We believe that the people must consciously believe in themselves and their own destiny and must do so with pride and with confidence and with the determination to win equality with the rest of mankind-an equality in terms of humanity which, irrespective of power and wealth, can be measured by the growing values of civ- ilization and culture.16 In 1938 began a series of riots and strikes which led ultimately to the politicizing of the working class and to the formation of two political parties: the People's National Party led by Norman Manley and the Ja- maica National Party headed by his cousin Alexander Bustamante. For much of the next 20 years, Edna actively supported her husband's political career, and, according to E.G. Smith, "When Norman finally took office as Chief Minister in 1955, Edna Manley set aside her own work as an artist and teacher to help her great husband as best she could to bear the burden of his office."" ARTISTIC INFLUENCE Edna Manley's influence upon the cultural life of Jamaica extended in many directions and was not always well received. For example, during her visits to Europe in the 1930s she purchased a small number of African carvings, which she brought to Jamaica and "displayed with the air of someone landing a prize. They were ridiculed.""'8 In the 1940s Manley, along with several other art- ists, organized art classes. From this activity interest in the visual arts began to grow, and eventually in 1950 the Jamaica School of Art was established. "These artists together," according to Boxer, "laid the foundation for an indigenous iconography: Jamaican life, Jamaican landscape, Jamaican faces became the means to convey the nationalist sentiments."19 An art market began to develop, and with it various cultural journals, including Public Opinion (founded 1937) and Focus (founded 1943), both of which had as one of their founding editors Edna Manley. By 1950 Manley's early political work gave way to more private concerns. Boxer claims Manley retreated "into a very private world spawned by a new-found interest in the writings and drawings of William Blake."' Many of her works during this period are anthropomorphic as she looked to the shapes of the nearby hills and mountains for inspiration. In the ma- hogany carving The Hills of Papine (1950), for exam- ple, the mother is like a protective mountain as she embraces the small child asleep in her arms. In fact, the piece was created in the woods, in an open studio shed at the retreat she and Norman had built. This work has a richer texture than many of the earlier</page><page sequence="4">Woman's Art Journal 39 ... ...... .. . ................. ............  ..... ,.. .... ......... .. Fig. 3.

Her output during the period of Norman's greatest political power was "defocused," according to Boxer, but after Norman's death in 1969, "she resumed her career with a vengeance, and in the seventies, pro- duced a remarkable body of work which re-established her as one of the most profound practising artists in the country."21 In the first several years after Norman's death, Edna created a series of wood carvings-The Angel, Adios, The Phoenix, The Faun, Journey, and Moun- tain Woman-in which she expressed the grief, de- spair, and finally the acceptance of her loss. In The Angel, the smaller symbolic form of Norman is held within the protective embrace of a winged female; Adios represents the couple's final embrace; The Phoe- nix symbolizes Christ's resurrection; and The Faun refers to her inner terrors. In the 61?-inch wall piece Journey (1974), the rising figure of Norman contains recessed concave areas around the eyes and rib cage. The curve of the head pushes past the top edge of the wood, while his toes cling to the bottom-right corner of the womb-like shape. Norman, here, is Christ-like. Mountain Woman, according to Boxer, is the "triumphant carving of a 70-year-old woman who has at last accepted the fact of her husband's death, and who is ready to enter her eighth decade with a determined purpose."' These were her final woodcarvings. The theme of older women and their role in society is explored in works such as The Message (1977), The Ancestor (1974), and Man-Child (1974; Fig. 3). Manley described the impetus for The Message, a 45-inch bronze: I saw them in the market, two women sitting, lost to the hubbub around them. I watched them and drew them on the back of my cheque book.... They were probably sharing some earthy secret. I never knew what it was, but it was a secret an older woman tells a younger woman.23 In The Ancestor, a 44-inch bronze, a tall, lean grand- mother reaches downward to embrace the smaller male figure, while his arms reach upward, paralleling hers. Boxer explains, "The [smaller] figure is not a child, but a man,"4 and the grandmother figure is the myth- ical ancestor. The three seated figures of the life-size Man-Child are set in the courtyard of Kingston's Olympia Inter- national Art Center. A child clings to his mother and is embraced by both his mother and grandmother. Ap- proaching the figures, one feels as if coming upon an intimate family scene. Manley described how the work reflects the Jamaican family structure: It is a matriarchal society-I am speaking about the masses-it is only recently that the father is making his presence felt-this is one of the positive things about the Rastofarian Culture-but the grandmother is usually the person who rears the children; the mother is usually out making a living. The father has for cen- turies been absent.2?</page><page sequence="5">40 Woman's Art Journal Attesting to her continued strength in the 1980s is Ghetto Mother (Fig. 4), a pyramid shaped group from 1983. Like the mothers in Kollwitz's post-World War I protective-mother series, Manley's anguished mother forms a nest to protect her many children from the world's evils. Edna Manley today has a house and studio in a Kingston suburb. She is tall, lean, agile, and remark- ably fit-perhaps from years of physical activity, mov- ing, cutting, and shaping heavy mahogany logs and tons of clay. The walls, floors, and tables of her home are covered with her enormous art collection. The patio looks onto a sculpture-filled garden and beyond to the hills of Papine. Manley shuns interviews, as she needs the "time to work." Presently she is "up to my eyebrows making drawings."26 Manley has in recent years traveled to Mexico and China and considers the "Mexican and Chinese artists as the surest and the best designers. Their sense of line is always right." She speaks little of politics, stating firmly, "No more politics for me now. In the years that are remaining for me, I just want the time to do my own work." Surrounded by her family and the art she loves, Manley advises: "One must always look forward to the future with hope." * 1.
