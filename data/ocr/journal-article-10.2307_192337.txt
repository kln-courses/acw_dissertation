<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Logic of Why-Questions Matti Sintonen The Finnish Academy and University of Helsinki In their classic work on the logic of explanation Hempel and Oppen- heim (1948) claim that to explain the phenomena in the world of our experience is to answer the question "why?", rather than the question "what?". But there is a source of embarrassment, viz., the under- developed logic of why-questions itself. In this paper I want to explore some recent advances which, I shall argue, help us to overcome some of the embarrassment. 1. Why-Questions and Epistemic Logic One way in which the logic of questions could help is proposed by Jaakko Hintikka. According to Hintikka (1981a) we can look upon scien- tific inquiry as a series of questions put to nature. For instance a scientist who tests a theory first derives its consequences C1,... % and then asks nature questions of the form "Is CO true?". The inquirer (querier) here attempts to induce from nature one of the conclusive answers "CO is true" or "CO is not true". Similarly, measurements can be regarded as what-questions in which, e.g., the value of a variable, say X in the following logical form, is queried: (1) (?X) The distance between the sun and the earth is X. The proposal has the attraction that it allows us to use epistemic logic to study conditions of conclusive answerhood.1 An answer is con- clusive for an inquirer H if H is, after hearing the answer, in a position to say, truly, "I know what (who, where, etc.) X is". A correct answer does not automatically fulfill this condition. For instance a (unique) definite description does not, if H does not know to whom (what, what place) it applies. Epistemic logic can clarify answerhood to questions whose semantics is sufficiently well-developed. Wh-ques- tions (who-, where-questions, etc.) are a case in point. In epistemic logic (of the type developed by Hintikka) propositions are identified as functions from possible worlds to truth-values. Knowledge is a relation which assigns to a person a and a world W a set of worlds (the a- alternatives to W) in which everything known by a in W is true. The PSA 1984, Volume 1, pp. 168-176 Copyright ? 1984 by the Philosophy of Science Association</page><page sequence="2">169 model provides an excellent tool for the study of answerhood because the entities over which the question variables (Who (where, what) is the X such that ...?) range have clear criteria of identity. I now come to one embarrassment in the logic of explanation. Granted that explanations are answers to why-questions, there still is no seman- tics for why-questions, e.g., in terms Sf possible-worlds, to match in precision the semantics of wh-questions. Search for an explanation is not search for evidence to determine which one of a set of well-defined potential answers is the actual one. But even worse, the question- operator ("Why?") ranges over causes or, more generally reasons, the identity of which is extremely vague. An answer to a who-question must specify a person to count as an answer of the right type. In contradis- tinction to this just about any syntactically well-defined proposition might be an answer to a why-question. Now assume that a querier H is in a predicament with respect to a description of a phenomenon "q". Let us represent the question which arises for H by "(?p)q(p)", where the interrogative operator "(?p)" ranges over causes or reasons. Direct answers to the question are substitution instances of what Hintikka (1976) calls the matrix of the question, i.e., "q(p)". Under what condi- tions, then, is a substitution instance of the matrix conclusive for H? Direct application of epistemic logic yields meager results, because the criteria of identity for answers are almost purely syntactic. Even the following elementary result for wh-questions fails here. A person H knows who someone is only if he can identify this individual in the various possible worlds compatible with what he knows. But often a person in a predicament knows that no answer will meet that requirement. If the description of a problematic phenomenon flatly contradicts what the person believes (or believed!), he knows that some of his background knowledge is false. But an indirect strategy might help. Explanation has to do with improvement of knowledge. Some H may find "q" problematic if it, say, contradicts his background knowledge. We have here two epistemic states, one in which H does not know that q (call this the initial epistemic state), and another one in which H knows that q but does not know why q (the problem or intermediate state). To count as conclusive for H an answer to "(?p)q(p)" must improve H's epistemic state with respect to "q", i.e., it must bring about a third epistemic state (the end state). The three epistemic states reveal in fact a conversational or illo- cutionary pattern. In the problem state H might utter a linguistic ex- pression u with the intention of getting some addressee S to provide an answer to H's question. S in his turn might utter some other u' with the intention of getting H to understand why q. What are the truth-condi- tions for "S explained to H in a problem state P why q (i.e., "(?p)q(p)") by uttering u?" Some of the necessary conditions refer to H's capacity to understand the meaning of u or its intended role in an argument for the truth of "1q". But there are two further conditions which help us to appreciate the true "logic" of why-questions. First, u must bring about an improve- ment in H's epistemic state vis-a-vis "q". Secondly, it must represent a right type of answer to "(?p)q(p)".</page><page sequence="3">170 2. Syntactic Means to Pragmatic Ends It has turned out to be extremely difficult to design a satisfactory formal model of deductive explanation (see e.g., Achinstein 1981, Hanna 1979, Stegmujller 1983 and Thorpe 1974). This embarrassment in the logic of explanation is related to the mentioned first one. Hempel's and Oppenheim's model (HO for short) was a Carnapian explication within an interpreted model language. One consequence of this approach is that it necessarily gives a static picture of explanations (as it gave of the- ories). It leaves out altogether the question of how why-questions arise, not to speak of persons or contexts. Such pragmatic matters were thought to be irrelevant for logic. Yet it is easy to see that dynamic aspects of querying and answering loomed in the background. The reason why the logic of explanation has proved to be so hard is that the formal models purport to capture dynamic pragmatic features of questions and answers by purely syntactic means. Take some examples. HO included a syntactic restriction on arguments in which the singular premiss C entails the explanandum E. Such "argu- ments" are of course self-explanations. But what are self-explanations? They are answers in which an inquirer H is offered a piece of informa- tion which he already knows. There are no pragmatic circumstances in which such an answer can improve a querier's epistemic state. Consider next what Hempel and Oppenheim called self-evidencing expla- nations, such as (2) T: (x)Mx C: Ma D Pa E: Pa According to Hempel and Oppenheim (2) is unacceptable because one can only verify the singular premiss C by verifying the explanandum E. But why the requirement of independent verification? Look at the matter from a dynamic point of view. In the problem state H knows that Pa but not why. His puzzlement needs for alleviation an explanans which gives him grounds to believe (expect) that Pa, but not all explanantia which entail "Pa" will do. No explanans which is derivable from what H already knows can improve his epistemic state with respect to the explanans. Now Hempel's and Oppenheim's reasons for rejecting (2) are in a sense an artifice of the formal setting, for it is assumed at the outset that the theory T, and hence "Ma", is true. But we can rephrase these reasons. H needs a true explanans which makes "Pa" nomically expected, without relying on what H knows already. But T&amp;C cannot do this, for the truth of the singular premiss is derived from a piece of information known to H in the problem state. The re- quirement of independent verification points to an important fact: for the explanans to be conclusive for H, it must be such that, when added to H's initial state, it would have enabled him to expect that Pa. My final example (there are more) is the famous counterexample to HD produced by Eberle et al. (1961):</page><page sequence="4">171 (3) T: (x)(y)(Fx v (Gy v Hy)) C: (Fb v Ga) D Ha E: Ha Now (3) satisfies the conditions of HO but is nevertheless a self- evidencing explanation. One way to block it was proposed by Jaegwon Kim (1963): add to HO the requirement that no conjunct in the normal form of C be entailed by H, and (3) becomes unacceptable. Hempel (1964) welcomed the device but added: it would be desirable to have a non-adhoc justification for it, one "in terms of the rationale of scientific explanation." We can see the rationale if we recall the basic dynamic feature of the question-answer model. Three epistemic states are involved. In the problem state H needs an explanans which, when added to the initial one, would enable him to predict the truth of the explanandum. Again a piece of information known to H in the problematic epistemic state cannot help H out of it. Kim's syntactic requirement rules out such information, for it brings in the role of the intermediate epistemic state. 3. Knowledge Situations and Explanatory Interests The dynamic "logic" of questions helps us to remove one difficulty in the logic of why-questions. But the syntactic mold in which HO is cast creates another one. Several writers on explanation have noted that there is, to adapt a phrase from Norwood Russell Hanson, more to a question than meets the (potential) answerer's ear. Bengt Hansson (1974) gave this observation a clear question-theoretic formulation: there is no one-one correspondence between explananda and why-questions. A querier always has in mind some contrast class or relevance relation which cannot be read from the question sentence. This means that explanation is essentially pragmatic, not so much because the selection of answers is up to the background beliefs and interests of the persons involved, but because the selection of the question is. In an attempt to get an explainee H to understand why q an explainer S must choose the utterance u in a manner which respects H's pragmatic interests and beliefs. HO and other purely syntactic-cum- semantic models are constitutionally insensitive to this requirement. To demonstrate this I shall take a look at a proposal by Peter Gardenfors (1980) (see also Stegmuller 1983) which handles the first but not the second difficulty about why-questions. Gdrdenfora identifies an inquirer H's epistemic states with quintuples of the form (4) K = &lt;U1W1{Iw}wCW,{Pw}wEW,B&gt;. Here U is a domain of individuals, W the set of possible worlds (compat- ible with what H knows), { I=)}Wan interpretation function which assigns each individual constanE 6 the language L an element from U and each predicate of L a set of individuals. {P }wCW is a probability measure for the subsets of individuals in W. Tt assigns each singular sentence in L its value in every world wEW. B is H's belief function which assigns for each subset V of W H's degree of belief that the actual world is an element of V. Now H is characteristically ignorant of the objective probabilities of different individuals' having various</page><page sequence="5">172 properties. To obtain the probability with which H expects an individual a to be a G Gardenfors resorts to mixed probabilities: The values of the measure Pw are multiplied by H's subjective probability that w is the actual world. As a result we get the following formula for expected probabilities: (5) Pv(G) = 1/B(V) L Pw(Iw(G)) B({w}). wcW Assume now that some singular sentence "q" is nomically unexpected for H at t. This means that H's initial epistemic state assigns the occurrence of the event at t+1 described by "q" a low belief value. Assume then that H observes at t+1 that q. This observation gives rise to the why-question "(?p)q(p)". What kind of an explanans would be conclusive for H? Gdrdenfors proposes that it would have to raise the belief value of "q". But raise relative to what? At t+1 H already knows that "q" is true, therefore its value is close to 1 and cannot be (substantially) raised . The other candidate is the initial epistemic state. So an explanans is conclusive for H if and onty if it raises the value of "q" relative to H's initial epistemic state? The proposal is in many respects a genuine breakthrough, for it gives a precise measure for the capacity of an explanans to make the truth of an explanandum expected. The degree of rational tension created by an explanandum is its belief value in the initial epistemic state. The relief offered by a given explanans is measured as follows: first add, by making necessary subtractions and alterations, the explanans to the initial epistemic state. Then determine the expected value of "q" in this end state and subtract from it its value in the initial one. The result tells of course how much relief you got. The model also recommends a strategy for finding the best explanans: it is the one which, when added to the initial knowledge state, maxi- mizes the belief value of "q". It also bars partial and complete self- explanations, for adding to the initial epistemic state general (and singular) sentences which are already included in the intermediate one do not improve H's epistemic state vis-a-vis "q". But it runs afoul of the other aspect. Just as there is no one-one correspondence between Hempelian explananda and why-questions, there is no such mapping from knowledge situations to why-questions. The cri- terion of identity the knowledge situations -model gives to why-ques- tions is both too fine-grained and too coarse. First, it is too fine-grained in that two persons can address the same question (be in the same intuitive "problem state") but not be in identical knowledge situations in the sense of (4). Although a belief function may in part determine the contrast class and relevance aspect, it is unrealistic to think that a change in the belief function results in a different question. For there would then be the danger that no two individuals address the same question. Secondly, two persons could be in identical knowledge situations in the sense of (4) and yet not address the same question. The best examples are singular causal queries. Two persons can agree on subjec- tive probabilities and yet select different causal antecedents as the</page><page sequence="6">173 cause. Such conflic s characteristically involve human intervention and practical interests. But also non-practical interests may have a similar effect. Members of a scientific community may share a disciplinary viewpoint which, so to say, slices the world (or a particular portion thereof) in a certain way. A potential answer which does not match that viewpoint may be type- inappropriate, and in that sense, an answer to the wrong question. 4. Pragmatic Presuppositions and Theories This observation gives the logic of why-questions further content. Why-questions, we saw, cannot be directly modelled after wh-questions. But the weak logic of question-answers sequences can be supplemented with constraints provided by pragmatic "presuppositions". Belnap and Steel (1976) write that questions characteristically include contextual completeness and distinctness requirements. Pragmatic presuppositions built into why-questions have an analogous role. It is natural to think that these presuppositions are derived from theories. To the extent there are, say, Kuhnian disciplinary matrixes, there can be well- entrenched (and not always propositional) presuppositions which struc- ture the why-questions of a given field; they mark out gaps in the available body of knowledge. Two inquirers who hold different theories might then literally ask different questions even though they would use the same surface why-question. It is to be noted that disciplinary matrices may involve not just beliefs but also interests. There may then be more to a Kuhnian problem than is built into a knowledge situation in the sense of (4). Why-questions, then, are abstract 8entities, individuated in part by the elements of a disciplinary matrix. The explicit question-theoretic setting helps us to use Kuhn's ideas to overcome the difficulty in why- questions. Once we do have a potential answer to a why-question, we can apply epistemic logic, gs Hintikka suggests, to examine its conclusive- ness for an inquirer H. For H is in a position truly to say "I know why q" only if the answer does not clash with H's paradigmatic back- ground assumptions, only if H knows the-relevant terms in the answer (i.e., only if H understands the answer), and only if H understands its intended role in the complete argument for "q". Another remarkable consequence is that there are no interesting necessary and sufficient conditions for scientific explanation. An answer is pragmatically adequate for some H if it improves H's problem state with respect to an explanandum. But if we study the truth condi- tions for "S explained to H in a problem state P why q by uttering u", we only get the weak constraints imposed by the logic of question-answer -sequences. For instance the requirement (built into Gardenfors' propo- sal) that an explanans must increase the belief value of the explanandum does not cover all why-questions - precisely because problem states are not identical with knowledge situations (in the sense of (4)). The knowledge situations -model only handles why-questions in which "q" needs explanation because it was unexpected, given the initial epistemic state. And even this does not hold without qualification: an answer may increase the belief value of "q" in a type-inappropriate way and there- fore be unexplanatory.</page><page sequence="7">174 This result provides more grist to the mills of those who are suspi- cious of general metatheoretic explications. Explanations form a loose family of concepts, tied together by the thin thread of the logic of question-answer sequences. There can then be field- or theory-specific studies which provide more substantive accounts. Notes 1See Hintikka (1981a) and (1981b). For the use of epistemic logic to clarify answerhood see also Aqvist (1965). 2For the hazier semantics of why-questions, see Hintikka (1976, 2.7.) and Belnap and Steel (1976, pp. 84-87). 3For the logical form of why-questions, see Achinstein (1977), Tuomela (1980) and van Fraassen (1980). 4We should note that there may be acceptable answers which do draw on what the speaker knows in the initial epistemic state, if the answer, so to say, brings to the querier's attention the relevance of a piece of information "implicitly" known by him. For this, see Hintikka (1981b). 5I have taken the liberty to use StegmUller's (1983) explicit formula- tion of Gardenfors' notion as a quintuple. Note that Gardenfors works with statistical frequences and does not require that lawlike sentences are involved. It seems that a requirement of lawlike sentences must be added because nomic unexpectedness, not unexpectedness as such, marks most prominent cases of surprise. In any case laws are needed for rational improvement of epistemic states. However, I shall not go into this issue here. 60ne of Gardenfors' ideas is that explanantia may have explanatory power even if they do not suffice for prediction. It is enough that they increase belief value, not that they raise it above, say, .5. 7For examples, see Girill (1977). 8See van Fraassen (1980, Chapter 5). van Fraassen analyzes why-ques- tions as ordered triples Q=&lt;Pk,X,R&gt; in which Pk is what erotetic lo- gicians call the presupposition (van Fraassen's topic), X a contrast class, and R a relevance relation. Now he thinks that explanations are applications of science, not pure science, and hence that the X's and R's may come from extra-scientific human concerns. I have here wanted to stress disciplinary matrixes which need not involve any necessarily anthropomorphic points of view. 9I should add here that Hintikka (1981b) has developed his question- answer model into a dynamic direction by using models of information- seeking dialogues. I have wished to stress the speech act theoretic setting, for it seems to be the best way to present the way members of a scientific community can draw on mutually shared presuppositions.</page><page sequence="8">175 References Achinstein, Peter.
