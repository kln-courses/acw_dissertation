<plain_text><page sequence="1">Making Images/Making Bodies: Visibilizing and Disciplining through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Amit Prasad University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign This article analyzes how the medical gaze made possible by MRI operates in radiologi- cal laboratories. It argues that although computer-assisted medical imaging technolo- gies such as MRI shift radiological analysis to the realm of cyborg visuality, radiological analysis continues to depend on visualization produced by other technologies and diag- nostic inputs. In the radiological laboratory, MRI is used to produce diverse sets of images of the internal parts of the body to zero in and visually extract the pathology (or prove its nonexistence). Visual extraction of pathology becomes possible, however, because of the visual training of the radiologists in understanding and interpreting ana- tomic details of the whole body. These two levels of viewing constitute the bifocal vision of the radiologists. To make these levels of viewing work complementarily, the body, as it is presented in the body atlases, is made notational (i.e., converted into a set of isolable, disjoint, and differentiable parts). Keywords: MRI; medical gaze; cyborg visuality; bifocal gaze; differential viewing Computer-assisted medical imaging technologies, which emerged during the 1970s and thereafter, are very often argued to have created a visuality in which the human body seems to have lost its materiality and become a visual medium (Balsamo 1996). Even though the scope of this visuality is not dis- puted, debates have continued over how, if at all, it differs from visualization produced by earlier nondigital imaging technologies.' In this article, I analyze AUTHOR'S NOTE: I wish to thank Geoffrey Bowker, Indranil Dutta, James Elkins, Michael Goldman, Andrew Pickering, Srirupa Prasad, John Wedge, and the three anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

Moreover, it continues to depend on other visualization technologies and diagnostic inputs in fixing biological reality and detecting pathology. Nonetheless, a change in the nature and sta- tus of the image radically alters the mechanics and architecture of the medical gaze, shifting it to a new visual regime3 that should be appropriately called cyborg visuality.4 In the radiological laboratory, MRI is used to produce diverse sets of images, which configure the human body in different ways in the process of detecting pathology. Any spatially variable data that are measurable can be used to produce visual reconfigurations of the object/body. For example, MR images are computer-generated visual reconfigurations of physical data such as the relaxation times of hydrogen atoms that are found abundantly in the body.5 These images should truly be called image data because they can con- veniently slide between being data or images.6 Scientists themselves agree that these images are models of reality, which are "once or even twice removed from reality" (Kassirer 1992, 829). Nonetheless, in the radiological laboratory, images are the sites for excavating biological reality/pathology.7 No attempt is made to produce one perfect MR image that can then be used to detect pathology. Each of the nearly 100 MR images that are produced in the radiological laboratory, very much like the figure of cyborg that Donna Haraway (1991) invoked, presents a partial perspective of the internal part of the body that is under focus. Practitioners seek to locate pathology through a "differential analysis" of these diverse sets of MR images. This differential analysis/viewing is possi- ble because of a dynamic interaction between the scientist/radiologist and the image data that would not be possible without the help of a computer. The construction of new images using MRI is intrinsic to the radiological inter- pretative process. Closure on pathology is achieved, however, not only through differential analysis of the images but also through cross-referencing different "inscriptions"-images, diagnostic data, and so on, which together constitute the radiological gaze and function to detect and fix pathology. The radiological gaze of MRI, not unlike any other medical gaze, has a "bifocal vision." The differential analysis of diverse sets of MR images in the radiological laboratory is limited to focusing and visually extracting particu- lar anatomic details that can be useful in detecting (or eliminating the possi- bility of) pathology. Radiologists are not interested in deciphering the ana- tomic details of the body (or even the particular part of the body that is under focus) completely. Yet this focusing is possible because of the visual training</page><page sequence="3">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 293 of radiologists in understanding and interpreting the anatomic details of the whole body, for which MRI and other standard anatomic body atlases serve as useful tools. To make these two levels of viewing work complementarily, the body, as it is presented in the body atlases, is made notational (i.e., con- verted into sets of isolable, disjoint, and differentiable parts). This process allows radiologists to visually extract the pathology without worrying about the complete anatomic details of the body part that is being examined. Development of imaging techniques allows for the production of new images that represent further reconfigurations of the body and thereby fur- ther extend the medical gaze. There is, however, a continuous effort by the medical community to discipline MR images and through them the human body. Any emergent new piece of information is sooner or later disciplined. Nonetheless, the process of detecting/fixing pathology remains contingent and dependent on the interactive stabilization of cross-referential elements that constitute the diagnostic process. Fixing pathology in the radiological laboratory continues to be bricolage, and open-endedness is inherent in this process. Fixing Pathology/Biological Reality in the Radiological Laboratory The MRI machine consists of a long tube that is surrounded by a large doughnut-shaped magnet.8 In the radiological laboratory, a technologist operates the machine.9 She or he puts the patient inside the MRI after strap- ping a coil over the body part that is to be imaged. These coils are specially designed for particular body parts (for example, there are head or torso coils) so as to optimally collect signals of particular positional parameters, such as relaxation times or proton density, from inside the body. These signals are thereafter converted to images with the help of a computer after numerous acts of "shifting" and "working on."'0 The images produced by MRI "have no straightforward relationship to the way the body looks to the unaided eyes, and demand considerable interpretive skill and training for technicians and specialists before they can be reliably used for clinical purposes" (Waldby 2000, 28). Fortunately for the technologists and radiologists, standard image construction protocols or techniques are already stored in the computer. Technologists and radiologists have to, however, regularly upgrade their "viewing" skills because new MR imaging techniques are continually being developed. The technologist, after preparing the patient for imaging, moves into an adjacent room where a computer is located. These two rooms have a glass</page><page sequence="4">294 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values window between them so that the technologist can observe the patient while operating the computer. The patient also has a microphone inside the MRI tube through which she or he and the technologist can communicate during the imaging process. The visualization of biological reality/pathology through MRI requires the cooperation of the patient too. Even though imag- ing protocols average out the effect of electronic noise and have techniques to remove or minimize the effect of physiological motion inside the patient's body, the patient has to keep absolutely still while the data are being col- lected. This is because even the slightest movement on the part of the patient leads to the production of artifacts. During MRI radiological analysis, images of only a small part of the body are produced.'1 The physician decides which part of the body has to be imaged on the basis of her or his initial diagnosis of the patient's ailments. The radiologist (if the physician is not her or himself analyzing the images) receives a small note with demographic data of the patient, a brief statement on the diagnosis of the patient until then (sometimes, a short history of diag- nosis is provided, particularly if a change in disease pattern has to be fol- lowed), and which body part needs to be imaged. The radiologist decides which imaging techniques will be used in the production of MR images. The technologist is not, however, an automaton. She or he has to make decisions on where to focus so that the anatomical part that is of concern comes out clearly in the field of view of the machine. In one case, when a technologist was imaging a patient's ankle, she realized that there was some- thing unusual at its lower edge. As she shifted the focus, a large blob came into her view, which was later identified to be a blood clot and the source of the patient's pain. In special cases, the technologist may ask the radiologist to use contrast agents or make additional sets of images by using different techniques. Usually, sets of around 20 images of proton density, T,, and T2 weighted images are produced for two of the three possible sections or planes-axial, coronal, and sagittal.12 The 20 or so images are of a particular slice thickness, for example 4 millimeters, and are sequentially taken from top to bottom, right to left, or anterior to posterior of the particular body part that is imaged.13 Altogether, around 120 images (20 images each of two sections for each of the three types: 20 x 2 x 3 = 120) are produced, comprising different sections, different types (e.g., TI, T2, and proton density images), and differ- ent slices. Even though these images are two-dimensional, because they are images of contiguous slices of a body part from one end to the other and are taken in more than one plane, together they provide a three-dimensional view of that body part (see Figure 1).</page><page sequence="5">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 295 Figure 1. Axial T1 inagys of the brain taken sequentially at 4 mm thickness. These inages, as we move from left to right and then to the following row, provide sequential views of two-dimensional slices of the brain as seen from the top of the head. SOURCE: I wish to thank Rakesh Gupta and Rajesh Verma of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute (SGPGI), Lucknow, India, for providing me with these images. The images are printed out instantly and checked to see if they have any blurring. The image data are not, however, deleted from the computer imme- diately. Instead, these data are preserved for a few days on the radiologists' computer to aid in creating some other reconfigurations of the body if there is I I</page><page sequence="6">296 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values any need to do so. These MR images at first glance look similar to X-ray images. Nonetheless, MR images are intrinsically different because MRI visualization does not involve "seeing" in the traditional sense, because it is not based on the reflection or absorption of light or other electromagnetic waves. 14 A technologist or radiologist may be able to determine if there is some- thing wrong or at least deviant by comparing these MR images with the images of normal or pathological anatomy that she or he knows through body atlases.'5 A considerable interpretative difference can exist at this juncture. For example, in one case of imaging of the throat of a child, a large lump was visible. The technologists and the radiologist could not decide if it was an infection or a tumor. What I wish to point out is that even though MRI pro- duces perhaps the most sensitive images of the internal parts of the body, detection of pathology is not straightforward. It is only through differential analysis of the images and their cross-referencing with other diagnostic inputs that the radiologist moves toward some kind of closure. The sets of images for different sections and types are then sent to the radi- ologist who puts them on a large display board, analyzes them, and thereafter records her or his findings. Displaying all the images together on the display board allows the radiologist to focus her or his gaze and differentially analyze these images at several levels. The radiologist knows what to look for because of the questions that the physician has posed in the note on her or his diagnosis of the patient. Unless something striking is seen in the images, the radiologist limits her or his "seeing" to the questions posed by the physician. She or he also looks at the images in comparison to each other. A comparison of the images on different planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) can help in fix- ing the extent of deviation from what is known to constitute the normal and the pathological. For example, a sagittal section of spinal cord can show whether the different bones constituting it are compressed or possibly bro- ken. The axial section, on the other hand, can show whether such compres- sion or breaking is causing a blockage of the spinal cord (see Figure 2). A third level of comparison is the elimination of the possibility that the deviance seen in the body part is from an artifact. This is achieved by compar- ing blurred or unusual appearances on the images with a catalogue of MRI artifacts. A comparison of different MR images can also show whether there is an artifact if blurring or ghosts are consistently seen in a particular set of them and have the same form. Yet one can never be completely sure that what was seen in the images was not an artifact. Another level of comparison is among T,, T2, and proton density images. By comparing the contrasting images of T, and T2, the radiologist can move further toward a particular interpretation.16 Cancerous lesions appear dark on T, images and bright on</page><page sequence="7">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 297 Figure 2. The image on the left is a sagitlal MRI scan of lumbar vertebra. On the right is an axial (i.e., on a plane perpendicular to sagittal, a view from top to butloin of spinal cord) MRI scan of lumbar spine. These two images are only single slices from respective sections (or planes). As I have shown earlier (see Figure 1), images are taken at a particular thickness (e.g., 4 mm.) from one end to the other in that section, mak- ing the part of spinal cord under focus completely visible in that plane.

T2 images, thereby allowing a differential viewing of the pathology (see Fig- ure 3). Sometimes, a comparison is made between images taken at different points of time. The purpose of such comparisons is to follow the life cycle of a disease diachronically. For example, this process is used to monitor whether a cancerous lump is increasing, decreasing, or remaining unchanged as the treatment progresses. At any level of comparison, if anything signifi- cantly different is seen from the normal anatomy as is known through the body atlases, more comparisons are made. Conversely, if the radiologist feels that she or he is sure there is or there is not a possibility of pathology, she or he may stop the cross-referential process. Very often, a schematic diagram of the body part that is under focus is present along with the MR images to aid in radiological analysis. Body atlases, which contain standardized MR and schematic images of the normal and the pathological anatomy, form the ideal type for cross-referencing dur- ing the process of detection of pathology. These body atlases, through experi- ence and instruction, become a part of the radiologists' memory.'7 They are not, however, directly consulted at each level of comparison because</page><page sequence="8">298 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Figure 3.

Runge, Clinical MRI (7), copyright 2002, with permission from Elsevier. individual variations in anatomy that the radiologist sees can be very differ- ent from the "standardized" representations of the human anatomy in the body atlases. The primary role of body atlases is to provide an encompassing view of the human anatomy, which helps the radiologist in visually extract- ing the pathology. If, however, some significantly different normal or patho- logical variations are observed, sooner or later they get archived, thus becom- ing a part of the encompassing viewing of the body. Nonetheless, analysis of images remains contingent because it is based on the existing state of medical knowledge and practices. As new "facts" emerge, the analysis also changes.18 A significant characteristic of the cyborg visuality of MRI is that new imaging techniques are continually developed to produce further reconfigu- rations of the body. Even though these reconfigurations are produced in the form of images, they become possible because of their existence as image data. For example, in cases when pathology is not visible because of the body's fat content, the radiologist can ask for the production of images that exclude this fat by using imaging techniques that suppress the signals from fat.19 Unlike other medical imaging technologies, which depend on a single parameter to produce images of internal parts of the body, MRI can use</page><page sequence="9">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 299 multiple parameters such as relaxation times, proton density, or diffusion of blood or other fluids for image production.20 As new imaging techniques are developed for MRI, the network of cross-referencing and differential view- ing that constitutes its radiological gaze are extended further. For example, magnetization transfer technique is now being used to transfer magnetization from atoms such as carbon to hydrogen, and then to measure these data to produce images.21 Numerous other techniques are continually being devel- oped for the purpose of pathology detection using MRI. We have to keep in mind, however, that these different levels of comparison are neither exhaustively used nor follow any particular sequential order in radiological analysis. The choice of particular imaging techniques and comparisons is based on need (for example, for a particular disease), time, and cost of analysis. The radiologist can develop other levels of comparison if she or he is not sure of what she or he is seeing. Computers allow a dynamic interaction of the radiologist with the image data, which are preserved until the radiological analysis of that particular case is complete. The radiologist can use the con- trast between different shades of gray that a computer can offer for black and white images to produce images for further cross-referencing. A perfect black and white contrast shows the bones very clearly, but the tissues sur- rounding the bones may not be clearly visible. The radiologist can dynami- cally alter the shades of gray to locate the pathology. This process is called windowing. The radiologist can also make comparisons by changing the con- trast of gray in a particular region of the image through a process that is called leveling. The logic behind making these and other comparisons is, as Francoise Bastide said, to eliminate everything that does not change and to channel the gaze "toward the differences that are the only pertinent details" (1990, 201). From the examples I have provided, it may seem that the cross-referential network used in fixing pathology through differential analysis is contained within the radiological laboratories. This, however, is not true. The cross- referential process through which pathology is fixed extends beyond the radiological laboratory. For example, in the case of the analysis of MR images by radiologists and physicians, the "social" is embedded in their gazes at least at two levels. First, the radiologists (and doctors) have statistical data on the incidence of disease with respect to age, sex, and other demo- graphics. So a radiologist looking for brain tumor, for example, is much more careful if the patient is older than thirty-five because the chances of having brain tumors increases significantly after this age. In other words, the radiol- ogist tunes her or his gaze according to the epidemiological information on sex, race, and age. Second, the body atlases that are either directly used or</page><page sequence="10">300 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values serve as mnemonics to interpret MR images most often embody the demo- graphic variations of the body parts as averaged anatomic variations in the society. Statistical data on the incidence of diseases in the society, and the variation of internal body parts (as seen in the atlases), serve as another level of cross-referencing in the process of fixing pathology. These different levels of comparison do not just serve the purpose of con- firming what is seen in the image. Rather, they help in constituting the gaze. For example, in one case, MR images of a person's knee were being ana- lyzed, and the only information given to the radiologist was a complaint of knee pain by the patient and an X-ray image of the knee taken more than twenty years ago. The radiologist could not fix the pathology and had to ask the physician for more information on the diagnosis. When asked whether he could see if there was anything unusual with the knee, the radiologist said he could, but that might not be pathological. Apart from showing how cross- referentiality makes seeing possible, this example also illustrates that the radiologist does not attempt to completely define the body part whose images are being analyzed. Her or his aim is limited to "zero in" on the pathology (or its nonexistence) through a differential analysis of the images. Moreover, it also shows that the cross-referential network through which pathology is fixed is open-ended and the closure that is achieved is always conditional, limited, and exists only so long as it dovetails with other findings and avail- able data.22 Can one be sure that these comparisons will lead to a single conclusive and right interpretation of the images? The statement of one of the radiologists illustrates what kind of closure one can at best achieve by analyzing MR images. According to him, "MRI images can give a perfect positive test but a perfect negative test is not possible." He explained further, "I can prove that you have cancer by taking a piece of cancer [tissue] and looking under a microscope but I can't prove you don't [have cancer]" (emphasis added). The statement of the radiologist basically implies that pathology can be conclu- sively shown only if it is seen. The only way to find out if the radiologists are right about the interpretation of MR images is by further extending the cross- referential network by producing further MR reconfigured images or through visualization by other imaging techniques-X-ray, computed tomo- graphy (CT) scan, ultrasound, and so on-and/or other diagnostic tools (e.g., a blood test). It is, however, not necessary (and also not possible) for the radi- ologist (or the physician) to comprehensively do cross-referencing at all the possible levels to come to a judgment. Cross-referencing can get extended, leading to the detection of pathology (or normality) accidentally, while</page><page sequence="11">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 301 diagnosing some other ailment or if the patient continues to have complaints with regard to her or his health. In the case of Jackie Stacey, a CT scan had shown a cyst on her ovary and a "bulky uterus" more than three years after her last treatment. She wrote, I may have been in two minds about whether the cyst they indicated was visible was benign or malignant, but it never occurred to me that the scan reading might be mistaken. As it transpired, on further inspection with ultrasound, there proved to be nothing "abnormal" at all: the radiologist had probably "overread the image." (Stacey 1997, 152) She went on to state, "This experience should come as no surprise to those sceptical about the reliability of visual evidence, and yet my own confusion and disbelief revealed an unexpected trust in scientific imaging technologies to tell me the truth about my body" (Stacey 1997, 152). One cannot fail to notice that the trust as well as the distrust of Stacey toward scientific images is based on results obtained by medical imaging technologies (her distrust in the reading of the CT image is based on the read- ing of ultrasound). Nonetheless, irrespective of different levels of cross- referentiality possible through MRI and other imaging technologies, one cannot be completely assured of the truth of the predictions based on them. Even if we exclude the role of individual judgment in the detection (or elimi- nation of the possibility) of pathology, the process still remains conditional and contingent on the available state of knowledge and expertise about the body, pathology, imaging techniques, different parts of the technological assemblage, and so on. One of the ways by whiclf the medical community strives to eliminate this open-endedness is by seeking to discipline the images and through that the human body. In the next section, I will show how the human anatomy is sought to be domesticated in the process of creating a clear and singular pic- ture of the normal and the pathological. Before I begin, I wish to emphasize that the process of domestication of images and anatomy that I am going to analyze in the next section does not sequentially follow radiologists' work. Domesticated images are already there in front of the radiologists in the form of an atlas of body parts that includes MR images together with diagrammatic representations of the human anatomy developed with the help of different instruments and procedures. They, together with the differential analysis to zero in on the pathology, constitute the bifocal vision of the radiological analysis.</page><page sequence="12">302 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Domesticating MR Images and the Human Anatomy Increased visibilization does not directly translate into a more effective medical gaze. Images have to be disciplined before they can be used as good exemplars to represent anatomy and identify pathology. The case of the Visi- ble Human Project (VHP) undertaken by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Maryland, at the initiative of the U.S. federal government to develop whole-body digitized images of a man and a woman to serve as gold stan- dards for comparing the human anatomy, exemplifies my contention.23 VHP, which consists of images produced by digital photography, MRI, and CT, is also illustrative of the new visual regime that I have called cyborg visuality: The Visible Man consists of 24-bit digitized computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and photographic images of over 1,800 1.0-millimeter cross- sectional slices of a male corpse, and the Visible Woman is composed of 5,000 images of .33-millimeter slices of a female corpse. (Cartwright 1998, 25) In the past few years, a number of research groups from all over the world have used the VHP, which NLM has made available for a small licensing fee, to further develop visual models of the anatomy and functions of the human body. Before analyzing the VHP as anatomical maps, I will throw light on some of VHP's characteristics to highlight that the medical visualization pro- duced by computer-assisted technologies such as MRI represents a new visuality not just because it is digitally recorded. NLM, in its description of the VHP, refers to the images produced by all three modalities-MRI, CT Scan, and digital photography-as image data. The existence of VHP as image data not only allows a dynamic interaction of the observer with the VHP but also makes possible the production of dynamic representations of the human body such as that of physiological functions, and the dynamic exchange (through e-mails) of these representa- tions across the globe. Digital recording, therefore, does not merely change the way images are produced, but also changes the relationship between human beings and machines and allows representational possibilities that are unimaginable without the help of a computer. The use of three different digital imaging modalities allows for compari- son among the images produced by three different technologies. These images are not, however, directly comparable. They have to be transformed through a process that is called "registration of images" to make them compa- rable. Again, the use of computers and the existence of images as image data are intrinsic to such transformations.</page><page sequence="13">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 303 Just because the images produced by the three modalities are digital, how- ever, does not mean that they have the same status. NLM's own descriptions of the VHP betray the equivalence of these three types of images. In a section entitled "Image Data and How to Obtain It," NLM's description states, "The initial aim of the Visible Human Project is to create a digital image dataset of complete human male and female cadavers in MRI, CT, and anatomical modes" (emphasis added).24 That is, peering into the corpse by imaging its sliced cross-sections is considered anatomical representations (anatomical mode is referring to digital photography) and is distinguishable from MRI and CT images. Such a distinction between MRI and CT images and digital photographs is logical when seen in the light of Michel Foucault's (1994) analysis of the clinical medical gaze. According to Foucault, "The great break in the history of Western medicine dates precisely from the moment clinical experience became the anatomo-clinical gaze," which occurred when death no longer remained an absolute beyond for biomedicine and corpses were opened to study the human anatomy (Foucault 1994, 146). Catherine Waldby, follow- ing Foucault, wrote, "The corpse, rather than the living body, is central to the production of anatomical working objects, and hence to anatomical knowl- edge more generally" (Waldby 2000, 29). Technically, however, it is possible to produce MRI and CT images of the VHP from a living body. That is to say, even though MRI and CT images of the VHP were produced from corpses, they do not have an umbilical connection with the dead body. Cyborg visuality produced by MRI and CT, therefore, in contrast to the clinical medical gaze that Foucault (1994) described, need not peer into the dead body to visualize life. Digital cross-sections of sliced body parts are, however, intrinsic to the process of constituting "objective facts" about the human body, even when this process occurs in the realm of cyborg visuality. Faith in MRI and CT images emerged by comparing them with already known anatomical "facts." The coexistence of the VHP "in MRI, CT, and anatomical modes," which have been "registered" to make them comparable, is reflective of the wider symbiotic relationship between cyborg visuality and the already existing clinical medical gaze in constituting biological reality. Nevertheless, cyborg visuality produced by MRI or CT Scan is not, as Michael Lynch argued, a "digital simulation of photographic realism" (Lynch 1991, 73). In spite of the fact that the VHP provides the most detailed and sensitive images of the human body in three different modalities, it still requires disci- plining of the images/body to make itself useful as a body atlas. The aim of the VHP has been, as Toga and Maziotta stated, "to create an example of the</page><page sequence="14">304 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values species as a map" (2000, 14). Visible Man and Visible Woman are supposed to be examples of human species that are closest to living human beings yet allow peering into different tissues, bones, blood vessels, and other constitu- ents of the body. NLM made VHP publicly available without labeling the images of the anatomical parts. The aim of NLM was to encourage scientists to use VHP to develop anatomical atlases or use it for other possible func- tions. At present, several projects have spawned all over the world that use the VHP for a wide variety of purposes. In the beginning, however, the most important failing of the VHP was that the images did not have any labeling indicating which organ is where in the images. The statement of Michael J. Ackerman, the project officer of the VHP at the NLM, best exemplifies the paradox that the Visible Man and Visi- ble Woman had created. According to him, "[It] is like having books lying all over the place [library] not indexed or catalogued" (quoted in Cartwright 1998, 36). Visible Man and Visible Woman are good examples of a new visuality in which human bodies have become, as Anne Balsamo (1996) said, a visual medium. Nonetheless, this increased visualization did not directly translate into a more effective gaze: for the VHP to be successful as anatomi- cal maps, the images had to be "disciplined." The problem, with visualization in medical science, of which the VHP can perhaps be seen as the best exemplar, is that it is caught between two irrecon- cilable tensions. First, as Michel Foucault (1994) showed to us, the anatomi- cal mapping of diseases onto the body, as it happens for biomedical practice in the West, essentially relies on the visualization of the body.25 Visualization necessarily entails being able to produce pictures of the internal parts of the body. Pictures are, however, as James Elkins said, "the strongest agents for the corruption of meaning" (1999, 240). With pictures, there can always be an overflow of meaning leading to a destabilization of a singular and conclusive interpretation of the images. Second, even though these pictures are supposed to represent what is there in the body, there is no "original copy" with codes to interpret them, such that one can arrive at one fixed interpretation. Any picture that medical science can make will require some level of "shifting" (Latour 1999). Medical sci- ence representations, therefore, are produced as "similitudes" to other such representations, as seen through a cross-referential network, but are argued to be a "resemblance" of an "original copy" whose marks and traces, which are seen through cross-referencing, become "signatures" of the "original copy."26 Medical science seeks to overcome these tensions through two related processes-cross-referencing and converting the image into a set of nota- tions-so that some kind of closure over interpretation is achieved. In the</page><page sequence="15">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 305 previous section, I have shown how pathology is fixed through cross- referencing. In the following, I will show how the medical gaze is disciplined through training to allow the visual reading of MR image/body as a set of nota- tions. I am using the term notation here in the sense James Elkins uses it, for "an image employing organizational principles other than the formats associ- ated with pictures and writing systems, especially reference lines and other geometric configurations" (1999, 257).27 The effort is to make the MR image/body semantically (i.e., in terms of meaning) and syntactically (i.e., different parts seen in relation to other parts and the whole body) differentia- ble and unambiguous. Any difference in the body/image from what is pre- sented through the body atlases signifies abnormality/pathology. MR images are not, however, inherently notational. Images of the body are cartographed to serve as navigational maps to explore the human anat- omy and detect pathology. Reference lines and geometrical configurations are imposed to domesticate the images and along with it the human anatomy in such a way that each part of the image/body becomes isolable and multiple interpretations or unexplainable structures can be avoided or removed.28 This allows the radiologist to extract particular anatomic details of the body part in focus without worrying about the complete anatomy that is seen in the image. One can see evidence of such a method of interpretation if one observes the radiologist interpreting MR images. She or he records her or his interpreta- tion of different parts of the body as seen in the images, not in the order of contiguity of different parts of the body but as though these body parts were disjoint and isolable from each other. Viewing of body parts as isolable and separable from the whole body is also a part of the visual learning of human anatomy in the medical school. Byron Good mentioned a case that medical students at Harvard found most shocking: the body prepared for the dissection of genitalia was "sawn in half above the waist, then bisected between the legs. Students described their shock ... at [the] dismemberment that crossed natural boundaries" (Good 1994, 73). Visual training of the radiologist involves learning to see how the human anatomy looks on MR images. MR body atlases with images of the normal anatomy and their pathological variations serve as useful tools in the process of visual learning of the human anatomy by the radiologists. Codification of MR images and along with it the human anatomy such that they could be read like notations is achieved through cross-referencing with already archived knowledge about the human body and is learned by the radiologists and phy- sicians in the medical school. For example, consider the axial MR image of basal ganglia and its diagrammatic representation (see Figure 4).</page><page sequence="16">306 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values An t"n to-vii t-t I'ad -.a branrdt ?r?Cnlwis G {;hi?su"m SrkSts c (3t_. . aufm nnal~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~cq, rlwr ~ai " '" ham uEr .' / o I f n 1uta s '__m.r, . ,d_ ..PfrmTq ?.~ | _ ^-E ^~~~[k~ur 1 ] tisr 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~S~~ris D F s rs; ffi~~~~~~~~~~~~~nfu txfrrrr - ! t-q _ nf W~~~~~~~~SXtrwt~ )bwrsz Tc.ii nucde w Figure 4.

This text precisely explains the different parts and where they are located in the image/body. Most often, such an accompa- nying text is not even written in complete sentences. The aim is obviously to reduce/eliminate the metaphoricity of not only pictures but also writing. The diagrammatic representation is formed by putting together information obtained through different processes, including surgical and imaging tech- niques. In this editing process, all that cannot be accounted for is removed and different parts that constitute the image/body are clearly marked out. It is obvious that the diagrammatic representation forms the reference category. The schematic images are made in such a way that each part becomes isolable and differentiable; the blurring between the contiguous parts that is seen in the MR images is not evident at all in the diagrammatic representations of the body atlases. Seeing the diagrammatic representation, one may feel that after all there may be an "original copy" of the human body that, despite being constructed with the help of different imaging techniques, can serve as the reference copy against which all human bodies can be studied. The body, however, cannot be so easily domesticated.29 In practice, besides individual differences in human anatomy, significant anatomical variability is also found with respect to demographic factors such as gender or age, and genetic factors such as handedness (Toga and Maziotta 2000). This variability in human anatomy poses its own problems in the analyz- ing and disciplining of the images/human body.30 Anatomical variability is sought to be domesticated by using probability maps (images on which one can see anatomical variability probabilistically) through which one can find the probability of occurrence of a certain anatomical part in a particular region on the image (see Figure 5). In the probability image shown in Figure 5, if one points the cursor at the position shown by the cross (on the top image in the figure), the computer tells that there is a 75 percent chance of that part being thalamus, around 25 percent of it being putamen, and very little chance of it being caudate. Proba- bility images are usually color coded so that they can be more easily deci- phered. These probability maps (or probabilistic body atlases) numerically show the anatomic variations on pictures so that one can distinguish normal from abnormal and pathological variations. Even though body parts in these atlases are isolable only probabilistically, the aim is still to make them isolable and differentiable as far as possible.31 In the case of MR images, even when medical scientists or radiologists do mathematization and geometrization, it is not to make them mathematically accessible to impose a natural order.32 Mathematization, as for example in the</page><page sequence="18">308 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Figure 5.

Mazziotta, Brain Mapping: The Methods (21), copyright 2000, with permission from Elsevier. case of probabilistic body atlases, is used to separate the part (e.g., the thalamus) from the whole (the brain), even though it is only in probabilistic terms. Mathematical techniques are also used during radiological analysis to measure the extent of pathology. In the analyses of MR images to represent anatomy and pathology in the radiological laboratory or for pedagogical pur- poses, the aim of using mathematical and geometrical techniques is to make the images mosaics of differentiable and identifiable parts so that confusions in interpretations can be avoided. Despite all these efforts at domesticating I I</page><page sequence="19">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 309 the image/human anatomy, however, body atlases become at most ideal types, and interpretation of MR images to discern pathology requires another round of cross-referencing, as I have shown in the first section. Conclusion The emergence of computer-assisted medical imaging technologies such as MRI has often been hailed as marking the birth of an era in which the medi- cal gaze seems to be on its way to revealing all the deep secrets of the human body. These imaging technologies are being extensively used to detect pathology and, as Barbara Stafford (1991) said, to convert the "internal depths of the body" to "visual surfaces." In significant ways, they are also ushering new ways of seeing the world and human existence.33At the same time, claims about the artificiality of these images, such as those that Jackie Stacey (1997) raised, are not unusual. In this article, I have analyzed the med- ical gaze produced by MRI in the radiological laboratories. I have argued that MRI shifts the medical gaze to a new visual regime within which not only the roles of humans and machines in the production of images have changed but also the nature and status of the image, and hence visualization produced by MRI should be appropriately called cyborg visuality. If we follow the trajectory of production, domestication, and use of MR images, some aspects of the medical gaze produced by them become evident. MRI radiological gaze is not constituted by a single act of "seeing" and its representation in a single exemplary image of the body. In fact, the produc- tion of images by MRI does not involve any "seeing." MRI produces diverse sets of images by converting physical data such as relaxation times into spa- tial maps of internal parts of the body with the help of computers. The pres- ence of MR images as image data allows an almost unlimited extension of the medical gaze. MRI's sensitivity as a diagnostic imaging technique lies in its ability to produce different reconfigurations of the body, which provide the basis for a differential viewing of the body. Differential viewing allows radi- ologists to visually extract only those anatomic details that are useful for "zeroing in" on the pathology. Nonetheless, zeroing in is possible not only because of differential view- ing but also because this gaze is bifocal. Visual learning of anatomic atlases by radiologists, which work as mnemonics when the radiologists are trying to fix pathology, provides them with an encompassing visual picture of the whole body. The conversion of MR images of the human anatomy to a set of notations makes this bifocal viewing easier: radiologists can sift out the part (pathology) from the whole (the body) more conveniently because the body</page><page sequence="20">310 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values is already converted into isolable and differentiable parts in this process. Yet, as I show in this article, in spite of increased visibility and domestication of the body (that helps in the tuning as well as making of the gaze), the process of detecting/fixing pathology remains open ended, and any closure that is achieved is conditional and contingent. In the cyborg visual regime, images have become bits of data in cybers- pace that can be, and are, manipulated by human beings. This does not mean that within this new visual regime, claims toward realism of images are dis- banded. If that were so, there would be no reason to have MRI radiological analyses. Cyborg visuality produced by MRI works within a different framework of realism that does not seek "mechanical reproduction" of the observed object(s). MR images produce different reconfigurations of the body, each of which provide a partial perspective of the body and together they constitute the MR radiological gaze. Nonetheless, even though MRI shifts the medical gaze to the realm of cyborg visuality, MRI radiological gaze continues to feed on the already existing visual knowledge of the body and other diagnostic inputs, and in the process further increases the scope of the medical gaze. Notes 1. Digital imaging has been the object of many analyses. Fred Ritchin (1991), not unlike many other scholars, argued that the emergence of digital photography marks an end of photo- graphic realism as we have known it. According to William Mitchell (1992), in technical terms, whereas nondigital (analog) photography is continuous, digital ones are discrete (recorded in bits). Michael Lynch argued that opticism and digitality are not "incommensurable or discontin- uous 'discursive formations' but... what Garfinkel has called 'asymmetric alternates"' (1991, 62). He showed that discrete representational techniques have existed apart from and before the emergence of digital images. He further showed that even though digital images are different, "The retinal keyboard [in the case of digital images] plays the spatial tunes of a classical opticism" (1991,63). Sarah Kember (1998) argued that anxieties toward a loss of photographic realism with the emergence of digital photography can be compared to similar anxieties about the place of painting when photography emerged in the nineteenth century. She instead attempted to shift the debate to "social and psychological investments" that the new technologies of visualiza- tion embody, and found continuity with earlier visual regimes in this regard. 2. This article is based on an analysis of MR images and diagrammatic representations of the human anatomy that are a part of body atlases, and direct observations and interviews of radi- ologists and technologists in the radiological laboratories. Observations of MRI radiological analyses were done at Provena Medical Center, Urbana, Illinois; and Sanjay Gandhi Post Gradu- ate Institute (SGPGI), Lucknow, India. Apart from observing these two radiological labs, I have observed MRI radiological practices at several other labs as a part of my study of the develop- ment and use of MRI in the United States and India that was conducted between September 2000 and July 2002.</page><page sequence="21">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 311 3. Mechanical reproduction of the observed object has been the moral and practical goal of nondigital visual regime. It was sought to be achieved through, as Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison showed, "self-surveillance, a form of self-control at once moral and natural-philosophical" aimed at "hemming in their [scientific authors] own temptation to impose systems, aesthetic norms, hypotheses, language, even anthropomorphic elements on pictorial representation" ( 1992, 103). It is not that mechanical reproduction of images through, for example, camera or X- ray machines were automatically accepted as authentic representations. Doubts about the authenticity of camera or X-ray images did exist when these technologies first emerged (see Pasveer 1989; Daston and Galison 1992). Moreover, Bruno Latour (1990) rightly pointed out that if we focus on how the "representation" (e.g., photograph) is made, it becomes clear that the process involves drawing together different "inscriptions." The truth value of nondigital images is, however, also established through conventions such as the negative rule of "eye-witness principle" (Gombrich 1980). According to Gombrich, the observer/artist "must not include in his image anything that eye-witness could not have seen from a particular point at a particular moment" (1980, 190). Moreover, "The standard of truth ... is also related to the medium. The image cannot give us more information than the medium can carry," thereby excluding false information (1980, 192). In contrast, human beings and machines actively and explicitly inter- vene in the production of digital visuality, and both of the above-stated rules can be, and very often are, flouted without leaving any marks or traces. 4. There has been a proliferation in the use of the term cyborg and with it the meanings that it conveys, as Sarah Kember (1998) pointed out. I use the term in the sense that Donna Haraway (1991) defined it, as an object/being that breaches the boundaries between natural/social, material/living, and other such dualisms. Cyborg (in Haraway's sense) also refigures knowledge because it embodies partial and situated perspectives instead of a singular and absolute vision. 5. Relaxation time is the time taken by hydrogen atoms to come back to their normal state after they have been magnetized by an external magnetic field. There are two relaxation times, T1 and T2, which are characteristic and different for different substances and tissues; for example, fat has different relaxation times as compared to water. In the construction of images, to save time, only a part of the signals (e.g., relaxation times) are collected and the rest of the matrix (the numerical array of data that constitute an image) is filled with zero. Zero filling does not change the resolution, but it makes the images smoother. 6. Catherine Waldby made a similar point. According to her, these images are "simulta- neously a visual text of the body and a mathematical structure of data" (Waldby 2000, 31). In James Elkins' (1999) terminology, these images are schemata, a combination of writing, pic- tures, and notations. 7. Anne Beaulieu (2002) showed the tensions inherent in brain mapping as they are being done with the images produced by PET or functional MRI. According to her, even though researchers use images/representations in studying the brain, they have an iconoclastic attitude. Such a tension could, however, also be because cognitive psychology/neurosciences are in the throes of a contentious debate. Whether biological/anatomical representations of particular states of the body, as shown by PET or functional MRI images (e.g., for aphasia, depression, cog- nition, or perception), can subsume or even define the cognitive and/or behavioral aspects associ- ated with such states is being seriously contested (see Miller 1996; Miller and Keller 2000). 8. Open MRIs, which do not have a long tube and are open on the sides, are still uncommon in the radiological laboratories. 9. The technologist is not a scientist or engineer. She or he learns which imaging protocol to use through training, through practice, and from instruction manuals. Sometimes, as I saw in the radiological labs in India, radiologists may do the work of the technologists.</page><page sequence="22">312 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 10. There is a large and growing body of historical and sociological studies of "scientific images." These studies, through a focus on the processes of the construction of images, have con- sistently shown that images are products of active interventions and not direct and passive repre- sentations of"reality out there" (see, for example, Lynch 1985, 1990; Yoxen 1987; Latour 1990). Science studies scholars have used concepts such as "shifting" (Latour 1999) or "working upon" (Knorr Cetina and Amann 1990) to depict the constructionist interventions that are a part of any representational process. 11. For example, the spinal cord is divided into three sections, and, depending on which por- tion of it is thought to be affected, one of these sections can be imaged. 12. Because the density of hydrogen atoms (protons) can vary in different parts of the body, proton density is another physical parameter from which images can be produced. Axial, coro- nal, and sagittal sections are orientations of the slice along which images are taken. In contrast to CT that can obtain direct images of only the axial section (other sections are reformatted from the information obtained by the axial section), MRI can take direct images of all the sections. This gives a special flexibility to MRI in producing images of certain parts of the body. 13. The top to bottom for MR imaging is top to bottom of the human body, that is, from head to toe. The other two sections, sagittal and coronal, are perpendicular to this in right to left and anterior to posterior directions respectively. 14. In the process of seeing in the traditional sense, even when it is produced by technologies such as X-ray, the observer can be located in the assemblage of seeing at least by reconstructing the path of light (or any other electromagnetic wave that is used for visualization) as it is transmit- ted and then reflected/absorbed. In contrast, technologies such as MRI are, as Jonathan Crary said, "relocating the vision to a plane severed from a human observer... visual images no longer have any reference to the position of the observer in a 'real,' optically perceived world" (1990, 1,2). There are several implications of such a shift in MRI visualization. For example, the color of the tissues cannot be identified. Moreover, the resolution of MR images is not dependent on the wavelength of light or other electromagnetic waves as it is for photography or X-ray imaging. 15. Body atlases have carefully labeled MR images (if it is an MRI atlas) of different parts of the body. There is also an illustrated diagrammatic representation of that particular body part available to the technologist and the radiologist to work as a comparison. 16. Paramagnetic substances such as gadolinium salts can be used as contrast agents for MR imaging. The development of contrast agents requires another level of shifting and translations. For example, gadolinium salts can be toxic, so they have to be converted to chelates before they are used for imaging. There is a whole area of research on the development of proper contrast agents for MRI. 17. Byron Good showed how the medical curriculum at Harvard begins with a course on human anatomy with the aim of making "an entry into the human body" (1994, 72). He further showed how the first two years of medical education involve training medical students to develop a new "vision" so that gross structures of the body, which are not apparent or recognizable to an untrained eye, become obvious. Apart from this training, radiologists also need to have special training to understand anatomy as it is depicted in MR images. 18. For example, until MRI emerged as a diagnostic technology, the reason for the deaths of a series of infants from brain damage and intracranial bleeding that left no marks on the surface could only be speculated. MR images proved that this was in fact true. This particular condition is called "whiplash shaken baby syndrome" (Kevles 1997). 19. For example, short tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging technique relies on the choice of an inversion time (of the radio frequency pulse, which is used to excite the hydrogen atoms whose relaxation times, density, and so on provide the basis for MR images), such that at the</page><page sequence="23">Prasad / Visibilizing and Disciplining through MRI 313 moment of excitation of hydrogen atoms, the longitudinal magnetization of lipids is zero (Vlaardingerbroek and Boer 1999). Basically, what this imaging technique does is not record the signals from the fat present in the body part that is under focus, which gives images of the body part without the fat that is present in it. 20. For example, CT uses a single parameter, electron density or differential absorption of X-rays by the tissues and the bones, to produce images of internal parts of the body 21. Certain properties of atoms other than hydrogen, for example carbon, can also be used to produce MR images. Earlier, the problem used to be in measuring the parameters of other atoms because the signals were too weak to measure. Magnetization transfer technique allows for the production of images by measuring the effect of magnetization on, for example, carbon by trans- ferring it to other atoms such as hydrogen, from which it is more easily measurable. 22. Comparisons between images from different machines can also be made. For example, the second jury in Rodney King's case, which sparked riots in Los Angeles in 1991 after the acquittal of the policemen charged with brutality, saw MRI and CT images of King's skull and brain and decided to award him $3.8 million in compensatory damages. "The MRI showed the jury where cerebral spinal fluid had leaked through multiple skull fractures (seen on accompany- ing CT images) into King's right maxillary sinus" (Kevles 1997, 175). CT images can function complementarily with MRI images, because CT gives very good images of the bones whereas MRI gives very sensitive images of the soft tissue. In general, however, they are not used together because of the cost of getting both of them done. 23. There are several studies of sociocultural and technical implications of the VHP. See for example Catherine Waldby (1997, 2000) and Lisa Cartwright (1998). 24. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/gettingdata.html (accessed December 11,2003). 25. In medical practice, the anatomico-pathological perception is largely visual even though it is multisensorial because eventually the endeavor is to map the signs evident through symp- toms of the diseases on the organs inside the body, which is made visible by looking inside corpses (Foucault 1994). One consequence of the emphasis on visualization in biomedical prac- tice is that the biological reality/pathology, which in practice is detected through a multisensorial gaze, in the end is largely identified through visual evidences. 26. According to Foucault (1970), the end of the eighteenth century marked the birth of a new era in which natural classification gave way to analyses of comparative anatomy. The princi- ples of "doctrine of signatures," which directly related a thing and a sign to their meaning through supernatural connection, no longer exists in this new era. 27. According to Nelson Goodman (1984), notations have five characteristics: syntactic disjunction, syntactic finite differentiation, semantic unambiguousness, disjoint compliance classes, and semantic finite differentiation. Elkins (1999) argued that there are neither pure nota- tions (which satisfy all five of Goodman's criteria) nor pure writing or pictures. There is always some overlap. 28. See Michael Lynch (1985, 1990) for an analysis of how such schematizing of images is done in scientific texts. 29. In spite of persistent efforts to convert pictures of the human anatomy into notations, their picture characteristic is not easily tamed either. The picture characteristic of the image, which is contiguity of its parts, is evident very often in the written description of body parts that accompany MR images. For example, Patel and Friedman described the location of parieto- occipital sulcus (a part of the brain) as "Location: Medial surface. The upper end cuts the superomedial border about 5 cm in front of the occipital pole" (Patel and Friedman 1997, 14). 30. Anatomists even in the nineteenth century were concerned with individual variations in the body (see Elkins 1986). Concern with anatomical differences, however, particularly with</page><page sequence="24">314 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values respect to gender, race, ethnicity, and so on as affecting proper understanding of the normal body (and thereby pathology), is of very recent origin. 31. See Beaulieu (2001) for an analysis of how the image of an "average" brain is con- structed by imposing coordinates as well as other transformations to serve as an ideal type of the brain. 32. According to Lynch (1990), diagrammatic representations of anatomy in biological texts are geometrized with the eventual aim of making them mathematically accessible to impose a natural order. Bastide argued that she believes "neither in mathematization nor in 'linguisticization"' (1990, 226). According to her, the geometrization of biological representa- tions "remains schematic: a vision that processes the great variety of the real to make discrete units of it, but which includes movement and the three dimensions of space" (1990, 228). 33. For example, the visual accessibility of the human brain made possible by functional MRI and PET scan is being looked at by some neuroscientists as marking the advent of a new ontology in which the brain is no longer seen as separate from the mind as it was in Cartesian metaphysics (Kosslyn 1994). Images produced by these technologies are also being used to define and distinguish social selves, for example, to distinguish schizophrenic or depressed from the normal. Joseph Dumit calls such usages "objective self fashioning" (1997). References Balsamo, A. 1996. Technologies of the gendered body. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. Bastide, F. 1990.
