<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Library of Robinson Crusoe 61 ALBERTO MANGUEL Iron-jointed, supple-sinew 'd ', they shall dive, and they shall run, Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun; Whistle back the parroťs call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks, Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books. -Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Locksley Hall one of the early days of October 1659, after being cast ashore on the coast of what he called "the Island of Despair," Robinson Crusoe returned to the wreck of his ship and managed to bring ashore a number of tools and various kinds of food, as well as "several things of less value," such as pens, ink, paper, and books. Of these books, a few were in Portuguese, a couple were "Popish prayer-books," and three were Bibles. Crusoe's "dreadful deliverance" had left him terrified of death through starvation; the tools and the food met his material needs. "Erst kommt das Fressen, dann kommt die Moral" ("First comes the fodder, then the morals"), Brecht was later to remark. So, his body looked after, Crusoe set out to nourish his mind from the ship's meager library. Robinson Crusoe was the founder - the reluctant founder - of a new soci- ety. And Daniel Defoe, his author, thought it necessary that at the begin- ning of a new society there should be books. We, the readers (compulsive creatures that we are), consider it obvious that, searching for bare necessities, Crusoe would rescue the ship's books, whether in Portuguese or in any other language; we are also tempted to guess what the "several Portuguese books" might have been. No doubt a copy of Camões' Lusiads, a fitting book in a ship's library; perhaps the writings of the illustrious António Vieira, including the wonderful "Ser- ^э Alberto Manguei is the author of A History of Reading and, most recently, Reading Pictures.</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR mon of Saint Anthony to the Fishes," in which Crusoe might have read a defense of the brothers of Friday; most certainly the Peregrination of Fernão Mendes Pinto, which tells of strange voyages through the still-mysterious Orient and which Crusoe's author, the omnivorous Defoe, knew well. We can't, however, tell precisely what those books were, because in spite of keeping a diary that dutifully recorded changes of weather and mood, Crusoe never did more than mention the books he brought onto his island. Perhaps, if his British author believed that English was the only language a gentleman required, Crusoe was unable to read Portuguese. But imagine our despair, had we found ourselves in his goatskin shoes, having at our disposal volumes of literature in a script that we couldn't decode; imagine flicking through the tongue-tied pages, willing the sense to come to us through the twenty-odd letters we know so well, yet set out in a meaningless arrangement that lent the page the quality of a nightmare. Poor us! Poor Robinson Crusoe! But of this calvary, which would be foremost in the mind of every one of us, his hypocritical readers, he tells nothing. (In fact, very soon Crusoe seems to have forgotten his books entirely; when he leaves the island on June 11, 1687, and makes a detailed list of his possessions, he doesn't breathe a word about those enigmatic volumes.) He does tell, however, of his uses of the Bible. The Bible is at the core of this new human society: it colors each of Crusoe's actions, it dictates the meaning of his sufferings, it is the instrument through which he will try, Prospero-like, to make a useful servant out of Friday. Crusoe writes: "I explained to [Friday] , as well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the nature of angels but the seed of Abraham, and how for that reason the fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that he came only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel, and the like." And Crusoe adds, with disarming frankness: "I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction." The book is an instrument of instruction; the book is also an instru- ment of divination. Some time later, sunk in despair, Crusoe tries, like Job, to understand his condition. "Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus used?" He opens the Bible and finds this sentence: "I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Immediately he realizes that these words are meant for him. On that faraway coast, starting over again with a few odds and ends from society's ruins - seeds, guns, and the Word of God - Crusoe constructs a new world at whose center the Holy Bible shines its fierce and ancient light. can live in a society founded on the book and yet not read, or one can live in a society where the book is merely a prop, and be, in the deepest, truest sense, a reader. As a society, the Greeks, for instance, cared little for books and yet, individually, they were great readers. Aristotle, whose books (as we know them) are probably lecture notes 62</page><page sequence="3">The Library of Robinson Crusoe taken down by his students, read widely, and his own library is the first in ancient Greece about which there is certain information. Socrates, who despised books and never deigned to leave a single written word, chose to read the speech of the orator Lycias rather than hear it recited by the enthusiastic Phaedrus. But I believe that Crusoe would have chosen to be told the text. Crusoe, the representative of a book-centered Judeo-Christian society, was not a reader as we, in our so-called literate society, are readers. Crusoe (even though he "read daily the Word of God," as he tells us himself) was not even a keen reader of the Bible, the book that lay at the center of his life, his Book of Power (to borrow Luther's phrase). Crusoe would con- sult it daily, as he would have consulted the Internet had it existed, and would have allowed it to guide him. But he did not make the Word his, as Saint Augustine insisted we must do, incarnating the written text. He merely accepted society's word for it. Had Crusoe been shipwrecked at the end of our millennium, it is easy to imagine him rescuing from the ship not the Book of Power but a PowerBook, which is not an instrument for reading but merely a tool for writing and research. What distinguishes Crusoe from Defoe, his author and assiduous reader, both inhabitants of the society of the book? What distinguishes a reader of books from someone for whom a book is merely powerful or prestigious? Or rather: What distinguishes the importance of words res- cued through the act of reading from the prison of the page from the Word unread but revered in the prison of the page? There is an un- bridgeable difference between the book that tradition has declared a classic and the book (the same book) that we have made ours through instinct, emotion, and understanding: suffered through it, rejoiced in it, translated it into our experience, and (notwithstanding the layers of read- ings it accreted before it came into our hands) essentially become its first discoverers. This is an experience as astonishing and unexpected as find- ing Friday's footprint on the sand. "The songs of Homer," declared Goethe, "have the power to deliver us, if only for brief moments, from the fearsome load with which tradition has weighed us down over many thousands of years." To be the first to enter Circe's cave or hear Ulysses call himself Nobody is every reader's secret wish, granted over and over, generation after generation, to all who open the Odyssey. This modest ^ws primae noctis, or "first night rights," ensures for the books we call classics their only useful immortality. There are two ways of reading the much-quoted verse of Ecclesiastes: "Of making many books there is no end." We can read it as a mirroring of the words that follow - "and much study is a weariness of the flesh" - and we can shrug at the impossible task of reaching the end of our library; or we can read the first clause as a jubilation, a prayer of thanks for the bounty of God, so that the connecting "and" reads as a separating "but." 63</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Crusoe chooses the first reading; Aristotle (and Saint Jerome and Erasmus and Leon Hebreo and Sor Juana and Dr. Johnson and Northrop Frye) choose the second. Beginning in some lost afternoon in Mesopo- tamia, every reader has found ways of picking his or her way through the library of infinitely "many books," in spite of the "weariness of the flesh." Every reader has found charms by which to secure possession of a page that, by magic, becomes as if never read before, fresh and immaculate, all previous readings now incorporated into the very atoms of the text. The history of reading is, in some sense, the story of those charms. At the other extreme from Crusoe - the man who venerates the Book but doesn't read the books, who accepts the verdict of tradition but is not moved to peer between a book's closed covers - sits the reader for whom every book is always open to criticism. Discipline, not pleasure, dictates this reader's craft. He finds occupations in the seats of academia and the office of the censor. For this hypersensitive soul, no text can be taken at face value. In fact, no text can be taken at all, unless expurgated and purified, sometimes to the point of destruction. One evening in 1939, in Buenos Aires, the writers Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares, and Silvina Ocampo decided to immortalize this punctilious reader. They composed, in his honor, the following list (ac- cording to Bioy Casares, very much tongue-in-cheek) of the "Things Lit- erature Must Avoid": Psychological curiosities and paradoxes: murders through kindness, suicides through contentment. Surprising interpretations of certain books and characters: The misogyny of Don Juan, etc. Twin protagonists too obviously dissimilar: Don Quixote and San- cho, Sherlock Holmes and Watson. Novels with identical twin characters, like Bouvard and Pécuchet If the author invents a trait for one, he is forced to invent a trait for the other. Characters depicted through their peculiarities, as in Dickens. Anything new or astonishing. Civilized readers are not amused by the discourtesy of a surprise. Idle games with time and space: Faulkner, Borges, et al. The discovery in a novel that the real hero is the prairie, the jungle, the sea, the rain, the stock market. Poems, situations, characters with which the reader might - God forbid! - identify. Phrases that might become proverbs or quotations. Characters likely to become myths. Chaotic enumeration. A rich vocabulary. Synonyms. Le mot juste. Any attempt at precision. Vivid descriptions, worlds full of rich physical details. Background, ambiance, atmosphere. Tropical heat, drunkenness, 64</page><page sequence="5">The Library of Robinson Crusoe the voice on the radio, phrases repeated like a refrain. Meteorological beginnings and endings. Pathetic fallacies. "Le vent se lève! Il faut tenter de vivre!" Any metaphors. Particularly visual metaphors. Even more particularly, metaphors drawn from agriculture, seamanship, banking (as in Proust). Anthropomorphism. Books that parallel other books. Ulysses and the Odyssey. Books that pretend to be menus, photo albums, itineraries, concerts. Anything that might inspire illustrations. Anything that might inspire films. The extraneous: domestic scenes in detective novels. Dramatic scenes in philosophical dialogues. The expected. Pathos and erotic scenes in love stories. Puzzles and crimes in detective stories. Ghosts in supernatural stories. Vanity, modesty, pederasty, no pederasty, suicide. At the end of this reader's demands lies, of course, the absence of any literature. Happily, most readers fall between these two drastic extremities. Most of us neither shun books in veneration of literature, nor shun literature in veneration of books. Our craft is more modest. We pick our way down endless shelves of books, choosing this or that for no clear discernible reason: because of a cover, a title; because of something someone said or didn't say; because of a hunch, a whim, a mistake; because we think we may find in this book a particular tale or character or detail; because we believe it was written for us; because we believe it was written for everyone except us and we want to find out why we have been excluded; because we want to learn, or laugh, or forget. have been talking about reading as if the different aspects of this craft were invariable. Perhaps, up to a point, they are. In Mesopotamia as in Greece, in Buenos Aires as in Toronto, readers and nonreaders have existed side by side, and the nonreaders have always constituted the vast majority. Whether in the exclusive scriptoria of Sumer or medieval Europe, whether in eighteenth-century London or twentieth-century Paris, the number of those for whom reading books is of the essence is very small. What varies, I think, is not the proportions, in very general terms, between these two groups of humanity, but the way in which different societies regard the book and the art of reading. And here the distinction comes into play again between the book that is enthroned and the book that is read. If a visitor from the past arrived today in our civilized cities, he would certainly be surprised by the reading habits of his future brethren. What would this ancient Gulliver see? He would see vast commercial temples in which books were sold by the thousand, immense edifices with such names 65</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR as Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble, in which the published word would be divided and arranged in arbitrary categories for the guided consumption of the faithful. Here the gastronomic vocabulary developed to describe the art of reading ever since the angel ordered Ezekiel to eat the heavenly book has acquired physical reality, and readers sip coffee and chew on cake as they devour trashy novels and scholarly tomes, gossip magazines and learned journals that lament the death of the book. He would see libraries, with readers still wandering among the stacks or among the half- mutated virtual collections into which some of the books have been con- verted. Outside, too, the visitor would find a host of readers: readers on park benches, readers in the subway, readers on buses and trams and trains, readers waiting at airports, readers sitting in restaurants with books open before them. Inside apartments and houses (our visitor has piercing vi- sion) he would see readers in bed and readers on the toilet, readers in armchairs by crackling fires and readers sprawled on the floor, legs in the air. He may be excused if he supposes that ours is a literate society. On the contrary! We are not a literate society. Our society accepts the book as a given, albeit an antiquated staple. But the act of reading, once considered useful and prestigious, if not dangerous and subversive, is now condescendingly accepted as a pastime that lacks efficiency and contributes little to the common good. As our visitor would eventually realize, reading here is nothing but an ancillary act, and the great reposi- tory of our memory and experience, the universal library, is considered to be less a living entity than a cumbersome storage room - a superfluous storage room, because it contains nothing but the past. During the student revolts that shook the world in the late 1960s, one of the slogans addressed to the lecturers at the University of Heidelberg was "Hier wird nicht zitiert!": "No quoting here!" The students were de- manding original thought; they were forgetting that to quote is to con- tinue a conversation from the past in order to contextualize the present. To quote is to make use of the Library of Babel; to quote is to reflect on what has been said before. Unless we do that, we speak in a vacuum where no human voice can make a sound. "To write history is to cite it," declared Walter Benjamin. To write the past, to converse with history, was, as we know, the humanist ideal, the ideal that Nicholas of Cusa first put forward in 1440. In his De docta ignorantia (On learned ignorance), he suggested that the earth might not be the center of the universe and that outer space might be infinite rather than bounded by divine decree; he also proposed the creation of a semi-utopian society that, like the univer- sal library, would contain all mankind, a society in which politics and religion would no longer be disruptive forces. It is interesting to note that, for the humanists, there is a correlation between the suspicion of unbounded space that belongs to no one and the knowledge of a wealthy past that belongs to all. 66</page><page sequence="7">The Library of Robinson Crusoe is, of course, the precise opposite of the World Wide Web. The Web defines itself as a space that belongs to all and precludes a sense of the past. There are no nationalities on the Web (except, of course, for the fact that its lingua franca is English) and no censorship (except, again, that governments are finding ways to ban access to certain sites, a censorship by omission). The past (the temporal tradition that leads to our electronic present) is, for the Web user, inhabited by no one. Elec- tronic space is (apparently) frontierless. Sites - that is to say, specific, self- defined locations - are set up on it but neither limit nor possess it, like water on water. It is quasi-instantaneous; it occupies no time except the nightmare of a constant present. All surface and no volume, all present and no past, the Web aspires to be (advertises itself as) every user's home, where communication with every other user is possible at the speed of thought. That is its main characteristic: speed. The Venerable Bede, la- menting the brevity of our life on earth, compared it to the passage of a bird through a well-lit hall, entering from the darkness at one end and exiting through the darkness at the other. Our society would interpret Bede 's lament as an act of boasting. The life of a disk is about seven years; a CD-ROM lasts about ten. Virtual collections, where they exist, must be backed up several times. A few years ago, in the Archeological Museum of Naples, I saw, held be- tween two plates of glass, the ashes of a papyrus rescued from the ruins of Pompeii. It was two thousand years old; it had been burnt by the fire of Vesuvius, buried under a flow of lava - and you could still read the letters written on it as clearly as a page of today's newsprint. The new media, on the other hand, are of the moment, straddling, thanks to their audio and writing functions, the electronic traditions and the traditions of the book. Eventually (one can only hope) they will free themselves from both, developing their own, technology-specific vocabulary. To read the whole of Crime and Punishment or Gone with the Wind on a computer screen or downloaded on a Rocket eBook is hardly a relaxing business, since no ordinary person can sit for hours in front of an illuminated screen be- hind which scrolls a text made of flickering dots. And readers of books on CD-ROM (now reserved mostly for reference works) must be submitted to the humiliation of being led through a story as if they were children, requiring a guiding voice or pretty moving images. To demean a CD- ROM, so full of possibilities, to the mere function of an ancient codex, albeit illustrated and read aloud, is to ignore its richness - it's like using a jet plane to drive down the street to the mall. This misuse, I believe, will not last long: only until the artists take over the new medium and grant it its own vocabulary, as artists did with the invention of photography, radio, cinema, video. Only then will we realize that a CD-ROM is not a book, just as a photograph is not a painting. Until that moment, its function will hover somewhere between chatting and leafing. 67</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR One other failing: the Web is not universal. Only the richest societies possess it. For millions of human beings on this planet, the Web is as inaccessible as the universe's farthest moon. We who do possess it, however, think of it as all-reaching, and speak of it as if it will replace every other technology, including printed books. North American publishers today assume that at least 30 percent of a future book's projected sales will be electronic. Our future paperless society (defined by Bill Gates in a book, I wish to point out) may be global, but it is certainly not cosmopolitan, since it can be no one's home: no one can actually inhabit a Web site. But a paperless society can in- crease the already gargantuan profits of the multinational companies that own and maneuver in this virtual space. Not only do they control the systems that allow these sites to exist, encroaching on the written patri- mony of the world, but they are now purchasing our iconographical inheritance as well. The figures on Achilles' shield and the ever- unweaving picture on Penelope's tapestry would, if fashioned today, be subject to a corporate fee. Corbis, a company Gates founded in 1989, has acquired reproduction rights to many works in the collections of the National Gallery in London, the Barnes Foundation, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Hermitage, and the Far Eastern collection in the Royal Ontario Museum. Other companies acquiring massive iconographi- cal rights are Disney, CNN, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks, Bertelsmann, Sony, and Conrad Black's Hollinger International Inc. January 18, 1949, an American by the name of James T. Mangan filed a charter with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, and under the state attorney's authority claimed ownership to the whole of space. After giving his vast territory the name of Celestia, Mr. Mangan notified all countries on earth of his claim, warned them not to attempt any trips to the moon, and petitioned the United Nations for membership. Mr. Mangan 's ambitious enterprise has now, in a more practical sense, been taken over by the multinational corporations. Their methods have been extraordinarily effective. By offering electronic users the appearance of a world controlled from their keyboards, a world in which everything can be "accessed" and everything can be had, as in fairy tales, by a simple click of the mouse, these companies have ensured that, on the one hand, users will not protest against being used themselves (since they are supposedly "in control" of cyberspace) and that, on the other hand, users will be prevented from learning anything profound about themselves, their sur- roundings, or the rest of the world. This sleight of hand is achieved by stressing velocity over reflection and brevity over complexity, by prefer- ring snippets of news and bytes of facts to lengthy discussions and elaborate dossiers, and by diluting informed opinion with reams of inane babble, ineffectual advice, inaccurate data, and trivial information, made attrac- 68</page><page sequence="9">The Library of Robinson Crusoe tive with brand names and manipulated statistics. The fastidious Florence Nightingale once declared that "to understand God's thoughts we must study statistics, for these are the measure of His purpose." They are also the measure of the unholy purpose of these ever-encroaching corporations. But the Web is not to blame for our lack of interest in exploring the past or for our superficial concern with the present. Its virtue, as I've said, is in the brevity and multiplicity of its information; it cannot also provide us with concentration and depth. The electronic media assist us in a myriad of practical ways, but not in all. A computer will not be the container of our cosmopolitan past, like a book, because it is not a book and will never be a book, in spite of the endless gadgets and guises invented to force it into that role. Nor will it lend us bed and board in our passage through this world, because it isn't a resting place; it is neither a foreign country nor a home, it is neither Circe's cave nor Ithaca. We alone, and not our technologies, are responsible for our losses, and we alone are to blame when we deliberately choose oblivion over recollection. We are, however, adroit at making excuses and dreaming up reasons for our inabilities. The Abenaki Indians of North America, for instance, believe that a special group of deities, the Oonagamessok, presided over the making of petroglyphs, and they explain the gradual disappearance of these rock engravings by saying that the gods were angered by the lack of attention accorded to them since the arrival of the whites. The petroglyphs of our common past are fading not because of the arrival of a new technology but because we are no longer moved to read them. We are losing our common vocabulary, built over thousands and thousands of years to voice and help and delight and instruct us, for the sake of what we take to be the new technology's exclusive virtues. Virtues they may be, but they are not exclusive. The world, as Crusoe discovered, is large enough always to accommodate one more marvel. In this sense, being a cosmopolitan today may mean being eclectic, refusing exclusion. Our tendency to build walls is useful only in providing a starting point for self-definition. Those walls contain the bed in which we are born, in which we dream, we breed, and we die; but outside them lies Siddhartha's realization that all human beings grow old, all are prone to nightmare and disease, and all must ultimately come to the same mortal end. Our existence flows, like an impossible river, in two directions: from the endless mass of names, places, creatures, stars, books, rituals, memo- ries, illuminations, and stones we call the world, to the face that stares at us every morning from the mirror; and from that face, from that body that surrounds a center we cannot see, from that which names us when we say /, to everything that is Other, outside, beyond. A sense of who we are individually, coupled with a sense of collective citizenship in the in- conceivable universe, lends something like meaning to our lives - a meaning put into words by the books in our libraries. 69</page><page sequence="10">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR I am convinced that reading will survive as long as we persist in lend- ing words to the world that surrounds us. So much has been named, so much will continue to be named, that in spite of our foolishness we will not give up this small miracle that allows us the ghost of an understand- ing. Books may not change our suffering, books may not protect us from evil, books may not tell us what is good or what is beautiful, books will certainly not shield us from the common fate of the grave. But books grant us the possibility of these things, the possibility of change, the possibility of illumination. It may be that there is no book, however well written, that can remove an ounce of pain from the tragedies of Ireland or the Middle East, but it may also be that there is no book, however foully written, that does not allow an epiphany for its destined reader. On page 162, Robinson Crusoe writes this: "It may not be amiss for all people who shall meet my story to make this just observation from it, viz., how frequently in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into it, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very same means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again." This, of course, is not Crusoe speaking, but Defoe, the reader of many books. Histories, chronologies, almanacs offer us the illusion of progress, even though, over and over again, we are given proof that there is no such thing. There is transformation and there is passage, but whether for better or for worse depends on the context and the observer. As readers, we have gone from learning a precious craft whose secret was held by a jealous few, to taking for granted a skill that has become subordinate to principles of mindlessness or efficiency, and for which governments care almost nothing. We have gone from one to the other many times, and will no doubt do so again. We can't be spared from this erratic course, which seems to be an intrinsic part of our human nature, but we can at least sway with the knowledge of our swaying and with the conviction that, at one point or another, our craft will once again be recognized as of the essence. The library of Robinson Crusoe was (or rather, should have been) not merely an idol or a prop but his new society's essential tool. The apostle Paul (the only apostle not to have known Jesus face-to- face) would boldly say to those he encountered, men and women seeking the Scriptures, "Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?" He knew that because he had read the Word, the Word was now lodged inside him, even if he had not met the Author; that he had become the Book, the Word made flesh through that little bit of the divine which the craft of reading allows to all those who seek to learn it. This is the wisdom of the Essene sect, the devout people who gave us, so many centuries ago, the Dead Sea Scrolls: We know that the body is corruptible and the stuff of which it is made, impermanent. But we also know that the soul (and I, their future reader, will interject, "the book") is immortal and imperishable. 70</page></plain_text>
