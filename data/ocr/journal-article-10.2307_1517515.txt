<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORT NOTES THE CASE OF THE BLASPHEMER (Leviticus XXIV 10 ff.) Lev. xxiv 10 ff. describes an incident alleged to have occurred in the Israelite camp during the time of Moses' leadership, in which two men became involved in a brawl. The one was the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father, while the other was a pure Israelite. In the course of the brawl the man of mixed parentage uttered words which offended the religious scruples of the bystanders and they brought him to Moses for trial. Moses did not know how to deal with this case and he referred it to divine judgment. The verdict given by the divine oracle was that the man had committed a heinous crime and the penalty to be exacted was execution by public stoning. The crime of the accused, as stated in the above Hebrew text (v. 11), was that pb1 1 tlW n . r ..... :. The RSVfollows the hitherto accepted understanding of this line by translating: 'he blasphemed the Name and he cursed'. The NEB 1) rendering, however, is 'he uttered the Holy 2) Name in blasphemy'. A study of both verbs in this verse (np'i and pr'n) shows that the conventional translation re- presented by the RSV in misleading, for it implies that the first verb involves the notion of deliberate impiety, while the rendering of the second verb as 'he cursed' may be admitted only if it is understood in the sense of reviling. On the other hand, the NEB translation gives the true sense of the line, as will be demonstrated in this brief study. The verb pr1, when taken in isolation, could be the Kal Imperfect of either the Double 'Ayin root =:p 'cursed', in the sense of invoking evil upon 3) or of the Pe Nun Verb jp3 'named, mentioned by name'. That it is the latter root which appears in our text is made amply clear by its use in the statement of the new law in verse 16 which was promulgated by divine decree as a result of this incident-ntr :pi nlrz nln nm-'Whoever utters the Name of the Lord shall be put to 1) The New English Bible: Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, 1970. 2) The NEB rendering of tH1 by 'the Holy Name' when it refers to YHWH seems to be warranted; it conveys the sense of the Hebrew term in English thinking by introducing the adjective 'Holy' and writing both words with capital letters. 3) It is well known that certain Hebrew words for situations, activities, ideas and objects may, in relevant context, denote their application and effect. t7W 'law' may also mean the application of the law, namely, the 'verdict'. Similarly the Hebrew verb for 'cursing' may also imply its effect, that is, 'the bringing on of a calamity'. The same may be said about the verb t'' 'blessed'. 118</page><page sequence="2">SHORT NOTES death' (NEB correctly). The verbal forms np'l in verse 11 and pn1 in verse 16 carry no implications beyond the sense of uttering the Name of God 1). The second verb in verse 11 ('1rp') refers to the behavioural circumstances in which the Name was uttered by the accused. We turn, therefore, to a summary account of this latter root in its various verbal Forms. One must mention, of course, that the Piel Form ?p does often mean 'cursed' in the sense of invoking calamity upon someone as evidenced, for example, by its occurrence in 2 Kg. ii 24. In this passage the narrator relates an incident in which the prophet Elisha was jeered at by some young boys, who called after him 'baldhead'. The prophet cursed them in the Name of the Lord--n,' mi;a ntapl-- so that two she-bears came out of the wood and mauled 42 of them. In certain contexts, however, this derived Piel Form conveys the sense of reviling, as we shall now demonstrate. The Stative verb '7p ('p) has the primary meaning 'was light' and so 'was of small account' as in Job xl 4 ' n]:t nn '.5 1i7 p 'Behold, I am of small account, what shall I answer thee'? 2) The sense of this verb in Kal is quite clear. The Niphal of this root has the derived meaning of being or becoming an object of small account, that is, an object of contempt. In Gen. xvi 4 (and also v. 5) the writer speaks of the de- terioration in Sarah's standing in the estimation of her handmaid Hagar, when the latter had become pregnant with Abraham's child as ;rY:a n;n:a 1pp.. The translations 'she (Hagar) looked upon her mistress with contempt' (RSV) and 'she (Hagar) despised her mistress' (NEB) do not represent the precise sense of this expression. The 1) Though the Talmudic Rabbis engaged in discussion as to which of the two roots (=j? or 1731) underlies the word 21V1 (Sanhedrin 56a) the Mishna which gave rise to the discussion (Sanhedrin VII. 5) states explicitly ""'rln lrI y'1zn 1It?; ' t'5t 'the blasphemer is not culpable unless he had expressly pronounced the Name' (i.e. the Tetragrammaton). The Rabbis certainly knew the correct meaning of 219l, but they were prone to engage in this kind of spurious discussion in order to bring out the sense of the word more pointedly or Midrashically extend its range. Targum Onkelos, reflecting the authoritative Rabbinic view, rightly represents his word by t"s'1 'he clearly pronounced', as well as trans- lating p17l of v. 16 '11'"71. This root is used in the Rabbinic term for the ex- pressed Divine Name t113MB1 ltW. We note that RS V takes j731 to mean 'he who blasphemes'. It may be that, because of the extreme penalty exacted for a breach of this prohibition, commentators saw in this word the implication of blasphemy. We shall later suggest that the objection was to the indiscriminate use of the Name of God. 2) The NEB reverses the order of the verse and translates: 'What reply can I give thee, I who carry no weight'? 119</page><page sequence="3">SHORT NOTES writer was referring, not to Hagar's assumed arrogance towards her mistress but, to Sarah's having lost status, because of the new standing which Hagar had acquired through her pregnancy. At the risk of ap- pearing pedantic I suggest that a more exact translation would be 'her mistress became contemptible in her (Hagar's) estimation'. It was, in fact, this loss of face which Sarah felt which impelled her com- plain to Abraham with the words ;rlp a bjl 'I have become contempt- ible in her estimation'. To express the notion of actively displaying contempt the Piel Form of this root would have to be employed in its so-called Factitive 1) effect. An example of this derived meaning may be seen in 1 Sam. iii 13. In this passage (beginning with v 11) God reveals to the youthful Samuel the retribution which was to fall upon the aged Eli, because of his indulgence and negligence in not reprimanding his sons for their excesses, though he knew full well that they were guilty of an,IbR Qtr,pt 2), that is, of 'blaspheming God'. A parallel pattern of derived meanings may be seen in the root :7az (with the opposite meaning of '7j)-'was heavy, was in ho- nour' 3). Returning, then, to our passage in Leviticus dealing with the case of the blasphemer, clearly his crime was that he uttered the name of God with impious and contemptuous words. The pronouncement of the divine verdict of execution by public stoning for this offence (xxiv 14) is followed by a restatement of the prohibition Xbpn Nr ;*n, 1) A curious feature of Hebrew grammar, for which the present writer has not found any rational explanation, is that the Derived Piel Form of some Stative verbs produces, what some grammarians call, a Factitive (almost a Causative) effect. Of the verb KR; 'was full with' the Piel R. has the derived meaning 'filled with'. Of the verb nut 'was glad', the Piel Form nMtO means 'gladdened'. 2) This restored reading is supported by the LXX xocxoXoyouvreq 0e6v. The Massoretic reading H1;7 1:1 pn? is one of the 18 Tikkine' Soperim - deliberate Rabbinic alterations in certain texts in order to avoid expressions about God which would be impious or indelicate. Kimhi refers to this device in his note on this Massoretic reading and this example is quoted in Midrash Tanhuma, Belallah, 16 which states that these alterations were instituted by the Men of the Great Assembly. With regard to the meaning of the Participle DIt7j7 Rashi's comment is pTfl1 nbi' ]110 '(it has) the meaning of light esteem and contempt'. Similarly Kimhi notes that 71tZT1 ]"3 t1H IRl x 15n 17I 'this cursing has the sense of (showing) contempt'. 3) Examples of this pattern are: - a) Job xiv 21 '12 (Kal) '1 :T 'his sons have honour (able status)', rather than the NEB 'his sons rise to honour', since the Sta- tive verb describes a state or condition, b) Deut. xxviii 58 (Niphal) nD;H 17D f13 lS1 'I7R 'in the presence of all the people I will be treated with honour' (NEB) and c) Ex. xx 7 (and Deut. v 16) J?R IK 11 ":IK 1n 'T3 (Piel) '(Show) honour (towards) your father and your mother'. 120</page><page sequence="4">SHORT NOTES 'you shall not revile (God)' 1) (Ex. xxii 27) which is now formulated in these words tnrin tnl *nv 'ip 3O B^ rvx 'Anyone who reviles his God shall bear (the consequences of) his sin' 2) (Lev. xxiv 15). How, then, are we to understand the divine directive in v. 16 which states :pi nar nlit n;1 tt 'Whoever utters the Name of the Lord shall be put to death' ? This looks like a later development, extending the prohibition to the uttering of God's name indiscriminately and without compelling reason. This appears to be the sense of the negative commandment in the Decalogue (Ex. xx 7 and Deut. v 1 1) klt W ' ;n m tm nw PK tn xK. The tra- ditional English rendering 'You shall not take the Name of the Lord, your God, in vain', adopted by the RS V, is too vague to be meaningful and lends itself to a variety of possible interpretations. D. M. G. STAL- KER 3) sums up the interpretation of this commandment held by many scholars as follows: 'The commandment does not prohibit the taking of oaths. It rules out any misuse of God's name as in perjury, making vows and not keeping them, etc., and any use of it in spells and magic'. This interpretation appears to underlie the NEB translation 'You shall not make wrong use of the Name of the Lord, your God'. 'Wrong use' is the meaning taken to be implied by tlt1v. It seems to me however, that ml7v means 'for no reason'. The traditional Jewish understanding of this commandment is that it refers to the taking of oaths 4), but the root xti often refers to speech as, for example, in 1) Targum Onkelos, representing the official Rabbinic interpretation, renders the Hebrew Z;7RK by the Aramaic R",I 'judge' in the Exodus text. This inter- pretation may have been prompted by analogy with the second half of this verse which states 'fn KR '1? 1 R MVfl 'nor curse a chief of your people'. The parallel to 'chief' should be a human being and 'judge' seemed the most likely. 2) This is another example of the phenomenon mentioned in Note 3. .Wn means 'a sin(ful act)' and, in this context, the consequences of a sinful act, namely, punishment. Though what this punishment is to be is not explicitly stated in this verse, it would follow from the verdict pronounced against the blasphemer. 3) D. M. G. STALKER: Exodus, Peake's Commentary on the Bible (ed. M. BLACK &amp; H. H. ROWLEY) Nelson, Edinburgh, 1962: p. 228. 4) Targum Onkelos presents the rendering Mf.?} ';I"RK "x' Kt?t 2 W"Yn R which could be taken to mean either 'You shall not utter the name of the Lord, your God for no reason' or 'You shall not take an oath in the name of .......', since the Aramaic root " can mean either 'spoke' or 'took an oath'. The context here does not help us determine which meaning is indicated, but Targum J makes it clear that the official Rabbinic interpretation of this Decalogue prohibition is against the taking of oaths for no purpose, for it reads 1D3 ] fll3 n 7 n?W1 ? } 5Y p11t n ""I7 WIV't. 'No one of you shall take an oath in the name of the Memra of the Lord, your God, for no purpose'. We would suppose that, since Onkelos usually presents the official Rabbinic interpretation, his translation would have to be understood in the same way. On this basis the Targum on Ps. cxxxix 20b 'plt xv u5 R- is t is 1:: 7 :1t p1 y : lP'Y:nt 'your enemies swear for no 121</page><page sequence="5">SHORT NOTES Ex. xxiii 1 Kt Sti morn mK the sense of which is correctly given in NEB as 'You shall not spread false rumours' but this involves speech. It seems to me that the Decalogue commandment forbids the uttering of God's name without due reason or legitimate purpose 1), quite apart from using it for ulterior purposes. In this connection it may be relevant to mention the well-known biblical form of oath-taking ;rr -n 'as YHWH lives' which is found in the composite form nirn in the Lachish Letters (no. 3) 2). The use of the oath-taking formula mlrn in this Lachish despatch would have been regarded as justified, for the writer was protesting most vigorously his innocence of the charge made against him-whatever that may have been-and he took a solemn oath, by invoking God's name, that he was blameless. In fact, because of its awe-inspring effect upon all concerned, the use of God's name in a situation of solemn oath-taking would have been considered, not only as legitimate but as necessary. The commandment in the Decalogue expresses objection to the uttering of God's name, where there is no justification for so doing. That the term 'the Name' is a substitute for and equivalent to YHWH is clear, not only from the context of Lev. xxiv 11, but is also indicated in Deut. xxviii 58b in the strange line ctvB nriK m;K'r 1"'IR 1' mmn mtl Rx'I11 't=n 'to revere this honoured and dreaded Name, (that is) YHWH, your God'. The participle nK is used in both sections of this line to refer to the same object of reverence. The introduction of 'Name' before 'YHWH' in Is. xxx 27 mrrn nt ;1n prnnr N: 'Behold, the Name of YHWH comes from afar' appears to be motivated by the need to avoid a description of God's activity which might be construed as anthropomorphic 3). That YHWH is actually meant is confirmed by the words following this statement, namely lqK vtg '(with) his anger burning' where, strangely, the state- reason' and on Ps. xxiv 4 (Qere "w'Z3) 'lt3 t W RWV2l KMt 'l7X Rashi comments MRVtt 21 '1:t ? :Z3 l X1tt7? 'he has not sworn falsely by my name and by my being'. 1) In the Talmud Berakot 33a we find a parallel warning against unnecessary indulgence in the making of benedictions: 'In R Q1tt~ 'n1S7 1 'S WIRP 7 ?'1':1 'Anyone who utters a benediction unnecessarily transgresses (the law of) 'You shall not utter ... etc. Here the meaning of lInI is 'utter'. 2) H. TORCZYNER: LACHISH I, The lachish letters: Oxford University Press, 1938. In letter 12 the formula appears as two words. 3) The avoidance of direct reference to activity by God is characteristic of the Targumim. An illustration of this is Gen. vi 9 which states nl JlInn t";1mK;1 nK 'Noah walked with God' but both Targum Onkelos and J render this statement as nl ''M "''l XR 'm 'Noah walked in the fear of the Lord'. 122</page><page sequence="6">SHORT NOTES ment is in anthropomorphic terms. The fact that there is no consistency or pattern in the adoption of substitues for the term YHWH and that a substitution may appear alongside a direct reference to YHWH sug- gests the emergence of scruples about direct reference to the personal- ised Deity. A feature in the development processes in religious and social life, as well as in the sphere of language, is that innovations which enter the pattern of existing practices do not immediately oust those practices. They are often used alongside current custom and only later become fixed and permanent. While it would be fair to say that 'the Name' is a substitute for 'YHWH', expressions such as trN' tn 'Tp, 'the Holy One of Israel' so frequently found in Isaiah (e.g. i 4, etc.) and '7rtr nal 'the Splendour of Israel' (1 Sam. xx 29) do not seem to be substitutes for 'YHWH' for reasons of scruple but, rather, alternative expressions for 'God' in which reference is made to his special attributes and his unique relationship with Israel. Dublin J. WEINGREEN nnb" = 1p3 "And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe" (1 Sam. xii 11). The appearance of the name 1T among the well-known figures of Jerubbaal, Jephthah and Samuel in the verse cited above has been a source of difficulty from the inception of Biblical interpretation, for the book of Judges fails to make any mention whatsoever of this judge and saviour 1). According to Targum Jonathan pt;l is none other than Samson, a variant apparently based upon a midrashic tradition (B. Talmud, Rosh Hashonah 25 a): "Why is he called Bedan? Because he came 1) It would appear that the mention of the name Samuel is also problematic for (a) the speaker would then be referring to himself and not in the first person, and (b) Samuel is not one of the "saviour judges". We should not allow ourselves to be misled by the Lucianic and Peshitta rendition of Pfltt, due to the partial graphic similarity, for we should not invalidate the possibility that traditions concerning Samuel existed which were not included in the canonical work bearing his name. Such a tradition is hinted at in 1 Sam. vii 15 "And Samuel judged Israel...", an accepted formula concerning the saving judges, and also in his role during the war described in the same chapter. That he refers to himself is only an artificial difficulty, if we do not forget that the speaker is not Samuel, and the speechwriter who attached the script to Samuel failed by revealing himself through his inclusion of the name Samuel in the same list.
