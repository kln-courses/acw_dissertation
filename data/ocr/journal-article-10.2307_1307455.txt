<plain_text><page sequence="1">Commentary On Animal and Human Sociobiology Adam -Lomnicki Editor's Note: The debate over sociobiology in this country has had few reverberations in the socialist countries. This article is one of the first reflections on the subject from a scientist from the socialist world. Recent years have brought real prog- ress in our understanding of the Darwini- an theory of natural selection. Hamilton (1964) and then Maynard Smith and Price (1973) have explained how altruis- tic behavior and ritualized aggression, respectively, can be of selective advan- tage to an individual. The idea of group selection put forward by Wynne-Ed- wards (1962) was another important step. This idea was strongly criticized (Maynard Smith 1964), and, although eventually abandoned by Wynne-Ed- wards (1977), it provoked the develop- ment of the mathematical theory of group selection (Levins 1970, Matessi and Jayakar 1976). This in turn helped to clarify the evolutionary basis of the so- cial behavior of animals. The idea that the social behavior of an- imals can be explained by the Darwinian theory of natural selection was popular- ized under the name of "sociobiology" (Wilson 1975). But evolutionary ex- planations cannot be confined to the so- cial behavior of animals only. Investiga- tions by Lack (1966) on the brood size of birds are essentially based on the same concepts as those used in sociobiology. They do not explain the physiological mechanism and genetic basis which bring about some characters but only show how these characters help to main- tain and spread the genome of the ani- mals that exhibit them. It would be very useful to know the physiological and genetic background of the phenomena to which the evolution- ary explanations are applied. However, though this is not possible at the present state of our knowledge, there is no rea- son to reject evolutionary explanations. The discoveries made by Lack on the de- termination of brood size in birds are of importance, irrespective of whether or not we know the neurophysiological mechanism and the genetic background of this phenomenon. Evolutionary explanations of ecologi- cal and behavioral phenomena seem to be a very important and promising devel- opment in contemporary biology. Through the work of Lack, Hamilton, Maynard Smith, and others we can reject the obscure and ambiguous concept of selection for the characters that are of advantage for the species or for a popu- lation. We now understand the Darwini- an theory of natural selection much bet- ter and can use this theory as a higher order hypothesis, against which all other biological hypotheses can be tested. Un- til recently, ecology was removed from evolutionary theory, but now these two fields are integrated, as was predicted by Darwin himself. Sociobiology, by applying evolution- ary explanations to animal behavior, rep- resents real and important progress in both ethology and evolutionary theory. Nevertheless, the theory of biological evolution and biology in general differs from the physical sciences. Anthropo- morphic value terms, like "fitness," "progress," and "better" or "worse" adaptations, are still commonly used in biology, very often without good formal definitions. Biologists have not yet com- pletely dispensed with circular argu- ments; for example, phylogenetic tax- onomy is based on evolutionary theory and, at the same time, is used to confirm this theory. One can believe that with the further development of evolutionary the- ory and its formalization, the above- mentioned anthropomorphic concepts will be unnecessary, but at present they strongly influence sociobiological rea- soning, too. Wilson (1975) has discussed this prob- lem, and he has mentioned that there are some weak points in the theoretical background of sociobiology. In spite of these weak points, there are no good rea- sons to consider animal sociobiology as unscientific. Its theoretical weakness is not worse than the theoretical weakness of biology in general. Its achievements are of great importance, not only for evo- lutionary theory and ethology, but also for ecology and other related fields. SOCIOBIOLOGY AND HUMANS The application of sociobiological con- cepts and discoveries to human behavior and sociology is quite a different matter. Looking back at the development of po- litical and sociological ideas at the end of 19th and the beginning of the 20th cen- tury, we can see that the Darwinian theo- ry of natural selection inspired many writers to put forward naturalistic con- cepts of human society. These were based on the racist ideas of survival of the fittest, on the struggle for survival in a very primitive sense. The concepts were then very popular and are generally The author is with the Institute of Environmental Bi- ology, Jagiellonian University, ul.

They were used to justify social inequality and later became part of the Nazi ideology. Nei- ther Darwin nor even Nietzsche can be blamed for the Nazi activities, but the danger that social Darwinism brought to human societies was real and is still re- membered in Europe. With the further development of evo- lutionary theory and its wide application to the study of animal behavior, there is a danger of a new wave of social Darwin- ism emerging. This situation requires the greatest social responsibility on the part of scientists dealing with sociobiology. When one enters the domain of the social sciences, one should know more about sociology, contemporary history, and the impact of ideas on the behavior of in- dividuals and nations. It can be easily shown (Lomnicki 1978) that an inequal- ity in resource partitioning within a single species population increases the stability of this population. But one would have to be completely ignorant of economy and sociology to suppose that the same can be applied to human societies. The application of sociobiological dis- coveries to the study of human behavior cannot be denounced completely, be- cause the study of animals in order to learn about human morphology and physiology is a commonly used and widely accepted method. On the other hand, morphological and physiological differences between human beings and animals are very small compared with the psychological and sociological dif- ferences, which are enormous. There- fore, it is widely accepted that physical anthropology, human anatomy and phys- iology, together with neurophysiology, are sciences sensu stricto, whereas so- cial anthropology (ethnography), human psychology, and sociology are social sci- ences. Certain psychological and possi- bly sociological features of man do have biological bases, but some large and im- portant changes have occurred in human psychology and sociology during human evolution. Neither the suicidal behavior of some human beings nor the voluntary sacrifice of life for a large community like a nation can be explained by the the- oretical models used in sociobiology: group selection, kin selection, or recip- rocal altruism. DISCUSSION It is worthwhile examining what has changed in the human mind and what is left from our animal ancestors, but it should be done very carefully, by taking into account not only all the arguments for, but also all the arguments against. If some sociobiologists claim that group se- lection explains the origin of human eth- ics, while their opponents from the Sociobiology Study Group (1977) de- nounce Wilson (1975) for using pictures of male animals more often than of fe- males, it can hardly be considered an ac- ademic discussion. Social sciences have some peculiar- ities (Ossowski 1962) unknown in biol- ogy: There is the influence of the infor- mation about the results of study on the object of study, very limited scope for carrying out experiments, and so on. These peculiarities cannot be removed by sociobiological concepts and meth- ods, and therefore human sociobiology is not a science sensu stricto but a social science. We biologists should not guarantee drafts issued by human sociobiologists. In many zoological books, written by respectable scientists, there is a final chapter concerned with application of the ideas presented there to the human species. Chapters like that on memes in Dawkins' (1976) book were usually not treated very seriously, but simply as an interesting essay, a zoologist's personal point of view on the subject. This ap- proach is worth maintaining. One can understand some of the arro- gance of biologists, which makes them apply their findings to human societies; one can also understand that some social scientists try to become real scientists by applying ideas derived from biology. What is difficult to understand is why tentative hypotheses proposed by human sociobiologists are widely popularized among the general public. Are they going to solve the sociobiological controversy by a popular vote? What this matter really requires is a serious academic discussion in which the participants keep in mind that human sociobiology is a social science with so- cial and political implications. Many so- ciobiologists are busy popularizing their ideas, and it is no wonder that their op- ponents are really wiorrying about the political implications of sociobiology. It is a great pity that some of them do not have better arguments against human sociobiology than simply those denying the value of the whole of sociobiology. In our culture there is a long tradition, deeply rooted in our minds, of using ani- mals as a moral example for man. It can be seen, for example, in Aesop's fables and, more recently, in the popular books by Konrad Lorenz. There is also the fa- miliar concept of Jean Jacques Rousseau that everything natural is good and mor- ally praiseworthy. I am afraid that we will have to aban- don these traditions pretty soon. Recent studies on animal behavior show clearly that they cannot set any good ethical ex- amples to contemporary human so- cieties. Applying anthropomorphic mea- sures to animals, it may be said that they are morally abominable. Looking from the outside at the Amer- ican discussion on sociobiology, one gets the impression that its followers and op- ponents link the study of animals with the study of human societies. It looks like both groups really believe that ani- mals are our only moral example. I do not share this view. I believe that in America there are far better moral examples than the grizzly bear or chipmunk. REFERENCES CITED Dawkins, R. 1976. The Selfish Gene. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Hamilton, W.
