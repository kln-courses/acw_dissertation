<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brian Richardson Narrative Poetics and Postmodern Transgression: Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame We are currently in the middle of what appears to be a renaissance of narrative theory, in which several representatives of a new generation of theorists are provid ing ever more complex, nuanced, and sophisticated concepts of narrative and narra tive analysis.1 My fear, however, is that in many cases these new conceptualizations, despite the distance they have traversed from that mapped out in the past, still do not go far enough, and are partially inadequate for the kinds of challenges offered most obviously by postmodern fiction, though also present in many earlier antimimetic texts. In what follows I will focus on three areas of narrative theory?time, narration, and framing?and argue that most existing theories of narrative, whether classic or contemporary, are inadequate to comprehend many avant-garde, late modernist, and postmodern fictional texts. These three areas are basic components of the study of narrative discourse, provide the basis for G?rard Genette's highly influential work, and are the subjects in which narratology has proved most useful, even indispens able. The existing analyses of all three, however, presuppose a common mimetic ground that recent literary texts have begun to dismantle, and thus are more vulnera ble than, say, the analysis of character, which has generally acknowledged non mimetic narrative features. On the other hand, accounts of narrative space or progression would also benefit considerably from sustained attention to nonmimetic examples, though such work would I believe be able to be added to current accounts without much difficulty. I will begin with an analysis of narrative temporality, one of the most funda mental aspects of narrative and the one perhaps most in need of theoretical recon ceptualization. In this section I point out the limitations of existing theories, identify the most prominent constructions of temporality found in nonmimetic texts, discuss Brian Richardson is Associate Professor of English at the University of Maryland. He is the author of Unlikely Stories: Causality and the Nature of Modern Narrative (1997) as well as articles on several as pects of narrative theory, including second-person narration, character, reflexivity, reader-response theory, and the narratives of modern literary history.

I will then go on to speculate further and more briefly on two other, partially re lated aspects of narrative, noting again how postmodern fictions necessarily defy the theoretical models that were derived from more thoroughly mimetic narratives. On the subject of narration, I offer some additional analytical categories that seem to be essential to incorporate many of the distinctive narrative stances of the second half of the twentieth century. In my discussion of narrative frames, I attempt to identify the issues, texts, and theoretical approaches that can help us situate the very practices that would seem to defy many potential classifications. (One of the ironies that this article discloses is that many of those who break with convention do so in recogniz able, repeated, and at times even "classic" ways.) Here too Winterson's short story will provide a conceptually stimulating example as it constructs and conflates narra tive levels and frames. Finally, I will speculate on the effects and causes of the con tinued persistence of the "mimetic bias" in narrative theory. Narrative temporality is perhaps the area in which there is still the greatest de gree of general agreement (or significant overlap) among major theorists. The stan dard conceptual framework here is Genette's, with its basic concepts of order, duration, and frequency. These concepts build on and are consonant with the Russian Formalists' earlier distinction between fabula and syuzhet and theoretical dyad of Erz?hlzeit and erz?hlte Zeit, long present in several strands of the German critical tradition. Order describes the relation between the events of the story and the se quence in which they are recounted in the discourse; duration compares the time an event in the story takes to occur and the time its telling takes in the narrative; fre quency contrasts the number of times an event occurs in the story with the number of times it is narrated.2 Genette's account, it should be affirmed from the outset, is generally adequate to describe the temporality of virtually all nonfictional narratives, of the great major ity of works of realist fiction, and of most modernist fiction. Indeed, it was quite pos sibly the strikingly antilinear yet naturalistically recuperable texts of the modernists that may have originally inspired these investigations in the first place. But they do not work if applied to many late modernist and postmodern texts, since they are predicated on distinctions that more experimental writers are determined to pre clude, deny, or confound?and this is also true of some postmodern forays into non fictional genres.3 As Diane Elam has written, "postmodernism is the recognition of the specifically temporal irony within narrative" (217). We are in a position to iden tify several significant varieties of temporal construction that by now have become fairly well established?many of them will be quite familiar to followers of experi mental fiction?that nevertheless cannot be contained within a Genettean frame work.4 Among the numerous violations of realistic temporality present in recent texts, six kinds of temporal reconstruction stand out as sufficiently distinctive to warrant particular notice. These strategies, as we will see, are often present in earlier narra tives as well; insofar as they engage in logical contradictions, they are for the most</page><page sequence="3">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 25 part only possible in works of fiction. Though nonmimetic, they nevertheless bear a dialectical relationship to the concept of mimesis, since it is only through that con cept that we can understand its violation. The strategies include the following: 1) Circular. Perhaps the best known type, this kind of fiction, instead of end ing, returns to its own beginning, and thus continues infinitely. Its circular temporal ity partially mimes but ultimately transforms the linear chronology of everyday existence; it always returns to and departs from its point of origin?which is also its conclusion. The locus classicus of this type is Finnegans Wake; other earlier exam ples include Raymond Queneau's Le Chiendent (1933) and Nabokov's The Gift (1937-38).5 Brian McHale further points out that "[o]ther variants on the ouroboros structure include Julio Cort?zar 's Hopscotch (1963/7), Gabriel Josipovici's 'Mobius the Stripper' (1974), and John Barth's minimalist Mobius-strip narrative, 'Frame Tale' (from Lost in the Funhouse)" (1987, 111). Such texts, it might additionally be noted, problematize Genette's notion of frequency as well, since they are infinitely repeated instances of otherwise singulative events. 2) Contradictory. A prominent type of many of the more extreme postmodern narratives is the self-contradictory story, in which incompatible and irreconcilable versions of the story are set forth. In real life, such contradictions are not possible: a man may have died in 1956 or he may have died in 1967, but he cannot have died in 1956 and in 1967. But this law of noncontradiction does not have to be followed in nonmimetic fictional narratives, as may be the case in works like Blanchot'sL'Arr?t de mort and is certainly true of J. B. Priestley's Dangerous Corner, Robert Coover's "The Babysitter," Caryl Churchill's Traps, the mutually incompatible dual endings of John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman, and most famously (and egre giously) in Robbe-Grillet's later fiction.6 Ruth Ronen, discussing Lu Maison de ren dez-vous, has observed that "fictional worlds can contain time paradoxes where time is presented as reversible or bilateral" (202).7 In these texts, there is no single, unam biguous story to be extrapolated from the discourse, but rather two or more contra dictory versions that seriously vitiate the very notion of story {histoire) insofar as it is conceived as a single, self-consistent series of events that can be inferred from the discourse. For that matter, Genette's notion of frequency as well as his concept of story presupposes the existence of a fixed, retrievable, noncontradictory sequence of events, a sequence many postmodern writers refuse to provide. 3) Antinomic. There are several narratives that move backward in time (Eliza beth Howard's The Long View, C. H. Sisson's Christopher Homm, Monique Wittig's Les Gu?rill?res, Harold Pinter's Betrayal)', most can be easily situated within the standard temporal concepts that inform almost all contemporary narrative theory. Other, more complexly retroverted narratives however present more theoretically re calcitrant situations. Ilse Aichinger's "Spiegelgeschichte" (1952) is a doubly linear story that simultaneously moves backward and forward in time, as do later texts like Alejo Carpentier's "Journey Back to the Source" (1963), the final pages of Angela Carter's The Passion of New Eve (1977), and Martin Amis's Time's Arrow (1984).8 Aichinger's protagonist, that is, goes from her burial backward in time to her birth, all the while acting as if she is instead moving forward in time, looking ahead to that which has already occurred, as it were.</page><page sequence="4">26 Brian Richardson Thus, we get statements like: "Drei Tage sp?ter wagt er nicht mehr, den Arm um deine Schultern zu legen. Wieder drei Tage sp?ter fragt er dich, wie du heisst, und du fragst ihn. Nun wisst ihr voneinander nicht einmal mehr die Namen_Ein Tag wird kommen, da siehst du ihn zum erstenmal. Und er sieht dich. Zum erstenmal, das heisst: Nie wieder" (71). ("Three days later he no longer dares to put his arm round your shoulder. And three days after that he asks you what your name is, and you ask him his. And now neither of you knows the other's name.... A day will come when you will see him for the first time. And he you. For the first time means: never again" [74-75]). The first meeting, from one temporal perspective, is also the last one from the other perspective. With this kind of story, one can certainly have anachronies, though it's not clear whether?and why?they should be called prolepses or analepses. In a mimetic text, the narrator tells the story retrospectively (i.e., in the past tense), as the audience's re ception of the story is prospective; the interested reader wants to learn what has al ready happened. In antinomic narration, both narrator and reader are moving prospectively (present tense, even future tense), though time's arrow is reversed. Aichinger's story also includes jocular, tongue-in-cheek comments about this un usual temporal situation that emblematize its opposed chronological trajectories: "Vom Hafen heulen die Schiffe. Zur Abfahrt oder zur Ankunft? Wer soll das wis sen?" (66). ("Over in the harbour the ships are hooting. Does it mean arrival or de parture? Who can know that?" [68-69]). This joke is one that conventional narratology is probably incapable of adequately explaining, since it does not imagine that the time of the story, in a work of fiction, might move in two directions simulta neously.9 4) Differential. A curious temporality can be found in Woolfs Orlando, in which the eponymous character ages at a different rate than the people that surround him (her), as one chronology is superimposed on another, larger one. Thus, twenty years pass for Orlando at the same time that three and a half centuries pass for those around her (him). This situation drives the narrator to some playful descriptions in which metaphorical statements about time take on a literal meaning when applied to Orlando: "It would be no exaggeration to say that he would go out after breakfast a man of thirty and come home to dinner a man of fifty-five at least. Some weeks added a century to his age, others no more than three seconds at most" (70). This strategy is repeated (perhaps in homage to Woolf) by Caryl Churchill in her play Cloud Nine, which has the characters age twenty years as the society they inhabit gains a century. Borges 's "The Secret Miracle" also employs a similar construction, as time slows down for a man awaiting execution so that he is able to finish compos ing a play even as the bullets from the firing squad move imperceptibly toward him; he experiences a year while his killers perceive an instant. A still more elaborate de ployment of such disparate yet synchronized embedded chronologies can be found in Calder?n 's classic, The Great Theater of the World, where both the history of cre ation and the time span of a human life are collapsed into the actual duration of the play's performance. It should be noted that Bakhtin's account of the chronotope of the medieval dream vision, which "synchronize^] diachrony" to produce a time in which all events coalesce into "pure simultaneous existence" (157), is entirely con</page><page sequence="5">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 27 sonant with the differential temporalities of Calder?n and intriguingly anticipates more recent postmodern practice. 5) Conflated. A distinctively contemporary construction is that in which appar ently different temporal zones fail to remain distinct, and slide or spill into one an other. That is, as the story segments run into each other, so do their respective temporalities. We find this in Pinget's Passacaille, in some of later novels of Claude Simon, and in Juan Goytisolo's Landscape After the Battle. Accounts of one set of events fold into a different set of events, presumably occurring at another time, with out any framing device to clarify the relations between the disparate groups of events. In Simon's Les Corps conducteurs, we find a retarded, minimal, and res olutely antiteleological temporality; the narrative moves from setting to setting, and invariably the "separate" times and spaces begin to melt or bleed into each other, as the distinctions between each cluster of events begin to collapse, and "now" and "then" no longer signify clearly disparate times. A Genettean analysis of story or fre quency will rapidly lead to a series of contradictions and impasses, since there is no principle of identity at work that would establish what is and what is not the "same" event. There are also interesting variants of this practice, such as the contamination of the basic eighteenth century setting of Carpentier's Concierto Barroco by a brief and unexplained interlude in the twentieth century, Ishmael Reed's superimposition of modern technology onto the 1860s narrative in Flight to Canada, or the impossibly scrambled historical references in Guy Davenport's "The Haile Selassie Funeral Train." Another blatant use of this technique appears in Milan Kundera's Slowness, as the protagonist of the main, contemporary narrative is brought face-to-face with the hero of the eighteenth-century novel that has partially inspired the later fiction, and both characters are then encountered by the narrator/fabricator himself. 6) Dual or Multiple. We are now perhaps in a position to finally theorize that problem child of Shakespeare criticism and the poetics of drama: the notorious "dou ble time" of many of his mature plays, in which different plotlines, though beginning and ending at the same moment, nevertheless take different numbers of days to un fold. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, for example, four days pass for the duke and his entourage in the city while?at the same time?only a single night passes for the lovers in the enchanted forest.10 This situation is also present (and explicitly re marked on) in Byron's Cain: after Lucifer returns Cain to Eden, Adah expresses her thanks that he has come back so soon, after only "two long hours" (III, i, 54) accord ing to the movement of the sun. Cain, confused, responds: And yet I have approached that sun, and seen Worlds which he once shone on, and never more Shall light; and worlds he never lit: methought years had rolled o'er my absence. (Ill, i, 56-59) A creative variant of this strategy may be found in Ian McEwan's novel, The Child in Time, where the protagonist observes as in a film his youthful parents discussing himself before he was born in two recurrent scenes that form a retrogressive tempo</page><page sequence="6">28 Brian Richardson ral loop. A rather different dual chronology also operates in Nabokov's Ada, the world of which only partly parallels the world the we inhabit ("A gap of up to a hun dred years one way or another existed between the two earths; a gap marked by a bizarre confusion of directional signs at the crossroads of passing time with not all the no-longers of one world corresponding to the not-yets of the other" [18]). Other comparable asynchronies, though appearing more intermittently, nevertheless figure noticeably throughout Carter's Nights at the Circus. In addition to the types of currently untheorized temporal construction identi fied above, there are adjacent areas that need to be explored in greater depth. The most prominent, and the one that is now beginning to receive critical attention, is a contestation of the opposition between story time and discourse time. Such a distinc tion presupposes that it is possible to retrieve or deduce a consistent story from a text; in many recent works, this simply is not the case.11 Beckett's Molloy, to take a familiar example, can be said to have no recoverable story, and therefore no story time. Near the end of his narrative, Molloy wonders about an event he has just re counted: "Yes, it seems to me some such incident occurred about this time. . . . But perhaps I am merging two times in one, and two women, one coming towards me, shyly, urged on by the cries and laughter of her companions, and the other going away from me, unhesitatingly" (75). This question can never be definitively an swered, either by Molloy or by a narratologist, since in this self-negating novel every putative event is suspect or called into question, and may never have occurred at all; indeed, one of the central (and unresolvable) enigmas of the book is whether the Molloy narrative and the Moran narrative are different discourses narrating the same story, or whether they are instead two parallel stories with separate chronologies. In other works Beckett offers more strident and uncompromising challenges to the notion of a pr?existent, recoverable story that is independent of the discourse, as his narrators deny or cancel the events they had earlier affirmed to be the case (Mal one Dies, The Unnamable, "Cascando," Fizzles, III Seen III Said).12 This pattern con tinues until we come to Worstward Ho, where descriptions are negated right after they are uttered: "First the body. No. First the place. No. First both. Now either. Now the other. Sick of the either try the other. Sick of it back sick of the either. So on. Somehow on. Till sick of both. Throw up and go. Where neither. Till sick of there. Throw up and back. The body again. Where none. The place again. Where none. Try again. Fail again" (7-8). In these contexts, it doesn't make much sense to talk about a story (and, by implication, an originary chronological sequence) that can be de duced or extracted from the discourse. Beckett's work instead discloses a fundamen tal performative aspect of narration: that the setting of a narrative is simply that which is stipulated by the narrator, unless there is evidence to make the reader ques tion the original stipulation?and with Beckett, there is always a plethora of such ev idence, often quite explicit ("I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining" [Three Novels 176]). In such self-negating texts, the discourse serves to erase the story.13 And without a recoverable story, there can be no underlying chronological grid that is rearranged in the narrative discourse. The representational model of a writer tran</page><page sequence="7">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 29 scribing a pr?existent story is here dissolved and supplanted by one that stresses on the act of invention and the free play of an author who invents what he claims to re count; or to put it another way, mimesis is here replaced by poiesis. Salman Rushdie, it should be noted, offers a potentially more radical erasure. Midnight's Children, in which Shandean narrative arabesques are fused with the his tory of modern India, contains a temporal contradiction which the narrator himself points out: "Rereading my work, I have discovered an error in chronology. The as sassination of Mahatma Gandhi occurs, in these pages, on the wrong date. But I can not say, now, what the actual sequence of events might have been; in my India, Gandhi will continue to die at the wrong time" (198). This work's histoire negates the historical timetable that otherwise structures much of the text; it becomes insep arable from the discourse that expresses it. This strategy is a typically postmodern reconstitution of history that simultaneously underwrites a distinct postcolonial po litical allegory?Gandhi's death will always be untimely for those on the subconti nent, as recent events continue to demonstrate. The text types identified above, though covering the most prominent varieties of nonmimetic temporality in narrative, nevertheless do not exhaust the entire range of experimental fiction. Some particularly interesting pieces can probably be contained within the Genettean model; these include narratives in which time is virtually im mobilized, such as Calvino's "t zero," which freezes temporal progression to specu late on the nature of time, as its duration is arguably infinite, since all of its pages are devoted to a single moment in time that does not move forward. Beckett's almost lit erally timeless "Ping," which has (perhaps) no real events, potentially challenges the concept of narrative itself, inviting us to speculate on whether a minimal narrative can exist without temporality. Similarly, one should note the achievement of Chris tine Brooke-Rose's Amalgamemnon, which largely consists of statements made about the future?a future that is not clearly sequenced, nor always certain to occur as predicted?though this text too can probably be contained within Genette's model. Still other works however ask potentially harder questions. What are we to do with Gertrude Stein's cubist narratives that fragment and displace time, Jean Ricar dou'sLtf Prise de Constantinople, which was designed to be read either front to back or back to front, or with unbound manuscripts like Marc Saporta's Composition No. 1, which readers must physically place into a sequence? These too are issues that a theory of narrative temporality should address, not ignore or evade. And in "La Chambre secr?te," Robbe-Grillet may have created a story that has no temporality: there are instead a series of slightly different descriptions of what may be the same scene to which a reader may or may not supply temporal connections. Each scene is thus something like the literary portrait in Todorov's sense of the term, that is, a minor genre based on description, "where the suspension of time is obligatory (a characteristic example: Kafka's tale A Little Woman)" (42). Robbe-Grillet's multiple portraits, however, challenge or defy the reader to make them into a narrative by sup plying the absent temporality, thereby connecting the images into a single story. The alternative is to view them simply as a set of repeated and varied pictures. Both in terpretations, however, remain problematic?some of the "pictures" contain minimal</page><page sequence="8">30 Brian Richardson movement, while any story we fabricate around them will contain an internally con tradictory chronology. Genette of course is not unaware of many of the texts that defy his narratologi cal system. He admits that there are some narratives that will not allow a consistent story and its attendant temporality to be inferred: "Obviously, this reconstitution is not always possible, and it becomes useless for certain extreme cases like the novels of Robbe-Grillet, where temporal reference is deliberately sabotaged" (35). But such extreme cases continue to proliferate, and from certain vantage points constitute a new norm. As Elizabeth Deeds Ermarth has stated, "[w]hile all narrative is temporal by definition because its medium is temporal, postmodern sequences make accessi ble new temporal capacities that subvert the privilege of historical time and bind temporality in language" (11). It must be acknowledged that this new practice can only be understood by reference to the mimetic aesthetic it flouts; nevertheless, its rejection of conventional mimesis is often seen as an effective method to represent the contemporary world. At this juncture in both the development of narrative theory and the history of literature, it should no longer be acceptable to ignore the non- and anti-mimetic fiction that surrounds us. Alternative formulations that insist on temporal features unique to fiction have been advanced from time to time (especially in the last few years), and deserve to be better known. In the first decades of the twentieth century Viktor Shklovsky asserted that " 'Literary time' is clearly arbitrary: its laws do not coincide with the laws of or dinary time" (36). Bakhtin, in his analyses of the chronotopes of the history of fic tion, sets forth a number of concepts that still have not been fully incorporated into the theory of narrative temporality. This is particularly true of his discussion of the Rabelaisian chronotope, the distinctive method of which consists "in the general de struction of all ordinary ties, of all the habitual matrices of things and ideas, and the creation of unexpected matrices, unexpected connections" (169), a practice that of course continues today in the more playfully disruptive and contradictory chrono logical formations typical of postmodernism. Since Bakhtin, little significant theo retical work on nonmimetic temporalities was done until quite recently in the studies cited above.14 These are important developments that can lead not only to a more comprehen sive model of narrative temporality, but also perhaps to a better understanding of the nature of narrative itself. Instead of ignoring the anomalous or "impossible" chrono logical features or, what is practically speaking little better, indiscriminately lumping all such works together under a single general category, we would do well to identify several of the most significant varieties of antimimetic narrative temporality. We may use the term "metatemporal" to cover both unusual and impossible temporalities. A subdivision of this grouping we may, following Genette, call "achronic" narratives, which designate works that contain numerous events which "we must ultimately take to be dateless and ageless" (Genette 84); we will add, however, that this category should be greatly expanded and further delineated to include the various unknow able, self-negating, or inherently indeterminate story times present in numerous re cent texts.15 Those other works that resist or defy Genettean orders can also be given a general name consistent with the existing nomenclature, that of "antichronies."</page><page sequence="9">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 31 This latter group may include David Herman's recent notion of polychrony, as well as types derived from the examples already adduced, specifically the circular, the contradictory, the antinomic, the differential, the conflated, and the dual or mul tiple. We might also want to reserve some additional theoretical space for still other significant types of temporal construction?I'm sure there must exist some com pelling varieties that still elude the framework outlined here?as well as for innova tive works that will be written in the future. Finally, at the largest level of generalization, we may want to add some rough edges or admit deliberately blurred boundaries at the limits of this surprisingly flexible and protean category of narrative analysis by considering additional notions like the quasi temporal or even pseudotemporal to describe the kinds of works that simultaneously seem to invoke and resist a temporal analysis ("La Chambre secr?te" and partially nonrepresenta tional texts by Stein, e.g. "What Happened"). The metatemporal concepts I have just delineated can help us better describe the innovative use of narrative time in many recent works of fiction, as the example of Jeannette Winterson's story, "The Poetics of Sex," can disclose. The piece is com posed of eight chronologically varied segments that depict different stages of a love affair. The first one is partially iterative (in homage to Wittig'sLes Gu?rill?resl) and entirely nonspecific, containing no clear temporal markers except for the vague be ginning sentence, "My lover Picasso is going through her Blue Period" (311) and a reference to an event that happened "once." The second segment continues non specifically, with general statements concerning continuous states of being, but goes on to include a reference to the first time the two slept together and ends with a re calling of "yesterday," a day that would separate a partially metaphorical summer from the winter that was coming. The third section recounts the day the two met, a day that changes the narrator's perceptions of temporal relations: after they make love, Picasso asks her, "Come again?" to which the narrator's responds, "Yes tomor row, under the sodium street lights, under the tick of the clock. Under my obligations, my history, my fears, this now. I will not let time lie to me" (314). Part of her new perception of herself in time is reproduced by a narrative that blends the recounted event with the time of its recounting: "Love is you and here I am. Now" (314). The next section describes the infancy of the relationship; the narrator depicts herself as an infant ("when I was one month old" [314]) in order to recreate her new "birth." The following section is told in the third person, and again recounts the cou ple's first meeting, this time including a foretelling of the meeting in language that parodies the Annunciation. The sixth section begins with an invocation of the sup pressed history of sexual minorities ("Here comes Sappho, scorching the history books with tongues of flame" [316]), moves back to the temporally nonspecific, then recounts a scene from the past. The final segments produce the most intriguing effects. The penultimate one be gins, "I thought I had lost Picasso," and goes on to state that for "seven years she and I had been in love" (318). Before noting that "this last year" had been difficult, she makes two references to "yesterday," which do not seem to be the same day and are both distinct from the first day so designated back in the second section. Near the end of this unit we are told that "Picasso won't paint the same picture twice. . . . She</page><page sequence="10">32 Brian Richardson won't let yesterday's love suffice for today. She makes it new." Similarly, Winterson creates a new temporality for her story?including creating several new "yester days"?rather than reproduce the conventional chronology of the repressive society she attacks from the margins. The last segment states, "Picasso has loved me for fifty years and she loves me still" (320). The original yesterday is returned to and the story of the narrator's life rewritten. The day first referred to as "yesterday" is recalled again and is given a dif ferent outcome. The story ends in the present tense both for the narrated events and for the time of writing: "She is painting today. The room is orange with effort. She is painting today and I have written this" (320). This short story invents an original temporality to counterpart the events it nar rates and the themes it unfolds. In addition to some conventional techniques and metaphorical constructions, it deploys several of the temporal strategies commonly found in postmodern narratives, starting with sustained achrony, moving on to a col lapsing temporality (Section 3), and concluding with either a contradictory or self negating chronology (depending on how one reads the final assertion of extended love and continued presence). There is also the hint of a differential chronology in which the movement from summer through the end of winter is superimposed on the events of both seven and fifty years. The distinctive achievements of Winterson and other innovators can be better understood and appreciated through the kind of ana lytical framework outlined above. It seems to me that these are precisely the kinds of distinctions that narrative theory should be adding to its existing categories, the bet ter to explicate postmodern practices and their antecedents, and indeed to do the job any narrative theory should be expected to be able to do. It is time to employ a the ory that can encompass the insights of both Genette and Bakhtin, the genres of fic tion and drama, and the poetics of mimetic and nonmimetic narratives. Just as postmodern narrative has experimented with temporality, it has also ex perimented with voice. In many instances the ontological dislocation that brings about the temporal anomaly also causes related instabilities in narration, as well as other aspects of the text: when the act of representation collapses in on itself, a stable narrating voice is not to be expected. In other works it is a more general valorization of the decentered and a rejection of essence and totality that lead to (rather than di rectly entail) comparable ruptures in different components of the text. And the con tinuing literary impulse to "make it new" regularly brings forth types of narrators and narrational practices that hitherto were, I suspect, literally inconceivable. Naturally, theories based on the possibilities available to conventional or non fictional discourse (and including high modernists' attenuation of these possibilities) will be ill-equipped to cover the immense varieties of new narratives that bend, warp, or violate levels that necessarily remain discrete in the nonfictional realm. Genette? and I am using him primarily as a representative figure of the dominant mimetic tra dition in narratology?explains the fundamental difference between homodiegetic and heterodiegetic narration by claiming, "The novelist's choice [is] between two narrative postures ... : to have the story told by one of its characters, or to have it told by a narrator outside of the story" (244).</page><page sequence="11">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 33 This formulation?though perfectly adequate to account for autobiography and biography, and the sort of novel modeled on each?excludes precisely the kinds of play with voice, level, and frame that is typical of though not limited to postmod ernism. A contemporary author may well decide to use a "narrative posture" such as the second person, first-person plural, or other experimental form that problematizes the opposition Genette considers foundational.16 The antimimetic author will have to decide on still other options: will the narrator be a living human being, or someone deceased, an animal, or even a machine, as in (respectively) Machado de Assis's Epi taph of a Small Winner, John Hawkes's Sweet William, and Stanislaw Lern's The Cy beriadl In Genette's formulation there is no place for the even more outrageous narrators of Beckett's The Unnamable, Roche's Compact, Brooke-Rose's Thru, Calvino's If on a winter's night a traveler, J. M. Coetzee's In the Heart of the Coun try, and many other texts that were designed to resist or subvert the distinctions es sential to nonfictional prose. It is perhaps Coetzee (who has himself done work in narrative theory) who most clearly identifies the issues at stake here, as he distinguishes between conventional mimetic expectations and his own imaginative practice: When you opt for a single point of view from inside a single character, you can be opting for psychological realism, a depiction of one person's inner con sciousness. And the word I stress there is realism, psychological realism. And what is going on in In the Heart of the Country is that that kind of realism is being subverted because, you know, she kills her father, and her father comes back, and she kills him again, and the book goes on for a bit, and then he's there again. So that's a different kind of game, an anti-realistic kind of game. (Penner 57) No classic account of narration or "point of view" is able to begin to situate the prac tice Coetzee describes in this paragraph; all are based on the anthropomorphic pre supposition articulated by Wolfgang Kaiser, here summarized by O'Neill: "once we lose sight of the notion that the narrator is 'someone' who 'tells a story,' the novel is dead" (76). As we have seen, there is narration after the death of the novel, and its name is postmodernism. It is possible now to move beyond the impasse of an exclusively mimetic narra tive theory. Extrapolating from the account of "metatemporal" strategies outlined above, and building on the work of Monika Fludernik (which itself draws on both the analyses of McHale and Linda Hutcheon and the theoretical work of Werner Wolf), we can briefly identify some central varieties nonmimetic strategies of narrating.17 We have 1) An extreme version of the unreliable narrator, what I call the "fraudulent narrator," is one who obviously cannot be producing the narration he or she pretends to be giving voice to, as in the following passage, purportedly written by the eleven year-old narrator of Hawkes's Virginie: Her Two Lives: "Did I dream the darkness that wears soft the stone, like sheep in the narrow passages of a labyrinth? (The dark ness that changes in density and moves, magnifies the smallest sound, and lies so cu riously alive yet unsatisfyingly between the sleeper and all the activity he awaits in</page><page sequence="12">34 Brian Richardson the sun.)" (34). No eleven year old, however precocious, could produce such dis course. No wonder she states at the outset, "I am as impossible a child as the story I tell" (9). This kind of text points to the artificiality (or is it the ultimate unreliability?) of the basic novelistic claim that a writer can reproduce the voice of another. Other types include: 2) Contradictory narration, as in Robbe-Grillet's Jealousy, Coover's "The Babysitter," or Coetzee's In the Heart of the Country, which subverts and negates what is ordinarily the function of any narrator?to relate a single, intel ligible story. From a purely theoretical standpoint, contradictory narration, despite its rarity, may be conceptually as significant as existing notions of the omniscient or the homodiegetic narrator. 3) Conflated narrators, disparate figures who merge and blend into one another without any signal or explanation, as found in Simon's Les Corps conducteurs, Goytisolo's Landscape After the Battle, or Pinget's Passacaille. 4) Incommensurate narrators, who cannot be the single source of the heterogenous voices of the text; as Fludernik states, "neither a story and/or common situation nor a group of consistent characters, nor even a consistent narratorial voice can be pro jected from 'stories' like Donald Barthelme's 'You Are as Brave as Vincent van Gogh'" (287-88). 5) Dis-framed narrators, which move from one ontological level of the text to another in a way that is impossible outside of fiction. Examples include the claim of the narrator of The Unnamable to have invented the narrators of other novels by Beckett, or the statement by (and about) one of Brooke-Rose's narrators: "Whoever you invented invented you too" (Thru 53).18 In "The Poetics of Sex," Win terson alternates between mimesis and poiesis, shifting between a mimetic narrator who records the events that have transpired and a fabricating authorial figure who in vents those facts, as the oscillation between reality and desire that is present in every love story is embodied in opposite narrating stances. Moving now to the final area of narrative theory to be discussed here, narrative frames, the situation is rather different. Much less theoretical energy has been de voted to this subject; indeed, as William Nelles explains, its history has only begun to be sketched, and that "no two students of the genre appear to define it the same way" (1). Despite the lack of a common definition, however, the various critical dis courses on narrative frames do not have any particular space for or interest in an timimetic devices. On the other hand, much innovative fiction violates its frames in ways that are analogous to the disruptions of mimetic representations of conscious ness?transgressing the ontological position of a narrator often necessitates the vio lation of narrative levels, as the "dis-framed" examples, a favorite of postmodern writers, clearly shows. The standard position, as Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan articulates it, affirms that "narratives within narratives create a stratification of levels whereby each inner narra tive is subordinate to the narrative within which it is embedded" (91). This is a hierar chical structure and one which adheres to a basic rule of "non-contamination": events at one narrative level cannot directly impinge on the events at another; one does be come the story one tells or reads. But this is of course precisely what postmodern texts, in their assault on ontological hierarchies, characteristically do.19 Borges's hronir, examples of the intrusion of a fantastic world into the world of reality in "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," are accurate emblems and typical specimens of the re</page><page sequence="13">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 35 cent resurgence of this literary practice. Nonmimetic narratives regularly?even typi cally?point to, problematize, or violate the principles of framing that must be ad hered to in all mimetic or nonfictional narratives. We may even posit an unwritten "rule of the violated frame," that states that frames in the more resolutely antimimetic texts are generally established only to be broken, as ontological boundaries are vio lated and embedded narratives contaminate the worlds that are supposed to be inde pendent of them. One would think that any theoretical account of embedded narratives, narrative levels, or literary frames would include some serious discussion of the often irresistible urge to collapse the hierarchies and break those frames; in stead, such possibilities are usually rapidly dismissed or ignored altogether.20 For a more comprehensive account of strategies of narrative framing (again, de rived in part from the examples already adduced), we might well begin by differenti ating between "metafictional commentary," in which a narrator points to the fictionality of the story being narrated and indicates other directions the writing might have taken (Fielding's complementing himself on the way he has constructed his plot; the "disnarrated" episodes, as Gerald Prince terms them, of Diderot's Jacques le fa taliste), and "ontological framebreaking" in which one fictional level is contaminated by another (the various characters who talk back to their authors, who discover they have been invented by a higher being, authors who appear in their own fictions, etc).21 Building again on the work of Fludernik, we would also want a recognition of relations of incommensurability, in which a text is too fragmented or polymorphous to be contained within the boundaries that purport to frame the materials (Robbe Grillet's Jealousy, the "Cyclops" episode of Ulysses, Severo Sarduy's Cobra). We may also identify another intriguing, dialogical, and insistently modern type of fram ing, one consisting of different, antagonistic types of text juxtaposed within a single volume, each of which seeks to frame the other text. This possibility has been used in somewhat different ways in several works, including Nadine Gordimer's The Con servationist, Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye, John Hawkes's Virginie: Her Two Lives and, as we will see, Winterson's story. In addition, one would want to extend the brief but suggestive discussions of the mise en abyme?an automimetic textual practice?made by Mieke Bal (145-46) and Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan (92-93), as well as to incorporate Lucien Dallenbach's notion of aporetic duplication ("a se quence that is supposed to enclose the work that encloses it" [35]) and his account of the mise en abyme in the new nouveau roman (esp. 149-63). In addition to identifying these types of framebreaking, we will also wish to en gage with Patrick O'Neill's ingenious principle of the mutual relativizatiori between embedded narratives: noting that Isabella's narrative in Wuthering Heights reaches us at two removes, through Nelly Dean's recounting and then through Lockwood 's account, O'Neill asks, "So who is really narrating here?" and wonders how many al terations may (or indeed must) have occurred within this multiple transmission. He concludes that "While the embedding narrative is ultimately always in a position to colour fundamentally our perception of an embedded narrative, it may itself always in turn be challenged or displaced altogether by the narrative it embeds" (65). Finally, we will need to look closer at historically oriented studies that demar cate the rise and development of framing practices later considered normative or uni versal. John H. Pearson for example reminds us that "by the mid-Victorian period,</page><page sequence="14">36 Brian Richardson some non-fiction prose frames were themselves salient narratives, partaking both of the discursive world they enclose and the extraliterary world they exclude" (16)?a practice he traces back at least as far as Cervantes, and one that obviously frequently appears, often in exaggerated form, in contemporary fiction.22 Another look into "The Poetics of Sex" can help illustrate the full extent of the protean nature of specifically postmodern strategies of framing. Throughout the text there is a continual oscillation between figure and ground that destabilizes both posi tions. There is a sliding between the literal and the figurative, the mimetic and the al legorical, the "straight" and the ironic, and the narrative and the metanarrative. This slippage is itself emblematized in the lines, "The girl on the canvas was sulky. She hadn't come to be painted" (314). The girl on the canvas actually refers to the narra tor, who recounts the time she had entered her lover's studio with amorous intentions but was told instead to pose for a painting. Here the representation stands in for the represented; the painting may not even have been made (at least not then), the figure on the canvas is likely a projected image of the author's sensibility. This play with the narrated continues up to the final section in which the narrator, in apparent defi ance of mimetic conventions, seems to compose a Utopian new ending to her story rather than disclose what would seem to be its tragic, probabilistic conclusion. It is as if Winterson is flagrantly repudiating the classic ending to the hitherto official so cial narrative that generally decreed that gay characters wind up dead.23 The story also has another, physical frame: a typographically larger heading that appears to set off the narrative segment below it. These headings are in fact a se ries of rather vulgar, hostile comments directed to lesbians by a judgmental voice that clearly does not care to listen to any potential response. They consist of seven patent rhetorical questions, namely, "Why do you sleep with girls?" "Which one of you is the man?" "What do lesbians do in bed?" "Were you born a lesbian?" "Were you born a lesbian?" [sic] "Why do you hate men?" "Don't you find there's some thing missing?" and "Why do you sleep with girls?" A close reading of these head lines reveals their repetitious nature?not only are individual questions repeated verbatim, the entire series is primarily a set of variations of the first "question." It is a relentlessly monological discourse that has no interaction with the texts (and peo ple) it surrounds. It is both static and it forms a discursive vicious circle, never really moving from its starting point. What is especially interesting is the way in which the narrative proper interacts creatively with the headings that frame but cannot contain it. Thus, "Why do you sleep with girls?" precedes a powerful cluster of descriptions of the joys of lesbian sex that provide a rather compelling answer to the query. These include, near the end, playful phallic images ("the power of the sword," "slender as a horn" [312]) that are associated with each woman, thus obviating the question that forms the next head ing, "Which one of you is the man?," a segment that otherwise contains nothing male at all, literal or figurative. "Were you born a lesbian [1]" recounts how the lover mothered the narrator and christened her "Sappho"; "Were you born a lesbian [2]" reconstructs the prophecy and annunciation of the narrator's entry into Picasso's life. "Don't you find there's something missing?" recounts the loss of the loved one, and so on. The headings thus have an oscillating relation to the narrative segments that</page><page sequence="15">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 37 follow and are often generated by them. Sometimes the question is answered, at times it is ignored, but most often there is a playful response that either recasts, negates, or improvises on ideas suggested by the framing line of text. The two dis courses frame each other, though the interaction is entirely unidirectional: the clich?d text cannot seem to "hear" or respond to the rich, polymorphous narrative that both embellishes and refutes it. The brusque "public" text is a self-contained, closed circle, blindly impervious to the undulations around it that continually col lapse and recreate inside and outside, frame and text in the now well-established tra ditions of both postmodernism and ?criture f?minine. Narrative theory has been heavily weighted in favor of mimetic works and ap proaches since the time of Aristotle, who in the Poetics admonished poets not to speak in the first person, but instead to stick to mimesis proper.24 (On the other hand, one wonders what shape the history of criticism would have taken if his account of comedy?and thus the works of Aristophanes?had survived.) Nevertheless, many writers have preferred nonmimetic forms for millennia. For its advocates, non mimetic forms present greater imaginative challenges: the experimental artist must decide precisely how to construct time, blend voices, and fuse frames; in these mat ters, the mimetic writer by contrast merely has to avoid temporal contradictions, psy chological impossibilities, and the contamination of one story level by another. Explaining their practice, the authors of the nouveau roman frequently affirmed that they were uninterested in reproducing a preexisting reality; rather, they preferred to create entities that had never before existed. This is I believe a common sentiment among the more daring twentieth-century writers, and is presumably what Djuna Barnes earlier referred to when she observed: "With the correct artist we contem plate life, with the poetic artist we make a new one. . . . Realistic values sit before one, to interpret or not, as the eye is good or off focus; with the spiritual life the critic (or novelist) has more to record ... the one is safe, the other is danger" (xi). This more "dangerous" poetics is also one that lays bare and demystifies the ar tifactuality of fiction making. After all, why should a novelist continuously affirm the pretence that she is telling a true story? Henry James, in a well known remark in "The Art of Fiction," claims he feels shocked and betrayed when Trollope abandons the mimetic illusion and "admits that the events he narrates have not really hap pened, and that he can give the narrative any turn the reader may like best" (30). Why is it that we don't find James's response much odder that Trollope's practice? After all, the events did not happen, and the author can give them any turn that is desired. Antimimetic fiction is nonillusionistic; it flaunts rather than disguises its own fictionality. In doing so it sets another literary system in motion, as the mimetic (which can be transgressed, but never entirely dispensed with) is joined by another discourse that can mirror, complicate, or elude the represented events. One has as it were three stories: the events themselves, the drama of their unpredictable unfolding, and the nature, pattern, and purpose of their divergence from the mimetic norm. This can produce an artistically challenging complexity as additional elements are brought to the canvas, and as the story of the telling becomes as prominent as the story that is told.</page><page sequence="16">38 Brian Richardson There are and always have been two major literary traditions, one mimetic, the other antimimetic; one more concerned with the object of representation, the other with the act of invention. The nonmimetic tradition stretches from Aristophanes and Menippean satire (including Lucian's proto-postmodern "A True Story") to Rabelais and the more unusual Medieval tales to Ariosto and Shakespeare. Romanticism pro vides another rich body of relevant texts, as do the large, strange, and still prolific family of narratives claiming descent from Tristram Shandy.25 There is also of course the history of drama, whose general neglect by narrative theorists is particularly un fortunate since it provides millennia of rich, interesting, and inventive works, often avowedly antimimetic, that call out for the kind of analysis narrative theory can best provide. One may also speculate on the reasons for the theoretical neglect of these strange works. In addition to the general critical proclivity toward the mimetic (and, quite possibly, the inherent difficulty of theorizing such unruly texts), a key factor seems to be a widespread desire for a theory that would cover all narrative, fictional and nonfictional, classic and contemporary, high and low. For decades, a universal narratology was considered a plausible aspiration; obvious counterexamples seemed too few, too new, too obscure, too unique, too distant, or too marginal to demand in clusion. But the achievement and persistence of postmodern narrative strategies now means that we can no longer afford to ignore this cache of outrageously antimimetic narrative material. The time has passed when a poetician could comfortably ignore or dismiss such works as mere "anti-novels" that do not need to be theoretically comprehended. Indeed, it can be considered something of a scandal that narrative theory cannot encompass the works of the most exciting and dynamic creators of narrative of this century. I suggest that the most urgent task of narrative theory is to construct a poetics of nonmimetic fiction that can finally do full justice to the litera ture of our time. Paradoxically, by doing so we will be thereby able to recover and disclose the many premodern antecedents of strategies and techniques now identified as the most distinctively "post-." ENDNOTES I wish to thank James Phelan, Ross Chambers, and Monika Fludernik for their generous comments on an earlier draft of this paper. 1.

This period has also witnessed the publication of significant new work by major figures of the heyday of classical narratology, including Mieke Bal, Dorrit Cohn, Seymour Chatman, Gerard Genette, Gerald Prince, and Shlomith Rimmon Kenan. 2. Duration is further divided by Genette into four types of narrative movement: ellipsis, summary, scene, and pause (93-112).</page><page sequence="17">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 39 3. See for example Christian Moraru's insightful analysis of the temporal curiosities of Nabokov's auto biography, Speak, Memory. 4. My objections apply equally to accounts of narrative temporality deriving from philosophical hermeneutics. Ricoeur for example postulates a reciprocal relationship between narrativity and the structure of existence (165). The narratives I am about to discuss have never existed except on a printed page. 5. Leona Toker prefers to designate Nabokov's temporal structure as an infinite spiral; see her discus sion of this point (158-63). 6. Concerning the temporality of novels like La Jalousie or La Maison de rendez-vous, I must disagree with Ruth Ronen's claim that "chronology does not seem to condition narrative organization or to be relevant at all to the organization of the narrative world" (216). I suggest that it is more useful to af firm instead that the narrative world is ordered by (and indeed may be defined by) a contradictory chronology. Furthermore, its transgressive effects are dependent on the reader's perceiving and re flecting on the implications this chronology has on the fictional world. 7. Emma Kafalenos has recently coined the term, "temporal hinges," to describe reversible chronologi cal events in La Maison de rendez-vous. In this context, see also Ursula Heise 's theoretical analysis of the contradictory temporality of Robbe-Grillet's Topologie d'une cit? fant?me (113-46), whose nar rator "wanders down hallways and streets that always seem to give access to too many temporal di mensions, too many historical moments at the same time" (147). 8. Brian McHale identifies other examples of "reversal of process" in Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow: "Slothrop's family history (G/?:203-204), or of rocket production ('faired skin back to sheet steel back to pigs to white incandescence to ore, to Earth,' GR.139)?which seems to presuppose the ex tension to reality itself of film's capacity to be run backwards" (1992,110)?not, that is to say, of a sequence of linear story progressions arranged in an antichronological discursive order. 9. An important exception to this statement is Tamar Yacobi, who employs the category of "backward movements" to describe the following powerful antinomic sequence in a poem by Dan Pagis, a few lines of which can suggest the intensity of this work that verbally, subjunctively, "undoes" the Holo caust: The scream goes back into the throat. The gold teeth to the jaw. The fear. The smoke to the tin chimneys and further inside Back to the hollow of bones. And already you will be covered with skin and sinews and you will live, You will still be living, Sitting in the living room, reading the evening paper. Here you are! All in time. (112) 10. For a discussion of the play's temporality from the perspective of narrative theory, see my paper, "Time is Out of Joint" (1987, 302-304). That article also analyzes the unusual temporalities of a number of other intriguing dramas, many of them mentioned in this essay. 11. Theorists who have recently contested the story/discourse distinction include Ruth Ronen, who uses the example of Robbe-Grillet's La Maison de rendez-vous "to demonstrate the impossibility of di vorcing the order of events from modes of telling" (216), and Patrick O'Neill (35-57), who has ar gued against the stability of this conceptual opposition: "Perhaps the most striking thing of all with regard to the world of story, as far as narrative theory is concerned, is that ultimately we cannot ever 'say what really happened,' for that world, because of its status as a narrated world, finally both evades and exceeds description" (38). In addition, David Herman has devised the interesting concept of the "polychrome" to describe "a kind of narration that exploits indefiniteness to pluralize and de</page><page sequence="18">40 Brian Richardson linearize itself, to multiply the ways in which the events being recounted can be chained together to produce 'the' narrative itself" (75). 12. For a comparable analysis of the problematics of duration in How It Is, see Ursula K. Heise (147-75); on the oddities of the temporality of Waiting for Godot, see Schechner. 13. For more discussion and additional examples of postmodern fictional "worlds under erasure," see McHale, 1987,99-111. 14. Partial exceptions to this statement include A. A. Mendilow's suggestive account of Orlando (228-31), and David Leon Higdon's discussion of what he called "polytemporal time" in his book, Time and English Fiction, which does draw attention to the "destroying, ignoring or reconstituting clock time" (12) done by authors like Sterne, Lewis Carroll, and Beckett. 15. As David Herman points out, "temporal indefiniteness should not be conflated with timelessness or achrony: not knowing the exact temporal positions of several events occurring within a larger narra tive sequence does not make those events achronic. Further, both the achronic and the temporally in definite should be distinguished from the temporally multiple" (75). These are precisely the kinds of distinctions narrative theory now needs to be making. 16. For accounts of these forms of narration, see Fludernik, Richardson (1991,1994), Morris, and Lanser (255-79). 17. For an attempt to situate some of these distinctively postmodern possibilities within a more general theoretical framework that includes more conventional types of narrators, see Richardson (1994, esp. 322-25). 18. For additional examples of this kind of transgressive narrator, see McHale (1987,112-32). 19. Genette, it is true, proposes a category of "metalepsis" to designate a wide range of possible trans gressions between narrative levels. But this is so vast a category that in practice it may obscure more than it can disclose, including as it does everything from Balzac's innocent remark, "While the ven erable churchman climbs the ramps of Angouleme, it is not useless to explain" to the man in Cor tazar's story, "Continuidad de los Parques" who is assassinated by one of the characters in the book that he is reading. The time has come for a rather more discriminating analysis. 20. A notable exception to this general practice is Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan's discussion in Narrative Fiction (91-94). The most thorough work in this area is Fludernik's chapter, "Games with Tellers, Telling, and the Told" (269-310). For a wealth of examples meticulously assembled and analyzed, see McHale, Postmodernist Fiction. 21. Subcategories for conflated or the self-consuming, "mobius" type might also be desirable, though one needs to be wary of such categories proliferating beyond the point where they are useful. 22. Drawing on Michael McKeon's work, Pearson notes that Cervantes, in his preface to the second part of Don Quixote, argues for the authenticity of the text by drawing on (among other things) the testi mony of the characters themselves. Pearson continues: "Voices from the fictive world speak in the frame; and later, in the fiction, the claims of authenticity made in the frame are supported. Cervantes' second 'Preface' both mediates between and enleagues the real world and the world of the novel" (15). 23. Cf. Michael's pointed comment in Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band, "It's not always like it hap pens in plays, not all faggots bump themselves off at the end of the story" (81). 24. "Homer, admirable in all respects, has the special merit of being the only poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself. The poet should speak as little as possible in his own person, for it is not this that makes him an imitator. Other poets appear themselves upon the scene throughout, and imitate but little and rarely" (63). 25. The lines of affiliation between the unusual subgenre of the "Shandean narrative" are very difficult to map onto any other existing history or chronicle. How else can we connect Diderot, Byron, Jean Paul, Machado de Assis, James Joyce, G. V. Desani, Cabrera Infante, Salman Rushdie, and Julian Rios?</page><page sequence="19">Theorizing the Collapse of Time, Voice, and Frame 41 WORKS CITED Aichinger, Ilse. "Life Story in Retrospect."
