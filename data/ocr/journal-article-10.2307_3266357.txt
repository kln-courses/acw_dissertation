<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Biblical Literature Such "signaling" is optional (cf. p. 159 for the end of Judges 10) and complicated by the appearance of such clauses in the middle of narratives (where they obviously cannot sig- nal closure). Since units may close with either off-line or main-line verbal syntax, and since both off-line and main-line syntax also occur everywhere within units, has the author not merely stated the obvious: off-line and main-line syntax may appear within or at the boundaries of paragraphs, and either may or may not correspond with the termi- nation of a thought unit? It is difficult to see an insight here, for the reader is not told how to determine when an off-line sentence marks closure or not. Context? So what's new? I randomly selected narrative texts throughout the Bible to test his generaliza- tions, and they were not supported in texts such as Gen 28:5-13, 1 Kgs 11:14-31, or 2 Kgs 3:24-27. Does the book succeed as a mediator of contemporary text-linguistic concepts to hebraists with little background in linguistic theory? He does not claim to expect much of his readers (p. 86: "Precise understanding of all this is not required in order to follow the remaining material"), but such features as the introduction of terminology without defining it (although promising to define it later) will frustrate the novice (e.g., pp. 21, 22, 46). This will not be an easy book for a beginner, who is better advised to read (and reread) Andersen, Eskhult, Longacre, Khan, and Niccacci themselves. Samuel A. Meier The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43235 Biblical Dan, by Avraham Biran. Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society/Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, 1994. Pp. 280. N.P. In this book, Biran intends to "relate... the story of ancient Laish-Dan, chapter by chapter ... in its historical sequence throughout the ages" (p. 10). A brief introduction explains that "insatiable intellectual curiosity and the search for knowledge" (p. 21) drive archaeological research, and that, "for those of us who were brought up on the Bible there is an urge to visualize, to touch, to reconstruct the past and its material culture" (p. 21). Biran adds, "If in reconstructing history and societies of prehistory we must rely solely on the material remains found in the course of excavations, for the later stages of human development we also have the invaluable resource of written evidence" (p. 21). In addition to the Bible, Biran mentions references to Laish-Dan found in the Egyptian Execration Texts, the Mari documents, the records of Thutmose III, and the lists of Eusebius. Chapter 1 presents finds from the Pottery-Neolithic period at the site. The first urban settlement of the site, with seven phases of occupation dated to the Early Bronze II (Stratum XV) and Early Bronze III (Stratum XIV) periods, is the subject of chapter 2. Chapter 3 is devoted to a discussion of the Middle Bronze IIA period. Investigations of the massive eighteenth-century BCE ramparts and the striking triple-arched gate are reported in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 6 presents information, derived primarily from tombs, about the city of the Middle Bronze IIB and C periods, which was probably destroyed by an Egyptian campaign of the sixteenth or fifteenth century BCE. Chapter 7 describes the Late Bronze I and II periods as times of growth, development, and cul- tural exchange, with evidence of a metalworking industry and contact with Mycenaean Greece and Cyprus. Chapter 8 relates finds from the transition of the Late Bronze Age 724</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews to the Iron Age to the biblical accounts of the migration of Danites from the south and their conquest and settlement of the city to which they gave the name of their ancestor. Evidence for the metalworking industry at Dan is presented in chapter 9. The sacred precinct of the city from the tenth century BCE through the fourth century CE is the sub- ject of chapter 10. Chapter 11 discusses the fortifications of the Israelite period in the area of the city gate. Chapter 12 outlines the evidence uncovered for the site from the eighth century BCE onward. A fragment of an Aramaic inscription on a basalt stele, dated by the author to the ninth century BCE, and taken as the first extrabiblical refer- ence to "David" or the "House of David," is discussed in a postscript. Biran has made results of the excavations at Dan accessible to readers with an interest in the archaeology of the lands of the Bible but without special training in archaeology or in biblical studies. He reconstructs as completely as possible the life and culture of the city's historical periods, acknowledging that information is not equally available for all periods. He discusses cases in which ancient construction activity has destroyed evidence of earlier occupation, and explains that the archaeologist must wres- tle with decisions about the removal of the remains of one period in order to investigate the possibility that remains of earlier periods may be found below. The text has 228 numbered illustrations consisting of black and white photographs and drawings as well as 44 color plates. While the illustrations include references to the appropriate color plates, both the drawings and photographs could have been more closely linked to the text. For example, when an installation associated with a crucible and bronze slag is discussed in the text (pp. 105, 108), it is called a furnace, but in the caption of illustration 74, it is called a kiln. Illustration 96 on p. 137 presents a black and white photograph and a drawing of a Phoenician-type pithos, a type that is introduced in the text on p. 141 with no reference to the illustration. Drawings of a bronze and silver scepter head are shown in illustration 156 below the description of the artifact in the text on p. 198. The description mentions that "three circular grooves form four veins, or rings, a motif that appears three more times on the scepter head" (emphasis added). From the drawings and plate 32, it is clear that the motif appears only three times. Illus- tration 182 on p. 223 includes a photograph of a stone with a bilingual Greek and Aramaic inscription, a hand copy of the inscription as restored, and a translation of the inscrip- tion. While the hand copy in the illustration corresponds to the discussion of the inscrip- tion and its restoration found in the text on pp. 221 and 224, the translation does not. The treatment of some archaeological material and the relationship suggested for the archaeological materials and the biblical texts will raise problems for some readers. While Biran speaks of "written evidence" as an "invaluable resource" for historical reconstruction, he does not address methodological considerations for the evaluation of ancient written sources. Biran's discussion of the transition between the Late Bronze and Iron Ages is linked closely with the accounts in Josh 19:40-48 together with Judg 1:34 and 18:1-31, though he notes that the accounts of the conquest of Laish by the Danites in Josh 19:40-48 and Judges 18 differ. Those familiar with the debates on the Israelite settlement will note that Biran accepts Albright's identification of the collared rim storage jar as evidence of the settlement of Israelites in Canaan and barely mentions that this theory has been contested. The pits characteristic of Stratum VI and the other pottery found in them are taken as additional evidence of the Danites' conquest of the city. The designation of materials from the Iron II, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman 725</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Biblical Literature periods together as Stratum I seems problematic, especially since Biran notes that in the sacred precinct there were at least two phases each in both the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Because it is accessible to non-specialists, Biblical Dan could serve as a supple- mentary text in introductory biblical studies or archaeology courses and could also be useful for study groups in churches or synagogues. Keith L. Eades Upland, CA 91786-3026 YHWH Is the Husband of His People: Analysis of a Biblical Metaphor with Special Ref- erence to Translation, by Nelly Stienstra. Kampen: Kok Pharos, 1993. Pp. 252. ?59.90. In YHWH Is the Husband of His People, Stienstra promotes an awareness that bib- lical metaphors function not only as primitive rhetorical devices but also as crucial cog- nitive keys for interpretation. The book begins with a review of primary theories for understanding metaphor (chap. 1). Stienstra focuses on metaphorical concepts as coher- ent systems of meaning in which the cultural background of a concept serves as a "donor field" contributing to the "recipient field" of the metaphor itself. Stienstra then deals with the theological problem of using human language to describe God (chap. 2) and argues for a careful distinction between anthropomorphic literalism and anthropomor- phic metaphor. She takes to task those who would remake biblical metaphors into their own cultural image, holding that it is better to understand a metaphor's meaning within its unique context. In chapter 3, Stienstra highlights the cultural background for the book's model metaphor through a discussion of marriage and family relations in ancient Israel. She then sketches out the basic metaphor and its many corollaries as it appears in Hosea (chap. 4), and in other books such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah (chap. 5). Stienstra finds only hints of the marriage metaphor in the Pentateuch and suggests that the lack of its development there (particularly in Deuteronomy) may argue for an earlier date of composition than normally accorded by modern scholarship. In chapter 6, Stienstra deals with translation theory and takes issue with modem translations that do not remain true to the ancient metaphors. Stienstra's work is painstakingly thorough, and the frequent repetition of pet phrases such as "the titular metaphor of this monograph" is somewhat grating. Though tedious to read, the book provides a helpful contribution to the study of biblical metaphor. Tony W.
