<plain_text><page sequence="1">TALKING ATOMS: ANTI-NUCLEAR PROTEST AT DIABLO CANYON, CALIFORNIA, 1977-1984 by John Wills I ABSTRACT" In the 1950s and 1960s, a pro-nuclear narrative, largely established by government officials, dominated discourse on the nuclear age. Anti-nuclear protestors in the 1970s faced the challenge of countering years of atomic rhetoric. Drawing on substantial oral interviews conducted in the late 1990s, this article considers the language of hope and fear expressed by oppo- nents of nuclear energy in California. In particular, it explores the relation- ship that evolved between activists, their dialogue of 'anti-nukespeak', and their place of protest, Diablo Canyon. Talking Atoms' notes the high value protestors afforded to free discussion and expression, and suggest oral history as an appropriate medium for understanding a loquacious popular movement. KEYWORDS: Diablo Canyon, California; onfi~ nuclear protest; environmental thought A vast number of anti-nuclear sites adorn the world wide web. Their proliferation signposts the internet as a new virtual home for opponents of government policy, a safe haven from 'Big Brother' censorship or reprisal. For historians researching nuclear issues, the internet offers a means by which to contact activists and talk atoms. Virtual connections were used by this author to track down Californians who partici- pated in anti-nuclear protest during the late 1970s and early 1980s. A number of cyber- surfers had belonged to the Abalone Alliance, a statewide coalition established in 1977 to oppose a nuclear project at Diablo Canyon, on the California central coast. Protest events attracted a large contingent of San Franciscans, as well as residents of the nearby town of San Luis Obispo. Based in California during the summer of 1997, I interviewed over twenty activists, mostly in their homes or workplaces. Alliance members furnished personal files they had kept from the period, and regularly prof- fered names (unfortunately, not always with current addresses) of worthwhile contacts. Interviewees cordially discussed facets of Abalone life difficult to garner from press cover- age, providing esoteric commentary on the inter- nal dynamics and ambience of the movement. Despite the occasional chronological discrep- ancy, activists ably (and often vividly) recounted their experiences of Diablo Canyon. The collated oral testimonies afford a valuable insight into anti-nuclear protest. Fundamental to understanding the oral history of the American anti-nuclear movement is an appreciation of a preceding pro-nuclear narrative, foisted upon the nation by a triumvi- rate of government, military and industry offi- cials during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1953, President Eisenhower re-packaged nuclear bombs as 'atoms for peace'. Soon after, US officials promised 'electrical energy too cheap 44 ORAL HISTORY Autumn 2000</page><page sequence="2">Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, California (1997). to meter'.1 American schoolchildren were encouraged to think of nuclear power as 'Our Friend the Atom', an endearing cartoon genie courtesy of Walt Disney.2 Country and Western singer Fred Kirbey sang 'Atomic power! Atomic Power! It was given by the mighty hand of God'."' Atomic weapons were meanwhile granted super- natural epithets, from Roman deity 'Jupiter' to Scandinavian Thunder-God 'Thor'. The anthro- pomorphic nuclear family included the bombs 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man'. 'Minuteman' paid homage to militia in the American Revolution.4 Academics have since described the canonical vernacular of nuclear issues as 'nukespeak', in reference to 'newspeak', the official language of propaganda preached by 'The Party' in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949).' At Diablo Canyon in the late 1960s, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) used nuke- speak to gain popular acceptance for its nuclear plans. The corporation promised the local county of San Luis Obispo a 'future' of 'great potential'.6 Nuclear electricity would generate jobs and dollars by the kilowatt hour. PG&amp;E officials handed out atomic pins (badges) for local politi- cians to wear proudly. Securing a sanguine future for the county depended upon welcoming a nuclear neighbour with open arms. Notions of atomic progress ousted thoughts of wilderness preservation. The desires of conservationists to protect Diablo as a wild and rugged stretch of Californian coastline were ignored. Nuclear imagery obscured the trees and rocks of Diablo like an all encompassing coastal fog. The natural identity of much of the headland was lost beneath the atomic haze, particularly when PG&amp;E chose 'Diablo Canyon' as the name for its exotic plant. The corporation felt nonchalantly confident that it could sideline any criticism. In a brochure explaining the 'need' for the atomic project, PG&amp;E dismissed the objection 'Why don't you build it somewhere else?' with glowing self- aggrandisement, remarking 'This question may well have been asked about the first Pyramid'.7 When anti-nuclear protesters gathered at the entrance gates to Diablo plant in the late 1970s, PG&amp;E remained faithful to its nuclear enterprise. Despite a number of unexpected delays in plant construction, employees talked of safe and effi- cient atoms, and even donned T-shirts bearing the double entendre 'A little nukey never hurt anyone'. Abalone activists responded with their own slogans on T-shirts, including 'Make Mine Sunshine', and 'Remember Three Mile Island', in reference to an accident at a Pennsylvania nuclear plant in 1979. Despite the optimistic monologue offered by PG&amp;E, local attitudes had shifted from a pro to an anti-nuclear line during the 1970s. The American populace had become disillusioned with the atomic fairytale. Such social fallout originated in the work of indepen- dent scientists highlighting the dangers of radia- tion. Oral testimonies were used to discover Autumn 2000 ORAL HISTORY 45</page><page sequence="3">what 'really happened' at places such as Nevada Test Site. Ordinary Americans living downwind of atomic explosions replaced government experts as trustable 'nuclear witnesses'.8 Anti- nuclear activists in Europe and the United States articulated a language of protest, or 'anti-nuke- speak', outside reactor sites and missile silos. Gathered at Diablo Canyon, Abalone campaign- ers orated a fiery rejoinder to years of atomic affirmation. Members spoke of the atom in terms of 'profit', 'greed', 'danger' and 'secrecy'. They exposed nukespeak nomenclature, identifying 'waste', 'fallout' and 'meltdown' as the most illu- minating semantics of atomic dialogue. In response to PG&amp;E's anachronistic perspective on nuclear issues, a number of protesters claimed the letters P, G, and E for their own utility, forming 'People Generating Energy' as an alter- native voice on atomic matters. Alliance dialogue set out to dispel years of nuclear hegemony. In the place of nuclear promises, Abalone protest- ers offered solar power as a new electrical panacea. 'Make Mine Sunshine' revealed a tech- nological rather than luddite approach to energy policy. Rather than a government-led nuclear age, Alliance members argued for 'people power', grassroots democracy, and an 'open', 'sane' and 'life-affirming' culture. This article highlights the quest for an alter- nate narrative by focusing upon Abalone activists and their relationship to their place of protest, Diablo Canyon. Diablo was caught in the verbal crossfire between Pacific Gas employees and Abalone protesters in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and came to represent a keyword in the dialectical battle between nukespeak and anti- nukespeak on the California coast. Anti-nuclear activists presented a landscape very different from the atomic heaven described by PG&amp;E. From oral testimonies and contemporary accounts, we find 'Diablo Canyon' interchangeably described as a dangerous nuclear landscape, a place of protest, and a wild and beautiful coastal stretch. When talking of Diablo, interviewees commented upon the nuclear threat, their personal routes to protest, and the raison d'etre of the anti-nuclear movement. Abalone colloquy also illuminates a dialogue that occurred between protester and place, whereby activists not only shaped the land- scape to match their fears and desires, but that 'Diablo' transformed them. DIABLO CANYON: THE NUCLEAR THREAT No Diablo, no Diablo, no Diablo over me, And before I'll be oppressed, I'm gonna stand up and protest, For the love of the human family. No Diablo Abalone Alliance anthem9 Gathered on the edges of PG&amp;E property, Abalone activists chanted the song No Diablo. Their oral harmonies were set against the drone of police loudhailers and the rattle of trucks carrying PG&amp;E staff to work. Singing 'No' to 'Diablo' served sentence on Diablo nuclear plant, a choral vow by protesters to scupper PG&amp;E's insidious plans. The song was also a rejection of a wider, insalubrious nuclear land- scape, with 'Diablo' cast as a monument of atomic mis-guidance. Protesters Jackie Cabasso and Peter Lumsdaine associated Diablo with early memories of 'duck and cover' drills at school in preparation for nuclear war.10 Asked why Californians travelled to the San Luis head- land, Lumsdaine espoused 'the fear of a cata- strophic accident, the worries about what's going to happen with the nuclear waste, and to some degree, low-level radiation from the nuclear fuel cycle - 1 think those are the central things that brought people together'.11 Activists transposed their nuclear fears onto the physical environment. For Abalone Barbara Levy, an encounter with the nuclear plant exacerbated her anxieties concerning radioactivity. Levy recounted a trip by police bus to Diablo Canyon following her arrest: 'It was night at that point. It was lit very strangely, and it felt very spooky to me, and I was feeling nervous about radiation in general'. Held at the plant for some time, Levy recalled that officials 'let people off the bus to go to the bathroom. And somebody said, "There's the first leak at Diablo!"'.12 Levy told the story as if she had given it many times at dinner parties, a pre-rehearsed black comedy in the mould of Stanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove (1964). That PG&amp;E chose Diablo Canyon, the devil's canyon, for its nuclear project appeared a conspicuous sign of atomic malevolence. Protesters appropriated the name 'Diablo' and its evil connotations in their anti-nuclear campaign. On a sidewalk in San Francisco, graf- fiti pictured the two reactor domes as devils with horns. The grim reaper featured in a poster commemorating the accident at Three Mile Island, offering a nuclear plant with outreached hands, his dark eye sockets lit only by atomic energy signs, with a mushroom cloud rearing up behind him. Protesters pondered the origins of the canyon's appellation. Abalone Steve Smith claimed: The locals told us a story about why the place had the name Diablo Canyon. A Spanish galleon was exploring the coast. They sent a party of conquistadores ashore to see if the point was a suitable place to establish a mission. They all went mad. Killed each other. Shot each other. All of 46 ORAL HISTORY Autumn 2000</page><page sequence="4">them. So they sent in two padres to exorcise the place, as it was obviously in the hands of the Devil. They were both bitten by rattlesnakes, and one of them died. The Spanish never went back to the place.13 To overcome the lurking evil, protestors cried 'Hell No, We Won't Glow,' an atomic twist on the slogan 'We Won't Go' used by anti- Vietnam War campaigners.14 Upon release of The China Syndrome (1979), a movie critical of the Amer- ican atomic industry, Alliance members carried a coffin from the San Luis cinema to PG&amp;E's local office. Yet few Abalone earnestly believed that Diablo was a place of evil. During interviews in the late 1990s, not one protester talked of the canyon with recourse to images of devilry. Activists spoke rationally of the dangers of nuclear power. Diabolic Diablo seemed part of a propaganda campaign to show the immoral and misanthropic tendencies of nuclear devel- opment. Members had used sardonic wit against the nuclear dream, as well as radical theatre, to shock 'mainstream America' into listening. Don Eichelberger fondly remembered his role as a centurion in a 'mock-crucifixion' held outside Diablo Canyon on Good Friday, 1984.15 By rewriting biblical passages, protestors trans- formed events surrounding the death of Christ into a modern anti-nuclear parable. Appropri- ately before a jeering crowd of PG&amp;E employ- ees, Jesus (on behalf of the people) was condemned by the Sanhedrin High Priest (repre- senting the supposed interests of PG&amp;E, if not the whole nuclear priesthood). Whilst Abalone actors recounted their belief that 'if he [Jesus] was on earth with us today he would be joined in our opposition to the devil at Diablo Canyon', Eichelberger, as centurion, mounted the saviour upon the cross, only for the real police to arrest God's son for trespassing on PG&amp;E property.16 Looking back on the heyday of the Alliance, Roger Herried related that most Abalone saw Diablo as a 'life threatening' situation. Funda- mentally, 'it was a self-survival issue'.17 The nuclear danger seemed particularly acute for those residing in San Luis Obispo County. William Miller, who moved to the region in the mid-1970s, remembered his protest as initially a 'defence of a new home'.18 Pam Metcalf relocated from Orange County to San Luis Obispo in 1 97 1 . She had chosen San Luis because of its reputa- tion as 'a beautiful pristine place where there were less people and less pollutants. Really it was that simple, and I loved it here'. Metcalf was vaguely 'aware that they were building this thing called Diablo Canyon, but I really didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it'. Ugly electricity pylons changed her mind: 'My first sense of rage about it, oddly enough, had to do with watching the power-lines up all across the freeway when I drove to work. I kept seeing these huge monstrosities and I was really upset that we had to look at them'.H Metcalf decided to find out more about Diablo plant and atomic energy. Both William Miller and Pam Metcalf had been shocked by the looming nuclear project. Diablo represented an uninvited neighbour and protesters felt outraged at not being consulted. As suggested in the Abalone anthem, 'Diablo' had been 'forced' upon them, a form of oppres- sion 'over me'. Direct action granted them an opportunity to speak out, to have their say. Abalone chose to 'stand up and protest' in choral harmony. Anti-bomb campaigners on CND marches in England related similar desires to 'stand up and be counted'. Metcalf joined an early Abalone meeting, and was impressed with the budding anti-nuclear crowd: 'I was absolutely assured that there was nothing else to do with my life at that time than to join those people and to fight this thing. It was just one of those experiences where it snapped - I had no question at all that I needed to do that, that I would fight it as long as I lived here'.20 Talking in a bar in downtown San Luis, two decades on from her initiation into the Abalone Alliance, Metcalf remained enraptured with the deter- minism and righteousness of the anti-nuclear cause. Despite the Alliance having disbanded in 1984/5, there was a sense that Metcalf was still fighting Diablo plant subconsciously.

Abalone Alliance represented a valiant group of conscientious objectors to human destructive- ness, from the same lineage of Americans who had rallied against the horrors of the Vietnam War, and fighting the same honourable struggle as women gathered at Greenham Common to protest Cruise Missiles.21 I asked activists for their opinions on how exactly the Alliance interpreted the risks posed by 'Diablo' in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Pagans Brook and Starhawk remembered a genuine concern for the fate of the natural envi- ronment amongst protestors. Starhawk argued that members were 'concerned with nature and wider environmental issues', that nature was 'very much part of it'.22 Brook was not the only one to consider Diablo 'a great wrong' that endangered Mother Earth.25 Sanderson Beck,, in an email interview, explained: 'Nuclear energy and weapons are so dangerous and destructive to life and for such long periods of time that they have brought us to an evolutionary crisis which is a crisis of survival - for humans and possibly for mammals and may be even all life'.24 His sense of ecological catastrophe situated Abalone fears amidst a broader cultural fascination with environmental doomsdays. The nuclear threat was talked of in a similar fashion to 'the popula- tion bomb', chemical fallout, and global- warming. Don Eichelberger asserted that the Alliance understood Diablo as a threat to both the environment and humanity, that the two could not be separated. We all had the unity that the earth is ever- tied to human process, so to pollute the earth is to pollute humans, to work against human well-being', Eichelberger commented.25 Dennis Davie, today a member of Earth First!, a radical direct action biocentric group, offered a different perspective on Abalone consciousness. Davie maintained that 'the environment wasn't on the radar screen', whereas 'self (human) preservation was'. He recalled: 'Whilst some animal and plant issues were voiced during the campaign, the major concern was for the dangers posed to people living downwind... For me the biggest draw with Diablo Canyon was opposing the nuclear indus- try, not the environmental concerns'.26 Abalone activists, like their anti-nuclear counterparts across the United States and Europe, articulated first and foremost the threat posed by atomic power to the human species. The Abalone anthem couched protest as 'for the love of the human family,' rather than on behalf of a greater ecological family. That interviewees offered contrasting insights into protest rationale reflecting their own varied experiences within the Alliance. Members mixed in different circles, generally travelling to Diablo Canyon as part of a local 'affinity group' of approximately ten people. Disparate viewpoints on the nuclear threat demonstrated that the Alliance indeed functioned as an anti-nuclear coalition. Recollections of protest were also shaped by notions of environmentalism in the 1990s. Davie, as a member of Earth First!, was accustomed to differentiating anthropocentric from biocentric tendencies, and spoke more crit- ically of his time within the Alliance because it preceded his move to eco-protest. DIABLO AS A PLACE OF PROTEST Diablo was an interesting mix of intense local organising... liberals to radicals... and non- violent anarchist feminists.... and we loved each other... Chris Gray (Crystal)27 When asked about their anti-nuclear activi- ties, ex-Abalones often spoke of 'Diablo' as a place of protest, a location where a diverse bunch of Californians came together to rally against the nuclear threat. Diablo engendered much more than a concrete nuclear carbuncle. Albert Einstein declared, 'To the village square we must carry the facts of atomic energy. From there must come America's voice', and Abalones treated Diablo as such a meeting point, an ad- 48 ORAL HISTORY Autumn 2000</page><page sequence="6">hoc 'village square* for the open discussion of nuclear issues.28 Freely talking about atoms inferred a liberating experience, a step towards democracy and truth, and a move away from the clandestine practices of government and military planners. Protesters handed out leaflets on atomic energy to PG&amp;E workers as well as sun- seekers gathered at nearby Avila Beach. Alliance members concocted bizarre protest stunts at the gates of Diablo plant to draw attention to their cause. Dennis Davie recalled that, 'During one demo we built and used a solar sauna. The cops had to wait until we put our clothes on to arrest us. If more groups had used the 'nudity' tactic we might have tied up the arrest process longer/29 Cabasso remembered: There was a lot of street theater and creativity. There was one where somebody drove up in a limousine, and a bunch of guys in suits wearing masks, who were supposed to be PG&amp;E executives, got out, and they had a big model of Diablo Canyon, made of dry ice with black smoke coming out of it, and what happened is that the police came in, arrested the people, and then smashed this thing to bits. So here you have this absurd image of these police smashing this model of Diablo Canyon and the rest of us are cheering as we watch.30 Abalone symbolically reclaimed the land by their protest manoeuvres. Plants were sown, windmills erected, and an alternative society founded. In September 1981, protestors inau- gurated a mass encampment at Los Osos Valley, a few miles from Diablo. In the ensuing fort- night-long blockade of PG&amp;E's plant, over 1900 individuals were arrested. A number of inter- viewees considered the 1981 camp the apogee of Alliance activity. Jackie Cabasso described how her group 'took off, and experienced the encampment there, which was absolutely incredible. At the time, I thought it was like Utopia, because it was this huge self-governing community where everybody had a role, and it was completely peaceful and safe. It was really wonderful'.31 Don Eichelberger felt that 'people had a sense of something larger than ourselves'.32 Brook found the experience simply 'amazing'.33 The camp became a forum for coun- tercultural ideals, even for social revolution. Diablo was equally a story of Californians finding their own unique paths to anti-nuclear protest. Interviewees were happy to speak of personal experiences that led them to Diablo Canyon. For seasoned activists, Diablo signified a historic point along a winding trail of protest. Mary Moore and David Hartsough were both veterans of earlier social struggles. David Hart- sough related: 'I had been a part of the non- violent movement for many years. I'd met Martin Luther King when I was 15 or 16, and had been very active in the civil rights and anti- Vietnam War movement, and had been to jail many times'.34 Moore had 'been in the anti-war movement and then the civil rights movement', but felt that her background 'pretty much was unusual'.35 Moore referred to the large number of Californians that came to Diablo without any prior experience of protest. Hartsough agreed: 'I think hundreds, if not thousands, of people - that was their introduction to activity, actually being involved in a movement for change, that was where they cut their teeth'.36 Ward Young was one such person. Young explained that Diablo was -an opportunity to do something about his nuclear fears, and provided his first encounter with activism.37 Other ex-Abalone talked of growing up during the volatile 1960s and their awareness of the Vietnam War and the campaign for civil rights. Bob Wolf recollected the emotional impact of the original Earth Day, held in 1970, whilst Don Eichelberger remem- bered reading of the dangers of pesticides exposed in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962).38 A number of ex-Abalone explained their proclivity for protest as quintessential^ 'Californian'. Barbara Levy motioned 'because that's the kind of people we are here!'39 Ward Young felt that the stereotype of Californians as eco-activists had some truth to it, although envi- ronmentalism was far from confined to the Golden State.40 Interviewees also discerned that, in retrospect, the late 1970s signified an ideal period for protest. Concern over the atom seemed a global phenomenon. For Charlotte Davis, 'It was a very exciting time - there was so much going on. It was really like everyone, all round the world, was working on nuclear issues. It was really a good time to be involved'.41 The political ideals and organisational process of the Abalone Alliance attracted numerous Californians to the burgeoning anti- nuclear fold. The egalitarian and feminist struc- ture of the Alliance appealed to those who had stayed away from civil rights and anti-war campaigns due to concerns over sexism, machismo and elitism. Brook felt eminently comfortable with the anti-nuclear crowd, I realised these people were very different than those old organisers. I realised that feminism had left its mark on the way people were organising. Their commitment to equality, and consensus, and non-hierar- chical structures was incredible. I felt like I had come home.42 Ex-protesters proudly talked of 'feminism', 'empowerment', 'consensus' and 'non-violence', Autumn 2000 ORAL HISTORY 49</page><page sequence="7">the de facto keywords of the anti-nuclear move- ment on the California central coast. Rather than dwelling solely on the negative connota- tions of nuclear power, Abalone activists boasted a 'language of protest' based on opti- mism and positive change. 'Empowerment' was commonly deemed a venerable feature of the anti-nuclear movement. Starhawk found Abalone protest 'very, very empowering'.43 Pam Metcalf agreed: 'It was incredible to feel that kind of power about peoples' concerns over a single environmental issue'.44 Members of the Alliance had embarked upon lifestyles dedicated to social activism. Referring to a number of ex-Abalones still involved in community projects, Raye Fleming ventured that 'A lot of empowerment has stayed with those people'.45 Personal transformation was offered as a potent legacy of the Diablo experience. Several interviewees stressed that the Alliance spent a lot of time talking. Anti-nuclear actions were planned ahead using 'consensus', whereby members discussed issues until reach- ing unanimity. Whilst consensus worked well in small groups, protestors encountered problems applying the principle to larger crowds. Lauren Alden remembered: the controversy over using consensus within the Abalone all the time, that was a constant topic of discussion [...] when you were in jail with 350 other people, did it really make sense to use consensus? Often there were times when we had to make decisions - and the guard would come in and tell us 'you have ten minutes to make a decision' - we had 350 people, we had to break down into affinity groups, and have this very, very cumbersome process in place, and the guards would come back and say 'The ten minutes are up, do you have a decision to make?' Well, of course not.46 Levy defined consensus as 'very democratic, but it's also very tedious'.47 In spite of the 'gruelling, annoying' times, Phoebe nonetheless expressed 'a lot of respect for the sacrifice of time that people put into meetings. Sometimes it would seem they took all weekend', yet 'it was very inspiring to see the better in people', through their patience and dedication to process.48 Abalone non-violence frequently took the form of oral expression. Members practised explaining their opposition to nuclear power by using role play. Whilst one activist imitated a rattled patrol officer or verbose PG&amp;E employee, another Abalone offered a stoical yet friendly plea for an alternate energy path. When it came to protest, Lauren Alden related her own loquacity: 'I remember I spent a lot of my time at Diablo actually talking to the police, and talking to the electing officers, and talking to anyone who would listen'.49 Non-violence proved extremely popular in the movement. Ex- Abalone expatiated the virtues of living peace- fully, of rejecting the 'violent society' they deemed responsible for harnessing the atom as a weapon of mass destruction. Charlotte Davis apotheosized non-violence, recalling: One thing about non-violent civil disobedi- ence is its a transformative experience, it's not just something ypu do, it's something happens to you when you do it [«.] I know we've all sat around and mourned for those old days, and wished that it had gone on longer, sort of like the Summer of Love.50 Two decades on, ex-Abalone longed for the gatherings of old. Viewed through rose-tinted sunglasses, rallies at Avila Beach and Diablo became hazy romantic events. Interviewees offered their memories of protest as anti-nuclear rhapsodies. Despite Alden and Lumsdaine duti- fully pointing out problems over strategy and decision-making, the majority of ex-Abalones recollected few disputes. California protesters nonetheless established an egalitarian and inclu- sive movement worthy of retrospective praise. The Alliance proved remarkable in its blend of feminism, environmentalism, social idealism and community values. 'I think there was a spirit at Diablo that I've never really quite seen repli- cated at any other time, and the spirit was one of camaraderie', concluded Lauren Alden.51 'And we loved each other' ended Crystal's eulogy. DIABLO AS A NATURAL PLACE I came to Diablo to commune with nature and life. The golden and green hills are set with a sparkling bay and little fishing boats in a sunset all abalone shell colors. Extract from the Gemini poem, anonymous Abalone author, 198352 Pacific Gas presided over 10,000 acres of land on the San Luis headland, yet the nuclear plant occupied just 585 acres. Abalone who protested at the gates of PG&amp;E property remained several miles from their nuclear nemesis. Many activists chose to reach the plant site by using back-country trails across the Irish Hills, rolling country north-east of the entrance road. Their route incorporated steep canyons covered with ancient woodlands, as well as 50 ORAL HISTORY Autumn 2000</page><page sequence="8">dense thickets of poison oak, a shrub that irri- tates human skin. Press reports presented the Diablo headland as a rattlesnake-infested wilderness, harking back to pioneer myths of savage and devilish Mature." Back-country protesters nevertheless felt invigorated by their wild surroundings. The tree lines and winding canyons offered protesters cover from helicopter patrols, whilst plants provided tasty berries for trail-side snacks. The coastal scenery impressed its visitors. Recounting his trips to Diablo, Crystal enthused: 'I love California. The Irish Hills are particularly wonderful'.54 Traversing the Irish Hills was considered part of the 'Diablo' experience, and quite naturally shaped the way protesters talked. 'Diablo' took on spiritual significance for a group of Abalone pagans. Starhawk surmised 'the Diablo blockade' as 'an initiation: a journey through fear, a descent into the dark, and a return with knowledge and empowerment from within'.55 The pagan writer offered this recollec- tion of her back-country sojourn: With every step into the power of these woods I am beginning to care about them in a way I didn't before. Even sitting in front of the main gate, even riding past the twin domes in the police bus, the danger the plant represented was still somehow unreal to me... But now, as I feel the power of this earth, these trees, this place, and envision it contaminated, off-limits, ruined forever, I begin to get unspeakably angry.56 Back-country trails led protesters to discover for themselves the ineffable landscape under threat from the nuclear industry. Pacific Gas had colonised part of the headland for reactor construction. Abalone activists noticed the surrounding country at risk from a nuclear acci- dent. For Starhawk, the atomic project repre- sented a 'desecration' of sacred nature.57 Brook noted how 'people felt like I did - that the earth was sacred, that she had to be protected, that she was alive, and that this was work which was important'.58 Starhawk and Brook held rituals in the wild hills overlooking the atomic anathema. Brook remembered some success in pagan (as compared to PG&amp;E) 'energy work' with the appearance of electrical problems at the reactor site.59 California pagans felt strengthened by the knowledge that Diablo was a place of spiritual consequence for Chumash Native Americans. Archaeologists in the late 1960s had discovered a Chumash cemetery at the site cordoned off by PG&amp;E for the construction of its nuclear plant. Phoebe related how the realisation that Diablo was a Native American burial land 'helped rein- force the idea that pagans had of it being sacred'.60 Abalone protestors recognised the despoiled coastline as land cherished by the Chumash. Modern beliefs characterising Native Americans as ecological guardians contrasted with perceptions of the nuclear priesthood as prodigious land despoilers.61 Activists presented themselves as latter day stewards of the land. They practised environ- mentally-benign modes of living, by consuming organic food, running solar generators, and recy- cling waste products. They empathised with 'Mother Earth' and her pain at being plundered by successive human industries. Abalone conceived of their protest as a response to an earthly cry for help. Tita Caldwell in her poem My Mother the Earth described how she had been 'summoned' to Diablo by members of her natural and human families. Nature had called her there to act in defence of life.62 Abalone activists articulated a sense of belonging to the natural landscape. In the song Acres of Abalone, protesters chanted, I've lived all my life in this country, I love every flower and tree, I expect to live here 'til I'm ninety, It's the nukes that must go and not me.63 Map of Diablo Canyon and surrounding region. Autumn 2000 ORAL HISTORY 51</page><page sequence="9">Pacific Gas employees were implored to stop nuclear construction and listen to the land. Whilst the noise of machinery deafened industrialists to the sounds of disturbed rodents and birds, back- country Abalone, sneaking through the Irish Hills at dusk, appeared eminently capable of translat- ing the cries of the natural world. A century earlier, celebrated conservationist John Muir trav- elled the American wilderness, similarly immers- ing himself in the sights and sounds of the 'great outdoors*. With his natural family keeping him company, the Scottish-born Californian was never alone on his back-country wanderings. Along a stream in Tennessee, Muir received his 'most impressive sermon' from a 'cheerful confiding bird'.64 Lacking the audio equipment of modern ornithologists and oral historians, Muir had no way of recording the bird-talk. Whether inter- preted as sentimental anthropomorphism, or as a radical call to broaden the field of oral history, Muir certainly proved adept at listening to his natural brethren, and speaking in their defence. Abalones also presented themselves as defenders of nature and claimed Mother Earth as their ally. THE END OF ANTI-NUKESPEAK? When, in 1997, ex- Abalone recalled their protest experience, Diablo nuclear plant had been producing commercial electricity for thir- teen years. Blockades and mass action by the Alliance had failed to stop PG&amp;E's reactors from going on-line. Whilst a number of ex- activists still felt anxious. over their nuclear neighbour, the passage of time had assuaged some of the fear. Bob Wolf admitted: 'Pve kind of put it out of my mind, which I think a lot of people did'.65 'Diablo' had come to represent a powerful memory. The operational power plant seemed less significant, despite its shadow over the present. The general demise of the nuclear industry in the 1980s and 1990s helped interviewees cast their actions as part of a larger victory against atomic forces. Starhawk summarized the popular belief that 'We lost the battle, but we won the war*.66 Substantial cost overruns, safety violations, and the thawing of the Cold War left the nuclear cause with few vociferous supporters. Anti-nuke- speak had played a vital role in laying bare the secrets and myths of the nuclear cabal, and duti- fully deconstructed nukespeak. The public had been given a choice of narratives. The Abalone Alliance used posters, billboards, theatre, and telephone calls to spread their message. Modern protesters also employ the world wide web to promote anti-nuclear discourse. In the late 1960s, the US Department of Defense devised ARPAnet (the precursor of the internet) as an elite commu- nication network designed to survive the impact of nuclear war. The anti-nuclear movement helped install a sense of open communication and debate on atomic matters, and raised the possi- bility of preventing nuclear incidents rather than planning for them. NOTES I • President Eisenhower introduced the term 'Atoms for Peace' in a speech to the United Nations in December 1953. Lewis Strauss, then Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, spoke of 'electrical energy too cheap to meter' at a meeting of the National Association of Science Writers in 1954. Both phrases became platitudes of the pranuclear fifties. 2. Our Friend the Atom, Walt Disney, 1 956. 3. Kirbey's song noted in Spencer Weart, Nuclear Fear: A History of Images, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University, 1988, p 395. 4. Nuclear phraseology is notoriously euphemistic, if not downright misleading. Along with the 'peacekeeper' weapon, other examples include 'cruise' missiles, imparting notions of holiday ocean trips, and the 'cookie cutter', suggesting a fairly harmless kitchen utensil rather than the neutron bomb. 5. The term 'nukespeak' can be accredited to academics on both sides of the Atlantic. Paul Chilton used the phrase in a speech to the Institute of Contemporary Arts on Hiroshima Day, 1 98 1 , and later in 'Nuclear Language, culture and propaganda', Crispin Aubrey (ed), Nukespeak: The Media and the Bomb, London: Comedia, 1 982, and Paul Chilton (ed), Language and the Nuclear Arms Debate: Nukespeak Today, London: Frances Pinter, 1985. Stephen Hilgartner, Richard Bell, and Rory O'Connor, meanwhile titled their book on nuclear propaganda, first published in 1982, Nukespeak: Nuclear Language, Visions, and Mindset, San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1 982. Whilst Chilton defined 'nukespeak' as a distinctive dialogue associated with nuclear war and weaponry, Hilgartner, Bell and O'Connor utilised the term to describe 'the language of the nuclear mindset - the world view, or system of beliefs - of nuclear developers' (p xiii). The author has used 'nukespeak' in the broader sense offered by Hilgartner et. al. 6.
