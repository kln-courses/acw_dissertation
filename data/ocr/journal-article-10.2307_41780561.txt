It is the first site of its kind excavat- ed in the country, and has yielded 13,000-year-old stone artifacts and the bones of two juvenile gom- photheres, mastodons with distinc- tive lower tusks, that had probably been hunted or scavenged. CHILE: Four female skulls 500- to cerne- per- haps used by the farming and llama- breeding Atacameño culture, appeared to have been partially dis- solved. DNA has helped solve the mystery of what caused the dam- age. Researchers discovered that the women had leishmanasis, a par- asitic disease that causes erosive sores. However, the parasite is not endemic to the area because of its dry climate and high altitude, sug- gesting the women had migrated there, perhaps from tropical low- lands 250 miles away.

PERU: Analysis of pollen, floral remains, and sediments suggests the Nazca civilization may have committed ecocide. The study found that plant life in the desert they occupied changed over time, from huarango trees to maize to weeds. Among other things, the trees helped mitigate flood damage and replenish aquifers. But with them gone because of agriculture, the floods from an a.D. 500 El Niño event spelled doom for the society famous for its massive geoglyphs. BOTSWANA: In a large, dry lake basin in the Kalahari, scientists have begun to study some of the most extensive evidence of Middle Stone Age life in the southern African interior. Among the discoveries are quantities of stone tools that will help show how humans coped with wet and dry periods around 150,000 years ago. Some of the hand axes are the size of dinner plates.

Some of the hundreds of fibers were spun, cut, or dyed. The flax, collected from wild plants around 34,000 years ago, could have been used to make thread to tie stone tools to handles, weave baskets, or sew colorful clothes. TURKEY: Small figurines of humans and animals such as cattle and sheep from the 9,000-year-old town of Çatalhôyûk have long been thought to have religious significance. But because they are rarely found in niches or altars, some researchers now believe that they were more like toys or teaching aides, commonly carried and easily discarded. GREECE: In the first year of a new project at the submerged site of Pavlopetri, archaeologists found that the Mycenaean town was actually first established around 5,000 years ago, some 1,200 years earlier than previously thought. They also identi- fied 10,000 square feet of new build- ings, including what might be an Early Bronze Age megaron, or great hall. The later Mycenaeans are well known for their palaces and citadels, but this site offers a perspective on provincial life and maritime trade. i ISRAEL: In what was once a shop in the Roman city ■|^ of Hippos, excavators found a cache of three Hi Aphrodite figurines- in her "Venus pudica" form, ¡¡■t in which she covers her nether regions with her mw hand.

CHINA: The ranks of the famed terracotta army of Xi'an are growing, but be wary of what you read about them. Over the summer, archaeolo- gists began the first new excavation of soldiers in 20 years, in part because of advances that will help preserve some of their original color- ful paint. Since the work began, several stories about the finds- from the purported discovery of hundreds of new soldiers to ones without beards- have made the rounds. But those are not true; it may be some time before the site's museum announces official results. www.archaeology.org TI</page><page sequence="4">Archaeologists from the Stonehenge Riverside Project stand where megaliths were once placed at the newly discovered "Bluestonehenge." A circular ditch surrounded the site. - ■ Bluestonehenge Over evidence archaeologists the past of a two previously have years, archaeologists have unearthed evidence of a previously unknown stone circle less than two miles from Stonehenge* Dubbed " Bluestonehenge" by members of the Stonehenge Riverside Project, a consortium of researchers from several British universities, the circle may have once included 24 standing stones known as bluestones, six-foot-tall megaliths that were brought from quarries in the Preseli Hills 150 miles away The new discovery supports the theory that Stonehenge was the center of a Neolithic ritual mortuary complex - "the domain of the dead" - while the nearby timber-post sites of Durrington Walls and Woodhenge were the "domain of the living" (see "Sacred Stones," page 18)* The team discovered the site while excavating at the end of "the avenue," a path from Stonehenge to the nearby Avon Riven "It was a complete surprise for the circle to be there," says project codirector and University of Manchester archaeologist Julian Thomas* "But finding it makes sense in context* Perhaps bodies were cremated at Bluestonehenge, their ashes taken up the avenue to be buried at Stonehenge " Though the team did not find any complete stones, they discovered fragments in holes similar to ones that once held Preseli bluestones at Stonehenge* "They were clearly taken away at some point," says Thomas* "They could have been taken to Stonehenge, and its possible some of the bluestones standing there now once stood at Bluestonehenge" Though Neolithic tools and arrowheads have been found at the You probably know the eastern Caribbean Is a great piace for scuba diving , but it also has a number of historical sites worth visiting. If you're ever In the Lesser Antilles , Northwestern University archaeologist Mark Hauser suggests you see the ruins of Bols Cotlette, a seldom-visited plantation site on the small Island of Dominica, òefiveen Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Site: A coffee estate that also processed sugar and cocoa during its almost 300-year history, Bois Cotlette dates to the early days of French settlement, perhaps the 1750s. After the British colonized the island in 1763, the French owners continued to live on the estate. Today, it includes the ruins of a windmill, the owner's house, and stables, as well as a recon- structed coffee-pulping mill. Excavations have yielded ceramics from Martinique and even southeastern France that suggest slaves participated in an informal economy that extended beyond the island. Getting There: Bois Cotlette is in Dominica's Soufriere Valley, a 45-minute drive from Roseau, the island's capital. To get there, you will need to hire a taxi or rent a 4x4 (the last leg of the journey is up a rocky road). Once you find the plantation, you are free to wander the grounds. There is no admission fee and Michael Didier, the current owner, will be happy to give you an informal tour. While on Dominica: Stop by the Dominica Museum on the Roseau waterfront. Housed on the second floor of an 18th-century building that was once a post office, the museum features pre-Columbian pottery and shell tools, as well as historical exhibits that will give you a context for understanding Bois Cotlette. Lennox Honychurch, a cultural anthropologist and curator of the museum, can tell you stories about the island's history (his website is www. lennoxhonychurch.com).

Models show people at work, doing for eternity what they did in life for Djehutynakht. There are brewery-bakeries, carpentry and weaving shops, mud-brick factories, granaries, and cattle being fed or pulling plows.

In some ways, Ardipithecus is an awkward fit for a human ances- tor living 4»4 million years ago» In general, the overall body size of hominins tends to increase through time, and the size difference between males and females, called sexual dimorphism, becomes less» Just 200,000 years after Ardi lived, Aus- tralopithecus anamensis arrives in the fossil record, looking more like later human ancestors» Ardipithecus seems to be larger and there is less difference in size between males and females than there is in Australo- pithecus, which in some ways makes it more like its ape ancestors than Ardipithecus*" By showing that at 4 A million years there is a hominin ancestor that is less dimorphic than Australopithecus is, I think, very exciting because that is not what you would have predicted," says Zer- esenay Alemseged, a paleoanthro- pologist at the California Academy of Sciences» "We do not necessarily become more apelike or more primi- tive as we go back in time»" Others see these differences as less exciting and more of a reason to doubt that Ardipithecus is a human ancestor» "The jury is still out on this» There has to be a series of important rever- sals just going from Ardipithecus to Australopithecus" says Jungers»"If Australopithecus is sexually dimor- phic and Ardipithecus isn't, that's kind of peculiar»" New fossil dis- coveries will be needed to settle the question of ancestry» In the 15 years since finding the first piece of the Ardi skeleton, Haile-Selassie has risen to become the head of the physical anthropol- ogy department at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History» He was also involved in the analysis of Ardi's habitat and biology» "We have opened up a huge forum for discussion about human origins," he says, "at the same time, we are going to have to rewrite our textbooks because we are finding early ances- tors that we never expected to see in the fossil record»" Part of those future textbook revisions may come from a site called Woranso-Mille in the Afar region where Haile-Selassie has uncovered the remains of a 3»6- to 3»8-million-year-old hominin that may reveal more information about Australopithecus anamensis » In the meantime, no one seems willing to say that Ardipithecus was definitively a direct human ancestor» "I'd say I'm 50/ 50," says Lovejoy, chuckling»"There is really no reason to believe that there couldn't have been another [hominin] which was more advanced and was the real ancestor of anamensis »" Begun echoes that idea» "I do think it probably is a hominin; in other words, it was more closely related to humans than chimpanzees, but I'm not convinced it was a biped» I'm not convinced it looked all that different from a chimpanzee, and I'm not convinced that it's directly related to Australo - pithecines as opposed to something that branched off very early on»»»and then went extinct»" But the debates are just getting started» "Controversy is going to happen almost no matter what," says White, "believe me, we haven't even seen the beginning of the controversy yet»" - Zach Zorich 50 ARCHAEOLOGY • January/February 2010</page></plain_text>
