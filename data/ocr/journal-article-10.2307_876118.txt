<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT MUSEUM ACQUISITIONS Maisur, thirteenth-century 'Nandi' (Philadelphia Museum of Art) THE image of the sacred bull of Shiva, like all the monuments of the Hoysala dynasty, is carved of indurated potstone, which in the thirteenth century is intricately elaborated in the details of its ornaments. Different, however, from the anthropomorphic images of the Hoysala school, the intricacies of carved detail in this Nandi (Fig.42) do not obscure or impede the modelling of the figure, the vitality of its head, the relaxation of its recumbent body. Nandi, the humped bull (bos indicus), conveys Shiva in every sense for not only is he the conveyance of the God, originally he conveys the presence of Shiva and stands for Shiva himself. In the hymns of the RigVeda, the most sacred and ancient book of India, the gods are invoked as bulls. It is in the image of this ani- mal that their power is invoked. The place of Nandi, the sacred bull, is in the open, sometimes in a pillared pavilion of his own. His image faces the temple of Shiva which enshrines the linga. Sometimes the shape of the hump of Nandi is assimilated to a linga which is the symbol of the god's potency. The word Nandi means delight. The image of Nandi incorporates the joy in creation.</page><page sequence="2">43. Torso of a Buddha Image. Sarnath, c. third quarter of the fifth century.
