<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS CHAUCER'S IRONY A MODERN DISCOVERY? "The gay, incomparably felicitous irony of Chaucer is as precious to us today as any other mark of his genius, yet between his generation and our own it lay unregarded, a quality which there were few to know, and very few to love."1 This recent pic turing of Chaucer's irony as a violet only now uncovered from the moss of the centuries deserves to be scrutinized, if only in fairness to our ancestors, and all the more as it seems to repre sent an opinion widely held. In one of the latest monographs on Chaucer, Professor Patch writes: "In the long history of the ap preciation of Chaucer's poetry, as it is spread before us in Miss Spurgeon's Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allu sion, one may see that understanding of his humor has been slow in developing. 'It is not . . . until well on in the nineteenth century,' Miss Spurgeon observes, 'not indeed until Leigh Hunt wrote on it in 1846, that Chaucer's humour seems to have met with any adequate recognition.'"2 Now it is possible, though unprovable, that we of this century recognize more of Chaucer's jokes?more, perhaps, than he made?but it is certain that the invaluable roster of references which Miss Spurgeon herself col lected, and those which others have since supplied, offer abun dant proof that not only Chaucer's broad mirth but his slyest innuendo never at any time dwelt among the untrodden ways of criticism. Since it is the ironic flavor of Chaucer's humor which is felt to be the modern discovery I shall concern myself here mainly with the history of its recognition. In doing so I shall keep in mind that both 'irony' and 'humor' did not develop their com plex present-day meanings until at least the mid-eighteenth century. When Miss Spurgeon stated that Thomas Warton was the first to associate the poet's art with our idea of humor she was writing not about Chaucer appreciation, but about seman tics.3 'Irony,' even in the narrower senses of verbal ambiguity 1 David Worcester, The Art of Satire (Harvard University Press, 1940), p. 95. 2 On Rereading Chaucer (Harvard University Press, 1939), p. 5. 3 Caroline F.

The NED lists one appearance as early as 1502 but the word is not popular until after the writings of Bishop Thirlwall. With reference to Chaucer I find no earlier use of the term than in a note of Thomas Gray's, about 1760, where, ironically enough, the immediate application is to Lydgate.4 Nevertheless, long before Gray, readers were smiling with Chau cer at the incongruities of his pilgrims, exploring his hidden satire, and experiencing the curious grim elation that comes from the witnessing of an irony of circumstance. Among Chaucer's contemporaries or immediate successors, the illuminator of the Ellesmere MS, at least, was aware of the poet's humor. Mr. Edward F. Piper, in his study of the illustra tions to the Prologue, stresses the artist's appreciation of "Chau cer's use of costume to express personality," of his realism and his comic drama. As if to ensure that readers should not be mis led by the quietness of Chaucer's reference to the monk's jingling bridle, the embellisher hangs on the monk's horse a profusion of bells and bosses from ears to crupper. The cook's mormal is a major wound, and both the miller's thumbs are gilded.6 One might add, to Mr. Piper's observations, that the most prominent object in the physician's miniature is not simply a 'green flask . . . introduced ... as a professional object' (p. 248) but a 'hip pocras' shining with gold cordial; the pardoner is made distinctly effeminate, by an exaggeration of his vernicle and his locks, and his 'male' is so big it hangs like a feed-bag around his horse's neck; the monk's hounds are large, sleek, and expensively adorned; and the prioress' forehead is almost grotesquely broad, and her red beads very conspicuous?though curiously the brooch is missing.6 Having in mind the limitations of manuscript illumination, one is inclined to credit the illustrator with the (University of Toronto Press, 1935), Chap. i.

In one instance it may even be that he has caught a joke we have all since missed. He drew the shipman's beard as nothing more than a small drooping 'ounce.' Is it possible that the line so often quoted simply for its picturesqueness, With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake, carries as well the jest that the whiskers of Peter Rysshenden, or whoever he was, looked as wispy as if the North Sea gales had blown most of them away?7 Fifteenth century allusions tend, it is true, to present a sol emn Chaucer, a learned and moral rhetorician. It is not certain, however, that Lydgate "ascribed most qualities to Chaucer ex cept imagination and humour" (Spurgeon, xciv). When, in the Prologue to his Seige of Thebes, Lydgate spoke of the "crafty writinge of his sawes swete" and his "Sugrid mouthe," he may have been thinking of Chaucer's irony as well as of his polished artistry, and certainly, in the same poem, Lydgate, who was more than Ritson's "drivelling monk," contrives a very fair resurrection of Harry Bailly, including his chaffing humor.8 In his Bycorne and Chichevache, too, he refers appreciatively to the Wife of Bath and makes good use of the ironical envoy to the Clerk's Tale. Like Lydgate was the author of the Tale of Beryn; scarcely a humorist in his own right, he yet missed few of the subtleties of comic characterization in the General Prologue.9 Among the Scottish Chaucerians, Dunbar was certainly in fluenced by the robust humor of the Wife of Bath, and Henry son, however heavily he approached the story of Criseyde, never theless owed something to the anthropomorphic laughter of the Nun's Priest's Tale for his Fables and, as Miss Eleanor Hammond has phrased it, generally reflected a "quiet amused penetration" which took "something of its form and pressure from Chaucer."10 ''Ibid. n, 147; CT, i, 406, F.

A great many, perhaps most, of the nota bene's, and other marks of emphasis occur opposite the witty proverbs of Pandarus or the Wife of Bath, and a number are plainly there to call attention to ironies, as when the friar in the Summoner's Tale protests But that I nolde no beest for me were deed.12 For the sixteenth century Miss Spurgeon herself presented suffi cient examples to contradict her own conclusions. Hawes de tected that, however moral Chaucer might be, he often taught through satire "for he was expert / In eloquent terms subtyll and couert," and Hawes distinguished between sententious tales and those which were simply "glade and mery."13 Even the tough Skelton delighted in such a nice touch as Thopas' 'semely nose' and borrowed it to affix to a flyting rival.14 That the satires of Douglas and Lyndesay, for all their crudeness, are still in part entertaining is a testimony to the pervasive influence of Chau cer's humor. The author of The Pilgryms Tale {ante 1540) quotes with obvious relish one of the Wife of Bath's most disarming ironies, the opening lines of her story.15 And all this is a genera tion before the first recognition, according to Miss Spurgeon, of anything even "pleasant, lively, amusing" in Chaucer (I: xcvi). 11 See Robinson, p. 971b. 12 There is a mark opposite this line (CT: in: 1842), in old ink, in a Rylands copy, 13880, of Speght's ed. of Chaucer (Islip, 1598), fol. 41. The marginalia are ascribed to Wm. Trone. Especially interesting for its marginalia is a B. M. copy of Wm. Thynne's ed. (1532), with a MS date 1540, in the same hand, on the title-page (B.M. 644.m.2).

Recounting the story that Chaucer lived in France dur ing the last years of Richard's reign, Leland remarked: turn praeterea eadem opera omnes veneres, lepores, delicias sales, ac postremo gratias linguae Gallicae tarn alte coimbibisse, quam cuiquam vix credible.16 Two hundred years before Warton, at least one critic spoke of Chaucer's wit in terms of delicacy, lightsome saltiness, and l'es prit de gaulois. From the Elizabethans Miss Spurgeon withheld any deeper understanding of Chaucer's temperament than that he was 'lively' and 'amusing.' Actually many of them delighted not only in recalling Chaucerian examples of what Puttenham called "the dry mock"17 but also in analyzing the essentially ironic flavor of Chaucer's mature work. They thought of him as 'a right VVicleu ian,' it is true (and so should we if we believed he had written "The Plowman's Tale"), but as a Wiclifite who, like Erasmus, was compelled by the times to conceal his criticism in disarming pleasantries and cautious ambiguities. Foxe is typical: vnder shadowes couertly, as vnder a visoure, he suborneth truth, in such sorte, as both priuely she may profite the godly-minded, and yet not be espyed of the craftye aduersarie: And therefore the Byshops, belike, takyng hys workes but for iestes and toyes, in condemnying other bookes, yet permitted his bookes to be read.18 Reginald Scot, similarly, describes Chaucer as, in the opening of 18 Commentarii de Scriptor?bus Britannicis {c. 1545), first prtd. in Hall's ed.

For such was his bolde spyrit, that what enormities he saw in any he would not spare to pay them home, eyther in playne words, or els in some prety and pleasant couert, that the simplest might espy him.20 We today would be more inclined to apply such a description to Swift than to Chaucer, but Webbe's insistence that Chaucer's ironic method had a critical motive is implicit in much recent criticism21 and has quite as much textual and historical evidence to support it as the popular Victorian interpretation of Chau cer's irony as the reflection of a philosophic aloofness. It is partly because the latter view tends to persist as a tradition that the Elizabethan critics have been slighted. We are likewise unduly patronizing towards the seventeenth century commentators. It is not true that they did not recognize the 'lightness and delicacy' of Chaucer's humor.22 Though Chau cer is now, said Edward Phillips in 1675, to many simply "not unpleasing for his facetious way, which joyn'd with his old English intertains them with a kind of Drollery," yet he is still "by some few admir'd for his real worth."23 And there were many more in the century than Phillips probably knew of, who laughed with Chaucer rather than at him and continued to de 19 Discouerie of Witchcraft (London, Brome, 1584), bk. 4, ch. 12, p. 88.

Just before the cen tury's beginning Speght had written : In the Tales is shewed the state of the Church, the Court, and Countrey; with such Art and cunning, that although none could denie himselfe to be touched, yet none durst complaine that he was wronged.24 In his 1602 edition Speght introduced marginal 'hands' pointing to specific 'touches' as well as to proverbs admired by the times.25 John Davies, in his Microcosmos, similarly spoke of Chaucer as loving "to lest ... in earnest,"26 and Thomas Fuller conceives of him as so tickling Religious-Orders with his tales, and yet so pinching them with his truths, that Friers in reading his books, know not how to dispose their faces be twixt crying and laughing.27 In a "Histori?la de nostro Chaucero" written probably as early as 1687 but first published in the 1740 edition of Cave's Scrip torum Ecclesiasticorum Historia Litteraria, Henry Warton (one of the really learned scholars of the Restoration) said of Chaucer that primus enim omnium Linguae nostrati sordes exussit, nitorem intulit, &amp; larga vocum molliorum aliund? invectarum supellectile ditavit. . .

A typical example is his suggestion that Chaucer, in picturing the leisurely toilet of Nicholas, "glaunceth wittily at the delicacy or effeminate privacy of this Scholer," and Brathwait draws a moral which, if pat for the Protestants, might yet have been present in Chaucer's mind: (By inference he) glanceth at the pride of the Clergy . . .

It is true that here and elsewhere Dryden left a memorable testi mony to Chaucer's healthy vigor and breadth of vision (finding in Chaucer many of the qualities which Professor Patch feels to be characteristic of his humor) ; it is also true that in sensitivity to the characteristic irony of Chaucer, as to his melody and his tenderness, Dryden was singularly behind his own and Eliza bethan times. It was Dryden, certainly, who said of Chaucer that "As he knew what to say, so he knows also when to leave off," but it was also Dryden who, a few pages later, added that "Sometimes ... he runs riot, like Ovid, and knows not when he has said enough."40 Dryden could not have been Dryden without being a lover of irony, of "fine Raillery . . . the nicest and most delicate touches of satire": How easie it is to call Rogue and Villain, and that wittily? But how hard to make a Man appear a Fool, a Blockhead, or a Knave without using any of those op probrious terms? To spare the grossness of the Names, and to do the thing yet more severely, is to draw a full Face, and to make the Nose and Cheeks stand out, and yet not to employ any depths of shadowing.41 But these remarks were not made apropos of Chaucer, or even of the Romans (though they appeared in his dedication to the Juvenal translations) but in flattery of the lordly nonentity whose patronage he sought. "This [Raillery], my Lord, is your particular Talent, to which even Juvenal could not arrive." When Dryden sought a classical affinity for Chaucer he found him not in Horace, who "barely grins . . . and, as Scaliger says, only shews his white teeth," but in the rough pioneer, Ennius, 39 Spurgeon, introduction xxxvii; cp.

The Troilus, for example, is pri marily "a Satyr on the Inconstancy of Women,"43 and the fab liaux are simply "gross ribaldry." This insensibility naturally interfered with the accuracy of his modernizations. Thomas War ton pointed out how Dryden entirely misrepresented an image in the "Knight's Tale" and "turned it to a satire on the church."

What has not been sufficiently stressed is that a far broader appreciation of Chaucer's humor appeared in the biographical preface to the Urry edition of 1721. Written by John Dart, another antiquarian curate, it is dismissed by the Dictionary of National Biography as a "ridiculous memoir," and, in part it is; yet in respect to Chaucer's humor, Dart fused the best judgment of his own time, that Chaucer was "a pleasant Wit" who wrote with "gay humour" and "gallantry," with the Elizabethan interpretation of him as a subtle and cautious satir ist. "He was a true Master of Satyr . . . not incapable of writing in the Horation way . . . , " but The Persons levelled against, and the Crimes exposed, would not allow of the severe Scourge Juvenal made use of, nor was there such a variety of Follies as Horace facetiously exploded: Not but that Chaucer had a Scene of Vice in the Court of that time, capable of supplying him with matter sufficient for the sharpest strokes of Satyr: but he was wise enough not to exasperate a Court by which he was supported, and in which he had interest little enough to skreen himself from malice without provoking it.49 After Urry's edition there is a steady growth in appreciation of Chaucer's "archness,"60 his "quaint Festivity,"61 and the "cunning hand"62 of his satire. Addison, it is true, cannot be said 47 See Richmond P.

Like Dryden, of course, his modernizations were pat ronizing in spirit, and in general blunted the delicacies of Chau cer's humor but, at least, the selections he "polished" were chosen to display the very finest examples of Chaucer's satiric art. Though his "January and May"played havoc with the ironic framework of the "Merchant's Tale," it is a remarkable example of Pope's precocious juvenilia in its recreation of this, the most sardonic and 'contrived' of Chaucer's works. In the course of his rendition, too, Pope can often be seen carefully preserving some of Chaucer's most characteristic and adroit turns of phrase.63 Later (1714), he made a free and fluent adaptation of the third book of the "House of Fame," to which he had been attracted by Chaucer's neat allegory of the ironies of Fame's rewards. His "Wife of Bath's Prologue," however, failed to catch some of the nicer ambiguities,64 and Dame Allison is "transmogrified" into a mere flippant apologist for her sex. Pope retained an inter est in Chaucer throughout his life, and on his deathbed, in one of his last letters, he could still make a spontaneous and amusing adaptation of an apparent whimsy in the "Knight's Tale."66 Further evidence of neo-classical interest in Chaucer's humor could be drawn from the several other modernizations of the time, and the translations of the latter into French after the mid century. Here there is space only to mention a contributor to the 1741 Tales of Chaucer modernized by several hands, George Ogle. Himself a translator and imitator of Horace, he boldly ranked 53 See Pope, Works, ed. Elwin-Courthope, i: 125, esp. lines 57-58 (cp.

Austin Warren, ibid., 226, feels that "we would hardly, today, think it in the best taste to paraphrase lines from the Knight's Tale for humorous purpose"?a remark which reveals a pro found ignorance both of the tone of the "Knight's Tale" and of good taste in dying.

Later, in his History of English Poetry, he ranges more widely, though even his appreciative analysis of Sir Tho pas and his comparison of its spirit to that of Don Quixote, was an extension of what Bishop Hurd had already written: I call it a manifest banter ... so managed as with infinite humour to expose the leading impertinences of chivalry, and their impertinencies only.69 Thomas Warton's very real claim to respect as a Chaucer critic does not lie in his discovery of Chaucer's humor, for that had never been undiscovered, but in his application of the 56 See his "Letter to a Friend," prefixed to his Gualtherus and Griselda (London, Dodsley, 1739), ix. First French appreciations of Chaucer's satire ap peared in the Journal ?tranger (1755). In the May number a portion of the PardT was translated to exhibit Chaucer's Gallic wit. Most French translations of the period (including Voltaire's) drew from Dryden not Chaucer but at least intro duced such characters as the Wife of Bath. See A. C.

By quotations from Wiclif and from priory records, for example, he uncovered hitherto unguessed nuances in the Monk's portrait, and by parallels from Lang land he made clear not only the stock medieval satire of friars but the "new strokes of humour" which Chaucer had added.60 His superior knowledge of medieval literature made him a pio neer in perceiving the nice balance Chaucer seems to have main tained between imitation and parody, as of the medieval rheto ricians and romancers and pedants, and the curious "mixture of sublime and comic ideas" in Chaucer's Italianate stories.61 There remains to be instanced, for those who assume that we moderns rescued Chaucer's ambiguities from oblivion, Thomas Tyrwhitt's edition of the Canterbury Tales (1775). This is a work which deserves to rank with the labors of Child among the products of pre-romantic antiquarianism. Here it is only per tinent to recall that Tyrwhitt, both in preface and in notes, re garded Chaucer's genius as essentially one of comedy (observing that Chaucer followed his sources much more closely in the seri ous tales), and that he confirmed and multiplied by independent research many of the "flings" and "ridicules" suspected by Warton. He was especially responsive to the dramatic subtleties of the Links in the Canterbury Tales, and was the first critic, so far as I know, to apply the favorite modern word "irony" to a Chaucer passage.62 It must be admitted that there is one notable difference be tween pre-nineteenth century interpretation of Chaucer's humor 60 Warton, ibid., 445-46n, 164-65n, 278; see CT: i: 167, 203, ra: 2099 ff. 61 E.g., ibid., 333-34 (CT: i: 2197-2205, n: 701-07, v: 63 ff.), 360 (CT: i: 1177, 1261, 1995-2050, 2519, 2760), 367 (general comment on KT), 395 (HF: ra), 420 (CT: vn: 2923 ff), 423 (MillT), 426 (CT: i: 3233 ff.), 433 (Thop), 435 (CTPr), 436 (Prioress), 443 (Physician), 445 (Summoner), 452 [misnum bered 451] (Lawyer). 62 (London, Payne, 1775), in: 284r-85, note to 'trag?die,' CT: vu: 2783: "the Host quotes the fine-sounding word with some irony"; see also Tyrwhitt, iii: 276, where an emendation of CT: in: 1932 is rightly rejected for the original, which "may stand, if it be understood ironically."

Hunt, who began to formulate his opinions of Chaucer in a preface to his "Story of Rimini" in 1816,63 tacitly abandoned the view that Chaucer's irony was a protective coloring for social and religious satire and substituted the belief that Chaucer was essentially non-partisan, laughing because tolerant, "tranquil," given by nature to "fair play" and "bonhomie."64 In a later paper I hope to show that Hunt's views, which came to dominate Victorian criticism and much still of ours, were not based on a widening knowledge of Chaucer and his times but were primarily a reflec tion of German romantic criticism, and in particular of the cult of Romantische Ironie. Here there is only space to remark that, when we consider the evidence which Manly and many others65 have uncovered to show the sharp topical satire under neath so many of Chaucer's apparently casual details, we should not be quick to assume that the Elizabethans understood their Chaucer less than did the Victorians. It would be blind to deny, of course, that there is in Chaucer also "insight, sympathy and tender seriousness, all brought into play upon the ever-present sense of the incongruous" but it is easy also to trace the recognition of this "deeper and more deli cate quality alone deserving the name of 'humour' "66 in the comments from Leland down. The earlier critics differed only in feeling that Chaucer could be tough as well as "tender." They did not suffer the Victorian compulsion to picture Chaucer as "a second Shakespeare ... a Human Catholic . . . who never adds his voice to the mere party cries of his day, whose sound taste shrank from every form of caricature."67 It was not entirely un fair of Lounsbury and Miss Spurgeon to say that the Elizabe thans found morality in Chaucer, and the seventeenth century 63 Not 1846, as Miss Spurgeon wrote in the passage quoted by Patch, supra; see Hunt, pref. to "The Story of Rimini," Poetical Works, 3rd ed.

What is certain is that the essential irony of Chaucer, the "subtle, shifting, delicate and all-pervading humour" which was ^"dis tinguishing quality of (his) mind,"68 was, far from being unrec ognized, never forgotten.
