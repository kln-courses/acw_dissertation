<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE QUMRAN COVENANTERS AND THE LATER JEWISH SECTS NORMAN GOLB* I. DID THE EARLY KARAITES WRITE THE SCROLLS? T HE study of the Hebrew manu- scripts from Wadi Qumran con- tinues unabated. Not only have the seven scrolls in the possession of the Hebrew University been edited and commented upon in numerous Euro- pean, Israeli, and American publica- tions; a goodly number of fragments gleaned from the Qumran caves and the surrounding area have also been published either in the journals or in book form. Beyond that, the initial spate of hasty writing that accompa- nied the first publications of the texts over a decade ago has given way to se- rious and extensive researches on such topics as the sectarian orientation of the Qumran Covenanters and the the- ology implicit in their writings-some- thing for which we have especially to thank Continental scholars. It may happen, of course, that the place of these manuscripts in the historical scheme of things will never be deter- mined with precision; but the indica- tions are that, with the benefits of time and possible further discoveries, the confused polemics that have ensued with regard to the scrolls as a result of our actual dearth of knowledge about some early periods in Jewish history shall at all events be replaced by calm debate, and the more extreme views about the age and origin of these sec- tarians, and about their writings, will be discarded. Probably the best known of these latter are (a) the contention that the scrolls are forgeries and (b) that they were written by medieval sectarian Jews. The forgery hypothesis seems in- credible today, but in 1948 there were more than a few who believed it. Had not other attempts at forgery been made in the nineteenth century? Had not many scholars been duped by fake discoveries? Could not the scrolls have been brought to the caves from Cairo or elsewhere and deposited there by Bedouins anxious to make a quick profit? As the wider exploration of the Qum- ran area began to result in further dis- coveries and as the serious analysis of the documents themselves continued to support the claim of authenticity, the vehemence of this first contention abated; the proposal that the manu- scripts were hoaxes or worthless scraps of parchment was ameliorated by the claim that they were worthless for the history of the Second Jewish Common- * Norman Golb is assistant professor of medie- val Jewish studies at Hebrew Union College-Jew- ish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati, Ohio.

At this point the Qumran documents became a subject of study not only for biblical scholars and historians of the Hellenistic world but for medievalists as well. If the scrolls were medieval as contended, their place in the literature of that period would have to be as- sessed. If they were written by Karaite schismatics, then our understanding of the origins of that sectarian movement was in need of considerable revision. It had been generally thought that Karaism, a sectarian movement which in the course of its history provided rabbinic Judaism with some severe challenges, had begun as a series of un- related schismatic movements in early Islamic Babylonia and Persia. Enough evidence was available in the medieval sources to show that, around the begin- ning of the eighth century, such charis- matic personalities as Abu Isa of Ispa- han and Yudghan, "the Shepherd," had succeeded in attracting large numbers of Persian Jews; and that, a short time later, the Baghdad Jew, Anan ben Da- vid, author of the first known antirab- binic code of law (ca. 760) had in the exilarchic center itself been able to en- tice some of his brethren away from the dominant religious authority. Other such heretical leaders arose in Iraq and Iran during the following years; spurred on by the battle cry ascribed to Anan: "Search ye well in the Torah, and do not rely on my opinion," these figures founded sects and parties of their own; then, as the opposition on the part of rabbinic Judaism increased and as the principle of return to the scriptural law became more widespread among the sects, they began to draw together, and by the tenth century they came to be generally known as "Ka- raites"-scriptural Jews-regardless of their former allegiances.' By this time, to be sure, there were important settlements of Karaites in Palestine; a migration to that land of Karaitic "mourners for Zion" had been going on ever since the days of Daniel al-Kumisi (middle of the ninth cen- tury). However, the persistent claim that the Qumran Covenanters consti- tuted an early Karaitic sect, of which no records had been preserved in the medieval sources, implied that Karaism had had a foothold in Palestine-where the manuscripts were found-at a much earlier period, perhaps the sev- enth or the eighth century; further, it implied that the Karaites had produced at that early period hymns like those found in the Thanksgiving Scroll, de- scriptions of apocalyptic warfare such as are recorded in the Scroll of Battle, and a theology containing the strong dualistic beliefs expressed in the Man- ual of Discipline. Could our whole con- ception, then, of the birth and devel- opment of Karaism have been errone- ous? The philological analysis of the Qum- ran documents produced several posi- tive results with regard to the clarifica- tion of this problem. Certain Qumran terms and expressions had been uti- lized extensively, so it turned out, by various early Karaites. A number of laws and interpretations of biblical pre- cepts were common to both sects. Sev- eral early Karaite biblical commenta- tors had employed a type of exegesis closely approximating that used by the Covenanters.2 On the basis of these findings, a few writers were willing to support the</page><page sequence="3">40 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION claim that the scrolls were indeed me- dieval, but others were far less ready to admit the validity of this inference. Time and again the point was made that the presence in certain documents of concepts and phrases found also in other documents did not indicate that all of them were of the same general age. And the contention seemed doubly uncertain in this case. Our knowledge of the history of Byzantine and early Islamic Palestine could hardly leave us free to think that a Qumran-like schism was developing in that country in the seventh or the eighth century and that the historical allusions in such Qumran documents as the Habakkuk Commen- tary were to events of those times; nor was it likely that in this age schismatic Jews still possessed biblical texts writ- ten in the ancient Canaanite script-- such as were found at Qumran. But even without this there were numerous differences between the Qumran docu- ments and the Karaitic literature. The study of the early Karaitic writings, whether in manuscript or in printed form (see n. 18), made it evident that these sectarians, unlike the Qumran Covenanters, had never advocated a closely knit monastic order with initia- tion by stages into such an order. No espousal of the Light-Darkness theol- ogy, no juxtaposition of the Spirits of Truth and Perversity, was discernible in medieval Jewish sectarian literature. Furthermore, the Karaites had never indorsed the observance of baptismal rituals as a means of purification from sin; they were silent about mysteries of God causing amazement among the people, about bodies of doctrine that could be revealed only to the initiated. Indeed, the literary and religious char- acter of the Qumran documents proved to be so widely different from that of the early Karaitic texts known to us that the identification of the Covenant- ers with these later sectarians became virtually unthinkable on this score alone. And, at the same time, writers were showing the close proximity of the Qumran beliefs to concepts which dom- inated the religious life and thought of a variety of sects during the late Hel- lenistic period. The Covenanters un- doubtedly had certain affinities with the Judeo-Christian Ebionites, and with other baptizing sects; and the resem- blances between them and the Essenes were especially noteworthy. They might not have been precisely the Essenes as described by Josephus or Philo; but they could, concluded the great major- ity of scholars-and this on the basis of firm evidence-at all events be clas- sified as a kind of sect closely related to the Essenes, or, in other words, a type of Essenic order.3 II. THE "SADUKIYA" AND THE " MAGHARIYA" But the connection of the Qumran sect to the Karaites continued to baffle scholars. If the scrolls were indeed an- cient documents, then by what proc- ess, if any, had they become known to the early Karaites? How did it happen that characteristic Qumran ideas re- appeared in the writings of Anan ben David, Daniel al-Kumisi, and other medieval sectarian leaders? The obvi- ous answer, and the one which most writers accepted and continue to ac- cept, was that certain early Karaites had discovered some of the Qumran writings and had utilized them in the development of their own doctrinal systems.4 In the following discussion we should like to examine this theory more close- ly, to indicate what constitute the main</page><page sequence="4">QUMRAN COVENANTERS AND LATER JEWISH SECTS 41 difficulties with regard to it, and to of- fer an alternate solution for the riddle based on our knowledge of historical circumstances during the first several centuries of the post-Christian period. It must be said at the outset that an- cient non-canonical writings (witness the case of the Hebrew Ben Sira) were un- doubtedly in the possession of the Arabic-speaking Jews in the Middle Ages. The fact is indicated in a general way by one tenth-century Karaite, Sahl ben Masliah; while he and another writer also explicitly state that books of the "Sadukiya"-by which they mean the Sadducees-were well known in their time. Saadiah Gaon (892?- 942) may have been acquainted with some of the "Sadukiya" writings; the learned historiographer of early Kara- ism, Jacob al-Kirkisani (ca. 940), even described a number of their be- liefs and doctrines." When the famous Zadokite Docu- ment-whose connection with the Qumran writings has been demon- strated in a most convincing way-was first published in 1910, it was proposed by the editor that this manuscript fur- nished us with a genuine remnant of the sectarian "Sadukiya" literature (see n. 5). The demonstrations of this hypothesis on the basis of Kirkisani's description of the doctrines of these sectarians were not universally ac- cepted-they could not really stand up under close scrutiny. However, in 1947 came the discovery of the first Qumran documents in a cave approximately a score of miles from Jericho, and there- after writers no longer even stood in need of the specific "Sadukiya" refer- ences in order to demonstrate the wide diffusion of such texts as these in the Middle Ages. For there are indeed some statements in the medieval litera- ture about the discovery during the eighth or the ninth century of ancient Hebrew manuscripts. The story related by Timotheus I, Patriarch of Seleucia, is by now especially well known to fol- lowers of the Qumran affair: In or around the year 800, he had learned from Jews being instructed in the rudi- ments of Christianity that some He- brew manuscripts had been found ten years previously in a "rock-dwelling near Jericho." An Arab's dog, while in pursuit of game, had gone into a cave and had failed to come out again; and "its owner went in after it and found a chamber in which there were many books.... The hunter went off to Jeru- salem and told his story to the Jews, who came out in great numbers and found books of the Old Testament and others in the Hebrew script."6 Immediately after attention was called to the letter of Timotheus, writ- ers began to assume that the cave "near Jericho" and the cave in which the first Qumran manuscripts were found were, if not one and the same, at least closely related geographically; from this they went on to claim that the contents of each must likewise have some literary or historical connection and that the sectarian writings circulating among the Jews in the Middle Ages were in reality Qumran texts discovered at the close of the eighth century. For this inference, of course, no actual internal evidence could be cited; but the fact is that there are many caves in the great- er vicinity of Jericho, and a number of these have in the past several years given up manuscript treasures that are in no way related to those found at Qumran-so that in reality there could not be found a shred of evidence here to connect these manuscripts spoken of</page><page sequence="5">42 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION by Timotheus with the sectarian litera- ture discovered at Qumran. At the same time, this hypothesis seemed to be supported by some state- ments in the writings of medieval au- thorities on heresies and schisms, such as Kirkisani and the Muslims al-Bi- runi (973-1048) and al-Shahrastani (1076-1153), relative to a sect called the "Maghariya"-so named, Kirkisani tells us, because their books had been obtained in a cave (Arabic maghar). Since the books of these sectarians, like those of the Qumran Covenanters, had been found in a cave, some writers reasoned that the two sects must be the same, and that the "Qumran-Magha- riya" documents had been first alluded to by Timotheus at the very beginning of the nineteenth century. The iden- tification of the Maghariya with the Qumran sect seemed to be reinforced by the fact that Biruni had stated that the Maghariya observed a calendar accord- ing to which the New Year always oc- cured on a Wednesday-for this was also apparently the case with the Book of Jubilees, a work which seems to have been known and used by the Qumran Covenanters.7 Furthermore, Kirkisani writes that a man he calls only by the name "the Alexandrian" was one of the members of the Magharian sect and that his book was "famous and the best of the books of the Maghariya;" now about sixty years ago it had been pro- posed that "the Alexandrian" was Philo; and Philo had evinced a most sym- pathetic attitude toward the Essenes, whom most writers today identify with the Qumran Covenanters-so that the claim could even be made that it was quite in order for an Essenic library to contain copies of Philo's books, and thus that it was quite in order for Kir- kisani to associate "the Alexandrian" with that one sect which was apparently identical with the Qumran Covenanters. Following upon this series of hypoth- eses came the inevitable proposal that the documents ostensibly discovered in Palestine at the beginning of the ninth century had reached the hands of certain Karaites, notably Benjamin of Nihawend (in Persia!)-who, like the Magharians, believed that an angel had created the world-and thus en- abled this latter figure "to set up Karaite theology and philosophy on quite a new basis so that he became generally regarded as the . .second founder of the Karaites."8 III. THE MAGHARIYA THEORY RECONSIDERED Does the evidence at hand, then, ac- tually support the hypothesis that the Qumran Covenanters were identified with the so-called Maghariya in the Middle Ages and that the latter influ- enced the Karaites? Our sources (the texts are translated by de Vaux, see n. 7) do not agree on the doctrines and observances of this obscure sect, or even on its exact name-if indeed only one sect is meant. Concerning the name, only in Kirkisani do we find "Ma- ghariya"; the others have "Maqariba," "Maghariba," or similar spellings. Kir- kisani himself attempts to explain the name "Maghariya" by saying that "they were only called thus because their books were obtained in a cave"-but no explanation at all is offered either by Biruni or Shahrastani. Kirkisani and Shahrastani agree that the Maghariya believed that all anthropomorphic pas- sages in the Bible were to be referred to an angel rather than to God himself- but only Kirkisani states that they held that this angel, rather than God, cre- ated the world. In the matter of calendri-</page><page sequence="6">QUMRAN COVENANTERS AND LATER JEWISH SECTS 43 cal practice, where Shahrastani is en- tirely silent, Biruni and Kirkisani di- verge: According to Kirkisani's express statement, the Magharian view was that the first month of creation began on a Wednesday, when the luminaries were created, and all subsequent months be- gin "when the moon is full," that is, any day in the week; but Biruni says that the "Maghariba contend that the feasts are not legal unless the moon rises full the night following Tuesday ... from which point the days and months are computed ... and they also disallow the Passover unless it falls upon a Wednes- day [i.e., Tuesday night]."9 There are several other divergences. Neither Biruni nor Shahrastani knows of Kirkisani's claim that a group of the Maghariya considered it unseemly to laugh. Only Kirkisani mentions a Ma- gharian book known as the Sefer Yadoca, or a book of "the Alexandrian," and only he finds it possible to say that their other books are filled with nonsensical statements. Shahrastani alone states that this "Maqariba" lived "four hundred years before Arius." The sources underlying these de- scriptions are manifestly divergent. But even if we assume that Kirkisani alone is entirely reliable in his presentation of the Maghariya, there is nothing in their doctrines as described by him which may lead us to believe that he or his source had Qumran documents at hand when describing this sect. Only on one point of doctrine do Kirkisani's Ma- ghariya and the Qumran sectarians agree --both disapprove of laughter; but such a prohibition was not uncommon among the sects and philosophical circles of antiquity. We have yet to discover a demiurge in the Qumran texts; the Qumranians did not interpret biblical passages containing anthropomorphisms as referring to an angel-creator rather than to God himself; it is hardly likely that a tenth-century author would speak of the type of exegesis prevalent in the Habakkuk Commentary as "foolish, nonsensical statements"; assuming that Kirkisani meant Philo in referring to "the Alexandrian," there is nothing re- motely approaching Philo's philosophi- cal or exegetical system in the Qumran finds, and no mention of Alexandria or an Alexandrian anywhere; and it is un- likely that the calendrical system of Kirkisani's Mhaghariya was the same as that of the Qumran Covenanters. But we are in no better a position with regard to the hypothesis that Qumran (equals [sic!] Maghariya) documents influenced the Karaites. The fact that Benjamin of Nihawend accepted the doctrine of the demiurge, at least in one of its forms, cannot at all convince us that he borrowed this doctrine from newly discovered Magharian writings. This doctrine, which was very popular in Hellenistic times, greatly influenced the gnostic sects of the early Middle Ages; and all we are entitled to say is that Benjamin, along with many other sectarians, adhered to this belief. In the other few scraps of evidence that we possess about the Maghariya, we fail to see any relationship whatsoever be- tween them and Benjamin or his fol- lowers. Benjamin's calendrical views differed considerably from those of the Maghariya; nor did he disapprove of laughter. We are quite well acquainted with the doctrines of the Benjaminites and their leader; yet nowhere do we find a shred of evidence that would lead us to suspect that they had discovered the lost writings of the Maghariya and uti- lized them for their own purposes.1x In short, the Qumran-Maghariya- Karaite hypothesis collapses upon any</page><page sequence="7">44 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION close examination of the evidence. But this only means that the relationship between the Covenanters and the Kara- ites must be explained in another way. IV. LITERARY INFLUENCE? If it could be demonstrated that the legal doctrines of the Qumran Cove- nanters reappeared among the Karaites only in the ninth century and beyond, we might perhaps find it possible to be- lieve, without even reverting to the Ma- ghariya hypothesis, that Qumran docu- ments discovered in Palestine at the be- ginning of that century (such, perhaps, as the Zadokite Document) had strong- ly influenced the Karaites. Even this theory would be embarassed by the con- sideration that the early ninth-century Karaites known to us come from Persia; and we would perhaps have to suppose that these documents had in some man- ner made their way from Palestine to Persia (or at least Babylonia), where they were eagerly read by discontented schismatics-unless of course, we were to claim, as a few writers indeed do, that the documents had been discovered by Karaites immigrating to Palestine from other lands. But the fact is that there are similarities between the earli- est Karaism, that of Anan ben David and his immediate predecessors and fol- lowers, and the Qumran sectarianism. Furthermore, upon careful reading, the earliest Karaite codes betray the inter- esting fact that Qumran legal precepts and doctrines occur in them only spo- radically. One Qumran dietary law, for example, reappears only in Anan's code; another, only in that of Daniel al- Kumisi; a few of Anan's civil and sacri- ficial laws are like those of Qumran, yet others are not. It is, in short, impossible to detect in the early Karaitic codes any profound literary influence on the part of the Qumran Covenanters. The hy- pothesis that Qumran documents were circulating among the Palestinian Kara- ites of the ninth and tenth centuries may satisfactorily explain how certain Qumran expressions and concepts worked their way into the Karaite lit- erature of that period; but the exist- ence of legal parallels (for the various similarities, cf. the essays mentioned in n. 2) going back as far as the beginning of the eighth century makes it clear that, in essence, the relationship is of a pro- founder sort. It is a historical relation- ship, not merely a literary one. And we possess sufficient evidence to reconstruct the process which gave rise to it. Long before the discovery of the Qumran literature, Abraham Geiger had formulated the theory that the Karaites were descended from the ancient Sad- ducees. In his attempt to demonstrate this view, Geiger adduced several par- allels between Sadducean and Karaite laws; he also pointed out that a number of medieval writers identified the Kara- ites with the Sadducees and even called them by that name. But it could be shown that the term "Sadducee" (He- brew seduki) lost its particular sectarian connotation during the Talmudic period and came to be employed during the early Middle Ages as a generic term for various kinds of schismatics, not only for the historical Sadducees. Later writers, furthermore, were able to point out that almost none of the legal par- allels were valid; in the few cases where they seemed to be so, the "Sadducean" laws in question were in reality the laws of a related sect, the Boethusians, whose doctrines in the early rabbinic literature are always kept distinct from those of the Sadducees, and whose intrinsic con-</page><page sequence="8">QUMRAN COVENANTERS AND LATER JEWISH SECTS 45 nection with these latter has been doubted by some scholars since the six- teenth century." Geiger's hypothesis could simply not be supported by the evidence at hand. However, had he-and subsequent scholars of that period-possessed the Qumran scrolls, their views may have been somewhat differently expressed: In the numerous legal parallels between the Covenanters and the early Karaites, they would have perceived a relation- ship of a far more intimate kind than could be conceivable between those Karaites and the historical Sadducees, who even in their basic denial of the afterlife were opposed to the general Karaitic view. Even before the discovery of the Qumran manuscripts, some writers had noticed points of contact be- tween the laws of Anan ben David and the practices of the Essenes as described by Josephus. But the scrolls themselves furnished abundant evidence for the fact that these sectarians were in good meas- ure the spiritual forebears of the early Karaites of Babylonia and Persia and that it was from them that those Kara- ites derived many of their legal and doc- trinal views. V. ESSENES, ELCHASAITES, MANDAEANS For those who are of the belief that the Essenes disappeared from history when Qumran fell, perhaps only the theory of literary influence will account for the existence of Qumran-like doc- trines among the Karaites of the eighth and ninth centuries. But were these Essenic sectarians then massacred, or did they suddenly assimilate? Indeed, that such a view can be proposed in the face of the abundant evidence to the contrary is baffling in the extreme. To do this we should simply have to discard as worthless or irrelevant all the state- ments in the early heresiographic litera- ture pointing to the existence of Essenic and other sectarian Jewish communities after the destruction of the Second Jew- ish Commonwealth. It is true that in their descriptions of the Essenes, the heresiographers lean heavily upon Jose- phus and Philo. But their additional in- timations of the existence of the sect after the time of Philo and Josephus, and after the destruction of the Second Commonwealth, are more than just hearsay. The Essenes are mentioned as still thriving in a community near the Dead Sea by Dio Chrysostom (end of the first century) and are briefly re- ferred to by Hegesippus. We have quite a full account of them in the Philoso- phumena of Hippolytus. This author, to be sure, does utilize an earlier source; but Epiphanius, in his Panarion, reports what he himself learned during his lengthy sojourn in Palestine (before the year 367). Epiphanius seems to distin- guish between Samaritan "Essenoi" and Jewish "Ossaioi," and it may be that by his own time the surviving Essenes had branched off into a few subsects; at all events, various writers have shown that there must be a close connection be- tween the "Ossaioi" and the earlier Es- senes.12 From Epiphanius we learn not only that the Ossaioi during the third and fourth centuries amalgamated with a sect know as the "Sampsaeans" (a name probably to be explained as "those showing homage to the sun"), so that they became a single group going by one or the other of these titles; but, further- more, that both of these groups, as well as the Ebionites and Nazareans, in the process of mingling with one another in the land territories beyond the Jordan</page><page sequence="9">46 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION and the Dead Sea, came under the influ- ence of the followers of a man known as Elchasai, who had flourished toward the end of the first Christian century.'3 This figure, who preached a new revelation, had enjoined his followers to practice baptism through total immersion of the clothed body in a river or spring; he had insisted upon the rite of circumcision and upon the observance of the Sabbath, but he was opposed to sacrificial offer- ings. Now the Essenes also believed in ritual baptism as a means of restoring their spiritual purity; and the oaths that were required of new members of their society are reminiscent of the severe vows in use among the Elchasaites. The Essenic hostility to the Pharisaic order of sacrifice may well have given rise to an "Ossaean" acceptance of the Elcha- saitic ban on sacrifice, and these same Essenic remnants would have been at- tracted to the vegetarianism of the Elchasaites. The amalgamation of the Essenes with the Elchasaites, however, could have been effected only after some concessions from both sides; and, to be sure, it is unlikely that there was ever a complete coalescence of these groups, considering especially the chris- tological tendencies of the Elchasaites and of such related groups as the Ebion- ites and Nazareans. However, we need not infer that these sects ever became a single entity. We may consider that the Ebionites, Nazareans, and Elchasa- ites, having been stigmatized by the church as Judaizing heretics, and hav- ing removed to Transjordania, gradually lost their outstanding christological characteristics; on the other hand, the close relationship of certain Ebionitic doctrines to those of the Essenes, and the messianic expectations which these groups shared, tended to bring them into closer and more intimate contact, so that they began to learn from one an- other and, eventually, to accept some of the doctrines of Elchasai as a meeting ground for their own views. At the same time, they continued to maintain in- dividual practices and beliefs. The heresiographic evidence makes it clear that, although in the course of mingling with other sects of Palestinian origin the true identity of the Essenes was finally lost, the remnants of this order and its doctrines survived at least until Byzantine times. It is therefore not surprising to find evidence of Es- senic influence upon the Mandaeans, a quasi-Judeo-Christian gnostic sect which probably originated in the early post-Christian period and which sur- vives even until the present day in the marshlands of southern Babylonia. Long before the Qumran discoveries, writers were able to call attention to several remarkable parallels between the practices and beliefs of the Man- daeans and those of the earlier Essenes as the latter are described by Josephus. The Mandaean doctrine of the "Ayar Ziwa," the "radiant ether," evidently corresponded, it could be perceived, to the Essenic doctrine of the "most thin air." The reputed celibacy (and possible vegetarianism) of the Essenes could be compared with similar doctrines among the Mandaeans' forefathers. The practice of wearing white ritual gar- ments was shared by these two groups, and both indulged in baptismal rituals. Just as Josephus' Essenes could impart the names of the angels-along with other mysteries-only to the initiated, so also would the Mandaeans consider it sinful to reveal the names of their "Malkia," or semidivinities, to anyone except a fellow sectarian.14</page><page sequence="10">QUMRAN COVENANTERS AND LATER JEWISH SECTS 47 The Qumran manuscripts have fur- nished additional evidence for a rela- tionship between these sects. There are, to be sure, numerous differences be- tween the doctrines of the Covenanters and those of the Mandaeans; the syn- cretistic nature of Mandaeism makes any alternative phenomenon incon- ceivable. The bearing of the Qumran texts upon Mandaeic gnosticism is, at the same time, a separate problem; earlier gnostic doctrines could have reached this sect through a variety of channels, but it cannot be demonstrated that the later Essenism was one of these. With other Mandaeic beliefs, however, we are on firmer ground. We know of express stipulations in the Manual of Discipline regarding the confessions of sin which the candidate had to render before being admitted into the society; in Mandaeic writings such confessions apparently constituted a necessary pre- baptismal rite. In these same writings, the "Mastema" appears as one of the chief demons, as in the Manual; and his power to punish and destroy likewise extends over all mankind. The Cov- enanters, as the later Mandaeans, be- lieved in the doctrine of opposing spirits of good and evil. One belief stands out with special clarity: in a remarkable passage, the author of the Manual pre- scribes that the Levites curse all the men of the lot of Belial with the words, "Cursed be you in all evil deeds. ... Your deeds are like unto the darkness. Be you chastised in the obscure dark- ness of the eternal fire!" (Manual of Discipline, II, 4 ff.). This same con- cept is strongly evident in Mandaeic texts, where the region of these flames is made to be inhabited by Satan and the other demons, the association of darkness and flames eventually bringing about their identification in the minds of the people.'5 The fact is, to be sure, that recent research has tended to favor on entirely independent grounds the Palestinian origin of early Mandaeic doctrine. It seems likely that the forerunners of the Mandaeans lived in the west and, dur- ing the first few centuries of the Chris- tian Era, began migrating toward Baby- lonia; the eastern, non-Jewish elements in Mandaeism entered into the sects's beliefs at a subsequent period of time. More than a hundred years ago writers had pointed out that the Mandaeans once considered a certain "Elchasaich" -i.e., the Elchasai of the heresiographic sources-to be a founder of their sect; and it is indeed possible that some Es- senic doctrines reached Babylonia via the Elchasaites after their departure from Palestine. At all events, we cannot allow ourselves to assume that the in- fluence was only literary, especially in view of the survival of Essenic-Elcha- saitic sects in territories east of the Jor- dan well into the Byzantine-Sassanian period. Mandaeism was the result of the close intermingling of eastern ideas with Palestinian theosophical concep- tions and their concomitant rituals; but the Palestinian elements entered in through the living contact of the Es- senic and Elchasaitic sects, after their migration eastward, with the popula- tions of the Sassanian Empire.'" VI. THE HISTORICAL LINK The causes of the sectarian Jewish migrations eastward are to be sought in the general circumstances of early Sas- sanian and Byzantine times. It is com- mon knowledge that the Jewish popula- tion of Palestine decreased consider- ably as a result of the Hadrianic perse-</page><page sequence="11">48 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION cutions and the discriminatory acts of Constantine, abetted by a process of severe economic deterioration. As con- ditions in Palestine became less and less tolerable, emigration from that country increased, the goals of which were often the lands washed by the Mediterranean, yet much more often the flourishing prov- inces, of the Sassanian Empire; indeed, Babylonia itself could be reached after a journey of only two weeks via the caravan routes that led from Palestine through Palmyra and thence to the Eu- phrates. The emigration of Jewish scholars from Palestine to Babylonia is much attested to in the rabbinic litera- ture. But large numbers of the Pales- tinian Jewish population emigrated along with them; this is evident from the rise of Babylonia as the chief eco- nomic and spiritual center during Tal- mudic times, from the relatively favor- able disposition of the Sassanian mon- archy toward the Jews during many periods of its reign, and from the suit- able geographic conditions-to mention only some of the factors. Accompanied by an influx of Jews from Armenia into such places as Susiana and Ispahan, the Jewish migration from Palestine to Sas- sanian Babylonia probably reached its culmination during the fourth century. The wealth of such "Jewish" cities as Mahoza attests to the stability of the Babylonian Jewish community during this period and to the participation of that community in the general good for- tunes of the Sassanian Empire.IT Historians of the period under dis- cussion have not considered sufficiently the implications of this population shift for the problem of Jewish sectarianism; rather, they have tended to let us as- sume, if only by silence, that the migra- tion eastward was participated in by the adherents to rabbinic Judaism alone. It is hardly possible to think, however, that the surviving Essenes and other Jewish sectarians escaped the dire consequences of the Constantinian decrees, and what is more, of the deteriorating economic conditions in Palestine. They were as much affected by these adverse circum- stances as were their rabbinic brethren, and their means and methods of surviv- al were not greatly different. They too migrated eastward. Epiphanius, as we have seen, located many of these sec- tarian Jews in the territories east of the Jordan; while the rabbinic literature mentions numerous Jewish schismatics, gnostic and otherwise, as settled in Babylonia. Finally, the presence of an- cient sectarian Jewish elements in both Mandaeism and the early Karaism of Babylonia and Persia furnishes direct evidence for the fact that representa- tives of the older Jewish sectarianism of Palestine still survived in various communities of the Sassanian Empire. In the case of Mandaeism, those Jewish groups came into contact with native Babylonian and Iranian religious sects; here the final product was a syncretistic religion whose Jewish elements were stultified and almost drowned out by a mass of pagan beliefs. Early Karaism, however, did not as a rule preserve for- eign elements; the tenets of its various subsects were mainly the result of the blending of both Babylonian Jewish practices and the beliefs of native Jew- ish heretics with earlier sectarian doc- trines originating in Palestine-doctrines which were preached by surviving mem- bers of the Essenic order and related Jewish sects. As these groups began to settle in the cities and provinces of the Sassanian Empire, some of their beliefs</page><page sequence="12">QUMRAN COVENANTERS AND LATER JEWISH SECTS 49 and practices took root among the peo- ple; in this manner they were trans- mitted from generation to generation and eventually reappeared among the emergent Karaitic sects of early Islamic times.'8 NOTES 1.

Jaubert (VT, III [1953], 251 ff.) be- lieves that the various dates and events discussed in the Book of Jubilees form a coherent pattern only if we assume that the author of this book had in mind a calendar wherein the month neces- sarily began on a Tuesday night; and this, she claims, is the same information as we have in Biruni about the Maghariya. Biruni, however, states that this sect observed the new year only when the moon would rise full on the night pre- ceding Wednesday-a peculiar statement indeed. Kirkisani's more intelligible remark is to the effect that the Maghariya necessarily observed only the first Wednesday of creation as the first New Month, while all subsequent New Months began on the night of every subsequent full moon, re- gardless of whether that night was Tuesday or any other night of the week. Therefore, even if it could be demonstrated that the Qumran Covenanters fully and wholeheartedly ac- cepted the calendar of Jubilees, there would still be nothing in all this to identify the Maghariya with the Covenanters. Cf. further my article, "Who Were the Maghariya?" JAOS, Vol. LXXX, No. 4 (1960), for a more thorough discussion of this and other issues pertaining to the identifica- tion of this sect. 10.

I hereby wish to record my thanks to the American Philosophical Society, which through a research award enabled me during the summer of 1959 to examine at firsthand many manuscript works, Karaite and otherwise, contained in the English libraries and thus made it possible for me to formulate my position regarding the Qumran- Karaite problem with far greater precision than would otherwise have been the case.</page></plain_text>
