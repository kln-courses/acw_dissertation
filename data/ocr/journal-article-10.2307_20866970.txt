<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shameless Freedom KariWeil The final scene of J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace has left readers and critics puzzled, angry, or in tears.1 It is a baffling scene where the previously unlikeable protagonist, David Lurie, "gives up" the one dog he has developed a relationship with. That dog, much like Lurie himself, is unwanted and beaten by life, but also a dog who, as Lurie knows, would die for him (215). "Bearing him in his arms like a lamb," Lurie determines the dog's time has come and offers him up to be euthanized. But why? In a review of the novel, Ian Hacking writes of this sacrificial gesture: "I cannot comprehend [it], and only barely feel it as possible" (26). Josephine Donovan admits that Coetzee does come close to aestheticizing evil in this scene, but adds that she has chosen "to interpret the scene within the evident ethical context [she believes] Coetzee intends" and in which his protagonist can "experience a conversion to a heightened state of moral awareness."(93, n.16; 79). In an opposing view, David Attridge warns against reading Lurie's behavior as any kind of conversion to an "ethical response" to animal suffering. "This is not a practical commitment to improving the world, but a profound need to preserve the integrity of the self'(115). Refusing to find any such conversion in Lurie's character, Attridge reads Lurie' s life as consistently living for an idea, an idea that has little to do with the dog. Indeed, what would the dog know of sacrifice we might ask, echoing Lurie's own question of why he has taken on the job of giving the euthanized dogs an honorable cremation. "But the dogs are dead; and what do the dogs know of honour and dishonour anyway??For himself, then. For his idea of the world, a world in which men do not use shovels to beat corpses into a more convenient shape for processing"(Coetzeel46). Like Attridge, Louis Tremaine resists reading jac 30.3-4(2010)</page><page sequence="2">714 jac Lurie's gesture as ethical, but does find that it marks an important change in his character. For the first time, Tremaine suggests, Lurie is able to see the dog in terms of its "own conditions of existence, without imposing his own idea of it... the dog is 'just a dog,' and David is just a human being? body-souls, animals both of them?and he cannot save either of them by rendering them into art" (Tremaine 603). Tremaine thus sees the ending as a beginning for Lurie who, in response to the crippled dog, is finally able to come to terms with the "shame of suffering and of death" which no artistic project can relieve. But why, I would ask, is the dog's death or any death shameful, and is not shame an idea? I thought of this ending of after reading and hearing a paper on "Animal Welfare and the Moral Value of Nonhuman Animals" by Gary Francione, who is Distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers University.2 The major premise of his paper is that the animal welfare position?the position that "it is morally acceptable to use animals as human resources as long as we treat them 'humanely' and do not inflict 'unnecessary suffering' on them"?provides "an insignificant level of protection to nonhuman ani mals" (Francione 1). More specifically, he argues that the welfare position supports the view that "the life of nonhumans has lesser moral value than the life of humans" and thus acts as a justification for using nonhumans as resources or "chattel property." This made some sense and, indeed, is one reason why some municipalities in the U.S. are changing the designation of those who live with companion animals from "pet-owners" to pet or animal "guardians." Francione did not discuss guardianship, however, nor any form of relationship with animals outside of property. Indeed, Francione's ultimate conclusion forecloses any consideration of such relations. Having claimed that there can be no justification for using animals in ways that we would not condone using humans (a familiar argument against speciesism) and that we, nevertheless, continue to turn them into property with interests that are necessarily subservient to the interests of their owners, we should stop producing domestic animals at all. If we took animals seriously and recognized our obligation not to treat them as things, we would stop producing and facilitating the production of domestic animals altogether. We would care for the ones whom we have here now, but we would stop breeding more for human consumption and we would leave non-domesticated ani</page><page sequence="3">Kari Weil 715 mals alone. We would stop eating, wearing, or using animal prod ucts and would regard veganism as a clear and unequivocal moral baseline. (21). As Francione clarified in the discussion following his paper, his conclusion did not mean we should let domestic animals breed themselves. Rather, he declared, we should sterilize all living domestic animals to ensure they would all die out. Only this would stop the slavery. Only this?the extinction of all domestic animals (and he made no distinction between animals for food and animals for companionship)?would be a solution to our wrongs. This, I thought, was the law professor's sacrifice of the animals for his "idea of the world." After hearing the talk I went back to Coetzee's novel to think again about how to read the ending. Previously, I had understood it as Lurie's one and only gesture of love, the proof that he had truly undergone a transformation during the novel, and had come to a realization of his abuse of others (see K. Weil). In the beginning, Professor Lurie is presented as a self-important, divorced, and aging man who subjects women (including his students) and animals to his desires. He regards both as existing for his own use and pleasure and denies that either might have a right to a life or love of their own. In the course of the novel, however, during which he is dismissed from the University for sexual harassment and then finds himself and his daughter subjected to acts of violence from others, Lurie becomes, unaccountably, moved by the suffering of the animals he encounters on his daughter's farm and, perhaps through them, to her suffering as well. As he befriends the woman in charge of the local animal shelter where dogs are abandoned and ultimately euthanized, he insists on accompanying the animals in their final moments and looking into their eyes at the moment of death. Ensuring a proper incineration after the act becomes his newjob. It is ajob motivated by the realization that to die alone is, in this society, the worst indignity, evidence of a life unloved and unmourned. In the case of the crippled dog, however, a different reading also presents itself. The narrator mentions that Lurie refrained from calling this dog "his" or giving him a name, evidence, it might seem, of his efforts not to enter into relationship of ownership or domination with the dog. But in "giving him up" it is clear that some form of relationship?whether of</page><page sequence="4">jac guardianship or ownership (though on the part of whom it is not clear since Lurie says "he has been adopted" by the dog) or, perhaps love?has already taken place (215). And Lurie's way of dealing with love, we know from earlier in the novel, is to manage it whether by paying for it or otherwise assuming full control. "I lack the lyrical. Imanage love too well," he says as a way of explaining his affair with his student (121). Love must be worthy of Wordsworth, or it must simply satisfy ones "natural" needs through good management. But the dog neither acts as an inspiration for high lyricism, nor satisfies any simple needs of nature. What the dog can offer is a relationship or love of the kind that Lurie, for much of his life refused (and now feels himself drawn into)?"that force that drives the utmost strangers into each other's arms making them kin, kind beyond all prudence" (194). In other words, the relationship with the dog offers a love that is not easily managed, love, or even friendship that is messy because it cannot always be separated from dependence and power, but is not to be spurned because of that. My point is that it is possible to read the transformation Lurie undergoes as a replacement of his aesthetic ideal with an ideal of justice or morality, but in both cases he sacrifices those around him for that ideal, rather than let himself be drawn further into a relation that compromises it.3 In this way,his ideal is not unlike Francione's: if all relations between humans and domestic animals are relations of masters and slaves, we must let all the animal-slaves die out, so that we humans can feel good about ourselves and our purity. Such an ideal, it seems to me, is wrong for a number of reasons. It is shamelessly anthropocentric. It suggests that animals should be extin guished for the sake of the moral purity of humans. Would that moral purity not be better served by letting humans die out? This anthropocentrism, moreover, and the moral ideal it upholds are grounded in a false view of history, of nature, and of evolution. In such a view, history is a process of human agency or activity over nature. As anthropologist Tim Ingold writes, "the story we tell about human exploitation and domestication of animals is part of a more encompassing story about how humans have risen above and have sought to bring under control a world of nature that includes their own animality" (61). In other words, Ingold adds, "when we speak of domestication as an intervention in nature, humanity's transcen dence over the natural world is already presupposed" (61). To propose the</page><page sequence="5">Kari Weil 717 extinction of all domestic animals is thus to envision a redemptive "end of history" whereby humans rediscover their moral path through their ultimate transcendence or separation from the natural world.4 Let me say, first, that there is much to applaud in Francione's work. His concern for the mistreatment of all nonhuman animals, his insistence that nonhumans partake of the moral community regardless of their cognitive capacities, and, in a related manner, his critique of utilitarian attempts to draw a line according to which rights may be granted?all have merit. But his is also a view that forecloses the significance of the nonhuman world by seeing domestic animals as no more than slaves to their human masters. By focusing on human-animal relations solely in terms of property or master and slave, his view discounts the agency and social complexity of domestic animals?the desires of dogs and horses, for instance, for connection, affection, and bonding across species.5 There is no doubt that humans have abused and continue to abuse such affection, but to suggest that therefore dogs or horses should not exist is like saying women should not exist because men have abused them. It is to deny the ways that human and nonhuman animals alike (and here to speak only of domestic animals is to create another false dichotomy) have evolved together, producing more complex life forms through what biologist Lynn Margulis calls symbiogenesis: "intricate and multidirectional acts of association of and with other life forms" (Haraway 31).6 Francione's scenario puts faith instead in what Donna Haraway describes as the "culturally normal fantasy of human exceptionalism... the premise that humanity alone is not a spatial and temporal web of interspecies dependen cies" (11). This fantasy, for reasons that will become clear below, is one that feminists have been especially vocal in exposing and combating. The belief in human exceptionalism is founded on strict divisions between human and animal, or culture and nature, and perpetuates a dualist thinking that pits an active human (and masculine) master against a passive animal (and feminized) slave. In such a view, which can be traced at least as far back as Aristotle, women have been identified with animals and nature in their need to be tamed or controlled by the masculine, rational element. Feminists like Simone de Beauvoir view this identifica tion as a source of women's oppression and have promoted a dis identification with those forces of nature, the body, and the animal that</page><page sequence="6">718 jac were seen to be opposed to the privileged, rational element. De Beauvoir re-aligned women with the side of the rational master, but left the other dichotomies intact. More recently, however, subscribing to a thinking that is at once deconstructive and materialist as represented by the idea of "naturecultures" proffered by Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway, femi nists have begun to articulate an ethics that "repels presumptions of human mastery" not only because, in a post-humanist world, to equate the world of humans with culture (as opposed to nature) is understood to be illusory, but more importantly because it "reducefs] the stuff of life to mere 'resources' for human consumption" (Alaimo 251 ).7 What has come to be known as the material turn in feminist theory is an attempt to redress the blindness created, on the one hand, by feminism's own "abjection" of nature?its effort to separate itself from the defilement that is associated with the feminine?and, on the other hand, its consequent embracing of poststructuralism's insistence that the material "real" is produced by discourse or language.8 Such a view can only promote the kind of anthropocentrism that Ingold calls to our attention, because it discounts the "more than human world" as anything other than a human product. Donna Haraway's most recent When Species Meet culminates a career spent trying to critique and correct such views and to find ways to talk about nature, animals, and the material world in other than dualist terms. Along with Barad's Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning, Haraway and Latour have influenced an emerging group of "material feminists" who insist on the inseparable entanglement and interactions of the human and nonhuman worlds. As expressed in Stacy Alaimo and Susan Hekman's introduction to the collected essays in Material Feminisms, "they are developing theories in which nature is more than a passive social construction but is, rather, an agentic force that interacts with and changes the other elements in the mix, including the human" (Material Feminisms 7). In Disgrace, it is Lucy, Lurie's daughter, who espouses the view of the entanglement of the human and animal worlds?for better or for worse: "This is the only life there is. Which we share with animals"(74). This view guides the way she lives her life; she hopes to improve the lives of animals and "to share some of our human privilege with the beasts." For Lurie, however, such a view is, at first, deliberately resisted, and if during</page><page sequence="7">Kari Weil 719 the novel he is increasingly affected by the sheep awaiting slaughter or the dogs awaiting euthanasia, we can only attribute it to them, to the force of the nonhuman world and the impact it can have on humans. It is through this unwilled and unreasoned force that Lurie begins to experience, if not to acknowledge, his kinship with the animals, a kinship that consists first and foremost in having a body that is part of the world of matter or nature. But this, he understands, as a kinship of humiliation and disgrace, the shame of growing old, the shame of being the product of a fertile body, the shame of having to face death.9 Such abjection is what Lurie sees and identifies with in the old crippled dog whom he euthanizes in what Alice Kuzniar sees as an act of communion produced through "empathetic shame" (179)." Kuzniar praises such empathy as a way of also accepting or acknowledging abjection in oneself, rather than disavowing it by projecting it onto an animal. In "giving up" the dog, Lurie is moved to relieve the dog (and perhaps himself as well) once and for all of his shameful existence. Coetzee's foregrounding of shared, empathic embodiment is one reason that his fictions figure prominently in work by feminists from the "care tradition." In their introduction to The Feminist Care Tradition in Animal Ethics, Josephine Donovan and Carol Adams cite Coetzee as promoting " an awakening of moral awareness, which requires a kind of visceral empathy for the suffering of others" (15). Such empathy is understood to be a necessary first step in tending to animals, which must be joined by political analysis to understand the causes of suffering. Donovan later relates this kind of empathy to the notion of "attentive love" developed first by Simone Weil and later by Iris Murdoch as a moral reorientation away from the self and to the particular experience of an other. "Attentive Love" seems a particularly apt term to describe the euthanizing of dogs in Disgrace. "He has leaned by now... to concentrate all his attention on the animal they are killing, giving it what he no longer has difficulty in calling by its proper name: love" (219). Attention and empathy are key words in the feminist care tradition where the emphasis on the need for an ethic to respond to situated, particular experiences of suffering that are often overlooked by rights based or rule-based philoso phies. And yet, as feminists within the care tradition have themselves advised, empathy can be problematic insofar as it erases boundaries of</page><page sequence="8">720 jac difference between self and other, assuming that my suffering, or worse, my shame, is yours.10 "Attentive love," as Simone Weil originally de scribes it, is not only the recognition of suffering, but also the recognition of suffering in someone exactly like us. This is how the final scene of Disgrace has been read?Lurie identifying with the suffering and conse quently the shame of the old dog. Kuzniar writes, for example, that "Coetzee suggests that the embodiment of shame in another can serve as a point of identification and empathy, perhaps even for the expression of compassionate love" (117). The concept of shame is important to consider, not only because it is a central theme in Coetzee's novel (and in Derrida, mentioned alongside Coetzee in Donovan and Adam's introduction as two of the "most influential thinkers of our time"), but also because it is the singular emotion that, at least since Darwin, has been theorized to distinguish humans from animals.11 This is because shame depends on self-consciousness, and on the supposed ability to transcend one's body or ones nature. If freedom, from Aristotle to Sartre, is understood to be the distinctly human possibility of being cause of oneself or not being enslaved to ones body, shame results from the awareness (especially in the face of another) of not living up to this idea of freedom. In the writings of Coetzee and in Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am, however, shame seems to expose our kinship with animals even at the moment we most wish to deny it. Shame is the fact of our nudity, our bodily being that we can hide but cannot overcome. Shame, as Emmanuel Levinas writes, depends on "the very Being of our being... its incapacity to break with itself (qtd. in Leys 172). Freedom, then, is an anthropocentric illusion of shamelessness that is blind to the unfreedoms that also determine human lives. But perhaps the problem is that of regarding freedom and shame as necessarily and absolutely opposed. Freedom, Donna Haraway writes, "cannot be defined as the opposite of necessity if the mindful body in all its thickness is not to be disavowed, with all the vile consequences of such disavowal for those assigned to bodily entrammelment such as women, the colonized, and the whole list of others' who cannot live inside the illusion that freedom comes only when work and necessity are shuffled off onto someone else"(73). Indeed, Lurie and his daughter have very different ideas of freedom and consequently of shame. He tells his daughter the</page><page sequence="9">Kari Weil 721 story of a pet golden retriever who became unmanageable whenever a bitch was around and was punished so often that eventually "it no longer needed to be beaten. It was ready to punish itself." But Lucy takes issue with the moral of the story. "So males must be allowed to follow their instincts unchecked? Is that the moral?" "No, that is not the moral," Lurie responds. "What was ignoble... was that the poor dog had begun to hate its own nature_At that point it would have been better to shoot it" (90). Lurie's ethic is that of a Nietzschean self-affirmation?death is better than becoming a shameful exemplar of a domesticated or slave morality. This is how he regards his own situation as well. Having fallen "from grace" into that degraded state that he previously assigned to others, he interiorizes the contempt that he had previously only directed outward. Lucy, in contrast, identifies, not with the dog who must be restrained, but with that dog's would-be victim and thus sees the situation differently. Both before and after her rape, which turns the tables of racism to reveal her and her father's powerlessness before an increasingly powerful class of black men, she refuses to let "subjugation" define her life. For her, there is no enduring shame in having limitations on one's freedom (or having it violently taken away), because she neither considers freedom nor shame to be absolutes. She understands that to live (or to produce life) means giving in to relations that restrict and even, at times, humiliate. But that, she says "may be a good point to start from again"(205).12 For Lucy, it would seem, shame can be overcome and it can even be productive. Indeed, it allows her to see what is vulnerable in others (even her rapists) by producing empathy without contempt. If she refuses her father's efforts to save or rescue her by helping her move away, it is because she refuses to accept her predicament, unjust as it is, as a state of shame. The crippled dog, however, cannot refuse. Lurie's empathy for the dog?and for his daughter?is evidence both of his profound transformation and of his short sightedness. From an anthropocentric faith in human exceptionalism, Lurie comes to see shame as an ontological state shared with the others around him. But the line here between empathic suffering and anthropomorphism (or narcissism) is thin, and it is dangerous to believe that love for animals consists only in putting them out of their misery. Philosopher and animal trainer, Vicki Hearne, has described the "sin of pride" which consists in imagining "that one has</page><page sequence="10">722 jac unmediated awareness of the cruelty" or suffering of animals (Hearne 23 7). Hearne is critical of the way that, following Bentham, suffering has become the exclusive focus of the attention of so-called animal lovers or the animal rights movement, as if we all know in what suffering consists, and hence, how to relieve it. In an elegant and polemical reading of the Biblical story of Job who was an upright or, in other terms, "a humane man," Hearne explains that Job learns that his "uprightnesses" are "nothing but pedantries beside the . . . sort of thing learned in the contemplation of animals." And this is because "the love of animals is not professed in a catechism of their suffering," she declares, "but in uncanny catechisms of their joys" (229). These joys can only be learned through attention to and acknowledgment of each animal's particular tempera ment. In the case of the old dog, Lurie is moved by his idea of disgrace more than by attention to the dog himself, whose signs of joy?the way, for instance, he "smacks his lips" in time with Lurie's music?or whose signs of building his own world, Hearne would say, he ultimately betrays. He refuses what Haraway calls "the unsettling obligation of curiosity" (a critique she also brings against Derrida and his cat), and turns away from his world to wonder whether he can aestheticize such a creature by casting him in his opera (36). To be sure, tending to the joys of another may be equally as demanding as tending to their pain. In either case, it would seem that the responsibili ties of such an "adopted" relation are too much for Lurie to bear, more than he can manage and more than he has allowed from any human relation. Animals (and in particular domestic animals) impact us when offered the possibility of doing so, when they are not removed from sight in factories or laboratory cages. They move us, they call upon us, and thus they interfere with the will to be wholly free especially when such freedom is understood as the anthropocentric and masculinist idea of the ability to separate from the body or from physical and emotional dependency. Animals interfere with our "idea of the world" if that idea refuses to see that we must all share the responsibilities of responding to the other's vulnerabilities and affection. Perhaps this is why Francione can see freedom only in death. Hearne, by contrast, would look at the old dog's musical appreciation, at what she calls the "pieties" and "the unlikely and unsuspected</page><page sequence="11">Kari Weil 723 happinesses" of animals and people alike and see this as a "rebuke to moral excesses" (23 8). Indeed, Lurie is in agreement with Hearne on one thing, that domestic animals are unconcerned with the "uprightness" of human morality, unconcerned with the purity of abstract ideas of freedom or kindness, though they are concerned with the consequences of specific practices.13 "Freedom," Vicki Hearne writes (echoing Emmanuel Levinas), "can never be justified, only renderedjust" (237). And, like kindness, it is rendered just only through knowing an animal over time in a sustained relation, whether that relationship be one of care, of companionship, or work.14 The ambiguity of Coetzee's ending stems from the fact that, in at least one way, Lurie's action is "rendered just." He refuses to allow the animals to die alone, in the individual attention he bestows upon each animal so that they may die, loved, he makes each one a"grievable life."15 This is Judith Butler's term for a life that can be properly mourned, a life that, in her terms, is recognized as a human life (20). Lurie demands at least this final possibility for animal lives, making sure that he, at least, will grieve even if no one else will. He does not wish for their disappearance; instead, he mourns their (and his) shame. In this, he moves in a very different direction from the moral uprightness of Francione, who, in seeing only animal slaves, sees no loss in their death. That, in my view, is shameful. Wesleyan University Middletown, Connecticut Notes 1. This is a slightly revised version of an essay that originally appeared as "Liberty ehonfcT ("Shameless Freedom") in Critique(Aug-Sept, 2009): 664-77. 2. The paper was delivered for the monthly meetings of the Animal Ethics Group at the Yale University Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, 4 Dec. 2008. 3. While I am in agreement with Donovan's reading in terms of a conversion, because I still see that conversion in terms of ideas, my reading is closest to Attridge and to a lesser extent with Tremaine, who suggests that Lurie's coming to terms with death and suffering is not primarily intersubjective: "it is one for the self in itself (609). In other words, the particular relationship that exists between Lurie and the dog is irrelevant to his transformation.</page><page sequence="12">724 jac 4. This might be a third scenario to add to the two Heideggerean scenarios of the end of history that Giorgio Agamben describes in The Open. In the first scenario, animality is offered up to be governed "by means of technology;" in the second, animality is regarded not as something to be governed or mastered, nor as something hidden, but rather is "thought as such, as "pure abandonment" (80). In this third, animality is destroyed with the extinction of animals. 5. On recent views regarding the history of domestication, see Cassidy and Mullin. 6. On Margulis and the implications of her work on symbiogenesis, see Haraway30-33. 7. On this point also, see Birke and Parisi. 8. I use the term "abjection" in the sense of casting off or attempting to separate oneself from those natural elements of feces or blood or milk that are seen to defile the self and which are associated with the maternal-feminine. For an elaboration of this meaning of abjection, see Kristeva, especially chapter three. 9. Such a kinship of shameful bodies is what Tremaine foregrounds but without really questioning the meaning or status of shame. 10. Gruen, for instance, writes of the importance of the empathic person as having a "distinct self... so when she is imaginatively engaging with the other, she doesn't believe herself to be in the other's situation" (Gruen 337). 11. The Expression ofthe Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin focuses on the act of "blushing," "the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions," which is caused by shame (309). 12. It should be said that this can be an especially risky view for those who are already marginalized. 13. In Derrida's essay, uprightness concerns not only the stance of the human, but through its association with erection, the sign of masculine power and authority. 14. Hearne, like Haraway, thinks of relationships with animals in terms ofwork, not of use. 15. Attridge says something similar when he writes that Lurie dedicates himself to "the singularity of every living and dead being" (117). Works Cited Agamben, Giorgio. The Open: Man and Animal.
