Oceania 26 (1991) 119-122 Archaeology and geomorphology of the Vanimo Coast, Papua New Guinea: preliminary results Paul Gorecki, Mark Mabin and John Campbell Abstract We report here excavations at two near-coastal rockshelters near Vanimo, West Sepik Province. Preliminary results include late Pleistocene occupation and mid-Holocene ceramics and pigs, along with a continuing, wide-ranging but marine-oriented economy. The archaeological sites are integrated into a tectonic uplift history for the region in which a number of coral terraces have been identified. The main aims of this multidisciplinary project are to establish the first archaeological records for the Vanimo coast (Fig. 1), to understand its geomorphology - taking into account that tectonic uplift is outpacing sea-level rises - and to provide a clearer picture of cultural changes and human adaptations to new and dynamic environments. As the Irian Jaya border is only 15 km west of the study area, some of the results presented here will be of relevance to the prehistory of Irian's northern coast (Solheim 1979; Solheim and Ap 1977). Pilot surveys and soundings were carried out by Gorecki in 1988 and 1989. These covered the 35 km of coast from Vanimo west to the PNG-Irian Jaya border, and the Leitre area 40 km east of Vanimo (Fig. 1). Near Leitre a rock shelter covered with geometric and anthropomorphic engravings was found, but it was the area west of Vanimo that appeared 141° «Ol ^^' Musu-Fichin 0 50 km e°V/~^^i·^ 0 L__, ι_ι ι 1 * ^XiR«ANp&gt;ApuA JAYA i NEW GUINEA" BISMARCK SEA ¿^vL/^vV ^Jayapura Musu-Fichin ^ X_. / ' VS^J ' *-^-*. ^^ ' I á â^e *^im0 AUSTRALIA ' &lt;¡5 ^vLeitre 142° Ζ I UJ ^ -L o _3o &lt;|2 ^&gt; 3- o 5E j 3 *V - ^_Aitape J 2 Be**nf Mountains 1 42° ^^ Figure 1.

Numerous surface finds of obsidian flakes were made (all derived from Manus, Wai Ambrose pers. comm. 1989), and surface scatters of prehistoric pottery sherds were observed widely along the coastline. The Musu-Fichin area was estimated to have the greatest potential for an intensive archaeological investiga- tion. This S km stretch of coastline is about 1 1 km east of the border and 18 km west of Vanimo. During June- July 1990, three rock shelters were excavated. Itamesori shelter (Site RIT) is at 2°38'19"S/ 141°06Ί8Έ (sheet 7192, Vanimo 1: 100,000, grid reference 117084). It is 1.12 km from the coast and 185 m above mean sea level. Taora shelter (Site RIU) is at 2°37'57"S/ 141°06'24Έ (grid reference 119090). It is 450 m from the coast and llm above mean sea level. Lachitu shelter (Site RIQ) is at 2°38O2tlS/141°08llllfE (grid reference 152088). It is 150 m from the coast and 25 m above mean sea level. At this stage only the two lower-level coastal shelters (Taora and Lachitu) have been analysed and preliminary data from these sites are presented below. Geomorphic setting The three sites investigated are situated on the lower slopes of the Oenake Range. This is an uplifted complex of deep-water volcanic rocks overlain by younger shallow-water reefal limestones (Hutchinson and Norvick 1980). The highest point is Mt. Bougainville (1220 m) 3.5 km east of the border and only 5 km inland, although the whole uplifted block extends some 30 km inland and east to near Vanimo. The area is completely covered by dense equatorial rainforest which obscures most of the landscape details. However, a number of uplifted coral reef tracts of late Pleistocene age can be identified on the northern slopes of the range. The highest occurs at about 400 m above sea level, and is 2.5 km inland. The Itamesori site is in the outer edge of a fossil reef complex at 200 m elevation. The Lachitu site is near the base of a fossil reef that rises to about 120 m. This is the lowest of the uplifted late Pleistocene coral reef tracts. The present coastal environment consists of a fringing reef with small beaches at the mouths of streams, backed by a narrow coastal plain. The Taora site is on the inner margin of the coastal plain, at the base of an abandoned sea cliff that was the outer edge of the lowest elevated late Pleistocene reef tract. Wellman and McCracken (1979) show that the area lies in a complex plate tectonic setting on the margin of the Australian Plate which is here moving north into the North Bismarck Plate. Coral reef tracts up to 400 m above sea level are evidence of the rapid and ongoing tectonic uplift of the area. Dense rainforest cover prevented detailed examination of the elevated late Pleistocene reefs, however observations were made on the Holocene coastal plain and modern fringing reef complex. A raised fringing reef complex extends more-or-less continuously along the coastline west of Vanimo. The few 119</page><page sequence="2">places it is absent are associated with river or stream mouths where small pocket beaches occur. In the study area the fringing reef is some ISO m wide, and its outer part consists of a karstic coral-algal limestone ramp SO m across and rising to about the level of high water at spring tides. This indicates an uplift of at least 1.4S m above the current level of open-water coral growth. Behind the ramp is a broad shallow intertidal pool, which at low tide retains a depth of about O.S m of water at a height slightly above mean sea level. It has probably formed by solution of the former reef flat after it had been uplifted. It now forms a remarkable natural fishtrap and is often used by the local villagers. On the inner margin of the pool is a narrow carbonate sand beach rising to 2 m above mean sea level. Behind the fringing reef complex is a coastal plain which is between 150-600 m wide. At the Taora site it is at 9 m above mean sea level, and it declines gently over a distance of 4S0 m to be at S m near the coast It is interpreted as an uplifted mid Holocene fringing reef complex. The Taora shelter is at the inner margin of the coastal plain and occupies a marine notch cut into a cliff of late Pleistocene coralline limestone. The notch is partly infilled by a clean carbonate sand beach deposit rising to nearly 9 m above the modern beach. A Tridacna sp. shell from the clean sands gave an age of 5640 ± 80 yr BP (ANU 7601).1 Assuming sea level at 5640 years BP was at its present height, this represents an uplift rate of about 1.50 mm/yr. A sample of Acropora sp. coral from below the outer part of the coastal plain at 3m above mean sea level and 425 m north of the Taora site, gave an age of 5820 ± 80 yr BP (ANU 7607)1 . This indicates that a broad fringing reef was already in place when the beach was formed. Uplift of the coastal plain probably occurred shortly after the beach was formed. Taora shelter (Site RIU) Two trenches were excavated in the L-shaped Taora shelter. One was one square metre (F4) on one side of the site, the other was a 2 χ 1 m trench (X2 and X3) on the other side and 5 m from F4. The cultural deposit is 1 15 cm thick, and rests on the white, soft coral beach sands. As there is no inter-fingering of the beach sands and cultural material, it is assumed that tectonic uplift had raised the site above the level of wave activity prior to occupation. Dates obtained (Table 1) indicate that occupation began as soon as the site had been uplifted. A neat fireplace (at the base of trench X2) dug into the clean beach sand yielded ages of 5860 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 7606) and 6120 ± 190 yr BP (ANU 7605). There is no clear stratigraphie change throughout the cultural deposit, and the bulk of » has accumulated at a very fast rate. At 90 cm above the base we have obtained shell dates of 5370 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 7702) for X2 and 54 10 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 761 1) for F4. The upper 2O-30cm have accumulated more slowly, since we have a date of 2250 ± 70 yr BP (ANU 7701) at about 15 cm depth.

A reservoir correction of -400 years has been applied to the shell dates (Chappell and Polach 1991). Most of the Taora deposit is a shell midden. The amount of shell and stone per volume of deposit increases with depth until white beach sand is reached where it becomes sterile. A curious but distinctive discard behaviour was noted at the site: in square F4 the shells themselves were predominantly found, while operculums were essentially recovered in X2 and X3. The shell material is being currently analysed in Port Moresby (by Pamela Swadling) but preliminary sorting by Michele Bird (JCU) of samples for radiocarbon dating suggests that at least 23 shell species are present. These shell species indicate an exploitation of reef, rocky and sandy shores, beach, mangrove and freshwater resources. The lithic material recovered from Taora is abundant: 618 artefacts (3.5 kg) from F4, 1249 artefacts (4.7 kg) from X2 and 2019 artefacts (10.0 kg) from X3. A very high proportion of these 3886 stone artefacts are made from fine grained chert, presumably found locally amongst the limestone. Only one ground stone axe fragment was found. Of greater interest are two other types of artefacts. One is very thin and made of pale blue slate not available locally. The largest fragment, which is almost complete, suggest a tanged form, very much like a find made near Ambunti (Swadling et al 1988: 20). The most recent slate at Taora occurs in an excavation level dated to 2250 ± 70 yr BP (ANU 7701), although most are found in levels older than 5400 years BP. The function of these artefacts is unknown, but it is hoped that residue analysis will provide a functional interpretation. The other lithic artefact type consists of 15 small flakes which have a clear use-wear notch about 1 cm in width and 0.5 cm in depth and found throughout the deposit Pending residue analysis, these are interpreted as tools used to scrape or shave circular wooden artefacts such as arrows. Red and yellow ochre was found throughout the deposit. Pottery sherds were also found at Taora. Most are in the upper levels, with the pottery tradition appearing in the mid- Holocene part of the sequence. For square F4, sherds are not present at a level dated to 5630 ± 100 yr BP (ANU 7612) while they are present at a level dated to 5410 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 7611). These dates are corroborated by results obtained from trenches X2 and X3. There, pottery is absent 1. These dates arc conventional C ages of marine shell, with a reservoir correction of -400 years (Chappell and Polach, 1991). 120</page><page sequence="3">from below a level dated to 5550 ± 70 yr BP (ANU 7604) while it is present in a level dated to 5370 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 7702). A total of 35 sherds were recovered from the mid- Holocene levels. We are aware of the importance of these dates and of possible vertical displacement of artefacts, yet we are confident that pottery first appears at Taora about 5400 years ago. In many ways Taora has a rather similar history to the Dongan site in the Ramu (Swadling et al. 1988) and supports strongly the claim for the presence on mainland New Guinea of a pottery tradition that substantially pre-dates the Lapita tradition (Swadling et al 1989). Overall 78 sherds (442 g) were found in F4: only one was a body decorated (incised) sherd, six were rim sherds two of which were decorated. In X2, 191 sherds (956 g) were found. Amongst diagnostic sherds there were 4 decorated body sherds (all incised), 9 plain and 4 decorated rim sherds. For X3, 145 sherds (505 g) were found, including 3 decorated (incised) body and 7 plain rim sherds. More analysis of this material is underway. What is perhaps significant to note is that as soon as pottery is present, two sources appear to be involved. One is beach sand temper added to a fine-grained clay, while the other is a rather coarse-grained clay used without the addition of any temper. Faunal remains were rather poor and badly fragmented throughout the Taora deposit. Animals that have been identified by John Ericho and Jim Menzies (UPNG) include giant crabs, large lizards and snakes, fish, bandicoots, rats, wallabies, and tree kangaroos. Species they identify include Melomys sp., Dorcopsis hageni, Phalanger orientalis, Pseudocheirus breviceps, Uromys caudimaculatus and Echymipera kalubu (Flannery 1990). Pig remains (Sus scrofa) were found throughout the deposit. This is not a surprise since the time range is within the accepted antiquity for pig introduction in New Guinea (Golson and Hughes 1980). Small fragments of human remains were also found throughout the deposit. Lachitu shelter (site RIQ) The shelter is a well formed sea cave, 12 m across and up to 3 m high at the entrance. It extends 20 m into the reefal limestone cliff and terminates in two small galleries now partly filled with roof-fall material. Only 1 m2 was excavated down to a depth of 115 cm below surface where roof fall rocks were reached. The deposit consisted entirely of a sticky black organic-rich soil with no obvious stratigraphie break. It is probable that more cultural deposit will be found below the roof fall layer during field work in 1991. Shell midden material resting on the surface of the roof fall layer has been dated to 13,940 ± 160 yr BP (ANU 7603). Three more late Pleistocene ages were obtained, two of which provide data on sedimentation rate, showing that about 65 cm of deposit accumulated over a 2000 year period (Table 2). This Pleistocene occupation of Lachitu may have been followed by a cultural hiatus since a date of 12,300 ± 1 10 yr BP (ANU 7699) at a depth of 50 cm is followed by a date of 5610 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 7609) at 30 cm depth. Another more recent cultural hiatus may exist nearer the surface, from 5640 ± 80 yr BP (ANU 7602) to 780 ± 70 yr BP (ANU 7698).

A reservoir correction of -400 years has been applied to all these dates (Chappell and Polach, 1990). As in Taora, the dominant cultural material that accumulated at Lachitu is shell midden: 21 species have been identified, including IS in the Pleistocene deposit. A great variety of shellfish was also exploited from Lachitu, even though sea level at 12,000 to 14,000 years ago was 100-60 m lower than today (Bard et al. 1990). Reaching the sea then would have required a steep descent to a diversified shore line that included reefs, sand beaches, rocky shores, mangroves and fresh water. Only 112 stone artefacts (2.3 kg) were recovered from Lachitu. Overall these are larger and heavier than at Taora, despite being derived essentially from the same raw material (with a few exceptions). Preliminary analysis has revealed only 2 notable artefacts: one ground edge adze, occurring in a level dated at 5610 ± 90 yr BP (ANU 7609) and one notched flake, similar to those recovered at Taora, occurring in a level dated at 13,570 ± 200 yr BP (ANU 7700). Eighty pottery sherds (328 g) were recovered, most of which were in the upper 5 cm of the deposit. Faunal remains were few and fragmented. Animals identified include wallaby, giant crab, fish, and cuscus. Species identified include Echymipera clara, Dorcopsis hageni and Phalanger gymnotis. These are found in all levels including the late Pleistocene. Discussion Although Taora and Lachitu are only 3.5 km from each other, they each represent a different slice of the local cultural history while being at the same time complementary to each other. On present evidence, three time periods are represented. The earliest covers the late Pleistocene human occupation of the Vanimo coast during the period 14,000- 12,000 BP. The Lachitu site provides an array of Pleistocene cultural evidence which is so far lacking for coastal mainland New Guinea. Along this north coast of what was then Greater Australia (or Sahul), people were using a wide variety of shell fish resources. At the time Lachitu was occupied, it was probably not an attractive site, perched high up on a cliff overlooking the sea which was some 100 m below. We interpret it as a refuge site rather than a base camp. Occupation appears to have ceased for several thousand years after about 12,000 yr BP. Throughout the late Pleistocene Taora simply did not exist. The second period spans 5800-5400 yr BP. During this time, both Lachitu and Taora were occupied and enigmatic 121</page><page sequence="4">slate tools appear. A possible arrow-making stone tool is also present If confirmed from residue and use-wear analysis, this may represent use of bows and arrows in Melanesia from at least the mid-Holocene (see Fullagar 1989). In addition, pottery using two distinct clay sources appears towards the end of this period. The end of this sequence may have been marked by an uplift which caused dramatic environmental changes. The sea retreated to a new position and people relocated themselves nearer the new coastline. Taora was now hundreds of metres from the shore and of less interest to the local communities. Lachitu, a potentially dangerous cave site, may have been viewed as unstable resulting in lack of interest in the site despite it being by now very close to the shore. The third sequence covers the last 2100 years for Taora and at least the last 700 years for Lachitu. From then on, these sites are visited only occasionally and for brief periods by people bringing in the occasional clay pot and a few shells. They are marginal to local communities and little archaeological accumulation has occurred.
