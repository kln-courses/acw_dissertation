<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SYMBOLISM AND SIGNIFICANCE OF E~PA-TYPE MASQUERADE HEADPIECES J. R. 0. Ojo University of Ift, Ile-Ife, Nigeria Among the Ekiti and Igbomina Yoruba of Nigeria is a group of closely related masquerades subsumed under the name Epa. These are: Epa, Elqfon, Eriru and Okotorosho whose performances, depending on locality, are staged between March and September every year or every other year. The hoodlike headpieces of Eriru and Okotorosho masquerades are shaped like inverted earthenware cooking pots. The lower sections of Epa and Elqfon masquerades have these basic shapes, but surmounted by animal and human figures. The names of the headpieces, as well as the names of individual masquerades, are based on the sculptural motifs on the superstructures of the headpieces. These motifs include mothers with children which are connected with the Yoruba's desire for plentiful issue; warrior motifs which reflect the wars waged against the Ekiti and Igbomina in the past; and motifs based on Qsanyin, the god of medicine; these emphasise another attribute of this group of masquerades as giver of physical and spiritual health. Introduction This article explains the symbolism and significance of some carved masquerade headpieces by examining them in the context in which they are used by the Ekiti and Igbomina Yoruba of Nigeria. The former were not in the past organised into a single political unit, but consisted of sixteen kingdoms which in the nineteenth century united to form a confederate army in order to dislodge their Ibadan overlords (Akintoye 1971: 76 sqq; Johnson 1921: 43 9 sqq) .1 Ibadan was not Ekiti's only adversary. As early as the fifteenth century, Benin troops were active in Ekiti, and Qtun in northern Ekiti was the buffer between QyQ and Benin empires (Egharevba 1934: 12, 45; Lloyd 1962: 52). There were also military incursions from the north, by Nupe and Ilorin cavalry. These bellicose events are reflected in Ekiti art and ritual. Ekiti Yoruba rituals The deities worshipped by the Ekiti Yoruba are in some respects different from those of other parts of Yorubaland. Although deities such as Ifa, Qsanyin, Ogun and Oro occur all over Yorubaland, Ogun and Ifa, extending even beyond Yorubaland, most Ekiti deities, like the masquerades, are peculiar to Ekiti. Each town constitutes an autonomous ritual community with its own group of deities which may be different from those of adjacent towns. Some deities are, however, common to groups of neighbouring towns. Like other parts of Yorubaland, the masked rituals of Ekiti form part of the religious ceremonial cycle of each town. Generally, all over Yorubaland, the Man (N.S.) 13, 455-470</page><page sequence="2">456 J. R. 0. OJO forms and functions of masquerades vary from one sub-ethnic group to another (Ojo 1974: 46-55). Egungun, of which there are ancestral and entertainment varieties, are found among the QyQ Yoruba groups.2 AgqmQ, Agbo and ]kinq are three of the masquerades found among the Ijqbu, whilst Gqlqdq3 and ]pa-type masquerades are found among the ]gbado and Ekiti respectively. Masquerade costumes may be made of cloth as in Gqldq, cloth and leather as is the case with Egungun, palm fronds and cloth as in ]pa. The costume may completely cover the masker. This is imperative with Egungun. It may partially conceal the masker, the hands and legs left bare as is the case with Gqlqdq and ]pa. The costume may be surmounted by a headpiece of carvings, animal skulls, bones or combinations of these and other objects. While carved headpieces are optional in Egungun, they form an indispensable part of AgqmQ, Gqlqdq and ]pa masquerade costumes. In case of ]pa, the names of individual headpieces are based on the sculptural motifs on the superstructures of the headpieces. The names refer to the headpiece when not in use, to the masquerade (when the masker carries the headpiece in a ceremony), and the ceremonies in which the masquerades appear. Ekiti Yoruba masquerades In Ekiti, ]pa is just one of several types of masquerades that are to be found. For instance in Ado, there are Eigun ire, the masquerade of good fortune, Eshishe and ]pa, among others.4 ]pa headpieces are stylistically similar to at least three other masquerade headpieces, namely, Flqfon, Eriru and Okotorosho. The ceremonies in which the four are used are similar. In some cases, all four are referred to as ]pa; in other cases, they are regarded as separate entities. In Ido, headpieces in ]pa group include ]pa, ]lqfon, Eriru and Okotorosho; but in Ayetoro (Iyapa), the four are regarded as belonging to different groups, each of the four constituting a group. In actual fact, Eriru and Okotorosho headpieces are identical, as are ]pa and Flqfon headpieces (cf. Ojo 1974: I65-7; 1975). Eriru and Okotorosho headpieces are like inverted cooking pots and are therefore referred to as koko, pot, in some towns (Carroll 1956: 5). They are single or double faced, and may be surmounted with feathers. ]lqfon and ]pa headpieces consist of this basic shape, but have superstructures of animal or human figures varying in number from one to as many as twenty. The individual names of the headpieces are based on the motifs on the superstructures (cf. Carroll 1956: 7). Thus, a headpiece with a leopard motif is Oloko, leopard; another with a foot soldier or equestrian motif is Ologun or Jagunjagun, warrior; one with mother and children motif is QlQmQyeye, owner of many children. These names and many more occur in songs and other verbal utterances during the ceremonies in which the headpieces are used. These names provide invaluable clues to the elucidation of the symbolism and significance of the headpieces. ]pa-type masquerade headpieces may be kept by lineage heads and town chiefs either on behalf of the lineage or the town. In any case, they are used in ceremonies which are supposed to benefit everybody in the town. They may</page><page sequence="3">J. R. 0. OJO 457 be kept in the custodians' house, in the corner of a sitting room where they are hidden from view by palm fronds; or in special enclosures and shrine houses in which esoteric rites connected with their usage take place. Objects such as swords, drums, bells, staffs and buffalo horns used during the ceremonies are also kept with them. Jpa-type masquerade ceremonies The variety of Epa-type masquerade ceremonies has been noted by Carroll (I956: 9) and Armstrong (1971: 42) following Rubin (I969: 36).5 In spite of these variations, there are some underlying similarities which I need not go into here.6 The ceremonies take place annually or every other year, as early as February or March in some places, and as late as September, in others. Preparations for staging performances include ceremonial washing when old paint and the dust that has accumulated on the headpieces since the previous performance are washed off. They are then repainted with a basic colour of reddish brown, and decorated with overall patterns of white, black and blue (cf. Carroll 1956: 6). The use of emulsion paint instead of, or in addition to, the locally prepared colours has increased the colour range which now includes yellow and orange. Fresh palm fronds are tied round the lower edge of the headpieces. More are provided to be tied round the masker's waist. In addition, two pieces of red cloth are tied to the front and back of the headpieces. These reach down beyond the masker's knees. Offerings may be made to the headpieces before they are placed on the masker's head, or at some point during the public part of the ceremony. Emphasis may be placed on the procession round the town, with the masquerade stopping at all entries to the town, all shrine houses and compounds; bor on the dances which take place in an appointed place which can be the front of the shrine house where the headpieces are kept, or in the market place. The composition of people taking part in the ceremonies is sometimes dependent on the kind of headpieces used. The warrior age grade is prominent in ceremonies in which headpieces with warrior motifs are used. In other ceremonies, officials from other religious groups such as Osanyin, the deity of medicine, may be present. Rites to other deities such as Ogun, god of war, and Oro (an ancestral cult) may be performed. Women are always prominent, as are youths and children of both sexes. If they do not participate in the ceremonies, they stage their own performances, either as part of the adult ceremonies, or at some other time during the ritual calendar. In general, the actors are drawn from the whole town, and are not restricted to the lineage whose head is the custodian of the headpieces. Various types of musical instruments are used. In some cases, the instruments and rhythms are peculiar to the Epa masquerade complex. In other cases, they are the drums and drum rhythms associated with other deities such as Oro and Qsanyin. In one case, the rhythm is that of a secular dance. Some of the artefacts, both natural and manufactured, used in the ceremonies, like some of the drums and drum rhythms, are found in the rituals of other deities. The artefacts used in the Epa masquerade complex form a constellation</page><page sequence="4">458 J. R. 0. OJO in which the headpieces are the most important. Like Lega art objects (Biebuyck I973), each of these objects gives us a clue to the significance of the headpieces. As Biebuyck puts it, 'whatever the form suggests is enriched by verbal, choreographic, gestural and configurational dimensions' (1973: I85). II I will now discuss three sets of sculptural motifs from the superstructures of E,pa masquerade headpieces. These are: mother-with-child or -children motifs which can be linked with the desire among the Yoruba for plentiful issue; equestrian motifs which I will link with the turbulent history of Ekiti and Igbomina in the nineteenth century; and thirdly, motifs based on Qsanyin, the deity associated with medicine. The motif will be discussed in relation to the Yoruba's preoccupation with medicative and curative preparations, charms and amulets, and the importance of medicine, oogun, not only in masking rituals, but other religious ceremonials. In discussing these motifs, it is assumed that factual meaning, as opposed to symbolic meaning, is apprehended by identifying visible forms with certain subjects (Panofsky 1955: 5I-55). For example, the figure of a woman carrying a child or that of a man on horseback carrying weapons of war, considered as pure forms, carry factual meaning. They are: 'mother-with-children' and 'warrior' respectively. These forms belong to the realm of artistic motifs or subject matter. But they can also carry intrinsic meaning (cf. Panofsky 1955: 53, 68). As forms, they have content which can be discerned by considering them in their social contexts. 'Mother-with-children' motifs These motifs range from a woman carrying a child on her back or knee, or carrying one on her back and another on her knee, to a woman surrounded by many children; hence, QlQmQyeye or QlQmQyQyQ, owner of many children. For those conversant with the Yoruba language, the meaning is self- explanatory as the words are closely identified with the factual meaning they convey. Some of the other names used for motifs in this group are: QmQbomi, children cover me (like a cloth), which brings to mind the Yoruba saying QmQ I'ashQ, children are (like) cloths, meaning that they are sources of protection or 'life insurance' especially in old age. QmQniyi, children are honourable to have; AkQmoa, the bringer of children, a name which refers to one of the attributes of this group of masquerades; Iya onibeji, mother of twins, used for those motifs with two children; Abiamo, nursing mother; and EyelQshun, priestess of Qshun, a deity believed to be particularly benevolent in giving people children. Carroll has consistently argued that these motifs do not represent any fertility spirit as some scholars claim, but are simply women with children, even though they may be prayed to for children. They might, he went on, 'represent Qshun who helps women bear children'. He conceded however that those representations named QlQmQyeye are closer to fertility sym-</page><page sequence="5">J. R. 0. OJO 459 bolism; and rightly concluded that the meaning must be sought for in each case (1956: IO; 1958: 7; cf. Ucko I962: 47). Quite recently, Carroll wrote: It is not possible at present to offer an assured interpretation and analysis of Yoruba carvings as an expression of the people's philosophy and religious belief African carvings have frequently been interpreted in abstract terms without any attempt to discover the people's interpretation . . . Records of the people's explanation and interpretation of the figures and anecdotes illustrated, or of the proverbs, songs, prayers and praise chants which may be associated with the objects scarcely exist (I973: i68). The dangers of taking actors' explanations as the only basis for the analysis of the symbolism of ritual objects are well known. But there is enough evidence in Father Carroll's writings to show that the mother-with-children motifs are directly or indirectly fertility symbols, and this can be supported by observations from ]pa-type masquerade ceremonies. Father Carroll's refutation is probably an over-reaction against those who have generalised the idea of fertility in Epa sculptural motifs to mother earth and the earth feeding mankind. Carroll claimed that interpretation by the people concerned is direct and concrete (I967: 30); it is worth starting with the literal meaning of the names of some of the headpieces bearing mother-with-children motifs. QlQmQyeye and QlQmQyQyQ convey the impression of bearing many children. This is a state of affairs which the Yoruba in their traditional setting wish for. QmQbomi, 'children cover or protect me'; and QmQniyi, 'children are honourable to have'; are succinct statements about the Yoruba attitude to children as they affect the individual. It is not enough to die at a ripe old age, it is imperative to have grown-up male children who will perform the funeral rites. After all, as one funeral song goes 'There is no joy in having children; only those who are buried by their children can be said to have had children'. A more pragmatic consideration in the traditional setting is the high infant mortality rate and the number of children required to help on the farm; and, in the case of females, with the domestic chores like fetching water and running errands. As a mother of four boys answered when queried as to why she wanted more children, 'I want a girl who will run errands for me'. The motifs whose names have been enumerated above can be regarded as potential fertility symbols, although in agreement with Carroll, it will be erroneous to extend the symbolism beyond human fertility to that of land and animals. But in opposition to Carroll, the mother-of-twins figures can be regarded as fertility symbols. The birth of twins is auspicious, their occurrence, like that of triplets, is regarded as an extraordinary case of human fertility. This may be one of the reasons for the popularity of the 'cult' of twins. According to Chief Qbalaaye of Iraye quarters in Ifq, one of the reasons for objecting to QyQ Yoruba refugees of the nineteenth-century wars settling in Ifq was that the 'QyQ are very fond of bearing twins'. But the fact of the case was that the cult of twins, if it existed at all among the Ifq, was not as elaborate as among the QyQ Yoruba. In one Ekiti village, one of the praise names of Orisha Oko, so-called 'deity of the farm and agriculture', is 'father of twins'.</page><page sequence="6">460 J. R. 0. OJO Ibeji statuettes are kept in the shrine, and it is believed that the deity can help devotees to have children. I have mentioned motifs named after Qshun which, in the words of Carroll 'helps women to bear children'. Qshun is a female deity associated with a river of the same name. Her cult, centred in Oshogbo, is found along the entire course of the river, from its source in the hills near ]fon, to its terminus on the Atlantic Coast, as well as other places where local streams serve as substitutes for river Qshun. It is believed everywhere that the deity is extremely benevolent in giving children to worshippers. Her devotees in Abqokuta sing: Ijo pmp re e, ilu pmp da. 'This is the dance of (for) children, where is the drumming of (for) children'. Another song says: 'Any one who celebrates with the deity (Qshun) will have plenty of children'. By naming ]pa-type masquerade headpieces after Qshun, the attributes of another deity have been incorporated into these masquerades in order to highlight what they are capable of doing, or what they should do for performers. Conversely, the attributes of ]pa-type masquerades could also be said to have been incorporated into Qshun, for there are some ]pa-type masquerade headpieces in the Qshun shrine at Oshogbo. One of these has big ears to hear prayers with, big eyes for seeing and a sword to defend his people (Verger 1954: i86; 1957: 407-8). In an Ekiti town, an ]pa-type masquerade headpiece, ]lqfon, has a pair of protuberant eyes fore and aft to show that 'Elqfon sees everything'. Swords are also associated with this type of masquerade even as far as If (Bascom 1944: 3 3; Fabunmi I969: 8). Also in the Qshun shrine at Oshogbo is a figure named Ologun, and another named Tqfonde, 'come from ifon', to indicate the origin (]fon) of the figure ]lefon, an ]pa-type masquerade headpiece supposed to have originated at or be named after ]fon (Carroll 1956: 4; Ojo 1974: 59, 98). Of the other names connected with the mother-and-children motifs, we have those named after the ancestress (putative and mythical) of each ritual community; Qja, princess; QmQrubu, plump child; AbiamQ, nursing mother; Qbutun, bride; and ]pa Oloru. The name Qja is not usually dropped when a girl grows up. It is usual to find aged women referred to as Eye'ja, mother Qja. But as depicted on masquerade headpieces, such names refer to princesses from the ritual community and not those who marry into it. The mother-with-child figure named QmQrubu, plump child, calls to mind the practice of naming a newborn child to reflect its physical state. In Ado Ekiti where I recorded this name, plump male boys are named JQnbu Uohn Bull !). In most cases, the name sticks even if the bearer wants to drop it. MQrubu (QmQrubu) is such a name, and if the bearer lives up to the earlier expectations of plump and beautiful, other women may wish to have children that resemble her. It is believed that a pregnant woman can bear babies which resemble her. It is also believed that a pregnant woman can bear babies which resemble whoever they constantly move close to during their gestation period. Consequently, even some educated women refuse to read children's comics, steer clear of museums of traditional art and deformed individuals. The name AbiamQ refers to nursing mother, a popular motif in Egungun</page><page sequence="7">J. R. 0. oJo 46I travelling theatres, providing the grand finale to performances by the entertainment sub-type of Egungun. The nursing mother is opposed to another motif observed in Ido, of a woman holding a baby upside down and named Olubankq, Lord take care of it for me. This motif typifies the jealous co-wife, possibly barren, or with no male children, the type of woman thought likely to harm co-wives' children. Qbutun, the new bride, may be shown carrying a special type of pot, oru, used for children's herbal decoctions. A related headpiece is named JFpa oloru, ]pa carrying a pot. This represents a woman carrying a baby on her back and another on her knee, with a pot on her head. Now, the Yoruba word ikoko refers to all pots in general, but oru is used almost exclusively in ritual contexts, except for another variety which is used in baby care as containers for herbal decoctions for bathing babies, and for feeding them. Women's anxiety about bearing children. Some women go to religious festivals in order to ask the deity being worshipped for children. Some go from one traditional deity to another both in their own ritual community and neighbouring ritual communities in order to offer gifts to deities believed to make women fruitful. Some drift from traditional deities to separatist churches, and to the various mission and university hospitals in order to be cured of their barrenness. Apart from the apparently impotent, most Yoruba men, even the educated elite, believe that it is the fault of the women if there are no children. In the ceremonies I watched (including those unconnected with ]pa), the women are the ones who pray and ask for children. One of the songs recorded by Carroll prays to 'the Spirit which came from heaven to earth . .. to grant that I may carry a baby on my back' (195 6: 13). The refrain in two of the songs which I recorded in Ido is 'Children are what I like (want).' In Odo Qra, GbQmQ a o QlQmQyQyQ 'Bring children (to us) owner of many children' is the only song that occurs twice, the second time as one of three songs which round off a five-day ceremony. In another town, after the masquerade has returned to the shrine at the end of the public ceremony, the women stay on to sing seven songs. One of these asks for increase in wives, children and pots of soup. It may seem strange that women should ask for increase in wives. But in the traditional setting, it is usual for the first wife to find a second and younger wife for her husband. For without this, unless her husband finds one himself, she cannot become iyaale (literally 'mother of the house'), senior wife. It is proverbial in Ado that a man with a large household, managing several wives and numerous children is the only one qualified by experience to become a chief and manage the affairs of the town. A song in another ceremony says 'We shall multiply like locusts'. This ties in directly with 'increase in children'. The 'increase in pots of soup' can be linked with fertility of land. Another song consists of sounds suggestive of playing with babies: E e e ku u bu, repeated several times. These onomatopoeic sounds are repeated after the ceremony by masked youths and children singing: Qmo kubu kubu, omo kurubu eusa omo Plump children, plump children like the bush rats'.</page><page sequence="8">462 J. R. 0. OJO (It is believed that the bush rat multiplies rapidly) QmQ kubu kubu, ma a yQ 9 gbe kurubutu pon Plump plump children, I can carry plump children on my back. From the consideration of some of the mother-with-children motifs, there is a lot to suggest that they can be regarded as fertility symbols. But this does not explain other motifs which occur in the ]pa masquerade complex. ]pa cannot therefore be regarded as^ concerned only with fertility. Apart from sculptural motifs, there is evidence from the ceremonies to show that ]pa- type masquerade headpieces are connected with other human problems and wishes. Since all Yoruba deities can give children to worshippers, to think of ]pa solely in terms of fertility will obstruct further analysis. Having examined the motifs connected directly and indirectly with human fertility, we will now examine motifs connected with war. Warrior and leopard motifs These are representations of equestrian figures, foot soldiers and leopards. It will be shown that the last motif is metaphorically connected with war. The first two motifs are variously named to convey the impression of warriors: Ologun (literally 'owner of war') and Jagunjagun (literally 'fight war fight war') both meaning 'warrior'; Ologun ma ja, 'warrior do not fight' (his own people), or do not be angry; and Ologun ba an ja, 'warrior fight them'. Other motifs are named Ogun, god of war. There is a direct link between these motifs and Ogun, the god of war after whom some of the headpieces in this group are named, and to whom offerings were made during some of the ceremonies. This link is strengthened by the participation of the warrior age grade carrying weapons of war, the names of the headpieces, singing of war songs, beating of war drums, and the playing of piccolos (vyv) and deer horn trumpets (ekutu). The last two instruments and the war drums were played in times past during battles. These days, they are used in these ceremonies and during Ogun festivals. They were also used in some places during the political riots of I965 and I966. These echoes of war in ]pa-type masquerade and other rituals in Ekiti (and Igbomina) can be regarded as reflections of the wars waged against the people of the area by various armies from as early as the sixteenth century to the closing years of the nineteenth century. Clarke (1937: 3-4) observed that Ekiti and Igbomina territory lay between Fulani horsemen from the North, and coastal peoples armed with European weapons. He did not link this with the representation on ]pa masquerade headpieces of horsemen and soldiers with bound and gagged figures. Nor did he link the invasions with the participation of the warrior age grade in ceremonies during which sacrifices were made to Ogun, the god of war by the actors who had left their original settlements because of the wars (Clarke 1944: 91). Carroll and Rubin did. Wthile the latter (quoted by Armstrong 1971: 42) suggested that the struggle for the control of the territory by Benin, Qyo and Nupe is dramatically represented in the group of closely related masking rituals grouped under the name ]pa (I969: 36); Carroll wrote that the artist in representing the life around him, recorded attacks by hostile</page><page sequence="9">J. R. 0. OJO 463 groups. Artists like Areogun in 'sympathetically reporting everyday life' left records of raiders on horseback from the North (Fulani, Nupe and Ilorin); Yoruba (QyQ and later Ibadan) warriors with broad swords, bows, arrows, and basket work shields (I967: 79). Ekiti and Igbomina territory was overrun by invaders from the fifteenth century onwards, when Benin troops are said to have first entered Ekiti. By the sixteenth century, they had penetrated as far as Qtun which then reached a friendship agreement with Benin, and acted as a buffer between the QyQ and Benin empires (Akintoye 1971: 26; Lloyd I962: 58). In later years, the area suffered most from the raids by IlQrin and Ibadan forces. The former, after an unsuccessful attempt to drive south, attacked northwestern parts of Ijqsha, Ekiti and Igbomina territory. The Ibadan forces later expelled IlQrin and their Fulani allies, thus assuming control over the whole territory. But the liberators soon turned oppressors. By I840, Ibadan soldiers were foraging through Ekiti and Igbomina territory into Akoko territory, up to the border with Nupeland where according to Johnson, they came face to face with Nupe cavalry whose 'cavaliers were described as seated erect on powerful horses, their spears . . . of burnished brass . .. glittered in the noon-day sun' (1921: 404-5). Johnson's flowery prose brings to mind some of the equestrian superstructures on ]pa-type masquerade headpieces. This type of subject matter may be regarded as records of invaders. Jagunjagun, and Ologun, warrior, as depicted on houseposts and door panels can be regarded as records of war. But why should such representations appear on masquerade headpieces used in ceremonies designed to solicit help from the gods? I suggest that this is ritual role reversal. As outlined by Turner (I969: 172-4) (following Anna Freud), this involves identification with the negative forces that threaten one. This identification results in replacement, the drawing off of power from a stronger being in order to weaken that being. This, he went on, amounts to a species ofjujitsu: you identify with the object that threatens you, and draw off its power to work in your own defence. Not only were the Ekiti and Igbomina at the receiving end of these invasions, but they did not have horses. Therefore, as a species ofjujitsu, the longer name of the warrior motifs Ologun ban anja, warrior fight them, can be explained as a wish that Epa should help the Ekiti to fight their enemy. The words Ologun ba anja occur in a song whose refrain is Fran gni l'Vkun UV. 'The leopard eats its owner's prey'. A direct analogy is often made between the leopard which the Yoruba regard as king of the savannah, and the human king. An analogy can also be made between its fighting attributes and the fighting qualities the performers wish for. This might explain the pre- eminence of the headpiece named Oloko, leopard, at Omu, a town which according to Clarke (1944: 91) was broken up during the nineteenth century. There is no contradiction in this double usage of the leopard as a metaphor for warrior, for as Gombrich remarked (I965: 12-13) in the case of the lion, allusion can be made in one context to its nobility, and in another context to its ferocity. Each quality is isolated and transferred to another object. The headpiece named Ologun maja, 'warrior do not fight', can be explained in two ways. First, it can be explained as a prayer that the foreign invaders</page><page sequence="10">464 J. R. 0. OJO should not attack the Yoruba. On the other hand, it can be explained as an entreaty to Epa not to be angry with his people. Some Yoruba deities can be capricious if not properly propitiated. Eshu, the trickster, and Shango, 'god of thunder and lightning', are two examples. But the closest parallel to my explanation here is that of Ogun, god of war after whom headpieces similar to Ologun, warrior, are named. In an angry moment, Ogun was said to have slain his own people in Ire, an Ekiti town said to be his burial place. An elaborate Ogun festival takes place here during which IVpa-type masquerade headpieces are used. Some headpieces with equestrian superstructures are named Ogun. In Ilawq, such a headpiece was said to have helped their ancestors to victory in the intertribal wars. In Igbole, a headpiece with no iconic superstructure is referred to as a war masquerade. This is supported by the legend connected with its usage (Ojo 1974: 74-5, 77); mimetic acts, songs, use of war drums, musical instruments, the active participation of hunters and the warrior age grade carrying weapons of war which are clearly relics of the nineteenth- century wars. In Ayetoro (Iyapa), the participants include men carrying shields with which they defended themselves against mystical forces represented by the masquerade which attempted to touch them with certain ritual objects (Ojo 1974: 138-9). It could be said that although there are no more wars, the town still has to be defended against mystical forces represented or contained in the objects with which the masker attempted to hit the shield carriers who are of the same age as the warrior age grade in other towns. At another level, the ceremonies are re-enactments of historical events. In IlQfa, the principal participants included Egbq Ologun, a company of warriors (Clarke 1944: 93) who led a fire-branding dance. Some of the songs, one of which says 'the fire brands have come; the wicked Qfa are coming; the Ifq are coming', lead one to the conclusion that the participants may have been dramatising what Carroll has described as the dry season raids when whole villages were burnt down by invaders (I967: 79). The town of Qfa lies to the north of IlQfa and was an ally of IlQrin which in turn was an ally of the Fulani. Ifq on the other hand was on the side of Ekiti against Ibadan which at one time during the wars occupied Ifq. The distance of Ifq from IlQfa, and the fact that Modakqkq, close to Ifq, and occupied by Yoruba refugees displaced by incursions from the north, was an ally of Ibadan might have led IlQfa people to regard Ifq as enemy. It is unnecessary to go into the intricacies of the alliances and counter- alliances formed between the various warring factions during the nineteenth century. It is enough to mention here that, about the year I 847, Qtun sought the help of Ibadan troops in subduing Aye, a tributary town of Qtun which, with the help of IlQrin, rebelled against Qtun. Qtun's ally, the Ibadan forces, won. The inhabitants of Aye sought refuge in Ekan and Omuaran. The Ibadan forces gave chase, Ikan, Omuaran and IlQfa fell. By I848, lyapa (Ayetoro), Ushi and other towns fell into Ibadan's hands. In that year, the combined forces of Ibadan and IlQrin, which have by then changed sides, raided Ifon (Akintoye I97I: 43-7, 5 I, 65-8) after which EI1fon headpieces are</page><page sequence="11">J. R. 0. OJO 465 said to have been named (Carroll I956: 7; OjO I974: 98). Because of this chain of catastrophic events, it is perhaps not surprising that in towns such as Omuaran, the ceremonies should include sacrifices to Ogun, the god of war; and that in other towns such as lyapa (Ayetoro), Igbole and others, the warrior age grades should participate prominently in some of the ceremonies. In further support of this suggestion, according to Clarke (I944: 9I), IVpa festival in Omuaran is performed by descendants of fugitives from Qra, a town which with Ila and IlQfa was sacked by Ibadan and their IlQrin allies on November i, I878 (Akintoye I97I: ioo). The opening rites of the festival in Omuaran includes firing of guns by the hunters. This takes place at the site of their original settlement. A sacrifice to Ogun, the god of war, rounds off the festival. Although headpieces with mother with children and warrior motifs are used there, the principal headpiece was the one bearing a leopard motif (Clarke I944: 9I). The reasons for this were suggested earlier on; in other parts of Yorubaland, leopard skins form part of the costume of the war leader. I have observed it in use in a religious ceremony at Ikirun which was the headquarters of the Ibadan garrison in their effort to put down the Ekiti uprising. It has been mentioned earlier that Benin troops were also active in Ekiti as early as the sixteenth century. It is difficult to document Benin connexions with Ekiti except through artefacts with Benin affinity such as bronze bells which are used in some of the ceremonies. These bells are found in parts of southern Nigeria which were linked with Benin.7 In Fpa-type ceremonies, they are slung over the masker's shoulders or tied to the edge of the headpiece. The latter was the case in the town where I was told that bronze bells and other objects similar to those from Benin were made in Obo, a tributary town of Otun. In their military campaigns in Ekiti, it was never attacked by Benin whose craftsmen may have settled there, as Benin political agents often do. The headpiece on which such a bronze bell was tied was said to have been carried away by raiders from Ikqrq where a section of the town is named after the town from which the headpiece was allegedly taken. This story has some basis in fact. Ikqrq people acted as vanguards for Benin troops in their military campaigns in Ekiti. Inhabitants of whole towns were carried away and resettled in Ikqrq, which after Akurq, acted as an outpost for Benin armies (Akintoye: personal communication). Other equestrian motifs. At Igbara Odo, an Ipa-type headpiece with an equestrian superstructure is named Olua, a deity whose rites are in some respects similar to that of Oro, an ancestral cult. In Ado Ekiti, another headpiece with an equestrian motif represents the king of Ado who was said to have been a prince from Ifq, believed to be the origin of all Yoruba people. The ceremony in which it is used overlaps that of Ogun, the god of war, but is not connected with it. It is connected with the rites of Qbalufon, the deity of good and peaceful government. One is tempted here to see an opposition between the disruptive nature of war epitomised by Ogun; and peace, personified by Qbalufon, said to have been once a king of Ifq. He reigned peacefully to a ripe old age, and was</page><page sequence="12">466 J. R. 0. OJO deified. Such an opposition is in a way historicallyjustified. It was not that Ado was not involved in war. It was menaced by Benin and later Ibadan armies; and repulsed the Nupe around IkQle (Akintoye I97I: 204). But Ado did not send contingents to the Ekiti Confederate army camp at Kiriji. The refusal of the Ado general to lead his troops against Ibadan may be because he was admitted to the Ogboni cult as a prisoner of war in Ibadan (Akintoye I97I: 93). Perhaps Ado did not feel immediately threatened because it was far away from the defenders at Kiriji camp. Although her southern neighbours were none too friendly so that she could ill afford to send the militia away, it could also be that after taking practical measures such as stationing troops at the town gates, her masking rituals were then directed to other ends. I was informed by the keeper of the set of Epa headpieces (of which that representing the king is one) that chief AkQgun of the same quarter as the keeper was stationed in that section of the town to prevent incursions by people of Ilawq. The issues raised in the above paragraph bring me to Firth's remarks about the manner in which people solve their problems. Some problems, he wrote, are solved in a straightforward pragmatic manner. People may also combine two types of solutions (I964: I74). It could be said of the Ekiti and the Yoruba in general, that religious rituals are not ends in themselves but preludes to the pragmatic or technical solution of problems. For them then, such rituals are not therefore magic formulae for the solution of problems. It is recognised that performing rituals in order to seek help from superhuman entities is one thing, and seeking a rational solution is another. It may be mentioned in this connexion that there was a shrine to Ogun, the god of war, in the Ekiti camp at Kiriji, but in addition to ritual protection they also arranged to procure European firearms from their countrymen resident in Lagos.8 It is now time to consider motifs based on Qsanyin, the god of medicine in whose rituals one finds the combination of both spiritual and technical solutions to problems. Motifs based on Qsanyin, the god of medicine Apart from the representation of Qsanyin and Qsanyin priests on Ipa-type masquerade headpieces, Qsanyin priests take part in some of the Epa-type masking rituals; musical instruments and drum beats associated with Qsanyin are used. But most important, as in other rituals of this area, 'magical' objects which cannot be made without the help of Qsanyin are found in the ceremonies. On Ipa-type masquerade headpieces, the priest of Qsanyin is depicted holding an iron staff ornamented with birds and bells in one hand; and in the other, an antelope horn stuffed with oogun, medicine. Qsanyin is believed to be responsible for the efficacy of all plants and other ingredients-animal, vegetable or mineral-used in the preparation of oogun. Oogun embraces all medicinal preparations, charms, amulets either harmful or otherwise; and all substances believed to be necessary for the control of ashe, ritual power of the gods (cf. Verger I954: I69-70).</page><page sequence="13">J. R. 0. OJO 467 The horn depicted in the figure's hand represents ivo ashy, horn of ritual power, usually held by priests in such cults as Qsanyin. It is depicted in the hands of the figure on an Epa headpiece in Odo Qra. In Ado, the headpieces are kept near oju ashc, face of ritual power, where offerings are made before the headpieces are paraded round the town. In Ido, the ashf, ritual power, of the masquerades is kept in a brief-case, a substitute for the locally made leather bag, apo oogun medicine bag, normally used. This practice is found in Ifa, Qsanyin, AgqmQ and other cults in which potent medicines are used. Also in Ido, one of the songs connected with the performance says: Ashc 1lfshida, ritual power of the original creator. But Ilqshida is also the Ifq equivalent of Qsanyin. The masquerades in Ido are also addressed as o r'eru ogigun, the carrier of medicine, and ao (standard Yoruba awo), priest. The word refers to both the priests of Qsanyin and Ifa. Both types of priests are among the principal participants. In Ayetoro, there is Eigun'sayin, Qsanyin masquerade. This appears two months after the appearance of Epa and related group of masquerades. During the appearance of Okotorosho, one of the latter, Qsanyin drums and drum rhythms accompany the dances. The masker uses an iron staff ornamented with bird and bells as a walking stick. At certain points during the ceremony, he sits on a cylindrical bark box identical to those used as containers for sacred emblems and objects by the higher grade of Ifa priests. He also engages in ritual combat with the warrior age-grade using ritually charged objects which had been placed in a medicine pot before the ceremony. The bird on the staff is called Eyq Qsanyin, Qsanyin's bird. Its presence on Ifa staffs is believed to make the Ifa priests' medicinal preparations efficacious. Apart from divining, the Ifa priest might also be a compounder of charms and medicines. But some Ifa priests refer their clients to an Qsanyin priest after diagnosing the clients' trouble. The Qsanyin priest cannot prepare any medicine without the help of Qsanyin. It is suggested that the representation of themes associated with Qsanyin, the god of medicine, on Ipa-type masquerade headpieces is a way of emphasising the attribute of Epa as giver of physical and spiritual health and welfare. It is also suggested that the representation of Ogun, the god of war, and Oshun believed to be benevolent in giving children to devotees, is a way of emphasising and pin-pointing the attributes of this group of masquerades as defender of the people and the giver of children. III Conclusion This article started from the notion prevalent in some circles that Epa is concerned only with fertility, and went on to show that Epa is concerned with at least two other human aspirations, namely, victory in war (at least in the past) and good health. It seems to me that those who characterised Epa as a fertility cult based their conclusions on the title of Clarke's (I944: 9I-6) 'Three Yoruba fertility ceremonies' of which Epa was one. Other writers have echoed this conclusion without reading Clarkes' account closely, if at all. Fagg (I95I: ii6; Fagg &amp; Eliosofon I958: II4) wrote that the purpose of the Epa</page><page sequence="14">468 J. R. 0. OJO ceremony is fertility and well-being of the community. Now, while 'well- being' broadly interpreted, might extend beyond fertility to include good health, this has never been explicitly stated. One suspects that this notion of fertility is one of the basis of Fagg's hypothesis that 'aspects of the concept of increase provide the subject matter of masks', and he has repeatedly defended this concept of increase (I963: I22-4; I973: I66; I975). Wassing is one of the authors who, using secondary sources, mixed up Gqlqdq and Epa masquerade headpieces and wrote: 'The gqlqdq masks of Ekiti . . . are . .. used for the Epa cult . . . intended to ensure fertility of the land and well-being of mankind', and went on to describe a 'mounted warrior, jagunjagun' as a 'symbol of fruitfulness' (I970: I36). Roach, also using secondary sources, described the figure on an Ipa-type masquerade headpiece as having an 'implacable expression and fecundity of form which reflects the principal goal of the Epa cult, that of increase both of land and man' (I972: 65). An obsession with a fertility notion has prevented writers from seeking explanations for the occurrence of other sculptural motifs apart from the mother and child figures. For example, Fagg saw nothing more than the wish to show dancing warriors in the representation of equestrian motifs. This is inadequate, as has been shown here, and it has also been demonstrated that headpieces named Oloko, leopard, are in the same group and serve the same purpose as the warrior motifs. As Fagg himself observed, dogs are sacrificed to Oloko headpieces (I95I: i i6). This confirms my suggestion of their association with war, for in another context, dogs are the sacrificial animals of Ogun the god of war, and no other deity. That the fighting attributes of the leopard were desired has been confirmed by the performers in what Clarke referred to as an 'ingenious account': 'the leopard has claws and teeth with which to fight and that they are better than horns and teeth' (I944: 9I). A critical examination of Clarke's 'Three Yoruba fertility ceremonies' will show that only one of them is an Epa ceremony. One is a ceremony that involves the use of Ipa-type headpieces, whilst another is a religious ceremony which, as has been shown elsewhere, contains elements which are similar to those found in an Ipa-type masquerade ceremony in Ayetoro (Ojo I974: I37, I54). In passing, the conclusion reached by Ucko about the association of fertility with certain prehistoric figurines is applicable to Ipa-type masquerade headpieces. He suggested that the association of fertility with these figurines is usually assumed, although the nature of the association (like that of Epa) is rarely specified. The figurines are 'simply taken as symbolizing fertility although the actual nature of the fertility varies from a general all-embracing fertility of animals, humans and vegetation to a specifically human fertility' (I962: 39). As with Ucko's prehistoric figurines, the supposed fertility notion in Clarke's I944 material has been transferred to all Epa (cf. Ucko I962: 43). I have tried to show that this is not so. Conclusions deduced from one group of headpieces cannot be transferred to all Epa (cf. Ucko I962: 45). An ill-defined concept of fertility and increase leaves several other equally important headpieces unexplained. It is best as Ucko suggested, to interpret each figure</page><page sequence="15">J. R. 0. OJO 469 or group of figures in its own right and to avoid generalising from one group of Ipa to all Ipa in general (cf. Carroll I956: 5). Like the figurines discussed by Ucko, 'It is likely that many different reasons lay behind their manufacture and their usage' (I962: 47). I have kept the lesson contained in this sentence to the fore in my examination of the significance and symbolism of the three sets of Fpa-type masquerade headpieces found among the Ekiti and Igbomina Yoruba of Nigeria. NOTES This is the revised version of a paper presented before the Art Panel of the Royal Anthropological Institute on I2 March, I974. Presented as 'The form and content of some Ekiti Yoruba masquerade headpieces'; it was the initial draft of the fourth and final chapter of an M.Phil. thesis presented to the University of London in August I974, and written under the supervision of Drs N. C. David and R. H. Layton, at that time both at University College London. 1 For the extent of Ibadan Empire see Akintoye I97I: 67. 2 A joint examination of some aspects of QyQ Yoruba ancestral masquerades by Chief Oludare Qlajubu and me has been accepted for publication by Africa.

In Ilesha, there are more than four dry moats on the northern approach to the town. Dry moats are on the northern side of Ido, and on the southern end of Igbole, the direction from which the Ikere army allegedly entered the town. REFEREN CES Akintoye, S. A. I97I.
