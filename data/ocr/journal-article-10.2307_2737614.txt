<plain_text><page sequence="1">Associationism and Sensibility in Eighteenth-Century Architecture* G. L. HERSEY ARCHITECTURAL TREATISES often describe buildings as if they dealt in facts and emotions or even as if a building could be a sort of discoursing creature. As everyone knows, Vitruvius endowed the Orders, and entire buildings, with bodily and sexual qualities. He equated Doric with manliness, and with temples to Minerva, Mars, and Hercules; Ionic with matronliness, and with Juno, Bacchus, and Diana; and Corinthian with girlishness, and with Venus, Flora, the nymphs, etc.1 Thus one aspect of architecture was sexual, and another had to do with informing the observer. It is with these two aspects of architecture, mainly in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, that my article is concerned. Renaissance theorists increased the bodily and personality sym- bolism of which a building was deemed capable. Francesco di Giorgio's analyses of columns, and even whole facades, as statements about or even images of, immured human figures, are well known.2 To Filarete buildings could be even more anthropomorphic. They were in fact conceived in Adam's image and were to be considered as actual living men, he says, human in proportions and parts (Florence, Bib. Naz. Magl. II. I. 140, I, 6r) and even in their variety and distribution (1, 4r, 5v). Even ugliness and nondescriptness were as unavoidable in architecture as in the human race. Meanwhile the passive sexuality that buildings have in Vitruvius becomes, in Filarete, an erotic relationship between the patron and his creature: "Building is nothing * The illustrations to Professor Hersey's essay have been made possible by the generous support of The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art (London) Limited. 1 Dearchit.I,i,5;III,i,2-3;IV,i,6-11. 2 Henry Millon, "The Architectural Theory of Francesco di Giorgio," Art Bulletin, 40 (1958), 257-261; Gunter Hellmann, "Proportionsverfahren des Francesco di Giorgio Martini," Miscellania bibliothecaehertzianae, 16(1961), 157-166, 71</page><page sequence="2">72 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES else than a sensuous pleasure, as when a man is in love" (II. 8r).3 But Filarete also implies that these qualities, perceptions, and pleasures are felt only by the initiate, i.e. by those who had read his book and who could, while "reading" a building, be guided by his interpretations into the proper state of mind: "Think about my statements and under- stand them clearly," he says (I, 6r).4 The qualities that Filarete says exist in buildings are in this sense messages that have to be uncoded. They constitute intellectual and emotional information, as with Vitruvius, but this is greatly heightened in force and has much more specific, not to say idiosyncratic, meanings. In the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in Britain, such meanings would have been called associations, i.e. mental predispositions on the observer's part upon which the building had to act before its aesthetic value could be established. But this later British associationism was more akin to the way in which such qualities were sensed in architecture by certain eighteenth- century Frenchmen. For example here is Germain Boffrand in his Livre d'architecture (1745): An edifice, by its composition, expresses as on a stage that the scene is pastoral or tragic, that it is a temple or a palace, a public building destined to a specific use, or a private house. These different edifices, through their disposition, their structure, and the manner in which they are decorated, should announce their purpose to the spectator.5 Buildings are differentiated according to the requirements of a dramatic genre, as with the tragic and comic scenes of the Sienese sixteenth-century architectural vulgarisateur, Sebastiano Serlio. But 3 Filarete also (Trattato, I, 3v and 4r), measuring columns in terms of human heads, makes the tallest the equivalent of a giant, the next normal, and the squattest the equivalent of a small or dwarfish person. These three heights are then respectively Doric, Corinthian, and Ionic. As to relationships between one human with another (as opposed to the re- lationships between humans and buildings) Filarete in Book II, 7v likens an architectural patron to the father and the architect to the mother of a building, while the preliminary wooden model is a foetus. These references are all to the facsimile in the edition of Filarete's Treatise on Architecture edited by John Spencer (New Haven, 1965). 4 To mention only one of the many other Renaissance architects who indulged in such anthropomorphism, cf. Michelangelo's letter fragment in which he says architectural members derive from human ones and that he who cannot draw the figure cannot under- stand architecture (James Ackerman, The Architecture of Michelangelo. I [London, 1961], 1-8). 5 Germain Boffrand, Livre d'architecture (Paris, 1745), p. 16. For French architectural theory in general in these years see Louis Hautecoeur, Histoire de l'architecture classique en France, III (Paris, 1950), 457-476; IV (Paris, 1952), 44-69, E. Kaufmann, Three Revo- lutionary Architects (Philadelphia, 1952), pp. 436-453; and Wolfgang Herrmann, Laugier andEighteenth-Century French Theory (London, 1962).</page><page sequence="3">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 73 Boffrand applies the genres to actual architecture rather than to stage scenery, while at the same time a building's functional expression is much more specific. Boffrand then adds to this intellectual content by saying that architecture should also arouse emotions: joy, sadness, love, hate, even terror. These emotions, like the expression of function, must always be appropriate: anything else is "desordre."6 Under this rule many other emotions besides love or sexual attraction are genera- ted by buildings, and all sorts of observers, besides the patron, can be involved. As to the force of these ideas, they are no mere metaphorical garnish: Boffrand states that when they conflict with the traditional, purely formalist rules of architecture-symmetry, unity, etc.-the expressive rules shall prevail.7 Jacques-Frangois Blondel in his Cours d'architecture (1771) restates several of Boffrand's ideas but generally uses the word "character" to cover the latter's concept of the denotative and emotional charge on a building. A related concept is "convenance," which constitutes a more imperative functional expression than any- thing in Boffrand: "One says that a building has convenance when one has remarked that the exterior composition and the main parts of its decoration are absolutely relative to its purpose." Blondel also deals much more specifically than Boffrand with emotion, or emotionally felt qualities. Churches should cause emotions connected with decency (i.e. decorum), royal palaces with magnificence, public buildings with grandeur, fortifications with solidity.8 Then too Blondel discusses style in a novel manner, showing how it must vary to accommodate content. In this it clearly stems from Boffrand's ideas about expressive genres, but once again Blondel makes a more detailed message possible: In all the productions of architecture, the style proper to the project is one of the first merits of art. It is through style that the genre chosen is regulated in accordance with the building's function. Style, in the arrangement of fagades and decoration of apartments, constitutes the poetry of architecture: a coloration contributing to the true interest of an architect's compositions. It is style, appropriate to different ends, that leads to this infinite variety 6 Boffrand,Livre,p. 9. 7 Ibid., p. 10. Like Vitruvius Boffrand places the Orders within a spectrum of expressive values. But now, not only are they grave (as Doric), delicate and feminine (as Ionic) and magnificent (Corinthian); in their ascent from a building's basement to its attic, according to their normal superimposition-Doric, Ionic and Corinthian-they form a variety of genres running from rustic to sublime. (Livre, p. 24). 8 J. F. Blondel, Cours d'architecture, I (Paris, 1771), 389-390. Cf. also II (Paris, 1771), 229-232.</page><page sequence="4">74 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES among various types of buildings. In a word, style as defined here, like the style of eloquence, enables the architect to create a sacred genre, a heroic one, a pastoral one: there is no doubt that, aided by the rules, by reason, and by taste in art, one can achieve the true style which assigns to each edifice its proper character, and indeed only thus can one produce masterpieces.9 Thus style becomes the individuality of each structure, the personal concatenation of its emotional force and intellectual content. In line with this greater diversification and emotional energy, there is for Blondel a wider sexual force in a building. Not merely does he sense maleness in Doric and so forth, or a sexual metaphor in the patron's attitude; Blondel sees sexuality as permeating the whole structure. Buildings that consist of "rectilinear masses," such as the Luxembourg, Maisons-Lafitte, and the Portal of Saint-Gervais, are male. Conversely female architecture, made up of "sinuous partis," is characteristic of fountains, villas, baths, and the like (Fig. 1).10 Blondel's ideas on intellectual, emotional, and sexual expression seem to have influenced his pupil Ledoux. The designs in Ledoux' Architecture considerJe sous le rapport de l'art, des moeurs et de la legislation (1789/1804) are unique plastic odes. "Variety," he says, "gives to each edifice the physiognomy proper to it, and multiplies and changes this physiognomy in accordance with the surroundings, and with the sweep of land to the horizon, and from one satisfied desire innumerable others blossom.""l As with Filarete this variety is like that of individuals in a population. And not only do buildings have sexuality; for Ledoux, the force or presence that bestows that attribute-i.e., decoration, something like Blondel's convenance- also has it: ... This clever coquette, aided by the sweet arts of civilization, plays all roles; she is alternatively severe or easy, sad or gay, calm or passionate. Her attitude imposes or seduces; she is jealous of all, can support no 9 Blondel, Cours, IV (Paris, 1773), liv-lv. 10 Blondel, Cours, I, 411-413; 419-421. Cf. also I, 373-447, where he speaks of architec- ture that is sublime, or soul-raising, and the emotions that must go with this. For Blondel see especially Robin Middleton, "Jacques-Francois Blondel and the 'Cours d'archi- tecture."' Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, 18 (Dec. 1959), 140-148. Blondel's ideas also lead directly to lesser writers who discuss the impact of architecture on sensibility. Cf. for instance Nicolas Lecamus de Mezi6res (1721-1789), Le G6nie de l'architecture, ou l'analogie de cet art avec nos sensations (Paris, 1780) where Doric is a nobly-shaped man, Ionic a beautiful matron, Corinthian an elegant and slender girl (p. 22). The latter work was kindly brought to my attention by Philip Foster. For further writings on this period cf. the bibliography in the recent University of St. Thomas (Houston, Texas) Catalogue, Visionary Architects (1968). 11 Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, L'Architecture consideree sous le rapport de l'art, des moeursetdela lgislation (Paris, 1804), p. 10.</page><page sequence="5">x~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. ........ -t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:t K~~~~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ------------- ------- . o r R ! ,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~..... .... .

Ceaselessly surrounded with desires that align themselves with her radiance, she isolates herself from the world.12 Such a building is a focus, attracting meanings from its setting and then irradiating the observer's mind with them. Nor is the variety of emotional and cognitive expression in a building now limited to simple types, churches or halls of justice, as with Blondel. It is an infinitely capable language. Buildings may take any shape appropriate to their function or-to use a more appropriate word-dramatic role. Serlio's stage with its three genres has become the world, a wider stage that can support a complete variety of dramatic expression. For Ledoux the main function of all this is to supervise and reform human behavior. Buildings are machines to channel and define activity, to raise the appropriate intentions in the soul, to exert the necessary charm or issue a summons for the good conduct of society: The character of monuments, like their nature, serves the propaga- tion and the purification of manners. In one place theatres are raised under the progressive form which levels humanity; in another there are arches of triumph, which deify it; further on are cemeteries, where it is engulfed."'13 Ledoux in his almost surrealist architectural designs fashions appliances intended first to create knowledge and then to produce the emotions needed to act on that knowledge. This I think explains the strange shapes of his buildings, from the sawyers' villa with its log columns to the famous Oikema, the temple for communal love-litur- gies shaped in plan like an erected penis with testicles, surrounded by a great circle of maisonettes (Fig. 2); or to the house for the supervisor of the Loule irrigation system (Fig. 3), which is like a giant slice of pipe set into a stepped plinth with the waters rushing through it. The house of the directors of waters itself directs waters, serving as a continual example-indeed majestic, didactic; "example is the most powerful of lessons."'14 Even Ledoux' less extraordinary conceptions, like some of the custom houses or "propylees" for Paris, are similarly formed around embodied functions. The arch swallows, the gabled parallelepiped processes, the wings store, the back expels (Fig. 4). Ledoux says these propylees should have the illusionism of the theatre, and much diversitv of form. Thus some boast tranhies of victorv. while 12 Ibid.,p. 12. 13 Ibid.,p. 3. 14 Ibid., p. 2.</page><page sequence="14">76 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES others are "transplanted mountains," etc.; and this diversity in turn "raises the thirst of desire," summoning the observer's emotion to aid his public-spiritedness.15 Ledoux' designs are accompanied by ecstatic prose descriptions, a kind of poetry of architecture (to use Blondel's phrase).'6 Ledoux not only creates, in the building, the object of our thoughts and feelings; he tells us in literary form what those thoughts and feelings ought to be. He purposely commits the intentional fallacy and asks us to do the same. His reference to the architect as one who describes buildings may be taken in two senses-that his designs are descriptions or reevocations of earlier works by others, and also that the architect should write about his designs, explaining them and "raising the soul of the reader." 17 I will call this phenomenon, which becomes so common later on, "poetic feedback." Feedback is the reintroduction into a given system of a part of its original output. This reintroduction results in a second output, dependent on the first but usable in a different way, opposed to the original, in fact, and monitoring or controlling it. Ledoux' verbal descriptions of his designs function in this way. The design itself, including Ledoux' description, constitutes the output. This out- put, on being apprehended by the observer, is split: he takes in the object itself visually, and at the same time checks it against the description. He understands both fully only when the check is over. In other words, the description guides the reader as to how he is to perceive the object, yet that perception remains a part of the object. An example is the conduit house (Fig. 3), whose unusual shape and siting would normally provoke a considerable emotional reaction-of surprise, at least-on the observer's part. But there is nothing about the object itself, divorced from its nest of explanatory and hortatory prose, that tells the observer about the artist's precise intention. This can be grasped only by reading Ledoux' book: The abundant rivers of Olympia liberate the space wherein their fruits and treasures may be channelled through numerous tubes.... Already the torrents of the earth fill it up, and abundance floods the fields transformed with water.... Neptune awakes, and constructs for his children, on these humid rocks, a palace of supervision that will be cleansed by art.18 Only from this description can we know the purpose of the building or its metaphoric and actual relation to the irrigation system. Only 15 Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, L'Architecture consideree sous le rapport de l'art, des moeurs et de la lgislation (Paris, 1804), pp. 17-18. 16 Blondel, Cours, IV, liv. 17 Ledoux, Architecture, p. 16. 18 Ibid., p. 51.</page><page sequence="15">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 77 from the description do we see its true relation to its landscape setting, that of a begetter; only from the description do we see the appropriate- ness of this mechanical channelling of natural rivers; or fancy the inhabitants of the house as Neptune's offspring and, more elaborately, dwell on the likeness between Ledoux' art and that of the hydraulic engineers, a likeness symbolized by the waters. On reading the des- cription we reinject it into the structure, as it were, and adjust our reaction to the physical forms by means of Ledoux' words. As a result, we too become part of the system, for we initiate the feedback's reverse flow. Nor is there any reason why, now that he is part of the system, an observer cannot originate feedback on his own, in addition to, or even replacing, that of the artist. This indeed is one way of understanding the function of art criticism in this period.19 Other "revolutionary architects," besides Ledoux, held similar opinions. Boullee writes: "Our buildings, above all the public buildings, ought in some fashion to be poems. And the images they offer to our senses must excite in us sentiments analogous to the functions to which the buildings are devoted."20 Throughout his manuscript Boullee provides poetic feedback a la Ledoux to accompany his designs.2' He also suggests that buildings possess a physiognomic or anthropomorphic being, as with Ledoux, and imagines that beauty in objects does not come from innate qualities but from understanding their resemblance to our own bodies.22 19 In associationism, as we shall see, feedback is the articulated reaction of a spectator to a work of art. This reaction is guided by the art work. In this sense the reaction modifies the work, i.e. by conditioning how it is perceived. But still in this sense, the feedback may even consist of a second, resultant work of art-a poem, a piece of prose, or even another work in the same medium. Thus is Raphael's portrait of Maddalena Doni in the Pitti Palace "feedback" to the Mona Lisa or to certain Leonardesque innovations in the Florentine portrait tradition of the early sixteenth century. In a different way Botticelli's Calumny of Apelles is feedback, for it is based on a description of an earlier painting; in still another way a sculpture of a Spinario is feedback, for it too, as a replication, assumes the prime object as part of its behavior and performance. A poem such as Keats's Ode on a Grecian Urn is also feedback, i.e. a reaction to a work of art, real, imagined, or per- haps composite, which then becomes in itself a work of art. For feedback in a larger (but not artistic) sense see Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics; or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (Cambridge, 1948). For applications of Wiener's ideas, and of information theory generally, to art, see Max Bense, Theorie der Texte: eine Einfiihrung in neuere Auffassungen und Methoden (Cologne, 1962). Abraham A. Moles, Theorie de l'information etperception esthdtique (Paris, 1958) is mainly about music. 20 Etienne-Louis Boullee in Helen Rosenau, ed., Boullee's Treatise on Architecture (London, 1953), p. 26. 21 Usually under the rubric of "caractere." His talk of "the poetry of architecture" however seems to mean something more like utpicturapoesis than feedback as I define it through Ledoux. 22 Boullee, Treatise, p. 34, quoting Locke: .... toutes nos idWes, toutes nos perceptions, ne nous viennent que par les objets ext6rieurs. Les objets ext6rieurs font sur nous differ- entes impressions par les plus ou le moins d'analogie qu'ils ont avec notre organisation."</page><page sequence="16">78 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES I do not know if these French notions were consciously borrowed by English theorists in the early nineteenth century or not. But in Britain the Picturesque movement was already producing its own preliminaries to associationism, though paradoxically these were less marked than in France. Nevertheless, beginning as early as Reynolds23 and continuing with Richard Payne Knight,24 Uvedale Price, and others, certain writers do discuss informational, emotion-arousing architecture. Thomas Whately, in his Observations on Modern Gardening (1777), speaks of buildings primarily as adjuncts to land- scape, but endows them nevertheless with affective powers. The same structure which adorns as an object, may also be expressive as a character ... it may be grave, or gay; magnificent, or simple ... [Buildings] raise and enforce a character already marked: a temple adds dignity to the noblest, a cottage simplicity to the most rural scenes; the lightness of a spire, the airiness of an open rotunda, the splendor of a continued colonnade, are less ornamental than expressive: others improve cheerfulness into gaiety, gloom into solemnity, and richness into profusion.25 Whately also stresses the informational role of ornament, e.g. statues and inscriptions, and of mythological and historical paintings. But these, he says, are emblematic rather than expressive in the best sense, since they require examination and reflection on the part of the obser- ver. Through the imitation of familiar shapes, on the other hand, communication can be more direct; and what he calls "original" character is best of all, for this requires no discussion or discernment: the message is understood instantaneously.26 But any understanding of Picturesque writing as a form of feedback can at best be vague. On the other hand. these writers' well-known emphasis on variety Boullee adds more simply that beautiful objects are those we feel to be most like ourselves. At this point one must raise the related question of architecture parlante, a concept at- tributed to Ledoux by the Magasin pittoresque, 20 (1852), 388. Architecture parlante means making buildings symbolize their occupants in some direct way, as when wine- makers live in a cask-shaped house. Apparently there were still adherents of this doctrine in 1852. For the more general question of "Revolutionary Architecture" and its theories see Peter Collins, Changing Ideals in Modern Architecture, 1750-1950 (London, 1965), pp. 21-28. I must thank Professor Collins for the information about the Magasin pitto- resque. 23 See especiallyDiscourses 8 and 13, and Idlerno. 82 (Saturday, 10 Nov. 1759). 24 However none of the main writings on Knight discuss associationism very much. Cf. J. J. Mayoux, Richard Payne Knight et la pittoresque (Paris, 1932); Nikolaus Pevsner, "Richard Payne Knight," Art Bulletin, 31 (1949), 293-320; and S. Lang, "Richard Payne Knight and the Idea of Modernity," in John Summerson, ed., Concerning Architecture: Essays on Architectural Writers and Writing Presented to Nikolaus Pevsner (London, 1968), pp. 85-97. For architecture and the Picturesque in general, see Collins, Changing Ideals, pp. 42-58. 25 Thomas Whately, Observations on Modern Gardening (new ed. London, 1801), pp. 69-70. 26 Whately, Observations, pp. 83-87.</page><page sequence="17">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 79 and even ugliness as positive qualities in architecture will be important in later associationism. In particular, Whately's emphasis on instant transmission of simple emotional and intellectual images or messages will reappear. Later associationism shared a good deal with these theories. None of the writers mentioned so far actually explained how buildings provided information or aroused emotion. The concept of poetic feedback, outlined above, can lead us to an understanding of this process. The explanation of it begins in a Scotch philosophical milieu, the Common Sense school that arose under the influence of Hume and Hutcheson and was developed by Dugald Stewart and Thomas Reid.27 This school's main treatise on aesthetics is the work of a fifth Scotchman: Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste (1790) by Archibald Alison.28 Like other Scotch rationalists Alison held that beauty is not in- trinsic to objects but exists in the mind of the beholder.29 On seeing a work of art a simple emotion-admiration or cheerfulness-grips him. Urged on by it, he makes mental associations, and if these are 27 The text of this article from here on, except for a few additions, appeared in Archi- tectural Review, 144 (August 1968) 89-92.

The Essays took on new importance with Francis Jeffrey's review in the Edinburgh Review, 18 (May 1811), 1-46. The ideas also reappear in the article "Beauty" in the 1815 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Supplement, 1816, s.v.), also by Jeffrey. Cf. also George Gilfillan, obituary of Alison, Hogg's Weekly Instructor, N.S. 2 (1849),193; C. Fedeles, Versuch ilberAlison's Aesthetik. Darstellung und Kritik.

For Alison, it should be said at the outset, the Picturesque was only a subdivision of the Beautiful, rather than an alternative aesthetic category (e.g. Essays, I, 23). He speaks here of the "beauty" of one's birthplace or of one's nursery or school. On the other hand the Sublime is a separate aesthetic category (e.g. the first essay, "Of the Nature and of the Emotions of Sublimity and Beauty").</page><page sequence="18">80 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES sufficiently numerous, well-related, and novel, the object to him is fully beautiful. Conversely if the associations do not come the object is not beautiful, at least not for that beholder.30 "Imagination" is the power of a given mind to call up the associations31 and "expression" the power of an object to evoke them.32 The purpose of education is to equip the minds of men with many potential associations, i.e. to develop imagination. The artist in turn must strive to create works that are as "expressive" as possible. Alison illustrates his theory copiously. Take, he says, an ordinary scene. By itself, as a mere collection of forms, it may be "little beauti- ful." But if we know it as "the residence of any person, whose memory we admire ... the delight with which we recollect the traces of their lives, blends itself insensibly with the emotions which the scenery excites; and the admiration which these recollections afford, seems to give a kind of sanctity to the place where they dwelt, and converts every thing into beauty which appears to have been connected with them." Similarly Runnymede is beautiful not so much because of its physical character as because of its history. The loveliness of the Valley of the Vaucluse really impresses us because Petrarch once lived there ;33 and the very Alps, no matter how sublime they may seem to the eye alone, are made more so by the knowledge that Hannibal marched across them.34 And what is it that constitutes that emotion of sublime delight, which every man of common sensibility feels upon the first prospect of Rome? It is not the scene of destruction which is before him. It is not the Tiber, diminished in his imagination to a paltry stream, flowing amid the ruins of that mag- nificence which it once adorned. It is not the triumph of superstition over the wreck of human greatness, and its monuments erected upon the very spot where the first honours of humanity have been gained. It is ancient Rome which fills his imagination. It is the country of Caesar, and Cicero, and Virgil, which is before him. It is the mistress of the world which he sees, and who seems to him to rise again from her tomb, to give laws to the universe. All that the labours of his youth, or the studies of his maturer age have acquired, with regard to the history of this great people, open at once before his imagination, and present him with a field of high and solemn imagery, which can never be exhausted. Take from him these associations, conceal from him that it is Rome that he sees, and how different would be his emotion !3s 30 Alison, Essays, I, 8-22. 31 Ibid., I, 5; 69-172, esp. 158-165. 32 Ibid., I, 289-294. 33 Ibid., 1 25. 34 Ibid., I, 27. 35 Ibid., I, 41-42.</page><page sequence="19">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 81 Such trains of associations match the poetic feedback of Ledoux and Boullee, though they are based on general historical knowledge rather than specific directions supplied by the designer. However, all this does not mean that Alison entirely ignores formalism. Indeed he speaks at length of the intrinsic "beauty of forms,"36 and apparently had a chaste and correct Neoclassical taste. But at the same time his aesthetic criteria were rigorously functional. Interior spaces, according to their shape and size, produce different emotional "characters" such as gaiety, simplicity, solemnity, grandeur, magnificence, and the like.37 So much is similar to Boffrand and Blondel. But the ability of the spaces to project the emotions is judged as machines are judged. Thus, says Alison, when we talk of beauty of proportion, or of related things such as scale and compo- sition, what we really do is ask whether the building is fit for its purpose, and whether that fitness is expressed. Without knowing the function of an object no real aesthetic judgment is possible: "we never discover the Proportion, until we previously discover the principle of the Machine, or the Means by which the End is produced." With a proper knowledge of function, on the other hand, any man can make a valid judgment.38 Thus, while Alison remained in his taste a Neo- classicist, his justifications of that style prepared the way for eclecti- cism and relativism. Alison was read throughout the Victorian period and frequently received credit for opening up these possibilities. Thus the Eclectic Magazine in 1849: "To Alison be the praise of first announcing, in a popular form, the astonishing conceptions, which had passed before for the reveries of half-insane poets and philosophers, that the universe is a great mirror to the mind of man ... and that, in contemplating the fairest scenes. we are ourselves half-creating their loveliness."39 36 Ibid., II, 56-205. 37 Ibid., II, 184-185. 38 Ibid., II, 126. Thus in ibid., I, xxvii, Alison says he will base his demonstrations on "common nature, and the experience of common men," ignoring the fine arts as direct evidence. But this is because the latter are imitations of nature, and the original ought to be studied before the thing derived from it. 39 George Gilfillan, obituary of Alison in Hogg's Weekly Instructor, N.S. 2 (1849), 193. Alison had considerable influence on English literature-e.g. Burns, Crabbe, Byron, and above all Keats. Cf. James R. Caldwell, John Keats' Fancy (Ithaca, 1945), pp. 51-89. Ian Jack, Keats and the Mirror of Art (Oxford, 1967), passim, talks not about Alison but about Keats's poetry as a sort of poetic feedback to works of the visual arts; cf. also Ren6 Wellek, A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950, I (New Haven, 1955), 112. For Alison and painting see Ralph N. Miller, "Thomas Cole and Alison's Essays on Taste," New York History (1956), pp. 281-299, with other bibliography. One should not ignore Alison's interpreters either-in Keats's case the role of Hazlitt is important, while Lord Jeffrey drew the full consequences of Alison's relativism in words anticipating the democratic rules of taste that prevailed throughout much of Victorian culture: "If things</page><page sequence="20">82 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Other authors developed similar ideas though less consistently than Alison. In 1805. Payne Knight40 stressed that a greater associational eloquence was possible with eclecticism than with stylistic purity: In the pictures of Claude and Gaspar, we perpetually see a mixture of Grecian and Gothic architecture employed with the happiest effect in the same building; and no critic has ever yet objected to the incongruity of it: for, as the temples, tombs, and palaces of the Greeks and Romans in Italy were fortified with towers and battlements by the Goths and Lombards in the middle ages, such combinations have been naturalized in that country; and are, therefore, perfectly in harmony with the scenery; and [are] so far from interrupting the chain of ideas, that they lead it on and extend it, in the pleasantest manner, through different ages, and successive revolutions in tastes, arts, and sciences.4' The same is true of Gothic castles that have been "grecianized" by moderns. A mixture of styles tells a rounder, more circumstantial story. Knight thus becomes one of the earliest to suggest that for informational purposes classic and medieval architecture can be mixed in the same building. By this means Gothic can become aes- thetically almost equal to classic. It even has certain superior virtues: it produced, says Knight, "effects more imposing. . . than are, per- haps, to be found in any other works of man."42 The corollary that Gothic was, because of its historical associations, the specifically Christian architecture, has often been credited to Pugin.43 However in 1815 Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck expressed the same idea at length. With her, in fact (as had not been true for Alison). associationism was chieflv moral and religious: are not beautiful in themselves, but only as they serve to suggest interesting conceptions to the mind then everything which does in point of fact suggest such a conception to any individual is beautiful to that individual; and it is not only quite true that there is no room for disputing about tastes, but that all tastes are equally just and correct, in so far as each individual speaks only of his own emotions." However Jeffrey adds that not all tastes are equally desirable or good (Edinburgh Review, 18 (May 1811), 43. See also Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, ed. J. Shawcross, II (Oxford, 1907), 222: ". . . in Alison etc., much has been said well and truly; but the principle itself is too vague for practical guidance- Association in philosophy is like the term stimulus in medicine; explaining everything, it explains nothing; and above all, leaves itself unexplained." 40 For Knight vs. Alison see Mario Rossi, ed., L'Estetica dell' empirismo inglese, II (Florence, 1944), 918-922. 41 Richard Payne Knight. An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste, 3rd. ed. (London, 1806), p. 157. For Knight's associationism see also ibid., pp. 94-312, which depends on Reid more than Alison. Knight's main intention is to displace Uvedale Price's more formalist Picturesque with an associational version. 42 Knight, Inquiry, p. 175.

From this point of view, inherent association becomes to us the basis of a system of correspondence between the external world and man's nature.44 Schimmelpenninck also took up the implications of relativism in Alison's theory, stressing that beauty and deformity are actually allied, since struggle against sin necessarily warps ideal form. She admired the forms of the Picturesque with her delight in the ruinous, the old, and the damaged, but she liked these qualities because they recorded the battle of the ideal against time and against man's van- dalistic nature. She constantly implies that buildings suffer, and triumph over their suffering to achieve a moral beauty that transcends and replaces any physical beauty that has been lost.45 In the 1830s the major developments involved functional rather than organic associationism.46 These are mainly the work of the noted horticulturist, John Claudius Loudon.47 As far as I know the theories of Boffrand, Blondel, Ledoux, and Boullee did not directly reach Loudon. Nevertheless he was nothing less than the founder of a systematic architectural associationism. And Loudon certainly did read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the ideas of the Picturesque theorists, including Whately and Schimmelpenninck; but by far the 44 Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck, The Principles of Beauty as Manifested in Nature, Art, and Human Character, with a Classification of Deformities, an Essay on the Tempera- ments, with Illustrations, and Thoughts on Grecian and Gothic Architecture (London, 1859; first published in 1815as A TheoryofBeautyandDeformity), p. 15. 45 Ibid., pp. 392-393. 46 For one more earlier associationist, cf.

C. Loudon and Architectural Associationism." My quotations are all from the London edition of 1863, edited and added to by Mrs. Jane Loudon, but with Loudon's 1833 essay on criticism intact. In his Architectural Magazine Loudon included articles that repeated the critical ideas of the Encyclopaedia (Architectural Magazine, 1 [1834], 49-53; 97-103; 145-147; 185-188; 217-222, etc.). But the Encyclopaedia remains the chief vehicle of his ideas: "It was said by the Times, of the Encyclopaedia . . . that 'no single work had ever effected so much in improving the arrangement and external appearance of country dwellings, generally,' and nothing that was ever said by that influential journal had in it greater truth" (The Builder, 1 [1843], 22). As to Loudon's sources, he gives these in full, and the associationists among them are all English; his main French author being Quatrem6re de Quincy. For the breakup of classical theory at this time, under the influence of Hume, Alison, and others, see Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (London, 1949), pp. 131-134.</page><page sequence="22">84 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES greatest influence was Alison. Loudon's Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture (1835) not only embodied most of Alison's ideas but went on to apply them in a very rational manner to archi- tectural design.48 Loudon believed that "expression of fitness for the end in view," i.e. Alison's principal associational criterion, was a supreme archi- tectural law. He went beyond this, however, and invented specific meanings for architectural elements, making associational symbols out of windows, doors, chimneys, etc., saying that these expressed truths about the building's interior, its purpose, the nature of its occupants, its relation to the surrounding landscape, and even its role in local and national life.49 Other information was communicated by stylistic ornament, i.e. by "expression of architectural style," but this is a less important mode of expression than that of fitness or use.50 These three criteria-fitness, the expression of fitness, and the ex- pression of style-are all that are needed for judging architecture. Loudon gives many examples of what he means. "In dwelling- houses," he says, "the expression of use is indicated, in a decided manner, in all cold countries, by their having a number of chimney tops or other outlets, for permitting the escape of smoke from separate fires." Windows and entrances are other functional symbols associated with domestic life. A cottage with one bedroom, a living room, and a closet ought to express these three facts by using windows of three appropriately different sizes. Windows can also express regularity or irregularity of floor level, the presence of stairs, and other aspects of the plan. Turrets and projections on the other hand express "com- modiousness and convenience; it being supposed that their object, in houses, is to supply closets and cabinets." Similarly "Porticoes, colonnades, verandas, and balconies are all expressive, more or less, of comfort and elegant enjoyment on the part of the occupant. . ." Comfort and elegant enjoyment may exist in an unarticulated building; but there is no beauty until these truths are expressed by irregular masses, varieties of materials, and irregular openings.51 Thus, through 48 Loudon lists Alison's Essays in his bibliography at the beginning of the Encyclopaedia and in pp. 1114-1122, the heart of his theoretical discussion, he restates Alison's ideas, with quotations, though also with allusions to Dugald Stewart (and see ibid., pp. 52-54). Cf. also Architectural Magazine, 1 (1834), 145-147 ("Architecture Considered as an Art of Imagination" [by the Conductor]). For Alison's influence in the arts generally, more has been traced in the U.S. than in Britain. Cf. Donald A. Ringe, "Kindred Spirits: Bryant and Cole," American Quarterly, 6 (1954), 233-244; Ralph N. Miller, "Cole and Alison"; Edward R.

Loudon illustrates the expression of fitness throughout the En- cyclopaedia. One finds it in a one-room cottage with an entry on the left and a wash-house on the right (Fig. 5). Here "fitness for the end in view" is proclaimed by the windows, door, and roof. By the varying of these the associations can be changed and the building made to express fitness for other purposes: "Remove the windows and chimney top, leaving the entrance opening without a door (Fig. 6), and it might be taken for a cattle shed and yard. Remove the roof, and replace the door (Fig. 7), and it might pass for a place of burial. Restore the glass windows, increase the height of the principal one, and replace the roof with a little alteration, adding on its summit a turret and bell (Fig. 8), and this structure might be mistaken for a chapel."52 In this way Loudon makes volumes, voids, and details tell the story. It is perhaps only coincidence, however, that his illustrations can recall some of Ledoux' (Fig. 4). Such associational statements must always be honest, says Loudon. "A barn disguised as a church would afford satisfaction to none but those who considered it as a trick. The beauty of truth is so essential to every other kind of beauty, that it can neither be dispensed with in art nor in morals."53 Here he runs directly counter to earlier Pictur- esque practice, in which disguise was so frequent. In the design of farmhouses and farm buildings a greater range of functional expression is required than with cottages. Loudon lays it down that in such groups the purpose of each building should be absolutely clear to the knowing eye.54 He seldom provides a complete reading for the farm complexes as he does for the cottages; but keeping his theory in mind, we can provide a sort of Common Sense, or prose feedback. Let us take the bailiff's house designed for a farm owned by Charles Barclay at Bury Hill, near Dorking. It was designed by John Perry of Godalming (Figs. 9-15),55 and was to be of sandstone with brick trim. In the perspective a tall: cross-gabled two-story block is shifted forward from the wider, squatter parallelepiped forming the rest of the building. With its acutely raked, pronged roof, its wide, three-light Tudor windows on the ground floor, with generous two-light windows above, we can easily believe that this part of the house contains an 52 Ibid., pp. 28-3 1. 53 Ibid., p. 1113.

Looking at the plan we see that this is true: it houses the parlor (Fig. lOc) and one of the four major bedrooms (Fig. lp). By the same token the porch (Fig. 9) is equally expressive of interior space, since it continues the deep slot of the hall and stairs (Fig. 10b), while the upper hall and a small bedroom (Fig. 1 Ig, m) are appropriately lighted, and truthfully made known on the exterior, by their smaller windows. There are more general symbolisms. The parts containing reception and living spaces are high-walled and shallow-roofed, with big windows and ornament. Work and storage spaces, on the other hand, are low-walled and high-roofed, with small windows or none, and without ornament. The storeroom (Fig. 10e), the pantry (Fig. 10d), and the scalding-room (Fig. 10g), are on the north side of the house. On the east, at the back, are the dairy proper (Fig. 10f), the drying room (Fig. 10h) and the oven (Fig. 10i). These latter, the most workaday of the rooms, are in their own separate lower mass with its separate roof. Rustic detailing prevails here, i.e. the revealed half-timbered structure and the tree-trunk columns of the drying porch (Fig. 14). The roof of this wing sweeps to the ground in an unequivocal gesture of humility (Fig. 13).56 Such associational expression is a moral duty in any building, but it is all the more necessary in buildings of a specifically moral nature, such as schools. "In the choice of a Situation for an infant school,"' says Loudon, "the first consideration is, the physical health of the children; and the next, their moral health." Designs by E. B. Lamb and others display these things clearly.57 In one design the sexes are physi- cally segregated by being at opposite ends of the building, each class- room with its own separate entrance porch with separate roof. Another part of the building literally performs this separation: a tall, contrasting mass containing the master's and mistress' quarters and infant school. This part of the building has a gable and balconied second-floor window, thus proclaiming itself at once domestic and watchful, while the infant school is included within, thrust behind- embraced as it were-by this master's and mistress' block. The whole grouping might be said to symbolize vigilance and innocence standing 56 The same principles are applied to model "farmeries," i.e. the whole complex of buildings arranged around courts. These indeed must have an even greater range of expression. And according to Loudon, here too we must be able to tell instantly what every part is for. The model farmery is thus a kind of treatise on itself, or as Loudon says it is designed to "embodyprinciples in tangible shape" (Encyclopaedia, p. 354). 57 Ibid., p. 727. The school design appears onpp. 757-758.</page><page sequence="25">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 87 between instinct and temptation: surely a good theme for the Age of Sensibility.58 We have seen that "the expression of architectural style" as he calls it is the least important of Loudon's three architectural principles. In fact he frequently denies that there is any need for it at all, since all questions of design are really matters of fitness and expression.59 For Loudon, style is an unserious makeshift, useful only until mass educa- tion on Common Sense principles rules it out. He shows this in a series of diagrams illustrating how a utilitarian cottage can be dressed up in different ornamental jackets (Figs. 16- 24).60 Normally the cottage consists of a cube with a hipped roof and central chimney. Its occupant is a shoemaker or some other craftsman who works in one room while his wife keeps house in the other (Figs. 16, 20). The smaller rooms are respectively a bedroom and a storage space. So much for the prose feedback: the building is sufficiently if not eloquently expressive of fitness. In order to enrich the meanings of this modest object, to add poetry to the prose, Loudon suggests that a false second story and roof be built out of trellis work (Fig. 18) which would be designed to resemble masonry joints. Fruit vines could then be grown over it, and eventually the cottage would become a kind of habitable hedge. Loudon suggests that in warm climates the false wall could extend further out from the cottage, making a veranda (Fig. 17). Other alternatives are medieval (Figs. 19, 21, 22). In these a real second story is added and a solider porch-a kind of cloister-is built. Another cottage gets two different alternative treatments, one Italian and the other Indian (Figs. 23, 24).61 Such additions would of course have to be appropriate, associationally, to the occupant. "It may appear improbable to some," Loudon concludes, "that a person purposing to build so small a dwelling, should think of applying any of these styles to it"; but such a cottage can serve as a landmark.62 Indeed it is precisely a landmark quality, maximum 58 An even heavier associational burden is placed by Loudon on inns, for they stand for "high civilization, and the consequent intercourse of society by public roads, rivers, or canals" (Ibid., p. 675). In primitive countries there are no inns, or the inns are mere hovels. In advanced countries "the inn is frequently a place where greater luxuries are to be obtained than in the private houses of most of the citizens" (Ibid., p. 675). The inn of the future, indeed, will be to democracy what the palace and monastery have been to privilege: they will provide gardens, pleasure grounds, parks, forests, sports, and "all the games and exercises that have been known to contribute to human gratification" (Th%Ad 59 Ibid.,p. 1114. 60 Ibid., pp. 74-80. 61 Ibid., Pp. 76,82. 62 Ibid., p. 80.</page><page sequence="26">88 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES display with minimum means, that all these examples of "archi- tectural style" possess. They are all solid little cubes fitted up with decorative reticulation or piping, jacketed with a large, instantly communicated ideograph, somewhat in the manner of a modern display sign or jukebox.63 To conclude: the emotional side of architectural associationism is foreshadowed in eighteenth-century French architectural writings. Boffrand advocated functional expression, Jacques-Frangois Blondel increased the range of meanings in architecture, and Ledoux went so far as to suggest that architecture was an effective symbolic language. Similar claims were made by English writers, with Whately adding that that architecture was best in which the communication was instantan- eous. But it was not until Alison's more rational associationism came into being, complementing the literary feedback or interpretation practised by certain French authors, that there was a mechanism showing how such emotional or informational transactions might take place. Alison's book thus constituted the real source of architectural 63 Loudon spends so much time discussing villas that a word must be said about the disappointing nature (from an associational viewpoint) of his discussion. For one thing with villas the problem of landscape expression arises more forcibly than with other building-types. Here Loudon's originality is blotted out by existing theories, which he simply takes over (ibid., pp. 763-790). But Loudon does not talk much about association- ism even in the villa building itself; this too is a pastiche from earlier sources, mainly Meason and Hope. It is indeed only when Loudon discusses style that he invokes associa- tional principles. Thus he insists that the best styles for villas are those that will summon the richest train of associations into the average Briton's mind. These are Gothic and Eliza- bethan: "the styles of architecture which have been most familiar to those who inhabit the edifices to be erected." But there is hope for classicism, for the longer a style is in use the more associations it calls up. In the future, therefore, Grecian, Roman, and above all Italian villas will become as beautiful as Gothic and Elizabethan villas are now; but, of course, by then the beauty of the latter will have increased. For the Englishman, Loudon implies, classicism will never quite catch up with Gothicism (ibid., p. 774). Behind all this one clearly senses that for Loudon styles were trivial: he had the attitude of Beckford and Wyatt in this respect at least. And even when style is not simply trivial, it serves only a temporary purpose. Thus "it may appear singular to a resident in Britain that a British emigrant in Van Diemen's Land should wish to build his dwelling in the form of an English church tower; but, duly considered, the feeling will be found to be quite natural. The associations which an object so characteristic of British scenery and civilization is [sic] calculated to raise up in the minds of Britons, resident in far distant, and, as yet, scarcely peopled countries, surrounded by primeval forests or wastes, can hardly be conceived by those who have never experienced them" (ibid., p. 80). The implication is that as the primeval forests disappear under the advance of civilization, the need for imported styles will decrease. Also, styles can awaken a love of history in illiterates, and tell the traveler who does not read, where he is; but with the spread of literacy these uses for style will also disappear. Finally, style can make of a useful building an ornamental toy, and thus "tempt the higher classes to erect comfortable cottages." Aristocrats have been unfitted by their education to appreciate the real beauties of fitness so they must tem- porarily be given the false beauties of style; but the aristocrats, like illiterates, will one day disappear (ibid., p. 649) and so, presumably, will style.</page><page sequence="27">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 89 associationism proper. Knight meanwhile suggested the fuller expressive range in a mixture of styles and Schimmelpenninck the idea that they had religious messages. Both also emphasized the likeness of buildings to organisms. Finally, Loudon, under Alison's influence, invented an actual denotative language of architectural associationism. In doing this he, like Ledoux, undermined the idea that architectural styles were independent, exclusive languages and reduced them to the status of mere vocabularies.64 The classical idea of architecture as a fixed language was thus re- placed by a situation where the observer made instantaneous com- munication with the building sur place, allowing it to work on his emotions and to declare itself to him in other ways. Meanwhile, he, in his perceptions of the building, replied to it, and this response when governed by education and other resources could add to the artistic sum of the whole transaction. Yale University 64 Sutherland Lyall (Architectural Review, 144 [October 1968], 308) has disagreed with this analysis of Loudon. He says that if Loudon had truly been an associationist he would have developed the theme consistently throughout the whole book, and that the critical essay is simply "tacked on for show." Lyall adds that I underestimate the importance of style for Loudon, as shown by the long section in Loudon's book headed "Buildings in Various Styles." He also criticizes me for making my own associationist analyses of Loudon's buildings rather than contenting myself with Loudon's usually more prosaic descriptions. Next comes a confused passage which seems to mean that Loudon, when he was being associational, was insincere; that all he did in fact was string together a mis- cellany of designs, along with other peoples' thoughts about architecture. But there is no reason to believe that Loudon was bound to develop associationism throughout the whole book; an encyclopedia is an encyclopedia, after all-a collection of miscellaneous articles. The essay on architectural criticism is not "tacked on" but is thorough, painstaking, and clearly Loudon's own. As to style, I admit that it had im- portance for Loudon, but he says over and over again that beauty of style is less important than beauty of fitness. The title "Buildings in Various Styles" is simply a convenient rubric and in no sense means that Loudon thought style was particularly important. Finally, it is quite allowable for me to analyze Loudon's or his contributors' designs associationally (i.e. inspiriting them with my own feedback). The "Principles of Archi- tectural Criticism" are provided by Loudon precisely so that the reader may do this. In any case Lyall is quite mistaken in saying that Loudon never provides such analyses himself: almost every design has a paragraph labelled "Expression" where an associational diagnosis is given, more prosaic than those of Ledoux, say, but fully in accord with the system I have described in this article.</page></plain_text>
