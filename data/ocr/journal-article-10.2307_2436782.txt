December, 1939 GENERAL SECTION ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRESENTED BEFORE THE GENERAL SECTION OF THE BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA, COLUMBUS, OHIO, DECEMBER 28 TO 30, 1939 DECOMPOSITION OF CHITIN BY MARINE BACTERIA. Charles W. Hock, Woods Hole Oceanographic In- stitution, Woods Hole, Mass.-Chitin-decomposing bacteria have been isolated from sea water, marine sediments, decomposing crabs, and the intestinal contents of marine animals. Although some of the bacteria grow in a medium consisting only of pure chitin in sea water, others require the addition of a readily availab-le source of nitrogen. Acids, re- ducing sugars, and ammonia have been identified as decomposition products. In an attempt to simu- late natural conditions strips of crude Limulus shell were put in jars of littoral sand, bottom mud, and raw sea water. Decomposition of the shell was rapid in the sand, moderate in the mud, and altogether negligible in the water. Carbon and nitrogen analyses of the shell, sand, and mud, were made at frequent intervals, in order to follow changes in the C:N ratio in the system. OBSERVATIONS ON THE REPRODUCTION OF ULVA LOBATA. Gilbert M. Smith, Stanford University, Calif.-Daily collections were made of plants grow- ing two feet above mean low tide level at Cypress Point near Monterey, Calif. Twice each lunar month there was a conspicuous development of fer- tile cells at the margins of thalli for three or four days; and then a discharge of all zooids within a day or two. The three- or four-day period of zooid accumulation is the only time in a tidal cycle when there is no tidal exposure of the Ulva dur- ing daylight. The period of profuse discharge of zooids occurs on days when exposed plants are re- flooded by the tide shortly after daybreak.-In any random collection of individuals about 80%lo of the fertile plants produce biflagellate gametes and 20%o produce quadriflagellate zoospores.-The gameto- phytes are anisogamous and with female gametes about twice the size of male gametes. Male game- tophytes are distinguishable in the field because of their yellowish-green fertile margins. Female gametophytes have grass-green fertile margins but they cannot be distinguished in the field from fer- tile sporophytes.-The gametophytes are strictly heterothallic. When male and female gametes are mixed in a drop of water there is a clumping of many male gametes about a single female gamete. Both types of gametes are positively phototactic but as soon as a pair begin to fuse the uniting pair be- comes negatively phototactic and swims to the less intensely illuminated margin of the drop.-Zygotes and zoospores show the beginnings of germination within two or three days. No partheno-genetic germination was observed of either male or female gametes. FORMATION OF CELLULOSE PARTICLES IN HALI- CYSTIS SP. Wanda K. Farr, Cellulose Laboratory, Boyce Thompson Institute, Yonkers, N. Y.-The chief visible product of carbohydrate synthesis within the chloroplast is in the form of "para- mylum" rings. In the young, disc-shaped plastid there are two small rings, usually arranged so that a line passing through the central axis of each ring lies approximately parallel to the maj or axis of the plastid disc. As the chloroplast enlarges there is a successive formation of new rings of larger diameter but equal thickness immediately inside the plastid membrane. These larger rings disintegrate within the plastid into uniform-sized particles. After the formation and particulate disintegration of two or more large rings, the chloroplast mem- brane itself breaks down, releasing into the outer regions of the cytoplasm the entire plastid content. This material of plastid origin goes directly into formation of the lamellae of the cell membrane. The two small rings disintegrate, each into four particles, either before the breakdown of the plas- tid membrane, after the breakdown of the plastid membrane, or after the deposition of the plastid material in the cell membrane. The uniform-sized particles resulting from the disintegration of the rings formed within the chloroplast are identified as mercerized cellulose by both microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses. VENTRAL SPECIALIZATIONS OF THE MARCHAN- TIALES. Marjorie McConaha, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.-The ventral specializations of six genera were measured and their relations ana- lyzed. The absorptive surface of the thallus may be increased as much as 5480% by its scales and rhizoids. There was a definite segregation of the two types of rhizoids in all thalli examined. Smooth-walled rhizoids emerge from beneath the scales and make contact with the substrate. Re- gardless of scale arrangement tuberculate rhizoids form a capillary strand beneath each scale and parallel to the thallus. In all these genera the ex- ternal conduction of water along the thallus is aided by the relations of the ventral organs. NUTRITION OF THE SPOROPHYTE IN THE MUSCI. Harold C. Bold, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn., and Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, N. Y.-Until recently the antithetic theory of the nature of alternation of generations has been the dominant one; this has profoundly in- Is</page><page sequence="2">2s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. fluenced morphological studies of the Bryophyte sporophyte. In the light of this view the vegeta- tive activities of this structure are minimized with the implication that such activities are undeveloped or incipient. Studies of the developme-nt of the sporophyte in living Musci clearly indicate that photosynthesis begins early in ontogeny and con- tinues nearly to the time of capsule ripening. Although the moss apophysis undoubtedly is ac- tively photosynthetic, photosynthesis occurs in the sporophyte long before it is differentiated as well as in those species where the apophysis is poorly developed. The absence of functional stomata in the capsule of Sphagnum palustris does not prevent photosynthesis in that structure. The sporophyte of Andreaea also is already photosynthetic before it emerges from the venter. The same is true of the sporophytes of Funaria flavicans, Bartramia pomiformis, Dicranum sp. and Pogonatum penn- sylvanicum. These studies of the sporophytes of representatives of the three groups of Musci, the Sphagnobrya, Andreaeabrya, and Eubrya, along with the author's earlier published studies of the Hepaticean sporophyte, indicate that the sporo- phyte of the Bryophyta early in ontogeny initiates photosynthetic activity and is thus largely "inde- pendent" of the gametophyte in respect to carbo- hydrate nutrition. These observations are inter- preted as supporting the homologous theory of al- ternation which emphasizes the fundamental simi- larity between gametophyte and sporophyte. PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON MOSSES. I. THE DE- VELOPMENT OF LEAFY GAMETOPHYTES IN LIQUID MEDIA. Samuel L. Meyer, Miller School of Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.-In the literature on the physiology of the Musci, there ap- pear contrasting and indefinite opinions concerning the development of leafy gametophytes from pri- mary protonemata of normally aerial species in liquid media. Results of investigations with Phy- scomitrium turbinatum (Michx.) Brid. indicate leafy gametophores develop in liquid nutrient media and that neither direct exposure to air nor attach- ment to a solid substratum is essential for their de- velopment. In the experimental species, both the rate of gametophore development and the number of leafy plants formed are less than on a solid nutrient substrate. Gametophytes grown from pri- mary protonemata submerged in a liquid nutrient medium show pronounced morphological modifica- tions when compared to plants grown normally in air. FERTILIZATION IN VALLISNERIA. Robert B. Wylie, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.-The sperms are formed in the pollen grain and retain their in- tegrity as cells until they emerge from the synergid. One of them soon loses its cytoplasm and is carried as a naked nucleus to the polars. Additional evi- dence is presented in support of the view that the other sperm retains its organization as a cell until it unites with the egg. Male cells with cytoplasm intact were frequently found in contact with the egg membrane having been killed during the brief interval between their emergence and fertilization. If a second pollen tube enters the embryo sac, its sperms remain as male cells protruding from the other synergid. A COMPARISON OF EVOLUTIONARY TENDENCIES IN THE FUNGI, CHLOROPHYTA, AND ANIMALIA. Donald P. Rogers, Oregon State College, Corvallis, Ore.- The three evolutionary series Fungi, Chlorophyta, and Animalia have separately passed through aqua- tic, amphibious, and terricolous stages. The similar biological problems of such evolution have been dif- ferently met by members of the different series. This difference is most striking in the cytological aspects of the life histories: the Fungi ultimately became dikaryotic, the Chlorophyta retained dis- tinct haploid and diploid generations, and the Ani- malia early became almost completely diploid. The differences in evolution are evidence of the sepa- rateness of the series. ERIE BLACK AS AN ACETO-CARMINE AUXILLIARY STAIN. B. R. Nebel, N. Y. Agr. Exp. Sta., Geneva, N. Y.-In making chromosome counts on plants and plant parts treated with colchicine it was found that in cases where aceto-carmine alone is not satis- factory-as in axillary buds of apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, and cherry the following method was successful: Hand section center of bud; kill in 3:1 alcohol acetic acid 10 minutes to 24 hours; alcohol 70 three changes; erie black sat. in 70 alco- hol 5 to 25 minutes; alcohol 70 three changes; transfer to slide and dissect meristematic parts in aceto-carmine under binocular; cover, heat, squeeze and seal or add Zirkle fluid for permanent mount- ing. In sporocyte work erie black may also be em- ployed alone or in combination with aceto-carmine if a dark purple nuclear stain is desired. A MORE GRAPHIC COMPARATIVE LIFE-HISTORY CHART. Dwight M. Moore, University of Arkan- sas, Fayetteville, Ark.-Charts showing compara- tively the usual outstanding stages in the life his- tories of the representatives of the various phyla have often been presented on radial lines of com- centric circles. This gives no idea of the relative prominence of the various stages. The present chart shows graphically the decrease in the gametophyte in a heart-shaped area bounded by the lines repre- senting fusion of gametes and meiosis, respectively, and the corresponding increase in prominence of the sporophyte generation. Definite colors are used to indicate various structures, generations or other features. TEACHING AIDS IN BOTANY. I.-THE PLACEMENT TEST. S. M. Dietz and C. J. Gould, Jr., Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa.-The placement test as used in General Botany at Iowa State College has been developed over a period of twelve years. Prior to 1934 it was used in evaluating student ability but since then it has also been used as a means of sec- tioning students according to their ability and as a basis for modifying the course for groups and individuals. This placement test, consisting of 10-</page><page sequence="3">Dec., 19391 ABSTRACTS-GENERAL SECTION 3s 16 questions and requiring about an hour for ad- ministration, is given at the first class contact. The questions are given in pairs and involve a rating of some of the testable, course objectives which in- clude skills and abilities: in reading, observing, recognizing problems, formulating hypotheses, ex- perimenting, interpreting data and drawing logical conclusions. Each year, 650 students are sectioned into 22 high, medium, or low groups. High sections are given more supplementary materials, more free- dom in selection of materials and experiments, a wider range of applied problems and more practice in the use of the scientific method. Acquisition of information plays a more important role in the low sections. A comparison of rankings of paired ques- tions of the placement test with their corresponding pairs of questions in the comprehensive final exam- ination affords a valuable teaching aid to the in- dividual instructors by: (1) indicating in which type of section an instructor is most capable; (2) indicating the strong as well as the weak points of individual instructors; and (3) affording a quan- titative measure of student progress which is used in teacher-conference groups. ABNORMAL MICROSPOROGENESIS IN TRADESCANTIA. William L. Brown and Edward C. Berry, Henry Shaw School of Botany, Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.-Abnormal microspores and pollen grains, closely resembling types artificially in- duced in various Angiosperms, have been found to occur under natural conditions in one individual of Tradescantia subaspera Ker-Gawl. Approximately fifteen percent of the microspores of any given anther are abnormal. This number remains fairly constant throughout the flowering period of the plant. Cell walls frequently fail to form in the diads, resulting in microspores with the unreduced number of chromosomes. In such cases delayed cell wall formation by furrowing is initiated in the microspore or pollen stages. Abnormal microspores possess approximately one-third more refractive granules than do normal ones. THE NATURE OF THE DIVISION OF THE GENERA- TIVE CELL IN TRADESCANTIA AND POLYGONATUM. 0. J. Eigsti, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Okla.-The mitotic features involved in the forma- tion of microgametes were studied for Tradescantia occidentalis (Britton) Smyth. and Polygonatum commutatum (R &amp; S) Dietr. In late prophase, the chromosomes of Tradescantia (n-6) are arranged end to end with the longest dimension of the chromosome parallel to the wall of the tube. The metaphasic stage begins when the chromosomes from each extremity migrate toward a central point. During this process the daughter chromo- somes separate and subsequently pass into different nuclei. The chromosomes of Polygonatum (n-20) are arranged upon a definite equatorial plate early in the process, from which the daughter chromo- somes separate from each other. The addition of colchicine to the culturing medium prevented the migration of prophasic chromosomes in Trade- scantia, and inhibited equatorial plate formation in Polygonatum. The formation of nuclei in the pol- len tube continued in the presence of colchicine, resulting in the production of a variable number of nuclei. A cytological analysis revealed that each nucleus contains both daughter chromosomes of the doubled metaphasic chromosome. Upon cursory examination the mitotic processes of the generative cell of these plants seemed different in appearance, however, detailed study disclosed a fundamental similarity between the two. Furthermore, the failure of a complete separation of the daughter chromo- somes in the presence of colchicine indicates that the mitotic features of the nuclei of pollen tubes are essentially the same as those of an ordinary mitosis. When treated with colchicine, the formation of nuclei without the separation of daughter chromo- somes is an interesting feature of cellular behavior in pollen tubes. SOMATIC DOUBLING OF CHROMOSOMES AND NODU- LAR INFECTION IN CERTAIN LEGUMINOSAE. Louise Wipf and D. C. Cooper, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.-Cells having the tetraploid number of chromosomes are occasionally present in the root in the root hair region of the following diploid plants: Pisum sativum L., Lathyrus latifolius L., L. odoratus L., Lespedeza tomentosa Siebold, and Vicia villosa Roth. Such cells are located in the parenchyma of the cortex usually near the endo- dermis and in the region of young secondary roots. There appears to be a definite relationship between the formation of root nodules in pea and vetch and normally occurring tetraploid cells. Wherever nodular stimulation occurs one or more tetraploid cells are found in the proliferating region of the cortex even though the infection thread has not, as yet, penetrated that area. Later the rhizobia oc- cupy only the cells with the doubled chromosome number. Many infection threads cause no stimula- tion whatever, even though they pass through sev- eral layers of inner cortical cells. In such instances no tetraploid cells were observed in the vicinity of the infection threads. The infection thread has a pathogenic effect on the nuclei of the diploid cells which it penetrates; the chromatin linin net work becomes diffuse, the nuclear membrane assumes ir- regular shapes, and the nucleus takes a much deeper stain than those of adjacent uninfected cells. MEIOSIS AND THE CULTIVATION OF EXCISED ANTHERS IN NUTRIENT SOLUTION. Walton C. Greg- ory, The Blandy Experimental Farm, University of Virginia, Boyce, Va.-The cultivation of ex- cised anthers in nutrient media led to abnormal growth and development in Lilium longiflorum and to cessation of growth in Lycopersicum esculentum, "Bonny Best," and in Datura stramonium. This separation of young anthers from the parent plants led to meiotic failure in all three species. Similar reactions in excised buds and in large cuttings in- dicate that these effects were not caused by the arti- ficial medium. The normal procedure of meiosis in a grafted cutting of Lycopersicum and its failure</page><page sequence="4">4s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. in a similar non-grafted cutting indicates an in- fluence on the part of the stock. It is suggested that the meiotic stimulus is not an inherent property of the sporogenous tissue but is furnished to that tissue by more remote portions of the plant. THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC EFFECTS OF X-RAYS. Karl Sax, Arnold Arboretum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.-The exposure of cells to X-rays produces two types of response. The first is a physiological effect which results in a partial fusion of metaphase chromosomes and a temporary alteration of nuclear development. Nuclei irradiated at prophase or in the resting stage recover from the physiological effect even though many chromosome aberrations are produced. These permanent aberrations are caused by direct X-ray "hits" and are lethal in diploid cells only when homozygous deficiencies are produced. These chromosome aberrations are referred to as genetic effects since they result in deficiencies or position effects. Either the genetic or physiological effect of X-rays may be cell lethal, and presumably both factors are of importance in radiation therapy. THE USE OF PERICLINAL CHIMERAS IN TRACING THE GERM-LAYER ORIGIN OF TISSUES IN DATURA. Sophia Satina and A. F. Blakeslee, Carnegie Insti- tution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y. -Seed treatment with colchicine is a new and effec- tive method of inducing periclinal chimeras. In Datura the most frequent chimera type had a 4n or 8n epidermis with 2n internal tissue, but types also were found with 2n epidermis and 4n internal tissue. The cortex may be distinguished from the central cylinder as well as from the epidermis by differences in the chromosome number. Such dif- ferences may involve chromosome deficiencies as well as doubled chromosome number. Differences in chromosome number and size of affected cells may be used as labels with which to identifv the differ- ent germ layers from which they have arisen. The evidence seems to indicate that there are at least 3 definite germ layers in Datura. The dermatogen is found to give rise not only to the epidermis but to contribute to internal tissue. SEED PATTERNS IN LILIUM AND THEIR SIGNIFI- CANCE. A. B. Stout, New York Botanical Garden, New York, N. Y.-The disposition of seeds in cap- sules of Lilium allows one to construct charts of the relative positions of various classes of seeds in rela- tion to (1) the abortion of ovules, (2) the pollen- tube behavior in incompatibilities, and (3) the in- ternal stimulations involved in the development of phenospermic seeds. The seed patterns for the fully self-incompatible triploid Lilium tigrinum clone IN- TERMEDIATE show that at least 50 per cent of the ovules are functional when tested in most successful hybridizations. In various individuals and clones of Lilium candidum there is definite evidence that there are two main types of pollen-tube distribution associated with incompatibility; there is (1) a dis- tal distribution in which the pistil and ovary as a whole limit pollen-tube penetration and (2) there is a scattered distribution in which there appears to be selective relations with individual ovules. The distribution of the different sizes of phenospermic seeds indicate that the size of such seeds depends on the distance from well-developed seeds, and that there is the action of stimulating substances, such as growth hormones, which spread through vascular tissues from fertilized ovules and developing em- bryos. INHERITANCE OF SEED-COAT COLOR IN PEANUTS. B. B. Higgins, Georgia Experiment Station, Ex- periment, Ga.-In the course of an extensive breed- ing project with peanuts, crosses have been made involving some 16 varieties and strains, including varieties with red, flesh, and white seed-coat colors. Generally the inheritance of seed-coat colors fol- lowed very closely the genetical segregations previ- ously reported by other workers. However, one variety, Pearl, with a white seed coat differs from any previously reported in that in every cross made the F1 seed coats are red. In crosses using Pearl with another white variety, Philippine White, which appears from other crosses to have no factor for color, the F1 seed coats are red and F2 red, flesh, and white. The results from all crosses made indicate that the Pearl has factors for both red and flesh colors and also two inhibitors both of which are necessary to prevent development of color. DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERN OF THE LEAF BLADE IN 2N AND 4N ZEA MAYS AS RELATED TO THE STRUC- TURE OF THE GROWING POINT. E. C. Abbe, Uni- versity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn., L. F. Randolph, Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. De- partment of Agriculture, and Cornell University, and J. Einset, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.- In 2n Zea mays, leaf blades 6 to 12 (counting up- wards from the coleoptile) are successively and regularly wider for any given length when com- pared ontogenetically. Measurements of the grow- ing points at the stages when the primordia of these leaves are being formed indicate that the successive growing points also increase regularly in circum- ference and volume. Increase in cell number is re- sponsible for this increase in size of the growing points, cell size remaining essentially uniform. The leaf blade initial originates as an equatorial bulge at the base of the growing point in corn. The basal circumference of the growing point is therefore taken as a measure of the initial width of the leaf blade. The successively greater circumferences, due to an increase in the number of cells, are directly reflected in the greater relative widths of the asso- ciated leaves. In 2n and 4n corn, an ontogenetic comparison of leaf blades 10 shows an analogous condition, the 4n leaf blade being wider than the 2n for any given length. This greater relative width is correlated with a corresponding difference in grow- ing point volume and circumference. The greater volume of the 4n growing point is, however, due to increase in cell size, cell number remaining the same. There is a corresponding difference in nuclear volumes presumably associated with polyploidy.</page><page sequence="5">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-GENERAL SECTION 5s STUDIES PERTAINING TO THE LIFE HISTORY OF SPECULARIA PERFOLIATA (L.) A. DC., WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO CYTOLOGICAL ASPECTS. J. A. T7rent, State Teachers College, Pittsburg, Kan.-A com- parative study was made of both open and cleisto- gamous flowers. Megasporogenesis and microsporo- genesis were found to be essentially the same in both kinds of flowers. The archesporial cell in the ovule becomes the megaspore mother cell directly. The usual tetrad of megaspores is produced. The chalazal megaspore becomes the functional one, and through its subsequent divisions, a "normal" embryo sac is produced. The antipodal nuclei un- dergo rapid divisions giving rise to a multicellular "haustorium." The synergids move into the micro- pyle and give rise to a micropylar "haustorium." Microsporogenesis follows the usual procedure for most angiosperms. The mature pollen grains are 2-3 nucleate by the time they leave the pollen sac. In the open flowers, the pollen grains germinate on the stigma, and the tubes pass to the ovary through the stylar tissue. In the cleistogamous flowers, the pollen grains germinate within the pol- len sac. The tubes penetrate the wall of the pollen sac, reach the stigma, and pass to the ovary in the same manner as in the open flowers. The genera- tive nucleus divides within the pollen grain before germination. Fertilization occurs in the usual man- ner. Endosperm formation may occur in the absence of triple fusion or even the fusion of polar nuclei. The endosperm becomes fully developed in many instances, in both open and closed flowers, in the absence of an embryo. POLYPLOIDY AND WINTER HARDINESS RELATION- SHIPS IN THE FLOWERING PLANTS WITH REFERENCE TO KARYOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS. Wray M. Bow- den, The Blandy Experimental Farm, University of Virginia, Boyce, Va.-An investigation of the relationships between chromosome number, degree of winter hardiness, and the geographical distribu- tion of the flowering plants was begun bv the author in the spring of 1938. To date some 100 species and varieties pertinent to this problem have been ex- amined cytologically. A brief comparison of certain critically significant species indicates that in most cases the degree of winter hardiness is not corre- lated with chromosome number differences. Further- more, the evidence indicates that the degree of hard- iness depends upon the genetic constitution of the individual. The whole range of variability in degree of hardiness can be found in either diploid species or in polyploid species. The cases reported in the literature which have correlated higher chromosome number with increased altitude or latitude, appar- ently illustrate only one of the various types of karyogeographical complexes. A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF THE ACENA- PHTHENE RESPONSE SEEN IN CERTAIN SEEDLINGS. A. Orville Dahl, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.-Hypocotylous swelling, identical with that seen in colchicine-treated seedlings, was noted in Ipomoea L. exposed to acenaphthene (naphthy- leneethylene, C1OH6(CH2)2) fumes. Certain ab- normalities in the curvatures of these seedlings sug- gest that disturbances of morphological polarity are involved. An experimental series utilizing germinat- ing grains of a pure line of Avena sativa L. which received acenaphthene or colchicine treatment has shown marked swelling of the coleoptilar portion of the embryo as well as a general lack of normally polarized growth. Those seedlings receiving ace- naphthene treatment differed from the colchicine- treated series in having greater elongation of the coleoptile as well as a peculiar curvature response which directed the tip of the coleoptile away from the scutellum in the direction of the coleorhiza. Cross-sectional views of the coleoptile indicate that with colchicine treatment the swelling noted is definitely greater than that seen with the use of acenaphthene. Preliminary investigation of the his- tological aspects of these phenomena indicates that matters of cell size and shape in addition to differ- ential maturation of cells are involved. It seems likely that both acenaphthene and colchicine are capable of causing disturbances which bear no direct relationship to their well-known effect upon the spindle. THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION OF ISOLATED WOODY TISSUES. Richard H. Goodwin and David R. God- dard, University of Rochester, Rochester, N. Y.- Thin sections of tissues were cut from the trunks of ash and maple trees with a sliding microtome and their oxygen consumption was measured in Fenn micro-respirometers. In trees collected before bud break oxygen consumption is most rapid in the cambial region. Values for the adj acent secondary phloem and xylem are somewhat lower. In the xylem the rate of oxygen consumption becomes progres- sively lower as one passes toward the center of the tree, reaching a very low but measureable rate in the heartwood. In trees collected after bud break the rate of oxygen consumption of the cambium, phloem, and heartwood is essentially the same as before bud break. In the newly-formed, differentiat- ing xylem, however, it considerably exceeds the cambial rate. The above relations hold true whether oxygen consumption is expressed per gram of fresh weight or per milligram of nitrogen. A BOTANICAL SURVEY OF BOIS BLANC ISLAND, MAC- KINAC COUNTY, MICH. Marjorie T. Bingham, Cran- brook Institute of Science, Bloomfield Hills, Mich. -Bois Blanc Island, situated in Lake Huron, be- tween Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas is within the Lake Forest vegetation zone. Within its seventy square miles are widely varied vegetation types, with transition belts so limited or entirely lacking that one passes abruptly from one plant community to another. Spring, summer and fall ex- peditions have revealed nineteen distinctly different communities composed of approximately six hun- dred species of plants. On the Lake Huron shores one finds not only the expected differences of high, middle and low beach but within a few hundred feet the character of the shore is totally altered. Shores</page><page sequence="6">6s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. of the six inland lakes are unlike the Lake Huron shores. The dominant coniferous forest is entirely replaced in certain sections by pure stands of hard- woods. A few old clearings have assumed the aspect of depauperized meadows, others with more mois- ture are lush with flowers, many are reverting to forest. Fifty per cent of the island consists of nearly impassable cedar swamp. A small area held in reserve by the United States government has re- mained primeval forest. SALT MARSH PLANTS IN RELATION TO TIDE LEVELS ON THE CALIFORNIAN COAST. Ira L. Wiggins, Stan- ford University, Calif.-An accurate determination of the levels at which Spartina leiantha Benth., Dis- tichlis spicata (L.) Greene, Salicornia pacifica Standley, and Frankenia grandifolia C. &amp; S., grow in eight coastal salt marshes from San Diego to San Francisco Bay shows that these species are confined to definite tidal zones. Spartina grows from about mean sea level to somewhat above mean sea high water. Salicornia grows from a short distance be- low mean high water upward. Distichlis and Fran- kenia grow on the higher levels of the salt marshes, never dropping below the plane of mean high water. Where the tidal regime is low these two plants ap- proach closely the level of mean high water, Dis- tichlis growing 0.10 feet and Frankenia 0.28 feet above mean high water at a station where that level is 4.00 feet above mean lower low water. Where the tidal regime is greater both grow at somewhat higher levels. A study of the curves of tidal charts suggests that the lower limit to which salt marsh plants can grow is determined by their response to the average total time of submergence during the twenty-four hours rather than to direct responses to the depth of flooding. DESERT FLORA OF NORTHERN PERU IN AN EXCEP- TIONALLY RAINY YEAR. Harvey E. Stork, Carleton College, Northfield, Minn.-The heaviest rainfall that the desert of the Piura Department of North- ern Peru had experienced for many years brought out a dense growth of vegetation in 1939. Most of the growth was produced by five species of grasses and ten species of other annuals, seeds of which can remain viable in the sandy soil during long periods of drought. Several perennials depend upon subterranean storage organs to carry them over the dry years, and two woody species survive by sending tap roots to an eight meter depth. DISTRIBUTION OF BRIGHT BELT TOBACCO ROOTS IN RELATION TO SOIL PROFILE. L. J. Gier, Campbell College, Buies Creek, N. C.-During 1937 and 1938, the root systems of over 700 tobacco plants, from two soils each of the Norfolk and Ruston series of Harnett County, N. C., were examined. The bulk of the root system for each of these plants was in the plowed A horizon, although many feed- ing roots extended into the A2. Usually only a single root entered the B horizon. Branching seemed to be determined by the moisture content, soil texture, distance from the stem, and cultivation methods. There was a definite correlation between the total sands, the total colloids, and the root distribution. DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUT GRASS PLANT (CY- PERUS ROTUNDUS L.). J. R. Jackson and E. V. Smith, Alabama Agric. Exp. Sta., Auburn, Ala.- The nut grass plant consists of tubers and con- necting rhizomes, rosettes of foliage leaves, and umbel-bearing scapes. New plant systems develop from isolated tubers by the growth of apical or lateral buds which produce rhizomes terminated either by rosettes of foliage leaves or by tubers arising by secondary growth of the pericycle of the rhizome. A rhizome which terminates in a rosette of foliage leaves later produces a tuber at the base of the leaves. Any new tuber formed in the system either produces rhizomes from terminal or lateral buds or becomes dormant. A system of more than one hundred tubers may be formed in one season. The plant exhibits both collateral and amphivasal bundles, clearly differentiated cortical and stelar regions, secondary growth by the pericycle, and a cork cambium. A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SUBTERRANEAN MEMBERS OF SEVERAL CROP PLANTS. Howard J. Ditt- mer, Chicago T'eachers College, Chicago, Ill.- Quantitative data were obtained through counts and measurements of the roots and root hairs of Kentucky bluegrass, winter rye, oats, and soy beans. In soil samples 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep, bluegrass had far more numerous sub- terranean members than any of the other plants, and all grasses greatly exceeded soy beans in num- ber, length and surface area. However, only blue- grass exceeded soy beans in volume. Based on these figures the tap root system of soy beans is verv poorly adapted for binding soil. The fibrous root systems of bluegrass, winter rye and oats are far more effective, ranking in efficiency in the order given. METHODS IN AEROBIOLOGY. 0. C. Durham, A b- bott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.-In study- ing the aerial incidence and dispersal of pollens, fungus spores and insect particles which are rec- ognized as causes of inhalant allergy, wide use has been made of the gravity method of sampling. Con- sideration is given to the advantages and disadvan- tages of various devices for securing rapid deposits of aerial debris and for obtaining volumetric counts. The special problems encountered in taking sam- ples from airplanes over land and water are dis- cussed. Attention is given to a practical technic for preparing and counting atmospheric slides. CHANGES IN GRASSLAND VEGETATION IN WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA 1932 THROUGH 1939. Warren Wthit- man, Herbert C. Hanson and Roald Peterson, North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station, Fargo, N. D.-The period of 1932 through 1939 included two seasons of serious drought in western North Dakota. These occurred in 1934 and 1936. The ef- fects of these drought years on the grassland vege- tation were greater than the combined effects of any other factors or groups of factors during this period.</page><page sequence="7">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-GENERAL SECTION 7s The severe seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions resulted in wide variations in abundance, density, height growth, seed production, and rela- tive proportions of the constituent species of the grassland communities. These ehanges, however, were not as extensive nor as striking as those re- ported from the Central and Southern Great Plains. The most obvious effect of the two seasons of drought on the grassland vegetation was a reduc- tion in basal area and in abundance of the principal species. The losses incurred as a result of the drought have not yet been fully made up, even after three fairly favorable seasons. Bouteloua gracilis, Agropyron smithii, and Stipa comata were all seri- ously affected, although the latter species made a remarkable recovery as the result of spread from surviving established clumps and from seedlings. Koeleria cristata was reduced by about 80 per cent, and Andropogon scoparius showed a 50 per cent de- crease in abundance. Practically all species have shown appreciable recovery since 1937. Both annual and perennial forbs were reduced in number during the drought years. In most cases, however, large gains were made in the succeeding years. This was especially true of the annual forbs; the perennials showed less fluctuation. Considered over the whole period of observation both peren- nials and annuals made a net increase. In only a few cases did they become dominant over any con- siderable extent of native grassland. SPECIES SENESCENCE. Stanley A. Cain, Univer- sity of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.-The question of species senescence is considered in connection with the problem of limitation, in the East, of epi- biotic species to nunnatak areas. That species senes- cence is a fact is questioned. It is suggested that the apparent lack of aggressiveness of such dis- junct and circumscribed occurrences of a species may have a genetical explanation in the isolation of a relatively homozygous marginal portion of the species population as a whole with a resultant nar- rower ecological amplitude. This phenomenon, cou- pled with the limited occurrence of suitable edaphic situations in the region of the epibiotics, is sufficient to explain their local occurrence and lack of com- petitive ability in most situations. It does not seem necessary to hypothesize species "senescence," and the anthropomorphism may easily obscure true ecological explanations. PLANT ECOLOGY: THE TWO USES OF THE TERM. Frank E. Egler, Syracuse University, Syracuse, N. Y.-American and European "ecology" have de- veloped under an unintentional isolationist policy, with the result that the term ecology now has a double usage, not adequately recognized, and caus- ing unnecessary confusion and criticism. To exem- plify this double usage, seven leading textbooks, covering the same subject matter, are summarized in regard to nomenclature: those of Braun-Blan- quet, Pavillard, Reynaud-Beauverie, Coulter Barnes &amp; Cowles, Tounmey &amp; Korstian, McDougall, and Weaver &amp; Clements. In Europe, as sciences have expanded and new sciences emerged, it is accepted that the term ecology is etymologically too restricted to embrace the many fields of knowledge emanating from the original ecology of Haeckel; in America the term, regardless of etymology, embraces all fields of botanical knowledge not orthodox morphol- ogy, physiology, taxonomy, and genetics. VEGETATION OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN VALLEY IN SOUTHERN COLORADO. Francis Ramaley, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.-The San Luis Valley is about 100 miles long and 40 miles wide. Annual precipitation is only 8 inches but the water-table of the central part is close to the surface. Ecologically, there are (a) floor, (b) margin, (c) rim. The floor bears a greasewood scrub (Sarcobatus) mixed with rabbit brush (Chrysothamnus). The valley margin supports a growth of undershrubs, low species of rabbit brush, snakeweed (Gutierrezie), and sage- brush (Artemisia), with much grama grass (Boute- loua) and some spring-flowering herbs. The valley rim is foothill country with open pinyon-pine wood- land and grama grassland, changing to spruce-pine forest at higher elevations. Plant communities be- sides those already noted include: river-bottom for- est, sedge moor, mixed meadow, sandy-soil grass- land, oak chaparral, and aspen groves. UNRECOGNIZED INITIAL STAGE OF PLANT SUCCES- SION AND ITS PROMINENCE IN SOIL EROSION CONTROL IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES. W. E. Booth, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kan.- Five members of the Myxophyceae, usually little thought of as being of great positive economic im- portance, have been found to be of major impor- tance in the Red Plains Region and oak savannah of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They form a com- plete, nonerosive layer over hundreds of acres of badly eroded and abandoned crop land. In addition to erosion control this algal growth is valuable in creating an environment favorable to plant succes- sion. FURTHER STUDIES ON ZONAL STRUCTURE AND GROWTH IN THE SHOOT APEX OF CYCAS REVOLUTA. Adriance S. Foster, University of California, Ber- keley, Calif.-Following the seedling stage, the shoot apex increases notably in size and in plants 40-50 years old may reach a diameter of 2.5-3.5 mm. Associated with this increase in bulk of the terminal meristem, numerous, small spirally-ar- ranged foliar primordia arise from the peripheral zone and develop into the alternating "crowns" of cataphylls and foliage leaves. Although the apices of vegetative and reproductive individuals appear to be fundamentally similar in general zonal struc- ture, the form of the apex varies from a blunt cone to a low truncate mound. Apparently these form differences reflect periodic changes in the relative intensity and distribution of growth in certain zones of the apex. In very broad plateau-shaped apices, the rib meristem zone is reduced in area and activity as compared with the very prominent zone of peripheral tissue in which mitoses are frequent. Conversely, in cone-shaped apices, the zone of rib</page><page sequence="8">8s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. meristem is well-defined and active. The implica- tion of these facts is briefly discussed with reference (1) to the rhythmical growth of the shoot and (2) to the problem of organization and structural evolu- tion of the shoot apex in gymnosperms. EMBRYOGENY OF TORREYA NUCIFERA. John T. Buchholz, University of Illinois, Urbana, Ill.- Stages from fertilization onward show nearly all stages in the embryogeny. Cleavage polyembryony is the rule for this and probably other species of Torreya. There are 2-4 archegonia of which usually only one is fertilized, though several cases of two adjacent proembryos in separate archegonia were observed. The proembryo, in which walls form after 4 free nuclei, is confined to the lower one-half or two-thirds of the egg. A dormant winter stage fol- lows the formation of from 12-20 cells, with pro- suspensor cells only slightly elongated. Morpho- logical and embryological studies support scheme of phylogeny of Taxaceae suggested by Saxton. A STATISTICAL STUDY OF TWO VARIABLES IN THE SEQUOIAS-POLLEN GRAIN SIZE AND COTYLEDON NUM- BERS. John T. Buchholz and Margaret Kaeiser, University of Illinois, Urbana, 111.-In Sequoiaden- dron giganteum the diameters of 500 expanded pol- len grains gave a mean of 22.47 ? 0.05 mu (v 1.47). In Sequoia sempervirens an equal number of pollen grains gave a mean diameter of 32.85 ? 0.11 mu (a = 2.60). While the extremes overlap slightly, there is no question as to the significance of this difference which is 85.7 times the standard error. The cotyledon numbers were similarly studied in several hundred seeds of these two forms and the results show that the Big Tree has a mean of 3.7 and the Redwood 2.1. THE EMBRYOGENIES OF BIOTA AND THITJA. Phyl- lis L. Cook, Ardmore, Pa.-Biota and Thuja repres- sent two types of embryogeny, the former exhibit- ing extreme cleavage polyembryony, and the latter, simple polyembryony with only traces of cleavage. The proembryos are similar except for size. Certain of the proembryonic cells assume the role of prosus- pensors, while the three to five most distal cells con- tribute the embryos. In Biota each one of these dis- tal cells gives rise to one embryo, while in Thuja, all three to five contribute to one embryonic body. In Biota, each embryonic cell divides, the distal cell remaining embryonic and the proximal becom- ing the primary suspensor cell. In Thuja, no pri- mary suspensor is formed. Embryonic competition is keen in Biota, entailing great elongation and twisting of suspensors. Several embryos become massive and form secondary suspensors. In Thuja, competition is limited to the number of zygotes, and secondary suspensor formation begins early. After the embryos become massive, tissue development is similar in the two genera, except for the greater size of all structures in Biota. DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND EMBRYO IN REGNELLIDIUM DIPHYLLUM. Noe L. Higinbotham, Columbia University, New York, N. Y.-The cell by cell formation of the female gametophyte from the megaspore as well as the de- velopment of the fertilized egg into a young plant has been observed in the monotypic genus Regnelli- dium. As in -he related Marsilea and Pilularia, the archegonium is formed at the spore apex, but in Reg- nellidium it is enclosed by the folds of the apical papilla. Fertilization is accomplished in about 25 hours. As described for Marsilea and Pilularia, the first division is parallel with the long axis of the archegonium. The following divisions in Regnelli- dium, however, do not agree with the descriptions given for those other genera. The second division, in the best cases found, is not transverse but is again parallel with the long axis of the archegonium and divides the embryo unequally into four cells. The third division then follows transversely to the archegonial axis. Eventually a cotyledon with a dis- tinct blade is developed and later leaves gradually attain the mature bipinnate form. Regnellidium closely resembles Marsilea and Pilularia, and the bearing of the present data on the relationships within the family is discussed. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMBRYO OF BARLEY. James Merry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.-The embryonic development of barley was studied in normal embryos and in others excised and grown on nutrient agar. Those excised and cul- tured showed no further development such as would take place in the ovary, but grew into small plants which fixed the particular stage of the embryo at the time of culturing. A series of such plants from embryos of various ages was studied and the rela- tionships between the parts of the embryo deter- mined. The scutellum and coleoptile are differenti- ated previous to and separately from the stem axis and are thus considered to be structures peculiar to the embryo and in no way comparable to the lateral organs of the stem. RELATIVE GROWTIH OF DIFFERENT RADII IN CROSS- SECTIONS OF DEVELOPING OVARIES OF IRIS FULVA AND I. HEXAGONA VAR. GIGANTICAERULEA. Herbert P. Riley, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.- In ovaries of giganticaerulea the shortest radius (the septum between carpels) grows faster relative to the radius through the midrib of the carpel than in fulva. The relative growth rates of midrib-radius and longest radius (about 300 from the midrib- radius) are about the same in both species until the capsule is partially formed at which time in fulva the former grows somewhat faster relative to the latter. The rates of midrib-radius in relation to the radius half-way between the longest and shortest radii (about 450 from the midrib radius) is the same in both species. The 450 radius grows faster relative to the septum in giganticaerulea until about anthesis, when it slows down in that species and accelerates in fulva; these radii are about the same in length in the largest capsules of both species. There is an absolute increase in the size of paren- chyma cells of the ovary wall during development.</page><page sequence="9">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-GENERAL SECTION Final shape depends on the original shape when the ovary is first organized and the relative rates of development of the different radii. FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE ENDODERMIS IN MONOCOTYLE- DONOUS PLANTS. D. S. VanFleet, Indiana Univer- sity, Bloomington, Ind.-Investigations on the formation, distribution and maturation of the endo- dermis in monocotyledonous plants indicate the presence of an oxidase system associated with endo- dermal tissue. The extracellular and lamellar loca- tion of the oxidases is a factor in the location and ultimate development of the endodermis. All of the characteristic configurations of the endodermal cell, including the Casparian strip and the centripetal thickening associated with many mature cells, is be- lieved to be an expression of a differential in oxidase and antioxidase distribution and activity. The pres- ence of the endodermis in underground stems and its absence in most aerial stems may thus be ac- counted for. Atmospheric oxygen or organic per- oxides in the cortex and enzymatic effusa from the phloem result in an endodermis or mestome sheath whose configuration varies with environmental, cor- tical and stelar conditions. These conclusions were reached as a result of the microchemical examina- tion or experimental modification of environmental conditions in 86 species distributed through 62 genera and 14 families. THE OCCURRENCE OF VESSELS IN THE MONOCOT- YLEDONEAE. Vernon I. Cheadle, Rhode Island State College, Kingston, R. I.-All parts of the plants of over 100 species of 75 genera in 18 fami- lies were investigated by use of both sections and macerations of the tissues. Vessels were found in the roots of all species investigated. Vessels with only porous perforation plates predominate in only the Agavaceae. Vessels with only scalariform per- foration plates predominate in the Amaryllidaceae, Liliaceae, Araceae, Pandanaceae, Bromeliaceae, Strelitziaceae, Trilliaceae, Typhaceae. Zingiber- aceae and are found in four species of the Aga- vaceae. Vessels are found in the stems of a compara- tively small number of the species and where found generally have scalariform perforation plates. They are present in the Smilacaceae, Pandanaceae, Pal- mae, Gramineae and in seven species of the Lili- aceae. In Acorus and Monstera there may be a few vessels. Vessels are found in the leaves of even fewer species. They have been noted only in the Gramineae, Palmae, Pandanaceae, Smilacaceae and in Cordyline terminalis and Dracaena fragrans. It is obvious that, aside from the roots, the organs of the plants in the Monocotyledoneae are more often characterized by the absence of vessels rather than by their presence. Futhermore, in the majority of cases, the vessels generally have the more primitive types of perforation plates. SEPTAL GLANDS IN THE LILIALES. Carrolle E. An- derson, Adelphi College, Garden City, Long Island, N. Y.-The structure of the septal glands was studied in the pistils of two hundred and fifteen species representing ninety-four genera of the Lili- ales. These septal glands are intercarpellary spaces lined with a simple or a several-layered glandular epithelium. Glands are not present in all genera and species, but the Juncaceae is the only family studied in which they are completely lacking. The size of the gland varies greatly both as to radial and vertical extent. The position of the glands in respect to the locules varies also, some glands being found only below the locules (basal); some appearing at about the middle of the ovary (median); and some visible only at the top of the ovary (terminal). Ex- ternal secretory pores may be present or absent. Secretions from the glands may be poured out di- rectly through basal pores or grooves; they may flow down from the summit of the ovary through tiny tubes; or they may be secreted through termi- nal or median pores and then flow down intercarpel- lary grooves to the base of the floral organs. THE BORDER-PARENCHYMA AND THE VEIN-RIBS OF CERTAIN DICOTYLEDONOUS LEAVES. Richard R. Ar- macost, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.-A survey of seventy species, involving mesophytic leaves from woody and herbaceous plants as well as broad-leaved evergreens, showed that the border- parenchyma invested all minor veins as an unbroken sheath one layer of cells in thickness. Its presence greatly increased the area for mesophyll contacts with the conductive system (from 122 per cent to 238 per cent), while its volume was from 300 per cent to 1100 per cent greater than that of the en- closed vein. Dorsi-ventral extensions (vein-ribs) from the border-parenchyma to the epidermis were present in all these leaves. Experiments showed that these vein-ribs promptly conducted eosin solu- tion to the epidermis from veins of certain catego- ries in every species tested. Evidence indicates that the border-parenchyma and the vein-ribs play an important part in conduction between blade tissues and veins. THE RELATION BETWEEN PLANE OF CELL DIVISION AND ORGAN FORM IN CUCURBIT FRUITS. Edmund W. Sinnott, Columbia University, New York, N. Y.- Differences in fruit shape in cucurbits are due to differences in growth rate between various dimen- sions, either during early development or through- out growth. In a number of races differing in dimen- sional growth rates, the angle between the polar axis of a dividing cell and the longitudinal axis of the ovary was measured for a large number of cells. Frequency of division in a given plane was found to be closely related to growth rate of the ovary in that plane. Whatever determines the plane in which a cell divides is therefore concerned with the con- trol of form differences in the developing organ. Plane of division was found to be most variable in metaphase and least in telophase, indicating that the position of the figure is not established at the be- ginning of mitosis. THE PEG OF THE CUCURBITS: A STRUCTURE IN- DUCED BY GROWTH HORMONE? Carl D. LaRue, Uni- versity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.-Squash</page><page sequence="10">los AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. seeds with outer coats reiioved, germinated hori- zontally, form pegs on the lower side, but upright, exposed to light from one direction, produce pegs on the shaded side. Upright in darkness they de- velop pegs entirely around the hypocotyls. If the inner coats are completely removed, pegs are not formed, but if coats are left intact on one side pegs appear on that side. Seeds without inner coats but smeared on one side with 0.1 % 3-indole acetic acid in lanolin form pegs on the lanolin side. No trans- fer of hormone from seed coat to embryo appears after 24 hours germination, but after 48 hours germ- ination such transfer is indicated by tests such as those shown above. Avena tests show a decrease of hormone in inner coats and an increase of hormone in embryos after 48 hours germination. Similar re- sults were obtained with pumpkin and watermelon seeds. It appears that the embryos contain enough hormone for normal growth but require transfer of an additional amount from the inner coat to produce pegs. The peg appears to be the only plant struc- ture known which depends on hormones for its existence. CELL NUMBER IN THE AVENA COLEOPTILE. G. S. Avery, Jr., II. B. Creighton, Connecticut College, New London, Conn.-In order to better understand the activity of hormones, enzymes, etc. in living tissues, and to evaluate in precise terms any data which may be obtained, the number of cells partici- pating in the reactions must be known. Avena coleoptiles of different lengths (1.5, 4, 10 mm., etc.) were cut into 100/p segments. The total number of cells was determined in each successive segment. As the coleoptile grows longer, the total number of cells decreases in each segment, except at the distal end; the longer the coleoptile the fewer the cells in the basal segments. In coleoptiles of all lengths the number of cells in the tip segment is about the same, and the number of cells increases in successive seg- ments from tip to base. FORM CHANGES IN THE APICAL MERISTEM DURING GROWTH. W. Gordon Whaley, Barnard College, Co- lumbia University, New York, N. Y.-The shape of the shoot apical meristem of Lycopersicon was studied in three dimensions by the construction of models from serial longitudinal sections. The actual meristematic mass was found to have a roughly spiral shape, the form of the spiral changing as the plant matures. Leaf primordia are formed at the lower, differentiating end of the spiraling meriste- matic mass. GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION OF CORN PLANTS IN RELATION TO NITROGEN SUPPLY. Ilda McVeiqh and Paul R. Burkholder, University of Missouri, Columbia, Mo.-Several inbred lines of corn and their hybrids were grown for 6 weeks in four series of nutrient sand cultures with nitrogen (NH4NO3) varied as follows: 0.2, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 9.6 milli- moles per liter of solution. Hybrid vigor, as indi- cated by fresh and dry weights, varied directly with the nitrogen supply, and to a greater or less degree among the different crosses. Thin sections were pre- pared for observations on meristems, parenchyma and vascular bundles. In plants grown on limited nitrogen, phloem was poorly differentiated and the pitted xylem elements were small, thin-walled, and filled with protoplasm. In the same lines and crosses, cut at the same age, but grown on high ni- trogen, the sieve tubes and companion cells were well differentiated and the pitted xylem vessels were large, thick-walled, and without protoplasm. Diameter of the internodes in all plants varied di- rectly with size of parenchyma cells and amount of supplied nitrogen. Development of terminal meri- stems was arrested in plants grown on deficient nitrogen. With increased nitrogen, terminal in- florescences developed at different rates in differ- ent lines, and more rapidly in heterotic crosses be- tween inbreds than in the inbreds themselves. He- terosis is here related to the ability to use nitrogen. Increase in body size with increasing nitrogen sup- ply is dependent upon the specific growth and dif- ferentiation of cells in the different tissues.</page><page sequence="11">PALEOBOTANICAL SECTION ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRESENTED BEFORE THE PALEOBOTANICAL SECTION OF THE BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA, COLUMBUS, OHIO, DECEMBER 28 TO 30, 1939 A NEW CUPULE FROM THE LOWER CARBONIFEROUS OF SCOTLAND WITH A NOTE ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PALAEOZOIC CUPULES. Henry N. Andrews, Jr., Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.-A cupule from the Lower Carboniferous oil shales of Scotland is described as a new genus, the type species of which is Megatheca Thomasi, named in honor of Dr. H. H. Thomas. The cupule is an extraordinarily large (6.2 cm. long) tulip-shaped compression composed of 6 lobes free for two- thirds of their length. Prominent surface reticula- tions are held to represent the original presence of a "Dictyoxylon" cortex. The fossil was found asso- ciated with Telangium afline (L. &amp; H.). The hy- pothesis is put forward that the cupular lobes represent modified (originally sterile) telomes en- closing a group, or groups, of fertile telomes. The latter according to Miss Benson's theory became specialized to form the integument and its enclosed seed. ADDITIONAL NOTES ON ROTODONTIOSPERMUM, A MEDULLOSAN SEED. Waldo E. Steidtmnann, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio.- Newly discovered material of Rotodontiospermum illinoiense, a medullosan seed from the Pennsylvan- ian of Illinois, illustrates the presence of a well de- fined micropyle and slerotestal modifications not observed in the original material. MALE FRUCTIFICATIONS OF THE MEDULLOSACEAE AS ILLUSTRATED BY TWO NEW SPECIES OF DOLEROTH- ECA. James M. Schopf, Illinois State Geological Survey, Urbana, Ill.-In addition to providing abundant material of Medullosa, aff. M. Noei, Roto- dontiospermum, and Alethopteris, aff. A. serli, coal balls from the Calhoun horizon (upper McLeans- boro) have afforded a wealth of material of Dole- rotheca. Their morphology and histology is dis- cussed and evidence presented favoring their clas- sification in the Medullosaceae. At the same time the specific uncertainties of their attribution are emphasized which render it unlikely that biological correlation can ever be sufficiently well established to permit taxonomic merging of any of these genera. It is suggested that Heterangium and Heterotheca from the lower Carboniferous are the best examples of pre-medullosan ancestry now known. Male spores of Heterotheca, Telangium and Crossotheca are characterized as "Filicisporic"; those of the medul- losan alliance as "Dolerosporic." These spore dis- tinctions may be exceedingly useful in outlining the geologic distribution of two maj or pteridosperm divisions. GROSS ANATOMICAL VARIATIONS IN MEDULLOSA, AFF. M. NOEI. Waldo E. Steidtmann, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio, and James M. Schopf, Illinois State Geological Survey, Ur- bana, Ill.-The gross anatomy of Medullosa stems, aff. M. Noei, from the higher McLeansboro Calhoun coal horizon is presented by a series of diagrams. Stelar configurations show considerable variation but most striking of all characters is the distribution of internal periderm. The characteristics of the periderm possibly provide the best available means of judging ontogenetic age of any particular speci- men. For taxonomic purposes, the characteristics shown by the primary wood appear to be of con- siderable significance. PROGRESS REPORT ON INVESTIGATIONS OF OHIO PSARONII. A. H. Blickle, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.-Numerous specimens of silicified Psaronius stems have been obtained from beds of Conemaugh and Monongahela ages in Ohio. A num- ber of new species are described and compared with stems previously identified. The status of the pres- ent investigation of anatomical and morphological features of the material is reviewed with reference to taxonomic interpretation. COAL FLORA STUDIES: LEPIDODENDRALES. Fredda D. Reed, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Mass.-Among the many and diverse plant tissues found in coal balls from Harrisburg, Ill., were frag- ments, both vegetative and reproductive, with ample structural preservation to establish their position in the order Lepidodendrales. Of these fragments there were six species of leaves (Lepidophyllum); rhizome and rootlets of Stigmaria; cone axis, cone scale, microsporangium containing microspores, isolated megaspores of Lepidostrobus; and develop- mental stages of Lepidocarpon. While it is possible that some of the vegetative and reproductive genera might be related and reduced to the same plant, yet the variation within a genus, as in Lepidophyllum, and the new species reported testify to the varia- bility and complexity of the order. MAZOCARPON FROM THE HIGHER MC LEANSBORO BEDS OF ILLINOIS. James M. Schopf, Illinois State Geological Survey, Urbana, Il1.-The morphology of well preserved and abundant male and female cones of Mazocarpon is presented. The mega- and micro-spores are characterized and features of the female gametophyte illustrated. Evidence is presented for favoring a sigillarian alliance for Mazocarpon on a somewhat more sub- stantial basis than previously. With respect to biological considerations it is con- cluded that Mazocarpon has no close affinity with any of the Paleozoic seed-bearing lycopods and re- tains the essentials of the free-sporing habit. The megasporangium is highly developed to a state in- comparable among either the fossil or modern rep- resentatives of Lycopsid plants. lls</page><page sequence="12">12s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. A NEW SPECIES OF CORDAITES FROM THE PENNSYL- VANIAN STRATA OF IOWA. L. R. Wilson and A. Johns- ton, Coe College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa.-Coal ball studies in Iowa have produced manv petrifactions, among which are roots, stems, and leaves of Cor- daites. An anatomical study of the stems show that they are undoubtedly of a new species and most closely related to Cordaites michiganensis Arnold. The name C. iowensis is proposed for the species.

New species from New York deposits are described and illustrative ma- terial exhibited. SOME RELATIONS BETWEEN PALEOBOTANY AND EVOLUTIONARY THEORY (SUMMARY). Edward C. Jef- frey, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.-In recent years the experimental side of the biological sciences has made great progress, a situation which is entirely advantageous. As a consequence the fun- damental fact that biology is to a very large degree an historical science is sometimes lost to view. One consequence of this tendency has been the dimin- ished regard for the biogenetic law or the hypothe- sis of recapitulation. It has been, for instance, ob- jected that the gill arches of the mammalian embryo are not a persistence of structures derived from a fish-like ancestry, but on the contrary represent a physiological adaptation for the respiration of the surrounding amniotic fluid. This criticism loses sight of the unquestionable physiological fact that foetal respiration in the placental mammals is car- ried on through the blood vessels of the placenta. Further, the young mammal has fish-like segmented musculature. Even the rashest experimentalist could scarcely urge that this corresponds to the necessity for swimming about in the maternal amniotic fluid. Even if the criticisms of the recapitulationary hy- pothesis outlined above are frivolous and inaccurate, there may well remain a doubt on account of the extreme interval between fishes and mammals. In the case of the Conifers we have a continuous series from the Paleozoic to the present, which comprises not only external form but important de- tails of internal organization. One relatively ancient group of Conifers is the Araucarians, now confined to the southern hemisphere but once prevalent throughout the world. The Cretaceous Araucarians closely resembled living forms, but presented cer- tain peculiarities, which make impossible the con- ventional view that they are nearly related to the Paleozoic group, the Cordaitales. It is an interest- ing fact that the significant characters of later Mesozoic Araucarians are represented in a recapi- tulationary form in living representatives of the group. As a consequence of this situation, which has many counterparts in the coniferous series, we have to do with the actual persistence of ancestral char- acters in the young of closely related modern forms. To employ the words of a forceful President of the United States, we have to do with a condition and not a theory, particularly as no flight of physio- logical imagination can correlate the ancestral struc- tures persisting in modern Araucarians with any physiological utility. The biogenetic law thus re- ceived new and very strong support from the side of fossil Conifers. Another undesirable tendency is to advance the- ories of relationship or at least of resemblance based on a single character. This situation is well represented by the form genera of Kraus, in which a single characteristic figures as a determinant. Thus we have the terms Araucarioxylon, Cupressin- oxylon, Pityoxylon, etc., based on single characters. The absurdity of the classification even from the standpoint of the mere species maker is clear when it is pointed out that all surviving groups of Coni- fers, except the Abietineae, once had the ligne- ous characteristics of the Cupressinoxylon type. Further, until recently none of the true Araucarian fossil woods has found a place under the form genus Araucarioxylon. The well known Whitby jet, for example, has been referred to- Araucarioxylon un- der the specific title of A. Lindleyi. Jet as a matter of fact belongs on the basis of recent comparative studies to a group very remotely related to Arau- carian conifers. Conversely many woods of true Araucarian affimities beyond question have been re- ferred to Cupressinoxylon. It has been recently pro- posed to refer all fossil woods to the genera of Kraus. In the words of another forceful President of these United States, this would be going back to the horse and buggy days! It can not be too strongly emphasized that the identification of fossil remains can only be satisfac- torily carried out on the basis of comparative ana- tomical characters and can not rest on the single features adopted in the system of Kraus or similar classifications based on characters of organization. It may further be added that the evolutionary as- pects of wood, than which there is no more continu- ous or important biological document, can best be studied in the light of the biogenetic law. THE ORIGIN OF THE PTERIDOPHYTEs. Gilbert M. Smith, Stanford University, Calif.-The theory of a direct origin of pteridophytes from algae is dis- cussed. Green algae are shown to be the only poten- tial ancestors and reasons are given for thinking it very improbable that they evolved directly into pteridophytes. Bryophytes and pteridophytes are considered phylogenetically related because of the many common features. The possibility of their der- ivation from a common ancestor is discussed and then rejected. An origin of pteridophytes from an anthocerotean type of bryophyte is considered the most probable because of the many similarities in sporophytic and gametophytic generations of the two.</page><page sequence="13">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-PALEOBOTANICAL SECTION 13s LATE TERTIARY FLORAS FROM THE GREAT BASIN AND ADJACENT AREAS: THEIR CLIMATIC, FLORISTIC AND STRATIGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE.

Late Miocene and early Pliocene elevation of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade barrier along the western edge of the province resulted in a lowered rainfall and greater extremes of temperature at the north, al- lowing the northward migration of many members of the southern element. Late Tertiary floras distributed from southern Oregon and Idaho southward for 900 miles into the Moj ave and Colorado Deserts, show that the mem- bers of this group are represented in the three gen- eralized communities which may be distinguished over the area at this time-a montane forest at the north, a central woodland association and a desert- border community at the south. The nature of the climate over the region is dis- cussed briefly, later Tertiary floristic changes over the region are indicated, and a basis for correlation is presented. ADOLPH CARL NOE. Fredda D.

Ernest L. Spencer, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, Princeton, N. J.-Sulfanilamide in low concentrations produced marked symptoms of toxicity in Turkish tobacco plants (Nicotiana ta- bacum L.) grown in sand or water cultures. The first symptom is an interveinal chlorosis near the tips of the youngest leaves. As this becomes more severe, terminal growth is retarded but no necrosis appears. Severe cases are marked by the appearance of many strap-shaped leaves. If the chemical is with- held, plants may outgrow the disease soon after its onset. This type of toxicity is apparently dependent on the structure of the sulfanilamide molecule as a whole, for closely related compounds, such as sul- fanilic acid, benzenesulfonamide, p-amino-benza- mide, aniline and p-toluene sulfonic acid produced no symptoms resembling those described. Sulfapy- ridine, which contains the sulfanilamide structure, produced symptoms similar to those described above. A striking similarity was noted between the symp- toms of sulfanilamide toxicity and those characteris- tic of frenching, a physiological disease of tobacco. These observations suggest that frenching of to- bacco may possibly be due to the formation, in the plant or in the soil, of an organic toxin similar in structure to sulfanilamide. THE MINERAL COMPOSITION OF YEAST ASH FROM SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS. Oscar W. Richards and Mary C. Troutman, Research Department, Spencer Lens Co., Buffalo, N. Y.-A pure strain of Sac- charomyces cerevisiae was grown in Williams' me- dium, in Williams' medium enriched, and in malt ex- tract medium. After washing, the yeast was ashed in platinum. Spectroscopic plates were made of ashes of the yeast, of the components of the medium, of autolyzed yeast and yeast extract to determine which elements were present. The following elements were found present in the yeast ash: Ba, Bi, B, Ca, Cr, Cu, Au, Fe, La, Pb, Mg, Mn, P, Pt, K, Ag, Na, TI, Sn, and Zn. Autolyzed yeast contained Al in addi- tion. Most of the trace elements were present in the asparagine, and the large number of impurities present may be a more important reason for its nu- trient value for micro-organisms than its nitrogen content. The importance and origin of the trace ele- ments will be discussed. GLYCOSIDE FORMATION IN PLANTS FROM ABSORBED ETHYLENE CHLOROHYDRIN, O-CHLOROPHENOL AND CHLORAL HYDRATE. Lawrence P. Miller, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Inc., Yon- kers, N. Y.-In a previous report it was shown that potato tubers and gladiolus corms form /8-(2-chloro- ethyl)-d-glucoside from absorbed ethylene chloro- hydrin. Experiments with other plant tissues and with other chemicals have shown that the formation of glycosides in plants from nonnaturally occurring substances can take place quite generally among the higher plants. A crystalline acetyl derivative of a chlorine-containing glycoside formed in tomato plants grown in sand cultures with chloral hydrate added to the nutrient medium has been prepared and the acetyl derivative of the glycoside formed in gla- diolus corms from absorbed o-chlorophenol has also been obtained in crystalline form. Analysis of the latter and comparison with authentic /3-o-chloropbe- nol-d-glucoside tetraacetate showed that, contrary to what might have been expected, the glycoside in question is not /8-o-chlorophenol-d-glucoside but a glycoside not yet identified. Similarly, the chlorine- containing glycoside which has been obtained from tomato plants treated with ethylene chlorohydrin is not identical with that formed by ethylene-chlorohy- drin-treated potato tubers or gladiolus corms. A STUDY OF CELLULAR CHANGES AND DRY MATTER CONTENT IN THE GROWING REGION OF THE PRIMARY ROOT OF COWPEA SEEDLINGS. Mary E. Reid, National Institute of Health, Washington, D. C.-The grow- ing region of the primary roots of young cowpea seedlings was cut into successive segments measur- ing 1, 2, 2 and 5 millimeters in length, beginning at the tip. Some of this material was used for dry weight determinations of the different regions, and similar material was preserved and sectioned for microscopic study of nuclear and cellular activity, the number and sizes of cells and thickness of walls. The relative sizes of cells in the above segments av- eraged 1, 3, 14, and 30, and the dry matter 23, 16, 8.4, and 6.2 per cent, respectively. Whereas, a vol- ume increase of 1,300 per cent occurred during the transition of a cell from the condition in the embry- onic region to that in the region of elongation (third segment), the dry matter increase was 400 per cent per cell. RELATION OF VITAMIN C TO CELL SIZE IN THE GROWING REGION OF THE PRIMARY ROOT OF COWPEA SEEDLINGS. Mary E. Reid, National Institute of Health, Washington, D. C.-Determinations were made of the indophenol-reducing value (vitamin C) of segments of primary roots of cowpea seedlings similar to those described above. A decreasing gra- dient extending from the embryonic zone to the re- gion of maturation was characteristic of the vitamin C values obtained per unit of fresh weight, whereas the content of the vitamin per cell formed a gradient in the reverse direction. A gain of over 700 per cent in vitamin C per cell occurred during its transition from the meristematic stage in segment I to the phase of elongation found in segment 3. The relative amount of increase in volume of the cell was more than twice that of the vitamin.' The increase in dry matter per cell more nearly paralleled that of the vitamin. 14s</page><page sequence="15">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION 15s ANATOMY OF THE STARCH GRAIN. Sophia H. Eck- erson, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Re- search, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.-The method of study used is that of slow disintegration and watching in the microscope as the structural features are uncov- ered. A very satisfactory procedure is: treatment of the grains with 7.5 per cent hydrochloric acid for 10 to 30 days (Hanson and Katz) followed by cal- cium chloride or nitrate on the slide. On the outer part of the grain is a thin membrane-like envelope, elastic and pliable in the young grain from living cells; thicker, hard and brittle on the dry mature grain. Against the inner surface of this envelope is a layer consisting of narrow, concentric bands ce- mented together by a colloidal substance. In the inner part of the grain is a system of radial strands, spreading from the growth center to the inner sur- face of the concentric band layer. The concentric bands and the radial strands are made up of mi- crospherites (Wieler)-tiny, globoid, birefringent units, held together in rows by and covered with a viscous, colloidal substance. Photographs have been made of all these structures, both in their natural position in the grain and isolated from the grain. A DIFFERENTIAL VOLUMETER FOR MICRO-RESPIRA- TION MEASUREMENTS. Kenneth V. Thimann and Barry Commoner, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.-A micro-respirometer of differential volu- meter type is described. By making the experimental vessel small, the control vessel large, and the capil- lary very fine, high sensitivity is obtained, while the use of a relatively large surface of KOH allows rapid CO2 absorption. Solutions can be added quan- titatively without disturbing the measuremnents. A drop movement of 1 mm., which is easily measured, indicates a volume change of about 0.06 mm3. A double water-bath and a shaking device with in- stantaneous release are used. The apparatus enables readings to be made at 1-minute intervals on a single 3 mm. section of Avena coleoptile. EXPERIMENTS ON THE RELATION BETWEEN RESPI- RATION, PROTOPLASM STREAMING AND GROWTH IN THE AVENA COLEOPTILE. Kenneth V. Thimann and Barry Commoner, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.-Using the vessel described above, it has been found that auxin, in concentrations which accelerate protoplasmic streaming, produces very little, if any, increase in respiration in coleoptile sections, whether with or without sugar. The specific effects of a num- ber of respiratory inhibitors on growth and on res- piration have been studied. OXYGEN INTAKE AND CARBON DIOXIDE OUTPUT OF DORMANT GLADIOLUS BULBS. Norwood C. Thornton and F. E. Denny, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.-Gladiolus bulbs, held dormant by storage in moist soil at room temperature, when removed from the soil, show, at first, a very low rate of CO2 output, which then in- creases rapidly until a maximum is reached after 24 to 48 hours. Then there is a gradual return to the original low rate. The rapid output of CO2 in the early stage is not due merely to a release of CO2 previously absorbed in the tissue, since 02 absorp- tion is found to occur concurrently with CO2 out- put. Indeed, for the first 10 to 20 hours following the removal of the bulbs from the soil and preceding the rapid increase in the rate of production of C02, the volume of the 02 absorbed is greater than that of the CO2 released. Finally, there follows, for as long as 14 days, an equal rate of uptake of 02 and output of CO2. During these tests the bulbs are not exposed to change in temperature, and they remain dormant when planted again in soil. RESPIRATION AND OXYGEN REQUIREMENTS FOR GROWTH OF NUPHAR ADVENUM AND OTHER WATER PLANTS. Harlow E. Laing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.-Studies of the respiration and oxygen requirements for growth were made with Nuphar advenum, Typha latifolia, Peltandra vir- ginica, Pontederia cordata, Nymphaea tuberosa, Acorus Calamus, Sagittaria latifolia, Sparganium eurycarpum, Asclepias incarnata, and Scirpus va- lidus. A modified Pettenkofer method was used. Moist gaseous mixtures of air, 10, 4.6, 3.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.4, and 0.1 per cent of oxygen and purified nitrogen were used as media. In some experiments the plant material was immersed in water through which either air or purified nitrogen gas was bubbled. In all species, the rhizomes or corms were able to re- spire anaerobically for unusually long periods of time without any noticeable injury. The oxygen re- quirements for growth were found to vary with the species, the optimum being below one per cent of oxygen for Nuphar advenum, 1 to 3 per cent for Pel- tandra virginica, and approximately 4.6 per cent for Typha latifolia, while Pontederia cordata grew almost equally well in concentrations of oxygen varying from about one per cent to 10 per cent. Maximum root growth occurred in moist air regard- less of the species. Observations were made on the effects of different concentrations of oxygen on the leaves of certain species. HYDROGEN ASSIMILATION IN GREEN PLANTS. H. Gaffron, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.- Oxygen and carbon dioxide are the only gases known to participate in large amounts in the me- tabolism of green plants. Now it has been found that algae of the family Scenedesmus can activate and utilize molecular hydrogen which normally is an inert gas for all plants. When incubated in hydrogen for a few hours in the dark, the algae will begin to absorb hydrogen in connection with several meta- bolic processes. They reduce metabolites as well as molecular oxygen provided the latter is given in small concentration. Even more important seems the reduction of carbon dioxide in the light with the simultaneous absorption of twice the volume of hydrogen. The oxyhydrogen reaction in the dark and the hydrogen photosynthesis are distinct and separate reactions because the photochemical proc- ess is by far the faster one. The rate of carbon diox- ide reduction with hydrogen is proportional to the light intensity, but to a certain degree only. If the light intensity becomes too high, the absorption of</page><page sequence="16">16s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. hydrogen stops and the algae return to normal photosynthesis with the liberation of oxygen. THE RELATION BETWEEN RESPIRATION AND CATA- LASE BASED ON STUDIES OF INTACT DORMANT SEED AND SEED WITH CERTAIN MEMBRANES REMOVED. Wil- mer E. Davis, Kansas State College, Manhattan, Kan.-Seeds were used with dormant embryos that permitted the removal of certain membranes that restrict the gaseous exchange. Seeds of the same lot, both intact and with membranes removed, were placed in an incubator until the respiratory intensity and catalase activity became more or less constant. The respiratory intensity was determined for a num- ber of intact seeds and likewise of seeds with mem- branes removed. The catalase of each set of seeds was determined when removed from the respirome- ter. The ratios of the oxygen used by the intact seeds to that of seeds with membranes removed were quite similar to the ratios of catalase of the same in terms of oxygen released. EFFECT OF THE ROOT ON CHLOROSIS IN THE GRAPE. F. B. Wann, Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Logan, Utah. INFLUENCE OF THE VELOCITY OF CRYSTALLIZA- TION ON THE FREEZING POINT OF LIVING TISSUES. B. J. Luyet and Sister Marguerite Sheeley, St. Louis University, St. Louis, Mo.-Determination of the osmotic pressure of living tissues is often ac- complished by measuring the freezing point of the extruded sap. Freezing point determinations on the tissues themselves furnish values which are consid- erably lower than those of the cell sap and which are of doubtful significance. One of the factors re- sponsible for the lowering of the freezing point in tissues is probably the low rate of crystallization. Callow has found that the velocity of crystallization decreases 350 times when one passes from water to a 3 per cent gelatin solution. If a low rate of crystal- lization lowers the freezing point, then gelatin solu- tions treated as tissues, should present abnormally low freezing points. In comparable experiments, at a moderate, constant cooling velocity, 2.5, 3.7, and 5 per cent gelatin solutions, sub-cooled to -6?C. and ice-seeded, required about 2, 12 and 45 minutes, respectively, to reach the freezing point (constant temperature level). With 7.5 per cent gelatin no freezing point could be reached and with 10 per cent the temperature did not rise at all. DIFFERENTIAL INHIBITION OF INITIATION AND DE- VELOPMENT OF ADVENTITIOUS BUDS OF THE HYPO- COTYL OF FLAX. George K. K. Link and Virginia Eggers, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.-In the Bison variety of flax, decapitated hypocotyls, com- pletely isolated hypocotyls, and hypocotyledonary segments, produce adventitious buds, some of which develop into flowering axes. Severed and set into sand the axes develop functional roots. Bud primor- dia of the lower hypocotyl are laid down early but do not develop further in the intact plant; those of the upper third to half, however, are not even ini- tiated until the hypocotyl is decapitated or com- pletely isolated. Each bud primordium, normal or adventive, of the plant (except in cotyledonary buds) originates in a single, mature, vacuolated epi- dermal cell, by a transverse division without prelimi- nary increase in cytoplasm. This division is followed by many trans- and longi-divisions. The parent cell does not enlarge until several divisions have oc- curred within it. It enlarges radially, mostly out- wardly. One or more adjoining epidermal cells re- peat this performance and become part of the pri- mordium. Cells below the primordium divide and some of their derivatives build the vascular bridge between the vascular systems of the old and new axes. These findings, basic to our studies of the effect of auxins on cellular growth processes in bud initia- tion and development of flax, incidentally indicate that the adventive bud primordia of flax, derived wholly from mature, but totipotent epidermal cells, offer promising material for tissue culture experi- ments. FACTORS INFLUENCING PROTOPLASMIC STREAMING IN THE OAT COLEOPTILE. R. A. Olson, Marine Bio- logical Laboratory, Solomons Island, Md.-The intracellular translocation of substances through liv- ing cells is regulated by protoplasmic streaming. An improved method for observation of the streaming in Avena coleoptiles has been made through the use of unilateral darkfield illumination (parallel light beam, lateral light stop in condenser, darkfield stop in 4 mm. objective, water immersion between con- denser and constant temperature slide, periplane ocular, coleoptile axis parallel to light beam). Pre- cise determination of velocity of streaming can thus be obtained with ease. This method allowed the use of an objective photographic recording, depending upon the length of the streak on a film made by a moving particle during a given exposure. The effect of various substances on protoplasmic streaming has been determined. No increase in rate was caused by ethylether in concentrations below 10 g./l, by 3-in- dole acetic acid below 100 mg./l, by methylene blue below 10-2 molar. At higher concentrations these substances decreased the velocity of streaming. KCN decreased the velocity to about 40 per cent even at concentrations of 0.01 N. EVIDENCE RELATIVE TO THE SUPPOSED PERMEABIL- ITY OF SIEVE-TUBE PROTOPLASM. Otis F. Curtis and Georqe N. Asai, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.- In a series of articles dealing with translocation, Crafts has repeatedly stated that sieve-tube proto- plasm is completely permeable and the cells are in- capable of being plasmolyzed. He has proposed that this complete permeability is necessary for and favors the hypothesis that transport is brought about by a pressure flow through passive phloem. It is claimed that the lateral leakage from the permeable sieve-tubes is prevented by the surrounding living parenchyma cells. If the sieve-tubes were permeable to their contents there would probably be leakage along the phloem parenchyma walls, since these lack the casparian strip which is probably effective in preventing leakage from the permeable xylem cells of the root cylinder. Furthermore, if the phloem were</page><page sequence="17">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION 17s permeable to the contained sap having an osmotic concentration greater than that of the parenchvma cells, the latter would become plasmolyzed and thus open a free path for outward leakage from the phloem. We have found that the phloem exudates from Fraxinus and that from Cucurbita will strong- ly plasmolyze their respective phloem parenchyma cells. This, therefore, demonstrates that the sieve- tube membranes cannot be completely permeable to their contents. We have also found it possible to plasmolyze sieve-tubes if precautions are taken to eliminate the disruption resulting from cutting the tissues before making the tests. INITIAL WATER-SUPPLYING POWER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL AT ONSET OF PERMANENT WILTING IN WHEAT AND COLEUS. Burton E. Livingston and Max Wolf, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.- At field saturation initial water-supplying power is very great for all kinds of soil, at least as great as one gram per square centimeter for the first hour. At beginning of permanent wilting in ordinary plants, its value-measured by means of porous- porcelain soil-point cones with 1-hr. exposure-has been found to vary within the very narrow range between about 2 and about 7 mg./sq. cm./lst hr., being thus practically constant for all soils. This slight variability, which is not clearly related to water-holding capacity or moisture equivalent, has been regarded as probably due to experimental un- certainty of several sorts, but it is now indicated that higher values of this dynamic wilting coefficient are to be expected when the volumetric clay content of the soil is very high. In some recently completed ex- periments, employing wheat and coleus grown in small cylinders of somewhat loamy clay, muck hu- mus, fine sand, and mixtures of these, the value of the coefficient was shown to be low and about the same (16 mg.-23 mg.) for humus, sand and humus- sand mixtures, noticeably greater and about alike (25 mg.-35 mg.) for the mixtures in which the loamy clay comprised about one-half of the soil, and much greater (72 mg.) when the loamy clay was used alone. This relation may perhaps have been due to restricted root growth in the most clayey soils. THE DROUGHT RESISTANCE OF SOME WESTERN GRASSES. Lowell F. Bailey, Grand Rapids Junior College, Grand Rapids, Mich.-The drought resist- ance of Agropyron Smithii, A. ciliare, and Bromus marginatus is considered from the standpoints of (1) their ability to withstand dehydration without injury, and (2) the ability of their underground parts to remain dormant during periods of drought. Agropyron Smithii loses 41.6 ? 1 per cent of its total water content before permanent wilting ensues. Bromus marginatus and Agropyron ciliare lose 49.1 ? 1 and 50.3 ? 1.2 per cent, respectively, of their total water contents before the onset of per- manent wilting. These values indicate only a moder- ate ability to withstand drought without injury. The subterranean parts of all three species remained dormant during a period of six months of severe drought, and produced new shoots when water was added to the soil. After another drought period of six months' duration, only Agropyron Smithii re- sumed growth when water was added to the pots. EFFECT OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY ON GERMINATION OF SPORES OF CERTAIN PARASITIC FUNGI. C. N. Clay- ton (Introduced by B. M. Duggar), University of Wisconsin, Madison, W'is.-Spores of Venturia inae- qualis (Cke.) Wint., Ustilago nuda (Jens.) K. &amp; S., Ustilago hordei (Pers.) K. &amp; S., and Sclerotinia fructicola (Wint.) Rehm were discharged or dusted on clean dry cover glasses which were suspended in sealed containers above sucrose solutions, saturated salt solutions, or water in order to obtain the desired relative humidities, which were computed theoreti- cally. Stratification of atmosphere or solution within containers was minimized and visible condensation upon cover glasses prevented, except at 100 per cent relative humidity, by mechanically rocking the con- tainers in a bath at 20.0 ? 0.020 C. Ascospores of V. inaequalis after 48 hours in redistilled water and 100, 99.62, 99.43, 99.0, 98.65 , and 98.0 per cent relative humidities averaged, respectively, 97.4, 94.4, 50.5, 23.5, 8.2, 0, and 0 per cent germination. Conidia of V. inaequalis after 24 hours in water and 100, 99.6, 99.0, 98.65, and 98.0 per cent relative humidities averaged, respectively, 96.3, 78.5, 52.2, 14.3, 0, and 0 per cent germination. Some chlamydo- spores of U. hordei and U. nuda germinated at 95 per cent relative humidity, none at 93. Conidia of S. fructiola averaged 80 per cent germination in water but failed to germinate at 100 per cent rela- tive humidity and below. BREAKING THE DORMANCY OF BUJDS OF PEAR TREES WITH GLUTATHIONE. John D. Guthrie, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Inc., Yon- kers, N. Y.-Injection of 50 mg. of glutathione in 10 cc. of water into the cut ends of branches of pear trees induced more buds to grow than on control branches treated with water. This is in agreement with similar results obtained with potato tubers (Amer. Jour. Bot. 24: 734. 1937). The stimulative action of yeast extracts on pear buds observed by Bennett and Skoog (Plant Physiol. 13: 219. 1938) may be due to glutathione. AN EXPLANATION OF THE ADVANTAGE OF ALTER- NATING TEMPERATURES OVER CONSTANT TEMPERA- TURES IN THE GERMINATION OF CERTAIN SEEDS. Wil- mer E. Davis, Kansas State College, Manhattan, Kan.-The employment of alternating temperatures in germination of seeds is especially useful in seeds with membranes that restrict the gaseous exchange. When such seeds are subjected to high constant tem- peratures in the germinator, both respiratory inten- sity and catalase activity increase. Duration of this increase depends on the temperature and the extent of the restriction of the oxygen supply; later a de- cline occurs until both become quite constant how- ever long in the germinator. This condition of the embryo is here designated as fatigue and may pass into a condition of true dormancy. When alternat- ing temperatures are employed there is a rise in both respiratory intensity and catalase activity through-</page><page sequence="18">18s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. out the period of germination. No perceptible fatigue is apparent. The period of time required at each temperature of the alternation depends upon the extent of the restriction of the membranes and the temperatures employed. The higher the upper tem- perature of the alternation may be, the shorter is the time required at that temperature, and the longer at the lower temperature in order to prevent fatigue. A RAPID METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE GERMINA- TIVE POWER OF SOME HARD-COATED, DORMANT SEEDS. Florence Flemion, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.-It has been previously shown that the viability of various dor- mant seeds can be determined within a short time by observing the behavior of excised embryos when placed on moist filter paper in Petri dishes at room temperature. Certain seeds, however, may have such extremely tough coats that it is difficult to remove the embryos without injury, and such seeds may also have, in addition, immature embryos. In these cases, certain pre-treatments greatly facilitate excising the embryos. Viability of such seeds, as for example, Symphoricarpos racemosus, can be determined with the following procedure: the coats are treated with concentrated sulphuric acid and the seeds are then mixed in moist peat moss and kept at 5?C. for sev- eral weeks until the embryos have imbibed water and developed sufficiently so that they can be excised and the viability determined within 10 days there- after. A period of one week in moist peat moss be- fore excision also facilitates carrying out the test for other dormant seeds such as Japanese quince, fringe-tree, etc., as well as the hard-coated choke- cherry and wild plum, because not only is the ex- cising easier but the subsequent development on moist filter paper takes place more rapidly. THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXCISED MAIZE EMBRYOS IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF NITROGEN. Carl D. La Rue and James Merry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.-Observations were made on the growth of immature excised embryos of Zea mays in artificial culture on plain nutrient agar with sugar, in air and in nitrogen. The excised embryos in air showed little embryonic development but germinated and grew as small seedlings. In an atmosphere of nitrogen, the growth of the root and shoot was inhibited; the em- bryos did not germinate as did those in air, but showed a development more closely approximating that of the normal embryo in the ovary. CAUSE OF DECREASED GERMINATION OF BEAN SEEDS SOAKED IN WATER. H. Clyde Eyster, University of South Dakota, Vermillion, S. D.-There are sev- eral experiments which prove that bacteria are not the only cause for the decrease in the germination of bean seeds which have been previously soaked in water. (1) The deleterious influence of the soaking process is much less severe at room temperature than at 10?C., at which temperature the bacteria are less active. (2) The proportion of bean seeds' which germinate after having been soaked in run- ning tap water at 130C. for 3 days is the same as that of bean seeds which germinate after having been soaked at 13?C. for 3 days in stagnant tap water, in which bacteria accumulate. (3) Sterilized bean seeds soaked in sterilized water germinate more poorly than control seeds. The decrease in germina- tion of bean seeds Which are previously soaked in water is due primarily to an alteration in the differ- ential permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes. Chemical analyses of the water in which the seeds have been soaked show that there is a loss of proteins and protein constituents from the soaking seeds, and that the remaining germinative capacity of the seeds is inversely proportional to this loss. GERMINATION OF SEED OF POA COMPRESSA L. AND POA PRATENSIS L. AT DIFFERENT ALTERNATING TEM- PERATURES. Alice M. Andersen, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.-Seeds of Poa com- pressa and P. pratensis were sown on soil moistened with water, and on filter paper moistened with water or with N/50 potassium nitrate solution. Germina- tion was studied at 16 different alternating tempera- tures for a period of 28 days. The plants were placed at low temperature for 18 hours and high tempera- ture for 6 hours daily, except when 4 hours is stated for the high temperature. All temperature chambers were dark, except when light is stated. With seeds of P. compressa, the highest percentages of germina- tion were obtained under the following alternating treatments: room and 300; 150 daylight with fan and 300; 150 daylight with fan and 30? for 4 hours; 200 and 300 daylight. In this series, about 80 per cent germination was obtained on soil, 50 per cent on filter paper moistened with water, and 90 per cent on filter paper moistened with nitrate solution. A slightly lower percentage of germination was ob- tained with the alternations as follows: 120 and 300 daylight; 150 daylight with fan and 350; 200 and 300 daylight for 4 hours; 120 and 300; 150 with fan and 30?; 100 and 300. In these, 60 per cent germina- tion was obtained on soil, 35 per cent on filter paper moistened with water, and 85 per cent on filter paper moistened with nitrate solution. Less favorable alter- nating temperatures were: 150 with fan and 300 for 4 hours; 120 and 300 daylight for 4 hours; 100 and 300 for 4 hours; 120 and 300 for 4 hours; 200 and 300; 200 and 300 for 4 hours; 100 and 350. In this group, about 55 per cent germination was obtained on soil, 25 per cent on filter paper moistened with water, and 80 per cent on filter paper moistened with nitrate solution. Seeds of P. pratensis gave prac- tically the same percentage of germination with all 3 substrata. The highest percentage of germination (about 90) was obtained with the following condi- tions: room and 300; 120 and 300 daylight for 4 hours; 120 and 300 dark for 4 hours; 200 and 300 daylight. A slightly lower percentage of germina- tion (about 85 to 88) was obtained with all the other alternating temperatures, except 100 and 350, and 150 daylight with fan and 350 which gave about 80 per cent germination. GROWTH OF CEREAL PLANTS FROM DRY AND SOAKED IRRADIATED GRAINS. Edna L. Johnson, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.-Dry and soaked wheat</page><page sequence="19">Dec., 19391 ABSTRACTS-PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION 19s seeds were exposed to X-ray doses ranging from 1,000 to 60,000 r-units; barley and sorghum, to doses not exceeding 10,000 r-units. Doses up to and including 10,000 r-units did not affect survival of seedlings from dry wheat and barley seeds; 5,000 r-units given soaked grains greatly reduced survival while heavier doses were lethal; but 10,000 r-units and under, given sorghum seeds did not affect seed- ling survival. Noticeable height increases were ap- parent in all three species on exposure to 1,000 and 5,000 r-units. Three groups of dry wheat seeds, one each of soaked wheat, dry and soaked barley, and soaked glume-free sorghum seeds exceeded controls both in height to tip of highest leaf and to tip of head. Plants from dry, glume-free sorghum seeds given 1,000 r-units were taller than the controls. Tillering was considerably increased in practically every group of wheat plants which survived the giv- en dose. Barley from soaked seeds tillered slightly more than the controls. Sorghum plants from glume- free irradiated seeds had a high percentage of plants with more than one main shoot. FLOWER PRODUCTION IN DIGITALIS AND CRASSULA RUBICUNDA BY LOW TEMPERATURE AND LIGHT. John M. Arthur, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Re- search, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.-Both Digitalis and Crassula rubicunda were grown in the greenhouse with night temperatures as low as 550F. for several years without flowering. At this temperature, flowers were not produced under either long days or short days. Digitalis plants set out-of-doors in September came into flower the following June. Plants trans- ferred to an unheated greenhouse on January 11 flowered in June. When the plants were held in a cold room at 50?F. each night and kept in the green- house each day from Mlay 14 until September 30, and then given a long day and a night temperature of 55? to 60?F., flowering occurred in November. Flowers were produced on Crassula rubicunda by similar cold-night treatments except that the low temperature was given from November 14 until April 26. One plant removed from the cold treat- ments in February produced vegetative branches but no flower buds. THE ABSORPTION SPECTRA OF WATER EXTRACTS OF SEVERAL SPECIES OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC PURPLE BAC- TERIA.C. S. French, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill. (Introduced by J. T. Buchholz, University of Illinois, Urbana, Ill.).-In purple bacteria the pig- ments which absorb the light used for photosynthesis exist in solution combined with a protein. Treating a suspension of these bacteria with supersonic vibra- tion breaks the cell wall to liberate the juice contain- ing two pigments, bacteriochlorophyll and a caro- tinoid. Both are attached to a protein which makes these substances soluble in water when they are otherwise soluble only in organic solvents. This com- plex, called photosynthin, can be precipitated and redissolved by changing the salt concentration or the pH of the solution. Such solutions will act as photocatalysts for oxidation of ascorbic acid. Ex- tracts have been prepared from four species, Spiril- lum rubrum, Rhodovibria sp., Phaeomonas sp., and Streptococcus varians, and their absorption spectra measured in the visible and near infra-red. The main band of the bacteriochlorophyll occurs at 875, 855, or 840 m,x depending on the species, while its sec- ondary bands are at 790 and 590 m,u in all the bac- teria examined. The position and height of the bands are the same in the live cells and in the extract. The ability of the organisms to carry on photosynthesis is believed to depend on the properties of this chro- moprotein. USE OF THE DROPPING MERCURY ELECTRODE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS STUDIES WITH CHLORELLA PYRE- NOIDOSA. W. E. Moore and B. M. Duggar, Univer- sity of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.-The following are among the many advantages of the method dis- cussed: no pre-treatment, smaller amount, and less concentration of algae required; accurate measure- ment of transmitted light; very rapid; apparatus simple in manipulation, flexible, and portable; small changes measured; special nutrients may be used; duplicate set-ups for simultaneous runs; and at any point the oxygen level is instantly known. Sugges- tions to aid in the successful application of the meth- od are included in this report. With a number of cul- ture solutions and under different acceptable physi- cal conditions for growth there is little variation in the values for the quantum efficiency. The efficiency as measured is lower than the value reported by Warburg. Data for the quantum efficiency under the following conditions are presented: rat-e of growth; various inorganic media (Warburg, modified War- burg, Emerson, sea-water, A-Z in water, soil extract, city water, tin distilled water, Pyrex distilled water, and lake water); organic additions to the culture; different light intensities for growth and for the efficiency measurement; effect of the transfer from high light to low light intensity; efficiency from two light intensities alone with no dark period; algae from different sources; attempts to kill the cells and continue the run. THE CONTRIBUTION TO PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF LIGHT ENERGY ABSORBED BY CAROTENOIDS IN THE DIATOM NITZSCHIA CLOSTERIUM. Herbert J. Dutton and Win- ston M. Manning (Introduced by B. M. Duggar), University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.-A study has been made of the quantum efficiency of photo- synthesis in the marine diatom Nitzschia closterium, using low intensity light of wave lengths 660, 546, 436 and 405 m,. In conjunction with these experi- ments, a quantitative study was made of the light absorption by the different pigments in this diatom. In contrast to green algae, N. closterium was found to contain a large amount of fucoxanthin but little or no chlorophyll b. The quantum efficiencies were found to be of the same order of magnitude as those found in this laboratory for the green alga Chlorella. A greater quantum efficiency for photosynthesis in N. closterium was found at wave lengths where a large fraction (30 to 70 per cent) of the absorption was due to fucoxanthin and other carotenoid pig- ments than at wave lengths where nearly all of the</page><page sequence="20">20s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY tVol. 2B. light was absorbed by chlorophyll. These results strongly indicate that light absorbed by pigments other than chlorophyll can be utilized by this diatom in photosynthesis. EFFECTS OF MONOCHROMATIC ULTRAVIOLET RADIA- TION ON THE GROWTH OF FUNGOUS SPORES SURVIVING IRRADIATION. Albert E. Dimond and B. M. Duggar, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis. Spores of Rhizopus suinus Niels. were exposed to varying dos- ages of radiation of wave length 2,650 A., and meas- urements of the growth of survivors were made un- der three sets of conditions. First, photomicrographs were made of hyphae in hanging drous at frequent time intervals, and, after enlargement, the areas were determined with a planimeter. Growth curves of individuals over 4-10 hours were established in this manner. The growth response of irradiation survivors was much more variable than was that of unirradiated individuals; also a number of hyphae from irradiated spores grew at a significantly more rapid rate. Second, the growth on Petri dishes of colonies from irradiated spores was compared with that of unirradiated spores. During the time period of 1.5 to 30 hours after the beginning of incubation, the growth rate of the two types of mycelium was identical. Third, comparatively dry weights of my- celial mats produced in liquid culture were followed. From 36 hours onward, growth of the two types of culture proceeded at the same rate. However, growth continued for a longer period in cultures produced by irradiated spores. This resulted in the production of fungous mats which were 20 per cent heavier than mats from untreated spores. PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY OF THE PYRIMIDINE COMPONENT OF VITAMIN B1. Fred M. Uber and Louis A. Fourt, University of Missouri, Coluimbia, Mo.-Ultra-violet absorption curves for 2-methyl-5-ethoxymethyl-6-amino-pyrimidine show a marked dependence on pH, exhibiting two distinct maxima for a pH of 7.0 or more but only one maxi- mum for a pH of 6.4 or less. The positions of the maxima shift with pH. Molecular extinction coeffi- cients vary greatly with molar concentration, par- ticularly for solutions less than 0.000,1 molar. Beer's law is not obeyed at a pH of either 4.8 or 7.8, and presumably not at others. Irradiation of phos- phate buffered solutions, pH 4.8 and absorption maximum of 2,480 A, resulted in a rapid decrease of the selective absorption. This photochemical de- composition of the pyrimidine has been found to yield ammonia nitrogen. ULTRA-VIOLET INACTIVATION OF THE PYRIMIDINE COMPONENT OF VITAMIN B1. Frank Verbrugqe and Fred M. Uber, University of Missouri, Columbia, Mo.-Inactivation of 2-methyl-5-ethoxymethyl-6- amino-pyrimidine has been brought about by irradia- tion at a wave length of 2,537 A. The irradiated solution had a concentration of 0.000,125 molar and was maintained at pH 4.8 in a phosphate buffer. Tests for inactivation were made with cultures of Phycomyces Blakesleeanus, 0.05 cc. of the above solution being added to 250 cc. of nutrient medium and then aliquotted to 10 flasks, which were inocu- lated with sterile spores of the organism. Thiazole was present in all flasks at a constant concentration, which was twice the molar eoncentration of the non- irradiated pyrimidine used as a control. Growth curves of dry weight of cultures as a function of py- rimidine concentration gave a basis for the estima- tion of the inactivation. These curves were linear in the range 0.0125-0.15 X 10-7 molar for cultures grown for 10 days at 240C. EFFECT OF LIGHT OF DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS ON PLANT GROWTH. F. W. Went, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.-Leaf growth, growth in length, phototropism and chlorophyll formation in etiolated pea seedlings is greatly affect- ed by small amounts of light. The spectral sensitiv- ity of each of these processes is very different, indi- cating that different pigments and different light- sensitive reactions are involved in each process. Thus leaf growth is most pronounced in, red, less in yellow and blue, and still less in green, so that its ab- sorption spectrum resembles that of chlorophvll. Growth in length is most decreased by yellow, and least by blue light. Phototropism only occurs in blue and green, confirming older work, and indicating light absorption by carotenoids. Chlorophyll for- mation is equal in red, yellow and green, but dis- tinctly less in blue. EFFECTS OF LIGHT QUALITY ON SERRATIA MARCES- CENS. K. W. Kreitlow (Introduced by Lewis H. Flint), Louisiana State University, University, La. -Radiation studies on Serratia marcescens were carried out by growing tube cultures of the organism on Difco nutrient agar and exposing the cultures to General Eleetric red, blue, and daylight fluorescent lamps. Controls were kept in darkness by wrapping the culture tubes in black photographic paper. Seven isolates of Serratia marcescens were used in these studies and all were found to respond similarly un- der any particular light quality. The most intense pigmentation was found in cultures grown in the dark and under red light. Less pigmentation oc- curred in tubes grown under daylight or white light. Cultures grown under blue light gave very slight to no pigmentation whatsoever. Best results were ob- tained after three or four serial transfers of the or- ganism under light of a particular quality. Maximum gain or loss of pigment resulted after 72 hours of exposure to light of any quality with the cultures being incubated at 20?C. Decrease in pigmentation was also observed when cultures were grown in plain glass tubes exposed to ultra-violet radiation; this loss of pigment was probably due to short blue rays since exposure under filters transmitting only ultra- violet radiation gave almost normal pigmentation. AUXIN CONTENT IN OVARIES AND YOUNG FRUITS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. F. G. Gustaf- son, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.- Various stages of young ovaries and fruits have been used for this study. It may be said that in general the ovaries in the flower bud stage contain more auxin per unit weight of material than do the ovaries</page><page sequence="21">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION 21s of the flower, and as the ovary develops into a fruit there is usually a further decrease. AuXIN CONTENT IN CUSCUTA AND ITS HOST. F. G. Gustafson, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.-Extraction of the growth hormone with ether showed that the part of the host actually at- tacked by the Cuscuta had a much higher growth hormone content than that part not attacked by the parasite. That part of the Cuscuta actually in con- tact with the host had also a higher auxin content than the young free part of the parasite. SOME CHEMICAL AGENTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF OVERGROWTHS ON PLANTS. Michael Levine, Monte- flore Hospital, New York, N. Y.-The effects of in- dole butyric acid and a-naphthalene acetic acid were studied on a large series of plants such as Rici- nus, Cosmos, Helianthus, Lycopersicon, Datura, Brassica oleracea botrytis, Nicotiana glauca, Rosa, Tagetes erecta, and Kalanchoe Daigremontiana. Tryptophane, indole, and a mixture of tryptophane and Phytomonas tumefaciens were also tested on a similar group of plants. Indole butyric acid and a-naphthalene acetic acid produce massive reactions without roots on decapitated sunflower and Jimson weed. On Kalanchoe, broccoli, and Cosmos, these chemicals induce intumescences with roots. Scale- like organoids appear on the Kalanchoe and broccoli. Tryptophane and indole produce small globular masses on the broccoli and N. glauca, while a mix- ture of tryptophane and P. tumefaciens produce discrete crown galls. Suspensions of Sudan III, Su- dan IV, p-aminoazo-benzene, 2-amino-5-azotoluene, and Grubler's scharlach red were also tested on simi- lar plants. These dyes induce only swellings; yet some of these chemicals are known to be carcinogenic for animals. Heteroauxin-induced overgrowths, un- der microscopical examination, show close resem- blance to crown gall tissue. These "chemical tumors" represent a protective mechanism against an irritat- ing agent. THE RELATION BETWEEN RESPIRATION, PROTO- PLASMIC STREAMING, AND AUXIN TRANSPORT IN THE AVENA COLEOPTILE. H. G. du Buy and R. A. Olson, University of Maryland, College Park, Md.-The hormone phenomena of vernalization are dependent upon translocation of certain substances through living cells. Protoplasmic streaming regulates the intra-cellular part of translocation; respiration regulates the streaming velocity, and thus the trans- location. The Heyrovsky polarographic method has been adapted to a dual microrespirometric method for oat coleoptiles. A marked change in respiration rate below a certain 02-tension has been observed, the critical oxygen tension varying with age. Similar age-effects have been found by others for proto- plasmic streaming. Since the reduced rate of respi- ration after KCN inhibition parallels that of the re- duced respiration rate below the critical tension, it is suggested that the respiration system operating at low 02-tension and that not inhibited by KCN are the same. 2-4-dinitrophenol inhibits both the rate of respiration and streaming to the same degree. 3-in- dole acetic acid alone or in the presence of fructose has no effect on respiration except above 100 mg./l. where it decreases respiration and streaming. Since the protoplasmic streaming persists at the lower respiration rate below the critical oxygen tension, the streaming does not depend upon one specific re- spiratory system. Direct transport measurements in oat coleoptile cylinders treated with KCN show that the transport of growth regulators is decreased to the same extent as the respiration and the stream- ing. The concept concerning translocation put for- ward in Biodynamica 36 (1938) obtains herewith further support. EFFECT OF VARIOUS GROWTH REGULATING SUB- STANCES ON THE GROWTH OF LETTUCE SEEDLINGS (VARIETY GRAND RAPIDS). R. B. Stephenson (Intro- duced by H. G. du Buy), University of Maryland, College Park, Md.-Lettuce seedlings are cultured (1) as whole plants, (2) roots and shoots separately, (3) roots and shoots in the same flasks, in sterile media to which special substances have been added in concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg./l. Thiamin and nicotinic acid-treated roots have nearly the same total growth, but branching in nicotinic acid (and naphthylacetamid) is profuse, and minimal in thia- min. Thiourea on roots alone has little effect, but on entire seedlings it produces the largest root system of all series. Naphthylacetamid has the same effect, but less pronounced. Thiourea definitely retards the growth of a pathogenic Fusarium sp. added to the cultures. Roots treated with naphthyl and indole acetic acids are markedly inhibited in their elonga- tion but produce the greatest number of lateral root primordia. Treated shoots produce from two to three times the normal number of adventitious root pri- mordia. When roots and shoots are cultured together, fewer root primordia are formed on the shoots than on shoots which are isolated from the roots; whereas the number induced on the roots attached to shoots is greater than on the isolated roots. Elongation of the roots is inhibited by these substances, but swell- ing of the roots occurs to produce what appear to be artificial root nodules. This effect on root culture makes a simple test to distinguish "true" auxins. THE PRODUCTION AND INHIBITION OF ADVENTI- TIOUS ORGANS AND SOME EFFECTS OF GROWTH SUB- STANCE VAPORS. P. W. Zimmerman and A. E. Hitch- cock, Boyce Thompson Institute, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.-In experiments designed to study initiation and inhibition of adventitious organs, disbudded stem cuttings of Hibiscus syriacus were treated with vapors of growth substances and placed in moist chambers. Both normal and disbudded, non-treated, cuttings served as controls. Controls with normal buds did not form adventitious shoots while disbud- ded cuttings initiated numerous adventitious shoots, associated with the region of lenticels or callus. As many as 75 adventitious buds were initiated on one six-inch cutting, the majority arising from the distal region. A few adventitious roots arose from the basal end, some protruding through the lenticels. The up- per shoots grew fastest and finally inhibited growth</page><page sequence="22">22s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. of other adventitious shoots below. The influence appeared to be of a regulatory nature and due to a natural chemical substance. Cuttings treated with vapors from esters of phenylacetic, indolebutyric, indoleacetic, a-naphthaleneacetic, /3-naphthoxyacet- ic acids, a-naphthaleneacetamide, or ,3-naphthoxy- acetamide showed increased callus formation at wounded areas, proliferation of lenticels, retarda- tion or inhibition of adventitious shoots, and induc- tion of adventitious roots associated with proliferat- ing lenticels and callus. The vapors of indole and naphthalene compounds induced roots from upper middle and lower regions of the cuttings, thus dis- turbing normal polarity and in contrast with adven- titious shoot initiation in controls. COMPARATIVE ROOT-INDUCING ACTIVITY OF IN- DIVIDUAL SUBSTANCES AND MIXTURES. A. E. Hitch- cock and P. W. Zimmerman, Boyce Thompson Insti- tute, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.-Combinations of IB (in- dolebutyric), IA (indoleacetic), and NA (naph- thaleneacetic) acids in talc were applied in propor- tions of 0:4, 1:3, 2:2, 3:1, 4:0, 1:1:1, and 2:1:1 in total concentrations of 2, 5, and 12 mg./g. to cut- tings of chrysanthemum, Euonymus, Hibiscus, and privet. IB, IA, NA, and PA (phenylacetic acid) were applied individually (4 to 64 mg./l.) and with additions of 8 or 16 mg./l. of another substance. In- creasing the proportion or concentration of a sub- stance most active for a given species generally increased the average number of roots per cutting. IB-NA mixtures were more effective for all species than IB-IA or IA-NA mixtures. Mixtures were more active or active over a broader range than individual substances. The activity of IB or NA solutions (4 to 28 mg./l.) was increased by the addition of 8 or 16 mg/l. of a substance which individually showed little or no activity (PA) up to 64 mg./l. These results are not explainable on the basis of a proportional additive effect, dilution, or inactivation. The effec- tiveness of mixtures over a broader concentration range without injury and for more species as com- pared with single substance preparations indicates a possible practical use of such mixtures for rooting cutting;s. FURTHER STUDIES ON THE VEGETATIVE PROPAGA- TION OF SOME GYMNOSPERMS, WITH INDOLE ACETIC ACID. Albert L. Delisle, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.-Experiments were made on rooting cuttings of some forest and cultivated Gymnosperms, which included representative mem- bers of all the tribes of the Coniferales. Particular emphasis was placed on A bies concolor, A bies pec- tinata, Abies koreana, Picea pungens, Picea Omo- rika, Sequoia sempervirens, Sciadopitys verticillata, Tsuga diversifolia, Taxus spp. and var., Podocar- pus neriifolia and Ginkgo biloba. Of the above, with one or two possible exceptions (Ginkgo and Sciado- pitys) it was found that auxin greatly stimulated rooting. The rooting medium and especially the time of year at which cuttings were made determined in large measure the percentages of rooting. For most, best results were obtained with cuttings taken in the late Fall and Winter, and the poorest when taken in mid-Summer. Except in cuttings of Picea pungens, a sand and peat mixture was optimal for rooting. A practical method is offered for the successful vege- tative reproduction of the above named members of the Coniferales. THE HORMONE CONTENT OF MAIZE ENDOSPERMS AS DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT EXTRACTION METH- ODS. G. S. Avery, Jr., H. B. Creighton, and B. Sha- lucha, Connecticut College, New London, Conn.- Endosperms of Canada Flint maize were removed from dormant and germinating grains at following time intervals: air dry dormant seeds, /2 day, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days. Two different extraction methods were used: (1) A known weight of tissue was ground with sand and extracted with (a) chloro- form (Thimann, 1934), (b) alcohol (Laibach and Meyer, 1935; Avery, 1939), and (c) water (Chlo- dony, 1935; Overbeek, 1938); (2) a known weight of tissue was placed directly in ether and allowed to stand overnight at ca. 50C. (Boysen Jensen, 1937; Overbeek, 1938). In all instances the extract was taken up in water, then mixed with agar and the hormone content determined by the deseeded Avena test (Skoog, 1937). Water extracts give the maxi- mum yield of growth hormone from dormant endo- sperms and those at all stages of germination. Sig- nificantly different amounts are obtained by the va- rious alcohol methods and the chloroform method. The greatest differences in yield by the various ex- traction procedures are found in the first 24 hours of germination. Subsequent differences in yield are not as great, but regardless of method, the yield de- creases as germination progresses. At the end of seven days very little growth hormone can be de- tected by any of the methods used. GROWTH HORMONES AND HETEROSIS. G. S. Avery, Jr., H. B. Creighton, and B. Shalucha, Connecticut College, New London, Conn.-One possible ap- proach to a physiological explanation of hybrid vig- or is through a study of growth hormone content of (1) dormant seeds, (2) seedlings, and (3) older plants which exhibit heterosis. Preliminary studies on dormant endosperms of selected inbred lines of maize show no characteristic relationship in hor- mone content between parents and hvbrid, on a per endosperm basis. On the basis of hormone content per gram of endosperm, the F1s are intermediate between the parents. AuxINs OF HYALOPTERUS ARUNDINIS AND OF ITS HOST. George K. K. Link and Virginia Eggers, Uni- versity of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.-Comparative quantitative and qualitative studies were made of the auxins of the aphid Hyalopterus arundinis and of the leaf of Phragmites communis on which it feeds. On the basis of wet weight, the ether extract of the aphid in Avena coleoptile tests is 7-25 times, and on the basis of dry weight, 10-37 times more potent than the leaf extract. Per gram of water, the aphid extract is 3-18 times more potent than that of the leaf. Water, acid, and alkali refluxing, together with color tests of the extracts, indicate that the leaf and</page><page sequence="23">Dec., 19391 ABSTRACTS-PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION 23s aphid extracts each contains the same kind of aux- ins but in different proportions. Auxins which be- have like indole-acetic acid are very much more abundant in the aphid extract. This difference may have its basis in auxins of the honeydew. In view of the fact that sections of the leaf indicate that the aphid derives most of its food from the phloem, the results may indicate that the phloem is the main site of auxins in the leaf of Phragmites communis. DISTRIBUTION OF AUXIN IN SUBTROPICAL FRUIT PLANTS. William C. Cooper and Kenneth R. Knowl- ton, U. S. Subtropical Fruit Research Station, Or- lando, Fla.-Using Van Overbeek's ether extraction method and Went's Avena test, auxin determinations were made on different parts of Citrus and pineapple plants. In Citrus the main center of auxin produc- tion appeared to be in the growing bud with its em- bryonic leaves, old leaves producing little or none. The developing fruit also produces auxin. The auxin in the stem below a fruit or below a flush of new growth was shown to be supplied by the fruit or the flush growth. In the pineapple the center of auxin production appears to be in the embryonic etiolated leaves in the heart of the plant. The ethylene treat- ment to induce blooming in the pineapple had no marked influence on the distribution of auxin in the plant. PRODUCTION OF AUXIN BY TOBACCO CALLUS CUL- TURED IN VITRO. Folke Skoog, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.-A tobacco callus culture ob- tained from Dr. Philip White has been propagated on his synthetic liquid and solid media over a period of seven months in the light, and others for five months in the dark. Determinations of auxin made at successive stages of growth of the cultures show that the callus synthesizes auxin both in light and in darkness. The obtainable amounts of active sub- stance vary with cultural conditions and with the age of the cultures. SOME EFFECTS OF WOUNDS AND WOUND HORMONES Carl D. LaRue, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.-Bacterium tumefaciens produces large tu- mors on leaves of Kalanchoe rotundifolia. If inocu- lated leaves are wounded repeatedly by needle pricks the tumors grow much more rapidly than on unwounded leaves. Hormone extracts prepared ac- cording to Bonner's method and applied in lanolin or by injection, gave similar results. Tumor tissue was induced by wound hormone extracts, but defi- nite tumors did not form. Periderm formation was induced in unwounded stems of Coleus by the ap- plication in lanolin of extracts containing wound hormones. Tyloses are readily induced in young twigs of Morus alba by wounding. They have been produced also by placing the bases of long shoots in a solution containing wound hormones. Control plants developed tyloses only near the basal cut, but those in the wound hormone solution produced tylo- ses far up the shoots. Living twigs of Hibiscus placed in nutrient solutions with sugar stimulate growth of cells from intumescences of the Hibiscus rosa-sinensis. In the absence of living twigs, growth is secured by the addition of extracts containing wound hormones. Wounding induces root formation in petioles of Coleus, stems of willow, Mentha arven- sis, and Sedum sp. Extracts containing wound hor- mones give similar results. THE INFLUENCE OF THE STAGE OF THE REST PE- RIOD ON ROOTING AT THE CUT SURFACE OF POTATO TUBERS. John D. Guthrie, Boyce Thompson Insti- tute for Plant Research, Inc., Yonkers, N. Y.- Pieces of old or non-dormant potato tubers form roots at the cut surface more readily than pieces of freshly harvested or dormant potato tubers when treated with neutralized indole-acetic acid. Freshly harvested tubers rendered non-dormant by treat- ment with ethylene chlorohydrin form roots more readily than untreated controls. FURTHER STUDIES ON GROWTH SUBSTANCES IN RE- LATION TO THE MECHANISM OF THE ACTION OF RADIA- TION ON PLANTS. H. R. C. McIlvaine and H. W. Popp, The Pennsylvania State College, State Col- lege, Pa.-Previous studies (Jour. Agr. Res. 57: 931-936. 1937) were continued with particular ref- erence to the action of regions of the visible spec- trum. Brassica Rapa L. seedlings were grown for 31/2 or 7 days, and periodically irradiated under varying conditions. The sources of radiation were (a) daylight, (b) a 500-watt Mazda lamp, (c) a G. E. mercury vapor lamp in glass, and (d) a mer- cury vapor lamp in quartz. Corning glass filters were used, and, where possible, exposures were such as to equalize the total energies reaching the plants. Ex- posures to varying conditions of daylight and dark- ness were also made. At the end of the series of treat- ments the amounts of growth substance in the seed- ling tips were determined by a modified Went Avena curvature technique. Records of the mean heights of the seedlings indicated a positive correlation be- tween seedling height and the amount of growth substance evidenced in the test. In all cases, results showed that when seedlings are subjected to the shorter visible wave lengths of radiation, the height is less, and there is a smaller amount of growth sub- stance present. Two series of experiments indicated that the growth substance is inactivated to an appre- ciable extent by daylight, and that it tends to ac- cumulate in darkness. NOTE REGARDING TRIMETHYLAMINE AS A PLANT SEX HORMONE. Lewis H. Flint and Fred McGoldrick, Louisiana State UTniversity, University, La.-The injection of potato tubers with aqueous solutions of trimethylamine, carried out as a student's problem in a course in advanced plant physiology, gave re- sults of unusual interest relating to the differentia- tion of flower buds, the production of blooms and the development of secondary flowering from adj a- cent axillary shoots. The results obtained tended to confirm those reported by Professor Havas of Bel- gium in the Science News Letter of November 19, 1938, concerning the efficacy of trimethylamine as a sex hormone.</page><page sequence="24">24s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. MAINTAINING A HIGH POTENTIAL GROWTH RATE IN AVENA COLEOPTILES BY PRE-TREATMENT WITH AUXIN. Charles L. Schneider, Harvard University, Cam- bridge, Mass.-If Avena coleoptiles are pre-treated with low concentration of auxin, then on subsequent treatment with high concentration of auxin the maxi- mal growth rate is as much as fifty per cent higher than that of controls. By using the maximum angle curvature of the Avena test, the increase is enhanced to as much as two hundred per cent. Especially for the maximum angle assay method, there is a sharp optimum curve for the concentration used in pre- treatment, the peak being at about 0.02 milligrams of indole-3-acetic acid per liter of agar, that is, at the concentration giving about ten degrees curva- ture in the Avena test. This kind of pre-treatment is to be distinguished from the "hemi-auxin" pre-treat- ment of Went, for it achieves the opposite results- it increases the maximum angle but not the sensitiv- ity to low concentrations. The effectiveness for pre- treatment of chemically different auxins is a func- tion of their activities; for the less active auxins, not only is the minimal effective concentration higher, but also the optimal response lower. HISTOLOGICAL AND ANATOMICAL CHANGES INDUCED BY INDOLE-ACETIC ACID IN ROOTING CUTTINGS OF PINUS STROBUS. Albert L. Delisle, College of Wil- liam and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.-Cuttings and brachyblasts from 4-year-old seedlings root read- ily with auxin treatment. The hormone causes great increase in the size of the cuttings by stimulating cell division and cell enlargement in certain tissues. The cells of the cortex, and those still remaining of the pericycle, initiate mitotic divisions, soon obliter- ating the cortical canals by the pressure of the ad- jacent dividing cells, thus contributing largely to the increase in the diameter of the cutting. A peri- derm is produced subepidermally, and this gives rise to the callus. The cambium is stimulated to form much secondary tissue, consisting of xylem, phloem and parenchyma. Cambial activity, however, is not uniform throughout. Opposite a congerie of rays, adjacent to the leaf trace, cushions of meristematic cells appear which continue dividing, and soon pro- duce the root primordia which by further cell divi- sions push through the phloem, cortex and periderm, to the outside. The pith is unchanged. Differences in rooting ability between corresponding cuttings of young and old trees seem largely of a physiological nature. Similarly, auxin treated brachyblasts of young and old trees show marked differences in rooting. Unlike rooted cuttings, rooted brachyblasts fail to survive unless adventitious buds have pre- viously been caused to develop in them.</page><page sequence="25">SYSTEMATIC SECTION ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRESENTED BEFORE THE SYSTEMATIC SECTION OF THE BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA, COLUMBUS, OHIO, DECEMBER 28 TO 30, 1939 NOTES ON THE MICHIGAN ALGAE. Alton H. Gustaf- son, Williamst College, Williamstown, Mass.-A number of additions to the algal flora of Michigan have been made. Summary records of the algal popu- lation including data from several previously un- cited papers are assembled. Comparisons are made with the flora of other regions, especially that of Mfassachusetts. NEW MOTILE ALGAAE FROM NEW JERSEY. Harold C. Bold and Tracy E. Hazen, Columbia University, New York, N. Y.-In collections from a small pond in New Jersey the authors found two motile organ- isms which appear to be new. They are both of primitive organization since they lack a firm cell wall; they are, however, of very different affinities. The first clearly belongs to the class Euglenophy- ceae and is probably related to the genus Eutrepti- ella. It differs from Euglena in the possession of two flagella and in the absence of a "gullet" and stigma. Under certain conditions its metabolv is so pronounced that the movement can be considered almost amoeboid. The second organism is a member of the class Chlorophyceae, family Polvblepharida- ceae and is probably a new species of the genus Tetrachloris Pascher and Jahoda, which genus has not been reported before from the United States. The present species is significant in that it brings together characters found in diverse genera and is therefore probably more generalized. This genus Tetrachloris may well be regarded as ancestral to the well known Carteria. A NEW RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION FOR THE GENUS OEDOCLADIUM. Glenn C. Couch, Ohio State Univer- sity, Columbus, Ohio.-The range of distribution in this country for the algal genus Oedocladium has appeared to be limited to the Atlantic Coastal States. The discovery of the genus in the Boston Mountains of Arkansas greatly extends its range. AN OSMUNDA HYBRID. R. M. Tryon, Jr., Gray Herbarium, Cambridge, Mass.-Three sheets of Os- munda in the Gray Herbarium have been identified as 0. Claytoniana L. X regalis L. var. spectabilis (Willd.) Gray. This is the first instance the author has been able to find of a hybrid in the genus Os- munda. The hybrid has characters of both parents, and some intermediate between them. Also, many of the sporangia are abortive. THE PALMACEAE: A UNIQUE TAXONOMIC PROBLEM. Miriam L. Bomhard, U. S. Forest Service, Washing- ton, D. C.-An outline chart of pertinent data and the minimum herbarium requirements necessary for the accurate identification of palms. A NEW SPECIES OF HARTMANNIA. W. H. Horr, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kan.-Closely re- sembling H. speciosa (Nutt.) Small, the plant has been collected in eastern Kansas and western Mis- souri, the main difference being that it is smaller than H. speciosa and that the flowers open pink and fade pink. Ten years of reproduction from seeds have brought no noticeable changes. DESCRIPTIVE METHOD OF LINNAEUS' SPECIES PLANTARUM. Henry K. Svenson, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn, N. Y.-A brief analysis of the components of the Linnaean "descriptions" and re- lationship to pre-Linnaean works. A NEW BEGINNING DATE FOR BOTANICAL NOMEN- CLATURE. Louis Cutter Wheeler, University of Mis- souri, Columbia, Mo.-Such a burden of taxonomic and nomenclatural synonymy has accumulated since Linnaeus' Species Plantarum that it is time to con- sider a new starting date for Botanical Nomencla- ture. To eliminate the present accumulation of use- less synonymy and impose a simplified nomenclature on the science of botanical taxonomy within a single generation would require a second Linnaeus. A series of uniform monographs, much like Das Pflanzenreich, but executed with strict regard for the Rules of Botanical Nomenclature and the type concept, would be bibliographically the most con- venient, and most likely to be universally accepted after the approval of the work by an international body of systematists. Each monograph would estab- lish a new starting date for the nomenclature of the group treated. The change of beginning dates must be voluntarily accepted rather than thrust upon us by any man or small group of men. International participation in the basic monographs would en- courage general cooperation. There are many prob- lems to solve before any plan for a new beginning date can be put into operation, but now is the time to begin. Perhaps by the end of the second century of binary nomenclature we shall have commenced clearing our nomenclatural attic. A STATISTICAL APPROACH TO YUCCA WHIPPLEI. Carl Epling and A. L. Haines, University of Cali- fornia, Los Angeles, Calif.-A method of field study, based upon that employed by Anderson on Iris, is described. The geographic variation of Yucca Whipplei is analyzed and five geographic races or subspecies are described. VARIATIONS OF OPHIOGLO55UM VULGATUM. Robert T. Clausen, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.-As the result of the study of 555 lots of specimens of Ophioglossum vulgatum L., there seems no sound basis for the segregation of subspecies correlated with geographical distribution. The characters avail- able for such segregation appear not fundamental. Shape and size of sporangia vary with the age of the fertile segment. Presence or absence of a basal sheath depends on the degree of weathering (rot- ting) of the leaf stalk of the previous season and, in the case of herbarium specimens, on the degree of 25s</page><page sequence="26">26s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. washing to which the plants have been subjected. Translucence of the blade depends on age. Shape of the blade appears as the best character available, but this is scarcely sufficient for subspecific segrega- tion. Professor Fernald, in a recent publication, the positiveness of which would seem unlikely had it been based on vast series of plants from throughout the range of the species, recognized four varieties, but these several variations occur too generally, both in the Old and New Worlds, to make practical their recognition as geographical races. VIBURNUM PUBESCENS, A POLYMORPHIC SERIES. H. A. Gleason, New York Botanical Garden, New York, N. Y.-V. pubescens is primarily a coastal plain derivative of the Appalachian V. dentatum, varying greatly in the size, shape and texture of its leaves and the distribution and amount of pubes- cence. It also occurs inland, where it has presumably hybridized with Viburnum molle. ORIGINS AND RELATIONSHIPS OF THE FLORA OF A BARRIER RANGE OF CALIFORNIA. Joseph Ewan, Uni- versity of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.-The San Ga- briel Mountains, rising chiefly in Los Angeles County, are a fault-block barrier range, sixty miles long by five to twelve miles wide, lying between the coastal plain and the Mohave Desert. Its flora rep- resents seven components, viz., panarctic, Sierran, Monican, Mohavan, Mexican, Rocky Mountain, and endemic elements. The panarctic element is the weakest today, whereas the Sierran is the strongest. The endemic group includes twelve species and nine subspecies; these have affinities with the Bernardine region to the south and the Coast Ranges to the north, but most often represent plant aborigines which have developed in situ, this range being open for population before adjacent areas. The geomor- phogeny of the range has played a decisive part in the history of the flora, strongly delimiting the spe- cies groups within the range so that eight floristic subareas may be recognized, each with a distinctive geologic history. There are manifest floristic rela- tionships with the Santa Monica, Tehachapi and San Bernardino ranges and also with the distant Santa Lucia and Napa ranges, and the Rocky Moun- tains via Great Basin connections. SOME PROBLEMS OF PLANT DISTRIBUTION IN NORTHWESTERN WASHINGTON. W. C. Muenscher, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.-Results of field studies made during the summers of 1937 and 1939, indicate that the distributions of many plants west of the Cascade Mountains are limited more by the action of climatic and physiological factors than by physical barriers against migration. PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON THE ARBUCKLE MOUNTAINS OF OKLAHOMA. Milton Hopkins, Univer- sity of Oklahoma, Norman, Okla.-In the last two years the identity of numerous plants formerly thought not to occur north of Texas has been ascer- tained. Their discovery in this calcareous area lends additional evidence to the theory that the flora here is an ancient one closely related to that of the Ed- wards Plateau of southwestern Texas which is also of calcareous composition. Previously, few plants were known which were common to both regions of limestone but recent studies have added, among nu- merous others, Cercis reniformis, Quercus texensis, Fraxinus texensis, Rhus Copallina var. lanceolata, Psoralea Reverchonii and Abutilon incanum. THE TAXONOMY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENUS LYCOPERSICON. Cornelius H. Muller, Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C.-The tomatoes, comprising the genus Lycopersicon, are very closely related to the genus Solanum, but the two genera are readily distinguished from one another. The species of Lycopersicon fall naturally into two subgenera, the edible red-fruited species and the unpalatable green-fruited species. The green-fruited group is confined to western South America while the red- fruited group has been spread widely as a result of cultivation. Evidence points to the conclusion that Lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme, the cherry tomato, is the wild prototype of the common Lycopersicon esculentum of horticulture. TAXONOMY OF SYMPHORICARPOS. George Neville Jones, University of Illinois, Urbana, Il.-A genus of the Caprifoliaceae with about 15 species, one Chinese, the others North American and distributed from Alaska to Guatemala. The morphological char- acters of taxonomic and phyletic value are color and size of fruits, shape and size of corollas, leaf-shape, pubescence, habit of plant, and whether prostrate or erect. This is a report of a monographic study begun at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in 1938, and based, in part, upon an examination of nearly 5,000 sheets of preserved material from the principal North American herbaria. HEDYOTIS (RUBIACEAE) AND ITS RELATIVES IN AMERICA. F. R. Fosberg, Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C.-A preliminary survey of ge- neric relationships within the tribe Hedyotidae (Rubiaceae) indicates three possible treatments: (1) To recognize all apparently natural groups of species as distinct genera. (2) To recognize the major ones as genera, appending the smaller or less distinct groups wherever they do least violence to the generic lines. (3) To consider the whole aggre- gation, excepting certain very aberrant groups, as a single large genus, Hedyotis. The various subor- dinate groups would then be arranged as subgenera, sections, etc., in as nearly a natural, phylogenetic scheme as possible. For various reasons, principally lack of profound structural differences between the groups, the latter course is here adopted. Accordingly, the American groups, segregated by various authors as Oldenlan- dia, Kohautia, Clavenna (Lucya), Anotis, Hous- tonia, Arcytophyllum, and probably Teinsolen, may be reunited with Hedyotis. Dentella is maintained as a distinct genus. Lipostoma and its recently de- scribed segregates Standleya and Bradea, until their obvious connection with Coccocypselum can be investigated with more abundant material, are also maintained as separate. On the basis of these ge-</page><page sequence="27">Dec., 1939] ABSTRACTS-SYSTEMATIC SECTION 27s nera, the position of Coccocypselum in a different tribe is questioned. Contrary to most recent usage, the name Hedyo- tis L., according to the International Rules, must be maintained for the aggregate genus, as it was the one selected by J. E. Smith ( 1811 ), the first worker to combine Hedyotis L., Oldenlandia L., and Hous- tonia L. into one genus. THE AREAS OF CONCENTRATION AND ENDEMISM OF THE NEW WORLD LABIATAE WITH REFERENCE TO THE OLD WORLD CENTERS. Carl Epling, University of California, Los Angeles, Calif.-Such areas are il- lustrated and tentative conclusions are drawn as to their interrelationships, which appear to lie wholly North and South. The relationship with the Old World centers appears to be across the North At- lantic. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE OCHNACEAE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENERIC SEGREGATION IN SOUTH AMERICA. John D. Dwyer, Fordham Uni- versity, New York, N. Y.-The family Ochnaceae is limited to tropical Africa and Asia as well as to tropical America. While the African and Asiatic genera are few, the number of species greatly ex- ceeds those of meridional America. Distributional mapping in South America indicates that the com- paratively numerous genera of the Ochnaceae are localized. These narrow distributional centers com- pare favorably with the structural characters that mark the localized genera. The importance of dis- tributional mapping is essential to an understand- ing of the framework of this small but scattered family. PALEONTOLOGY OF PLANTS STUDIED WITHOUT FOS- SILS. Walter T. Swingle, Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C.-Paleontology is commonly de- fined as the science of life in past geologic periods, based on the study of fossil organisms, but much can be learned of the ancient status and subsequent evolutionary changes of plants not vet found as fossils by what may be called paleophylogeny. In connection with a study of all known genera and species of the citrus subfamily (Aurantioideae- Rutaceae) I found that several genera related to Citrus reached Australia some 25 million years ago while it still had land connection to the north, and we can follow their evolutionary development since then. Micro-citrus, closely related to Citrus, is widely distributed in northeastern Australia and has one species in near-by New Guinea. The four Aus- tralian species of this genus represent three very distinct lines of development. Another related Aus- tralian genus, Eremocitrus, has, since the Late Cre- taceous or Early Eocene, become, under semi-arid climatic conditions, a pronounced xerophyte, strik- ingly different from Citrus in appearance but still able to hybridize freelv with it. Other genera of Aurantioideae, and of other plant families when studied in paleophylogenetic perspective, even with- out fossil remains, can be restored substantially as they were tens of millions of years ago; we can even see how they have evolved subsequently at strikingly different speeds. CONTINENTAL DISPLACEMENT AND ITS RELATION TO THIE FLORAS OF NORTH AMERICA. W. H. Camp, New York Botanical Garden, New York, N. Y.- Although Continental Displacement is as yet in- completely understood and subject to a different in- terpretation both as to mechanics and sequence of events from that of the original Wegener hypothe- sis, it affords the botanist a certain comfort in his study of the broader aspects of plant distribution not found in the doctrine of "land bridges." It is held that the South American-African land masses were sufficiently close to be mutually com- municative during the Mesozoic and that the ma- j ority of the basic families of flowering plants evolved there (particularly in South America) dur- ing that time; that the union between these closely associated land masses and Holarctica (the single Asia-North America-European mass), just prior to the Cretaceous, permitted the migration of these plants into what is now the Northern Hemisphere. The northward displacement of the earth's major land masses explains the presence of tropical and sub-tropical plant fossils in the Arctic, as well as the Pleistocene glaciations. It is further held that Holarctica finally disin- tegrated during the late Tertiary and that Europe (the eastern segment) broke away from the mid- portion (North America) and was jotned with the western segment (Asia) no earlier than the Pleis- tocene. A SYMBOLIC METHOD OF REPRESENTING AND COM- PARING CLIMATES FOR PHYTOGEOGRAPHIC STUDIES. Henry T. Darlington, Michigan State College, East Lansing, Mich.-Formulas are developed to indi- cate the essential characteristics of the climates of various regions. It is shown how these formulas may be used in making comparisons between various phytogeographic areas, such as deciduous forest, narrow sclerophyll, grass lands, etc. The year is divided into a number of intervals and relative tem- peratures and precipitations are related in such a way as to give a picture of the essential features of the climate that determine the type of vegetation. WOOD ANATOMY AND TAXONOMY IN THE RHUS COMPLEX. Charles Heimsch, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Mass.-In Barkley's recent monograph concerning the North American species of the Rhus complex, these plants are grouped under six genera: Actinocheita, Metopium, Malosma, Cotinus, Rhus and Toxicodendron. The anatomy of the secondary xylem gives some support to this grouping. Actino- cheita, Metopium, and Malosma are diffuse-porous; the other genera are ring-porous. Only Metopium and Malosma have resin canals in the rays. Meto- pium shows the most abundant paratracheal paren- chyma of all the genera, and it is often banded. In contrast to these diffuse-porous genera which can be distinguished individually, Cotinus, Rhus, and Toxi- codendron show great similarity in xylem organi- zation. It would seem that, on the basis of xylem</page><page sequence="28">28s AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 26. anatomy, these ring-porous genera are on approxi- mately the same level of anatomical specialization. This may be due either to parallelism or close af- finity. FLORAL ANATOMY OF THE KALANCHOIDEAE. ,4lbert H. Tillson, U. S. Plant Introduction Garden, Glenn Dale, Md.-The floral anatomy of 28 species of the three genera comprising the subfamily Kalanchoi- deae (Crassulaceae), was studied in order to de- termine whether the reduction of Bryoph!yllum and Kitchingia to Kalanchoe could be justified on the basis of vascular anatomy. In all three genera, each of the four petal traces is adnate to the correspond- ing antepetalous stamen trace as it leaves the floral axis. In Bryophyllum the petal and stamen traces separate almost immediately, while in Kalanchoe and Kitchingia the petal-stamen bundles remain fused for half the length of the corolla tube. This difference in vascular plans remains constant in all species studied, even though the level of insertion of the stamens varies greatly in each of the genera. The validity of the genera Bryophyllum and Kit- chingia is supported by this anatomical evidence. AN ALKALINE BOG IN NORTHWESTERN IOWA. W. A. Anderson, State University of Iowa, Iowa City.- A hanging bog near Silver Lake, Dickinson County, Iowa, is fed by springs with a high concentration of minerals, and supports a very interesting flora. Over fifty species of plants are listed, of which twelve are extremely rare locally but have wide ranges, espe- cially in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Valley re- gion. Comparison is made with similar local bogs, of which this is one of the richest remaining in the highly cultivated State of Iowa. PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE FLORA OF GRAND MANAN ISLAND, NEW BRUNSWICK, CANADA. E. W. B. Chase, Wayne University, Detroit, Mich.-During the summer of 1938 a plant survey was made on the Island of Grand Manan, lying off the coast of Maine in the Straits of Fundy. A considerable collection was made and identified with the assistance of the Canadian botanist, John Adams, who visited the island later in the summer and checked the plants then in bloom. The geologic formations are briefly discussed together with an outline of the work of previous workers. A list of plants will be given to- gether with a brief discussion of ecological factors. Special mention will be made of the survival of forms brought in in ships' ballast. RECENT TRENDS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEEDS IN KANSAS. Frank C. Gates, Kansas State College, Manhattan, Kan.-During the past half century the number of plants recognized as weeds in Kan- sas has risen from 209 to 372, of which 54 were not present 50 years ago. Distinctly northward or southward migrations are shown by less than ten plants each. Thirty-one plants, all but 2 native, have spread eastward. The largest number, over 125, including several native as well as introduced weeds, old timers and new arrivals, are spreading westward, while 116 have remained within the limits they had in the past century.</page></plain_text>
