PORTRAITURE AND ITS ORIGINS IN GREEK MONETARY TYPES. By E. BABELON. M. Ernest Babelon, Member of the French Institute and one of the Editors of the Revue Numismatique , of Paris, is well known as an eminent numismatic authority. His " Treatise on Greek and Roman Coins," in three volumes, fully illustrated, and his " Historical and Chronological Description of Roman Consular Coins," two volumes, are among the most important modern contributions to numismatic science. In a recent number of the Revue he has discussed the origin of portraiture on Greek monetary types, with special reference to the faces of the " Royal Archer " on the familiar daries of Persia. This is a branch of the science so novel to American coin-students that we have translated his interesting paper for the readers of the Journal ' the first portion of which appears below. - Ed. I. MjKjļļUMSļļ PORTRAIT, as exactly defined by the lexicographers, is a picture made to resemble some individual by means of one O MļĒSļBffl of the arts. In a broader sense, which alone can be adopted from the historic or numismatic point of view, the characteristic quality of a portrait consists in the individu- ' ality of the figure, much more than in the degree of re- semblance, which quite frequently we may find it impossible to appreciate. To distinguish between a portrait and an ordinary figure, ideal or typical, it is sufficient if we are able to recognize a manifest intention on the part of the artist to present a likeness, whether from nature, or based on authentic sources, which beyond question can belong only to an actual person, a real individual. The head of a divinity - Zeus, Apollo, Athena, Herakles, Aphrodite - or that</page><page sequence="2">38 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. of some mythic or legendary hero - Aeneas, Achilles, or Homer - is not a portrait. It is an ideal figure, conventional, an abstract conception. A head of Socrates, of Pericles, or Alexander, whether engraved, sculptured or painted, during the Roman epoch, that is to say many ages after these personages lived, may be classed among portraits if the artist is sustained by historic au- thority ; and this is true even though we may not be able to rely absolutely on its close resemblance to its subject, and find it difficult to decide how far the artist has followed or disregarded tradition. A portrait may be good or bad, idealized or travestied, flattered or a caricature, yet it is still a portrait if it preserves the characteristic individuality which we have defined above. The figures of Vercingetorix, of Charlemagne, of St. Louis, and Joan of Arc, depicted by modern painters and sculptors in warlike or majestic style, enraptured or inspired, are no more portraits than the images of saints or most of the dignitaries which medieval iconography has so often carved in cathedral porches, and painted in the illuminated manuscripts of that period, because, with a few exceptions which we are glad to recognize, the artist has merely copied the models in his studio, and has been unable or unwilling to derive his inspiration from authentic likenesses, or those reputed to be such. On the other hand, the effigies of the Roman Emperors, or of eminent personages of modern times, like Francis I, Henry IV, Louis XIV, or Napo- leon, may be classed among traditional portraits, even though the artist did not live in their time, and has idealized their features : it is enough that he has had a due regard to a probable likeness, in copying models worthy of acceptance, and has conformed to reliable authorities.' In a word, a portrait should profess to reproduce the face of some actual personage. What degree of resemblance the artist has realized, historically, we may often be unable to appreciate ; some ancient portrait which we may consider excellent, might be severely criticised by contemporary judges, from the point of view of its fidelity to its subject. In medallic art, a portrait necessarily has a certain conventional and idealized character, which is especially distinguished by a fixity of type, in strong contrast with the changes produced by time and circumstances in the features and lineaments of the person represented. This is only less true when a reign has been prolonged for many years, and new dies have been made, showing the natural changes in the countenance of the prince, or in the attributes given him. It is therefore a delicate matter, and often not altogether just, to compare coin-portraits which were taken from life, and i "The accuracy of portraits of illustrious men," says Visconti, "loses nothing in copies; the lapse of time can only extend more widely the knowledge of their physiognomy. Thus we can say without fear of error, that the portraits of Leo X, of Charles V, or Henry IV, made to-day, are not less like their originals than those of which they are copies, which were painted while those princes were living."

In the course of this essay, we should not lose sight of this principle - of which it would be easy to cite proofs from contemporaneous coins. At what epoch, or rather at what moment, in the history of art, did the portrait, thus understood and defined, make its appearance? Without at- tempting here to enter into an analysis of this interesting question, it will be sufficient to recall the fact that Egyptian art, of the most remote antiquity, has given us veritable portraits, some painted, others sculptured, which repre- sent not only kings and other persons of exalted rank, but men, women and children of the lower classes of society. In the sculptures of the mastabas the head represented the features of the deceased. The Egyptian statues, especially, surprise us by their individuality, their realistic intensity. Such, among others, are the scribes squatting upon their heels, in the Louvre and at Ghizeh ; the Sheik El Beleb and his wife, the figures of Rahotpu, of Cephre- nes and Cheops, the lady Nofrit, and the colossal head of Amenothis III.1 Then again, the primitive civilizations of Susiana and Chaldea present us with a gallery of portraits in the singular statues discovered by E. de Sarzec, at Tello, and by M. J. de Morgan in the tumulus of Susa. Portraits of the Ninevite monarchs have also been found in the Assyrian sculptures,2 - char- acteristic likenesses in spite of their conventional and hieratic aspect, their perukes, and the grotesque beards which they wear ; these follow a style which was inherited from the Achaemenides, or perhaps from the Arsacides and the Sassanides. The Assyrian sculptors have gone still farther; they have often given to the officials, who surround the king in their bas-reliefs, features which are intentionally very like those of the monarch himself. A comparison of the sculptures of two different reigns, or of two different palaces, shows a striking resemblance in this respect. A similar custom, inspired perhaps by some religious idea, or by respect to the prince, has been observed in the bas-reliefs and paintings in Egypt.3 The most ancient sculpture among the Achaemenides, the successors of the Assyro-Chaldeans, is the famous stele of Méched Mourgab, which has pre- served for us a portrait of Cyrus the Great,4 standing. Although guarded by the four wings (two reversed) which were emblematic of the gods, this figure, in which we cannot fail to recognize a portrait of a well-marked Aryan type, I See M aspero, Histoire ancienne de V Orient class- ique , 1 : 47, 252, 347, 363, 404-408 ; II : pl. to p. 298, etc. ; Paul Girard, la Peinture antique, p. 42, et seq. 2 Fr.

This they also endeavored to do, not only in the bas-reliefs of their palaces, but in their rock-hewn sepulchres. Darius I, the son of Hystaspes, adopted the customs of the- ancient kings of Ņineveh and Babylon even more than did Cyrus and Cambyses ; he " semitized " himself, so to speak. With him and his successors " the abundance and length of their beards were always the emblem of the highest rank." 1 This is the rea- son why the portraits of the royal children are bearded, though preserving in other respects their proper features. Long hair was an emblem of physical strength among the Semitic peoples, as the Bible story of Samson and Deli- lah attests. This common practice of giving to sculptures such apparent uni- formity may lead those who only glance in a hasty and superficial way at the Achaemenidan bas-reliefs, to fail to appreciate the individuality of the royal portraits ; but they will change their opinion very quickly on a more careful study, and will discern true likenesses under the hieratic aspect, stern and cold, of those lineaments. The same maybe said of the numerous representa- tion of royal personages engraved on the conoidal cylinders of precious stones, which these princes used for their official seals. Notwithstanding the minute- ness of the figures, and the inherent difficulties of this department of the glyp- tic art, one will readily recognize, when the engraving is in good condition, the features of the different princes, and their characteristics ; this is also evi- dent on the monuments intended to indicate their personality and kingly position. The Persian coins of the present day lead us to similar conclusions. Let us turn our attention for a moment to Greece, whither historians of art have been accustomed to look. The golden masks placed on the faces of the dead in the royal tombs at Mycene, about the twelfth century B. C., were attempts by the goldsmith to make faithful likenesses.2 And thus the art of Greece before the time of Homer, as well as that of the great civilizations of the Orient, strove to produce portraits, and with some measure of success represented individual faces. Four or five centuries later, after the Dorian invasion, when Greece once more began its artistic education under its new visitors, we see sculpture gradually passing from images of the most rudimentary character to those great marble statues of primitive style and without definite personality, to which archaeologists have given the generic names of Apollos and Athenas. But it has been justly remarked that these, far from being all Apollos and Athenas, were often not even divinities ! It is evident that some at least were merely intended to represent ordinary mortals. i Perrot and Chipiez, Hist, de Vart dans V anti quité, II: 550. 2 Ibid,, VI : 798, 799, and fig. 373 ; W.

But at that time the chisel of the sculptor lacked the requisite skill to give their features a per- sonal character. These votive statues, so far as one can judge, had been ex- ecuted in advance, like many of our funeral monuments to-day ; they repre- sented types of young and attractive girls, with a great variety of coiffures and draperies. The devout Athenian woman bought from the work-shop of the dealer in marble statues that one which pleased her best, and which seemed to her to come the closest to her own likeness. She then caused the artist to carve her name on the base of the statue. This explains the reason why we find on the base of a similar statue of a man, "I am Chares, the son of Cleisis, the son of Teichioussa," which adorned the approach to the temple of the Branchidae at Miletus.1 About 565, B. C., the Phigalians caused a statue of their fellow-citizen Arrachion, victor in the pancratic games, to be erected in the agora of their city ; it resembles the so-called Apollos, just mentioned ; it has the same de- termined yet smiling face, the limbs stiff, the arms close to the body ; but to establish its identity, it needed an inscription on its base, which time had almost effaced when Pausanias described it, who saw it in the second century of our era. The wooden statues of Praxidamas of Aegina, and of Rhexibios of Olympia, which were executed about 550 B. C., like the works of the painter Cimon of Cleonae, the precursor of Polygnotus,2 at once commend themselves by the freedom given to the limbs, and the careful endeavor to preserve the likeness, while its accurate anatomy bears witness to the per- sistent efforts, more and more successful, to follow nature, both in move- ment and life. The decisive step, the complete realization of a veritable Greek portrait was finally accomplished in the funerary bas-relief, as was earlier the case in Egypt. M. Courbaud has very recently proved that the faces of the individ- uals depicted in the famous bas-reliefs known to archaeologists under the names of the stele of the youth with the discus, that of Aristion, the warrior of Marathon, and that of Orchomenus, signed by Alxenor of Naxos, all three belonging to the close of the sixth or the beginning of the fifth century B. C.,3 are true and genuine portraits. We do not propose, in the special subject under discussion, to insist on these and similar examples. We shall only refer the reader to those mentioned by historians of the art, - the portraits painted I Unfortunately the head is lacking. M. Collignon, op. cit., I: 170; G.

C. ; and finally the frescoes of the Poecile by Polygnotus and others, of about the same period, which, we are told, represented the Greek and Persian generals who fought at Marathon. In a word, Greek art at this period had attained to individual and con- crete portraiture, and the first third of the fifth century witnessed the flower- ing out from the archaic period of sculptural skill and portrait-painting. This artistic skill constantly advanced to perfection, so that following the fashion of the time, every distinguished or wealthy citizen intrusted the execution of the sepulchral monuments of those who were dear to him, to sculptors who adorned them with bas-reliefs, in which the most prominent place was given to the deceased, whose features were clearly individualized. The Asiatic princes, like the dynasts of Lycia and Caria, with those of Cyprus and Pheni- cia, imitating Greek customs, made similar demands upon the chisels of the most renowned Greek sculptors, for decorating their tombs with similar bas- reliefs, in which we find figures that impress us by the personality of their faces.1 Thus we come to the fourth century B. C., in which we find a great multitude of statues, figures draped, or standing, busts, simple or those of the " Hermes " style, bas-reliefs and paintings, which have preserved to our own times living memorials, not only of illustrious men like Thucydides, Euri- pides and Isocrates, but of plain citizens and humble municipal magistrates. " The fourth century," says M. Courbaud, " was that when portraiture, not only of eminent personages, but of private individuals, became the popular fashion. The works of Apelles and Protogenes, and their contemporaries or successors, portrayed Alexander, Antigone, Clitus on horseback, the tragic actor Gorgosthenes, the college of Athenian archons, etc." With such abundant evidence before us, the questions we would ask our- selves are the following : - Did the engraving of coin-dies, the products of which made their first appearance in the course of the seventh century B. C., share in this general advance of plastic arts, or did that art alone remain un- developed ? What place shall we assign to the human figure and the individual portrait on monetary types previous to the third century B. C. ? When and how did the portrait make its appearance on the numismatic works of the East, and of Greece proper? Shall we, in numismatics alone, accept the i Courbaud, op. cit., p. 393 ; compare also M.

II. The most ancient coins bear no portraits of the human figure. Some have the type of a sea-tortoise, like the silver pieces which Pheidon began to strike in Aegina ; others, like the electrum staters issued by the Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor, bear devices of various animals, which, in a cer- tain sense, may be regarded as the arms of those cities ; as for instance, the lion on the coins of Miletus, the bull on those of Samos, the stag and the bee of Ephesus, the seal on the issues of Phocis, the griffin of Teos, and the tunny- fish of Cyzicus. On the gold and silver staters of Croesus, we have the heads of a bull and a lion facing each other in combat. On other pieces we see a horse, a boar, a ram, a bull, a sea-horse, a sphinx, an octopus, a cock, an eagle, or an owl. On others again are plants and fruits, such as parsley, the fig, the silphium, the pomegranate ; vases of various forms, stars, rosettes, and other conventional emblems. To these types, derived from animals and plants and the leading articles of the commerce or the local industry of a people, were added in time images of divinities standing, or profiles of men and women who surely are not divin- ities. The most ancient of such figures are : - a female head, doubtless that of Aphrodite, on a silver stater of Cnidos, the rude execution of which and the globular eye recall the stele of Doryleus1 ; on a small electrum coin of northern Ionia, the head of Herakles, of which the singular features, with curling beard, an enormous nose, the eye level with the face, the thick, plaited locks of hair, the large neck, were evidently inspired by the type of the Cyprian and Semitic Melkart.2 The first human likenesses on the coins of the coasts of Asia Minor recall the rare examples of ancient Ionian Greek statues of the same period. Next came, from the same region, about the middle of the sixth century, another feminine portrait, with ear-pendants and a large diadem, prominent cheek-bones, projecting chin, an almond-shaped eye, the hair in thick curls fall- ing on her neck3 ; the grinning mask of a facing Gorgon ; the head of a satyr facing, with flattened nose and the ears of a horse ; the curious head of a warrior with a peculiar crested helmet4 ; an anthropomorphic bull's head with a long beard, doubtless a river-god5 ; the double head of Janus, one profile bearded and the other beardless, of Te nedos ; the head of Aphrodite on the I Babelon, Traité des monn.gr . et rom.,, Part II; De- scription historique, I; 420, and pl. xviii, fig. 9; com- pare the stele of Doryleus in Perrot and Chipiez, Hist, de Vart dans l'antiquité , VIII : 343. 2 Babelon, Descript, hist ., 1:7«;, and pl. iii, fie. o. 3 Ibid., pl. iv, fig. 17. 4 Ibid., pl. xviii, fig. 22. 5 Ibid., pl. iv, fig. 19.</page><page sequence="8">44 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. reverse of the staters of Cnidus ; the bearded head of Ares on the Lycian staters; that of Athena on coins of Sidon, of -Hermes and the Gorgon on those of Cyprus and Cilicia. Before the year 500 B. C., there began to appear on the electrum staters of Cyzicus the heads of anthropomorphic divinities - Zeus, Athena, Hera, Demeter, Zeus Ammon, Dionysos, Atys, and others ; afterwards the Cyzicenes aspired to reproduce some of the more celebrated contemporaneous works of art, such as the running Nike, Herakles in combat, the head of the Discobolus, like that on the stele known as the youth with the discus ; and a head of Typhon, which recalls that of the Typhon of the Athenian Acropolis. We may mention further the head of Athena on the first Athenian staters, so remarkable for the peculiar arrangement of the hair, its eye like that of an owl, its thick lips, half open, and its turned-up chin ; the Gorgon head on coins of Eretria, Neapolis and Pangaea, with curling locks artlessly plaited around the forehead ; the head of the Corinthian Athena ; that of the bearded Dionysos of Aegae, Achaia ; of Demeter and Despoina (Artemis) of Arca- dia ; of the bearded Herakles of Dicaea, Thrace ; of Apollo of Siphnos, and of Zeus Ammon of Cyrene. At the close of the sixth century and in the first third of the fifth, we find in Magna Grecia and Sicily the Hyacinthian Apollo, and the head of Taras of Tarentum ; that of the nymph Hyele of Velia and of Cyme of Cumae ; the bearded Dionysos of Naxos, Sicily ; of Apollo of Leontini ; of the nymphs Arethusa, Segesta and the river-god Gelas, of Syracuse, Segesta and Gela. In a word, everywhere, throughout the entire Greek world, in the East and the West, at a very early period the figures of divinities took a place on coins beside types borrowed from animals and flowers, - concurrently with them, yet without any universal law governing their choice. The selection of these devices and their substitution for the earlier types was determined by local customs or circumstances. In the course of time figures of divinities became more numerous in proportion to the advancing development of art and the increasing number of mints throughout the Greek world. But if these monetary types suggest an interesting relationship to the works of the sculptor, as step by step we trace the progress of the art of engraving in its rendition of the human features in the second half of the sixth century, are we necessarily obliged to consider them as in every case exclusively repre- senting divinities ? Can we doubt that among them we have portraits of liv- ing or historic personages ? Assuming this position, let us turn our special attention from an icono- graphie point of view to those monetary types which, instead of being inspired by local traditions, or mythology, allude to historic events contemporary with</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. 45 the period when these types were engraved. The first of such allusive types relate to the celebration of those public games which held so prominent a place in Greek life. Now is it not possible that in certain exceptional cases, when an engraver placed on his dies the victor in his triumphal chariot or mounted on his race-horse, he sought to flatter the conqueror by reproducing the general outlines of his face, in such a way that all the world would recog- nize it? That this was a common practice on funeral monuments, we have seen above ; why not then attempt it on coins ? Why may not some one have endeavored to outline a characteristic profile of an individual, thus preparing the way for the coming, in due time, of an exact and accurate portrait ? When we find a galloping rider on the coins of Erythrae and Celenderis, or a fighting hoplite on the money of Methymna and Aspendos, a Thessalian mastering a savage bull on Thessalian pieces, a peasant, with a broad Mace- donian hat, driving two oxen, a soldier on foot subduing his horse, or a rider armed with two lances, on the issues of the Thraco-Macedonian region, it is evident that we have before us the conventional figure of some legendary hero, the ancestor of a people, or the founder of a city : it is a typical image of the chosen occupations, or of some prominent chieftain, of the people or the city where the piece was struck. That these monetary types are symbols, goes without saying. . But when, at the beginning of the fifth century, Anaxi- laos, the tyrant of Rhegium, having won the race in the Olympic games in his chariot drawn by mules, placed upon his coins the device which represents him driving his triumphal car, is it rash to suppose that the artist undertook in some instances at least, to give the driver the features of Anaxilaos himself ? To what degree was he successful ? How far was his attempt sincere, and how far influenced by flattery ? On what examples has he sought to repre- sent the tyrant, and on which do we have merely the ordinary type of a vic- torious charioteer? But these are questions of minor importance, which have no bearing on the theory that the burin of the skillful artist was inspired. And indeed, when we examine closely with the glass that little figure seated in his mule-drawn biga, we recognize in it - not indeed on all pieces, but in choice examples - a profile which cannot be classed as a mere common-place piece of work ; the pointed beard, the forceful profile, the intent gaze, give the im- pression of a concrete and personal type.' It is remarkable that this fine portrait, identical in its details, occasionally appears on the coins which Anaxilaos caused to be struck at Rhegium in Cala- bria, and on those which he issued at Messana in Sicily.2 And it is not less i See Babelon, Traite Descript . kist., I: pL lxxi, fig- 13» i 4» '5 (Rhegium) ; pl. Ixxii, fig. 12 and 13 (Mes- sana). 2 The portrait type of Anaxilaos is bearded ; where we find a beardless type (see pl. Ixxii, fig. 12), it is needless to say that it is merely a conventional device of a victorious athlete by an artist who did not dream of individualizing his features. The cutting of coin- dies was entrusted to numerous engravers of varying degrees of skill,</page><page sequence="10">46 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. interesting to note that this bearded figure has no resemblance to those of the victors in the games which form the contemporary types on the money of Leontini, of Syracuse and Gela. In most instances, I am convinced, the agonistic type on the coins of these last cities is but the conventional beardless figure of a charioteer or horseman ; here again there are some exceptions. I cite as one example an archaic tetradrachm of Leontini, on which we have the winner standing in his quadriga, and crowned by a Victory.1 It would seem that some of the rarer coins of Syracuse and Gela may be regarded as sustain- ing our theory, and that they present special peculiarities in the features of in- dividuals. We must not forget that the art of coinage in ancient Greece was essentially subordinated to other arts, following their movement step by step and changing with the fashion of the time. Everywhere the victors in the national games of Greece were held in honor, receiving the highest distinctions and invested with the chief magistracies of their cities ; everywhere it was the ambition of the rulers to win success in the great Pan-hellenic games, and cities erected statues in honor of victorious athletes. It is natural that the devices on local coinage also should recall their triumphs, like the statues erected in public places, and an attempt be made by their fellow-citizens to reproduce the very features of their glorious champions, especially when the right to strike money was in their own hands. As we have said above, it was by these agonistic types that the emblems engraved on coins began to be taken from events in public life, and were no longer exclusively derived from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, or the realms of the gods and legendary heroes. Simultaneously, but without being able to discover the least connection between the two phenomena, we see another human type appearing on coins, which has nothing of the agonistic quality, and to this we will next invite attention. I allude to the royal figure on the money struck by Darius I, the son of Hystaspes (521-485 B. C.), the daric and the Median shekel. III. From the time of Darius I (about 513), until the conquest of Asia by Alexander, that is to say, during nearly two centuries, the coins of "The Great King," almost without variation, bear the same device ; it is that of the prince himself, crowned with the crenelated cidaris, the symbol which dis- tinguishes the satraps or dynasts, who were his tributaries. Bending both knees, the right advanced and the left foot extended backward, his left hand outstretched holds a bow, while with his right he grasps a javelin, its point inclined transversely toward the ground, the upper end of its staff terminating I Babelon, loc. cit.., pl. lxxiii, fig. io.</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. 47 in a ball or " silver pomegranate " On his back is a quiver full of feathered arrows. The candys , or sleeved garment, which he wears, is a large, full tunic of embroidered silk, turned back on his arms and on his left knee, and its lower edge is adorned with scallops and tassels. Such is the well known type of the royal archer, represented as the chief of the " ten thousand Im- mortals," bearers of javelins with silver pomegranates,1 whose pictured ranks range themselves on the many-colored walls of the palaces of Susa and Persepolis. If this type of the Achaemenidan archer remained unchanged, except on certain rare silver coins, so long as the Persian empire lasted ; if it be merely some conventional hieratic form, such as those on the coins of Athens, of Aegina and Corinth, must we consider that the royal features were only a common-place representation of the " king of kings," without iconographie intention ? Or on the other hand, may we not discover, beneath the uniform costume and impersonal attributes, a true and accurate portrait of each of the sovereigns who occupied the Achaemenidan throne ? Long ago I answered this question in the affirmative.2 As my opinion has been disputed, I shall now endeavor to defend and corroborate it, stating it in a definite manner. It is a question of fact, of very minute observation, of classification and com- parison. If we are to discover, as I believe will be the case, a sincere and genuine attempt at portraiture in these figures, as small as those which appear on the coins of the middle ages, one must have experience, and it is important to exaggerate nothing. It goes without saying - and on this point there can be no doubt - that we ought not to expect to find in these little likenesses a perfect resemblance, a rigorous anatomical accuracy surpassing that which we look for in contemporaneous sculptures. To claim this would be absurd, and at once subject me to criticism ; for so long as princes ascend the throne in youth and do not vacate it until far advanced in age, it cannot be supposed that their monetary portraits will follow the successive changes caused by time, such as the gradual modifications of their features, or even the progressive development of their beards, their figure or stature. But we maintain that oftentimes the die-engravers were not limited to producing a vague and ab- stract likeness of the " king of kings," whoever was the occupant of the throne. We believe that we may justly claim that the undoubted differences which exist in these portraits are not to be attributed solely to different engravers, to widely separated mints, or to the skill or carelessness of the workmen. i " The ten thousand chosen Persians [were] called Immortals, because if death or disease of any of them made a vacancy in their number, another was chosen at once to take his place, so that they were never more nor less than ten thousand."

At the beginning of each reign a royal type was adopted, the features of which resembled those of the new prince as closely as possible, and this type, once established, remained with but slight if any alteration, throughout the entire period of his reign, regardless of any change which might occur in the royal physiognomy. We have then only a single type for each ruler ; a type which no doubt has something of a hieratic and conventional character, but is nevertheless analytic and personal. When we find, therefore, two or three varieties in the same reign, it is easy to connect them with each other, as we do the various coin-portraits of Louis XIV ; and in spite of certain diversities, due to the multiplicity of mints, of artists, and occasionally no doubt to some established local custom, we can clearly see that their engravers, in some instances at least, sought to make their work conform to an actual likeness of a sovereign whose reign had long continued. These characteristics are not found on all the coins which have come down to us, and in our iconographie studies we must be careful to exclude the very numerous pieces of careless or barbarous execution ; for these exist in all the series of this money, the mintage of which continued so long and was in such general circulation. Indeed, we find a great number of the Medic shek- els, issued from various Asiatic mints in the fifth and fourth centuries B. C., down to the time of Darius III, Codomannus, and even later, on which the figure of the royal archer is only a silhouette, and more or less barbarous. Some examples of these will be given later. These ordinary pieces do not pretend to give portraits, and their types would serve for any reign ; in fact it would be useless to attempt to assign them to any one of the Achaemeni- dan princes. But beside these, however numerous they may be, there are gold and silver coins of careful, and sometimes even of very delicate workman- ship, as fine as that of the seals engraved on precious stones, on which the attentive observer cannot fail to recognize veritable portraits. Every thing leads us to believe that the daries and shekels with portraits were specially struck in the mints attached to the royal residences, such as Susa and Babylon, or in the cities where the Persian kings were accustomed to go to take com- mand of their armies. In all probability, artists of pre-eminent reputation ex- ecuted these royal portraits from life, rather than from statutes. Engravers of less ability copied these types, reproducing them with more or less fidelity, and often without any great care. We have seen above that the same thing occurred in the agonistic types of Anaxilaos ; we shall find that it obtained in the time of Philip of Macedón, the father of Alexander, and it was not unusual in the middle ages.
