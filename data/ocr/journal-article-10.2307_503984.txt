ETUDE SUR LA SCULPTURE HEL- LENISTIQUE EN RONDE BOSSE DECOUVERTE DANS L ILE, by Jean Marcade (Bibliotheque des ]Ecoles Fran- ?aises d'Athenes et de Rome, fascicule no. 215). Pp. xi + 556, pls. lxxx. Editions E. de Boccard, Paris 1969. The author, a former student of Charles Picard, has lived several months each year for many years on the sacred island of Delos. He has not only studied the pieces in the Museum, as the title implies, but also all the statues scattered outdoors. He has arranged the many thousands of sculptured works not accord- ing to their date, as most other books have done (thus, Gisela Richter in her Handbook of Greek Art [19591 and recently Christine M. Havelock in her Hellenistic Art, The Art of the Classical World from the Death of Alexander the Great to the Battle of Actium [1971]). Instead, Marcad6 writes a monograph on De- los stressing the diversity and originality of its abun- dant sculptural productions (cf. Preface, ixf.). His method for his copious bibliography is origi- nal. Instead of listing the authors alphabetically or chronologically, he discusses the work of his French colleagues in the different fields: sculpture, architec- ture, terracottas (p. i). He quotes the same authors profusely in his ample footnotes. He then describes and excerpts the volumes of L'Exploration archeolo- gique de Dilos and the articles in BCH (pp. 2-14). There are interspersed also single articles from other periodicals like the RA, MonPiot, also a few non- French ones such as the Italian Antichith classica. There follows a discussion of books which treat, for the most part, just a few of the masterpieces found on Delos: Ch. Picard, Sculpture antique and the Man- uel d'archeologie grecque, W. A. Laidlaw, History of Delos, and this reviewer's Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age. Marcad6 remarks that my book has only a hand- ful of Delian works. The Guide de Delos (1966) has only four plates of illustrations (pp. 15-17). Marcad6, in contrast, has not only a complete list even of poorer pieces, but also the finding-place for every piece. Epigraphic sources listed in Inscriptions de Dilos and in the Corpus Inscr. Grae., and inventories are noted (pp. 17-20). The Introduction discusses the favorable situation on this rich and venerable island for Hellenistic religious, as well as profane, sculpture (pp. 21-29). The plun- dering of the treasures of Delos by pirates in the service of Mithridates in 88 B.c. and the subsequent decay have left mostly broken pieces, making research difficult. Marcad6 believes that his research is too early or too late. But by using all kinds of evidence he hopes to find out how Hellenistic art in Delos devel- oped after Athenian archaic and classical influence had prevailed. Delos was settled by a cosmopolitan, mixed population. Marcad6 hopes by an exact analysis of the various documents of archaeology and the study of artists working for Delos, to be able to draw a picture of Delian sculpture, even if it is not quite precise and only approaching the truth (pp. 29-49). The detailed investigation is divided in two parts, the first dealing with the activity of the artists, the second with stylistic components. In the first part, in Ch. I Marcad6 discusses: i) the sculptors who are attested to have worked for Delos, their personalities, signatures and ethnic backgrounds, 2) their customers -public, political or religious groups or private citi- zens, and 3) the question whether the artists came only to fulfill a commission or settled in Delos. Chap- ter II deals with the workshops and their techniques: bronze, wood and mixed technique, marble. In Ch. III, Marcad6 speaks of: i) signed works, such as the Ofellius by Dionysios and Timarchides, and the wounded Gaul, or with dedications, as to the god- dess Roma, 2) architectural sculpture, medallions and busts, 3) herms, which are very common, and 4) the subjects and the types. In Ch. IV the author in- vestigates traditions, variations, and iconographic con- tamination I) of Apollo, 2) of the followers of Apollo and the Dionysiac thiasos, 3) of Artemis, and 4) of Aphrodite and Eros. In the second part of the book, the stylistic com- ponents of schools are analyzed. The author compares, in Ch. I, the art of Delos with the tradition on the Greek mainland, discusses classicizing tendencies and archaistic style. In Ch. II he speaks first of the Ro- man portraits, treated best in an earlier work by Michalowski, Delos XIII, then of the fashions of iconographic representation, and finally of religious images. In Ch. III he compares Delian art with the art of oriental Hellenism. The term "oriental" Mar- cad6 applies to what we call "Middle Eastern": the art of Asia Minor, particularly Pergamon, the art of Syria, Phoenicia and Palestine, and the sculpture for the foreign establishments at Delos. Chapter IV com- pares Alexandrian art with Delian as to i) materials and techniques, 2) typology, and 3) aesthetics. There follows a part called the Conclusion, i.e. "neither school nor general style" (ni ecole ni koine). This, however, ought to belong to Ch. IV as no. 4, since it contains a comparison with Rhodes in regard to their chief analogies and differences. The real conclusion begins with what is called "Appendix: Dates and Style" (pp. 497-502). The au- thor explains why in his attempt to separate the stylis- tic components of the Hellenistic sculpture in Delos he has given little space to chronology, which he finds practically impossible to establish for Delos. The influences of different styles from different places are difficult to date, because they reached Delos at dif- ferent later periods. One can trace the geographical origins of the artists and separate them from those settled in Delos, but these only furnish a terminus post quem. Marcad6 rather divides the material into religious, funereal, political, and decorative groups. Thus, the sculptured images of Apollo, born in Delos, always remain essentially archaistic, those of his sister Artemis, classicizing. Pergamon, Rhodes and Alexan- dria have given to Delos new types for religion and mythology. The influence of Athens, which domi-</page><page sequence="2">1971] BOOK REVIEWS 345 nated Delos until replaced by Rome, transmitted to Delos models for anthropomorphic representations of Muses, Nymphs, Eros and Tyche. At Delos they were, however, not copied but transformed according to the taste of the Delian artists and their clients. This local taste shows itself in the choice of the borrowed sub- jects and the reaction against the generally accepted uniform styles. The transformations are not exact, as in terracottas, but add support and change the atti- tudes and some of the details. Marcad6, with his precise observations, has recog- nized the poor or modest quality of most of the sculp- tures which have remained on the island-the work of artisans, not artists. He distinguishes two phases of the Hellenistic period: the early time of independence and prosperity, and the Roman reign after 166 B.c. In the first period there was no Delian style, but the styles of the different foreign dedicators prevailed. In the second period many foreigners had settled in De- los, and their different tastes are reflected in the sculp- ture. There was no collective tendency. The work- shops began to exchange their techniques, but the foreign influences persisted in the different workshops. Thus Delian art developed slowly. In contrast to the great leading schools of Pergamon, Rhodes and Alex- andria, Delos was only on the way to a local, though modest, sculpture school of its own. Under the im- pulse of the Roman clients a Hellenistic-Roman art was beginning to develop. The catastrophes and dev- astations before the middle of the first century B.c. put an end to this trend (cf. pp. 494f and 502). Marcad6 has, with patience and objective and com- prehensive use of all available sources, compiled a big book which he himself nevertheless considers only a provisional essay. He hopes that, on the basis of new excavations, scholars will be able to find a new way. He stresses the importance of studying the continua- tion of Greek art in the time of the Roman expansion (p. 496). It is necessary to study the adaptations of Hellenistic art to Roman taste and politics. In this the reviewer agrees with the author, especially as she is currently working on Graeco-Roman art in Roman copies. She also admires his meticulous attention to minute details, even to pieces which he himself de- scribes as modest. The reviewer, however, believes that there are too many repetitions in this book, too many questions which are in many cases left unanswered or answered only in a negative or skeptical manner. There are many empty phrases, many digressions which could be cut out. The text might be cut to half the number of pages, which are of large size and have small type and no illustrations. One has the feeling that the au- thor has written down all the discussions of his many problems with his French colleagues, and has neglected to condense them for a concise, printed text. Between the end of the text and the plates Marcad6 has various lists, all compiled with the same atten- tion to minute detail as is the text. After a few addenda and corrections to the text and the footnotes (p. 503), the author gives an extensive list of the plates (pp. 505-512). Each plate gets a caption (missing on the plates themselves) and an enumeration of the single figures with their museum numbers. He deliberately seems to prefer less known or unpublished pieces to well-known masterpieces. He leaves out the portrait heads published by Michalowski-the Ofellius, the Diadoumenos and the small Herculaneum woman in Athens. The table of Delian sculptures mentioned in the text or reproduced on the plates (pp. 513-524) lists the following: i) all pieces preserved in the Mu- seum of Delos, 2) the sculptures outside the Museum, 3) those outside Delos, and 4) a concordance with Michalowski, Dilos XIII. The survey shows that many pieces are illustrated but not mentioned in the text, while others are mentioned but not illustrated. Lists of the principal buildings mentioned (p. 525f), of the principal literary texts mentioned (pp. 527- 53x), and of the epigraphic texts quoted (pp. 532- 540) are followed by a prosopographical index (pp. 541-546), divided into artists and artisans (with par- ticular indication of sculptors), and other persons named, with the rulers, princes, and princesses printed in darker type and the Romans in italics. Finally, there is an index of mythological names (pp. 547- 549). An analytical table of the materials gives a sur- vey of the whole book and takes the place of the usual table of contents and the general index (pp. 551-556). The plates differ in arrangement, and some are rather crowded. They are arranged according to sub- ject matter. Several views of a single piece on one plate are only found for the head of a goddess (for- merly in Athens, now back in Delos) (pl. xxxv), the group with Aphrodite, Pan and Eros in Athens (pl. L), and the head of a Gaul and the statue of a wounded Gaul in Delos (pls. LXXIx and LXXX). Four objects of late sculpture are shown on pl. I; three objects, among them two lions with inscriptions are on pl. ii. Sculptured bases are assembled on pl. iii. Four unfinished sculptures are on pl. iv. Five unfin- ished sculptures, 3 hands, I arm, I foot are assembled on pl. v; 5 arms on pl. vi. Two polychrome statuettes, a head and a bust are on pl. viI; six pieces from round sculpture are on pl. viii. After this the crowding be- gins. Thirteen busts are assembled on pl. ix. Eleven views of three herms (including five of the Hermes Propylaios) are found on plate x, and seven more herms are on plate xi. This series continues with two herms (in four pictures) on pl. xii and four on plate xiii, two (five pictures) on pl. xiv, nine on pl. xv, eight on pl. xvi, two (in four pictures) on pl. xvii. There are six draped herms on pl. xvIIm, and twelve pieces on pl. xix from various herms. On pl. xx there are seven herms representing Hercules, and on the following plate six herms of the Dionysiac cycle. These herms are quite characteristic of Delos, and Marcad6 has dedicated much of his chapter on the archaistic style to them (pp. 291-305). The re- viewer misses, in this well written and documented chapter, references to the best book on archaistic art, by Evelyn Harrison, The Athenian Agora XI. Ar-</page><page sequence="3">346 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 75 chaic and Archaistic Sculpture (1965) 108-I76 pls. 40- 61 (see my review, AJA 70 [1966] 382-386). In re- gard to these archaistic herms, Marcad6 believes that there is no foreign influence which would be Attic, but that for this, as for other groups, religious and cul- tural conservatism is responsible. Plates xxii-xxvii illustrate the followers of Dionysos whose "thiasos," together with that of the followers of Apollo, played a great part on the sacred island. The plates show from four to seven sculptures each. To Apollo himself are dedicated pls. xxvmii-xxxiv, be- ginning with the cult-statue by Tektaios and Angelion and ending with the Muses in the types often at- tributed to Philiskos of Rhodes. The twin of Apollo, Artemis, is represented on pls. xxxVI-XLI in diverse types: in long and short dress, standing quietly, hunt- ing, and--on the well-known bronze relief--sacrific- ing and holding torches, assisted by satyrs (pl. xxxix, cf. pp. 443-447). These plates have six to eleven figures each. Many more figures are given on the plates for Aphrodite, XLII-XLVIII, II-25 pieces per plate. We find again the most diverse types: the Knidian Aphrodite, Coan, Capitoline, Capuan, Arles, Urania, Genetrix and others. There is a great variety in the Hellenistic representations of Aphrodite, both in the bodies as well as in the heads. These and other Delian female heads (pl. XLIx) are parallels to the head in the Brit- ish Museum, declared an original fragment of the Knidian Aphrodite by Iris Love. (This fragment probably comes from a head of Persephone in the style of the 3rd century B.c.; to the same Hellenistic period may belong the round temple and altar dis- covered in her excavation.) Plates LI-LI show children, LIII seated goddesses like Cybele, LIV an archaistic relief with Hermes leading the three goddesses to Paris and an archaistic statuette, a classicizing statuette and a copy of the Athena Medi- ci. To Athena is also dedicated pl. LV, while pl. LVI has other draped female torsos. Plate LvII is dedicated to the Egyptian goddesses, particularly Isis, and pl. LVIII to gods, particularly Serapis and Poseidon. Plate LIX consists of three male statues and eight fragments of Hecate figurines; pl. LX has three male torsos, five arms or hands, and one leg. Plate LXI shows two male statuettes and two votive reliefs, the two in the lower row representing Heracles. The same hero seated or lying fills pl. LXII; Heracles and other youths standing are on pl. LXIII. Plate LXIV has the statue of a servant, a votive relief, a tombstone and three feet; pl. LXV shows Cleopatra and one of the Dioscuri, and the goddess Roma. Many different, draped female torsos appear on pls. LXVI-LXVII; many different male statues and fragments of such are on plS. LXVIII-LXXII, among them Republican Romans. Plates LXXIII-LXXIV show Ptolemaic portrait heads; pls. Lxxv-LXXVII show statues, torsos and fragments of military men, and pl. LXXVIII has nine fragments of riders and horses. This survey illustrates the richness in form and content of the Delian sculptures. The plates are in fact easier to study than the verbose text. The book is difficult to use because on almost every page there are several references to figures, so that the reader must often turn from text to plates. The task is made still more complicated by the arrangement of the ref- erences to the plates, not in the usual way of plate and figure, but by museum numbers, mostly of four digits preceded by an A, before the plate numbers (for ex- ample, A 4139 [pl. xxv], on p. 353)- I would like to make a suggestion to English and German readers. Instead of reading the diffuse text from cover to cover as the reviewer has done, they ought to begin with the Appendix which gives a good summary. Then they may go through the plates and, when they find sculptures which interest them, they can find references to the description and discussion in the text with the help of the table of Delian sculp- tures (pp. 513-521). One can find many carefully written, precise, and thorough passages which will make the effort worthwhile. Marcad' is already well known to epigraphists and archaeologists through his Recueil des Signatures de Sculpture grecs, tcole Frangaises d'Athenes, I, II (Paris 1953, 1957). This new volume will add many archaeologists and art historians to the many scholars who will read or use his books. MARGARETE BIEBER NEW YORK</page></plain_text>
