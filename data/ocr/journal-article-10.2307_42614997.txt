<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMADVERSIONES A Brief Discussion of the Difference between Human and Divine nnn Biblical non is an expression of displeasure that has the potential to precipitate punitive acts of violence1. Though nan is ascribed to both man and God in the Bible, its syntactic behavior differs depending on whether it is used to describe man's anger or the anger of God. When nDn describes human anger, its context highlights the experience of being aggrieved. By contrast, when non describes divine anger, its context emphasizes God's reprisal. We suggest that the distinctive focus of divine nnn on the consequences of provocation instead of on God's own experience of anger reflects a biblical struggle to reconcile the anthropomorphic idea of an emotional God with an omnipotent and invulnerable deity. We begin by discussing human non, and our observations about human nan will serve as the backdrop against which we examine divine rran. I. Human non The noun, nft n, denotes human anger (or excitement) 25 times in the Hebrew Bible2. Whether human non appears in post-exilic texts, as it most frequently does or, texts from an earlier period, its grammatical context highlights the experience of being angry instead of the consequences of anger3. Thus, we see that human nan occurs as the 1 D. Grant, Divine Anger in Biblical Literature (PhD diss. New York University; New York 2009) 1-126. See also B. Baloian, Anger in the Old Testament (American University Studies; New York 1992). Other terms that fit this definition of anger include rroa, oíd, ppt, Din, *]« and 2 Gen 27,44; 2 Sam 11,20; 2 Kgs 5,12; Esth 1,12.2,1.3,5.5,9.7,7.10; Pss 37,8.76,10; Pro 6,34.15,1.18. 16,14.19,19.21,14.22,24.27,4.29,22; Isa 51,13 (2x); Ezek 3,14; Dan 8,6. This list excludes Job 13,13 which requires an emendation, and includes Jer 6,11 which describes Jeremiah as "filled" with God's nan. Other meanings of non in the Bible include poison and fiery wine Deut 32,24; Ps 58,5. 3 nan is especially common in post-exilic texts, only occasionally appearing in earlier texts such as Gen 27,44; 2 Sam 11,20; 2 Kgs 5,12.</page><page sequence="2">The difference between Human and Divine nan 419 subject of verbs that describe the experience of the provoked4, the object of verbs (usually passive) that describe being provoked5, and as an adjective that describes the provoked6. Human nan is a dynamic passion that rises up within an individual and fills him, only to subside or turn away. As the object of a passive verb, nan fills an individual. Haman is filled with nan nan ]on iòa-i (Esth 3,5). Nebuchadnezzar is filled with nan that transforms his face urex -ms]« ctai xan "bann -^nrrQ] pia (Dan 3,19) 7.

It also burns within Ahasuerus (Esth 1,12) only to subside later on ļban nan ļcn (Esth 2,1). The description of nan burning *o mm mam (Esth 1,12) may reflect its etymology. Some scholars suggest that nan derives from the root yhm, which means, "to be hot"8. Perhaps, biblical nan is perceived as embodied heat because the physiological effect of anger is a rise in temperature9. The emphasis of human nan on the state of being angry is indicated not only by the Bible's descriptions of the effects of nan on its bearer, but also by the Bible's descriptions of the effects of nan subsiding. When Ahasuerus' s nan rises, he burns, and when it subsides, he remembers mbu -ite-hdk nxi nnEW-iEK nxi men-nx -dt ermionx ļban nan -]bd (Esth 2, 1). Conversely, Rebecca predicts that when Esau's nan turns away, he will forget ib nx nDüi...-pnx nan hwi--iíz?x iv (Gen 27, 44-45). While both remembering and forgetting can be impactful on others, they do not immediately describe the experience of those being remembered or forgotten. This is made clear in Genesis 27. When Esau 4 E.g. Gen 27, 2; 2 Sam 11,20; Esth 1,12 (with an implicit direct object). 2,1.7,10. 5 As the object of passive verbs see Esth 3,5.5,9; Jer 6,11; Dan 3,19 (Arm. hithpeel). As the object of active verbs see Ps 37,8; Pro 15,1.21,14. 6 E.g. Pro 15,18.29, 22. It also occurs periodically as an adverb that modifies reprisal. See 2 Kgs 5,12; Ezek 3,14; Esth 7,7. 7 The metaphor of containment, being filled with anger, is used to describe the body's experience of anger cross-culturally. For example, in Tunisian Arabic, anger is depicted as a liquid or solid substance that is "contained" in the brain, heart or nerves - R. Hupka, "Anger, Envy, Fear and Jealousy as Felt in the Body: A Five Nation Study", Cross Cultural Research 30 (1996) 260-268. 8 K. Schunck, "nan," Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament (eds. G. Botterweck - H. Ringgren) (Sheffield 1980) IV, 462-465. 9 Tunisian Arabic depicts anger as burning, "He half-boiled my brain to me like a half-cooked egg", and, "He left my blood to boil" - Hupka, "Anger, Envy, Fear", 243-264.</page><page sequence="3">420 Deena Grant hears that Jacob stole his blessing, he experiences hatred and anger, and determines to kill Jacob.

Since it is unlikely that Esau will forget the theft itself, perhaps the passage means to convey that when his anger subsides, Esau will forget his experience of lethal hatred. Either way, the Bible links Esau's hatred to his lethal plan and Esau's anger to his internal state of remembering. Esther 2 also underplays the role of non in punishing the provoker.

II. Divine nan By stark contrast with human non, whose syntactic context either identifies or modifies the experience of being angry, the syntax of divine nan emphasizes the consequence of provocation, nan is applied to God around 90 times. It occurs most frequently as the object of transitive verbs that describe a provocation10, non occurs also as the subject of passive verbs that depict God's reprisal11, and as an adverb that modifies God's punitive act against His provoker12. Additionally, non occurs in the Prophets as part of the curious construct, God's "cup of nan"13. In contrast to humans who are afflicted with their own non, God uses His nan to punish transgressors. As such, whereas human nan is frequently the object of intransitive verbs that describe the experience of being provoked (i.e. rises, abates), divine non is frequently the object of transitive verbs that describe the effects of God's non on His provoker. God repays non to His adversaries rorvb nan cfttzr bvD nftoa bvD (Isa 59,18). He pours out non on the nations that do not know Him -pT-ìò tok D^ian bv ļDDn-ļStB (Jer 10,25).

Num 25,11; Deut 9,19; Isa 59,18; Jer 10,25; Ezek 5,13; Ps 79,6. 11 E.g. 2 Kgs 22,13; Jer 7,20; 2 Chr 12,7. 12 E.g. Ezek 19,12; 2 Chr 28,9; Ps 6,2. 13 Isa 51,17-21; Jer 25,15-33.</page><page sequence="4">The difference between Human and Divine non 421 Both human and divine non are linked to passive verbs. However, whereas human non serves as the object of passive verbs that describe the state of being angry (i.e. to be filled with anger), divine non serves as the subject of passive verbs that describe the trajectory of anger toward its target. This distinct function of divine non is observed most starkly in the relationship of nan to the verb "to burn". Human non burns its bearer (i.e. Ahasuerus burns with non) and divine non burns outward toward an object. God's nan is kindled at His people an nraa K-n -hdk mm nnn nbna--D (2 Kgs 22,13). God's non goes out and burns because of the people's evil Dm^tfD m nDDü ]*w mum ran œxd x*n-]s (Jer 21,12). It burns the forest and everyone/thing that is nearby (Jer 21,14). In other words, when anger is anthropomorphically applied to God, its embodiment as heat is projected outward onto the target of God's anger, thus directing attention away from God's state of being angry14. Throughout the Bible, God's non is concretized as something that is poured15. The verb "to pour", is a surprising modifier of God's anger because human anger, which we might assume is the model for divine anger, is not typically perceived as a concrete substance that can be poured. Nevertheless, in keeping with its typical syntactic contexts, non occurs as the object of the active (transitive) verb form of ļsc? and as the subject of the passive verb forms of dse? and diu God pours out His anger upon Jerusalem cm^i? ran (Ezek 20,8). His anger is poured out upon the dwellers of Jerusalem ram "sk ļrn (Jer 42,18). In keeping with the metaphor of anger as a liquid, Isaiah and Jeremiah ascribe to God a cup of non (Isa 51,17-22; Jer 25,14-16). Isaiah 51 describes the Babylonian disaster as the outcome of God forcing Jerusalem to drink from his cup of non ran oiD-nx mm to nra -iük (Isa 51,17). Similarly, God instructs Jeremiah to make the nations drink from His cup of nan (Jer 25,15). Jeremiah describes God's cup of non as a cup of wine (Jer 25,15) 16 and Isaiah describes its drinkers falling down drunk (Isa 51,21). However, Isaiah states also that the drinkers are not drunk from wine "po íòi mDí&amp;i m]j? (Isa 51,21). If not wine, then just what is within the cup of non? The conception that stands behind the depictions of God's poured non as well as the related descriptions of God's cup of non has intrigued scholars for some time and there is no consensus regarding the Sitz im 14 See also 2 Kgs 22,17; Ps 89,47; Isa 66,15; Jer 4,4. 15 See also Isa 34,2; 2 Chr 34,25; Ps 79,6. 16 In the phrase nonn pn did, both wine and anger possess definite articles. Therefore, the phrase should not be translated as "the cup of wine of anger", but rather, "the cup of wine, the anger". Perhaps a more idiomatic rendering would be, "the cup of wine that is anger".</page><page sequence="5">422 Deena Grant Leben of these descriptions17. In light of our observation that divine nan focuses on its targets, we suggest the substance alluded to in the descriptions of God's poured non and his cup of non is blood. Though human anger is not a tangible substance that can be poured or drunk, human blood is such a substance. In fact, human blood is the substance most frequently described as poured in the Bible18. Moreover, we observed above that Jeremiah 25 describes the cup of non as a cup of wine and Isaiah 51 links it to drunkenness19. In their discussions of God's nan, Isaiah 51,17-21 and 63,2-6 identify wine with blood20. 17 There has been much debate over the Sitz im Leben of the image of God's cup of anger. Following H. Gressmann, W. Holladay, Jeremiah. A Commentary on the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah Chapters 1-25 (Hermeneia; Philadelphia, PE 1986) 673, suggests that the image of the cup of God's anger arose out of an Israelite cultic meal that was held in the sanctuary. According to this theory, drinking from God's cup of wine represents an "anti-banquet ... a grotesque and macabre reversal" of a festive banquet that would have wine. H. Brongers, "Der Zornesbecher", Oudtestamentische Studien 15 (1969) 178-179, disagrees and points out that there is no other food present to indicate a banquet. He suggests, instead, that the substance in the cup of God's anger is poisoned wine (compare to Hab 2,15). W. McKane, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Jeremiah. Commentary on Jeremiah XXVI - LII (ICC; Sheffield 1996) 488, counters that wine itself makes a feast and that Brongers' suggestion does not explain why Jeremiah identifies, at least initially, the drink with wine. McKane ( Jeremiah , 489-491) suggests that given the lethal nature of the cup's contents, the image of drinking is modeled after the "trial by ordeal", outlined in Numbers 5,16-28. While the "trial by ordeal" may or may not be the rite that lies behind the image of drinking from Yahweh's cup, McKane's suggestion suffers from the same sort of problem as does Brongers' model. It does not explain why the prophets identify the substance within God's cup as wine. Hence, it is not surprising that McKane {Jeremiah, 491) accedes "The 'trial by ordeal' model does not itself constitute a sufficient interpretation of the 'cup of wrath' passages, because it does not explain why the contents of the cup should be wine". In fact, he entertains the possibility that the contents within the cup are wine. We point out that neither "anti-banquet" (Holladay, McKane) nor the "trial by ordeal" (McKane) take into account the wartime setting of both Jeremiah 25 and Isaiah 51. 18 See Gen 9,6; Jer 7,6; Ezek 14,9; Ps 79,10. 19 Note that Jeremiah 25 juxtaposes the image of God forcing the people drink wine and fall by the sword against the image of God trampling a winepress to make wine (25,30). With this association, Jeremiah identifies God's production of "red" wine with God's demand that the people drink and be bloodied. Jeremiah 46 reinforces the link between drinking and blood that is spilt by the sword when it describes God's sword drinking the blood of the people (46,10). 20 Isaiah 63,2-6 describes God staining his clothes red with wine when he</page><page sequence="6">The difference between Human and Divine non 423 If blood is, in fact, the substance alluded to in the descriptions of God's liquid non then, again, we see that the focus of divine non is on anger's consequence and not God's experience of anger. By modifying God's non with the verb "to pour", a verb that more aptly describes the consequences of His non - the blood that is poured out of those felled by the sword - the Bible focuses its description of God's non on the experience of God's provokers (Jer 44,3-6; Ezek 9,8.14.19-22). Similarly, by describing God forcing people to drink from His cup of non, the Bible portrays the people swallowing the consequences of their own guilt - their blood that is spilt by the sword21. By identifying God's non with its consequences, the Bible communicates that the people have caused their own downfall. * * * Studies from the fields of religion and psychology suggest that anthropomorphic depictions of divine anger would possess certain features that align closely with biblical descriptions of human anger, and other features that diverge from the human model in order to highlight the distinctive nature of God's divinity22. In support of these studies we have proposed that the syntactic differences between human and divine non reflect broader theological differences regarding the nature of God's anger. We suggest that these differences reveal the Bible's reluctance to cast God as emotionally vulnerable. By applying a recognizably human emotion to God and accompanying it with depictions of divine reprisal, the Bible conveys the danger of transgressing God's will. At the same time, by underplaying allusions to God's inward experience of anger, the trods upon grapes in a winepress. Notably, the passage incorporates anger language into its description of winemaking Ononn noonxi -sia DD-nxi) and wine language into its description of anger ('nona d-dbío 'Sìq cor o*ox*i).

On the contrary, God transforms His nan into an instrument of divine punishment23. College of Arts and Sciences Barry University, USA Deena Grant SUMMARY The term, nan, is a frequent descriptor of anger in the Bible. Notably, its syntactic context depends on whether nan describes human anger or the anger of God. The syntax of human nan highlights the experience of being aggrieved whereas the syntax of divine nan emphasizes the consequence of provocation. As such, human non tends to be the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of passive verbs that describe the experience of being provoked. By contrast, divine nan tends to be the object of transitive verbs and the subject of passive verbs that describe God's reprisal. Additionally, divine nan occurs as part of the curious construct "cup of nan". We believe that these observations reflect an underlying struggle to reconcile the anthropomorphic idea of an emotional God with an omnipotent and invulnerable deity. 23 On anger as a weapon of God see Exod 15,3-8; Isa 10,5-6; Jer 21,6; Hab 3,8-15; Ps 18,7-16.</page></plain_text>
