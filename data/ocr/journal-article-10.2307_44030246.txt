Some essays highlight the interrelationship between literature and other dis- ciplines, cultural climates, topical issues, recent discoveries, or divergent art forms and modes of creative activity. Mosaic's essays also explore emerging trends in theory and literary criticism and address the nature and scope of interdisciplinary study itself. Of the four issues the journal publish- es each year, at least one is a special issue that addresses a topic of contemporary concern. Submission Essays must be submitted on disk, preferably in Microsoft Word, along with three double-spaced and single-sided hard copies. The hard copies and disk must include a 50-word abstract. Please use standard margins and number the pages. Mosaic's blind peer-review process requires that the author's name, as well as postal and e-mail addresses, appear on covering letters; it is important that no identifying information appear on either the hard copy or the electronic version of the essay itself. Covering letters must state that the essay is not part of a thesis or dissertation, has not been published previously, and is not being considered for publication in another journal or medium. Manuscripts will not be returned. Preferred length of essays is 6,500 words, to a maximum of 7,500 words. Parenthetical citations and works cited must follow the conventions of the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing , 2nd edition. Mosaic does not print endnotes or footnotes. Essays may be in English or French and may feature illustrations. If an essay is accepted for publication, securing artwork and permissions for illustrations is the sole responsibility of the author. At time of submission, however, simply attach photocopies of suggested illustrations. Mosaic does not publish fiction or poetry.
