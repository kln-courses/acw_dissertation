After studying at the School of Literature of the University of Waseda from 1951 to 1955, he decided to follow the art of photography and began to work as an independent professional. Ten books by him on "Traditional Dwellings of Japan" were published by Bijiutusu Shupansha of Tokyo between 1957 and 1959 and he received the Mainchi Publishing Award as well. He came to Mexico as a member of the "Central American Studies" group of the University of Waseda where he remained from December 1960 until May, 1961, living mainly in the Maya area and studying its ancient architecture. The extra ordinary photographs illustrating this text were taken during that period. Critics of architecture have said of him, "Nobody has discovered the wonder of architectural space like Yukio Futagawa and rendered it as faithfully as he."</page><page sequence="3">"Five Maya Cities" together with its magnificent photographic illustrations serve as an excellent introduction to one of the greatest of the ancient American cultures. The remains of the grandiose palaces, pyramids, and monuments built and carved by the hands of masters and covered with still undeciphered symbols and hieroglyphics have long attracted investigators and archaeologists to the study of the astonishing culture of the Mayas whom Morley called the Greeks of America because of their esthetic sense and the refinement revealed in the construction and decoration of their buildings. Their exact origins are still unclear but, at its peak, their influence covered a vast area that included southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, Belice, and the northern half of Honduras. Ruined cities are scattered throughout this entire region, all bearing the unmistakable seal of the Maya style of construction and ornamentation. The Classical Period, running approximately from the IVth to the Xth Century A. D., is considered the golden age of this culture. Judging from the characteristic themes of their sculpture, the Maya social organization was a kind of feudal theocracy in which the governing class held absolute power over the people and was the group that cultivated the arts and sciences. The outstanding achievements of the Mayas lay in the fields of astronomy and mathematics in which they reached a higher level than any of the other peoples of America. Not only did their calendar considerably antedate the Julian calendar but it was more accurate. Their observations of the heavenly bodies, carried out over centuries, were also extremely advanced since they were aware of the apparent movements of the sun and Venus. A table for the calculation of eclipses appears in the Dresden codex or manuscript, a truly incredible feat in view of the epoch in which it was accomplished and the means at their disposal. According to the ar chaeologist Spinden, a stone altar in Copan bears carvings representing an astro nomers' congress held in 503 A. D. Their development in mathematics was equally astounding. Not only were they able to carry out highly complex calculations but developed the concept of zero before the Europeans, who had borrowed it from the Arabs. In the Classical Period, the Mayas reached a stage of great perfection in archi tecture, painting, sculpture, and the art of decoration. In architecture, this is at tested to by the sumptuous palaces and majestic temples of their ceremonial cities the ruins of which we may still contemplate, and their great time-defying pyramids. The human figures and strange decorative motifs that adorn their buildings reveal consummate technical skill and a highly refined realistic esthetic concept unmatched in the hemisphere. Their architecture is spectacular and overwhelming: the great squares sur rounded by monuments covered with carved stones and having platforms and magnifi cent stairways are the achievement of a people at the peak of their development, working at full capacity and possessing impressive intellectual capacity and ma terial means. The great Maya empire declines and disintegrates towards the end of the Xth Century of our era for reasons that we can only guess at. The arrival of the Toltecs played a powerful role in influencing the development of the culture of the Mayas, placing its stamp upon the structures whose ruins were discovered in the northern part of Yucatan. The magnificent cities of the Classical Period, abandoned by their inhabitants, were slowly obliterated by the jungle where they lay forgotten for centuries while new centers, Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Mayapan, flourished and became great as a powerful confederation which in turn declined and disinte grated before the arrival of the Spaniards. The Maya culture, nevertheless, cannot be said to be dead. Even though its science has disappeared and been forgotten and the arts lost that were once prac ticed with such skill and devotion by its people, the tradition still lives on vigorously among their descendents in the ancestral customs they observe to this day as a ritual in memory of by-gone times. The Maya language is still spoken by a large sector of the population of the Peninsula of Yucatan, the native craftsmen go on employing technics inherited from their ancestors, while archaic legends remain current as an imperishable legacy of one of the most remarkable of the civiliza tions of the American hemisphere.

Who were the Mayas? Where did they come from? In what ways did they differ from other groups inhabiting the American continent in ancient times? These are some of the many questions that the general reader will find himself asking when he comes upon a description, no matter how good, of what we are today given to call a Maya "city," if it does not supply certain background information, as well. To begin with, he would be surprised to learn that outside of the great temples and palaces, magnificently built of stone, not a single trace exists of dwellings of the same material in which the people might have lived; and that these "cities" were not cities in the same sense as ours but rather great ceremonial or religious centers which were inhabited seasonally only by priests and novitiates. It is quite justifiable to call them civic centers inasmuch as it was there that the community gathered to hold its public celebrations and religious ceremonies. The people farmers in the main, lived in the surounding area close to the fields they cultivated in scattered huts built of perishable materials. In order to enable us to dispel some of the mystery surrounding these strange "cities" now hidden beneath the dense jungle foliage or lost in the immensity of the savannas, it will be necessary to become familiar with the basic facts regarding the culture that produced them. With this knowledge, we will be in a position to appraise these monuments in a more systematic way against a historical and geographical background. THE GEOGRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT The Mayas, who created one of the most remarkable of the New World civiliza tions occupied a very broad area (approximately 325,000 square kilometers). This territory covered almost all of Guatemala, British Honduras, the western part of Honduras and El Salvador, and in Mexico, all of the States of Campeche and Yucatan, the Territory of Quintana Roo and most of the States of Chiapas and Tabasco. This vast sector may be divided into three great natural regions. The first, lying to the southeast, south, and southwest, is delimited by a mountain chain in the form of an arc. The lands in the depression formed by these long mountain folds face north and are dominated by the peaks of majestic volcanoes some of Which are still active. This enormous relief acts as a frame for a series of deep valleys. The Motagua River which rises in the western part of this region flows through one of these valleys and continues its course to the east where it empties into the Gulf of Honduras. Another of the huge rivers that waters these fertile lands in the Usumacinta, known as the Nile of America, which runs south to north to empty into the Gulf of Mexico. The mountain range that demarcates this region is actually an extension of the Sierra Madre of southern Mexico. It becomes considerably lower where it crosses the Isthmus of Tehuantepec but from that point on it rises very high in the southwestern region of the Sierra Madre of Chiapas and in Guatemalan territory. This may be considered the main chain. The other one is usually called the Archaic Range (Cordi llera Arcáica) which stretches from the Motagua River valley as far as Peten, cutting through regions where the Mayas of the so-called Old Empire left deathles relics.</page><page sequence="7">The second region is formed by the plain or great central valley and covers Guatemalan Peten and the southern half of Yucatan. It is partly framed by the same mountain range. This is one of the most lush and fertile areas of the Maya sector because of the multitude of minor rivers and tributaries of the winding Usumacinta that run through it. Blanketing everything are dense tropical forests with gigantic mahogany trees and chicozapote (from which the resinous chicle gum is obtained) which grow as high as two hundred feet. The land surface is broken by many lakes and large swamps and except for a few slight elevations the landscape is quite flat. At the southern and western borders there is a sharp rise to the continental flatlands. The third of these natural regions is formed by the northern half of the Penin sula of Yucatan which is a vast calcareous plain of recent geological formation that slopes towards the sea. The elevations are not nearly as high here and the vegetation is much lower, thinner, and less vigorous than of the great central valley. This is mainly because of the porous and soluble characteristic of the chalky surface which absorbs all the water from the scanty rainfall producing subterranean drainage. As a result, there are almost no rivers on the surface here. The layer of soil covering this region is extremely thin and even though the vegetation grows rapidly it is rarely very tall. Washouts as a result of the erosion of the calcareous stratum by the rain has produced a series of natural wells called cenotes (from the Mayans dz'onot) which expose the underground currents. These cenotes are sometimes as much as 160 feet in diameter. The underground stream is only 16 feet deep at the northern coast but keeps getting deeper as it flows towards the south of the peninsula, until the depth is over 100 feet. In the region it no longer reaches, water is obtained from artificial or natural reservoirs, lakes, or artificial wells or cisterns called cultunes. The water from these lakes or lagoons, however, is often unfit for drinking. Clearly, the geographical environment of the ancient Maya civilization is quite heterogeneous in character. Temperate climate vegetation with conifers in the higher parts and considerable temperature drops in winter are found on the high plateau. In contrast, in Guatemalan Peten and the Usumacinta Valley, there is a predominance of lush tropical jungle vegetation with a hot damp climate and temperature rising as high as to 40° C. in April and May. The northern half of the Peninsula of Yucatan, however, is an extremely dry region with no more than a superficial layer of soil. It has been admirably described by Fray Diego de Landa, one of the colonial chronic lers, to whom we owe most of our knowledge about the Mayas. "Yucatan," he tells us, "is a land of the least land that I have seen as it is all a pure slab and has marvelous little earth so that there would be few parts wherein one might dig more than an estado deep without striking great stone banks. This stone is not very good for fine work as it is hard and rough; albeit, being such, it has served for building the many buildings that there are in this land; is very good for limestone of which there is much, and it passeth wonder that the fertility should be so great of this earth over the stones and among them.. . All that there is there that grows, grows better and in greater abundance among the stones than in the earth, because on the earth that there happens to be in some places, trees do not grow nor are there any of them, nor do the Indians plant their seeds there, and there is nothing there but weeds.. . I believe the reason for this to be that there is more moisture on the stones than in the earth and it is better conserved there." LANGUAGE Different linguistic divisions of the various groups inhabiting the Maya area have been made in recent times with some specialists separating them into six groups, others into seven, and still others into fifteen. Latest research, however, has fixed on ten. Actually, these may be divided into no more than two principal languages, one in the highlands and the other in the lowlands, with various dialectal subdivisions. There is a close relationship among all Maya languages and they are geographically linked throughout their vast territory. Huasteco is an exception, which although belonging to the Maya linguistic family, is not not directly related to the Maya culture because of a geographical barrier. The Maya tongues make up a group similar to that of the Romance languages, some having close affinities like Spanish and Portuguese while other are more dissimilar, like Italian and French. Maya has no close family ties with other Indian languages of Mexico or Central America except for Huasteco, already mentioned, which is considerably separated from the Mayan area by a long strip of land which is today the State of Veracruz.</page><page sequence="8">a) The Huastecano group includes Huasteco which is spoken in one part of what is now the State of Tamaulipas (in the Panuco and Tampico region). Two languages or dialects branch off from it: Potosino and Veracruzano, which are localized in the southeastern part of the State of San Luis Potosí (Tancanhuitz and Ciudad Valles regions) and the northern part of the State of Veracruz (Tantoyuca, Chontla, Amatlan, and Tantoco regions), respectively. Even though localized in the distant settlement of Chicomucelo in the State of Chiapas all the way to the Guatemalan border, eight hundred miles from the Tampico region, the Chicomucelteco subgroup in no more than a dialect of Huasteco. b) The Cholano group comprises Chontal of Tabasco which is spoken in the region of the mouths of the Grijaiva and Usumacinta Rivers; Choi, formerly spoken in the tropical forest zone of the Rio de la Pasión region, to the north of Lake Izabal, midway along the Usumacinta River, and in the region of the Jatate, Lacanha, and Lacantun Rivers and now used in the western part of Palenque. Chorti is still spoken on both sides of the Honduras-Guatemala border and in the Quetzaltepec and Copan regions. c) Tzeltalano includes Tzeltal, Tzotzil, and Toholabal, which are still spoken in the present State of Chiapas. Tzeltal is found in the central part of Chiapas, around Ocosingo and near the Guatemalan border. Tzotzil or Chamula is spoken by over 60,000 inhabitants of the State of Chiapas in the Simojovel and San Cristobal las Casas areas. Toholabal, also spoken in Chiapas, is localized in the eastern part of the state in the Municipios of Comitan, La Trinitaria, Independencia, and Las Margaritas. e) Kanhobalano, spoken in Guatemala, is subdivided into the following dialects: Jacalteco, in Jacalteco; Kanhobal, from San Jose Montenegro, near the Guatemala Mexico border, to San Juan Ixcoy and Santa Cruz Earillas; and Solomeco, in San Pedro Soloma. f) Motozintleco is spoken around Motozintla, in the southern part of the State of Chiapas, bordering Guatemala. g) Mameano. Man or Mame is spoken on both sides of the Mexico-Guatemala border. At the present time, the Mame group is made up of 300,000 persons who no longer speak their original language because of closer contacts with the Spanish speaking population; this is particulary true on the Chiapas side of the border. Aguacateco, part of the same group, is still spoken by about 8,000 persons in the Guatemalan village of Aguacatan. Ixil has about 20,000 speakers in the Nabaj, Cotzal, and Chahu regions in the northwestern part of the Mame territory, also in Guatemala. h) Quicheano. This group comprises the following languages: Quiche, Rabinal, Kakchiquel, Uspanteco and Tzutuhil. Quiche, which was very important in ancient times, is still spoken today in a broad area of Guatemala, mainly around Lake Ati tlan in the west and in the Motagua River, Retalhuleu, and Mazatenango regions as far as Escápula and Rabinal. Also included is a small group near Tapachula, Chiapas. At the present time, the Quicheano group is the largest of the Maya area having 400,000 speakers. It is followed by Yucatan with 300,000 speakers. The other four languages as well as Quiche are found grouped in the Guatemalan highlands in a very densely populated zone and are so closely related that they may be considered direct dialects of the same language. i) The Kekchiano group includes Kekchi, Pokomchi, and Pokoman. In the XVI Century, Kekchi was spoken in a small area of Verapaz near Coban and Cahabon, but since that time has spread considerably to the north and the east taking over part of the territory that formely belong to the Choi group. The Pokomchi subgroup is concentrated in the south of Coban in the region of the headwaters of the Cahabon River. This language so closely resembles Pokoman that sometimes they are both given the name Pokom. In the XVI Century, the two were separated by the incursion into their territory of a group of Pipils from central Mexico. Pokoman was spoken in the XVI Century from the Amatitlan region and Mexico in Guatemala to the vertex formed by the borders of the present Republics of Hondu ras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Since this language has survived in isolation amidst the Nahua speaking zone in southeastern Guatemala in the villages of Chalchuapan, Ahuachapan, San Salvador, and Itztepeque, it is very probable that it was the language of the western part of El Salvador. Although it is no longer spoken in the latter country, it is still current in Guatemala, principally around Antigua and Jalapa. IL</page><page sequence="9">j) Maya itself, comprising the subgroups Yucateco, Lacandon, Itza and Mopan, is spoken in the entire northern area made up of the Peninsula of Yucatan and in the northern part of the central region. At one time, Chontal and Mopan were spoken in the southeastern and southwestern extremes of his region, respectively. Chontal and two branches of Choi were dispersed along the southern border of central region as well as Chorti near Copan; these belong to the Cholano group. Yucatecan Maya, as we already pointed out, is spoken throughout the entire Peninsula of Yucatan. Lacandon is localized in the middle part of the Usumacinta River and towards the west up to the region of the Lacantun, Lacanha, and Jatate Rivers. It seems that this area which had originally been Chole-Lacandon territory was invaded in the XVII Century by a group of Indians from the northern part of the central region who spoke a dialect of Maya itself and who were erroneously called Lacandones. It is very probable that the natives now known by that name who inhabit the jungles of that area today are their descendants. This is one of the least accul turated and hence purest groups and is close to disappearing since there are only about one hundred and eighty individuals left who live scattered throughout this zone. Itza is spoken by a group which came from the eastern part of he Peninsula of Yucatan to found the village of Chichen Itza and later, in the XV Century, settled in the Peten region. At the present time, Itza is spoken in the Peten Lake zone to the northwest of the Mopan group. Mopan is still spoken by several hundred people on the border between Peten and British Honduras. In this classification, the languages listed under a, b, c, d, e, f, and j are found in the lowlands of the Maya area while those under g, h, and i are in the highlands. According to Swadesh, "the great number of variants within the Mayan trunk is due to the fact that the language tended to multiply as a result of geographical separation and the passage of the centuries. He estimates that the linguistic differences that exist today among the Maya languages, Huasteco, Yucateco, Chorti, Chontal, Choi, Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal, Chuj, Ixil, Jacalteco, Pokomchi, Cakchiquel, Mame, Quiche, Pokoman, etc., were produced during the last four thousand years," that is to say, four thousand years ago all of these were at most regional variants of a single language. PHYSICAL TYPE In contrast to a certain heterogeneity in the linguistic situation, the physical appearance of the Maya people is quite homogeneous, mainly in the Peninsula of Yucatan; the same general Maya physical characteristics in varying form may be encountered throughout the entire region they inhabit. For the most part, the Maya is short but stocky with broad shoulders, husky chest, long arms, well-developed legs, small hands and feet. His face is broad, with prominent cheekbones, thick lips, and high forehead. In both sexes, the features are soft and pleasant. Skin tends towards the copperish in color, the eyes are dark brown and hair straight and black, and he has very little body hair. Teeth remain white and free of decay until well into maturity. The Mayas of Yucatan are considered the most brachycephalic people in the world since their cephalic index (the length of the cranium divided by the width) is 85.8 in men and 86.8 in women; in some cases it is as high as 93. No other Maya group is as roundheaded. The ancient Maya tended to accentuate this feature even more through skull deformation. In the highland groups and those of the Chiapas high plateau the skull is a litle narrower, i. e., it tends more towards the dolichocep halic. The epicanthic fold, a completely Asiatic feature, gives their eyes that characte ristic almond shape seen in Mayan paintings and sculpture. In spite of the scanty facial hair of the Maya, representations of individuals with mustaches (in the slave tablet of Palenque) or small pointed or rectangular beards are often found. This feature may be observed in quite a number of anthropo morphic representations in codices, ceramics, and in sculpture itself, as in Stela Β of Copan or the reliefs on the columns of the Castillo in Chichen Itza with the representa tions of the four Bacabs or bearded atlantes which, located at the four corners of the universe, hold up the sky. It is strange that as well as the altantes just mentioned, slaves bearing gods or god-like personages on their shoulders should be represented as having beards or mus taches. It appears that just as they liked accentuating their brachycephaly through</page><page sequence="10">~ *"*'^ "*'&amp;M m^y\ - -: m *&gt;-7-* ?ScWpfV» if - "^|S3 ' ■ i fiw M ■XiMm ' ' ~,*1P 1 .

For this purpose, mothers placed hot cloths on the faces of their sons to keep their beards and mustaches from growing when they reached adulthood. The Maya nose is generally prominent and slightly aquiline. The Mayas also sought to accentuate this feature artificially, particularly in Palenque where this was achieved by means of a singular nasal ornament. The author had the good fortune to participate in the identification of this ornament. This happened three days after the discovery by the archaeologist Alberto Ruz of the sarcophagus in the crypt of the Temple of the Inscriptions in Palenque, when on examining together with Antonio Rodriguez the great slab that covered the altar, he noticed that there was a strange additament on the nose of the profile figure on the stone. He immediately called this to the attention of the discoverer of the tomb of Palenque expressing the opinion that it might represent a superimposed piece. And, as a matter of fact, when the archaelogists subsequently reconstructed the mask that covered the face of the great personage whose skeleton was found inside the sarcophagus, they discovered the arte fact that served this purpose. This nasal ornament which was probably used by personages of the highest rank consisted of an artefact that could be attached to the nose. This now provides us with the explanation of the profile the figure represented on the stucco in Palenque in whom the nose seems to grow straight out of the forehead. All these features, accentuated in the form described, together with strabismus, also artificially produced, make up the canons of beauty which may be observed in all the representations of the classical period, when Mayan art was at its apogee. THE MAYA WORLD AND ITS ORIGINS Are the Mayas indigenous to the American continent? Did they originate in the region they occupied in antiquity? No trace of early man has yet been found within the Maya area. Apart from this, the remains of a man (Tepexpan man) were found in central Mexico who lived approximately 10,000 years ago, but whose physical characteristics according to anthropological investigation have nothing in common with the Mayas. In the main, archaeologists agree that the American continent was populated principally by im migrants from eastern Asia who crossed the Behring Straits fifteen or twenty thousand years ago. Everything seems to indicate that the first settlers arrived in this way in small successive waves which kept pushing each other southwards for thousands of years, thereby populating the continents of the New World. Krickeberg says that no other origin for the original population of America is admissible since it is a branch of the Mongolian or, rather, proto-Mongolian race, whose closest relatives are to be found, according to the North American anthropologist Hrdlicka, among the ancient Asiatics of Siberia and the inhabitants of Mongolia, Tibet, Indochina, Formosa, and the Philippines. Traces of these early immigrants have been found in caves in northwestern Mexico (Coahuila), in Lagoa Santa, Brazil, and Chile whose skeletal remains show them to have been related to the Eskimos of Greenland, the Iroquois, and the ancient inhabi tants of Lagoa Santa, having been long-headed, or dolicocephalic. They must have been followed later alng the same route by later groups of broad-headed, or brachycepha lic, people who were bearers of a more advanced culture than the dolicocephalies and gradually displaced thm. "In some places," says Martinez del Rio, "they probably pushed the long-headed people out and took their place, but it appears that most frequently they mixed, giving rise to the multiple American Indian types of today.. These groups must have brought new technology, new arts, a new religion, and new forms of social organization. However, the descendente of these first settlers may be considered autochtonous up to a certain point inasmuch as they developed the major part of their respective cultures within a geographical isolation that was almost unique in the world having had no known contacts with other peoples. The fact that they imported none of the principal food plants of the Old World shows them to have been still unfamiliar with agriculture. Squash, beans, corn, and the potato are food plants native to Mexico and South America, products of the subsequent independent development of agriculture on the American continent. But, neither should we, on the other hand, think that every thing was invented or reinvented in the New World. It is almost certain that the most recent migrations from Asia introduced cultural elements such as polished stone tools, ✓2?g</page><page sequence="12">the bow and arrow, basketry, and the domestic dog. Some of these elements have been found in northern Mexico in prehistoric sites inhabited by remaining groups of the earliest settlers. As already mentioned, the domestic dog was one of the elements intro duced from Asia, one species of which, for example, corresponds to the tai-tai of Manchuria. Progress in scientific research and the reliability of present-day anthropological studies have led to the rejection as absurd fantasies of those theories according to which man came to America from a legendary Atlantis or the "lost continent of Mu" and together with them, all notions of possible immigrations across the Atlantic. Although these have been discarded for a long time, they continue to serve as the basis for fabulous fiction in certain cheap magazines. The possibility of transpacific contacts subsequent to the first immigrations which we mentioned, however, stands on firmer ground. This theory now has sup porters among the ranks of the most respectable investigators with even the very orthodox admitting the possibility that small groups might have succeeded in reaching the coasts of America in relatively recent times and introduced certain new cul tural features. However, it is very doubtful that any large-scale immigration could have taken place. It should also be pointed out that these theories are still open to question. Fortunately, as anthropology progresses, we learn more and more about the identity, chronology, and relationships of the people who created the great Meso american cultures. Even though much still remains to be done in the field of ar chaeological exploration, it has already been possible to establish five great epochs or cultural horizons in the development of the Indian civilizations of Mesoamerica, including the Maya. The first epoch, which has been called the Formative Hori zon, lasts from 1000 B. C. to the end of the Third Century A. D. Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley, one of the leading historians of the Maya civilization, subdivides the For mative Horizon into three periods. To the first of these, which he calls Pre-Maya I, he assigns a theoretical duration from 3000 to 1000 B. C. THE FORMATIVE PERIOD Since no clues have so far been found, we know nothing about the original occupancy of the Peninsula of Yucatan. However, there are reasons to believe that the first immigrants to come into the peninsula arrived from the south in small groups, probably from Guatemala or Chiapas, about 5,000 years ago. In the Pre-Maya I epoch, the Mayas as yet had no calendar or system for reckoning time. Agriculture was still not practiced and so they knew neither cera mics nor stone architecture. Life in that epoch was maintained exclusively by hunt ing, fishing and collecting in the woods. The people lived in small groups in shel ters made of perishable materials (with palm or straw roofs). According to Mor ley, they were probably linked by a common Maya language and undoubtedly had the same physical features as the present-day Mayas, principally brachycephaly. The second period, or Pre-Maya II runs from 1000 to 353 B. C. and begins with the cultivation of corn in the lowlands of Peten which was probably introduced from the highlands of Guatemala around 1000 B. C. The development of agriculture relieves man of dependence upon hunting and fishing to some degree and he cul tivates additional food plants such as squash, beans, cacao, chilipeppers, etc., well as other inedible but extremely important plants such as tobacco (for ceremoni, purposes), cotton, and the agave from which material was obtained for clothing and fibre for the manufacture of nets, cord, and bags. Parallel with agriculture there appears a primitive type of ceramics called Mamom. The correct measurement of time and more exact calculation of the seasons is initiated in this period with the observation of certain temporal phenomena. The movements of the sun and moon are now considered and, soon afterwards, towards the middle of the IV Century B. C., they knew enough for a Mayan Hipparchus to arise, as Morley says, who invented the calendar and chronological reckoning, one of the great intellectual triumphs of all time. Together with this, hieroglyphics for the calculation of dates make their appearance. It is also in this period that the plastic arts begin to develop and although it is true that stone architecture has not yet appeared, advances were made in cera mics. In the Mamom phase, mentioned above, flat-bottomed plates and vessels in black and cream, red or orange were made. Some vessels and jugs took on a</page><page sequence="13">grooved shape reminiscent of squashes. Anthropomorphic figures with perfo rations for eyes were also created. All this took place in the central region of the Peten, as has been pointed out. In the same period, in the southern part of the Maya area, that is, in the Guatemalan highlands, there appears the equivalent of the Mamom phase which is called Miraflores. Figurines belonging to this period were found in the Kaminal Juyu excavations. These are solid clay hand-molded figurines having obviously oriental features, and covered with a cream-colored slip. They are very similar to the figurines of the Mamom phase of Uaxactun and of certain preclassic types from central Mexico. Decoration is generally incised with parallel, wavy, or crosshatched line motifs or circular and triangular designs. The third and last epoch of the Formative Period is Pre-Maya III, from 353 B. C. to 317 A. D. During this lapse, the Mayas may be imagined as having carried on more intensive activities than in the preceding epoch, realizing their first monuments and sculptures which were undoubtedly made out of the hard woods that abound in the forests of the Peten. This very likely explains why no remains of these monuments have come down to us inasmuch as their survival under the conditions of tremendous heat and dampness of the jungles would have been impossible. The first examples of hieroglyphic writing were probably lost as well for the same reason. The calendar also appears in this period as indicated by the jade plate found in the Tikal region, and now in the Leyden Museum, which bears the earliest known date—320 A. D. Since the plate is inscribed with the only known Mayan chronological characters, this means that the system was already fully de veloped at that time so we may assume that its beginnings lie in an earlier epoch about which we know nothing yet. Maya history actually begins with the date on the Leyden Plate. THE BEGINNINGS OF MAYA HISTORY Although, as we have already pointed out, the main building material of that epoch was wood, the first stone constructions but still without the false Maya arch characteristic of the apogee of this civilization, appear at this time, even in the tombs. Architecture begins to develop in constructions that were at the beginning no more than retaining walls, low terraces, and mounds in the form of platforms. At the end of the period, the people began to build pyramids of masonry of few levels covered with stucco. It is very probable that the beautiful stucco-covered pyramid in Uaxactun, known as E-VII-sub, dates from the end of this period. From the character of its decoration, consisting of feline masks, it belongs, according to Mor ley, more to a proto-Maya than a Maya stage, even though the seeds of the typical Maya tablet may be found here. Vaillant believed, rather, that these masks were Olmec in character, coming perhaps from the La Venta culture. There is no doubt that the latter culture is much older than the Maya (800 or 900 B.C.) which it influenced. The Chicanel ceramics appear in this period whose shapes and decoration, in particular, appear in greater variety than is the case in the preceding epoch. Two colors are generally combined in the vessels: red on orange, red on ochre, black on red, etc. Negative painting and fresco decoration arise at the same time. Vessels and figurines of this period are found in the southern area (Guate malan highlands) which are similar in every way to those of the Chicanel phase of Uaxactun, thereby indicating that the Formative Period in the southern area was contemporaneous with the corresponding period in Peten. The actual history of the Mayas begins after these three stages of the For mative Period. It is divided by Morley into two great epochs which he calls the Old and New Empires. We must point out that this designation has no political connotation at all, but is a term used only in the cultural sense. He divides these, in turn, into three periods each. THE OLD EMPIRE The first period of the Old Empire covers three centuries, from 320 to 633 A.D. In this period, called Old Empire I, which the great historian of the Mayas ac tually dates back earlier (to 317 A.D.), stone architecture comes to the fore with its characteristic feature of the vault with salient or bracketed stone arch, narrowing / /</page><page sequence="14">at it rises from its initial point along both sides of the walls until it can be closed by a single slab. In this period, there appears the Tzakol ceramics of the type called Early Classical Maya, which is basically characterized by polychrome vessels with color combinations of red and black on cream, red and black on orange, black on cream, etc. As far as the shape of this type of ceramics is concerned, tripod or four-legged vessels and plates with a pronounced flange at the base, as well as bowls on pe destal bases and cups with various types of supports in the Teotihuacan style tend to predominate. The decorative motifs are generally geometrical in character but representational designs and celestial glyphs are also found. In the southern area (Guatemala highlands), there appears a type of ceramics similar in every way to that of Peten, or the central area called Old Empire I by Morley and the Initial Series Period by Thompson. Here, as well as in the central part of the Peninsula of Yucatan, which Morley calls the nucleus of the Maya civi lization, vessels are found in association with others that are frankly Teotihuacan in shape, i. e., cylindrical vessels with rectangular tripod supports and shield shaped covers. Thompson maintained from the beginning that the similarities and associations with Teotihuacan were too well-defined to be casual. It has recently been demonstrated, particularly since the excavations at Tikal, that Teotihuacan influence reached the very heart of the Maya area during this epoch as did that of La Venta which, as we have seen, was decisive in the formative stage of the Maya culture. DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF THE MAYA CULTURE Thanks to archaelogical investigation, and it may be said solely because of it, since we have no other types of documents for reconstructing the history of the so called Old Empire we know that Teotihucan influence was greater in the southern than in the central area. The most plentiful and best documented material of this epoch or Initial Series Period comes from Kaminal Juyu, an archaeological site near present-day Guatemala City. As Thompson says, Teotihuacan influences are much more clearly defined than in the central area with a large number of tripod vessels bearing designs quite a bit more similar to Teotihuacan than to Peten styles and with other vessels found in Esperanza tombs which do not appear in Peten but have duplicates in Teotihuacan and in another contemporary horizon of the great Zapotec center of Monte Alban. We have already taken note of the powerful influence exercised by the La Venta culture upon the architectural sculpture of Uaxactun. These early influences must have been taking effect before the third period of the Formative Horizon, that is to say, before 200 B. C. when the La Venta culture as well as the Monte Alban culture were being brought to bear upon the formation of the Maya culture. After that date, when the La Venta culture begins to decline and finally dies, pos sibly towards the beginning of the Christian era, "probably smothered by the very expansion of the Maya culture," as Jimenez Moreno says, the Mayas take the in tellectual lead. It is from that epoch on that cultural influences from the Peten and Chiapa de Corzo reach Monte Alban II and leave their mark even in such regions as remote from the Maya area as Xochicalco and southern Veracruz (region of Los Tuxtlas) ; as Jimenez Moreno described it, after receiving the ball, the Mayas returned it to their maestros in a kind of cultural volley-ball game. A diaspora takes place at the close of the epoch of assimilation of the Maya culture. The Monte Alban, La Venta, and Chiapa de Corzo people, initial bearers of the high cultures, emigrated towards the Maya area when the initi. period of flowering becomes evident there. It is at this time that ti enters its great developmental stage. If not for the Mayas who created a calendrical system of gq hieroglyphic writing, part of which is still undeciphered, we woul able to reconstruct the history of the Old Empire and should hav about the development of the great classical epoch. It was made p by the fact that from the beginning the Mayas adopted the custa commemorative stela every twenty years. In this way, they celebri full time cycle, or one katun, which to be exact was 19 years a Later, they commemorated half katuns, i.e., periods of 10 years (more ex years and 8 months). A stela was even found in Piedras Negras that indicated the</page><page sequence="15">end of a quarter katun or about 5 years. Tlie dates engraved on these stelas have made it possible to follow the evolution of the Maya cities and to trace their pe riods of flowering and decadence with precision. Both the earliest and most recent stelas were found in Uaxactun. The first bears a date corresponding to 328 of the Christian era and the second to 889 A. D. The study of these monuments has enabled us to learn a series of extremely interesting facts about Maya culture, such as, that during the first quarter of Bak tun 9 (435-534 A. D.), the Maya culture spread to its maximum, reaching all points of the Peninsula of Yucatan as well as the higlands of the southern region. It is precisely during this epoch (9.0.0.0.0. 8 Ahau, 435 A. D.) that the documentary history of the northern part of the Peninsula of Yucatan begins. Towards the year 465 A. D., the Maya culture reaches Copan, its southeastern limit. More or less around the same time it extends into the Usumacinta Valley region as well, as has been proved with the decipherment of Stelas 11 and 12 from the place called Altar de Sacrificios located at the confluence of the Rio de la Pasión and the Salinas River. Both stelas were dedicated in 475 A. D. The earliest known monument of Chiapas, discovered in Tonina, was dedicated only one Katun later (9.3.0.0.0.2 Ahau or 945 A. D.). The earliest documents in which Yucatan is mentioned are found in Chronicles No. 1 of Mani and No. 2 of Tizimin, which are the sacred books known under the title of Chilam Balam. These are the books of the prophet priests of Yucatan which contain data that throw light on the history, religion, science and art of the ancient Mayas. These data were originally set down before the introduction of Christianity by priests or "scientists" in books that folded like screens. They were made of strips of bark paper and covered with a thin layer of stucco upon which the hieroglyphic characters were written. Only three of these books escaped destruction at the hands of the Spanish priests in the evangelical zeal of their campaign against idolatry. They were the Codex Tro-Cortesianus or Madrid Manuscript, the Codex Peresianus or Paris Manuscript, and the Codex Dresdensis or Dresden Manuscript. All are in Europe. However, in spite of the fact that many of these books were burned by the early priests other copies, besides the ones mentioned, survived until discovered in the XVII Century. After the Spanish Conquest, the original form or the books was changed and the European style was adopted, with the hieroglyphic giving way to written Latin. Eighteen copies of the books of the Chilam Balam have come down to us, thanks to which we know something about the history of Yucatan. In two chronicles of these books it is related that the Province of Ziyancan Bakhalal, a region which corres ponds to the present zone surrounding Lake Bakalar in the Territory of Quintana Roo, was discovered in 9.0.0.0.0. 8 Ahau or between the years 415 and 435 A. D. These dates coincide with an ancient Maya tradition recorded by Father Lizana around 1619 which says that very few people immigrated into Yucatan from the southeast (Morley calls this migration the Lesser Descent) while many came from the southwest (called by Morley the Great Descent). These groups had probably reached the Okintok region in the northern half of the Peninsula of Yucatan where this early date was discovered. Morley's theory, based on this, is that while the Mayas of the Old Empire were advancing towards the north and northwest from centers in the northwest of Peten (possibly from Xultun, as he says), other groups, possibly from Tikal or Uaxactum or the south central part of Campeche and perhaps even from places as far to the southwest as Palenque, were also introducing the Maya culture into the northwest of Yucatan. This led to the northern centers of the Peninsula of Yucatan being considered subsidiaries of the central region of Peten and of the southern Maya area in general, that is, as outposts, and Yucatan itself as a peripheral region somewhat on the edge of the original frame of Maya civilization. However, the latest archaeological explora tions recently carried out in various sites of Yucatan have been modifying these concepts of Morley which assumed the northern part of the Peninsula of Yucatan to have been more recently occupied than the central Peten region which is what provided the basis for his calling the former the Old Empire and the latter the New Empire.</page><page sequence="16">It was discovered, for instance, that Dzibilchaltun was a center of considerable impor tance from before the beginning of the Christian era to the time of the Conquest without interruption. These new discoveries are very important because, as we shall see in greater detail when we deal with the art and architecture of the Yucatecan centers, they show that the culture of these zones, in spite of sharing common elements with the central and southern regions of Peten, is not derivative but, quite the contrary, is outstanding for its originality of style. THE INTELLECTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE MAYAS It has been said by various authors that when a people learns to write it has passed from the stage of barbarism to that of civilization. The writing of the highly civilized peoples has survived mainly in the form of bas-reliefs in stone or some other lasting material. The ancient Mayas have left us testimony upon a variety of materials of their knowledge of writing —on wood, shell, jade, bone, etc., but mainly in artistic stone bas-reliefs and beautiful books called codices. These books, which were manuscripts, were written on a kind of paper called huun in Maya that was made of the fibres of a tree called copo. The paper was prepared by impregnating the fibres with a vegetable gum and covering them with a very thin layer of stucco agglutinated with starch. These books were not like ours but as was pointed out earlier were made up of leaves that folded like a screen. As far as writing upon more permanent materials is concerned, this appeared in inscriptions painted on temple walls or carved on door jambs, lintels, columns, etc., or on commemorative stelas. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WRITING Writing, in its broadest sense, is that which is drawn, painted, or so concretized that it may be converted into oral expression. In short, anything that may in this way be re-expressed in sounds or words, or, anything represented in this form that gives rise to mental dialogue. The basic purpose of writing is to serve as a vehicle of communication and transmitter of ideas. Among all peoples, writing has passed through three stages of evolution: pictorial, ideographic, and phonetic. Pictorial or figurative writing, in which the image of the idea is represented, was born of the need to imitate that which is visually per ceived. The earliest images naturally do not represent writing but are esthetic expres sion ; neverthelss, it is almost impossible to make a clear separation between the need for expression and the desire to communicate news or knowledge. In the ideographic stage, a step forward is taken in the degree that each word, whether referring to a concrete object or an abstract concept, is represented by a more or less conventional image that we call a sign or character. In Chinese writing, for example, the character or ideogram for the word "prisoner" is the conventional ized representation of a man shut up in a chamber. In phonetic writing, the characters have lost all resemblance to the objects they originally represented and only signify sounds. This is the most advanced stage of writing and one of humanity's most important achievements. Maya writing was fundamentally ideographic, since ideas were represented ra ther than images or sounds, although, it is true that it contained a good number of phonograms and phonetic signs. The fact that it was not completely phonetic like ours did not prevent the Mayas from developing one of the most perfect known chro nological systems and inventing the zero, a keystone of modern science, before the people of the Old World did. The hieroglyphic writing of the Mayas was still in use at the time of the Spanish Conquest of Yucatan which came late (1540-46). Bishop Fray D Landa in his Relaciones de las Cosas de Yucatan, written around 1566 and considered by Morley the Maya "Rosetta Stone," gives us a brief description of tha Maya calendar and of the kind of writing used for representing the different days and months in their chronological system. His main source of information for th^ttgMH</page><page sequence="17">drical dates was an Indian informant named Nachi Cocom, a Maya prince who was versed in hieroglyphic writing, since he belonged to the highest caste of Yucatan. Landa in spite of his prejudices arising from religious zeal and his feeling of repulsion towards the traditions of the Mayas which he considered works of the devil, nevertheless, sought to make a phonetic transcription of the Maya glyphs into the Latin alphabet and to explain their calendar. Thanks to this, those who have devoted themselves to the deciphering of Maya writing have been able to read and interpret about one-third of the hieroglyphics, the majority of which deal with the computing of time. MATHEMATICS AND TIME COMPUTATION Mathematics and astronomy were the sciences in which the Mayas surpassed other peoples of the world. They achieved such an extraordinary degree of advancement in mathematics that they were able to make astronomical calculations of astonishing exactness. The system of counting they used was vigesimal. In our decimal system, we write our numbers horizontally and a number placed immediately to the left of another represents a quantity ten times as large as the first. The Mayas wrote their numbers vertically, one above the other, from bottom to top, the number above representing an amount twenty times that of the number immediately below. Thus, a number was made up of superposed signs equivalent to units which, counting upwards from bottom to top, were designated as being of the first order, second order, etc. In this manner, the unit of the first order is equivalent to 1; of the second order equivalent to 20; of the third order equivalent to 40; and so on. Written numeration up to 19 is represented by dots, each having a value of 1, and bars, each with a value of 5. The number 20, which is of the second order, is represented by a shell (which was the sign for zero) with a dot directly above it; this shows that the sign preceding the dot is not of the first order but of the second, or equal to 20. Shown immediately below is the count in dots and bars up to 19, and the representation of 20 by the shell. 1 . 6 = 10 2 .. 7 3 ' 11 13 • • • • 16 = 16 z= 18 4 —— " 5 .... 9 12 = 15 14 • • • • • • 1? ___ ] g = 20 In order to write the number 17, three bars were written down with two above them: that is, 17 units of the first order with another dot above them indicating a unit of the second order, or 20. In other words, 17 + 20 = 37. Written in Maya numerals, it would look like this. The numbers 21, 22, 23, etc. would be written in the following manner: (two vertical dots) = 21 (one dot over two horizontal dots) = 22 ; # (one dot over three horizontal dots) = 23 (one dot over two bars) = 30 (two dots over three bars) = 36 The number 300 is expressed by placing zero below, thereby indicating the sence of the unit of the first order, with three bars above it; that is by 15 units</page><page sequence="18">of the first order, or, 15 X 20 r 300; the number 17 is then placed above the others in the third position, or, 17 X 20 X 20 = 6,800; all of which adds up to a total of 7,113. The entire operation is shown below. -== 6,800 300 —l-L-L- 13 7,113 Following this same pattern, examples could be given operation with larger numbers, involving units of the fourth and fifth orders, etc. Besides this system of dots and bars, the Mayas had another one in which the numerals were represen ted by glyphs of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic heads. A similar system was used for computing time. As soon as they realized that a strictly vigesimal system of 400 days would give rise to confusion, they changed it in order to be able to use it correctly in their calendar. They divided the solar year of 3641/4 days into groups of 20 days each, as exactly as the vigesimal system permitted. Thereby, the year was divided into 18 "months" of 20 days each. To this total of 360 days, another week of 5 days was added, thus completing a solar year of 365 days. These five days were actually considered as being outside the year and unlucky, a period in which all kinds of bad things might take place. During this extra week, the people avoided all unnecessary work, fasted, and sought to live with moderation. The Mayas based their chronological calculations upon the combined revolu tions of the moon around the earth, and of Venus and the earth around the sun. The Mayan unit of time was not the year, as in our system, but the day or kin, which was the one they used for time computations in their codices and comme morative monuments. In this daily life, however, the Mayas used the year as the time unit just as we do. The time unit that came next, of the second order, was the uninal, or month of 20 days. These were named: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluc, oc, chuen, ch, ix, men, cib, caban, exnab, cauac, ahau. The third degree unit was the tun or year made up of eighteen months or uinals, that is, 365 days. The names of the months were: pop, ou, zip, zotz, tsec, xul, yaxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, kayan and cumbu. The days making up each uninal were numbered from O to 19 much in the same way as we do. For example, the days belonging to the month zip would be written: 0zip, 1 zip, 2 zip, etc., just the same as we would write April 1, April 2, April 3, etc. Besides using units such as the kin and the uninal, the Mayas also divided time into the following periods: The tun, equivalent to 18 uninals, or 360 days. The katun, equivalent to 20 tuns, or 7,200 days. The baktun, equivalent to 20 katuns, or 144,000 days. The piktun, equivalent to 20 baktuns, or 2,880,000 days. The kalablun, equivalent to 20 piktuns, or 57,6000,00 days. The kinchitun, equivalent to 20 kalabtuns, or 1,152,000,000 days. The alautun, equivalent to 20 kinchiltuns, or 23,040,000,000 days. Apart from the solar calendar, the Mayas had a ritual calendar called the Tzolkin which consisted of only 260 days which constituted what we might call the ritual year. This year was consecrated to religious celebrations. We will not go into a description of this calendar because of limitations of space and of the nature of this paper. In summary, the Mayas were surprisingly versatile in their astrono mical activities. They had a lunar calendar in addition to the others mentioned which comprised 405 consecutive lunations divided into sixty groups of six lunations and nine groups of five lunations. "The duration of a lunation was 29 or 30 days. The group of six lunations was calculated sometimes as having 177 days and some</page><page sequence="19">wA m Sri ••J m fHMgk mi fi ■•is ®il » ■ ■ , URNA DE TEAPA/MUSEO DE TABASCO CEREMONIAL URN. TEAPA/MUSEO DE TABASCO</page><page sequence="20">times 178 days, and the group of 5 lunations as having 145 days. The lunations amounted to a total of 11,960 days of 46 tzolkins. The accuracy of Maya calculation is amazing. As a matter of fact, modern astronomers calculate the duration of 405 lunations as 11,959.888 days. The disparity between the calculations of the Mayas and those of today amount to only one day in 300 years." But this is not all. As remarkable as the preceding achievements were, the Mayas went even further and took into account the Venus year. The Codex Dresdensis con tains a Venus-calendar covering a period of 384 years. Says Rivet, "The duration of the revolutions of the planet are repeated in groups of five, each comprising 580, 587, 583, 587 days, which correspond to an average duration of a revolution of 584 days. This varies very slightly from the calculation of modern astronomy which is 583.92 days." All the different signs that represent a day in the three calendars (religious, solar, and Venus) coincided every 104 years, that is, after the passage of two cycles of 52 years each. This extraordinary event was celebrated with exceptional solemnity. THE WORLD OF THE GODS Just as the Mayas reached the heights in mathematics, in religion as well they achieved an abstract concept of divinity like that of the Hebrews themselves. The Mayas worshipped a supreme being, creator of the universe, whose name was Hunab or Hunab Ku, "the incorporeal God. the all-highest, the one and only." His name. Hunab, means: alone; "He who is of himself"; "He who does not represent himself"; and God. Basically, this is the religious concept of the Mayas of the Old Empire. It is a great pity that when the Spaniards arrived, the Maya religion should have already suffered change through previous successive conquests by foreign peoples who intro duced idolatrous rites and human sacrifice, to the point where the Spanish priests thought that this was an utterly idolatrous people. The Mayas believed in the existence of a series of worlds, all of which were de stroyed in succession by a great flood. Landa, who recorded this tradition tells us that "Among the throng of gods worshipped by these people, they worshipped four, each of whom was named Bacab. These, they say, were four brothers whom God (Hunab Ku) put there when he created the world and added to the four parts of himself to hold up the sky so that it did not fall. They likewise say of these bacabs that they escaped when the world was destroyed by the flood." They also possessed secondary gods who probably had their origin in a primitive agricultural stage and who were on a more familiar footing with the people, being intimately related to the affairs of daily life. These gods were either malevolent or beneficent; the latter produced the rain and favored the corn crop, thereby avoiding starvation, and were the gods of the thunder and lightning, while the former caused drought, storms, hurricanes, and war. This religious dualism that existed among the Mayas of Yucatan, was also cha racteristic of the central and southern Maya area, that is, in the Peten and Guatemalan highlands. Good and evil, the two forces in perpetual struggle in nature as well as in man, naturally had their representative deities among the Yucatan Mayas as well as those of Guatemala. These happen to be the only surviving gods of the Maya pantheon, since the most complex and abstruse religious concepts and the more spe cialized gods of the great classical epoch had to disappear together with the last Maya priests when the Spanish Conquest reached them. Belief in these primitive gods per sists to this day among the people of that region and the Lacandones of the jungle of Chiapas and the Indians of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, where the malevolent spirit already mentioned is called Mam. This supernatural being is the cause of misfortune and adversities and responsible for storms and floods, volcanic eruptions that destroy very thing, earthquakes, clouds of locusts, pestilences, and starvation. Opposed to is god iA-jWqt'1 enamed Tzultacd who is characterized by benevolence and his dis ltion a^jg3\knes to remedy evils and whose moods are always kind and affable. Here winrwFwrliow geographical environment shapes religious concepts. The main features j){ tl®northern part of the Peninsula of Yucatan are lack of rain and arid • -oil While in the northern area there is jungle vegetation, torrential rains ) il'ihg^lind a chain of volcanoes shake the earth. The ijhalev^ij Snt god is represented as a hunchbacked old man with countless wrinkle?; (which probably denotes that evil is as old as humanity itself), fangs in</page><page sequence="21">stead of teeth, popeyes, and prominent cheekbones. The good god, on the other hand, was young, handsome, and erect, with well-proportioned mouth and features and thick hair. "Tzultacd lived in the caves and Mam in the bowels of the earth. To this day, the Keckchis attribute the rumbling of the earth to Mam; when they hear the subterranean sounds they exclaim, "Guanbi li Mam (listen to Mam)." This struggle between good and evil is represented in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus, in which Chac, the rain-god may be seen protecting a young tree with Ah Puch, the God of Death, approaching him from behind to destroy what he has created. As already mentioned, the creator of the world is Hunab Ku. This god had created Maya humanity out of corn. Outside of this concept, this god was too elevated and abstract to have played an important role in the life of the people. His son, Itzamna, however, was of a more tangible character, having been the lord of the sky, day and night, who gave the Mayas writing and the codices or holy books and possibly the calendar and was the first to name the places in Yucatan and to distribute the land among men. Says Morley, "These activities, by their very nature indicate that the cult of Itzamna did not originate in Yucatan, which is the region of the New Empire, but was brought thither from somewhere else; and since we know that the priesthood and hieroglyphic writing first developed in the Old Empire, it is obvious that he must have been a deity who was transplanted from the Old Empire to the New. . He was specially invoked during the propitiatory ceremonies of the New Year to avert misfortunes or calamities. His worship was associated with that of the sun-god Kinich Ahau. It seems that Itzamna was only a single god with different manifes tations, since in the month Uo, a ceremony is held in his honor as the manifestation of the sun-god. During this ceremony the priests consulted the sacred books to predict the events of the coming year. In the month of Zip he was invoked as the god of medicine and in the month of Mac he was worshipped by the old men in a special ceremony together with the Chaques or Chacob. Itzama is characterized by being a benevolent deity and friend of man. The most important deity in the Maya pantheon after Itzamna was Chac. He was the God or Rain and played a role of primary importance in Yucatan for the reasons already mentioned. He is generally represented in both painting and sculpture with a long proboscis-like nose, the shape of which was probably derived from the snout of the tapir which lives in the tropical jungles of the Peten and in the Usuma cinta region. To this day, the Lacandones associate this animal with the rain and storms. In ancient times it was associated with Kukulkan, the god of the wind. The relation of the tapir with this deity can also be seen in the fact that for the Lacan dones, when this animal bursts upon the scene in the wake of a windstorm, trampling their cornpatches, they are sure that a storm with plenty of rain is on the way. Like Itzamna, the rain god is a benevolent deity who protects agriculture and life and is therefore associated with creation. The third god in the hierarchy is the God of Corn or agriculture who is repre sented with the features of a youth sometimes wearing an ear of corn as a headdress and sometimes a shoot of the same plant. His specific name as the God of Corn is unknown but he has been identified with Yum Kaax. Like Itzamna and Chac, the God of Corn was a benevolent deity, protector of life and dispenser of riches and abundance. He is frequently designated by the letter "E." The God of Death is the next god in the sequence. His name is Ah Puch and he occurs 88 times in the three known codices. He is represented with a skull as a head and has a series of bells all over his body which is made up of bare ribs and spinal processes. The rest of his body is marked with black or purplish circles that suggest decomposition. We have been informed by the Guatemalan linguist, Otto Shu mann, that certain survivals of the death cult still exist in the Lake Peten Itza region. The author, for his part, believes he has discovered a singular modern cult of an Indian San Pascual in various parts of Chiapas which is obviously related to tl pre-Hispanic cult of Ah Puch. The "saint" in question is no more than a skeleti carved out of wood having more or less the same charasteristics as have been scribed for Ah Puch, which the Indians keep in a coffin that rests on a small ca We believe that the creaking of the wheels of the cart produces a sound eq valent to that of the bells of Ah Puch, for the Indians say that when a person hears the creaking of "San PagcuaJ's" cart at midnight, he will soon die. Like the ancient</page><page sequence="22">Maya gods who functioned according to the pattern of religious dualism of which we spoke, this image is able to cure a sick person as well as bring about another's death. "Even today, es Yum Cimil, the Lord of Death, the modern Maya believes he prowls around the houses of the sick, looking for prospective prey," says Morley. As a malevolent deity, Ah Puch is linked with Ek Chuah, the God of War and human sacrifice. The dog, the Moan bird, and the owl, considered to be animals associated with death or evil omen, are his constant companions. The fifth deity of the Maya pantheon, Xaman Ek, the God of the North Star, was considered the guide of travelers and merchants. He is always represented by a snub nose and certain peculiar black marks on his head. His name glyph represents a kind of monkey head. Like the Greeks and Romans whose custom it was to set up altars along the principal roads dedicated to Hermes or Mercury, god of the travelers and merchants, the ancient Maya merchants also set up altars to Xaman Ek along the roads at which they offered pom, or sacred incense, to be guided and protected on their travels. The sixth divinity was Ek Chuah, the God of War. He is represented in the Maya codices almost as many times as the God of Death. In keeping with their religious dualism, the Mayas assigned a double nature to this god which in a certain way is contradictory. On the one hand, as God of War he was a malevolent deity, while on the other, as God of Traveling Merchants, he was benevolent. In the illus tration of the destruction of the world in the Codex Dresdensis, he is shown next to the goddess Ixchel, armed with two lances taking part in the destruction of the world by flood. Sometimes he is seen in his benevolent aspect decked out as a traveling merchant or carrying the head of Xaman Ek, the guide of the merchants. As God of Trade, he was the patron of cacao, the seeds of which were used as money by the Indians from pre-Hispanic times until relatively recently. This god is generally shown painted black, the color of war. His name glyph is an eye ringed with black. The Siva or Kala of the Mayas is the God of War, human sacrifice and violent death. He is God F. Like the latter of those two Hindu gods, his activity is exclusively that of destruction. He is almost always represented with a black line partly circling his eye and extending down to his cheek. His name glyph is his own head with a number 11 in front of it. As the god of destruction, he is represented sometimes as setting fire to houses with a torch in one hand while he finishes destroying them with the lance he carries in the other hand. The next in the hierarchy of gods is the God of the Wind or God K, who is associated by some with Kukulkan, the well-known Maya-Mexican culture hero. How ever, as Morley says, this association is not very clear. His relation to Chac, the rain god is unquestionable. In the Codex Peresianus, Chac may be seen presenting the head of the wind-god to the young corn-god at a ceremony celebrating the end of a katun or 20-year period. The wind-god, or at least his head appears here again with its characteristic foliated proboscis which, as we pointed out, was possibly inspired by that of the tapir of the tropical jungles of Chiapas or the Peten, which the Lacan dones consider to be the messenger of the rain. The goddess Ixchel, consort of Itzamna, Lord of the Heavens, had two contrary activities: destruction and creation. The two are conciliated, however, since within the Maya dualism, life is eternal and matter transitory, every act of creation supposes a previous destruction. In her character as destructive goddess, she was the personifi cation of storms and floods and may be seen in this guise in the Codex Dresdensis where she appears as an irate old woman destroying the world by flood. She is usually represented as an old woman wearing a headdress of a coiled serpent and surrounded by symbols of death and destruction. At the same time, as goddess of childbirth and inventor of weaving, she is considered a benevolent deity since she protects women in labor and weavers. It is possible that as wife of Itzamná, she may have been the Goddess of the Moon. All these gods were worshipped and a very complex ritual was observed with the greatest strictness. In order for one to participate in the religious ceremonies, it was necessary for him to go through a period of prolonged fasting and abstinence beforehand and when required by the occasion he bled himself and scourged his body. Although sacrifices were the predominant aspect of these ceremonies, they were blood less during the Old Empire. These were limited to offerings animals, foods, precious</page><page sequence="23">objects or papers impregnated with blood that had been drawn by puncture in various parts of the body. It was not until afterwards, towards the end of the classical epoch, that human sacrifice with large numbers of victims appears in the northern part of the Peninsula of Yucatan together with the arrival of a group of warriors from the Mexican high plateau led by Kukulcan, a warrior chieftain who introduced a new cult and new customs. GENERAL SUMMARY OF MAYA HISTORY It would be convenient to present a brief synopsis of the course of the develop ment of Maya civilization before going on to a description of some of their great ceremonial centers. Since we have already seen the Formative Period and part of the Classical Period or so-called Old Empire, we will start here with the second phase of the latter. It has been described how architecture takes on the feature of the false arch in the Early Classical Period or First Period of the Old Empire which Morley dates bet ween 317 and 633 A. D. and Thompson between 325 and 625 A. D. It is in this period that their typical architecture begins to develop and they start to erect their calen drical stelas. At the same time, Maya art frees itself from the archaic features of the Formative Period and develops the Tzakol pottery, now more highly developed and richer in shapes and decoration. In the beginning, between 337 and 435 A. D., the Maya civilization was practically confined within a very small radius around Tikal and Uaxactun with some other centers like Balakbal and Uolantun. After this last date, however, Maya expansion proceeded at a fast rate and very soon they began to erect monuments in Tonina, Yadchilan, Palenque, Naachtun, Kalakmul, Xultun, Altar de Sacrificios y Oxkintok. This expansion was mainly westward towards Pa lenque and Tonina, but it also reached the northwestern part of the Peninsula of Yucatan. It is in this epoch (435 A. D.) that the Itzas discover Chichen Itza and occupy it around (514 A. D.) Southwards, the expansion reaches Copan. According to Morley, the Second Period of the Old Empire (633 to 731 A. D.), or the Flowering of the Classical Period (625 to 800 A. D.) according to Thompson, is represented by great developments in the lowlands of the Maya area in sculpture, architecture, and hieroglyphic writing. The finest pottery, mold-made figurines of extraordinary finish, and the best gem work are produced in this period and great progress is made in astronomy and mathematics. New ceremonial centers are estab lished indicating a slight advance towards the west and north. Around the end of this period (692 A. D.), Chichen Itza is abandoned by the Itzas who settles themselves in Chakanputun on the banks of the Champoton River. In spite of this, the expansion of Maya culture reached its peak during this period and in addition to the numerous centers set up, nineteen commemorative monuments with hiero glyphics were erected. The Third Period is characterized by a great epoch of flowering followed by almost total collapse. Three great new ceremonial centers were established in the Peten and Chiapas region between 731 and 790 A. D.: Nakun, Bonampak, which means "City of the Painted Walls" (now considered first class), and Seibal, as well as many other secondary centers in an expansion to the four points of the compass. The year 790 A. D. marks the limit of the expansion of the so-called Old Empire. The epoch of collapse or decadence is between 800 and 925 A. D. During time the great ceremonial centers were abandoned one by one possibly because rebellion of the masses against the ever increasing oppression of the theocracy, wr the growth in the population. Also linked with this may have been the exhaustion of the soil by the "milpa" system in which there is no crop rotation, and perhaps the increase in all types of tribute and personal sacrifice demanded of the popular masses. Or, perhaps, as Thompson says, it was due to a chain reaction against the tremendous pressure from the center of Mexico. In this period, Mexican influence broke through the western part of the Peninsula of Yucatan and succeeded in afect ing some Puuc cities, some of which were abandoned. An interregnum follows this period in which the great ceremonial centers remain without leaders and the central area returns to a cultural level similar to that of</page><page sequence="24">the Formative Period. The Indians go back to their villages near their fields and make occasional visits to the abandoned ceremonial centers to carry out their rituals and bury their less important personages. This takes place between the years 925 and 975 A. D. Plumbate pottery and metal ornaments are introduced into Yucatan in this period. During the "Mexican" Period (975 to 1200 A. D.), the Itzas, who had estab lished themselves formerly in Chakanputun (southwestern region of the present State of Campeche), on abandoning Chichen, settle once more in Chichen Itza in the year 987 A. D., but this time they come back led by Kukulkan and his foreign followers who speak the Mexican language. At the time they re-establish themselves in Chichen Itzá, the cult of Quetzalcoatl or the Plumed Serpent is introduced as well as that of other gods from the Mexican high plateau and along with this human sacrifice and holy warfare to obtain victims for the sun-god. The theocratic government comes to an end and is succeeded by one directed by warriors. Art and architecture, although spectacular, lose their refinement but continue to possess a certain barbaric grandeur. The characteristic features of the art of this period are the use of turquoise, precious metals, plumbate pottery with metallic glaze, and the constant plumed serpent motif. The fall of Chichen Itza comes at the close of this period. In the same year that the Itzas established themselves in Chichen Itza, Kukulkan founded the village of Mayapan at the head of which he placed a family by the name of Cocom. Later, in 1007 A. D., Uxmal was founded by a chief named Zuitok Tutul Xiu from the southeast who was undoubtedly of the same Toltec origin as Kukulkan or Quetzalcoatl. In spite of having brought many stylistic features of Tula to Yucatan, these two great chiefs were unable to introduce their language perhaps because of their previous long stay in the Chakanputun region in contact with the Itzas. The chiefs of the three great centers, Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Mayapan, formed what was called the Mayapan League between the years 987 and 1007 A. D. The ceremonial centers were converted into true cities during this epoch. The years 1200 to 1540 were an epoch of absorption of Mexican elements. The complete secularization of the culture was carried out in this period. In the style of the center of Mexico, the city of Mayapan was converted into the capital of a Yuca tecan "empire." A frankly centralist and tyrannical government then arises. The leading groups gradually abandon their "Mexican" culture except for warlike customs, and little by little assimilate the language and religion of the Mayas. There is a brief renaissance of the Maya culture in this period due to their con tact with foreigners, and it is that some of the admirable monuments of Chichen Itza and Uxmal are constructed as well as the new centers of Kabah, Labna, Sayil, and Izamal. Towards the end of the Tenth Century internecine warfare breaks out between Chichen and Mayapan because of political and economic rivalry between the two regions and the Itzas are finally expelled from Chichen Itza (1194 A. D.). This puts and end to the resurgence that was taking place. A very similar situation occurs in the highlands of Guatemala where the Quiches, like the Cocom of Mayapan, establish an "empire" over the other groups in which certain vestiges of Mexican influence may be seen that are, however, permeated with strong regional feelings. Subsequently, in 1441 A. D., the Mayapan tyranny becomes so intolerable that a series of rebellions take place against the tyrants of that place. Mayapan was sacred and the chief assassinated, at the same time that the Itza leaders held captive by the Mayapan people were set free. These returned to their respective regions where they proceded to establish little "chiefdoms." With the breakup of the tyrannies, in both Mayapan and Quiche, all authority disappeared and political disorganization was complete. The establishment of the small independent "chiefdoms" gave rise to other rivalries and multiple internecine wars which accomplished nothing but the precipitation of decadence. At least one hundred years before the Spaniards invaded the country, the splendor of the Maya civilization had given way to a state of chaos and decadence in which the great traditions were already forgotten. Political weakness, lack of guiding principles, and cultural decadence made the great Maya area fall easy prey to the Conquest between the years 1535 and 1541. The last group, that of the Itzas, who had occupied the northern part of Yucatan since remote times, remained withdrawn and independent, hidden and almost forgotten in the remote city of Tayasal in the jungles of the Peten, until it was also discovered and conquered at the late date of 1697.</page><page sequence="25">THE CITIES THE SACRED MOUNTAIN AND THE GENESIS OF MAYA ARCHITECTURE "The Zipacna was the god of the moun tains and he made them in a single night." Ordonez y Aguiar, "Historia de la creacion del cielo y de la tierra." From its very beginnings Maya architecture was linked with religion, and it may be said that the idea of its existence goes back to the most remote mythological times. In that distant and nebulous age, when history merges with myth, the sacred mountains must have been the pyramids, built first as the cosmogonic myths say, by the divine breath of supernatural beings who put them up in a single night, and then by men. These were the first work of architecture. The evolution of Maya religious architecture is intimately linked with the concept of the mountain-temple. The geometrical synthesis of the form of the pyramid replaces the natural reality and at the top of it is placed the temple from which, closer to the heavens, man may make his prayers to God. Undoubtedly, the first pyramids were completely primitive and basic, simple mounds, resembling a remote and perhaps mythological sacred mountain raised to the gods in testimony of man's desire to approach them. As time went by, there would have been an increasing number of them which became more and more complicated in form and then part of a compound until they finally ended up by being a complicated system of superpositions, sub structures, and terraces, slopes, panels, stairways, etc. Then came superstructures or sanctuaries, as such, with chambers and galleries which were undoubtedly inspired in the Mayan hut, whose form and perishable materials were later translated into stone. Yet, underlying all the architectural complexity of the compounds of the cere monial centers are simple and naturalistic forms; the primordial symbols and the central concept of architectural genesis. Mention is made in the Colonial chronicles of these artificially built primitive pyramids or mounds. Cogolludo tells us in reference to the Indians of Yucatan, that, "before going forth to fish... the Indians brought offerings and made sacrifices on some heights that dominate seas and lakes along the entire coast which they call Kues or temples..." It is very probable, as Enrique Juan Palacios has shown, that the origin of the name of the inhabitants of the region we call the Huasteca is not huasteca as was thought, but cuexteca, - that is, the inhabitants of the country of the Cues, which means temples, since this fertile and interesting region is crowded with them, as remarked by the previously mentioned author. It should not be forgotten the Huasteco is a Mayoid zone which was separated possibly in an epoch much before the Christian era from the rest of the Maya area probably by the intrusion of foreign peoples, possibly Totonacs or Zoques, as Jimenez Moreno thinks, who drove a wedge into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, separating it from the Mayas. Now, it appears that the kues of the Huastecos are the prototype of the pyramids subsequently built by the peoples of the Classical Period. All of this seems to indicate that the kues of the Huastecos are symbols of the sacred mountain and prototypes of the pyramidal bases constructed in the Classical Epoch. "Many of the Huastecan mounds," according to Enrique Juan Palacios, "are not pyramidal but circular in plan, having been made in layers and with superposition of materials, but do not lack the sections and terraces of proper pyramids." THE MOST ANCIENT REMAINS. As has just been seen, the oldest examples of Maya architecture the mounds described by Cogolludo or the Huastecan kues which plan like the Preclassical pyramid of Cuicuilco, one of the oldest of ti Mexico. In the Maya area, however, the earliest example of stone architec is the pyramid E-VII-sub of Uaxactun, Guatemala, which was recovered stucco and wonderfully preserved because shortly after having been built, i covered by another pyramid which protected and preserved it for us practicall it was when constructed.</page><page sequence="26">The Maya hut, as pointed out before, is the model for the temple we see on the substructures with the pyramidal bases. It has been suggested that this same Maya hut with its peaked thatched roof having two or four slopes, was the prototype of the Mayan false arch. This seems to be a very plausible theory, since when one compares the inside of the hut with that of the temple, the similarity is so obvious that it immediately suggests that the inside slopes of he roof of the hut could have given rise to the Maya false arch which repeats like an echo the same slope of planes. According to archaeological research, the earliest examples of vaults in the Maya area begin to make their appearance together with the erection of the stelas. The first of these may have been built as early as the year 278 A. D. The first exam ples of vaults are still very rough, made of irregular undressed slabs laid on a bed of heavy mortar and small stones. In this first period, the slopes or con cave faces of the arches are covered with a thick layer of rough material to hide the irregularities. However, when the Maya civilization reached Palenque during its peak, be tween the Seventh and Tenth Centuries, the art of architecture had reached its lof tiest expressions, aesthetically as well as technically. It had progressed to the point where a style arose that went in for daring architectural and sculptural forms. Not only were trilobate vaults built which sometimes approach the spirituality of line of the Gothic ogive, but even went as far as to build vaults with various profiles, some stepped, other curved or in the form of a pointed arch, and still others with capri cious bottle-like forms. The primitive temple was perhaps square in plan at the beginning but became rectangular, then divided and multiplied, grew, filled out with galleries, and became converted into a palace for the gods. THE PRODIGIOUS CITIES OF THE GODS "Votan. .. the Lord of the Hollow Stick. .. who was the first sent by God to divide and distribute the land. .. gave each village its own tongue... in Huehuetan he placed a great treasure in a dark house that he breath ed into existence with his breath..." His tory of the Creation of Heaven and Earth. The concept of architecture and town planning goes back to mythological times. Architecture and all the arts in general are considered to have originated as activities of the gods themselves. To the Maya, there is something magical and marvelous in creative activity. Just as in the case of our own bible, the first chapter we come upon when we open the sacred book of the Mayas, the Popol Vuh, is that of Genesis: the history of the creation of heaven, the earth, and man. In that far-distant stage of creation we already find the gods in the roles of creators, architects, and builders, of surveyors and cosmographers: "This book is the first book, painted long ago, but its visage is hidden (today) to him who looks at it, to the thinker. Great was the exposition, the history of when the measuring was finished of all the angles of the heavens, of the earth, the quadrangulation, its measurement, the measurement of the lines in the sky, in the earth, of the four angles, in the four corners, as had been said by the Builders, the Shapers..." The Mayas believed that universe had thirteen heavens arranged in layers, the lowest of which was the earth. Presiding over each of these layers or levels was one of the thirteen gods of the upper world, who were called Oxlahuntiku, which means "thirteen gods." The nether world was made up of nine infra-worlds also arranged in layers in the same way as the upper world. The gods of the nether world were called Bolontiku or Nine Lords of the Night. Ah Puch, the Lord of Death, lived in the bottommost layer of the nether world. The majority of Maya gods are repres ented in groups of four, each corresponding to one of the cardinal points and each with his distinctive color. We find manifested in everything the mathematical mental ity and the orderly and geometrical sense of these people which, furthermore, was combined with a poetic feeling that we find in the story of the cardinal points as told in the book of Chilam Balara de Chumayel: the gourd tree spreads over the earth of the east. Its gourd is the red rose. The flower incarnadine is its bloom. i3</page><page sequence="27">"The white gourd tree inundates the earth of the north. .Its gourd is the white rose. The white flower is its hloom. "The black gourd tree spreads over the earth of the south. Its gourd is the yellow lily. The yellow flower is its bloom." When the creation of the earth had terminated, the Maya "bible" says, "... all was concluded to perfection, divided into parallels and climes: all in order, all well measured in squares." The Mayas of today believe that three worlds besides the present one have existed since the creation. The first of these three worlds, in contrast to the version of Mexican mythology in which the first inhabitants of the world were giants, ac cording to the Mayas they were dwarves called saiyam uinicob or "the builders or formers." It was believed that these built the great ceremonial centers the ruins of which have been discovered. As Thompson tells us, this work was carried out in the darkness, since the sun had not yet been created, and as soon as it did appear, the dwarves turned to stone and their images may still be seen in the ruined cities, the figures in Chichen Itza called atlantes perhaps being representations of them. This belief that strange men erected the great architectural monuments, now in ruins, in a marvelous manner extends as far as the Zoque region. These are close neighbors of the Mayas. About twelve or fifteen years ago, when the author was making an archaeological study of the colonial temples of the XVI Century in the almost inaccesible region of the Zoques to the north of the State of Chiapas, while examining a ruined temple in Osluacan, a woman of the village approached and told him that all these great temples in ruins together with one in an abandoned place which the inhabitants of the same village calls the "Old Village," had been e rected during the night by red men. Curiously enough, the atlantes of which Thompson speaks which are clearly visible now holding up an altar in the Temple of the War riors in Chichen Itza, have their counterpart in others belonging to the Olmec or La Venta culture and which form part of an altar called "Monument 2" in Potrero Nuevo, Veracruz. These atlantes, more than those in Chichen, are indeed dwarves. We know that a special cult to these beings existed in the Olmec or La Venta culture. (See: Stirling, "Stone Monuments of the Rio Chiquito, Veracruz, Mexico. "Anthropological Papers, Wash., 1955). The Maya tradition that the great monu ments now in ruins were erected by dwarves in the night may be interpreted to mean that the night represents the pre-Maya epoch, when the history of this people had not yet begun, and the bearers of the great civilization were the Olmecs of the La Venta culture? We do not know, but this seems to us like a plausible hypothesis. THE MAYA CITIES What were Maya cities like? How were they organized? The first question is answered in the beginning of this article in which it was said that they were actually religious ceremonial centers and that the people, of whom the vast majority were farmers, lived on their fringes. But let us listen to what Landa tells us, who was able to record information that was still fresh about how the Mayas lived in those cities. ".. .The natives lived together in towns in very civilized fashion, and had their land well created and free of weeds and with very good trees planted; and their dwelling place was as follows: in the center of the town were the temples with handsome squares and around the temples stood the houses of the lords and of the priests, and then of the more important persons, and so, the richest and most rsepected persons lived closer to them while the houses of the lower class were located at the ends of the village. The wells, when they were few, were close to the houses of the lords and they had their improved lands planted with wine trees and with cotton, pepper, and corn..." These settlements were true cities in the modern sense of the world, the only difference being that the houses were not lined up by streets and avenues but spread about in large contiguous sectors. The main structures, such as, the temples, palaces, pyramids, monasteries, observatories, ball game courts, and platforms for the pre sentation of sacred plays or dances were generally laid out around large squares or courtyards where the religious and administrative affairs of the population were taken up. Some of these cities, Uxmal or Chichen Itza, for example, had as many as 200,000 inhabitants.</page><page sequence="28">PALENQUE. Lapida de los esclavos.

The location of its buildings, distributed on levels upon a mountain slope (the Don Juan) overlooking the vast green sea of the infinite plain that loses itself in the horizon, from which they barely emerge like fine pieces of oriental ivory from the dark green tropical foliage. In this it resembles Angkor Wat in Cambodia and in the fact that sculpture reached its highest level there, also. It is here that the artistic genius of the Maya burgeons, producing sculpture which because of having been modeled in the ductile material that is stucco it took on an expression that continues to glow with life that seems to palpate with the very jungle. Here, engraving in stone was also done using a calcareous material that was as hard and fine as a lithograph stone which they worked with a delicacy and mastery like that of the ancient chínese engravings. Some of the most outstanding bas-reliefs, engraving, and stuccos, on panels and slabs which may still be seen in situ today are distributed among various tem ples making up the grandiose ensemble of this city. The central part of this great unit is occupied by a great structure, such as the building group, courtyards, porticos, tower and inner galleries, constructed upon a platform more than ten meters high in which the so-called "undergrounds" are. This vast ensemble which covers a total area of 80 by 100 meters is called the Palace. Its platform has stepped sections some of which have panels decorated with high re liefs in stucco. To the north of this great ensemble is the so-called Count's Temple which to gether with five other small temples makes up what has been named the North Group. There is still another temple to the west, still unexplored. To the south and southeast, very close to the Palace is the Temple of Inscriptions. To the southeast there is a square of considerable size surrounded by various temples; on the north east by the Temple of the Cross, on the southeast by the Temple of the Foliated Cross, and on the southwest by the Temple of the Sun. Other temples besides these, never explored, may be seen, such as, the famous temple called the House of the Lion, also known as the Temple of the Beautiful Relief because of the figure appear ing on its panel, copied by the artist Waldeck over a century ago, which pro voked the admiration of Europe. The only thing left of this figure today is the throne of the jaguars of which only the paws may be seen. There are still others besides these buried under a thick layer of jungle. The great archaeologist and tireless explorer Frans Blom (whose recent death was a great loss to Mexican archaeology) discovered many other groups of build ings throughout the entire zone of Palenque whose total area he calculated at sixteen square kilometers. The most spectacular of the temples of Palenque from every point of view in respect to size as well as location is, without doubt, the Temple of Inscriptions. It was there that a great tomb was found inside a pyramid. A sarcophagus cover ed by a great stone slab contained the remains of an important person literally covered with jade jewelry together with offerings among which several pearls were found, including a pear-shaped one of extraordinary size. The artistic treasures encountered inside this funerary chamber are of great importance: the walls of the crypt, sumptuosly decorated with stucco reliefs represent ing the Bolontiku or nine Lords of the Night; the magnificent sculptured altar consisting of a great monolithic slab 3.80 by 2.20 meters by 25 centimeters thick mounted on a base also made of a single block of stone, a piece that has no equal among the other known Mayan altars; and the extraordinary human heads modeled out of stucco. According to the opinion of the archaeologist Ruz, the dedication date of this admirable stone, based in the most recently accepted correlation system, coincides with January 27, 633 A.D. Everything seems to point to this marvelous crypt, called the "Secret Chamber" by the archaeologists, as having been built before the pyramid. This is based on the hypothesis that since the base and heavy altar slab could not have passed through the narrow stairways and corridors leading to the cypt, it was the motive for the building of the pyramid. a</page><page sequence="30">This sensational discovery by Alberto Ruz Lhuillier, one of Mexico's outstand ing figures in the field of Mayan archaeology, has completely revolutionized the old concept that the pyramids of Mexico and Central America, in contrast to those of Egypt, were not used as tombs but only as bases for temples. NEW EMPIRE CITIES Although generally considered a New Empire city, Chichen Itza, Mecca of the Mayas of the north of the Peninsula of Yucatan, also belonged to the Old Empire or Classical Period with which it was contemporaneous. It was founded by the Itzas, the "holy men", in the Sixth Century, abandoned by them in 692 A.D., and subsequently reoccupied by the same group in 987 A.D., except this time under the leadership of chiefs from central Mexico. During this period, the great city went through a period of flowering that lasted for three cen turies, from the Xlth to the XHIth. It then fell under the hegemony of Mayapan, and the Itzas were expelled in 1194. The Mayapan "empire" collapsed afterwards in the year 1441. The Itzas no longer remained in Chichen Itza but emigrated to Tayasal. They were the only Maya group that resisted the Spanish invasion until finally they were subjugated in 1697. Chichen Itza, which means "mouth of the well of the Itzas," covers three kilo meters from north to south and two kilometers from east to west. Hundreds of ruined structures bear testimony to the importance of this great center during the time it flourished. Of all these, only a score may be seen. The rest are still covered by the jungle, which although low, hides them completely. The buildings making up the city of Chichen Itza belong to two periods. The first covers those finished between the Sixth and Tenth Centuries of the Christian era, which we may call the Maya period. The second includes those built between the Eleventh and Fourteenth centuries which may be designated as the Maya-Mexi can period. The building of the first period are in the southern part of the city: Akab D'Zib, the Nunnery, the Red House or Chichán-Chob, which means "little holes", the House of the Deer, etc. The second period produced the following buildings: the Castle, the Ball Game, The Temple of the Warriors, the Charnel House, the Tzompantli, the Temple of the Eagles, the Temple of Venus, and a short distance from this group, the astronomical observatory called the Snail Shell, and the Temple of the Three Lintels. All these buildings exhibit a marked Mexican, or rather Tol tec, influence as a result of invasions from central Mexico. The most characteristi cally Toltec building is undoubtedly the Snail Shell which is built like the circular Toltec structures dedicated to the god Ehcatl-Quetzalcoatl. The Castle, consequently, with its nine stepped sections and vertical panels and stairways with serpent heads where the beams are set in, has an almost exact counterpart, although on a smaller scale, in another Toltec pyramid in Queretaro, in the center of Mexico. The base of the Castle is topped by a temple with serpent columns at the main entrance and has an interior temple where the famous sculpture known as the Red Tiger is. A whole series of stylistic features reveal the strong Toltec influence in Chichen Itza: The flat roofs resting on columns decorated with warriors in almost flat bas relief ; the hypostyle; the panels decorated with the typically Toltec motif of eagles and tigers; the supports in the form of atlantes; the altars of skulls; the chacmols lying in the courtyards or vestibules of the temples; the mural paintings or themes of war and human sacrifice, etc. All these elements made their appearance in Chi chen Itza towards the XI Century, gradually modifying the structures of Old Chichen through additions and superpositions until this metropolis took on a central Mexican appearance. Uxmal, another of the great centers of the so-called New Empire, to the south west of Chichen, was founded in the X Century by the Xiu, one of the Maya-Mex ican groups that invaded Yucatan towards the end of that century. This city is located in a great valley formed by the last of a series of small mountains called Puuc which cross almost the entire peninsula from southwest to southeast. The most unusual and beautiful of the Puuc-style buildings are in Uxmal. The walls are left plain down to a small socle but are crowned by rich yet well-propor</page><page sequence="31">tioned and harmonious decoralion. One of its outsanding characteristics is the use of stone mosaic for making fine grille-work panels in a rhomboid design: mold ings with fretwork designs; square compartments with beautiful and varied motifs; stylizations of huts, small squares with ornamental symbols, etc. "The Puuc style," says Marta Foncerrada de Molina, "returns their autonomy to architecture and sculpture and achieves such a balance between the two that its impossible to imagine a Puuc building without sculptured decoration or the sculp ture without the building that sustain it. .. fretwork and grille-work, columns and tholobates, masks and serpents, are harmoniously combined to achieve absolute for mal equilibrium." The flowering of the Puuc style is usually placed in the period between 633 and 987 A.D. The cutting and fitting of the stone for the decoration of the facades in Uxmal achieved a perfection unequaled in any other part of the Maya area. The buildings in which the original style of architecture of Uxmal may be admired are mainly the groups of the Nunnery and the Governor's Palace. Close to the latter building is the House of the Turtles, so-called because of the motif that runs along its frieze. The simplicity and serenity of its lines and the smooth clean walls, interrupted only by the well arranged frieze that frames them, make the struc ture comparable to the best balanced Greek architecture. The Quadrangle of the Nunnery is another extraordinary example of balance, beauty and good proportion. To one side of it is the imposing and majestic Temple of the Magician, dominating the entire city. This great pyramid is elliptical in plan and went through at least five stages of construction. Everything in Uxmal gives an impression of serene majesty. A little to the southeast of Uxmal is Kabah, another of the New Empire cities which may be distinguished from the others by its great sculptural-architectural rich ness. The Chenes style which represents the most baroque phase of the Mayan archi tecture of Yucatan seems to reach its peak in this center: "The architecture is characterized by facades totally covered by elaborate decorations having a wild movement of juxtaposed elements within the rigid framework of the architectural form that seem to be fighting to destroy its balance. Chenes decoration represents the plastic expression of the ancient element of the mask which is converted into an obsession in Chenes, annulling the architecture to create a new form..." Ac tually, it is in Kabah that the mask of Chac, God of the Rain, invades not only the copings of the facades but start from the very base of the buildings; the great proboscis of this god seems to grow out the earth itself like the roots of the many trees that seek to extract a little moisture from below to slake the scorching thirst of the inhabitants of the inhospitably dry land. There is another center to the south of Kabah on what is now the Yucatan Campeche border. Uittle reconstruction has been carried out there and most of the buildings are still covered by the forest. Only three are known: The Lookout, the Ball Game, and the Palace. The last building is undoubtedly one of the most outstanding of all the Mayan architecture of Yucatan. As Enrique Juan Palacios says "If the Palace of the Governor and the Nunnery building in Uxmal were not in existence, one could reasonably think on seeing this superb building rising amidst the hostile jungle foliage, that it was the most splendid the Mayas had ever built." Indeed, when one stands before this grand structure for the first time he has the impression that it is a building of various stories. Actually, it does not have three floors; the il lusion arises from the fact that each of its three sections is stepped, in tiers, one behind the other upon each of three terraces. This is another of the Mayan works that calls to mind Greek architecture in its beautiful proportions and because of some of its logically and organically arranged architectural elements. Thus, in the lowest section of the building there is a facade with columns very similar to the pri mitive Doric columns supporting stone lintels or beams, and in the spaces between the columns there may be seen bundles of little butting columns decorated with ties that are possibly a transferral into stone of techniques of wood construction of other times. Then there is a coping and great frieze which runs the length of the extension of rhis first section which is also decorated with bundles of little columns but without ties, alternating with masks of the God of Rain, all topped by another coping similar to the one below. The second section has alternate porticos and doors and blocks with small round moldings. The third section has a very simple, almost</page><page sequence="32">unadorned facade, more in keeping with the purest Puuc style. Its walls are plain as well as its coping which has no other decoration than its double cornice. Some big panels at the axis of the lower doors, with projecting elements, break the mono tony of this great coping. The building of Sayil synthesizes the geometrical and orderly sense that char acterizes Maya thinking; there is a feeling here, as in the best of the Greek monu ments, of magnitude, balance and proportion. Will the archaeological work and ethno-historical, linguistic, and all other kinds of investigations related to the study of the Maya past, make it possible to fully unravel the mystery in which one of the greatest civilizations of the American con tinent is locked?
