<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMAL BEHAVIOR ANIMAL SOCIETIES: FROM THE BEE TO THE GORILLA, by Remy Chauvin. 1968. Hill and Wang, Inc., New York. 281 pp. $6.50. In the burgeoning field of animal behavior studies no sector is likely to be of greater interest to the general reader than that which deals with social relationships among individuals within a species. Books dealing with animal societies are not lacking. Leaving aside the superficial and the romantic as well as the purely technical, most such books treat of single species or of limited groups, reaching, perhaps, to the taxon- omic level of class. The present work, on the other hand, deliberately seeks to encompass both the invertebrate and the vertebrate worlds. It does so, how- ever, in a somewhat selective manner. Part One is titled "Insect Societies" but it is concerned chiefly with hymenop- terans and termites. Part Two is titled "A Return to Our World: Societies of Higher Animals," but it is concerned principally with birds and mammals. This organization exemplifies the theme of the book: the dichotomy between in- vertebrate and vertebrate schemes of social organization. Almost exactly one-third of the book is devoted to bees. As editor of the monumental Traite de Biologie de L'Abeille, Chauvin is to be pardoned for this emphasis. Unfortunately, all topics that follow the apian discourse seem, in contrast, rather arbitrarily selected and loosely connected. Indeed, a chapter on migrations under "Insect Societies" has half its pages devoted to mammals. So much for gallic logic! The writing style is simple and con- versational and it makes the most of reader curiosity while deftly retaining an experimental viewpoint devoid of anthropomorphism. Several dozen pho- tographs add some interest but are not very well tied to the text and are, per- haps, to be ascribed to the publisher. (In No. 23, grey geese are given the binominal belonging to the European crane.) However, effective use is made of line drawings and diagrams. A book written originally in French and translated (by George Ordish) for a British audience exhibits some pe- culiarities that the American publishers did not trouble to mitigate. Spelling divergencies will not bother the reader and possible confusion between species, such as European and American robins, is not likely to hinder comprehension. A more serious fault is the brief French-oriented bibliography. Chauvin cannot be accused of chauvinism, how- ever, for the examples in his text are drawn from the entire world literature of his subject. But have the publishers lost somewhere a list of references? Throughout the book the names of authors are liberally sprinkled, often with publication dates. Nowhere, how- ever, is there a listing of these authors and their publications. Thus, though the book may open a door of interest, further passage is barred.
