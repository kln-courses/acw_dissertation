Bot. Fennici 27:337-352. Helsinki. ISSN 0003-3847 The aim of the study was to analyse the variation of the urban vegetation in Helsinki and the neighbouring suburban city of Espoo in relation to land use, and to provide a classification of urban habitats. The study sites covered a gradient from the urban centre to suburban and recreational forests. The variation between urban and forested sites formed the most important compositional gradient of the vegetation. The second most important gradient was the gradation from shaded moist sites to dry and open ones within the urban areas. The samples were divided into nine vegetation classes, four of which were forest and five urban types. The division of the forests was determined by the fertility of the site, which was connected with human influence. The division of the urban sites was mainly determined by land use. The vegetation of the urban areas was more heterogeneous than that of the forest sites. The urban vegetation consisted predominantly of species groups which tolerate frequent dis turbance, e.g. annuals, grasses and species originally living beside water. Species originating from herb-rich forests were also common. We discuss the degree of urbanization of the vegetation of Helsinki and its surround ings.
