<plain_text><page sequence="1">Discussions Baits and traps REMO GUIDIERI translated by llya Bernstein 1. In an essay written in 1983 ("Essay on the Loan"), I concluded my critique of Marcel Mauss's thesis by examining those types of objects that Malinowski compared to royal insignia and Mauss called "talismans."1 I referred to the mwala and the vaygu'a, objects that circulate in the "deferred transactions" of the "kula-ring" (a term forged by a remarkable commentator on Malinowski's Argonauts, Singh Uberoi).2 I had already had occasion to comment on them in an earlier essay, "Kula, or On The Swindle."3 But now I extended the hypothesis (for the time being, I will describe only its foundations) to other objects, some of which are mentioned in Mauss's excursus ("coats of arms," "talismans," "precious objects," "effigies," "coins"); and some of which are present in abundance in archaic cultures and, if not destroyed after use, can serve as points of entry into circuits of exchange or usury? according to the principle that by receiving one is constrained to give back in return. I will attempt to formulate this hypothesis, to clarify the use of such categories as "bait" and "trap," and to render more precise in non-aesthetic terms things that are more and more often included in the aesthetic sphere, engulfed within the "pan-aestheticism" of our age of monotonous homogeneity. My project therefore has two aims: one is anthropological?to clarify comparatively the properties that certain objects ("valuables") would have in a society in which the coin has not yet fully assumed the role of a universal equivalent (or in which the coin does not exist; this brings us back to Mauss's preoccupations in his Essay and to those of Thurwald and Malinowski before him); the other aim is to suggest that in a time of generalized aestheticization, the recurrent aesthetic metaphors can no longer explain non-western objects, whether tools or masks or effigies, or legitimate their nature, which is connected first and foremost to their explicit or implicit function, not to their superficial aesthetic characteristics. The two aims intersect, if it is true that anthropology, when it is critical and effective, is thought; not a discipline, but a critique of values that no longer have any worth. 2. Trap. Mekhan?: Simulate. Above all else, conceal. Even the bait, part and parcel of the trap (what is a trap without a bait? without something to put on display?), conceals; it conceals the real intent. It waits for the prey?a prey that will fall for it, a prey that wants the bait. The lure works when there is a desire. It waits; inert, or almost. When the right moment comes, it moves; it goes off. The right moment, apart from a misstep)?though this is something that may also happen?is provided by a yearning: a hunger; or by curiosity, which is also hunger. The trap is a box, a hole, but an ornamented one (hence, the Greek tragic scene). It is a spring; a net. A curled-up thread; a tapestry of sticks, craftily arranged. It is a travesty; everything concurs to make something seem normal that is, in reality, just the opposite. It must attract by virtue of its normality. Above all, it must persuade. It must make normality coincide with something that is not normal and therefore is a threat. Coincidentia oppositorum. (Aristotle's perfect mekhan? is the cyclos: the circle.) But this apparent normality is not merely false; it also possesses something different, a dissonance, a flaw, that attracts, that must draw the one who finds it closer, that must lead him to fall inside it. The effect of the trap is a type of catharsis; the tension of the spring, of the desire, is released. There would be much to say about the relation between the trap and the entrapped, the ignorant or the consenting victim. Aristotle's Poetics also addresses the trap, since it also addresses the spectacle. As does Duchamp's Large Glass and many of his notes, concerned as they are with 1.

(Bologna, 1973).</page><page sequence="2">126 RES 32 AUTUMN 1997 "illustrating" the climax of the erotic-sensual tension, the defloration of the Bride. Which is to say that mekhan? is the Double Helix called the Chain; and that "even" the relations among living beings, beginning with humans, cannot escape?despite all attempts at neutralization: doxa, cures, and the advice of sophists and priests?from consenting or mindless or Pinocchio-like entrapment. Duality introduces error: falsehood. It conceals the unseen. Falsehood, pretense?and uncertainty. The objects lead into error?and then reveal it, or have the power to do so. The trap reveals; reveals death, the absence of liberty. The bait is the outward appearance; is anything behind it? The trap is not the bait; but without the outward appearance, there is no trap. This dialectic is vertiginous, above all when it ends up in something reduced, minimal, where the victim perishes, prise au pi?ge, and where the masking effect is consummated; it begins by displaying in order to conceal; proceeds with its effect?to lead into error; and concludes with the fatal revelation, which the "inside" exposes to him who has penetrated into it. I am speaking of the trap and the mask. I could extend the argument to sexuality, with the eye of the mask, and start again. I could add sacrifice. But I stop here. 3. Mekhan?: "The common meaning is Mekhan?, makhana, in the sense of a "means"(;) . . . also "machine" in a material sense, said especially of a war machine or of a piece of theatrical machinery, as well as any other type of means, combination, invention, sometimes used negatively" (P. Chantraine, Diet. Etymologique de la langue grecque, vol. 3 [Paris, 1974], pp. 699-700). A trap is a mask. It shows, it hides. It is a double object. The mask also captures. But I cannot call it simply a trap. It is a trick (true), whose dissimulation might be physical?or not. It is also trueco (deception), which comes from the same word. Cosmetics is a trick; in French, maquillage. I might say that masks and make-up are not merely similar, but consequential; that one follows the other. But I could not say which comes first. I could go even further. I could say, for example, that "technically" make-up is more accessible than the thing that covers (the face), the mask. The two may be encountered together (a mask requires the masking of the entire body; a mask is not a simple assemblage that leaves the body open?I am speaking here of masks, not of the objects classified as such but that are not masks because they are not portable; as for instance certain "Dogon" masks, enormous objects that are never carried). But there are also cultures that use make-up without using (knowing) the mask (Australia and all of Polynesia, for example). 4. They are gadgets, whatchamacallits, thingamajigs, incurrently functional?or rigorously contradictory. They exploit the two eternal ontic halves: inside, outside. We must ask ourselves?without being able to answer? whether or not such gadgets are ontically anterior to the mask, for the mask is also a bait/trap and the latter is also a mask. The object that shows and hides, be it a bait or a mask, must always be considered as an expression oriented towards an external utility that?and this is the problem that must be explored and that has never been explored?has to do with a thetic duality, proper to any natural or man-made entity that embodies the inside/outside. I contend, aware of the banality I am repeating, that such a duality is ontological, in the sense of being intrinsic to any entity that is recognized as such by the understanding, and that it forms the limit underlying the creation of all gadgets that are used for showing and hiding. The utility that they are used for consists to a great degree of showing the danger of the double and of exploiting it (just as the two poles in the phenomenon of electricity are exploited, for example). There would be no instrumental tricks if being were One: a non-dual being, that is, something truly inert. We, like the ancients, know that this doesn't exist. Perhaps we moderns no longer know how to think the One; to think the beyond in which duality vanishes?and with it, therefore, the mask and the trap. A singular situation of the spirit, in which humanity pursues duality and ever more ignores the possibility of thinking the One, while for millennia it had been capable of thinking something that does not exist; thinking it and subordinating itself to it. 5. It is therefore necessary to begin with a minimal taxonomy of these baits/traps, which apply a fatal bite in two moments: that of masking and that of unmasking. For there are many such objects, in many instances archaic, in other cases ex-archaic (but still in use), and in others contemporary, in the sense that they are distinctly circumscribed but deeply ubiquitous (aesthetic objects)?plus, all the traps strictly-so-called: traps</page><page sequence="3">Guidieri: Baits and traps 127 connected with war and with the hunt; traps of love; economic traps. I will list some of the ones contained in the anthropological thesaurus. Among them are the objects included in the inventory of Mauss's Essay: ornaments, coats of arms, "valuables" in the most generic sense of the term, "would-be coins" or "pre-coins"; bracelets, necklaces, rugs, "escutcheons" (the bronzes of the Northwestern coast of America); other "necklaces" (which are not necklaces), Melanesian "shell-money" (which is not money), Amerindian wampum. Significantly excluded from this class, which I would call the class of parures (ornaments), are objects-effigies, explicitly zoo-anthropomorphic or the reverse, an iconic. Also excluded, therefore, are objects that can be grouped according to the principle of containing, that is to say containers, boxes, and bundles, all generally used in witchcraft (Africa, Oceania, the Americas) and not necessarily?in fact, quite rarely?displayed as ornaments (although examples of this also exist, particularly among North American cultures, for example the feathered sticks of various nomadic Amerindian societies). I would suggest, for a provisional list, the following classes: 1. parures, ornaments 2. containers 3. effigies 4. utensils For the time being, I'm leaving out dwellings (which are containers that, in many archaic cultures, have strong connotations, for example Melanesian men houses, the "sanctuaries" of West Africa, and custom houses, particularly in Maori culture) and monumental statues (such as the Hawaiian heia'u sites upon which various grand effigies were displayed). This classification is still summary, but it is based upon a clear comparative approach, which will deserve to be adopted only if the hypotheses on which it is founded are proved to be pertinent, that is, fruitful (and assuming that anthropology can still entertain this level of ambition). 6. I propose the following definitions for each class. Parures, ornaments (jewels, gems; Lat. gemma, the eye of the flower). Ornament?the term is adequate but still approximate. Gem is inaccurate. Any type of dress, or almost any, is a parure, a word that comes from para?tre, or "to appear," "to seem," "to show oneself," the prefix par, meaning "outward" (for example pardessus, or "overcoat"): "to show oneself," the "self." To be is (also?) to show-oneself. But self-showing implies ostentation. One makes oneself seen. One hollow space, partial or complete, joined to another: the body (the skin, and everything that's on the outside). The parure-as-such is a thing that is placed on the naked body. Perhaps tattoos and cosmetics (body-paintings, present in almost every culture, exotic, ancient, or not) are also parures, versions of the para?tre, the appearance. "Man?a soul that walks and wears clothes" (Descartes). But they are parures, or ephemera, used under certain circumstances, whether they are ephemeral or lasting, unalterable (tattoos). As for the objects investigated by Mauss, he proposes a "magic" thesis that states that they contain a property, a quidditas of potentia and a peculiar principium individuationis, as a result of which the subject and the object pertaining to it are not merely correlated but coincide with one another ("that which belongs to me is a part of me": this is a prelogism ? la Levi-Bruhl and the most common, bourgeois "sense of property"), which is supposed to thrust them into circulation (and Mauss's thesis on mana, which I have criticized together with the one suggested by L?vi-Strauss against Mauss on the floating, or zero, signifier, certainly has to do with parures, not effigies, containers, or utensils). Therefore, it is necessary to define the specific type of bait/trap that the parure embodies. The parure is a garment (vestimenta), something designed to put into relief the person who is wearing it (thus the hat, which is?also?a mask). It covers; it "evidences" the parts of the body that it contains. This "evidencing" leads to a dialectic (at what point can a dialectic begin??this question is as crucial, and as aporetic, as the object that is itself a parure, namely, the mask; at what point, in terms of construction, weight, and functionality, can an object that shows-and-hides be called a mask?) between that which is put into relief and that which, precisely, is altered because it is enhanced by the parure. "The savage and the dandy," wrote Baudelaire, "with their naive taste for the shiny, for gaudy feathers, for iridescent fabrics, for the superlative majesty of artificial forms, attest to their disgust with the real, and therefore prove, without knowing it, the immateriality of their soul."4 The observation of the 4. Baudelaire, Oeuvres, ed. H. Pichois (Paris, 1961), pp. 1182-1185.</page><page sequence="4">128 RES 32 AUTUMN 1997 expert dandy that I cite here leads me to add?for the archaic objects I am looking at, as well as those that have always been a part of the philosophie de l'habillement of which Balzac also spoke?that the ornament presupposes a void, an empty "inside," to be trans-dressed (tras-vestito). This property is metacultural, without frontiers; it was referred to even by a Nietzsche, when he spoke of the veil (vestimenta) that covered the statues of classical Greece to conceal the void. Concealment, here, stands for seduction. I cannot present the enormous dossier on masks and masking (which includes precisely that which, programmatical ly, makes itself seen: spectaculum), from masks to make-up, and all of the artifices that either cover up "imperfect nature" to show a "more perfect" one in its place (this is Baudelaire's argument in The Painter of Modern Life) or else evoke something that would not have been visible otherwise (ritual, theater, and the numerous hybrids between them). I distinguish between parures and effigies on the (simple) basis of icon ?city. Only the latter resort to it, even when they are masks. For the parures, it is the function of putting-on display that should be emphasized. This function represents the convergence of the devices associated with the trap?the object that illustrates, as a kind of condensation, the entire process. The paradigmatic example was offered years ago by the "magic of beauty" (megwa: a term that unites magic and beauty) described by Malinowski in the rites of Trobriand (Melanesia) in the context of a supposed reciprocity. Putting-on-display, whatever its subsequent purpose, aims to reform the natural, always assuming that it must be incomplete, if not imperfect. It certainly aims to correct it; not necessarily with a view to making it perfect, but to accentuate the artificiality that is a "natural" condition of human beings, in Paris as in Kiriwina, Trobriand Islands. 7. Containers. Containers are distinguished from parures not because they are not displayed (they are, although their display is usually discreet and probably leads to their opening), but rather because of their functional character (owing to which they are easily adopted? aestheticized?by the West) of assembling and preserving other objects or materials. They contain?or remain empty?the banal and vertiginous capacity of the cavity. They contain, which also means they protect. Things and materials deposited in the container are partially torn out of the external cycle: decadence, dispersion. A wooden container means that one must think the cavity, to hollow out a solid piece of wood; but also the thing by which it will be opened and closed, the cover or door, in accordance with its volume, its capacity, and the need for easy access. Much has been written in the grand tradition of comparative religions on the Door. Much remains to be said about its near-equivalent, the Cover. In addition, there are containers that not only preserve and conceal, but also produce "manipulative" effects, as a result of which the canonical distinction between magic and witchcraft, sorcery, becomes conventional and weak, since the "positive" work of the former can be transformed into the "negative" function of the latter. This transformability is similar to the pharmakon of glorious memory: poison and remedy. The examples are countless, both exotic and otherwise. These are things that function like a knife; by excising, they can either kill or cure. A reading of Malinowski's admirable Magical Gardens and of Evans-Pritchard's classic Witchcraft and Sorcery among the Zande will provide striking examples of their use in African and Melanesian contexts. Containers may be either rigid receptacles or bags, sacks. They contain objet-trouv?s, mineral, vegetal, human fragments. They exploit?this, at least, is the single most noticeable thing about them?the proximity of factually heterogeneous materials, which promises an "efficacious" overcoming of their substantive and formal heterogeneity without, however, attaining the result that magic, at least in its Western definition, aims for?their intermixing, that is, their material transformation (when this actually occurs, as in Africa, those who are in a position to accomplish it are feared, and form a special caste: these are the blacksmiths). These combinations of materials are "raw"; that is, they manifest the distinct properties of the assembled fragments, to which different powers are attributed?which is not all that different, in a lesser key, a much lesser one, from all those trouvailles of contemporary aesthetics?and preserved by the container and utilized later, when the container is opened and they "shine forth." The effect that the preservation and the subsequent exhibition must produce is therefore ambiguously tangible, being invisible. If the physical properties of the assembled materials are seen (color, consistency, form), then their release is tangible only in the attained result: cure, disease. The pharmakon of the invisible; magic and</page><page sequence="5">Guidieri: Baits and traps 129 witchcraft presuppose not only the aura, but also what we call magnetic fields: powerful and (therefore) invisible. Within it, time and space become disfigured, deformed, since the idea of the limit vacillates and loses consistency. The remarkable power of the human spirit when, contemplating the unlimited, it transgresses all that might?through fear or convention?constrain it. This was what, in the final analysis, the Surrealists so admired. No wonder, then, that such containers do not circulate at all (I know of no ethnographic examples that prove the contrary). They are unique creations, made by those who possess them. They are "compositions" (and it's also for this that we, today, admire them aesthetically), something between potions, miniature Wunderkammern, the casual-and-ordered accumulation of memories in an old drawer, Cadavre exquis, cards laid out for a game of solitaire, papiers coll?s and other montages (Schwitters, Rauschenberg), and the pataphysical compounds of Dr. Faustroll. What we call poeticity, beaut? convulsive, explosante-fixe (A. Breton), is something far more serious for him who uses it for malevolent or benevolent purposes (only those artists who deserve to be artists are aware of this)?purposes known as magic and witchcraft. Therefore, there are no transactions involving containers, which are marvelous because they are feared; but it is they that help to bring about and to display the relations?symmetrical ones, if one wishes?between the agent, who manipulates them, and the victim (or the patient, who is the victim of another kind of agent). The container transmits and receives, which is enough to exclude it from circulation. It is likely that there are connections between the arious (countless) containers (area, cystis) and the first :d last Container, Terra. I can discern some of them at have to do with burial. Often, the contents of :haic objects is funereal?they are, at bottom, craters d funerary urns, which act as substitutes, or are ended to act as substitutes, for the graves that hold ? remains. The problem is to determine whether that /ity?which exiles them from the earth?bestows on its contents a particular character for which the ne "funereal" would only be a facile metaphor. Even rchaic tombs are often furnished, which is to say imposed," the arrangement of such elements in a :Cific container probably requires more subtle nipulations, as well as an exact idea of the nposition and how to proceed from it to other npositions once the container is opened and it becomes necessary to rearrange its contents. Whether the object is rigid (box) or not (pouch), it is clear that it is the existence of an autonomous container that enables the manipulation of materials involved in the practice of witchcraft. I would suggest that containers form the class of objects that lend themselves best to manipulation (as opposed, for example, to the parures), in the sense that they exploit the dialectic between hiding and revealing by using an empty space (cavity) that is circumscribed by an envelope that conceals and preserves it, thereby also preserving its contents. The containers?to return to modern themes?pertain to that metaphysics of the box that was referred to by de Chirico and the entire poetics of the objet-trouv?. 8. Effigies. I have already discussed this category elsewhere.5 Apart from the iconicity, hybrid or not, that distinguishes it from the container?which may also contain iconic features, volumetric or otherwise, in the shape of the receptacle?the effigy unites the attributes of the parure and the container. It is an extreme and tangible form of masking, whether it is an actual mask (the hollow effigy) or a statue (the solid effigy). The mask is worn as if it were a hat and, therefore, inhabited by him who wears it (and can be the source of a possession, since the mask is often the means by which such an effect takes place; one might recall Laurence Olivier's words concerning such metamorphoses: "The actor who fails to free himself from the role after the performance becomes very ill and is in danger"). The archaic statute is also inhabited. To overlook this, or simply not to understand its meaning, is the (Western) premise of its aestheticization. It incarnates; this word says everything. It incarnates as much as the mask. It acts, even without being acted upon like the mask, that is worn for the specific purpose of incarnation. As has already been said, both proceed from the dual principle of inside/outside. In other words, effigies are also containers?in the case of hollow effigies, explicitly so. They are appearances?eidola, personae?that polarize the outward aspect and the concealed inside, orienting the artifice toward one (major) type of appearance: the anthropological, even if it is often a hybrid (zoomorphic and anthropomorphic). A discussion of this hybrid 5. "Statue and Mask: Presence and Representation in Belief," RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 5 (Spring 1983):14-22.</page><page sequence="6">130 RES 32 AUTUMN 1997 formation will be found in the text I have already mentioned. I would add that the theme of the effigy points to a further line of thought, which would determine, approximately, the limit where anthropomorphic iconicity ends and the non anthropomorphic one begins (the distinction between what is and what is not "representable"). It seems unnecessary to insist that all this also entails traps: they not only show, but contain. But this is the only class of objects that does not circulate. Archaic culture might be suited for connoisseurship, but it is not antiquarian; it might be fetishistic, but it is not collectionistic. The iconicity of effigies apparently supplants the other functions: of containing, of setting apart the person who holds them, for example. In other words, iconicity?"putting on show," as long as this remains a central function?appears to neutralize the others, that are, respectively, according to the other classes of objects, displaying with ostentation, containing, concealing, and preserving. In many respects, the effigy's type of iconicity contains them all. But, whether it's a mask or a statue, or even a statue with an actual closet inside it (I am thinking of certain Polynesian effigies, as well as other ones, from Africa ), the volume effigy (in other words, I am not considering images traced on a surface, petroglyphs, wall paintings, etc.) aspires to go beyond the other functions by means of an effect that might be linked to the effect of speech: by evoking, by "rendering present." It would be naive and fruitless to conclude that the effigy "serves" as speech; or, worse still, to say that the effigy is a complement to speech: that it "says" what the latter has already said. The semiological simplifications (which are still current) obliterate the determination that is essential to both forms of expressivity, linguistic and iconic (more precisely: symbolic for speech, iconic for effigies), which concerns optics, that is, the (inevitable and crucial) experience of perception; and which is based not only on the gnoseological dichotomy embodied by the two modes of expression?restoring for sight or speech what has already been perceived and reassembled by the understanding,?but to modalities that are capable of taking in everything that is accessible to the understanding, only in different ways?with different effects. In the archaic artifacts of non-literate cultures, this dichotomy?which is so fruitful for the purposes of iconicity?is, so to speak, naked; it is not enough to suppose that in ritual, where both are often present, language would have the function of mediating for the effigy, or vice versa. Both are mediations in and of themselves. It would be wrong to look here for that function of the image?illustrating a narrative that starts with a word, prior to the image?of which Alberti spoke in reference to the Arts (and which the propaganda of the mass societies of our own century promoted as well). The effigy does not "signify"?as we, Moderns, now know?but actually exhibits, crudely, all that speech cannot understand and cannot show. The dichotomy derives from the eternal (and meta-cultural) conflict, for the understanding, between the concrete and the abstract. The whole business of the so-called reciprocity in the exchange called gift-giving?which is rather a form of deferred barter or simply usury, with its dynamics of the obligation to give back?concerns the objects that I call baits/traps, principally parures. I maintain that the bait, the appearance, an appearance that conceals and masks, also attracts, and thereby excites a need, a desire that was hitherto absent or dormant. This need, re awoken, forms a bond, which is a noose; not the "obligation of reciprocity," as Mauss and his epigones maintain; more simply and brutally, the obligation to give back; in this case, the obligation to be caught in the trap: to be not free. Speaking of reciprocity here is like speaking of a reciprocity?simplified to the point of absurdity?between Master and Slave or between usurer and debtor. It reduces to nothing the very thing that structures this type of relationship: the inequality between the two parties, the dependence of one on the other, and the bundle of motivations involved in the desire (appetitio, cupiditas). The problem is to determine whether such a nexus requires something tangible,?as the archaic examples that Mauss cites in his theory of the Gift attest,?a symbolon in the original meaning of the term, a broken bone, whose unity can be restored only fictitiously and falsely, and whose fragments are unequal. In other words, whether it is necessary to exhibit a series of objects?such as the agalmata, which is crown, statue, and noose?in order to attract the one who will become the victim, beyond the satisfaction of need through autarchic consumption and barter. 9. Utensils. An "extension of the hand" (Leroi-Gourhan), the utensil is an addition, an "extra" that must supply what's lacking. It defines, inductively, the human condition in the anthropological sense: man is a being</page><page sequence="7">Guidieri: Baits and traps 131 that lacks what the utensil gives him. Hence, it is his imperfection, or incompleteness, that the utensil underscores. There is no human culture that does not have utensils. The utensil is the first orthopedic device? at least the kind that exteriorizes by means of a concrete object (one may suppose that language, which is itself an instrument, is another). The term "orthopedics" must, nevertheless, be defined more precisely. The orthopedic substitute, whatever its form and function, is generally a double (a walking stick is "another leg"), a simulacrum of that which is not there. The utensil isn't. To stick to the archaic examples under discussion, that is, excluding the immense arsenal of utensils?useful or not?that has been and continues to be produced by modern technology, I should like to cite various comments of Plato's on the eidos of the utensil to say that it involves a means (medium) determined by two necessities?needs and ends (culturally variable, but sharing a common threshold: subsistence); it is a form whose effectiveness (utility) is derived from the needs it embodies, as the trans-cultural evidence of the ethnoarcheological inventories of the basic archaic utensils attests, with their striking formal and functional homogeneity. The reference to Plato is not an empty one. The relation of the utensil-form to its model-form (arche) is not mimetic, except in the sense that the idea (the model) turns into the object (the utensil). Therefore, the utensil possesses no iconicity, except a purely ideational and hypothetical one, between the model and the object. Only when the latter actually exists as such does the series of utensils show that it consists of copies of the "first" utensil: archaic ready-mades. Utensils are mekhan?; they attract and condense. From the ax and its variations, to the javelin, the bow, the various blunt objects used to wound and kill, and the variations on the blade in wood and stone, they are forms that absorb power and increase it. The form condenses?through a multiple and rigorously harmonious relationship between the volume, density, and maneuverability of the materials, a balance between the weight and the effect, and a complementarity between the ability to create and use the form and its effectiveness?the power that man lacks. An implicit (and fundamental) theory of power underlies the eideticity of the utensils. In part, it is concretized in the object, that is, in a form; in part, it is expressed in its effectiveness, since the archaic utensil is the merging point of a more vast conflagration? admitted, but only partially recognized?of invisible forces. Magic causality operates, imperatively, precisely through this invisibility. Every efficient cause is therefore double: resulting from human action, in this case the utensil, and from the irreducible forces surrounding it. Those who accept the powerful determinations of magnetic fields, known or unknown, effective and invisible,?the very thing accepted by science,?ought not to be astonished, the way so many "theorists of magic" always have been. What is peculiar, as Wittgenstein thought, is not that magic is a form of causality, but that every causality is magical. The utensil is also a means of partially capturing those forces. It draws them toward itself; this is what the "miracle" of the utensil is all about. But without being in a position to gather all of them. And therefore, it is an incomplete "tractor." Its efficacy becomes complete only if it evokes the forces surrounding it: archaic (as well as non-archaic . . .) work and technology invariably employ magic acts, which are governed by the principle of "saying equals doing." These determinations orient the meaning of the attraction and the capture, the entrapment, of forces, in a radically different way from the trap-objects we have so far examined. In the utensil, the hidden is invisible because it is not human. Therefore, it can be used only for creating relations that couple technology with magic. 10. Of the four classes we have examined, two are objects that circulate: parures and utensils (or at least their durable parts: thus, for the axe, the stone, but not the handle). And two, only very rarely (effigies) or never at all (containers strictly-so-called). But all of them are traps: they attract and imprison. In my article on the false gift (contra Mauss), I suggested that such objects appear to nurture something that comes into being only when it becomes visible (shows itself).6 This is evident, for example, in the case of effigies: whatever the subject, at least in the sphere we have chosen (archaic culture), divinity or ancestor (or merely the deceased), the effigy lets people see what otherwise would have remained unrepresentable?at least iconically, since the concepts themselves, "divinity," "ancestor" (along with their proper names) are already representations. Once more, I maintain that traps are not objects of 6. L'abondance des pauvres (see note 1 ), p. 74.</page><page sequence="8">132 RES 32 AUTUMN 1997 exchange and therefore do not foster any kind of reciprocity. They create relations of one particular type only, liaisons dangereuses, such as the ones aforementioned. There is something compelling about them that is similar to, and perhaps even stronger than, the drive to satisfy the survival instinct?life's first imperative. They follow it, but are no less powerful. They know of ways to intersect it. The purpose of the baits/traps is to make the survival instinct tangible. Mauss (despite being so powerfully attracted by magic: his reading of the "Gift" is a confirmation of the "theory" of magic) attempted to take the magic out of the "gift" relation by supposing that there existed a circularity among the things that entered into it, even if, as I wrote in 1983, "he who gives a gift does not simply give, and thus he traps the recipient, who, for his part, knows that the Gift is not real; the giver gives, therefore, in order to obligate the other, who, in one way or another, believes that there is "no obligation" (that is, believes in the "gift")."7 It would suffice, I would add now, to eliminate the false hypothesis of circularity, to correct the hypothesis of exchange ("a" gives "b," and reciprocally), in order to show that the thing that attracts, and that is therefore precious, establishes a relation that is different from exchange and lies beyond the necessities of survival. This is a powerful relation, far more mobile than any presumed and rigid reciprocity. A successful relation, which relies on reciprocity only in a metaphoric sense, and not always; which reveals how little reciprocity there is between the giving and the receiving, both driving forces, but not equivalent ones, that is asymmetrical; whose impulse, whose origin, cannot be reduced to a binary form that would repeat itself into infinity (the chain of reciprocity, as L?vi-Strauss would have us believe). The relation is singular, because the intentions are singular: to attract, to be attracted. A sort of subverting clinamen, which disrupts obliquely and forms a noose. In other words, something without regularity, something that cannot be identified with exchange or with barter or with matrimony (in those transactions that appear symmetrical). Finally, it is a relation that is possible only with the aid of specific objects, which are, principally, ornaments (parures). Their function and their nature is "to show." They have a "force," as Mauss would have put it. But their end is to bind, to imprison, not to thrust into circulation. Does this "force" link them to coins (Mauss went so far as to treat them as such)? Or would it not be enough to say that they are traps? For they are used as though the difference between appearance and substance, between the external and the internal (and not between identity and possession, as Mauss maintained: "the thing which is mine is also me . . ."), had become blurred?as long as the effect of the attraction lasts. As long as the attraction lives up to the appearance. But there is an afterwards, and this is the revelation?the cunning unmasked. A bond that ends with a bang. 11. The immoderate will to appropriate, which is common to human beings, concerns, perhaps, things, rather than fellow-creatures. Archaic frugality, which expresses this will (modest means toward modest ends), by no means attenuates it, as is proved by the fact that ritual objects are created in numbers that certainly exceed those of utensils created for the needs of subsistence. Anthropology and, recently, the aesthetics that has learned to exploit it, have stifled?not to say ignored? this need for objects, either explaining it by means of a primitivist ideology that emphasizes the (alleged) frugality of archaic cultures in terms of needs, in terms of the parameters of work and productivity, parameters that are, if anything, purely Western; or else, by thoroughly aestheticizing such objects: by investing them with (alleged) functions whose form prevails over the necessities that have rendered them possible in the first place. Both options are myopic and profoundly related in the way in which they shamelessly beg the question, in their stubborn will to burden the archaic with the common "values," the "universals," of rationality and representative capacity, or else with wisdom (parva moralia) and a "taste for the beautiful" that recalls, at best, that of the antiquarian (connoisseurship), or certain notes from Flaubert's Sottisier. The effects can be traced to the col lection ism and museifying inflation of the last two decades. The pages that follow aim to correct this orientation by developing certain hypotheses about archaic objects that I formulated more than a decade ago in the conclusion of an essay in which I dissociated myself from the post Maussian vulgate concerning the alleged reciprocity of "gift-giving exchange" in archaic societies.8 8. L'abondance des pauvres (see note 1 ). 7. L'abondance des pauvres (see note 1), p. 63.</page><page sequence="9">Guidieri: Baits and traps 133 Since some of the objects that I discussed (on the model of the Trobriandian vaigu'a and mwala, which were integrated by Malinowski into the proven reciprocity of the "kula ring" between Oromakaiva (Trobriand) and Dobu, from which Mauss took his cue, and which became the linchpin of his Essay) concern my critique of the commonplaces about archaic reciprocity, I will now summarize my argument. Donum is not nexum, neither factually nor juridically (whereas Mauss attempts to identify them). Gift-giving is not a form of usury. A gift is not a loan. Gifts and interests are antithetical. The event of the gift (when it really is one) has a remarkable effect on the relationship between the giver and the beneficiary; but there exists no strategy of gift-giving. If anything, only a theodicy. To give with cunning is to make a loan. There exists no archaic attribute, no sort of quidditas of the archaic "gift" or simply of the object given, which can create a magic bond ("the imperative of giving back in return"), a show of respect, as spontaneous as a salute, for the "mystery" of the thing, that would make it circulate from hand to hand?an anthropological echo of that harmony of the spheres that makes them move in the heavens?and, summum miraculum, force it at last to return into the alveolus from whence it came (the "first giver" in L?vi Strauss's schema of asymmetrical exchange in his theory of matrimony, the linchpin of his Structures ?l?mentaires de la parent?): the very hands that had so cunningly given it away to begin with. As an Oceanist anthropologist critiquing Mauss's (and his numerous epigones') definition of mana, this supposed, "magical," ontic attribute of the thing, which translates into a power that forces it to circulate, I proposed to think of it not as a "hidden force," and therefore a threatening one, a "hot potato" tossed from hand to hand (this is the substantivist thesis?Mauss believes in a type of prosaic magic: he is a positiviste spirite, denying any kind of transcendence, but putting his trust in the spiritual force of the "social"). I contested such arguments by pointing out what mana means in all those Oceanic languages. Mana is not a "magic power," which is an incorrect translation, but the "true" (authentikon). For the same reasons, I could not accept its "emancipated," anthropological translation, hostile to spiritual illusions, as a semantical ly neutral quality, common to many languages, a "floating signifier," a "zero signifier," the category of mediocre unnameability, of emptiness, a password, "mac/7/n," "thingamajig" (L?vi-Strauss's emendation of Mauss). Neither an expression of the occult nor of the empty, mana is rather the truth of the thing: its being, experience, condition, accessible and expressible, if only to a limit. The category is an attribute of substance, which is in certain cases equivalent to the attribute of existence (lacking in those languages), which conceptually fixes the manifestation of the authentikon as known to sight and understanding. What I proposed, probing the principal Oceanic categories,9 referred back to the only anthropologist who ever had an intuition of it, A.M. Hocart. Whether or not the "effects" of the true-thing appear "magical" to him who sees it and uses it?the flower that has come to maturity, perfect in form, color, and odor, the useful utensil, the eloquence of the orator? depends on the particular state that the category mana expresses. There is a "phantasmagoria" associated with certain objects, of which the fetish is one. In the case of the objects that circulate ("driven by the mana/' as Mauss understood it), the process to which they are subjected?at least the ones that truly circulate (the Trobriandian vaigu'a and mwala, but certainly not the Kwakiutl copper and the other precious objects arbitrarily piled together by the Maussian "law of reciprocity")?is only partly reducible to a human will that would enforce exchange, confounding the noumenal and the phenomenal, the real and the hallucinatory, necessity and chance, as a result of a noetic naivete (Mauss's "magic thought," L?vi-Strauss's "a thought still mired in the image, which has not yet attained the stage of concept" in Pens?e sauvage) or an "exchangist" itch, specific to certain cultures. The Maussian assumption is equivalent to the fetishistic aspect of commodities in the modern context, the world of commodities and their phantasmagorical proliferation: here, however, the "mana' consists in an anamorphosis of forms and functions that includes high technology, gadgets, and aesthetic objects; the "true," unsteadily held between the pincers of the useful and the empty. Nihilistically, the truth of things is not the ephemeral miracle it appears to be, whose Oceanic name is mana, but a "weak value," in a permanent state of growth and mutation, embodied by commodities. 12. I hold that there exist two classes of objects, which I call extractions and fabrications (utensils require a 9. "Tupu" in L'abondance des pauvres (see note 1), p.86.</page><page sequence="10">134 RES 32 AUTUMN 1997 separate commentary).10 The first are natural objects, fragments extracted from the surrounding world, minerals, pieces of wood, splinters of human or animal bones, dried plants, organic matter, selected in isolation or mixed together for cultic purposes. The second are effigies, hollow (masks) or solid (statues), containers of various types, boxes, screens, parures (for example the Trobriandian vaigu'a and mwala: diadems, bracelets, necklaces from Oceania and America, to stick to the sphere of objects with which I am most familiar). I consider both categories baits and traps. Things that attract and imprison. They must show and reveal (and their prototype might be the mask). Each class has its own modality of showing and hiding, which mainly derives from its morphology. Effigies and parures develop the register of the para?tre, the appearance: they "put on show," and that which they dissimulate goes back, in certain ways that I will discuss in a follow-up of this essay, to Hegel's idea about the Greek Religion of Form. This is a dissimulation that combines the delicate chiasma between the visible and the invisible in the appearance of the non-human or the ex-human entity, the ancestor or the divinity, and the necessity to render visible that which the word only imperfectly expresses. In the case of Extractions, it is their own morphology that renders them, at least initially, inadequate for such a task. As fragments and montages of fragments, they must "valorize" the various morphologies of the organic that oscillate between composition and decomposition, between different combinations that seem to underscore the properties revealed by geometrical and extra geometrical approximations. Extractions and Fabrications represent the two major archaic variants of the relationship conceived by man for dealing with things whose inertia is only apparent. The role of these mekhan?, as understood in the definition given to them by Aristotle, is to transcend (to negate?) the very idea of the inanimate. Such a presupposition has been called animistic. It is archaic, but it is also modern: according to science, nothing, or almost nothing, can be considered inanimate. The common trait of these mekhan? is that they are explicitly contradictory. They embody contradiction; their attributes are in conflict with one another?suffice it to mention the most obvious ones: inert, animate; true, false?; what makes them such is the absence of a resolving dialectic, which exists only where there is no artifice or Darstellung (only the real is dialectical, to quote Hegel). Plato, speaking of the techn? mimetik? in order to explain what simulacra are, and drawing his examples from the class that I call fabrications, already demonstrated their paradoxical nature: "things that are not, that exist." For archaic objects, one might correct the proposition: "things that cannot exist in any other way." But the principal contradiction, which perhaps sums up all the others, concerns their capacity to exploit the properties of showing and concealing, beyond the scope of language. They are forms, not categories. I will indicate some of these contradictions, which hold for both extractions and fabrications. 1. The contradiction between the implicit and the form: that which the concept of mana, by contrast, ephemeral ly resolves. The material form, not being ontically a concept, emblematically (and stably) displays this contradiction. There is in it an explicit and declared irresolvability, much more pronounced than the classic and linguistic irresolvability concerning the arbitrariness of the sign in the relation between the signifier and the signified. This is the origin of that autonomy of form that finds all kinds of uses in human cultures. 2. The contradiction between the causa sui and the causa finalis. Whether it's an extraction or a fabrication, the thing possesses a causa sui, which is autonomous by definition, a sort of quidditas of the thing itself; at the same time it represents a product, an object specifically chosen or made to appear autonomous. A sort of intentional obfuscation takes place here between the two classic causes that, for example, the utensil does not possess (or if it does, as in the archaic sphere, then only in addition to its central function, for example the "ritual axe"). 3. The contradiction between the form and the referent, which we naively believe to be resolved by what we call style. Such a form, or a conjunction of forms, or a montage of fragments of forms, is legitimate only as long as the area of the 'style' remains the same; which is no longer the case even in areas that are still contiguous, but whose styles are already different. 10. Translator's note. The terms prelievi and artifizi, which I have translated as "extractions" and "fabrications," were introduced by Remo Guidieri in Cronaca del neutro e dell'aureola (1991). The two classes of objects to which they refer may be characterized as object metonyms and object-metaphors. Prelievi are "samples" of the surrounding world; artifizi are mimetic representations of it.</page></plain_text>
