<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NGANASAN: WILD REINDEER HUNTERS OF THE TAIMYR PENINSULA CHESTER S. CHARD The evident recency of reindeer domestication at once raises the question of what the culture and life of the tundra zone of arctic Siberia was like before its inhabitants adopted reindeer hus- bandry. This question is not only of general inter- est for culture history- to learn the manner in which this particular habitat was exploited by man for thousands of years-but it also takes us back to the days of postulated contacts and inter- relationships throughout a world-wide circum- polar zone, and to a time when the New World may well have still been receiving cultural increments, if not populations, from the Old. Hitherto, the attempts to penetrate back to this earlier horizon have largely centered on the Yukagir (e.g. Forde 1957: 101-106), a tribe be- lieved to represent the last food-gathering cul- ture on the Siberian tundra. There are many drawbacks that make the historic Yukagir a slen- der reed to lean on. For one thing, it is still de- batable to what extent the Yukagir were genuine food gatherers at the time they came under ethno- graphic scrutiny and whether they did not in fact keep reindeer, although some groups later lost them- a phenomenon not unknown among the Tun- gus, for instance. For another, this people was one of the first to be overrun by the Russians: both the people and their culture were already shattered in the 17th century. With the possible exception of the Kamchadal, no tribe in eastern Siberia was crushed and Russianized so quickly and completely. Moreover, no early explorer left us a picture of the old life of the Yukagir compa- rable to what we have for the Kamchadal. To at- tempt to recreate this after over 200 years of Russianization from the fragments of the old cul- ture remaining at the end of the 19th century among the pitiful surviving remnant, mixed with and influenced by Tungus, Lamut and Yakut as well, was well-nigh hopeless. Jochelson collected his scattered notes on the Yukagir together in his declining years, and the published result is dis- jointed and most unsatisfactory (Jochelson 1926). No coherent picture of an ancient tundra hunting life emerges from it. It should therefore be of considerable interest to learn that on the tundra of the Taimyr Penin- sula, the northernmost part of Siberia (see map, Fig. 1), there lives a tribe of wild reindeer hunters that remained almost completely isolated from modern European civilization until the 1920' s and among whom the old life was largely intact even in the 1930' s when they were studied by a leading Russian ethnographer, A. A. Popov (obituary in Arctic Anthropology, Vol. 1, No. 1). Although this group possesses a limited number of domestic reindeer, the latter are used solely to provide mo- bility, and hunting remains the basis of the econo- my. These northernmost people of the Old World are the Nganasan. Numbering around 700, they represent the most unspoiled native tribe in Si- beria during the first half of the 20th century. Their culture at the time of study reflected an interesting blend of reindeer nomadism and hunting-fishing, with every indication that the latter had predominated in the recent past. Evi- dently this culture is an indirect result of the in- vasion of the tundra by Samoyedic reindeer breed- ers from the south, with subsequent absorption of the aboriginal tundra population. This process of fusion, which brought reindeer husbandry to the western half of the Eurasiatic tundra zone and gave rise to the Samoyed type of reindeer economy, probably took place between the mouth of the Yeni- sei and the mouth of the Ob about 1000 A.D. The resulting people and culture are the Nenets (plural Nentsy), the main group of modern Samoyed (often called Yurak in the older literature). They seem to have been a dynamic people who expanded rapid- ly over the tundra in both directions. On the west, they came in contact with the Lapps, who seem to have borrowed from them the idea of reindeer domestication. To the east, they imposed Samoyedic speech and many elements of culture - including, again, the idea of reindeer breeding- on the aborigines just east of the Yenisei, thus forming the Enets (plural Entsy) or so-called Yenisei Samoyed, from whom these elements spread still further east to the people of the Taimyr Peninsula. The present view- which will be discussed in more detail at the end of this paper- is that this original population of the Taimyr area represented the western periphery of the Yukagir, or at least of the prehistoric cul- ture of the central Siberian tundra from the Kolyma to the Khatanga which archaeologically 105</page><page sequence="2">106 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 shows amazing uniformity over this vast expanse, and which current Soviet opinion associates with the ancient Yukagir. This was a tundra culture of wild reindeer hunters. The Taimyr segment of this came first under Tungus influence- probably, for a guess, around the 15th century-and it was not until as late as the 17th and even 18th centu- ries that it became Samoyedized in language, and emerged as the modern ethnic unit of three groups calling themselves Nganasan. Despite their Samoyed linguistic and cultural overlay, the Nganasan differ from the Nenets (the "typical" Samoyed) in many ways: in dialect; in the fact that wild reindeer hunting plays the vital role in their economy and that their techniques suggest the habits and traditions of foot hunters; in the absence of any stable tradition of reindeer hus- bandry; in their clothing, details of construction of the tipi, types of sled, and distinctive features of their shamanism; and in their traditional atti- tude toward the Nenets as being an alien people. All these suggest that the Nganasan are basically descendents of the ancient tundra population of this part of Asia, and preserve much of the old way of life. We are dealing here with a true tun- dra culture. The edge of the scrub forest forms the southern boundary of their territory. Unfortunately only the first part of Popov's definitive study- that dealing with material culture and economic life- has been published (Popov 1948). Hence a balanced picture of the total cul- ture cannot be presented. Some of the more inter- esting aspects, however, are described in rich detail. Domestic reindeer are used exclusively for transportation. Only under exceptional circum- stances, such as famine, will they be killed for meat. Like the Tungus hunters of the Siberian taiga and the Plains Indians of North America, domestic animals have only increased the ef- ficiency of their ancient way of life and have not basically altered it. Although in recent years the Nganasan have sizeable herds, the old people say that formerly these were very small- no more than ten deer per family- so that people often had to drag their own sleds on the seasonal mi- grations. Even now the deer are comparatively little used in summer, the people preferring to travel on foot- a state of affairs perhaps reflect- ing former conditions. The local domestic rein- deer are of a small tundra race like those of the Chukchi; they are wilder and less well trained than are the deer of the adjoining forest peoples. Often they will run away and join the wild herds. Reflecting the general pattern of Samoyed rein- deer practices, the animals are used for driving only, being hitched two to four (rarely five) per sled, using a harness of Nenets (Yurak) type. They say that in the old days when they had few deer, one would pull a sled alone. Four types of sleds are in use (Fig. 2): 1) a light type for hunting and use in summer (these occur also among the neigh- boring Dolgan and may have been borrowed); 2) the women's or freight sled, which is peculiar to the Nganasan; this is used only in winter and is left behind at the winter camp; 3) the sleds for trans- porting the tipi and household goods, which vary slightly in construction according to the specific load for which they are designed; these are very lightly built and are used both in winter and summer; 4) a special sled for transporting canoes (this is found among the Dolgan and is obviously a borrowing). Such a diversity of sled types, differ- entiated according to specific use, is apparently unique in Eurasia. Herd dogs are of great assistance in rounding up and catching the reindeer, and are also useful in the hunt. The Nganasan supply neighboring tribes with these dogs, which fetch a substantial price. This rather suggests that dog breeding is an old trait with them. Had they formerly used dogs for transport purposes, we may reasonably suppose that this would have ceased with the acqui- sition of reindeer, in view of the greater problems involved in providing food for dog teams. The whole pattern of Nganasan life is geared to hunting- not to reindeer pastoralism. The long seasonal migrations necessitated by a hunting economy apparently keep their deer rather skinny and in generally poor shape, as compared with those of true pastoralists. Since their life is based on hunting, and since the resources of their tundra habitat are strictly seasonal, their economic activities have a marked- ly seasonal character in order to capitalize on the temporary abundance available. The Nganasan reckon two years to one of our own: the four months of summer (May 15 - September 15) are regarded as a year, and the eight months of winter as another. Their annual round of activities may be summarized as follows: The period from December 15 to April 1st is spent in the winter camp at the border of the scrub forest. Life at this time is fairly sedentary and activity is virtually suspended in the darkness and cold. The camp will be moved only when fresh pasture is necessary. The people confine them- selves to herding their deer, gathering fire wood, carrying on a certain amount of trapping for polar foxes, and occasional hunting should any game happen to come their way. Economic activities during this period add very little to their larder,</page><page sequence="3">CHARD: THE NGANASAN: WILD REINDEER HUNTERS 107 and they subsist on what was secured during the summer and fall- the time of most intensive food- getting when they endeavor to lay up stores of food and clothing materials sufficient to last them for the entire year. This winter camp may con- sist of a relatively large number of tipls. At the approach of spring it will break up into small groups of one or two (rarely three) tipis, which constitute independent economic units of a size better suited to exploit a hunting territory. The vast area which would be necessary to support a large group could not be exploited successfully given their primitive methods of communication and transportation. Preparations for the summer hunting begin while it is still winter. The heads of families negotiate as to who will travel together, and fix very precisely the boundaries of the hunting terri- tories so that all will have a fair chance at the game. These boundaries change from year to year, as does the composition of the hunting groups themselves; but they remain fixed until the end of the season. Supplies of lead, powder, shot and percussion caps are secured at this time in exchange for fox skins. A number of extra sets of wooden sled runners are manufactured to be fastened on the underside of the regular sled run- ners for summer use, since the latter would soon be worn down from driving over the often stony tundra. From April 1st to June 15 the people are mov- ing northward over 400 miles on to the tundra as far as the foot of the Taimyr Mountains. How- ever, they never go beyond the latter to the sea- coast. (Over most of arctic Eurasia, people typi- cally avoid the coast). During this period they hunt whatever wild reindeer they happen to come across, using nets and rifles or stalking them be- hind screens. Ptarmigan are also taken in nets. Fox trapping ends the middle of May. Early spring is always the leanest season, and in the old days when they seem to have lacked most of their present hunting equipment, it was a time of hunger. Summer is the busy season: there are myriad waterfowl to trap, eggs to gather, fish to be caught in lakes and rivers, and always the wild reindeer which they attempt to bag at every opportunity. Any dogs which are fidgety or noisy will be kept in the tent or even killed, lest they scare away the game. When the waterfowl moult and are un- able to fly, great numbers are taken by driving into nets- especially geese. Meat, fish and fowl are all sun-dried and stored for the winter; fat is extracted and preserved separately. At this season the adults are occupied with these activities around the clock, and the care of the herd is left to the children; the usual routine of life goes by the board. The people display a seemingly inexhaustible energy at this time that is unbeliev- able; they appear to ignore fatigue. Popov has de- scribed a typical day in the life of a Nganasan family during the second half of July roughly as follows: The head of the family (an elderly man) had been busy fishing until 2 or 3 a.m. His two grown sons took turns guarding the herd at night all dur- ing this period, and so got little sleep. After a brief nap-no more than a couple of hours- they would be off after wild reindeer or participating in the communal drives to net geese. The young daughters would tend the herd during the daytime. The women were busy cutting up the fish, reindeer meat and waterfowl into pieces and hanging them up to sun dry; the waterfowl in particular must be cleaned without delay to avoid spoiling. It is no easy task to eviscerate and cut up in a single day several hundred geese, some dozens of fish and a reindeer or two- in addition to rendering the fat from the guts and skins of the geese and fish. And at the end of the day the women must turn to mend- ing and thoroughly drying the clothing, and especi- ally the footgear, of the hunters. Only towards morning were the women able to snatch a little rest- but no more than two or three hours. Autumn is the time of the great communal rein- deer hunts, when the wild herds are on their south- ward migration. At this season their skin is at top quality, and they are in prime condition and at their fattest. The herd instinct is also at its peak, and only now are the great concentrations found. Beginning about September 1st the people also be- gin to head south toward the forest border. Fish- ing ceases with the freeze -up, and fox hunting and trapping begins. This pattern continues until mid- December when they reach timberline and settle down for the winter. The seasonal migrations of the Nganasan paral- lel those of the wild reindeer around which their economy revolves. The wild deer winter in the scrub zone and start their northward move as early as February, traveling 700 or more miles each spring to the Taimyr highlands and the arctic seacoast to escape the insects, and returning to the scrub again in October and November for winter pasture and shelter, often following the same beaten path. Fawning takes place in May when they have reached their northern destination. During the summer the deer remain in small groups, or even scatter individually, until the rut- ting season in early autumn when the great herds coalesce. The bulk of the hunting is carried out</page><page sequence="4">108 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 between August and November. Although deer are also taken at other seasons, and in fact at any and every opportunity, these will be few in num- ber and in poor condition; hence they do not have much economic significance in the overall pic- ture. The southward-bound herds of autumn will number tens of thousands of animals. The Ngana- san and other reindeer breeders of the area have to take care to move their domesticated herds well out of the way ahead of time, lest they be swept up and carried away by this living ava- lanche. In view of the basic importance of reindeer hunting in the way of life, it is fitting to discuss the methods in some detail. 1. Individual Hunting In winter and spring some hunters stalk deer while concealed behind a plank screen mounted on small runners and provided with a loophole through which to shoot. The front of this screen is camouflaged with plastered snow or a piece of white material. This is reminiscent of the com- parable Eskimo device for stalking over the ice: a white sail mounted on a little sledge. In summer, reindeer are hunted chiefly on foot, and the hunters almost always operate alone. Windy, cloudy days are favored for the purpose, and especially the early morning hours when the senses of the animals seem to function least well. The hunter usually wears old garments with the fur worn off in order to resemble the rocky land- scape as much as possible. When a deer is locat- ed it will be pursued, utilizing whatever natural cover is available, and an effort will be made to head it off. The Nganasan are good runners; sometimes they will have to pursue one deer for six or seven miles until they are in a position for a good shot. Then if the quarry is only wounded, this will involve still further pursuit. Should the hunter succeed in approaching a group of rein- deer, he will often wait until several animals are lined up so that a single bullet may possibly bring down a number at once. Only the most experi- enced hunters can hope to bag as many as five or six out of one group. When a deer is killed, the hunter promptly skins and eviscerates it. Then he makes a sort of scarecrow (e.g. a garment hung on the antlers) in order to protect the car- cass from seagulls, which are a major nuisance to hunters and fishermen. The hunter rarely brings the game home himself; someone from the camp (usually a woman) drives out in a light sled drawn over the bare ground by three or four rein- deer and fetches it back. The hunters themselves only travel by sled in summer when they have to go long distances. At times they will go off on trips of 60 to 100 miles in search of game. And in mid-August parties of hunters go off for several weeks to the slopes of the Taimyr Mountains. Such a party will be accompanied by one woman whose principal duty is to repair their footgear (which is subject to heavy wear in this rocky country) and to sun-dry the meat secured. In ad- dition, she will perform the housekeeping chores. On these expeditions, again, the actual hunting is carried out on foot and individually; the sleds and teams are used only to fetch in the kill. After the first snowfall, however, this hunting on foot is replaced by hunting from sleds, using a light sled and a team of four special deer with which to run down the quarry. These deer are not driven at other times of the year. Does, which are supposed to have more endurance, are gener- ally selected for this purpose. During the rutting season in early autumn hunt- ing is also done with the aid of decoy deer: either a trained doe who is let out on the end of a long rope (around 300 yards) in the direction of a wild herd while the hunter stalks behind, or an un- trained buck selected for his wide, branching antlers. In the latter case, notches are cut in the tips of the antlers and a sinew cord in the form of a noose is stretched over them, its end being firmly tied to the base of the antlers. This is done with the aim of getting the buck involved in a fight with a wild male whose antlers will then become entangled in the noose. To make sure of luring such a rival into combat, the decoy's antlers will be moistened with reindeer urine, or a piece of skin taken from the sexual organ of a slain wild buck will be attached to the antler. The decoy is then turned loose in the direction of the wild herd, and when it has succeeded in thus snaring a buck the hunter will rush up and despatch the animal. To prevent these decoys from escaping, the Nganasan tie a rope with a large, heavy knot at the end to one front leg, so that if it tries to run the rope will wind around its legs and bring it to a halt. 2. Cooperative Hunting in Small Groups These methods are of greater interest and of more economic importance. All involve driving the game, and require the use of a very important item of equipment, the makhavki, which is found nowhere else in Siberia. Makhavki are long poles with either the white wings of ptarmigan or long strips of black-colored leather danging from the top. When a herd of wild reindeer has been</page><page sequence="5">CHARD: THE NGANASAN: WILD REINDEER HUNTERS 109 located, these poles are stuck in the ground in two rows to form an expanding alley in the shape of a funnel. Then the most skilled hunter, driving a sled with a pair of deer, will round up the wild herd and chase them into the wide end of this alley, at which point a hunter stationed on each side would drive them further in by jumping up and down, shouting and waving garments. At the narrow end several other hunters will lie in wait- in the old days armed with bows, and sometimes even now- and shoot the animals as they go past at close range. If the wild herd is near a lake, the poles will be arranged in such a way as to drive the deer into the water. The hunters then lie in wait on the opposite shore in canoes, which they can transport wherever needed on the special sleds designed for the purpose. As soon as the animals are in the water, they push out and kill them with long spears. This latter method can be carried out successfully with the help of only a few men; even two can manage if necessary, one waiting on the opposite shore in a canoe while the other chases the deer in with the aid of dogs. Both of these methods are regarded as ancient ways among the Nganasan. A more recent development- one correlated with the increase in their herds and in their general prosperity- is the technique of driving wild deer into nets (Fig. 4). This is regarded as being an improvement over the older methods, although it is apparently only practised in early winter. It requires the hides of forty to fifty reindeer and a considerable amount of labor to manufacture such a net, the cords being braided of four thongs. Apparently this was beyond the resources of the Nganasan in their former im- poverished days. There is some reason for sup- posing that this method of hunting was known in the past to the Yukagir and perhaps the Tungus, although its actual use is recorded only for the Nganasan. Such net-hunting is feasible only in certain definite localities which are well known and are owned by particular clans. The net is set up to form a V at the foot of a rise or hillock on the tundra and is held vertically by three or four poles. An alley flanked by makhavki is then set up, formed by 25 to 35 poles on each side placed about 32 feet apart. This alley leads up over the opposite side of the rise or hillock and ends in the net, which is thus presumably hidden from the view of the oncoming deer until they are almost upon it. One or more beaters in sleds drawn by three reindeer round up a wild herd from the tun- dra and drive it to the vicinity of the alley where another beater takes over and heads the animals down the alley and up over the rise. Apparently as long as the herd can keep going straight ahead there is no inclination to turn aside through the rows of makhavki; but when they are finally con- fronted with the net they will of course try to avoid it. The last lap is therefore barricaded along the sides with sleds and dummies resembling people. At the crest of the rise two or three boys will be concealed, and as soon as the deer have passed over they will jump up and wave garments to pre- vent the quarry from turning back. An experienced hunter is also stationed by these barricades to shoot any deer who try to avoid the net. But the principal killers lie concealed behind piles of snow on both sides of the net; with short-handled spears and even knives they despatch the majority of the animals, whose antlers become entangled in the meshes. The owner of the net divides the bag in proportion to the number of persons in the family of each participant. 3. Large-scale Communal Hunts Large-scale communal hunts- or rather mass slaughters- at certain points on the autumn mi- gration when the deer are passing in huge herds, are the most important of all. This is of course an old aboriginal technique that is a mainstay elsewhere in the Far North, both in the Old and New Worlds. The locations for these slaughters are regarded as the property of a particular clan. These localities are safeguarded: hunting with firearms in the vicinity is prohibited, so as not to scatter the animals. Should any person fail to abide by this rule, and should the communal slaughter prove unsuccessful as a result, the group will compel the offender to make up the loss by slaughtering his own domestic herd. It is feasible to utilize these same localities year after year since the wild reindeer stick closely to a definite route. This method takes advantage of the natural movements of the animals: the hunters wait for the herd to come to them instead of going out after it; hence it is a method suitable for very primitive cultures lacking means of transportation which would make it possible to drive the quarry in. Therefore in the old days it was the chief re- liance of the Nganasan. The main object of this procedure is to get the deer in such a position that the hunters can get close enough to kill large num- bers rapidly without the animals being able to es- cape: close enough to despatch them directly with hand weapons, eliminating the uncertainties in- volved in shooting them. And the only way to do this under primitive conditions is to get them into the water in a place from which they cannot es- cape, and then kill them from canoes. An ideal</page><page sequence="6">110 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 location for this purpose is a small lake with high, steep banks on one side and a low, flat shore on the other. In order to steer the herd into such a lake, a barrier will be set up across their mi- gration route which forms one side of an alley leading down to the shallow lake shore. Both out- er ends of this alley will terminate at natural ob- stacles (e.g. bodies of water) so that the herd would not simply detour around the barrier. This alley will be over a mile long and is formed by poles about 4-1/2 feet high on which chunks of turf have been impaled to form a sort of pillar. When all is in readiness the people wait, often for several days, for the migrating herd to appear. An old experienced hunter is chosen as director, and strong young men who are also skilled canoe - men are selected as the actual killers. The lat- ter, with their boats, are concealed along the high shore of the lake opposite the inner end of the alley. Men are stationed at the outer ends of the barriers to keep the herd from turning back, and others at intervals along the alley to drive the deer into the lake by waving garments. Reindeer readily take to water as a means of escape when frightened or pursued, but in case any should turn and run back a marksman lies in wait at the base of the alley to shoot them down. As soon as the herd has reached the middle of the lake, the kill- ers, five or six in number, paddle quickly out and stab the animals with narrow iron spears up to 13 feet in length. In order not to spoil the hide, an effort is made to strike them in the hind end. In their terror, the creatures often will attack the canoes, and there is danger that they may upset the very unstable little craft with their forelegs. The hunters therefore back off after each killing. When all is over, the dead deer are towed ashore by a rope, several being fastened together by the neck. The bag from such a collective hunt is divided equally among all participants, and the families of the hunters assemble on the shore as soon as the slaughter is over and begin apportioning the carcasses. If there is a shortage of manpower, women would also participate and help to drive the deer down the alley. In former times the Nganasan say that so many animals were killed at these hunts that their skulls would be used instead of piles of turf on the poles forming the alley. Although reindeer hunting is the backbone of the economic system, other resources of the habi- tat are exploited also and make definite, if second- ary, contributions. Hunting the white polar fox has developed in response to the fur trade, and is the sole means by which the Nganasan obtain fire- arms, ammunition, metal and other items from the outside world. Foxes are shot with rifles in the fall, after having been run down with fast rein- deer until they are exhausted. In winter and spring, traps are set-nowadays mostly steel traps smeared with reindeer blood and attached to a bone or wooden anchor to prevent the animal from running off with the trap. (These anchors are pro- vided with protruding spikes and function precise- ly like a ship's anchor). The log deadfall is an- other recent introduction -in this case post-1917. In older times box-like deadfalls were constructed of stone slabs with a weighted pole for the fall. The meat of foxes is occasionally eaten. In early spring, when food is scarce, ptarmigan are taken with a special type of net made of white thread. These nets are 10 -15m long and half a meter high, and are set up with stakes. The ptarmigan are either driven into the net with great care or else are lured by fastening a female decoy nearby. At the beginning of summer the Nganasan start to hunt ducks: again, using special nets set up for this purpose in shallow water. Either they will tie a decoy duck in front of the net or place a number of pieces of turf upside down around it; from the air, these will be mistaken for sitting ducks. Or sometimes hunters on the shore will drive the birds into the net. Waterfowl are also hunted with firearms; however, they will only shoot at sitting birds and seem unable to bag them on the wing. In the old days, special arrows with forked heads were used for birds. The Nganasan will set steel traps right in a goose nest to catch the sitting bird- a practice apparently unique for Siberia. The eggs of various species are also used for food. The most important method of securing geese is the cooperative drive during the moulting season (beginning in late July) when the birds are unable to fly. A great effort is made to bag them as early in this period as possible, before they have lost their fat. These goose drives are there- fore the major occupation of the people at this particular time. Preparations are made well in advance- especially laying in a good supply of reindeer stomachs in which to store the goose fat. Goose meat forms a major part of the diet during this period, and is also dried in quantity for winter use. Geese resort to bodies of water and have to be driven ashore with canoes. If the flock is small, several men with dogs will hide along the shore and wait for them to reach land, where they are relatively helpless. This method is not too effective, however, since part of the quarry always manages to escape in the confusion. Net hunting is a much more efficient technique (Fig. 5). A long, V-shaped net is employed, stretched between</page><page sequence="7">CHARD: THE NGANASAN: WILD REINDEER HUNTERS 111 poles, with a square pen at the apex. This must be tightly staked to the ground along its entire length so that the birds will not be able to squeeze through underneath and thus make their escape. In order to extend the outer wings of this barri- cade still further, fish nets may be strung up. The arrangement will be set up near some lake where a large flock has been spotted. The birds will then be driven ashore with canoes and herded into the net by men concealed on either side. Once they are inside the square pen at the apex it is a simple matter to seize them and wring their necks. Such a drive will ordinarily bag several hundred geese, and catches of over a thousand are sometimes made. In the usual fashion, the hunters return to camp and let the women drive out and fetch back the bag, although they are care- ful first to cover the geese with the net in order to protect them from the omnipresent seagulls. Fishing is of major importance for only one of the three subdivisions of the Nganasan, which spends the summer in almost permanent camps on Lake Taimyr and its tributary streams, where an unusual abundance of fish is to be had. The principal catch consists of four speces of Core- ganus- the same ones upon which the Yukagir de- pend- and one species of Salmo. The other two Nganasan subdivisions prefer to concentrate on hunting and not to be tied down to any one place. They fish to a significant extent only in the spring when food is in short supply. Fishing is done partly with bone gorges: splinters of reindeer leg bone 10- 15cm long pointed at both ends, with the line fastened to the middle and the bait placed at one end. When the gorge is swallowed, it sticks crosswise in the gullet. In recent times regular- type fishhooks have also been made from bent nails. But most fish are taken with nets-woven preferably of horsehair, otherwise of thread: both of these materials, of course, being obtained from the outside world. These nets are 15-20m long and up to a meter and a half in width; they are made of different size mesh depending on the kind of fish they are to be used for. White nets are used during the bright weather of spring, and black ones in autumn under the ice; all are weight- ed with stones. Two or three such nets are sometimes fastened together and towed between two canoes like a seine. It is noteworthy that autumn fishing through the ice is done only with nets, not with spears as the Eskimo do. The Nganasan do not use fish spears at all- an unusual case among arctic peoples. Interestingly also, fishing is not done all winter long as a basis for subsistence, yet according to the classic theories of Hatt and Birket-Smith this is supposedly the only way in which people could exist in Siberia until they got snowshoes which would make hunting possible. (The Nganasan are virtually unique in this part of the world in their lack of any kind of skis or snowshoes). Fishing sites are apparently owned by clans, as are the localities for reindeer slaughters and for net hunting. The summer hunting territories may formerly have had some connection with the clan system, and perhaps membership in the summer hunting group was once restricted to kinsmen. With regard to the diet of the Nganasan, it has already been mentioned that reindeer and goose meat is sun-dried on sleds and stored for the winter. Fish is similarly processed and stored by those who catch it. Other birds and animals are eaten fresh on the spot, since they are not taken in quantity. Usually they are either some special delicacy (such as young wolves) or else game bagged at times of the year when food is scarce (e.g. ptarmigan and ducks) and hence needed im- mediately. All parts of the reindeer are eaten; the stomach contents seem to be the only vegetable food the Nganasan ever consume. Fresh fish are almost always eaten raw, although in cold weather (the only time when the majority of the people fish) it will at least be frozen. In the old days, the bow (Fig. 6) was the main weapon for hunting. For the past 100 years, how- ever, they have not manufactured bows themselves, preferring Ket or Yakut bows secured by trade- especially the latter, for which they will give a reindeer. The aboriginal Nganasan bow differed markedly from these trade types; it consisted of a mosaic of separate pieces of larch fastened to- gether, and considerable skill was required to make the result come out balanced and even so that it would function properly. A peculiar and dis- tinctive method of stringing was employed. There were quite a variety of arrow types for different purposes, including the forked forms for birds to which reference has been made. Even 100 years ago most of the arrowheads were made of iron. In recent years, the bow has been used only for birds and in the net hunts for reindeer; for all other purposes it has been replaced by a heterogenous assortment of antiquated firearms: flintlocks, rifles, fowling pieces, old army rifles and the like. But in spite of the fact that firearms are now the most vital item of equipment in their economy, the Nganasan take very poor care of them and often leave them out in the rain. Other weapons include the spears of various lengths for slaughtering deer already noted. And among the most important articles of hunting equipment nowadays are the nets of various kinds: for ptarmigan, for ducks,</page><page sequence="8">112 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 for geese, for fish and for reindeer- all of them different. In the old days when the Nganasan had few reindeer, the people say that their hunting paraphernalia were very rudimentary, being limited to bows, fish gorges and makhavki (the poles with streamers). Hunting with nets was a later innovation, according to them. Another important item of equipment that figures in the hunt is the canoe (Fig. 3). This is of the type referred to in Siberia as a vetka, and is used in goose and reindeer hunting as well as for fishing and crossing rivers. The vetka is a small, thin dugout that is light enough to be easily carried around. Since no materials for making such a craft exist in Nganasan territory, all of them must be acquired from neighboring peoples by trade. The Nganasan greatly prefer the Yakut type of vetka and will pay twenty times as much for one as for any other type; they are considered to be the best suited to local conditions. These are 4 -5m long and 75 cm wide, with a narrow plank sewn along the top of each side to increase the freeboard; they greatly resemble the Yukagir type and may well represent an ancient form in northern Siberia. These craft are propelled with double-bladed paddles. The Nganasan themselves regard wooden boats of any sort as a borrowed trait. The old people say that in former times their people made little use of the water, and that they had only skin boats which were so crude that they were reluctant to set out in any sort of wind, since these craft would buckle in the middle under the impact of even slight waves. Tools nowadays are of metal. The Nganasan do a limited amount of simple iron-working, using metal obtained through trade, but there are no specialized blacksmiths. The only dwelling used nowadays is the conical tipi (chum), a form widespread in Siberia (Figs. 8 and 9). But the old people say that their ancestors in earlier times lived in semi -subterranean dwellings along Lake Taimyr and its rivers. Two or three families would join forces in those days to construct a hut of driftwood and large stones covered over with turf. Stunted willows would be gathered in great quantities during the summer to serve as winter fuel. The modern tipi varies from 2-1/2 - 9m in di- ameter, depending on the number of occupants. The frame is composed of as many as sixty long poles, and is covered with reindeer skins. Two to five families will live in one such tipi, the in- terior being divided into equal parts for each family. Separate sleeping tents (Fig. 10) of rein- deer skins covering several persons are hung over the beds like mosquito nets -a practice very reminiscent of the Lapps and Yukagir. Clothing is made almost entirely from reindeer skins sewed with sinew. It is tailored from many small pieces, and highly decorative effects are achieved as a result. The Nganasan costume is very distinctive and differs markedly in appear- ance from that of neighboring peoples, with the ex- ception of the Enets (plural Entsy) or "Yenisei Samoyed." The most singular item of all is the footgear (Fig. 11), which is found nowhere else. It is a sort of cylindrical sheath, without an instep, with the result that the wearer's legs resemble those of an elephant. Men's boots are very high, and instead of trousers they wear two sets of shorts. Over the latter is worn a belt from which hang all sorts of equipment and to which the boot tops are fastened. The upper garment (Fig. 11) is a sort of parka made of different-colored skins with a tight-fitting hood. It is composed of two layers, with the fur side in on the inner layer and out on the outer. The inner layer is the longer, reaching down to the knees. This forms the house- hold costume. For travelling, a fur parka of very similar cut is worn over this; in summer the outer parka has the hair cut short and serves as a rain- coat. While sledding in winter, fut foot bags are used to keep the feet warm. The women's undergarment (Fig. 12) is a combination suit resembling somewhat an old- fashioned union suit. Five to seven crescent- shaped metal ornaments with stamped designs are sewn on the front of this, one above the other, while the legs have metal rings and tubes dangling from them. Women's boots are shorter than men's, coming a little above the knee, and the tops are tucked under the trouser legs of the combi- nation suit and very tightly fastened. The outer garment worn over this is cut open down the front (Fig. 13). Like the men's parka, it is also made of two layers with the inner one somewhat longer. (In summer, the outer layer is often removed). Instead of an attached hood like the men, women wear a cap shaped much like a separate hood. Since the outer garment is open down the front, women will don a second combination suit under- neath for winter travel; this lacks the metal orna- ments. They also wear an outer parka which again is open down the front and lacks the hood of the men's. Summer clothes are cut exactly like the winter ones. Small children wear a fur combination suit made with an opening in the rear (Fig. 14). Both sexes wear their hair in two braids,</page><page sequence="9">CHARD: THE NGANASAN: WILD REINDEER HUNTERS 113 parting it down the middle with a knife and smearing it with fat. Judging by traditions, the costume worn by the ancestral element who migrated north from the forest zone differed in many ways from the pres- ent dress, which the people say was borrowed from their neighbors the Enets. In the old days, we are told, the men's parka was cut like the women' s- i.e. it was open down the front. This indicates once again the presence of a southern element among the Nganasan- something we might expect in view of the evident Samoyed and Tungus influences in the culture and language. (Clothing open down the front is typical of the entire forest zone of Siberia- best exemplified by the Tungus, but also occurring in the Altai-Sayan area which is regarded as the Samoyed homeland). Pull- over type parkas without opening are, on the other hand, found in Siberia only among the tundra peoples: the Chukchi, Koryak and Eskimo in the east, and the Enets and Nenets to the west of the Nganasan. Quite obviously, therefore, the parka is the ancient costume of the aboriginal inhabi- tants of the tundra who were submerged by south- ern invaders. Our knowledge of the non-material aspects of Nganasan culture is unfortunately scanty and un- satisfactory and permits only a summary outline (based on Levin and Potapov 1956: 653-57). This portion of Popov's monograph remained unpub- lished at his death in 1960. There are three sub-divisions of the Nganasan: the Avam (5 clans), the Vadeev (6 clans), and the separate clan Oko of Dolgan origin. Of these, the Avam group consider themselves to represent the most "genuine" Nganasan- the others being of foreign origin and more recently acculturated. The clans are exogamous units which retain clan idols but otherwise have no territorial or eco- nomic identity. Nganasan communities are made up of families belonging to different clans and united only by ties of proximity. The composition of these communities varies. Sometimes they represent working associations, e.g. for hunting; more often they are composed of poor families who have grouped themselves around the house- hold of a wealthy reindeer owner and have become dependant upon him economically. Wealth dis- tinctions are rather clearly delineated, and are based chiefly on unequal distribution of domestic reindeer. We are told that 11% of the families owned 60% of the deer, and that the lower 66% of families together owned only 17%. The latter often had to rent deer from wealthier neighbors, the going rate being one polar fox skin per annum, which was reckoned as being worth five pre- revolutionary rubles ($2.58 in pre-1914 U. S. dollars). Hunters are expected to provide for the neigh- bors out of their bag, and disputes often arose out of these mutual obligations. Such disputes are settled by the old men at meetings convened in the spring and fall. Should a neighbor complain that he had been forced to slaughter one of his domestic deer to avoid starvation because a hunter had failed to share his bag, then the latter would be required to compensate for the value of the deer- unless he could prove that the neighbor had previ- ously failed to render him comparable assistance. According to another related custom, a hunter kill- ing a wild reindeer would give the rear half and the hide to a neighbor. In such cases, he leaves the carcass where it fell, and the recipient of the gift fetches it in and turns the front half over to the hunter. In the realm of marriage practices, we find polygyny, the levirate, child marriage and the bride price. Marriage often takes the form of ex- changing sisters. Should the bridegroom's father be insolvent, his kinsmen will help pay the bride price, for which they must subsequently receive deer from the bride's dowry in compensation. The father is the boss of the family in every sense. At the first signs of pregnancy, a woman is sub- jected to various restrictions and is regarded as unclean. Birth takes place, however, in the dwell- ing. The newborn is washed with water from the mouths of the grandmothers (who perhaps serve as midwives?) and is fumigated with burning dog hair (note that reindeer hair is not used for this ritual purpose, suggesting that the dog has an older place in Nganasan culture). For three days after the birth a purification ceremony is carried out: the fat of wild reindeer is placed in a red-hot fry- ing pan and all the persons residing in the tipi hold their hands over the smoke. There is no hurry about naming a child, and it is not uncommon to meet two- or three -year olds who still have no names. Names are assigned by older members of the family. They either serve the function of pro- tecting against evil spirits or are associated with some specific event. For example, a child may be named "Glad" or "Joyful" because four wild deer were bagged on the day of his birth. The kinship system is classificatory, as among the Nenets (Yurak Samoyed). Marriage is for- bidden with members of the mother's clan as well as within the paternal lineage. There is a strict division of labor within the family. The women erect and dismantle the tipi,</page><page sequence="10">114 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 prepare skins, sew, braid cordage from sinew, prepare food and look after the children. The men hunt, fish, herd reindeer, do the wood- working and braid leather lassos. (Women herd only during the autumn hunting season or other occasions when all the menfolk are absent). Nganasan religious beliefs may be character- ized as animistic. Even objects used by man are considered to be alive and to understand human speech. When the sleds containing winter equip- ment are left behind at the winter camp, the people make a little speech to them and promise them fat and meat in the autumn. In spring, rein- deer are brought as sacrifices to certain rivers. In the fall, deer or dogs are sacrificed to the spirits of certain sacred hillocks. Supernatural beings fall into three main cate- gories: 1) owners of natural phenomena and of different categories of things (e.g. sky, sun, ground, fire, reindeer, hunger, smallpox- the latter being regarded as especially powerful); 2) anthropomorphic beings harmful to man, which especially inhabit water (rivers, lakes, the sea); 3) special spirits, usually zoomorphic, who serve shamans. Material objects regarded as family guardians are called kuoika.* Sometimes these are stones, antlers or other objects of unusual form which have attracted attention. In other cases they are zoomorphic or anthropomorphic figures made of metal or wood. These kuoika travel in special sleds drawn by sacred reindeer which are dis- tinguished by their distinctive brands. They are fumigated each month with wild reindeer fat, and are also fed after a successful hunt by placing pieces of fat and meat of the wild deer in their sled. It is more correct to regard the kuoika as * spirit placings" or dwelling places for minor supernatural beings who take up residence therein through the intervention of the shaman. Although the kuoika brought advantages to men, they did so from entirely selfish motives and expected a re- ward for even the smallest service. If not proper- ly treated they could cause serious trouble and might even become a burden to their owners, who must go to considerable inconvenience to avoid the possibility of offending them. Natural features that are regarded as sacred are also called kuoika: hillocks, cliffs, trees of unusual form, and so forth. Offerings of sacri- ficial reindeer, shreds of cloth strung on cords, money, etc. are made to them. Shamanism is strongly developed among the Nganasan. The shaman's costume is distinguished *See paper by A. A. Popov in this issue. by a wealth of pendants. Many shamans had two or three costumes and several drums (Fig. 7) for different occasions. Their outfit consisted of a headdress, a cloak with a separate apron, and boots- or sometimes a combination suit like a woman's. The principal religious ceremonies were the festival of the " purified tipi" and the rite of pas- sage through the "stone gates. " The former was held in February when the sun reappeared after the mid-winter darkness. At this time a special tipi was constructed in which the shaman held forth from morning till evening over a period of three to nine days, entreating the deities for the welfare of the whole people during the coming year. While this is going on, the young people engage in dancing and games outside the tipl. Sometimes this cere- mony is replaced by the rite of passage through the stone gates. For this purpose they construct a sort of tunnel of stone slabs. The shaman carries on for three days, after which he and all those present pass through these gates three times. There is belief in the transmigration of souls. After death a man continues to live in the under- world a life similar to that on earth, but his soul returns to the owner of souls and is subsequently resettled in a newborn child. The dead are not buried in winter but are placed on a sled. In the scrub forest they erect a conical structure of hewn logs over this sled. A woman's dowry is placed on her grave. Nganasan folklore is diverse and rich. The principal forms are metrical epics, tales, histori- cal traditions, songs and riddles. The epics are very lengthy, sometimes requiring several eve- nings for their recitation. Historical traditions are numerous and reflect the past conflicts of the Nganasan, chiefly with the Nenets and Tungus. Oratory and eloquence are highly regarded. In the old days there were verbal duels between persons with special talents along these lines. There are no musical instruments of any sort- ii we except the shaman's drum. Decorative art is represented by engraving on mammoth ivory, the inlaying and stamping of metal, coloring skins and decorative sewing with fur mosaics or reindeer hair. Ornamental designs are exclusively geometric: the representation of living creatures or beings is permitted only on cult objects. The greatest variety of decoration is found in the engraving of the small ivory plates on the reindeer halters, with red and black pigment inserted in the grooves. Iron is inlayed with copper and silver. The sheet copper ornaments adorning the front of the women's garment are decorated by stamping designs with iron stamps.</page><page sequence="11">CHARD: THE NGANASAN: WILD REINDEER HUNTERS 115 Skins are decorated with the use of wooden stamps, or paint- red ochre and black graphite- is applied with a stick. Sculpture is confined to the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic cult objects. The origins and process of formation of the present-day Nganasan are of considerable inter- est because they have been traced in some detail through ethnohistorical investigations (Dolgikh 1962) and present a rather startling picture of the heterogeneous recent background of a culturally and linguistically homogeneous people. It brings home to us how constantly shifting is the ethnic map of Siberia, how continuous the processes of cultural and linguistic change. We may wonder how many other such distinctive cultures and peoples have arisen, existed and vanished in the un-recorded past. Of the three Nganasan subdivisions, the sepa- rate Oko clan stems from a Dolgan family and was founded in the early 19th century. It subse- quently became assimilated and acculturated. The Vadeev tribe of Nganasan are Samoyedized Tun- gus- the process taking place in the second half of the 18th century. The Avam tribe was origi- nally (i.e. in the early 17th century) composed of two groups of Samoyedized tundra aborigines and three groups of Tungus- one of the latter migrat- ing in from the south, the other two from the east or southeast of the present Nganasan territory. These Tungus groups may actually have repre- sented Tungusized Palaeo-Asiatics- most proba- bly Yukagir, who are thought to have been the ancient population of the tundra from Taimyr to the Chukchi Peninsula. (Many cultural parallels have been noted between the Yukagir and Ngana- san). In this connection it is also significant that the Nganasan feel no kinship whatever with the modern or recent Tungus. The present-day Nganasan are thus a combination of the north- easternmost Samoyed (or Samoyedized tundra population) and the northwester nmost Tungus (or Tungusized) groups. The exact origin of the for- mer is bound up with the origin of the Enets, who represent an identical situation; the question is still undergoing study. At any rate, it is evident that the Nganasan in pre -Russian times (prior to the 17th century) were not yet Samoyed. Basi- cally, they are descendants of the ancient Palaeo- Asiatic population of northern Asia, who were Neolithic hunters of wild reindeer. Ethnically, this ancient population probably represented the western periphery of the territory occupied by the Yukagir. " From a wider point of view, the formation of the Nganasan people came as a concluding stage of a movement to the extreme north of central Siberia of peoples of the Uralic and Altaic language groups- Samoyeds to the west of the Yenisei and Tungus to the east of it. Both the Tungus and the Samoyeds influenced the ancestors of the Ngana- san- the Neolithic Palaeo -Asiatic population of the Taimyr, the Khatanga, and the Anabar- but final dominance was achieved by the Samoyed language, which prevailed over the Palaeo -Asiatic Yukagir as well as the Tungus languages. In the same way, the Samoyed economic system, Samoyed material culture, and social organization in general sup- planted not only those of the Yukagir hunters but also those of the Tungus. Nevertheless, the cul- ture of the Neolithic Palaeo -Asiatic hunters, the Yukagirs, survived among the Nganasan in the form of relicts and ethnographic peculiarities to a greater degree than with other peoples to the west of the Lena, with the exception of the Enets.
