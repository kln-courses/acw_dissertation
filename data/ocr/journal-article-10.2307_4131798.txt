<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leora Batnitzky. Idolatry and Representation: The Philosophy of Franz Rosen- zweig Reconsidered. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000. x, 281 pp. This is a fantastic book, certain to stimulate many debates, and not just about its subject, Franz Rosenzweig. At the heart of Batnitzky's text is an argument about religious truth and the form it takes in the modern world, about "idolatry" and "rep- resentation." As understood by the author, the law against idolatry did not mean for Rosenzweig what it meant for Maimonides and Hermann Cohen; it does not reflect the epistemological conundra that go into the presentation of a God who outstrips all sensual image and mental representation. Instead, Batnitzky takes idolatry to mean the act of fixing upon one single image, thereby limiting God's freedom to appear in different forms. In this light, the term representation gets pulled away from the German Vorstellung (i.e. with the presentation of an abstract truth) and aligned with the verb vertreten (suggesting how one represents that truth through one's very being, one's own physical existence and image). Batnitzky situates Rosenzweig-but perhaps more importantly, the larger German-Jewish tradition of ethical monotheism-within an expanded field that includes art and politics. Some readers may want to quibble with this or that de- tail, with the author's portrait of Rosenzweig, or with her understanding of poli- tics and modern art. However, Batnitzky has gotten Rosenzweig so right in so many ways that it hardly matters that the problem of idolatry did not directly exercise him nearly as much as it does her. Idolatry and Representation persuasively high- lights the importance of carnality, community, and the harsh and dissonant judg- ments that these entail in Rosenzweig's work. Great bracing tonic, this image of Rosenzweig will advance not just Rosenzweig scholarship but also the very types of argument upon which the larger project of contemporary Jewish thought de- pends. It does so, in large part, by combining the insight of two recent voices in contemporary religious thought: the post-liberal Protestant theologian George Lindbeck and the modern orthodox Michael Wyschogrod. The emphasis on community demonstrates Batnitzky's affinity with Lind- beck, the author of Nature of Doctrine-who has sought to move Protestant the- ology away from individual experience and its expression and towards the cultur- 165</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews al and linguistic types of thought made possible by community. Lindbeck is the unnamed presence supporting an argument regarding the logical and axiological priority of community that dominates Chapters Three and Five of Batnitzky's text. She insists that, in Rosenzweig's thought, individual experience "can only be un- derstood" from the perspective of community (p. 64); that structures of commu- nity are "epistemologically privileged" over experience (p. 67). Reading The Star of Redemption backwards, Batnitzky argues that the intense expression of revela- tion and redemption in part two of Rosenzweig's text is "only possible" and "only because" of the Jewish and Christian communities described in part three (p. 71). It is a bold claim with a lot of merit, but it is one-sided. After all, the argument that one cannot think or value "I" without already presupposing "you/he/she/it/we/ they" works both ways simultaneously. For my part, I think it makes more sense to argue that, logically and axiologically, the community and the individual are al- ways already co-present, neither one before the other, but all at once. This yields a more tensed dynamic that I think comes much closer to the one that Rosenzweig shared with Buber-who has been turned into the romantic and individualistic an- tipode of a Rosenzweig made to look too much like ... George Lindbeck. In my view, the book's far greater contribution lies in the way it supports the claim that truth is embedded. This idea resonates with those expressed by Michael Wyschogrod in Body of Faith-a book dedicated to the carnality of Jewish life and thought, to a deeply embodied Jewish people, its land and cult, and a person- al God who comes quite close to assuming corporeal dimension. In Batnitzky's view, Rosenzweig's thought assumes the same fleshy presence. As she reads him, an expansive carnal field mediates truth. This field takes shape qua Jewish being, calendar-life, blood community (sexual procreation?), scriptural word-forms, the act of translation, and the image of God. The revelation of truth runs the gamut from ethics, art, and politics-parts one, two, and three of Batnitzky's text. The very structure of Idolatry and Representation should clearly generate great con- versation. Should ethics assume that privileged center point around which pivot art and politics? Or does she want to have ethics depend upon art-which turns in turn around politics? Or does she intend to hold all three points together at the same time, without privileging one or the others? Those at least are some of the ques- tions that I would ask. Delighting in the author's lead, one reads Batnitzky's book back in reverse- order to get a sense of how it all moves: Politics: In the conclusion and in Chapter Eight respectively, Batnitzky con- siders "the future of monotheism" and Rosenzweig's thought in light of American pluralism, the memory of the Holocaust, and the creation of the State of Israel. Chapter Seven looks to the challenge and risks involved in maintaining a separate Jewish identity in the Diaspora. Chapter 6 goes against the easy ecumenism that often attends the Rosenzweig scholarship. The dialogue between Jews and Chris- tians requires asymmetry and judgment, not mutuality and tolerance, in order to preserve the difference. Art: Chapter Five shows how Rosenzweig sought to maintain that Jewish dif- ference in his Bible-translation work, retaining the particular nuance of Hebrew language in order to sustain the shock and abiding strangeness of God's word. 166</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Chapter Four lays out the idea of the Jewish uncanny, one suggested by Susan Shapiro. In this view, the Jewish people as understood by Rosenzweig resembles a modern work of art: uncanny, self-contained, and other; itself an embodied sign. Ethics: Chapter Three picks up Daniel Boyarin's phrase "carnal Israel" in or- der to advance a strong image of Jewish and Christian community, one that insists upon the logical and axiological priority of its structure over against the individ- ual subject. In Chapter Two, this carnal sign reorients the modern person vis-a-vis the past, opening humanity to those communal and historical structures which alone provide "meaning" in the modern world. In Chapter One, the author per- suasively defends the philosophical coherence of biblical anthropomorphism, the image of God meeting with a carnal person imbedded within community. Full of verve, broad in reach and consequence, analytically sharp, and clear- ly written, this fresh and important reading of Rosenzweig is a must-read text for those who want to work modern and contemporary Jewish thought and philoso- phy of religion around community, the uncanny, and other embodied signs.
