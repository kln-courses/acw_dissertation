Kress Collection. 58</page><page sequence="2">Gossart, Italy, and the National Gallery's Saint Jerome Penitent Sadja Herzog The painter Jan Gossart,1 called Mabuse (c. 1478- 1532) occupies a key position in the history of Flemish painting largely because in the early months of 1509 he sojourned in Italy, where he made studies of ancient Roman artifacts. His voyage to the south anticipated the wave of study pilgrimages that many artists somewhat later in the century felt were necessary for proper ground- ing in their art. Gossarťs mythological subjects and nudes formerly were cited as evidence that this trip had exercised an immense and immediate influence over his style. More recently, scholars disclosed that there was no obvious cause and effect relationship between Gossart's trip to Italy and his subsequent stylistic evolution. In the words of M. J. Friedländer: "What he brought from the south he used late, without consequence and superficially. Had Gossart with a blow around 1508 profoundly changed his taste and style through his visual experiences, the effect of Italian models would have been most obviously apparent in works he created immediately following his trip. This, however, is not the case." 2 Friedländer s widely accepted assessment of Gossarťs experiences in Italy reflects the method of art historians active between the two great wars. During this time, it was of paramount importance to assemble the oeuvres of painters, to establish the chronology of their works, and to point out how the chain of formal influences passed from one artist to the next. This approach has been relegated to second place only recently in favor of other methods of investigation. An appreciation of Gossart, furthermore, was set back by the prejudiced tastes of nineteen th- and twentieth-century scholars whose critical apparatus was formed by an Italianate and classi- Sadja Herzog is Assistant Professor of Art History at The Ohio State University. 59 cizing bias. Viewed through their eyes, Gossarťs attempts to assimilate southern achievements must have inevitably looked grotesque or, at best, bizarre.3 It is only when we view the man from a vantage essentially his own that he strikes us as one of the genuinely creative spirits of his time. The critical period of Gossarťs formation in Antwerp, his experience in Italy, and his subse- quent activity are poorly known. The documents are not very informative. In addition, what we know of Gossarťs style indicates that his manner evolved rapidly and radically during his first decade (1503-1513) as a master. In the following paragraphs we shall review Friedländer's evaluation of the impact of Italy and its monuments on Gossart in connection with the pair of altar wings depicting St. Jerome Penitent ( Fig. 1 ) in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C.4 The St. Jerome Penitent is one of two known 5 early works by Gossart that clearly reveal the painter's style as we see it in his later signed works. The other works, presumed to be of a still earlier period but uncontested because of signa- tures, are all drawings 6 that display a style almost unrecognizable as Gossarťs, if the later works are taken as exemplars of his manner. The St. Jerome Penitent, therefore, is a pivotal work linking the early drawings to the later oeuvre. We shall want to know when Gossart executed it, and what it tells us about the process by which Gossart arrived at his personal, clearly distinguishable style of the late teens. The St. Jerome Penitent first came to the attention of scholars through Friedländer's reproduction of the work in 1930.7 Fifteen years later it was once again published by Glück; he obtained his photograph from a New York dealer.8 Both authors knew of the painting as a single unit, and to judge from their reproductions, the two parts</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2.

William Suida informs us that after the Samuel H. Kress Founda- tion acquired the St. Jerome Penitent in 1949, the painting was cleaned by Mario Modestini, who discovered that it was made up of two parts (Fig. 2), that the landscape was definitely discontinuous, and that a frame of some sort was intended to take up the gap.9 The two halves, furthermore, were already cradled and the edges along the joint were trimmed several centimeters. Mr. Modestini separated the panels, recradled each separately and added a narrow strip of wood along the trimmed edges in order to frame the panels. The paint losses visible in Figure 2 appear disheartening at first glance, but on second appraisal, they are neither especially numerous for a work of this type, nor do they occur in areas of primary importance. The St. Jerome Penitent is painted in grisaille on two vertical panels. The saint with his com- panion, the lion, occupies the right leaf; the left is dominated by a crucifix nesfled in the branches of a dead tree. A rocky landscape containing buildings, sparse vegetation, and secondary 61 representations of Jerome, the lion, and a camel caravan, stretches across both panels. The middle- aged, beardless, and slightly balding saint is shown bent down on one knee and striking his breast with one of two sharp stones which he holds in his hands. He wears an ankle-length robe, held in place about the waist by a thorn girdle woven around a piece of cord.10 His sleeveless garment is open in the front down to the waist, exposing St. Jerome's hard, knotty chest and arms. A cardinal's hat lies at his side, and behind him crouches the lion with an alert expression on its face. A gnarled tree, ripped open above the roots as though by an explosion, rises up before Jerome. The tau-shaped crucifix ( Fig. 3 ) , set at an angle to the picture plane, seems to grow up out of the wound in the tree's trunk. Christ's anatomy is schematically rendered; it is expressive, rather than accurate. Pained grimaces twist the features of both figures. Christ wears a large crown of thorns, and He is shown beardless. A heavy robe lies piled on the ground behind the tree. Jagged rock formations and prominent lifeless vegetation underscore the desolation of the saint's habitat.11 The grisaille color scheme conveys an ascetic mood. The coloration, however, is far from monotonous or monochromatic. The gray tonalities range over a wide scale in highlighted and shaded areas, and they are enriched by the subtle introduction of color. A layer of red bole beneath the surface pigments is visible in portions of the sky and landscape,12 and highlighted passages were probably originally finished with a lemon yellow glaze most visible in the figure of St. Jerome.13 The paint layers are quite thin, allowing the underpainting to show through in some areas, notably the contour of Jerome's right arm and the back of his head. While the draftsmanship is occasionally awkward (as in the foreshortening of Jerome's features, and in the relationship of the saint's hip and legs to the drapery ) , the painting reveals passages of great technical virtuosity. The lighting effects around the base of the tree and the definition of bark and wood grain textures, for instance, are masterfully rendered, and throughout the painting the finishing touches are applied with deft flicks and flourishes of the brush. The display of com- plexly manipulated pigments and subtly orches- trated coloristic effects bear witness to Gossart's reputation as a consummate craftsman.14 Today scholars unanimously agree that the St. Jerome Penitent is a characteristic work by</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4.

In former times, however, other authors were suggested. There is a small stone plaque propped up against the hillside beneath the mon- astery at a level with Jerome's ear which bears a Dürer monogram. This detail viewed in raking light clearly shows up as a later addition. Precisely why and when the plaque was added is unknown; it reflects the belief of another age, and may have influenced subsequent attribution of the composi- tion to another famous German painter, Hans Holbein the Younger.16 Although the authorship of the St. Jerome Penitent appears certain, there remains some disagreement as to its date. M. J. Friedländer first published the work almost forty years ago.17 He knew it from a photograph only, and before its restoration; he cautiously ventured the date c. 1512. Gustav Glück, using as his point of departure the curiously anthropomorphic lion, argued that the panels must have been executed just prior to Gossarťs trip to Italy in 1509.18 His point seems well taken. We know that Gossart made fairly accurate sketches of lions' heads copied from ancient Roman statuary.19 Although both scholars disagree on the date by a matter of less than half a decade, the precise dating of the panels is a matter of some impor- tance for two reasons: because Gossarťs journey through Italy falls between the suggested dates and because the chronology of Gossarťs entire pre-Italian oeuvre is very uncertain and partly dependent on the dating of the St. Jerome. The problem here touched upon lies beyond the scope of this paper; however, one or two observations seem necessary. Glück's comment about the lion is less pertinent than he imagined. He assumed that Gossart consistently applied what he saw or learned in Italy to the works he subsequently executed. This was not the case. The St. Luke Portraying the Virgin in Prague, which certainly dates later than Gossarťs trip to Italy, includes the figure of a bronze Hercules which is not patterned after any Roman or Italian model.20 We can best clarify the chronological position of the St. Jerome Penitent in Gossarťs oeuvre by comparing it to his Roman drawings,21 the earliest securely datable works from the artist's hand.22 The Roman sheets consist of three figure studies and one sketch of the Colosseum. The style of all four drawings bear on the grisaille panels. They provide the earliest proof of Gossarťs interest in roundly modeled forms rendered through a skillful manipulation of lighting effects; simple objects have a sculptural quality, while highly articulated areas tend to appear more flattened because Gossart experienced difficulty in coping with their complexity. The anatomy of the figures sometimes appears awkward or only partially understood. Finally, Gossarťs drawing technique is dexterous. These observations also apply to the St. Jerome Penitent. Gossarťs presumed earlier works 23 lack the skill evident in the altar wings; his slightly later works 24 indicate that he successfully eliminated the crudities still characteristic of his Roman period. In short, the St. Jerome fits comfortably into the oeuvre if it is placed in chronological proximity to his Roman drawings. But since the medium of the works is different, and since there is hardly any completely reliable comparative material, the altar wings cannot be dated any closer than c. 1507/08 to c. 1510/12. For the moment we are forced to work within the chronological boundaries proposed by Friedländer and Glück. Stylistic analysis proves to be an inadequate tool for further refinement of the work's date. We shall return to this problem again. William Suida was the first to observe that the measurements of the Jerome panels are similar to those of Gossarťs generally acknowledged early Agony in the Garden (Fig. 6) in Berlin-Dahlem.25 The vertical dimension of both is the same, and the combined width of the Jerome wings is only 12 cms. (c. 4% inches) narrower than the breadth of the Berlin painting (presumably a frame would have accounted for the difference) . Suida suggested that the Berlin panel may have been the center of a triptych with the Jerome grisaille as the outer faces of its wings. The figure style, jagged rock formations, and bravura handling of lighting effects in both works cer- tainly draws them together. Both panels are united, furthermore, by the theme of prayer, and in both Christ is shown beardless - possibly for the first time since the early Christian era. St. Jerome's shaven features, it would seem, were intended by Gossart to harmonize with Christ's. Suidas proposal is not without its difficulties. The juxtaposition of the two scenes, though thematically appropriate, is without precedent. Also, the depiction of a landscape intended to be 64</page><page sequence="8">Figure 6.

Johnson Collection, Philadelphia. 66</page><page sequence="10">understood as a real landscape in a grisaille is very rare, if not unknown, in both fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Flemish painting - in this respect, Gossart's composition is a genuine vanguard achievement.26 His only other known, possibly comparable (because it was scenic) grisaille was a lost Beheading of St. James described by Karel van Mander;27 it seems to have been created as an independent art work. In small altarpieces, furthermore, it was often the custom to omit the dividing frame when a continuous space was depicted. Gossart's Malvagna Triptych illustrates this usage 28 We might ordinarily expect, therefore, no dividing frame for the St. Jerome , or at least a narrower one than suggested by Suida's hypothesis. The panels were, as observed above, somewhat broader than they are today. The closeness of the lion's head to one trimmed edge, and the cut-off portion of the ass's nose indicate that at least one or two centimeters were shaved away from each panel; even so, the dividing frame implied by Suida would have been exceptionally wide. Despite these difficulties, the St. Jerome Penitent was obviously composed of two sections, and it must have functioned as altar wings, reliquary shutters, or something of that sort. Gossart's portrayal of Jerome illustrates an aspect of the saint's life that was rarely depicted in painting before the sixteenth century.29 Jan van Eyck30 and Rogier van der Weyden31 had invented a Hieronymic iconography that enjoyed tremendous popularity throughout Europe. The Eyckian Jerome showed the saint in his study, following the tradition of Evange- list portraits. Rogier depicted the saint seated extracting the thorn from the lion's paw and surrounded by a landscape. Both types stressed the contemplative or kindly side of the saint's life. The penitent St. Jerome, though included in the Rogierian panel in Detroit as a small scene in the background,32 attained popularity only dur- ing the second half of the fifteenth century in Italy. North Italian models in turn inspired Dürers St. Jerome Penitent (B.6) of about 1497. According to Panofsky,33 Dürers print is a rare instance of the theme in German art (known in only a few scattered woodcuts) , which up to that time had adhered to the Eyckian and Rogierian tradition. Examples of the new iconography in Flemish34 painting appear shortly after 1500 in the works of painters active in Bruges 35 and Louvain 36 - and Antwerp, if Gossart's painting antedates his trip to Italy. Dürers engraving, the North Italian, and the Flemish renderings of the 67 theme are formally unrelated, and if a chain of transmission from one group to the next ever existed, it does not seem possible to retrace it from the known examples. Many Flemish penitent St. Jeromes conform to the same basic scheme (e.g., Figs. 7 and 8). Jerome is shown at the right, kneeling and facing the crucifix at the left. He is set into a landscape which sometimes includes the camel caravan noted in Gossart's painting. This detail and other background accessories were most certainly inspired by the life of the saint recounted in the Legenda aurea. There is no common denominator for such details as the saint's clothing, the type or pose of the lion, the size and placement of the crucifix, or the landscape. At least four panels plus Gossart's, however, show Jerome clean shaven.37 Representations of St. Jerome without a beard are numerous.38 Almost all of these show the saint as a scholar in his study, a churchman, patron saint, or ministering to the lion. When Jerome is portrayed living in the wilderness or engaged in penance, his renunciation of physical comforts and personal vanity are underscored by his unkempt appearance and unshaven features.39 Instances to the contrary are rare,40 and there seems to be no ready explanation for this iconographical anomaly, except possibly in the case of Gossart's painting (see above). Gossart's St. J eroìne Penitent differs from Flemish depictions of the theme in the way in which he shows the crucifix as very large and forming a unit with, or growing out from, a dead tree. Other Flemish painters treat the crucifix as a real object, either nailed to a nearby tree as in Figure 7, or inserted into a mound in the hillside and supported by stones piled around the base of the cross as in Figure 8. Furthermore, it is always shown as a small, portable object. A number of Italian painters rendered the crucifix in their portrayals of the penitent St. Jerome in ways which are consistent with the meaning of this detail in Gossart's panel. The closest Italian parallel to Gossart's depiction of the crucifix is in the work of Lazzaro Bastiani (Venetian, c. 1430-1512) 41 who placed the crucifix against a withered tree. Nicola di Maestro Antonio d'Ancona (Marchigian, act. late fifteenth-early sixteenth centuries)42 showed a thin crucifix growing out of a tree stump which is dry at the roots and verdant near the base of the cross. Filippo da Verona (Venetian, act.</page><page sequence="11">end of fifteenth-early sixteenth centuries)43 separated the crucifix from the tree. In his paint- ing, Jerome holds a small crucifix, while a small tree stump rises up in the center of a flat area in front of the saint. A goldfinch perches on the tiny, budding branches near the top of the stump.44 Bartolomeo di Giovanni (Florentine, act. late fifteenth century - c. 1510?) inserted the crucifix into the earth close to the foreground; St. Jerome kneels nearby and faces towards the viewer.45 Rising up directly behind the saint is a prominent hill; on its crest grow two trees - one leafy, the other barren. Finally, we should note two somewhat later treatments of the theme, one by Fra Bartolommeo46 and the other by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio;47 the former showed the crucifix nailed to a dead tree; the latter enlarged the scale of the crucifix and leaned it against the leafy boughs of a partially trimmed tree. Gossart and the Italian painters named above all show the crucifix with a leafy and /or desiccated tree. The verdant and dry trees clearly refer to the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge (of good and evil) . When Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, the couple lost their immortality and caused the tree to shrivel up and die. From early Christian times onwards, Christ was characterized as the reviver of the Tree of Knowledge, the issue of the Tree of Life and identical to it. In his Exposito super septem visiones libri Apocalypsis, St. Ambrose specified the idea: "The Tree of Life in the middle of Paradise is Christ in the middle of His Church."48 Medieval writers created a complex literature out of this image,49 fusing the ger- minal statements about the two trees in Eden in Genesis 2 : 9 and Luke 23:31 (on the road to Calvary Christ says, "For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?") , to an exposition of the genealogy of Christ ( the Tree of Jesse) , and the association of the True Cross with the Tree of Knowledge. The vastness of the literature, Judaic as well as Christian, devoted to, or touching upon the image of the tree reflects the degree to which the theme fired the imagination of medieval writers. Rabbinic tradition records that a part of the tree in Eden - in some accounts a branch, in others three seeds - was planted over Adam's grave and sprouted three days later.50 The new tree, its seeds, or branches formed into rods passed successively from Enoch to Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The rod was taken from Joseph by Pharaoh and planted in the garden of Jethro, 68 where Moses found it. The Legenda aurea says simply that Moses discovered the rod undisturbed over Adam's grave; it had grown into a tree of triple form, having branches of cypress, cedar, and pine. Moses took up the three parts, and made the rod with which he performed the mir- acles credited to him. Before Moses died, he planted the rod at the foot of Mount Tabor, where David found it. David brought the holy wood to Jerusalem and planted it near the future site of Solomon's temple. The tree which sprang up shaded David when he composed the Psalms. Solomon honored the tree, which he had girded by a silver band each year for thirty years during the construction of the temple. The carpenters of the temple reported to Solomon that they required a gigantic beam in order to carry on with their work. No other tree but that in front of the temple was large enough for their needs. Solomon instructed that the tree be felled, and that the silver bands be placed in the temple. The bands from the tree later became the thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas for his betrayal. The wood of the tree proved to be unsuitable for the temple, and the great beam made from it was cast aside and used instead as a bridge over a stream. When the Queen of Sheba came to Jersusalem, she honored the tree and prophesied that the savior of the world would be hung upon it. As a consequence, the beam was buried deep in the ground on a spot later excavated and made into a pool that was said to have healing powers. The beam remained submerged until the time of Christ's Passion, when it floated to the surface of the waters, and was made into the Cross of the Lord. The Cursor Mundi records that during the day of the Crucifixion the cross burst into leaf once again and withered at sundown. The story of the tree recommences with St. Helena's finding of the True Cross, the theft by Chosroes of the portion remaining in Jerusalem, and its restoration by Heraclius. The image of the dry tree, finally, remained fixed in the minds of Christians until the decline of the medieval tradition in the post- Renaissance period. In Gossart's day the image of the lignum vitae still thrived, as indicated by the publication in 1503 of Hrabanus Maurus' treatise in praise of the Holy Cross,51 which dwells in elaborate form on the associations already amply expounded by the Church Fathers. In both the Judaic and Christian traditions, the meaning to be drawn from the story is the same: the tree is a cosmic symbol, it served as an instrument of salvation, the element of reju- venation is central to the narrative, and it is</page><page sequence="12">Figure 8. Albert Bouts, St. Jerome Penitent. Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels (Photo A.C.L., Brussels) . 69</page><page sequence="13">the vehicle for the portrayal of the antithesis of death and life. In the words of St. Augustine, "In the tree we perish, in the tree we are redeemed; in the wood hangs death, in the wood hangs life."52 Gossart's depiction of the withered tree with the crucifix growing out of its heart wood is a very explicit, concise statement of the concept centered in the Tree of Life. The inclusion of this detail in representations of the penitent St. Jerome is especially appropriate. The saint sought spiritual renewal through imitation of Christ's physical and spiritual suffering, which began with His vigil on the Mount of Olives and ended with His mortal death on the Cross. We noted earlier that Gossart's depiction of the crucifix as the True Cross sprouting from the lignum vitae has parallels with works of Italian painters but not with those of his Flemish con- temporaries. This detail strongly implies that Gossart may have known Italian models when he executed the St. Jerome Penitent ;53 thus it may bear directly on the date of the work. The discussion of the painting's chronology near the beginning of this paper ended by pointing out that the altar wings share stylistic affinities with drawings Gossart made in Rome during the first half of 1509. His treatment of the crucifix would seem to be another piece of evidence in favor of dating the St. Jerome Penitent to the early years of Gossart's post-Roman activity (i.e. 1509/10-1512). The preceding analysis indicates that Gossart's exposure to Italian art did not result in radical stylistic modifications or in a wholesale absorption of Italianate ornamental motifs. Gossart's Roman drawings clearly indicate that he reacted to the Italian environment in a predictable manner - as a Fleming, and in accordance with his training. He saw and ingested a great deal, storing his observations in sketchbooks for consultation at a later date, when called upon specifically to use what he had seen and learned during his Roman sojourn. When Gossart returned to Flanders in 1509, his potential patrons were not yet devoted to Italian fashions. There was no need to create - no market for - works of an Italianate character. What Gossart was concerned with in the early teens of the sixteenth century was monumentalizing his style, and this he could, and did, accomplish by studying the rich heritage of his native predecessors. 70</page><page sequence="14">1 Gossarťs surname for some reason is often spelled "Gossaert" in many museums here and abroad, and in much of the literature devoted to him. Why this is so is not clear. Gossarťs signed paintings and drawings clearly indicate that he did not spell his name with the extra "e", nor do his signatures or references to him in contemporary documents include the addition.

VIII, Berlin, 1930, p. 44f.: "Das aus dem Süden Mitgebrachte wurde spät, unkonsequent und äusserlich verwertet. Wäre Gossart durch die Blickerlebnisse um 1508 in seinem Geschmack und seiner Gestaltungsweise mit einem Schlag in der Tiefe gewandelt worden, so müsste die Wirkung der italienischen Vorbilder in den unmittelbar nach der Reise geschaffenen Werke am deutlichsten bemerkbar sein. Dies aber ist nicht der Fall." Similar conclusions were already set forth by F. Winkler, "Die Anfänge Jan Gossarts." Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen, vol. XLII, 1921, pp. 5-19. 3 A rather amusing example of the attitude towards Gossart and other sixteenth-century Flemish painters in older literature is illustrated by these words by J. A. Crowe, "Mabuse, Jan," The Encyclopaedia Britannica , vol. XVII, 11th ed., 1910-11, p. 189: "Mabuse appears to have chiefly studied in Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He not only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion of travelling to Italy; and from that time till the age of Rubens and Van Dyck it was considered proper that all Flemish painters should visit the peninsula. The Flemings grafted Italian mannerisms on their own stock; and the cross turned out so unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of originality." 4NGA 1119.

For Jerome's biography, apart from the Bollandist literature, consult the useful footnotes in G. Ring, "St. Jerome Extracting the Thorn from the Lion's Foot," Art Bulletin, vol. XXVII, 1945, pp. 188-194; and A. Pöllman, "Von der Entwicklung der Hieronimus-Typus in der älteren Kunst," Benediktinische Monatsschrift, vol. II, 1920, pp. 438ff.; Dom P. Antin, Essai sur Saint Jérôme, Paris, 1951, bibliography on pp. 251-257. 12 This aspect of the painting is perhaps easier to appreciate today than when the painting was first completed. Many areas of the surface seem to be worn thin. 13 This glaze is patchy - it has, for instance, disappeared from St. Jerome's face and the right side of his torso. Figure 2 shows a vertical scratch and paint losses to the side of the saint's right hand in precisely those areas where the glaze no longer appears. Infrared photography shows St. Jerome's face is still in good condition (Fig. 4), although an ultraviolet photograph indicates that it is covered with a heavy protective layer of a substance that shows up as black under ultraviolet light (Fig. 5). 14 The supreme craftsman Albrecht Dürer fairly assessed Gossarťs qualities as early as 1520 when he paid a special visit to Middelburg (Zeeland) to see one of Gossarťs important (since lost) works of which he said that it is "not as good in composition as in execution" ("nit so gut im haupstreichen als in gemähl"). See H. Rupprich, Dürer, Schriftlicher Nachlass, vol. I, Berlin, 1956, p. 162, and note 393. Rupprich misconstrues the meaning of Dürer's appraisal; he interprets "hauptstreichen" as "drawing of heads" and "gemähl" as "coloring." Rupprich cites for comparison E. Schön, Unterweisung der Proportzion, Nürnberg, 1538, in which the former term refers to the cubic divisions of the head in a theoretical demonstration of bodily proportion. Dürer, however, used the word in an artistic judgment, where the meaning as translated above seems clear. 15 M. J. Friedländer, Von Eyck bis Bruegel, Berlin, 1916 (2nd ed. 1921), p. 198; F.

See the relevant documents in GEC, op. cit. in note 1 above, pp. 373-375, doc. nos. 2-7. 23 GEC, op. cit. in note 1 above, pp. 51-54, no. 1; pp. 235-236, no. 43; pp. 239-240, no. 44. 24 GEC, op. cit. in note 1 above, pp. 76-90, nos. 7-9.

Landscapes do appear, of course, behind figures of saints, donors, or other scenes, but these are painted in colors to imitate nature. Rogier van der Weyden included landscape elements on the grisaille faces of his Sforza Altarpiece, Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Brussels, but these scenes are enclosed by a niche and they are treated as sculptures. See P. Philippot, "Les grisailles et les 'degrés de réalité' dans l'image dans la peinture flamande des XVe et XVIe siècle," Bulletin , Koninklijke Musea voor Schone Künsten van België, vol. XV, 1966, pp. 225-242, especially p. 239. For further comments on Rogier's altarpiece, see note 31 below. 27 K. van Mander, Het Schilders-Boeck, Haarlem, 1604, fol. 226 (edition of H. Floerke, vol. I, Munich and Leipzig, 1906, pp. 202-203). 28 Reproduced in Friedländer, op. cit. in note 2 above, pl. V. Perhaps even more pertinent is the St. Jerome Penitent which occupies the outer faces of an altarpiece attributed to the Delft Master by Friedlander, op. cit. in note 2 above, vol. X, Leiden, 1934, pl. XXXVIII, and p. 45. On the basis of inscriptions, the Delft Master's work can be dated c.1520. Like Gossart's grisaille, the wings of the Delft Master's altarpiece are small, show one continuous space in both panels, and there is no dividing frame. 29 There are only two examples in Flemish painting known to me, and both pose a dating problem. The first is a weak work in the Basel museum attributed to Memling; the panel could be by a follower, and therefore its date is not necessarily circumscribed by the chronological limits of Memling's life. See Friedländer, op. cit. in note 2 above, vol. VI, Berlin, 1928, p. 124, no. 43. The second, listed as no. 221 in the same volume of Friedländer, is in the National Gallery, London; Friedländer assigned the work to the period about 1500 and attributed the panel to Gerard David. M. Davies, Les Primitifs flamands , corpus, etc., The National Gallery, London, vol. I, Antwerp, 1953, pp. 106-107, no. 44, indicates that the date and attribution to David are uncertain. Aside from the paintings, worth mentioning are some prints by masters active near the end of the fifteenth century. There is a penitent St. Jerome in the background of a print showing the saint extracting the thorn from the lion's paw, attributed to the Master with the Banderoles (L. 68) , and a second, simply showing the penitent saint, attributed to the Master of the Heiligentafel. See F. W. H. Hollstein, Dutch and Flemish Etchings, Engraving and Woodcuts 1400-1750, vol. XII, Amsterdam, 1961, pp. 51 and 182, respectively, for the two prints named above. 30 The famous work in question is the panel, now lost, formerly owned by the Medici. A second Eyckian version is now in the Detroit Institute of Arts; for discussion of both works and the influence of the former, see E. Panofsky, Early Netherlandish Painting, vol. I, Cambridge (Mass.), 1953, pp. 189-190, and vol. II, pl. 189, fig. 258. 31 There are two pertinent works : the grisaille outer wings of the Sforza Altarpiece, Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Brussels, and the small panel now in the Detroit Institute of Arts; the attribution of both works is problematic, though without question related to Rogier. See Ring, op. cit. in note 1 1 above, pp. 188-194, figs. 1 and 2; Friedländer, op. cit. in note 2 above, vol. II, Berlin, 1924, p. 121, and Friedländer, op. cit. in note 2 above, vol.

Panofsky, The Art and Life of Albrecht Dürer, 4th ed., Princeton, 1955, p. 77. 34 The works cited in the notes which follow do not include all the known penitent St. Jeromes. The examples singled out seemed to me relevant to Gossart's painting. The numerous depictions of the penitent saint by Joachim Patinir are passed over because they are obviously later than the panel here discussed. For Patinir, see R. A. Koch, Joachim Patinir, Princeton, 1968, figs. 1, 26-28, 30, 34-36. There are also important examples in the oeuvres of Joos van Cleve and Lucas van Leyden, and this list could be extended. 35 The representations of the penitent St. Jerome from Bruges are all authorless, but usually assigned to the Memling-David circle. The David group, all related to the panel in the National Gallery, London (Davies, op. cit. in note 29 above, pp. 106-107) , is known in at least seven versions, most of which are attributed to Adrian Isenbrandt (see references in Davies, op. cit. in note 29 above, p. 107 ) . See also the version reproduced here, Figure 5. Two other panels with different compositions are in the Capilla Real, Granada, invs. 4 and 20. See J. Lavallaye, Les Primitifs flamands, II, répertoire, etc., collections d'Espagne, vol. II, Antwerp, 1958, pp. 39-40, nos. 92 and 93, pl. XXVII. 36 See the composition attributed to Albert Bouts, Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, inv. 348 (Friedländer, op. cit. in note 2 above, vol. Ill, no. 73; he also lists a homeless replica formerly in the von Kaufmann collection, Berlin ) . See also the English translation, op. cit. in note 31 above, vol. Ill, p. 69, 72</page><page sequence="16">no. 73, pl. 83. Friedländer, op. cit. in note 31 above, no. 98 (English translation, pl. 100) also lists a panel by a follower of Dirck Bouts. In this work the crucifix is missing, either because the panel was formerly accompanied by a pendant, or because it was trimmed ( the catalogue entry states that the panel is rounded at the top; the reproduction shows a rectangular composition) . The panel is now homeless. 37 These are the works by Albert Bouts, the follower of Dirck Bouts, and the two panels in the Capilla Real, Granada, cited in note 36 above. 38 Representations of St. Jerome bearded and clean shaven are commented on by W. Meinhof, "Leonardos Hieronymus," Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft , vol. LH, 1931, pp. 101-124, especially pp. 107ff. The author categorically places the origins of the beardless St. Jerome in the Netherlands; by the 1460's the Flemish painters had introduced the motif to the Italians. Meinhof fails to observe, however, that the beardless saint as a rule is shown as a scholar or churchman, while the bearded saint is depicted as a penitent. Leonardo's painting is an exception; other Italian examples are pointed out in note 40 below. 39 The distinction is made rather specifically in a number of works. See for instance the engraving by the Master of the Banderoles cited in note 29 above. 40 These exceptions seem to occur in Italy only where St. Jerome is depicted as a penitent in conjunction with other saints or in larger scenes. See the fresco fragment by Antonio Poliamolo in S. Domenico, Pistoia ( reproduced in B. Berenson, Italian Pictures of the Renaissance. . ., Florentine School, vol. II, London, 1963, fig. 782) ; Perugino in two related compositions, one in the Uffizi, Florence, the other in the Andrew Mellon Collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. ( reproduced in Berenson, op. cit., Central Italian and North Italian Schools, vol. Ill, London, 1968, figs. 1096 and 1097). Leonardo da Vinci's St. Jerome Penitent, Pinacoteca, Vatican, also seems to be beardless. Cf. also Meinhof, op. cit. in note 38 above, pp. 107ÎÏ. 41 Reproduced in Berenson, op. cit. in note 40 above, Venetian School, vol.

Friedmann, The Symbolic Goldfinch (Bollingen Series, VII) , Washington, D.C., 1946, pp. 7ff.

Cited here from F. Hartt, "Lignum vitae in medio Paradisi; The Stanza d'Eliodoro and the Sistine Ceiling," Art Bulletin, vol. XXXII, 1950, pp. 115-145; and pp. 181-218. St. Ambrose's text is quoted in the first part of Hartt's article in footnote 111. 49 The medieval symbolism of the tree and its relationship to the True Cross is treated in a number of places. See, for instance: K. Künstle, Ikonographie der christlichen Kunst, vol. I, Freiberg, 1926, s.v. "Kreuz," pp. 486ff.; W. Föhl, "Baum," Reallexikon zur deutschen Kunst- geschichte (hereafter cited: RDK) , vol. II, 1948, cols. 63-90; H. Bethe. "Baumkreuz," RDK, vol. II, 1948, cols. 100-105; H. Bethe, "Astkreuz," RDK, vol. I, 1937, cols. 1152-1161; J. J. M. Timmers, Smyboliek en Iconographie der Christlijke Kunst, Roermond and Maaseik, 1947, articles 591-600; for the special problem of the leafy and withered tree, see M. R. Bennett, "The Legend of the Green Tree and the Dry," Archeological Journal , vol. XXXIII, 1926, pp. 21-32. Bennett's article was kindly pointed out to me by Mr. Glen M. Andres. The large number of texts cited in the first part of the article by Hartt, op. cit. in note 48 above, pp. 115ff., are worth especial attention; see specifically footnotes 103, 104, 108, 109, 110-114, 121, and 151. 50 The material in the remainder of this paragraph is a condensation of Bennett, op. cit. in note 49 above, pp. 23-31. 51 H. Maurus, De laudibus Sanctae Crucis, Pforzheim, 1503. Quoted from Hartt, op. cit. in note 49 above, footnote 108. 52 The text reads: "In arbore perivimus, in arbore redempti sumus; in ligno mors, in ligno vita pependit." Cited from Timmers, op. cit. in note 49 above, article 592; see also Föhl, op. cit. in note 48 above, col. 63. 53 The shape of the crucifix in the St. Jerome Penitent, used twice more by Gossart ( see GEC, op. cit. in note 1 above, pp. 113-118, no. 13/14; and pp. 267-268, no. 51), seems to me somewhat unusual. The tau-shaped cross was used extensively in the Netherlands since at least the time of Rogier van der Weyden, where, however, the inscription INRI is affixed directly to the crossbar in various ways. The use of a rod to support a small plaque for the inscription, as in Gossarťs works, seems to be of Italian derivation, where, however, the tau-shaped cross was not common. Gossart's rendering of the crucifix, it would seem, combines Flemish and Italian models. 73</page></plain_text>
