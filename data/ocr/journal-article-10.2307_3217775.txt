However, among DeBlasi's main supporting cases, Liu Yuxi (772-842) does not really give such a view. Quan Deyu always linked the emperor with his ministers as the pivot of the moral-political order. As to Bai Juyi (772- 846), evidence is adduced only from his examination practice essays, the significance of which can be disputed. More problematic is DeBlasi's use of Liu Zongyuan as the chief guwen representative to contrast with the mainstream's political outlook. If DeBlasi had chosen Han Yu, rather than Liu, as representative, he would find that the dividing line largely disappears. DeBlasi's concentration on drawing a clearly systematized picture may not be the best strategy to present his subject. Overall, DeBlasi's book is a valuable achievement in the expanding scholarship on Tang-Song in- tellectual history. It raises and explores a new question and makes important points along the way. Its examination of Liu Yuxi's intellectual position, for instance, deserves serious consideration. DeBlasi is sensitive to issues related to literary culture, but weaker when dealing with relations between thought and society, and with religion. It is somewhat ironic that the best chapter in the book may be the one on guwen ideas (chapter 5). Clearly, this is because the chapter is built upon solid studies by earlier scholars. From this perspective, one may be confident that DeBlasi's work will lead to other contributions in the future. JO-SHUI CHEN ACADEMIA SINICA Zhu Xi's Reading of the Analects: Canon, Commentary, and the Classical Tradition. By DANIEL K. GARDNER. New York: COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2003. Pp. 226. $52.50 (cloth); $19.50 (paper). This is a small gem of a book, representing Gardner's latest contribution to a relatively recent trend of approaching the Analects from a more hermeneutically informed perspective-that is, of viewing the text as embedded in a historical context rather than as an ahistorical object of study. (Other recent examples of this trend include Tu Ching-i, ed., Classics and Interpretations [Transaction Publishers, 2000]; Kai-wing Chow et al., eds., Imagining Boundaries: Changing Confucian Doctrines, Texts, and Hermeneutics [State Univ. of New York Press, 1999); John Henderson, Scripture, Canon, Commen- tary [Princeton Univ. Press, 1991]; John Kieschnick, 'Analects 12.1 and the Commentarial Tradition," JAOS 112 [1992]: 567-76; and P. J. Ivanhoe, "Whose Confucius? Which Analects?" in Confucius and the Analects, ed. B. Van Norden [Oxford Univ. Press, 2002], 119-33.) Such approaches tend to focus on how the Analects has historically been received by the tradition, and view the text as having, as Gardner puts it, "no one real meaning ... the true meaning of the Analects is the actual meaning that actual readers, to whom the text is meaningful, discover in it. This actual meaning evolves over time and place" (p. 178). One might contrast this approach with that of, say, Bruce and Taeko Brooks' Original Analects (Columbia Univ. Press, 1998), the goal of which is to recover the original meaning of the book through a detailed hypothesis of its formation as a text. As Gardner notes, "as fascinating and important as such [studies] are, they shed little light on how the text as received by the tradition was in fact understood by Chinese for the past two millennia" (p. 28, n. 44). An ahistorical attitude is reflected in most Western translations of the Analects, which translate only the primary text, usually gliding smoothly over the interpretive decisions that must be made at almost every point in the process. Ahistorical approaches mask the opaqueness of the primary text, which is in many places incomprehensible without commentarial input, and obscure the fact that "the understanding that virtually every Chinese reader of the Analects since the Han period takes away from the text"-and therefore the understanding of Western translators and commentators relying upon these readers-"is dependent on the commentarial tradition accompanying it" (p. 78). As Gard- ner notes, the genre of interlinear commentary "seeks the meaning of each of [the Master's] utter- ances, even while it circumscribes the meaning of those utterances," thereby helping to "create" the text itself (p. 78). 677</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 123.3 (2003) The choice the commentator makes evolves out of a complex dialectic in which the words of the text, pregnant with possible meanings, interacts with the commentator's intellectual con- cerns and assumptions, which themselves develop out of the contemporary zeitgeist. This in- teraction between text and commentator results in the particular commentary, which thus may serve as a window on the intellectual disposition of the commentator-as well as that of his age. (p. 5) Gardner's goal in this book is to help illuminate the nature of tradition Chinese texts such as the Ana- lects by exploring the genre of interlinear commentary and demonstrating its importance in a particu- lar corner of the history of Chinese thought. This is an important contribution, as this genre has remained generally underappreciated by Western scholars possessed by what one might characterize as a more "Protestant" desire to acquire unmediated contact with the original author(s), and with a more romantic ideal of intellectual creativity that privileges independent philosophical works over commentaries on the classics-despite the fact that the latter genre has been the primary medium for both cultural transmission and intellectual innovation in Chinese history. The organization of the book is simple. We are given passages from the Analects in both He Yan's and Zhu Xi's commentary, organized around five central themes: learning, "True Goodness" (ren), ritual, ruling, and "the Superior Man and the Way." In a recent translation of the full text of the Ana- lects (Confucius: Analects [Hackett, 2003]) I provided selections from traditional commentaries in an attempt to locate the primary text in its commentarial context, but the format employed by Gard- ner here is much more helpful in this regard. He does not merely provide a translation of the primary text followed by both sets of commentary-which might give the impression that the meaning of the primary text was obvious, with the commentary simply appended for further explanation-but rather retranslates the primary text itself in light of the commentary that follows. This provides the reader, especially one unfamiliar with classical Chinese, with a more precise illustration of how interlinear commentary actively shapes one's understanding of the primary text, rather than serving as a mere appendage to it. The thematic organization of the passages also helps Gardner demonstrate how the answer to certain questions, such as the relationship of ritual to Goodness, depends very much upon which commentator one is reading the text through. This suggests that debates in Western scholarship concerning the relationship of ritual to ren in the text are perhaps misguided in seeking to establish the one relationship-there are, in fact, many relationships reflected in competing commentarial tra- ditions. Gardner points out how Herbert Fingarette's and Benjamin Schwartz's stances on Goodness and ritual in fact echo and track traditional commentarial debates, which in turn can be traced all the way back to the ur-commentators on the Analects, Mencius and Xunzi. The primary focus of the book is, of course, Zhu Xi and his shaping of the Confucian tradition. Gardner notes that it is possible for interpreters to be more or less activist, and throughout the book contrasts He Yan's more "historical" approach-intended to preserve and transmit a received tradi- tion, keeping personal contribution to a minimum-with Zhu Xi's "didactic" approach, which is more aggressively and self-consciously activist. Zhu Xi is portrayed as a Confucian proselytizer in- troducing contemporary metaphysics to the Analects in order to increase its appeal to a potentially re- sistant audience, using commentary as his tool, and Gardner does a very good job of mapping out the hermeneutical assumptions that informs Zhu's approach to the canon. For instance, the degree of lib- erty Zhu took with the text was facilitated by Zhu's confidence that "his mind had become one with the mind of the sages. Through serious investigation of the tradition and in particular through consci- entious reflection on the canon, he had indeed achieved total understanding of principle and had 'en- ter[ed] the realm of the sages and worthies.' The intentions of these sages of the past were now perfectly clear to him" (p. 169). This idea of the Analects as the expression of some ahistorical truth also informs Zhu's "assumption of coherence" (p. 40), both within the Analects itself and between the Analects and other discovered classics such as the Great Learning and Doctrine of the Mean. This motivates Zhu to attempt systematically to reconcile contradictions that arise in the text, whereas He Yan is generally content to let them stand. There are some minor quibbles one could raise concerning the specifics of Gardner's presentation. Although he does note near the end (pp. 171-74) He Yan's tendency to impose Daoist metaphysics 678</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books on the text, throughout most of the book he implicitly presents He Yan as the historicist baseline against which to measure the commentarial innovations of Zhu Xi. It would have been interesting to have explored He Yan's own assumptions in a more systematic fashion. Also, more could have been said about the specifics of the Buddhist influences on Zhu Xi and his reading of the Analects. Gardner notes the obvious features, such as the introduction of the concepts of "principle" and "material force," but presents as traditionally "Mencian" the strong theories of innate goodness that Zhu Xi reads into the Analects. As scholars such as P. J. Ivanhoe have argued (see his Confucian Moral Self Cultivation [Peter Lang, 1993], 50-55), however, the "discovery" model of self-cultivation one finds in neo-Confucianism is a far cry from Mencian developmentalism, and is itself a result of reading Buddhist metaphysics into Mencius. Indeed, one could argue that the very choice of Mencius as the orthodox successor of Confucius reveals the influence of contemporary belief in an unspoiled "Bud- dha nature." Overall, though, this is a revealing book, well worth the read for anyone interested in the development of the Confucian tradition or the more general phenomenon of commentary and canon formation. EDWARD SLINGERLAND UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA Phantasmic Anatomy of the Statues of Mathura. By SANDRINE GILL. New Delhi: MUNSHIRAM MANOHARLAL, 2000. Pp. xxvii + 112, figs., illus. Rs 450. The question most often asked by a visitor to a gallery of Indian art is "Why do the images have many heads, arms, and eyes?" Upon noting that such images represent deities, the visitor, especially the Western visitor, is often so perplexed that his appreciation of the art is considerably diminished. Attributing multiple bodily parts as well as animal parts and forms to the divine bewilders the general Western viewer. This bewilderment could be sustained from about the sixteenth century onwards, that is, ever since the West first came into contact with Indian art, because of a dearth of objective analyses. The first scholarly book analyzing India's special vision of the divine was an historical ac- count of Europe's encounter and reaction to such icons. Partha Mitter's Much Maligned Monsters certainly broke fresh ground when it appeared in 1980. It was not, however, until the publication of the first art historical accounts within the last fifteen years that interpretation of the icons took center stage. In 1988 and then in 1997 two scholarly monographs appeared to investigate "why" and "what are the meanings behind the iconographic conventions." Sandrine Gill's book is the third. It focuses on deities portrayed with many bodily parts or with a fusion of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic parts. Unlike the preceding works, hers is dedicated ex- clusively to understanding the stylistic aspects of such renderings. As she sees it, Mathura, during the first three centuries of the Christian era, created icons of the gods which "are in fact literal translations of their supernatural powers." The anatomy given the gods can be characterized as "phantasmic," that is, unreal, imaginary, or fantastic. The addition of limbs and forms, and the combination of human and animal bodies, result in the phantasmic anatomy of her title. Gill wants to know how the artist solved the problem of fusing or juxtaposing forms not seen in nature. "The aim of this study is to present a typology of the human anatomic transformation but there are also numerous other types of combina- tions as the imaginary bestiary" (p. xxv). She isolates three types: the multiplication of limbs and bod- ies, the fusion of two bodies, and the replacement of a human head by an animal head. With no pretense at drawing conclusions from an exhaustive sculptural corpus, Gill devotes four chapters to these types in order to determine the ways multiplicity and other imaginary anatomical inventions were depicted mainly in the early art of Mathura. 1.
