Clark Published online: 24 June 2009 © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract In the Indus Civilization (ca. 2600-1900 bc), a society with no readable texts and few larger-scale representations, terracotta figurines were the most common representations of the human body. This paper explores the unique construction of the material representations of bodies and other material culture from Harappa, a major Indus site now in Pakistan. Hand-modeling representations of human bodies from dual clay pieces, sometimes decorated with bone pigments, suggests a focus on the process and ideological rather than practical choices in the materialization of the Harappan human body. For the Harappans, material matters as they engage physically with their world and embody themselves and their worldview. Keywords Indus Civilization • Harappa • Figurines • Representation • Materiality In the Indus Civilization, which peaked ca. 2600-1900 bc in what is now Pakistan and northwestern India, some of the most intriguing artifacts and the most common representations of the human body are terracotta figurines. The purpose of creating these material representations of the Harappan body and how they were used remain unclear. Since they are almost always found in garbage or fill deposits and there are no informants or deciphered texts to provide contextual information, the figurines' "social lives" or histories and their function(s) in Harappan society are difficult to assess. This leaves us with the figurines themselves as the primary evidence of the Harappans' views of the human body and as material evidence of their engagement with their world. Material and manufacturing choices in the materialization of the human body provide clues to their possible uses and meanings. This paper explores the figurines from Harappa as a symbolic and social process through which the Harappans engaged with the world around them, necessarily focusing on the beginning of their "lives" or their creation.

Rather than more efficiently molding the figurines, hand-modeling representations of human bodies from dual clay pieces, sometimes decorated with bone pigments, suggests a focus on the process and ideological rather than practical choices in the materialization of the Harappan human body. The figurines' archeological contexts are also examined for further insights into their life histories. Even with the limited information provided by these contexts, the figurines themselves and the human choices they represent offer intriguing clues to Harappan materiality. In other words, material mattered as the Harappans engaged physically with their world and embodied themselves and their worldview. Representation, Materiality, and Ontological Issues Some of the most provocative recent research on human representation and the body in archeology has focused on issues such as representation, materiality, agency, and subjectivity (e.g., Meskell 2004; Nakamura 2005; Nanoglou 2005, 2008b), as well as taxonomies of figurines and other material culture (see Meskell 2007; Meskell et al. 2008). Unfortunately, terms such as "representation", "reflection", and "figural", as well as "materiality", "material culture", and "material" are sometimes conflated. Before discussing the representation and materiality of the terracotta figurines from Harappa, it is important to clarify some of these terms. Human representations such as figurines are remarkably common in the material culture of ancient and modern societies, prompting some scholars to ask to what extent individuals recognize themselves in their replicas (Meskell 2004: 45). What were the roles of figurines in ancient societies, what did they mean to the people in those societies, and how did they create meaning? Some important early formal or attribute analyses of figurines (e.g., Talalay 1993; Voigt 1983) emphasized a clear distinction between representation (or meaning) and function, based in part on contextual data, and provided an initial framework for systematically classifying and quantifying archeological data for further analyses - or what figurines represented. Recent studies seek to understand how - how figurines became material (sometimes enlivened) objects, how figurines both functioned in and acted upon ancient societies, and how figurines reflected and shaped the experiences and subjectivities of their makers. In addition, terms such as "representation" have been used in different ways. Stratos Nanoglou (2008a: 2) construes representation as an articulatory practice that cites and rearticulates the form it resembles. He contrasts reflection as possibly deceptive "iconic resemblances" that always convey normative ideas concerning the nature of the entities represented even when they aim to reflect their prototypes. Some scholars argue that representation implies a remove from the real - depicting a likeness, rendition, or perception rather than the immediacy of the object - incorrectly implying that figurines stand in for and refer to something real when they themselves are already "real" (Meskell et al. 2008: 141). Other scholars (e.g., £\ Springer</page><page sequence="3">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 233 Nanoglou 2008a: 2) point out that the term "representation" does not mean that figurines are reflections of actual life, although it is possible that they are. I have argued elsewhere that whether or not they are representations of actual life, figurines can implicitly reflect or embody a society's mores (e.g., dress and ornamentation) and serve as media of communication in their original social contexts (Clark 2007a), and they may have multiple meanings and functions over time. Nanoglou (2008a: 1-2) argues against treating material culture as a reflection of already given human intentionalities - against approaching representations as things made to communicate a message, as vehicles of intentions or "intentionally expressive objects" (see Bailey 2005). Figurines are more than representations or reflections of something concrete or abstract and more than vehicles created to communicate a message - they are objects with material lives. Understanding what they were and how they were engaged in ancient societies is only possible by understanding their archeological and cultural contexts. Approaching the figurines as representations of the body and materializa- tions of human experience provides a different perspective, one of mutual constitution. In other words, "we make objects and they in turn make us" (Meskell 2004: 4). The recent emphasis in archeology on materiality, or the complex mutual interaction between material culture and human actions and how this shapes both objects and societies, complements studies of modern material culture and materiality in anthropology (e.g., Attfield 2000; Miller 1987, 2005; Schiffer 1999; Skibo and Schiffer 2008) and other fields. Focusing on the creation of relations between people and objects or meaning-making rather than meaning per se, some scholars have innovatively revisited semiotic approaches to interpreting figurines (e.g., Joyce 2007). Others have explored the nature of materiality, replication, objectification, and agency in the complex ancient and sometimes modern biographies of objects in the contexts of their object worlds (Meskell 2004). Agreeing that no single theory or understanding of materiality will suffice, Lynn Meskell defines materiality broadly as "the constitution of the material world in antiquity" - our physical engagement with the world, our medium for inserting ourselves into the fabric of that world, and our way of constituting and shaping culture in an embodied and external sense (Meskell 2004: 1, 11, 50, 177). Other approaches to materiality focus on the relationships between people and things in the present as the foundation for archeological reconstruction of the past. This behavioral approach is well illustrated in James Skibo 's and Michael Schiffer 's recent work on a theory of artifact design that includes four components: life history/behavioral chain, activities and interactions, technical choices, and perfor- mance characteristics and compromises (Skibo and Schiffer 2008). This model for investigating material culture variability and change can help us understand how people negotiate throughout an artifact's life history the social, religious, and other factors that affect the technological choices people make and the meanings behind these technological choices or their "behavioral significance" (Schiffer and Skibo 1987; Skibo and Schiffer 2008). Following on a number of important studies of material culture and materiality, Daniel Miller's work on material "mattering" also addresses finding meanings behind technical choices (Miller 1998). &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="4">234 Clark The trope of biography or life history applied to artifacts in their original contexts is useful (see Clark 2007a: 3-4; also see Meskell 2004: 55-58 for a critique), as "even though from a theoretical point of view, human actors encode things with significance, from a methodological point of view, it is the things-in-motion that illuminate their human and social context" (Appadurai 1986: 5, emphasis in the original). Not only are "things" (e.g., terracotta figurines) encoded with significance or meaning by human actors in a society, "things-in-motion" (objects moving through different phases of their "lives" in societies from creation to disposition and destruction) can provide insight into the societies in which they moved. This point was made to some degree in Ananda Coomaraswamy's (1928: 76) early discussion of South Asian terracotta figurines as "documents of life". These concepts are also the centerpiece of the performance-based life history approach where "performances" are the actions or uses of artifacts in various roles throughout their lives or "behavioral chain" (see Skibo and Schiffer 2008). Perhaps the interest in materiality stems from a need to resurrect the "material" in material culture, after a long preoccupation with just "culture" in the interpretation of the inhabitation of a material world (Nanoglou 2008b: 312). In his recent study of Greek Neolithic anthropomorphic imagery, Stratos Nanoglou (2008b) addresses some of the critiques of materiality (e.g., Ingold 2007) and stresses that materialization is contingent upon, but not reducible to, the materials used in an object, and likewise, materiality is not equivalent to "things" or their properties. In other words, materialization is how beings (animate and inanimate) "come to matter", and matter is a process of materialization that stabilizes over time governed by identifiable discourses (Nanoglou 2008b: 313-314, citing Butler 1993). Identifying these discourses is not the same as finding abstract rules that governed social life in the past, but rather bringing forth the ways that people, animals, and things "came to matter" through the rearticulation of previous practices in particular contexts (Nanoglou 2008b: 314). Therefore, we can approach figurines as part of discourses that enabled and governed social life, as material conditions that provided a framework which someone had to come to terms with and which could be used in order to find a place in the world (Nanoglou 2008a: 2). Thus, materiality focuses on social relations and the dialectic of people and things, as well as the "thingness" of things (e.g., see Attfield 2000; Meskell 2004) or being a material thing. Agency and subjectivity may be implicated in materiality as well, particularly in the case of figurines. While objects do not have lives of their own outside of human constitution (see Meskell 2004: 4-6), objects do have some agency in that they have effect and impact upon human actions and lives (see Gell 1998). Although scholars have typically approached subjectivity through sex and gender, sex/gender is not necessarily the primary structuring principle in people's identities (Nanoglou 2005: 142). Recent broader studies on the role of anthropomorphic imagery and the constitution of subjects in ancient societies focus on how the materiality of human representation would have impacted people's experience of their own materiality, referring explicitly to their own bodies (e.g., Nanoglou 2005, 2008b). Ancient conceptions of figurines may have been more nuanced than the categories now imposed by archeologists, as we sometimes look for our own culturally constructed demarcators when identifying figurines. In fact, "figurines" may not have been considered a distinct category in ancient societies (see Meskell 4y Springer</page><page sequence="5">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 235 1995, 2004, 2007; Meskell et al. 2008; Nanoglou 2005). Categorizing objects by material {e.g., figurines with other clay objects) or by function {e.g., magical objects of various materials and forms) may have aligned better with ancient conceptions of objects than the categories now imposed by archeologists (Meskell 2004: 39-58). For example, figurines and pottery may not have been conceptualized as different categories in ancient societies (see Nanoglou 2005, 2008b: 318; Bailey 2005: 187- 188; also Joyce 2007). Some of the ambiguities of classification are illustrated in the typology of the terracotta figurines from Harappa, which includes wheeled and/or open-bodied vessel/figurines, zoomorphic attachments to vessel rims, zoomorphic bottle stoppers, and anthropomorphic figurines attached to miniature beds, carts, and other objects (Clark 2007a, chapter 5 and Appendix F). Although categorizations are useful in organizing archeological data, they clearly represent extrapolations from modern to ancient conceptions. In this paper, I argue that in ancient societies' representations of the body, material matters. How it matters - what the selection of different materials and types of materialization means for people negotiating their presence in their social worlds - is the question. This paper explores the implications of fired clay and particular construction techniques for figurines as material representations of human bodies in comparison with other material culture at Harappa as a case study in representation and materiality for the Indus Civilization. This is based on a recent systematic contextual study of the entire corpus of terracotta figurines from Harappa and exploration of the figurines' "social lives" (Clark 2007a; Clark in press). The aim of this paper is to continue this exploration of how the Harappans physically engaged with and inserted themselves into the fabric of their world through terracotta figurines - how they constituted and shaped themselves and their culture in an embodied and external sense through figurines at Harappa. The Indus Civilization and the Harappan Figurines In the Indus Civilization (ca. 2600-1900 bc), a society with no surviving monumental and few large representations of the human body, the body is primarily constituted as relatively small-scale arguably three-dimensional terracotta figurines. Characterized by an emphasis on small elegant art and sophisticated craft technology and a conspicuous absence of monumental art or other sculpture (see Kenoyer 1998; Possehl 1998), this so-called "faceless civilization" (Possehl 1998: 279) is most abundantly and richly embodied in the terracotta figurines. The richness and diversity of the Indus terracotta figurine corpus offers provocative insights into Indus ideology and society, despite its still undeciphered script. The Indus (or "Harappan") Civilization (ca. 2600-1900 bc), the earliest urban civilization of South Asia, at its peak extended over much of what is now Pakistan and northwestern India (Fig. 1). Most of the known sites are concentrated in river valleys, particularly around the Indus River and the now dry Ghaggar-Hakra River, identified as the ancient Saraswati River mentioned in Vedic texts by certain scholars who prefer the term "Indus-Saraswati Civilization" (Gupta 1996). The term "Indus" is used here to refer to the broader civilization, and "Harappan" is used to refer more specifically to the site of Harappa.

The particular Indus artifacts found at each site vary somewhat, perhaps reflecting the regional traditions the Indus subsumes and incorporates as well as site size and function and environmental constraints. In fact, terracotta figurines are rare in the eastern regions of the Indus Civilization, and the figurine types, classified albeit subjectively according to certain codified attributes (see Clark 2007a for a typology from Harappa), vary somewhat in frequency and execution from site to site. Harappa, a major urban Indus site near the Ravi River, has four major mounds (AB, E, ET, and F) with walls of mudbrick and baked brick surrounded by settled areas (C, D, G, and J) and two superimposed cemeteries (Harappa phase Cemetery R37 and Late Harappa phase Cemetery H). Harappa has a long history of excavation since the 1920s (Meadow 1991; Meadow^ al. 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001; Mughal 1968; Vats 1940; Wheeler 1947). The current calibrated radiocarbon date chronology for Harappa indicates continuous occupation of the site from ca. 3300 bc to ca. 1300 bc with five major periods of occupation (see Table I). According to recent research {e.g., Kenoyer and Meadow 2000; Meadow and Kenoyer 2001; Meadow et al. 1999, 2001), Harappa appears to have grown from a small village on Mounds AB and E in the (earliest) Period 1 Ravi phase (ca. 3300-2800 bc) through incipient urbanization in Period 2 (ca. 2800-2600 bc) to a major urban center of 150 hectares covering all mounds and surrounding areas in Period 3 (ca. 2600-1900 bc). Eventually, Harappa transitioned in Period 4 (ca. 1900-1800(7) bc) to a smaller city with changes in material culture that signal a return to regional or local traditions (along with a few foreign artifacts; Lamberg- Karlovsky 1996; Meadow 2002) by Period 5 (ca. 1800(?) to &lt;1300 bc). At least 10,000 terracotta figurine fragments have been recovered from nonprimary trash and fill deposits in most areas of the ancient city of Harappa, with more than 80% of the site yet to be excavated. The majority of the figurines and other material recovered thus far dates to Period 3, the peak of the Indus Civilization. The Harappan figurines are part of a long South Asian figurine tradition. The earliest large corpus of South Asian figurines comes from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic site of Mehrgarh (now in Baluchistan, Pakistan).

A major premise of the author's studies of the figurines from Harappa (Clark 2003, 2005, 2007a, b) is that the figurines, while iconographic or art objects, serve not as simple naturalistic reflections of Indus society but as media of communication and identification in their original social contexts. Although compelling arguments against art as visual communication suggest that art is different from language and that only language can convey "meaning" (Gell 1998: 6), archeological context can provide artifacts such as figurines with evidence of their original social contexts, including functions and uses or meanings. Since there is still no widely accepted decipherment of the Indus script (see Possehl 1 996 for a summary), which fell out of use by the early first millennium bc and may not have been a linguistic writing system at all (see Farmer et al. 2004), well-excavated archeological contexts at Indus sites are even more critical to understanding the original cultural contexts within which to frame interpretations of Indus material culture. Material representations of the body also may provide clues to ancient people's conceptions through close examination of their choices in the materialization and construction of themselves (see Clark 2003). In the absence of readable texts or living informants, the Harappans' material biographies - the construction, use(s), and disposal of figurines and other artifacts - are the sole "texts" available to us as archeologists and interpreters of this ancient society. Figurines as a Symbolic and Social Process: Representing the Harappan Body Decisions about the representation and materialization of the Harappan body reflect the Harappan experience of the world. From the choice of materials to construction techniques, manufacturing choices were meaningful decisions by the manufacturers and users of the Harappan figurines. Material Clay is one of the most common media chosen for three-dimensional representations of the anthropomorphic body - as well as zoomorphic bodies and, in some cases, composite or fantastic bodies - in the Indus Civilization as in many ancient cultures. Indus sites have produced a wide range of terracotta objects, from pottery to ornaments such as bangles and beads to small finds such as balls and tops and other miniaturized objects such as furniture and carts. Even some of the Harappan tablets were made of clay imprinted with seals or molds with iconography and/or Indus script before firing {e.g., Fig. 2), alongside tablets made of more labor-intensive, technologically manipulated materials such as carved and fired steatite and (sometimes multicolor) Indus faience. The fine clay of the terracotta figurines from Harappa was typically tempered with sand, bits of shell, mica, and vegetal material, much like the fabric of the pottery from Harappa, but probably in different proportions. £) Springer</page><page sequence="9">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 239 Although the value or the qualities of the material chosen is often related to the importance of the being or the concept represented, other qualities of the material such as symbolic importance or availability can take precedence (e.g., rough stones representing deities). For example, clay may have been chosen as a medium for anthropomorphic representations such as Indus figurines because of its intrinsic connection to Mother Earth (e.g., Mackay 1938: 258). In fact, "fertile earth" was prescribed for the manufacture of ritual figurines in several later historical Vedic texts (see Srivastava 1996). The creation of humans from earth or clay is a common motif in creation myths from the ancient Near East and elsewhere, and the act of making anthropomorphic representations of clay may have reenacted the creation of human beings or deities symbolically and allegorically (see Amiran 1962; Dales 1 99 1 a; and others). For example, the clay cores in figurines from Neolithic Thessaly Fig. 2 The convex face of a molded planoconvex terracotta tablet from Harappa with a central female figure (with a breast in profile) grasping two felines by the throats shown below a chakra (spoked wheel) sign and above an elephant with the mold marks still visible along the edges (Harappa Museum #H95-2486 (3.9 x 1.6x 0.7 cm); courtesy of the Harappa Archaeological Research Project and the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan, photograph by Richard Meadow (©HARP)). £l Springer</page><page sequence="10">240 Clark have been interpreted as allusions to the skeletal structure of an actual human body, suggesting that making a figurine might have been equivalent to narrating the myth of creation (Hourmouziadis 1973: 40, cited in Nanoglou 2008b: 318). A similar technique was used for a few early Bronze Age (Period 2) seated figurines from Harappa in which inner clay cores were covered with additional clay (see Clark 2007a, Fig. 3.18, top right; also see Fig. 6, top left for a similar example). Of course, there are other possible technological explanations for this type of construction, which is certainly not required to link producing figurines with producing people, as ethnographic evidence also supports the connection between producing different figurines and producing people (see discussion in Nanoglou 2008b: 318). Clay figurines - unfired and fired - have been used to represent important deities from at least the end of the first millennium bc to the present in South Asia (e.g., see Ahuja 2000; Huyler 1996). Whether earlier South Asian figurines represented deities is not certain (see Clark 2005, 2007b). Scholars have long argued both for and against (e.g., Ucko 1968: 417) the use of clay as a medium to represent deities and other supernatural beings based on material qualities such as cheapness and ease of use. Clay's potential for symbolism - as symbolically connected to the earth and to creation - is perhaps balanced by its more mundane qualities. Measured against relative value parameters such as difficulty of access and procurement and relative degree of technological elaboration (e.g., Miller 2006: 212-217, Fig. 6.4 and 6.5), the value of clay or terracotta figurines is relatively low. In fact, terracotta may have been painted to make imitations of more valuable ornaments and other artifacts in the Indus (Kenoyer 1991, 1998: 162). Besides pigments (see below), the only other material embellishment found on the terracotta figurines from Harappa has been copper alloy, a copper bangle on a figurine arm found by the author in the "miscellaneous terracotta objects" drawer in the Archaeological Survey of India collections. Form and Decoration Representations of the Harappan body and Harappan norms of dress and ornamentation have been discussed extensively elsewhere (Clark 2003, 2007a: 185-266) and the details need not be repeated here. In general, the Harappan body as represented in most of the terracotta figurines is rather schematic, sometimes without features such as fingers or even eyes (see Fig. 3 and 4). The Harappan female body (Fig. 3) is typically curvaceous (occasionally globular; Fig. 5) with medium conical breasts. Despite sometimes skewed perceptions of the female figurines as exaggerated bodies (e.g., Dales 1991b: 140), probably based on uncritical interpretations of Indus female figurines as fertility figures and as possible representations of the Mother Goddess since the earliest publications (e.g., Mackay 1938; Marshall 1931; Vats 1940; Wheeler 1947), none of the features are exaggerated. Most of the female figurines are also depicted with headdresses (typically fan-shaped and sometimes decorated with flowers, cones, etc.) and appliqued earpieces. Approximately half of the female figurines are depicted with one or more appliqued or painted necklaces, but rarely (less than 15%) with appliqued or painted bangles, in spite of the ubiquity of actual £} Springer</page><page sequence="11">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 241 Fig. 3 Some examples of female figurine bodies formed from two vertically joined rolls of clay (courtesy of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan, photographs by Georg Helms, J.

Most of the female figurine bodies (85%) are depicted with a narrow belt or skirt sometimes decorated with multiple strands and ornaments over the pubic area, either de-emphasizing or emphasizing the female genitalia by obfuscating it. Earlier Periods 1 and 2 figurine bodies from Harappa were depicted seated with joined legs projecting forward from either heavy hips (see Fig. 6, top left) or wide flattened lower bodies (Fig. 6, bottom left), similar to figurines from Rehman Dheri and other sites in northwestern Pakistan. The former figurines typically have small conical breasts and short pointed raised arms at the sides, and the latter ones have small disk-shaped breasts and are often depicted holding objects or infants against their bodies. Period 2 figurines are sometimes decorated with red slip and brownish-black features and geometric designs (Fig. 6, bottom left). In early Period 3, the former type seems to disappear and the latter type seems to change. The heavy seated lower bodies are made to stand and the raised arms are instead pressed against the sides (Fig. 6, bottom center), while the appliqued decoration (locks and loops of hair) on simple pinched heads become more bun-like attachments around the backs of the heads. By the end of Period 3, these figurines represent a visibly different alternative style of Harappan female body (Fig. 6, top center). They still incorporate most of the standard attributes or codes of typical Harappan female figurines - a triangular/fan- shaped headdress (from an increasingly flattened pinched bun), chokers and longer pendant necklaces, conical breasts, sometimes with an infant nursing at £} Springer</page><page sequence="12">242 Clark Fig. 4 Some examples of male and other-gendered figurine bodies formed from two vertically joined rolls of clay (courtesy of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan, photograph by the author ©Sharri Clark): left seated figurine with arms around the bent knees with no facial or sex characteristics depicted (Harappa Museum #H96-3063); center standing male figurine (Harappa Museum #H98-3495); and right standing figurine with male genitalia and a typically female fan-shaped headdress (Harappa Museum #H87-388). the left breast, and a belt. However, most of the important Harappan codes for the female body are adapted - the headdress is a smaller triangular or rounded fan, the chokers and necklaces are simple multiple strands with only a single round pendant on the longer necklace (rather than multiple pendants on both), and the multiple-strand belts do not cover the pubic areas with skirts (compare Fig. 6, top center, with Figs. 3, 5, and 6, right). Unlike other Period 3 female figurines, these figurines are depicted without mouths or earpieces, with ribbon-like arms, with wider heavier hips, and often with separated legs, sometimes with concave feet. This alternative female figurine type may represent the adaptation of a regional style to the dominant Indus style during Period 3, while maintaining some difference. A similar trend is also seen in the changes in some zebu (humped cattle) figurines in Period 3 (see Clark 2007a, chapter 5). In other words, these figurines ^ Springer</page><page sequence="13">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 243 Fig. 5 Globular female figurine depicted nursing a schematic infant (NMI #230 (height, 7.5 cm), courtesy of the National Museum of India). may represent the materialization of the negotiation of a regional group's identity under Indus domination with adaptations that signal resistance to full assimilation (see Clark 2007a, chapters 5 and 7 for more discussion). Since many other figurine types appear for the first time in Period 3 at Harappa, changes in the anthropomorphic female and cattle figurines, which continue from the earliest periods, are especially significant representations of materializations of societal changes. The Harappan male body is typically relatively slender and often depicted with male genitalia and/or explicit and relatively exaggerated nipples (Fig. 4). The latter subtle physiological feature without reproductive importance may be imbued with cultural significance, mirroring female breasts as a symbolic repository of male sex, gender, and sexuality. This is not necessarily the sexual dualism found in Hinduism (e.g., Marshall 1931), but perhaps something like later Vedic notions of balance in what were considered similar and dangerous body fluids of the upper and lower bodies (O'Flaherty 1980: 55). The equivalence in the representation of male and female upper bodies and the mixed sex/gender attributes on a few figurines suggests a complex and fluid conception of sex and gender in the Harappan world (see Clark 2003). No male figurines have been found in contexts earlier than Period 3 thus far at Harappa. Unlike the female figurines, few of the male figurines and the figurines with no sex characteristics are depicted with headdresses (less than 10%) other than hair or hairstyles (approximately 15%), earpieces (less than 1%), necklaces (approximately 33%), longer belts or skirts with cone decoration (approximately 2%), or bangles (0%). Almost all of the headdresses and hairstyles, a few necklace types, and belt/skirt types are gendered, although these attributes are occasionally mixed on figurines (see Fig. 4, right). £} Springer</page><page sequence="14">244 Clark Fig. 6 Examples of female (and probably female) figurines from Period 1 (top left), Period 2 (bottom left), and Period 3 (center and right) from Harappa (courtesy of Harappa Archaeological Research Project and the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan, photograph by the author (©Sharri Clark)). Construction Almost all of the Indus terracotta figurines are hand-modeled and rather schematic. They are formally similar enough, despite some relative size variation (see Fig. 3), to give the impression of great uniformity but not expediency. The highly stereotyped forms of most figurines suggest that they were made according to "standard types" for the body, possibly "blessed" for a specific function and discarded, devoid of sacred or magical significance (Dales 1960: 261). However, if the terracotta figurines represent standardized bodies, why not produce more realistically detailed and uniform figurines more quickly and efficiently by using molds? £} Springer</page><page sequence="15">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 245 Harappan artisans were clearly capable of creating more realistic terracotta figurines, as an exceptional finely made (carved) terracotta monkey figurine (see Vats 1940: 304, PL LXXVIII: 35) demonstrates. They also already used molds to produce fine details in the presumably efficient and consistent production of other artifacts such as copper alloy tools and figurines, miniature faience figurine amulets, and molded tablets of terracotta and faience. Some of the terracotta and faience tablets were clearly produced using molds leaving a ridge where the molds were joined at each side (see Fig. 2). However, only one (terracotta) figurine mold has been found thus far, at the site of Mohenjo-daro, and even when it was used to mold the heads of some bull figurines, the bodies were still hand-modeled (see Kenoyer 1998: 118). Changes in other types of artifacts at Harappa in Periods 3B and 3C also appear to indicate a general concern with more efficient and consistent production of Harappan artifacts. For example, by Period 3C, there is a transition to less labor-intensive rectangular seals without any iconography and the appearance of large numbers of possibly disposable pointed base goblets, perhaps to address new problems of urbanization such as hygiene or ritual purity (Kenoyer 1998: 17; Meadow and Kenoyer 2001: 27). Earlier in Period 3B, less labor-intensive and more consistently duplicated molded faience and terracotta tablets appeared alongside the more labor- intensive individually crafted steatite tablets already being produced (Meadow and Kenoyer 2000: 4, 2001: 26-27). The trend toward efficient and consistent production of artifacts also continued after the end of the Indus Civilization in later South Asian figurines. Unlike the Harappan figurines, most terracotta figurines in the Early Historic Period (ca. 200 bc) were molded, first as individual figures and then as plaques with iconographic scenes with multiple figures, which typically had flattened and usually undecorated backsides (see Ahuja 2000). Most standing Harappan figurines also had flattened and either undecorated or carelessly finished backs (see Fig. 7, far left) as well as angled feet that would not allow them to stand on their own. Of course, some of the Harappan figurines were truly three-dimensional, which is slightly more difficult to achieve with molds. The Early Historic Period molded figurines were front-focused and effectively two-dimensional materializations that had to be supported in order to be viewed as well - presumably propped up or suspended or laid on their backs. This effective two-dimensionality may argue against most of the Harappan figurines acting as doubles or substitutes for human beings like Egyptian shabti and other magical figurines, as the Harappan bodies were rendered effectively flawed or incomplete. Nor is it likely, due to their relatively large size and incomplete dimensions, that they were handled and viewed in a variety of positions or carried around, possibly in bags, as some scholars have suggested for figurines from other sites that cannot stand or sit alone (Bailey 2005; Meskell et al 2008: 158; Knapp and Meskell 1997). Perhaps this incomplete and front-focused representation of the Harappan body simply indicates an economy of effort based on function. There was no need for finishing a part of the body that would be physically hidden. Their backs may have been pressed into some other material (e.g., embedded in plaster on a wall) or hidden from view (e.g., propped in a wall niche). This representation of the Harappan body might indicate both a functional and a societal focus on the front of the human body. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="16">246 Clark Fig. 7 A drawing (published in Dales 1991a: 66, Fig. 5.5) and photograph of a typical standing anthropomorphic female figurine head and body with a flattened back (H87-253/1 1-50), broken along the original mid-body join of two rolls (courtesy of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan; drawing and photograph by the Harappa Archaeological Research Project (©HARP)). In summary, the Harappans were: (1) clearly skilled craftspeople capable of more realistic representation than the figurines, (2) already using molds for more efficient and consistent production of other artifacts, (3) apparently generally concerned with more efficient (and possibly more consistent) production, and therefore (4) able to produce effectively two-dimensional Harappan figurines more efficiently and consistently using molds. So, why didn't the Harappans use molds to produce terracotta figurines? I suggest that the process of making Harappan figurines was as important as the figurines themselves, and hand modeling must have been both essential to the process of producing Harappan figurines and suitable for producing sufficient quantities of figurines to meet the demand. Perhaps the act of hand-modeling the figurines was ritually or symbolically important (see Clark 2007a: 110-115, 181), and more consistent and efficient production using molds would have obfuscated the original ideas or meanings of the Harappan figurines. In any case, the Harappan figurines' value and meaning seem to have been tied to the process of producing them individually - to figurines as a process. A number of archeologists have £) Springer</page><page sequence="17">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 247 explored the idea that the process of manufacturing figurines could be at least as important as the figurines themselves and focused on figurines as processes rather than things (see Clark 2007a, chapter 3; Dales 1991a; Meskell 2007; Meskell et al 2008; Nanoglou 2008b; Talalay 1993: 127, note 27). The Harappans' unusual choice to hand-model the figurines from vertical halves from head to toe (see Fig. 7) apparently extended to the (female) figurines from the earliest pre-Indus periods at Harappa. The unique manufacture of these and even earlier figurines, at least partially constructed of two vertically joined rolls of clay, suggests that this figurine tradition was indigenous to South Asia. By Period 3, the bodies of most of the standing terracotta figurines from Harappa (and some figurines depicted in other postures) were constructed from just four pieces (other than appliqued eyes, lips, and dress or ornamentation) - two pieces of clay joined vertically from the top of the head to the feet and two arms joined to the torso at the shoulders. Contrary to previous suggestions {e.g., During Caspers 1985), this construction is very different from that of some ancient Near Eastern figurines in which a head, arms, and legs were attached to a violin-shaped torso or "core" (see Clark 2007a: 173-184 for discussion). The internal tension lines of the clay at breaks along the middles of the bodies of many of the Harappan figurines indicate both that the faces were pinched out from the two joined vertical rolls of clay rather than being attached and that the legs are continuations of two rolls of clay rather than separate pieces applied to a "core". The fact that breaks occur at different points along the legs of figurines rather than consistently where the legs meet the torso also supports this conclusion. Just as ancient Egyptians considered cult statues to have been born rather than made by artisans (Meskell 2004: 90), the unusual manufacture of Harappan figurines from vertical halves may have been connected with the creation of life or birth. However, linking the process of hand modeling the figurines from Harappa from vertical halves with creation or life need not imply that they functioned as cultic figures. George Dales interpreted the physical construction of the figurines as a reflection of the Indus understanding of human anatomy, speculating that the application of separate parts (vertical halves with arms attached in a manner that imitated the human shoulder) might indicate that "ritualistic 'creation' or birth" was the reason for making the female figurines (Dales 1991a: 66-67). The process of modeling the figurines may have been both a re-enactment of the creation of life or birth and a materialization of a duality in Harappan self-perception, perhaps reflecting the integration of male and female in a more nuanced notion of sex/gender or the integration of other essential "parts" of the self in representations of the Harappan body (Clark 2007a: 181; see also Clark 2003). It is perhaps significant that this actual and symbolic integration of halves - at the point of creation or birth - would have been concealed from the viewer after further modeling of the figurine. Only eventual breakage along the vertical join line would have revealed the unusual construction from two vertically joined rolls of clay that represented the integration. Harappan figurines are almost always recovered broken, typically from non- primary contexts, which can pose challenges for classification and interpretation - including whether they might have been constructed to be broken in particular ways. Some scholars have suggested that Neolithic figurines from southeastern Europe were constructed with the idea of deliberate fragmentation {e.g., Biehl 1996, 2003; Chapman 2000; Chapman and Gaydarska 2007; Talalay 1987, 1993). This 4y Springer</page><page sequence="18">248 Clark fragmentation has been related to fractal identities (e.g., Chapman 2000) or transformation (Biehl 1996, 2003) or social contracts (Talalay 1987, 1993), as the joined halves of the lower bodies of Neolithic figurines could have functioned as contracts or tokens that were designed to be broken apart by two parties. However, other scholars have challenged the idea of deliberate fragmentation based on the fact that figurines tend to break at naturally weak points (e.g., Nanoglou 2005: 143). The joining of two rolls to form legs and a lower torso may have been simply the easiest way to construct separate legs. The Harappan figurines typically broke at different points on protruding limbs or other weak areas such as the neck or waist rather than consistently in predetermined places (Clark 2007a: 130-134), a pattern which is consistent with their final deposition in refuse and fill. All of these manufacturing choices - the use of clay as a potentially symbolic medium, hand modeling versus molding, and construction from vertically joined halves - suggest a focus on the process of manufacturing the Harappan figurines. These choices rather than more efficient and readily available means of production are deliberate and meaningful. How the Harappans chose to finish the figurines emphasizes the importance of the process of manufacturing the figurines and may suggest symbolism and possibly ritual as well. Transformational Finishes Recent research at Harappa suggests that most of the Harappan figurines were not slipped or painted. Instead, some of the pigments or slips described by early excavators on figurines and pottery at Indus sites such as Mohenjo-daro (e.g., Mackay 1938: 259-260; Vats 1940: 297-298, Plates LXXVI: 28 and LXXVII: 48) are actually the results of postdepositional processes. The whitish gypsum accretion on some figurines is a result of burial in the soil and the dark green, brown, and reddish-brown stains on others result from lying in sewage (e.g., in sump pots or along the sides of ancient streets). The fact that these so-called pigments often extend across areas of obvious breakage confirms this interpretation. In fact, less than 10% of the anthropomorphic figurines in this study had surviving traces of actual black, white, blue-green, red, or (rarely) combinations of red, brown, and purple pigments. Pigments were sometimes used to depict hair, eyes, or ornamentation and to decorate headdresses and appliqued features, ornamentation, and dress on the Harappan figurines. Black (or brownish-black) pigment on the head often seems to have represented hair, usually extending around the head and sometimes down the back to depict loose hair. Black pigment is found on some modeled bound double buns on (usually male) figurines and on other modeled hairstyles. However, the pigment often covers the fan-shaped or double volute headdresses of Harappan figurines and cup-like panniers on the sides of the head/headdress as well (see Fig. 3, center left and right). These traces of black on and inside the panniers have been interpreted as residue from burned oil or incense (Mackay 1938: 260-261) or possibly pigment derived from soot (Kenoyer 1998: 135; Meadow et al. 1994: 21). This seemingly mundane detail is actually of great significance for South Asian archeology. The untested assumptions that the black residues in (some of) the figurines' panniers were traces of burned oil or incense have been accepted as proof £) Springer</page><page sequence="19">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 249 of the long-standing interpretation that the Indus female figurines functioned as "anthropomorphic votive figures". This interpretation in turn has been accepted as proof that these figurines represented the Mother Goddess as far back as the Bronze Age - all untested ideas dating to the earliest published excavations of Indus sites (Mackay 1938: 260-261; see also Clark 2005, 2007b for discussion). None of these interpretations, which have had far-reaching implications regarding interpretations of Indus society and religion for the last 80 years, had ever been tested. The first empirical test of Harappan figurine pigments challenging these assumptions involved a compositional analysis of pigment samples from Harappan figurines (see Clark 2007a: 158-169). Table II illustrates the figurines sampled, describes the samples and the figurines' contexts, and summarizes the results of the spectrographic compositional analyses of the 13 pigment samples - 11 black pigment samples from anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines along with additional samples of white and blue-green pigment from the unusual polychrome headdress of one figurine (Table II, samples 4, 5, and 6). These analyses included Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy analysis and electron beam microprobe elemental chemical analysis conducted by the Strauss Laboratory of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, which were generally confirmed by a second analysis of the same samples by Steve Weiner of the Department of Structural Biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Spectrographic analysis showed that with the exception of samples 8 and 12 (see Table II), the black pigments are essentially the same - burned bone, sometimes called "bone black" (or "ivory black"). Samples 8 and 12, which were both from black pigment designs on red slip on (probably later Harappa phase) quadruped figurine bodies with decoration similar to Harappan pottery, were not bone black (which is slightly more granular) but rather soot black in a matrix of quartz with a trace of gypsum. The white pigment on the multicolored figurine headdress (sample 5 in Table II) was also burned bone - "bone white" or "bone ash" (calcined bone). Therefore, it appears that both the black and white pigments used to decorate figurines at Harappa were produced from burned bone rather than from minerals, although mineral pigments were used for decorated Harappan pottery (possibly iron and manganese oxide; Kenoyer 1994b: 35, 1998: 153) and they were apparently readily available. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) showed that there was no substantial difference in the fatty acids found inside the panniers of at least two figurines (Table II, samples 2 and 3) and on the figurine without panniers (Table II, sample 7). Thus, there is no evidence that incense or oils were burned in the panniers of the female figurines from Harappa, contrary to the long-standing interpretation of the female figurines as "anthropomorphic votive figures" (Mackay 1938: 260-261; see also Clark 2005, 2007b for discussion). The unusual choice of burned bone pigments to decorate the figurines rather than the readily available mineral pigments used to decorate pottery and other artifacts seems significant. It is especially striking since the visual effect of the bone and mineral pigments is essentially the same (see Fig. 8). Moreover, the only (brownish-) black or white mineral pigments on Period 3 figurines from Harappa identified by the author were found on a few later Harappa phase zoomorphic figurines. All of the black and white pigments on the Harappan anthropomorphic figurines analyzed thus far appear to be burned bone pigments.

The ancient Harappans produced a unique faience in a variety of colors, including white (from calcium), deep azure and blue-green (from copper minerals), black (from manganese), yellow, brown, and red-brown (from iron minerals), and brilliant red derived from an unknown colorant (Bhan et al. 1994, 2002: 252; also see extensive research on Indus faience by other scholars, e.g., Barthelemy de Saizieu and Bouquillon 1997; Bouquillon et al. 1995). Traces of calcium in the white faience and other Indus faience may have been due to the use of calcinated bone in faience as well (Bhan et al. 2002: 252). In Eurasia and many other parts of the world, bone is traditionally considered to be deeply symbolic and ritually significant, symbolizing the very essence of life by ritual specialists such as shamans (e.g., Chang 1986: 150). The choice of burned bone for figurine pigments may suggest a particular symbolic intimacy in their materiality. The use of bone, a substance so clearly essential to human (and animal) ^ Springer</page><page sequence="22">252 Clark Fig. 8 Zoomorphic figurines from Harappa decorated with bone and mineral pigments (courtesy of Harappa Archaeological Research Project and the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan): left a Period 2 wheeled sheep figurine from Harappa decorated with solid brownish-black bone pigment (H95-262 1/6539-1; photograph by the author (OSharri Clark)); center a very large (probably) Period 3 animal figurine partial shoulders and torso (facing right) decorated with brownish- black mineral pigment (H98/8499-26; photograph by Richard Meadow ©HARP); and right a (probably) later Period 3 zebu (humped cattle) lower body decorated with brownish-black mineral pigment over red slip (H99/83 87-52; photograph by the author (©Sharri Clark)). life, may have provided a personal connection with the figurines. If the joining of two rolls of clay symbolized dualism and "creation", perhaps the addition of ground bone pigment to the figurines imbued the figurines with special power - perhaps even "life force". The majority of the Harappan terracotta figurines were not finished or decorated with pigments, but almost all of the terracotta figurines from Harappa were well fired (or overtired) at 700 to 900°C (see Kenoyer 1994b). Although no Period 3 pottery or figurine workshops have been clearly identified at Harappa, a few (overtired or blackened) figurines have been associated with kilns, possibly the same kilns used to fire pottery at the site (Clark 2007a: 170-171; see also Dales et al 1991: 230, 235, Figs. 13.33 and 13.37). In fact, although only a few later figurines from Harappa have decoration similar to pottery decoration (see Table II, samples 8 and 12, and Fig. 8), the skill required to produce even the relatively schematic Indus figurine forms so consistently suggests that figurine specialists, who may have been potters as well, made the figurines from Harappa. Even if the Harappans viewed the figurines as a process in which hand modeling and the individual production of similar figurines were essential - when more efficient and consistent production technology was readily available - this does not explain why the figurines were fired. Scholars have noted that modeling clay is dynamic and often expedient (quick and easy) - an additive process, unlike the reductive process of grinding or carving stone - but firing the clay then profoundly transforms the raw material (e.g., Nanoglou 2008b: 318; Talalay 1993: 30-31). Firing figurines implies a desire for concretization and durability in their materialization. Thus, the Harappan figurines embody concretized codified actions by specialists - a process made relatively durable through fired clay. Although it is impossible to know for sure, each figurine might have been created with the participation of, or under the gaze of, the user and/or an audience as well. In any case, the figurine's materialization and transition into "thingness" rather than an aggregation of its constituent parts (clay, fi Springer</page><page sequence="23">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 253 pigment, etc.) represents the process of the Harappans physically engaging with their world, inserting themselves and their culture into the material world, embodying themselves and their worldview externally in the figurines - a social process shared at least to some extent by both manufacturers and users. The Harappan Figurines in Context If the Harappan figurines were materialized and concretized social and ideological processes made durable through firing, it is likely that their "lives" or "life histories" included additional roles and multiple social meanings before their final discard and deposition at the site. Terracotta figurines' potential for durability and longevity is great, especially since they are often curated and reused. Ethnographic studies suggest that even figurines made for ritual purposes may be reused as toys after their original functions are fulfilled (e.g., Siiger et al. 1991). Fully understanding the figurines' biographies as social objects requires recontextualizing the figurines - considering their archeo logical contexts and associated objects. This includes a consideration of the rich and diverse figurine corpus and the larger assemblage of material culture from Harappa, especially the other objects found in association with the figurines archeologically. Like most of the Neolithic figurines from sites across the ancient Near East, the terracotta figurines from Harappa are recovered almost exclusively from (presumably) nonprimary contexts such as refuse and fill across the site. They were apparently discarded after their primary and possibly subsequent uses - at the end of their "lives" - typically broken (or broken as a result of postdepositional processes such as trampling) along with other terracotta objects such as carts, wheels, beds, and tops, as well as seals, tablets, pottery, and bones. While this type of deposition is still useful for dating the objects and general spatial patterning, the lack of clear association with features such as floors, ritual structures (e.g., niches in temples), and/or shrines limits the information these contexts can provide about figurine use and disposition. The most common interpretation of their widespread deposition in trash or refuse is that the figurines were widely available and used by almost everyone, usually in domestic contexts or at the household level and possibly temporarily (e.g., Jarrige 1991: 92; Kenoyer 1998: 111; Mackay 1938: 259; Marshall 1931: 50). However, it seems unlikely that all of these other artifacts (especially inscribed seals and tablets) were widely available and used domestically. It is more likely that objects became mixed after they were discarded. In fact, an unexpected and significant result of the author's research at Harappa (Clark 2007a; Clark in press) is that the majority of the contextual information at Harappa - and possibly at many large urban sites in South Asia and in the ancient Near East - is of limited use in precise interpretation of the figurines' uses, as the cumulative effect of centuries of human and environmental activity such as abandonment, inalienation of possessions and collecting, reuse of architectural material (e.g., brick-robbing) and other disturbances of earlier deposits, and other taphonomic activities such as immersion in sewage and erosion have created increasingly complicated and sometimes relatively undifferentiated mixtures of archeological material in each subsequent period. The heavy disturbance of deposits 4y Springer</page><page sequence="24">254 Clark at Harappa, especially the upper levels of the site (Periods 3C and later periods), extends meters below the surface in many areas and makes the isolation and dating of the archeological material from Period 4 and later periods particularly difficult. While it is possible that some refuse contexts may provide meaningful patterns that reflect the use(s) of figurines and other artifacts, even find contexts such as refuse from areas around buildings and other features may bear little or no relation to the use of the figurines before deposition. Refuse can, for example, easily consist of mixed deposits from a number of areas deposited far away from the original source. Even today, refuse is sometimes dumped in abandoned areas or outside villages in Pakistan. At Harappa, clear evidence of dumping (often broken) artifacts along with household waste including hearth deposits over city walls and the likelihood that refuse was dumped and redistributed in different areas of the site by populations over time (e.g., the thick mixed debris over the cemeteries) may account for some of the widespread distribution of figurines and other artifacts across the site. Whether the archeological contexts of the figurines are reflections of their use and discard or simply widespread dumping of refuse is unclear. Still, the distributions of certain types of figurines correspond to the boundaries of the site in the periods in which they were being produced (see Clark 2007a). Even when considering the spatial distribution generally, there is very little difference in the distributions of different types of Harappan figurines that might indicate associations of different types of figurines with different areas of the site or segregated social groups (e.g., female figurines with fan-shaped headdresses with panniers (see Fig. 3, left center and right) versus female figurines with double volute headdresses (see Fig. 3, left)). Due to these contextual constraints, it is difficult to address how the figurines functioned in Harappan society definitively. Summary and Discussion In this paper, we have seen that material matters for the Harappans in creating the terracotta figurines, which can be viewed as a symbolic and social process through which the Harappans engaged with the world around them. Since the figurines' archeological contexts, typically garbage and fill deposits, and broad spatial distributions provide limited insights into their "life histories", the paper has focused on the figurines themselves and the beginning of their "lives" or their creation. Fortunately, the creation process involved meaningful and sometimes unusual choices in material, form and decoration, construction, and transformational finishes that provide possible insights into the figurines' "lives" and Harappan materiality. Several recent studies of human representation and materiality at sites in southeastern Europe during the Neolithic have suggested that material matters for many earlier groups and their figurines. According to Nanoglou (2005, 2008a, b), material matters in Neolithic Greece and the Balkans; the materiality of the human body in stone and in clay is different as it expresses a different subjectivity and fi Springer</page><page sequence="25">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 255 experience of being in the world. For example, Nanoglou (2005, 2008b) notes changes in the materialization of the human body from the earlier to later Greek Neolithic that may reflect a shift in subjectivities from concerns with identity and the present to concerns with substance and the past, concurrent with broader changes in the Neolithic. Nanoglou (2008a: 10) also interprets differences in human and animal representation between Neolithic Thessaly and the Balkans as evocations of different aspects of people's bodily experiences and oriented embodied selves to different notions of community - making sense of their worlds in different ways. On the other hand, one cannot say material always matters at other early sites. For example, a recent study of the figural corpus from Neolithic Qatalhoyiik (now in Turkey) suggests that material does not matter. This spatial and temporal analysis shows that the ultimate treatment, circulation, and deposition of all figurines (stone and clay) across the Neolithic site is the same, which lends weight to the idea that the inhabitants of Catalhoyuk subscribed to the broad category of "figurine" without discriminating materials or forms (Meskell et al 2008: 157). Regardless of form, most clay figurals appear to have been very commonplace everyday or "mundane" objects, disposable and mobile (Meskell et al 2008: 146, 157). However, like the situation at the later site of Harappa, these figurines have been found in refuse and fill across the entire site, so the placement of figurines in any fill may have been coincidental, especially if they were indeed circulated objects. Of course, broad comparisons over geographic distances and millennia are of limited use, as the meanings of figurines and the discourses within which they are materialized and situated are context-dependent. There must have been differences in the discourses within which the negotiation of identity and one's place in society were situated in the Neolithic and later in the often densely populated urban communities of the Bronze Age, which were connected in even more vast and complex networks of communication and exchange with new technologies. To sum up, a number of different lines of evidence indicate an Indus and Harappan focus on the creation and use of figurines as process-oriented, with ideological rather than purely functional or practical choices made throughout production. First, the figurines were hand-modeled rather than more efficiently molded, a technology that was known and used for other Indus and Harappan artifacts. Molding the figurines would have been much more efficient with more consistent results and could have easily produced a similarly two- dimensional "front-focused" product. The small unstable base provided by two joined legs with angled feet that made the figurine unable to stand on its own suggests that these figurines must have been designed to lie on their backs or to be supported. They are effectively two-dimensional objects whose backs were not meant to be viewed. The Harappans' use of molding and tendency toward more efficient, if not, "mass" production of other artifacts suggest that hand modeling the figurines was a deliberate choice. Of course, there are other possible explanations for this choice. Second, many of the figurines were modeled from two clay pieces joined vertically from head to toe rather than the simpler method of attaching head and appendages to a torso. For example, although hand modeling a standing anthropomorphic figurine by joining two rolls of clay from head to toe could have been a practical choice since the legs would have been easier to model, this is not the &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="26">256 Clark most pragmatic way to model the head or the torso. The rolls had to be securely joined and heavily manipulated to create a smooth torso and a projecting face with a headdress. Constructing many of the figurines from vertically joined halves probably symbolized a Harappan concept of duality, possibly reflecting the integration of male and female in a more nuanced notion of sex/gender or the integration of other essential "parts" of the self in representations of the Harappan body. It may be significant as well that this integration is concealed after further modeling of the figurine and only revealed through breakage along the join line. The fact that the figurines were relatively uniformly hand-modeled rather than being more efficiently and consistently produced by molding, a widely used technology, also suggests the importance of the process of individually creating likenesses of human beings. In addition, this process could not be replicated in molten metal or in stone, and although both are often considered valuable materials, perhaps neither had the same transformative potential or symbolic significance as clay. Third, the figurines were sometimes decorated with burned bone pigments rather than readily available mineral pigments used on other media such as pottery. Although burned bone pigment could have been a practical choice based upon the cheapness and ready availability of bone, the fact that mineral pigments were apparently also available, similar in appearance, and widely used for Harappan pottery suggests that the use of bone was a conscious choice in the materialization of the Harappan body based on its material and symbolic qualities. Fourth, the figurines were fired when clay figurines are often sufficient for use. Although many figurines from early societies were fired, sometimes literally "half-baked" accidentally due to proximity to hearths or other exposure to fire, unfired earth, clay, or dough figurines are often used in rituals as well, then reused or disposed of. Carefully firing the Harappan figurines not only may have served the objective of durability and longevity but also may have been related to the transformative power of firing, of changing the material properties of clay to those of terracotta. Many materials were intensively manipulated and transformed in the Indus artifact assemblage - steatite was often bleached and fired to create hard white seals and tablets, agate was sometimes partially bleached and fired to create "etched" carnelian, ground quartz sintered with alkali-lime glassy bonding material was fired to create the unique Indus "compact" faience (Bhan et al. 1994: 149; Kenoyer 1994b: 359; McCarthy and Vandiver 1991), and copper alloy was manipulated to create artifacts ranging from tools to small sculptures. Of course, pyrotechnology is transformative (see Miller 2006 for a good discussion), and other scholars have suggested that the transformation of materials such as steatite (Vidale 2000) and agate (Kenoyer et al. 1994; Roux and Matarasso 1999) by firing may have been ritually important in the Indus. In this case, the seemingly unremarkable materials, clay and bone, were transformed through modeling and firing into figurines. The special power and meaning of seemingly unremarkable materials such as these are not always readily apparent. There is rarely any evidence of their ritual or magical significance or use - or the practices involved in their materiality - in the materials that survive in the archeological record (e.g., see Schmidt, this issue). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="27">Material Matters: Representation and Materiality of the Harappan Body 257 Whatever creating the Harappan figurines and the figurines themselves may have represented, the figurines do not appear to have had permanent power or agency, as figurines were discarded along with many other objects from broken seals to animal bone in refuse at Harappa. The materials used for figurines may have been meaningful, even sacred or magical, but that material was probably not considered permanently transformed or imbued with sacred or magical properties, nor are these qualities necessarily evident in the material itself. Representations and imagery are actively engaged in the processes of people relating to their world. In the case of the Harappan figurines, material matters and the processes of manipulating material matters. The unusual construction of the Harappan figurines represents a unique Harappan materiality - a process of constructing Harappan identity and ways of being in the world. Acknowledgments I would like to thank the editors of this special edition, Lynn Meskell and Stratos Nanoglou, for inviting me to contribute and for numerous constructive suggestions on earlier drafts that helped focus the central arguments and give the paper the appropriate structure. The paper also benefited greatly from the constructive comments of Jim Skibo, Catherine Cameron, Heather Miller, and anonymous reviewers. Although this paper draws upon research presented in my dissertation, the paper allowed me to think about these data in a new way. I would like to thank my doctoral advisors C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky and Richard Meadow for their ongoing support and for reading portions of the work presented here. I'm also grateful to Steve Weiner for generously providing additional analyses of the pigment samples.
