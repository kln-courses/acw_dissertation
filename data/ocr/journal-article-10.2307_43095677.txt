Birkmaier, AV Communications , vol 23, no. 2, Feb 89, pp 14, 16, 21. Desktop video is putting video production into the hands of the proletariat. With the desktop computer, one can capture video for manipulation, or to help transfer graphics, or to generate video ani- mation. Image quality is a function of the number of pixels displayed. Color is determined by the number of bit planes for each pixel. - S.M. Shelton. HOPE REPORTS. T.W. Hope, SMPTE Journal , vol 98, no. 11, Apr 89, pp 286-287. Media communication in 1989 will be nearing $19 billion in total expenditures. The author details the dollars and cents of the profession in all its various elements. He cites audiovisual use by the various media and discusses in-house and contract production. - S.M. Shelton. HYPERMEDIA. D. Stover, Popular Science, vol 234, no. 5, May 89, pp 122-124. Hypertext came first - computer documents linked together in an associative fashion. Now sounds and pictures are spun into the in- formation web to create hypermedia - interactive programs to meld education and kinetic visuals in non-linear fashion. - S.M. Shelton. OH, NO, NOT ANOTHER FESTIVAL JURY! J. Nickel, Video Systems, vol 14, no. 12, Dec 88, pp 41, 44, 46, 50. For anyone contemplating entering an audiovisual in a competi- tion - or for anyone thinking about being a judge in such a compe- tition - Nickel offers insight into the machinations of juries, what bores them, and what excites them. Unfortunately, most audiovisuais screened are tediously dull, causing some jurors to nap from time to time. - S.M. Shelton. Communication FIVE CRITICAL CHALLENGES TO COMMUNICATING CLEARLY. K. Matějka and J. Liebowitz, Supervision, vol 50, no. 2, Feb 89, pp 9-10. From the Attila- the-Hun school of management, the authors present the five most critical challenges to communicating clearly: (1) the principle of transactional verticality, (2) the trap of tacit agreement, (3) the curse of silent communication, (4) the roadblock of reading between the lines, and (5) the problem of personality types. - J.S. Patterson. THE LATER-BASED, PRAGMATIC MODEL OF THE COM- MUNICATION PROCESS. A.S. Targowski and J. P. Bowman, Journal of Business Communication, vol 25, no. 1, Winter 88, pp 5- 24. Our society has developed a need for a new model of the com- munication process. The old models are oversimplified and exclude important processes. The Targowski-Bowman model introduces a de- tailed but easy-to-understand paradigm that incorporates all previous aspects of the communication process included in old models as well as aspects that have been previously omitted. - A.L. Hedgpeth. Computer Documentation BREAKING THE GRIP OF THE USER MANUAL. E.H. Weiss, ACM Sigdoc*, vol 14, no. 2, Summer 88, pp 4-11. The reasons why user manuals have such a grip on users: free- form procedures and routines; cryptic and ambiguous menus and options; undecipherable prompts and field names; unintelligible sys- tem/error messages; error-prone data-entry mechanisms, unhelpful help screens, and inadequate manuals. - R.J Brockmann. THE ZEN OF DOCUMENTATION. M.E. Maratta, System/ 3X &amp; AS World, vol 17, no. 4, Apr 89, pp 31-38. When developing documentation, writers should follow these guidelines: Use "you" to put the reader at the center of attention. Use unique typestyles for user input and system output. Include an index if key items are discussed in different contexts throughout the manual. Use documentation as a product design tool so that the system speaks clearly to the end unser. Develop information from the user's view- point. Leave enough white space for user's notes. - R.A. Barnes. Computer Graphics HYPERCHART: TURN COLD NUMBERS INTO HOT CHARTS AND GRAPHS. A. Laird, Macintosh Hands On, Apr 89, pp 14-29. HyperChart enables you to produce line, area, pie, bar, and stacked- bar charts on Macintosh computers. Step-by-step instructions, tips, shortcuts, and practice exercises allow you to build and test your HyperChart skills. Descriptions of the chart logic illustrate how HyperChart creates the differing types of charts. - T.A. Varga. SYSTEM SURVEY: DESKTOP SCANNERS. B. Esler, Graphic Arts Monthly, vol 61, no. 4, Apr 89, pp 95-99. Desktop scanners are used primarily to speed the capture and in- sertion of illustrations in desktop publication systems. Artists can scan illustrations into the system, clean things up, reduce them electron- ically, and then save the output on a high-resolution printer. Article evaluates capabilities of several systems and lists characteristics of a large number of others. - J.E. Mortland. Computers METAPHORS THAT UNDERMINE HUMAN IDENTITY. R. Gozzi, Jr., Et cetera, vol 46, no. 1, Spring 89, pp 48-53. "By attributing human qualities to machines, especially computers, we lose the sense of what is human, have less understanding of how humans differ from machines, and construct an image of powerful machines and frail humans." Advocates replacing anthropomorphic terms: e.g., "memory" should be "data storage capacity." - C.W. Pollard. Editing DO YOU HAVE THE PERSONALITY TRAITS THAT MAKE A GOOD EDITOR? P.S. Taylor, The Editorial Eye, vol 12, no. 5, May 89, pp 1-3. A good editor has a love of words, an interest in detail, a healthy 388 Technical Communication, Fourth Quarter 1989</page><page sequence="2">skepticism, a good memory, a love of reading and learning new things, tact, self-confidence, flexibility, a sense of proportion, a sense of humor, clarity of thought, an interest in working with other people's thoughts, and a self-effacing personality. - C.W. Pollard. Education TEXT DENSITY LEVEL AS A DESIGN VARIABLE IN IN- STRUCTIONAL DISPLAYS. G.R. Morrison, S.M. Ross, and J.K. O 'Dell, Educational Communication and Technology , vol 36, no. 2, Summer 88, pp 103-115. Students learned as much from concise narrative (low-density) text as from conventional (high-density) text, and learned more quickly from the former. Students using printed matter finished lessons more quickly and learned better than did those getting lessons through computer-based instruction. - P. Harris. Employment RÉSUMÉ CONTENT PREFERENCES OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES. J. Harcourt, A.C. Krizan, and G. Gordon, Business Education Forum , vol 43, no. 5, Feb 89, pp 34-36. Research indicates a change in preferred content from a 1984 study. Employers look more for previous achievements, special aptitudes/ skills, work-related learning, contributions, grade-point average, and willingness to relocate. They are not interested in personal informa- tion, most high school data, health, personal references, and lists of college courses taken. - R. Reaves. Graphics AN ANALYSIS OF GRAPHIC USE IN AUDIO-GRAPHIC TELECONFERENCES. L.R. Smeltzer and C.M. Vance, Journal of Business Communication , vol 26, no. 2, Spring 89, pp 123-141. A field study showed significant differences among teleconferences having no graphics, those where the graphics did not directly com- plement the audio message, and those where the graphics directly complemented audio messages. A higher number of graphics that complemented audio messages did not result in significant improve- ments. Individual differences were not an interacting effect. Perceived quality of graphics was significantly related to perceived effectiveness of the teleconference. - W.E. Stephenson. Information Handling COMPUTER AIDED RESEARCH NOTES. D.S. Hartley III, Bui- letin of ASIS, vol 15, no. 4, Apr/ May 89, pp 22-24. The Research Notes System (RNS) is a set of personal computer programs and databases designed to aid researchers in gathering, mon- itoring, and using notes taken from the literature. Article describes the system's operations, characteristics, and capabilities. - J.E. Mortland. HYPERTEXT: BEHIND THE HYPE. A.F. Bevilacqua, American Libraries , vol 20, no. 2, Feb 89, pp 158-162. Discusses the history and current and future applications of hy- pertext. When perfected, the electronic hypertext document will elim- inate the frustrations of using encyclopedias, card catalogs, citation indexes, and abstracts. Reference material or cited information will be available instantly and heuristically through the non-sequential, computerized text-retrieval system called hypermedia. - M.H. and R.D. Slick. A SEARCH-AND-DESTROY MISSION- AGAINST PAPER. F. Seghers, Business Week , no. 3090, 26 Feb 89, pp 91, 95. Describes the problems the Defense Department faces in managing hundreds of tons of manuals, reports, engineering drawings, etc. The government has mounted a $1 billion program, Computer-aided Ac- quisition and Logistics Support, to create a "paperless Pentagon." The program plans to reduce by 20% the $5 billion that the Pentagon spends each year for managing technical data on weapons. - L. Beason. Information Services ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS: YOUR ON-LINE ANSWER LINE. S. Wolpin, Today* s Office, vol 23, no. 10, Mar 89, pp 62-64, 70. "You can have access to the largest library in the world right from your PC." Promotes the use of on-line information systems to locate bibliographic references and full-text data, as professional librarians have been doing for years. Now the search strategies and capabilities are more user-friendly with menus and gateways, helping to lower search costs and make it easier to find information without extensive training. Lists on-line database service vendors. - M.E. Silva. THE LONE CONSULTANT. E.M. Beavers, Chemtech, vol 18, no. 5, May 88, pp 264-266. Describes opportunities for one-person consulting outfits that spe- cialize in information retrieval for small chemical firms. Highlights the importance of this service to the industry and the wide-open state of the information market. - J. Bel lis. SCIENCE AND THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. B. Dixon, Scholarly Publishing, vol 20, no. 1, Oct 88, pp 3-12. Discusses the convenience and value of information systems, and our ease or unease in using them. Electronic media may make profes- sional conferences obsolete.

Perhaps we are poised for a publishing revolution, if not an electronic one. - J.S. Patterson. International Communication A COMPARISON OF AMERICAN AND FRENCH BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE. I.L. Varner, Journal of Business Commu- nication , vol 25, no. 4, Fall 88, pp 55-65. France and America show similarities and differences in business correspondence. Both countries advocate clarity and reader adapta- tion. In France, letters tend to be more formal, more abstract, less concise, and less concerned with minimizing price and presenting negative news positively. Legal considerations cause shunning of su- perlatives and exaggerations. Format is different, particularly in the inside address, salutation, and signature block. - W.E. Stephenson. IT'S ALMOST THE SAME LANGUAGE. S.H. Mayer, Righting Words , vol 3, no. 2, Mar/ Apr 89, pp 8-12. Advice for freelancers editing manuscripts for British markets. Rec- ommends British Magazine of the Month Club and Fowler's Modern British Usage. Notes inconsistent British use of single and double quotation marks, different measurements and numbers, and different cultures (e.g., no Thanksgiving or Fourth of July). - C.W. Pollard. Management ANALYZING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. Journal of Documentation Project Management, Winter 89, pp 5-10. When a product is changed, the documentation project planner analyzes how those changes affect documentation. The planner de- termines the types of documentation needed for the use, distribution, installation, and support of the product; designs the content and format of the required text; evaluates the effects of product changes; and coordinates the resources and schedules required for the project. - T.A. Varga. SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING COLLABORATIVE WRITING PROJECTS. S.B. Scott, The Editorial Eye , vol 12, no. 3, Mar 89, pp 1-3. Successful collaborative writing involves defining the team type: horizontal, vertical, or lateral; appointing a leader, ensuring that, at the start, all members know the document's purpose, audience, main message, format, and timetable. Good leaders recognize and deal with fears, expectations, and characteristics of the group. - C.W. Pollard. Micropublishing INSIGHTS ON PAGEMAKER 3.0. K. Baumann, Macworld, vol 5, no. 12, Dec 88, pp 63, 66, 70, 74, 80. This collection of tips and techniques suggested by professional Pagemaker users won't replace your documentation, but it may guide you through the maze of new features and hasten your proficiency with the new version of this desktop publishing program that was first introduced in 1985. - J.S. Patterson. THE 25 WORST DESKTOP PUBLISHING MISTAKES (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM). R.C. Parker, PC I Computing, vol 2, no. 5, May 89, pp 87-91. The 25 mistakes fall into three categories: page layout, typography, and graphics. Layout problems arise from failure to follow a grid (the lines that define text placement). Typography errors most frequently result from not building in contrasts in textual appearance, from spac- ing erratically, and from overusing boldface and italics. Sophisticated graphics capabilities can overwhelm untrained users, resulting in overdecoratcd or unbalanced visual effects. - F.S. Ponick. THE WORKSTATION ADVANTAGE. D. Brombert, Publish ! vol 3, no. 12, Dec 88, pp 44-48. Personal computers may not match all our publishing tasks. Unix workstations, with their formidable networking, might be the next step. - R.J. Brockmann. Oral Presentations PICTURE-PERFECT PRESENTATIONS. V. Johnson, Training and Development Journal, vol 43, no. 5, May 89, pp 45-47. Studies indicate that visuals make presentations 43 percent more persuasive and increase retention by about 10 percent. Most effective uses of visuals: to open presentations with an attention-getting title or image, to guide group thinking, to emphasize key points rather than every sentence, to make comparisons, to show relationships, and to clarify new concepts. Includes guidelines for creating effective visuals. Emphasizes the impact of color. - R. Reaves. PRESENTATION POWER. S. Watzman, ITC Desktop , vol 1, no. 1, Mar/ Apr 89, pp 32-41. The six steps to power presentations include planning (orga- nize thoughts); pacing (arrange logical sequences); translating (find appropriate images); designing (be tasteful and elegant); illustrating (examine resources); and producing (use desktop tools for ease). Par- ticular attention should be paid to design, for which a profesional consultant is recommended to analyze overall presentation needs. - F.S. Ponick. Reading SPECIAL ISSUE ON READING. A.H. Duin, Editor, Technical Writing Teacher, vol 15, no. 3, Fall 88, pp 155-243. Five articles focus on how people read, which affects how writers analyze target audiences and design assignments, textbooks, essays, tutorials, on-line help, and user manuals. In How People Read : Im- plications for Writers, A.H. Duin describes how readers process in- formation when they read, how readers influence their own learning, and how technical writers can influence readers. In Current Theory and Research on What Constitutes Readable Expository Text, W.H. Slater provides an empirically based definition of good expository text and highlights studies on two text features - structure and inter- estingness - that significantly affect readers' comprehension. In Studying Writer-Reader Interactions in the Workplace, R. Spilka pre- sents an ethnographic study of six engineers' composing processes. In Reading to Learn to Do, J.C. Redish describes the development of tutorials that help both readers and users to use a computer program and to learn. In Writing Reader-Based Instructions: Strategies to Build Coherence, P. Mulcahy explicates theories of coherence so that technical writers can make conscious choices about how to make task instructions clear, coherent, and comprehensible. - W.E. Stephenson. Research WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A RESEARCH COMMUNITY. Rhetoric Review, vol 7, no. 2, Spring 89, pp 223-293. Presents the plenary addresses from the "Research Network" sym- posium at the 1988 Conference on College Composition and Com- munication. C. Bazerman, P. Bizzell, R. Connors, L. Faigley, G. Hillocks, K. Schriver, C. Geisler, and S. Jarratt discuss issues im- portant to teachers and researchers in technical communication: e.g., cultural criticism, rhetorical history, linguistics, interdisciplinary stud- ies, empirical scholarship, and other themes meriting additional at- tention. - G.D. Meyers. Rhetoric THE ANCIENT RHETORICAL SUASORIA VERSUS THE MODERN TECHNICAL CASE. R.Shenk, Rhetoric Review, vol 7, no. 1, Fall 88, pp 113-127. 390 Technical Communication, Fourth Quarter 1989</page><page sequence="4">The educational value of the modern technical writing case is val- idated by pointing out its grounding in the principles of the declam- atory exercise of classical rhetoric known as the suasoria , which involved students in role-playing. - G.D. Meyers. Science Writing THE HIGH COST OF HYPE. D. Nelkin, Et cetera, vol 45, no. 3, Fall 88, pp 262-271. The alliance between scientists and journalists is both beneficial and harmful. Journalists get stories; scientists, support. But journalists can be manipulated. They do not scrutinize scientific statements and may polarize, popularize, and personalize scientists' work. The Na- tional Association of Science Writers, the Council for the Advance- ment of Science Writing, and the Media Resource Service of the Scientists' Institute for Public Information may help. - C.W. Pollard. PUBLICATION BIAS: LOOKING FOR MISSING DATA. I. Pe- terson, Science News , vol 135, no. 1,7 Jan 89, p 5. Publication bias - the phenomenon in which studies with positive results are more likely to be published than studies with negative or inconclusive results - is a serious problem in interpretation of sci- entific research, as it may make the overall picture appear rosier than is justified by all available evidence. Abstraction of summary data from published reports is potentially misleading. Statisticians should pay more attention to this phenomenon, which many know of, but few have given serious attention. - J.S. Patterson. Teaching LINGUISTIC SEXISM IN BUSINESS WRITING TEXTBOOKS. E. Neilsen, Journal of Advanced Composition , vol 8, no. 1 &amp; 2, 1988, pp 55-65. Analysis of 14 textbooks on business writing indicates that pub- lishers and authors are not providing comprehensive instruction for avoiding sexist language. Of these texts, four mention nothing about sexist language, and those that do often lack adequate coverage of issues such as sexist language in direct quotations, sex-role stereo- typing, and generic use of "he" and "man." - L. Beason. PEER EVALUATION IS EFFECTIVE IN WRITING COURSE. B.J. Pitts, Journalism Educator , vol 43, no. 2, Summer 88, pp 84- 88. Discusses three approaches to grading and enhancing student feed- back in writing classes. Peer evaluation, grading grids, and source questionnaires contain criteria that evaluate the student's work. Peer groups read the story instead of editing it. Grading grids show the student what is expected in all assignment areas. Source evaluation surveys the interviewee and is evaluated by the instructor. Result: student feedback, less grading time for instructor. - B. Harris. TEACHING AND LIVING IN CHINA: EXPERIENCES OF AN AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNICATION TEACHER IN SHANGHAI. M. Brandenburg, Bulletin of Association for Business Communication, vol 51, no. 3, Sep 88, pp 31-32. Discusses the author's teaching and living experiences in China. The article is organized according to the four stages of the cultural adaptation process: (1) the "how quaint" period, (2) the "irritation" period, (3) the "adjustment" period, and (4) the "acceptance and enjoyment" period. - H. Smith. TOWARD COMPETENT WRITING IN THE WORKPLACE. R.H. Has well, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, vol 18, no. 2, 1988, pp 161-173. Recommends changes in traditional methods of teaching technical writing in college. Suggests more attention be paid to several general writing skills: compression of meaning, fluency of expression, effi- ciency in techniques of coherence, expandability of organization and syntax, and rhetorical maneuverability and adaptability. - J.S. Boudreaux. Training BEATING THE CLOCK: TIME TO REVIEW TIME-MAN- AGEMENT TRAINING. G. English, Training and Development Journal, vol 43, no. 1, Jan 89, pp 77-79. If time-management training programs focus on tips and techniques, they will fail to make significant changes in the way people work. "Time management" is actually "self management"; effective training programs must focus on the way people think about themselves, their work group, and their role in performing tasks. - R. Reaves. IT'S SO TECHNICAL I HAVE TO LECTURE. M M. Broadwell, Training, vol 26, no. 3, Mar 89, pp 41-44. Explodes myths about training by the lecture method. Detailed lectures on highly technical topics don't equate to learning. Teach trainees how to find information in a manual. Work them through indexes, cross-references, content pages. Let subgroups work out practical problems. Presents a "miniglossary" of methods that help technical instructors to teach. - J. A. Haines, Jr. THE LEARNING ENTERPRISE. A. P. Carnevale, Training and Development Journal, vol 43, no. 2, Feb 89, pp 26-33. The American Society for Training and Development's two-year study of training in the United States points out present shortcomings, citing statistics on employees, employers, and types of training. With- out a greater commitment to training and development, "the United States may be facing a growing human-capital deficit that threatens our competitiveness, our ability to provide work for every able-bodied citizen, and the nation's security." - R. Reaves. Are foreign clients getting your message? To be sure they do, turn to experts in foreign-language business communications.

Barke, Publish! vol 3, no. 11, Nov 88, pp 35-41. Although the historical significance of Bodoni may outweigh its current usefulness, for certain applications it is unsurpassed and war- rants consideration. - R.J. Brockmann. THE TYPE CRAFTSMAN IN THE COMPUTER ERA. S. Stone, Print , vol 43, no. 2, Mar/ Apr 89, pp 84-91, 142. The use of computers enables the modern type craftsman to create new typefaces that meet the needs of the current printing world. Adobe Systems describes how they are incorporating old-world design tech- niques with new computer technology, such as PostScript, scanners, and high-resolution printers, to produce unique, functional type. - T.A. Varga. Writing COMMENTARY: THE MYTH OF THE TECHNICAL AUDI- ENCE. J.M. Moxley, Journal of Technical Writing and Communi- cation, vol 18, no. 2, 1988, pp 107-109. Article presents six internal dialogs that writers imagine while com- posing material for a fictitious audience. - J.S. Boudreaux. DOES CLIO HAVE A PLACE IN TECHNICAL WRITING? CONSIDERING PATENTS IN A HISTORY OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION. R.J. Brockmann, Journal of Technical Writ- ing and Communication, vol 18, no. 4, 1988, 297-304. For various reasons that the author suggests, technical writers need a historical perspective on matters such as style and writing standards. A good source for such perspective is the 200-year-old federal col- lection of patents. Largely the work of ordinary 19th-century me- chanics, this collection truly reflects technical (not legal, business, or science) writing of earlier eras. - W.E. Stephenson. THE INFORMATION MATRIX: TAKING THE TROUBLE OUT OF TECHNICAL WRITING. C.B. Fedler and J.M. Gregory, Engineering Education, vol 78, no. 11, Dec 88, pp 183-185. Offers a 3 X 3 writing matrix to assist in writing about technical topics. Suggests ways the matrix is especially helpful in organizing when multiple authors are involved. The matrix's nine blocks identify three main goals: capture the reader's attention (by title, abstract, introduction), present a body of information (by showing purpose, development, results), and present an organized conclusion (by con- clusions, summary, references). - W.E. Stephenson. TECHNICAL WRITING'S ROOTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE: THE EVOLUTION FROM TECHNICIAN TO TECHNICAL WRITER. H.N. Shirk, Journal of Technical Writing and Commu- nication, vol 18, no. 4, 1988, pp 305-323. Summarizes some historical trends in computer software technol- ogy, their contribution to the field of technical writing, and their implications for the current technical communicator. As a basis for investigation, the article examines several traditional assumptions re- garding the study of historical records - redefining them in terms of the cultural environment of the computer software technology. Asserts that histories of both trends closely parallel. - J.S. Boudreaux. WRITING IN ACADEME; WRITING AT WORK: USING VI- SUAL RHETORIC TO BRIDGE THE GAP. E. Tebeaux, Journal of Teaching Writing, vol 7, no. 2, Fall/ Winter 88, pp 215-236. Lack of knowledge about the value and importance of visual rhetoric may be a major reason for much "bad" writing employees currently generate on the job. Teaching employee- writers techniques of visual rhetoric can dramatically improve their writing and eliminate a number of problems. Composition faculties need to consider ways, such as instruction in visual design, to make basic composition instruction more relevant to writing needs on the job. - J.S.
