Berkeley, etc. : University of California Press, [1973]. $20. (English agents: IBEG Ltd. ?9.50.) The Lega, who live in the eastern part of the Zaire Republic, have produced some of the finest ivory carvings in Africa: in part- icular miniature statuettes of people and animals, anthropomorphic spoons, and small masks. The ownership of these carvings was the prerogative of high-ranking initiates of the bwami association, which-until it was prohibited by a Belgian decree in 1947- contained about 80% of all adult Lega males; there was also a women's branch. Daniel Biebuyck's field-work was done between 1951 and 1954. 'By the time of my research the bwami association and its members had been misunderstood, harassed and per- secuted for at least two-thirds of a century. The great artists of the Lega tradition ... were dead long before the period of my research ...' (p. 226). Equally, the best ivory pieces had begun to disappear into art collections in Europe and America, so that the people themselves were often reduced to using mass- produced substitutes in their ceremonies. The author has studied Lega culture in far greater depth than anyone before him. To support his interpretations, he collected a large store of oral literature, including more than 7,000 aphorisms, and the book is rich in descriptions of the many bwami rites that he observed. This is one of the most detailed and convincing studies of an African society for whom art (in a functional sense) was a central preoccupation. GUY ATKINS</page></plain_text>
