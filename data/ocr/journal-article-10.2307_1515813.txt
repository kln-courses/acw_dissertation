<plain_text><page sequence="1">"AyLoq IN THE SEPTUAGINT, AND ITS RELATION TO THE HEBREW ORIGINAL BY HENRY S. GEHMAN Princeton The root qddas (holy) suggests the idea of separation in that a person or a thing is withheld from ordinary or profane use and conse- quently treated with special care or consideration, dedicated to the Divine, or devoted to sacred purposes. An object is set apart not only in a negative sense, but also in a positive one, inasmuch as it is treated as belonging to the divine sphere. In this sense qddas and its derivatives may be applied to God, to persons associated with the sanctuary, or to various objects connected with worship. This usage is taken over by the LXX and adequately represented by Greek, MYL&amp;dco, xyLx'apa , ayICj 'yL YLocv , yyLor pov , Yayoo, yv. In this article, however, only the word ayLo¢ will be considered. While &amp;yLoS in the LXX is the rendering of qddas in various forms, it may also in a free translation represent other Hebrew words, of which the most important examples may be noted. 'El (God). In Sirach xliii 10 (11) bidbar 'el: G reads iv X6yoS &amp;yLou (in the words of the Holy One); Sirach xlvii 8 (9) 1,e / 'el 'yn: &amp;yicw uiatcx (to the Holy One, the Most High); in Sirach xlviii 20 (22), where I. LEVI restores YHWH, G reads 6 &amp;yLo; (the Holy One). 'elobhm (God). Jer. iii 21, "They have forgotten YHWH 'elohheem: G 0eou 'AyLou ox¥CUC ; Is. lx 9 sem YHWH 'elohayk: G To ¥vo~oc KupLou To &amp;ylov, where the adjective is substituted for 'elohaj,ik. In Lev. xviii 21, in order to avoid identification of 'elohim with pagan gods, sem 'eloheka is translated To ovopoc To &amp;yLov. hda'ron (the ark). In 2 Ch. v 9 this is rendered by a neuter plural, tr oyLoc (the holy place, i.e., the nave). In this passage there is a Hebrew variant haqqode, which is found in MT 1 Kings viii 8. bad (pl., sticks, staves [for carrying the ark]). The word apparently by popular etymology was derived from bddad (separate) and under- Vetus Testamentum IV 22</page><page sequence="2">HENRY S. GEHMAN stood in the sense of 'parts', 'separate parts', 'parts sticking out', whence the rendering TO&amp; ylo (sacred staves), 1 Kings viii 7; with this translation may be compared zt Yloatevac in the same sense, which occurs twice in the following verse as a rendering of habbaddim. bad (linen). This word has the etymological meaning 'part', whence 'piece of cloth', from which was developed the sense of 'linen', 'linen garments', as in Ezek. x 6f., where it is rendered rxToXY ayitc. barar (Hiph., purify, cleanse) occurs in the infinitive, Jer. iv 11, where it is rendered es &amp;yLov (unto what is holy), with the concept of separation and purification. hod (majesty, splendor). Sirach 1 11 (12), ba'dloto 'al migbe(a)h hod (in his going up to the altar of majesty); G renders freely: iv wvapaosle OuaLoca(7pLou yiLou. tebzl (dominion). 2 Ch. vi 2, baniti bet ,ebzl ldk; in the parallel ebf7l was understood as 'dwelling', and accordingly G gave a theolog- ical interpretation: olxoa6po7xa oxov Tx) ovO6 c TL aou YLov 6OL, where the idea of God's dwelling in the Temple is removed by the insertion of Cx o6v6aoCiL Cou and ,ebl is rendered ayLov. tdhor (clean, i.e., ceremonially), as applied to a clean place where sacrifices are eaten, is rendered &amp;ayLo, Lev. x 14, v Tx06t &amp;yic. tob (good). In Ps. cxlii (cxliii) 10 the rz(a)h of God is referred to as tobdh; this is freely rendered xO 7rvUi'oc cou TO &amp;yyov. yattir (Aramaic, 'surpassing'). In Dan. v 12 rui(a)h yattirdh (sur- passing spirit, i.e., preeminent ability) is freely rendered tvrsuio &amp;YLyov. maqom (place). In Is. xxvi 21 G freely translates this To &amp;YLov (holy place, i.e., Heaven). nadir (one consecrated, Nazirite). When G renders this by &amp;y0loq, it is to be taken as a noun, since it is modified by a genitive. In Jdg. xvi 17 n,zJr 'elohim is rendered &amp;yLoq 0eou and is to be understood in the same sense as the Hebrew. In Jdg. xiii 7 the same Hebrew com- bination is rendered &amp;ylov 0eou, neuter in agreement with the sub- ject To 0xraC0cplov, but it is a noun with the same meaning as the Hebrew. neger (sign of consecration). In Lev. xxi 12 neier semen is rendered -Tb &amp;yIov XaLIov (the holy oil), where the Greek reflects the idea of sep- aration inherent in neger. In Zech. ix 16 'abne nzeer (stones of a crown) is rendered XL0oL oyLoL (holy stones), which again suggests the sense of separation in nezer. In line with this development, Symmachus, 338</page><page sequence="3">"AyLoS IN THE SEPTUAGINT 2 Kings xi 12, rendered hannjeer (the crown) by To &amp;yLov, which is to be interpreted as 'the crown'. sabd' (pl., hosts). In Is. xiv 27 YHWH sba'ot is rendered freely 6 60E6 6 ayLo. sdpan (Qal. passive participle, 'treasured'). In Ps. lxxxii (lxxxiii) 4, where sepunekd (thy treasured ones) refers to God's saints, G renders freely o£L yLoL Cou. qdseh (severe, relentless). In Is. xxvii 1 this adjective describes the sword of YHWH. By a theological interpretation G read qdsdh as qe,dodh, whence Y pZeXMLpXa Y a¥yta. sagab (Niphal, be exalted). In Is. xxxiii 5 nisgdb YHWH by a free translation is rendered eyToS 6o 0e6c. At this point consideration will be given to words derived from the root qddas, which naturally is the most important word in this discussion. qddos (sacred, holy). This is rendered by the adjective ocyos. It is used in connection with a place in the court of the tent of meeting, Ex. xxix 31; Lev. vi 16 (9), 26 (19), 27 (20); vi 36 (vii 6); xvi 24; with the Temple, Ps. lxiv (lxv) 5; a place in the ideal Temple, Ezek. xlii 13; the camp of Israel, Deut. xxiii 14 (15); the first of Tishri, when Ezra read the Law, Neh. viii 9-11; the Sabbath as holy to God, Is. lviii 13; the words of God, Job. vi 10; the nation of Israel, a people of God, Ex. xix 6; Num. xv 40; xvi 3; Deut. vii 6; xiv 21; xxvi 19; Hos. xi 12 (xii 1); the remnant, Is. iv 3; a Nazirite, Num. vi 5, 8; the Levites, priests, Num. xvi 5, 7; the name of God, Ps. xcviii (xcix) 3; cx (cxi) 9; God and the people, Lev. xi 44 bis.; xix 2 bis; God and priest, Lev. xxi 6-8; angels, Job v 1; God, Josh. xxiv 19; Ps. xcviii (xcix) 5, 9; Is. v 16; vi 3 ter; Ezek. xxxix 7. In G, however, &amp;yLoo for qddio is also used as a noun. In Eccl. viii 10 mdqom qddos (the reading of many mss.), referring to the Temple, is rendered Tb e&amp;yLov, which is to be translated 'the Temple'. In Ps. cv (cvi) 16 Aaron is called 6 &amp;yLoq KupLou; cf. also Sirach xlv 6 (7). An angel is referred to as 6 ayLoS, Dan. viii 13 bis. In Is. lvii 15 &amp;eyLoS (+ sv &amp;ytoLq) is a name of God. He is also known as 6 &amp;yLoS (the Holy One): 1 Sam. vi 20; Hab. i 12; iii 3; Is. xl 25; xliii 15; Sirach iv 14 (15); the Holy One of Jacob, Is. xxix 23; the Holy One of Israel, 2 Kings xix 22; Ps. lxx (lxxi) 22; lxxvii (lxxviii) 41; lxxxviii (lxxxix) 19; Is. i 4; v 19, 24; x 20; xii 6; xvii 7; xxx 12, 15; xxxi 1; xxxvii 23; xli 20; xliii 3, 14; xlv 11; xlvii 4; xlviii 17; xlix 7; lv 5; lx 9, 14; Jer. xxvii (1) 29. 339</page><page sequence="4">HENRY S. GEHMAN The use of the plural of ayLto is especially noteworthy. In Ps. xxi (xxii) 4 qddos (holy) refers to God; G, however, places the Hebrew preposition b before the neuter plural of &amp;yLo, which accordingly must be interpreted as 'Temple': Cu 8e iv ay'iot xcTOLtxzS. For the use of &amp;yLoc (neuter plural) in the sense of 'Temple', cf. the ren- derings of miqdds, infra. For oL a&amp;yLo as 'saints', cf. Ps. xv (xvi) 3; xxxiii (xxxiv) 10; Zech. xiv 5; as 'saints' under persecution, Dan. vii 25; viii 24. The term o[ &amp;yLoL also denotes angels: Job xv 15; Ps. lxxxviii (lxxxix) 6, 8; Sirach xlii 17. A Hebraism, moreover, is transferred to the Greek in the form of the plural of majesty; in Pr. ix 10; xxiv 26 (xxx 3) a&amp;yLo means (the) 'Holy One' (God) and should not be translated as a plural. By a literalism G renders qedosim as ayLoL. In Is. xli 16, biqedoyisrd'el G read qedos as a plural construct, whence ev Tos ay¥oS 'I&lt;pap=X: in this case Symmachus emends to the singular, ev Txx y¥cp 'IapaX. In Jer. xxviii (li) 5, miqq,dosyisrdel, G likewise read q,edo as a plural construct, whence oarc Txav ayLov 'IpapjX; again this must be under- stood as a plural of majesty. qddas (to be set apart, consecrated, hallowed). In the Piel it means 'to consecrate'. In Ex. xxviii 3 the Piel infinitive was read as qodes (apartness, holiness, place set apart, sanctuary) and rendered sc, To &amp;yLov, meaning either 'for holiness' or 'for the sanctuary'. The Hiphil signifies 'to set apart as sacred', but in 1 Ch. xxvi 28 kol hahiqdil is freely rendered T( ayloc (holy things) + Toi 0Oeo. The Hithpael means 'to consecrate oneself'; in 2 Ch. xxx 24 yitqaddesu kohdnim was read as 'et qodse hakkjhdnzm and rendered ra ayLoa Tc v Lpecov (the holy offerings of the priests). In 2 Ch. xxxv 6 w,hitqaddesi wehdkinu was read as wv't qoddaimb haqmu and rendered ta &amp;yLa. iTroLaoGraT (and the holy offerings prepare). In other words, this Hebrew verb has nowhere been rendered as a verb in G. qaddis (Aramaic, holy; plural, holy ones, saints). As an adjective &amp;ayLo is applied in G to the people of God, Dan. vii 27; Theodotion uses it in connection with the spirit of God, Dan. iv 5f., 15; and v 11 (AQ). As a noun in the plural `ytoL means 'saints', G Dan. vii 18, 21, 22 bis, 25; and in Theodotion, vii 27. In Theodotion, Dan. iv 10, 14, 20 &amp;yLo4, ayLoL denote angel(s) as 'holy one(s)'. miqdda (sanctuary). As a translation of miqdas, 'sanctuary' in a general sense, the neuter plural TrO ayLa is used, probably in a collec- tive sense with the connotation of the building and all pertaining thereto, or perhaps originally with the force of an abstraction. 340</page><page sequence="5">"AyLoq IN THE SEPTUAGINT This use of r&amp;a yLoa to be understood as 'sanctuary' in the general sense is found in Lev. xix 30; xx 3; xxvi 2; Num. xix 20 + xcu. When miqdds refers to the tabernacle, it is rendered -ro ayyov in Lev. xxi 23; the plural, however, occurs more frequently: Lev. xxi 12; Num. x 21; xviii 1; Sirach xlv 42 (30), and apparently with no difference of meaning. The holy of holies (Lev. xvi 33) in the tabernacle (miqdds haqqodes) is called ro ay&amp;Lv -rou oyLou. Referring to the Temple, hammiqdds is rendered ra oyLta: 2 Ch. xxix 21; Ezek. v 11; viii 6; ix 6; xxiii 38f.; xxiv 21; xxv 3. The neuter plural is also used to denote rooms (miqdasim) in the Temple, Jer. xxviii (li) 51 as well as the Temple and its precincts (miqddJim), Ezek. xxi 2 (7). In the case of the ideal Temple of Ezekiel, the singular (o ay&amp;tov) is found in Ezek. xlv 4, 18; xlviii 8, but the plural (-ra oyyL) in Ezek. xxxvii 26, 28; xliii 21; xliv 1, 5, 7-9, 11, 15f.; xlvii 12; xlviii 10; this plural has to be under- stood in the sense of 'Temple'. Private sanctuaries (miqddJim) are denoted by the neuter plural (-ra oyLa), Nu. xxvi 31; Ezek. vii 24. The Temple as a fortified place (miqdds), Dan. xi 31, is b ayLtov. qodes (apartness, sacredness, holiness). This is rendered by the adjective ayLoq (holy), and its uses fall into the following scheme: I. Positive. A. &amp;yLoq, adjective. 1. modifying or referring to nouns denoting time and sacred seasons: a) holy day in general, Neh. x 31 (32) b) Sabbath day, Ex. xxxi 14 (cf. xxxv 2); Neh. ix 14; Is. lviii 13; convocation on Sabbath, Lev. xxiii 3; rest on Sabbath, Ex. xvi 23; xxxi 15 c) Passover, feast of unleavened bread, first day, Ex. xii 16; convocation on first day, Lev. xxiii 7; Num. xxviii 18; convocation on seventh day, Ex. xii 16; Lev. xxiii 8 d) Pentecost, convocation, Lev. xxiii 21; Num. xxviii 26 e) New Year, convocation, Lev. xxiii 24; Num. xxix 1 f) Day of Atonement, convocation, Lev. xxiii 27; Num. xxix 7 g) Feast of Tabernacles, first day, convocation, Lev. xxiii 35; Num. xxix 12; eighth day, convocation, Lev. xxiii 36 h) set feasts, convocations, Lev. xxiii 2, 4, 37 i) year of Jubilee, neuter adjective in agreement with ro £Toq, Lev. xxv 12 k) fruit of trees in fourth year dedicated to God, Lev. xix 24. 2.

The Hebrew superlative qodes qoddJim (holiness of holinesses, holy of holies) is taken over literally into the Septuagint. The treatment of this superlative may be thus analyzed. A. adjective. 1. neuter a) singular, aylov ayiov (most holy), modifying or referring to nouns as follows: something devoted to God (&amp;avasoac &amp;ylov ayLcov, Lev. xxvii 28; incense, aylov r&amp;v ayLov, Ex. xxx 36. In connection with the altar two forms are used: cytov Trou ayLou, Ex. xxix 37; &amp;ayov 'rv aylov, Ex. xxx 10; xl 9 (10). b) The plural &amp;ayLa rTov ayiov may refer to the Tabernacle and holy objects within it, Ex. xxx 29; &amp;ayLa ayLov refers to the limits of the territory of the Temple of Ezekiel, Ezek. xliii 12. 2. The expression qodes'haqqoddaim (the holy of holies, i.e., the inner sanctuary) is rendered as a masculine adjective in 2 Ch. iii 10: 6 oixoS ayLocq Tov ayLov (the most holy place). B. The uses of this expression as a noun are rather extensive. 1. Here comes the meaning of 'sacrifice' or 'offering'. I. singular a) qodes haqqoddsim (the holiness of holinesses, the holy of the holies). According to Ezra ii 63 deposed or illegitimate priests were not to partake of 6o a&amp;yLov Q )V ayoyv (the most holy [offering]). b) qodes haqqoddaim. According to Neh. vii 65 priests without proper genealogy were not to partake of -o aylov T-jv ayLov (the most holy [offering]). c) qJdes qoddsim (holiness of holinesses, holy of holies) rendered as ayLov &amp;yLov (most holy [offering]), is applied to the portion of land as an oblation for the priests, Ezek. xlviii 12; in Lev. xxiv 9 Symmachus makes it refer to the shewbread. The ren- dering aylov z&amp;v &amp;ayLv refers to the meal offering in Lev. ii 3. II. 1. The G uses the plural where the nomen regens in MT is in the singular, qjdqodesiqo im (holiness of holinesses, holy of holies). a) &amp;yLoc -j:v &amp;ayiOv (most holy [offerings]) refers to the meal offering, Lev. ii 10, and to the shewbread, Lev. xxiv 9 b) q6des haqqoddsim (&amp;ayLo Tr&amp;v oayuv) in MT 1 Ch. vi 49 (34) refers to the sanctuary, but G transfers it to sacrifices as a holy service. c) qodes qoddi"m (oyLc ay&amp;iov) refers to the 346</page><page sequence="11">"Aytoq IN THE SEPTUAGINT 347 meal offering, Lev. vi 17 (10); x 12; guilt offering, Lev. vi 31, 36 (vii 1, 6); xiv 13; the sin offering, Lev. vi 25 (18), 29 (22); x 17. 2. In MT the nomen regens may be in the plural: qodse haqq6ddazm (the holinesses of holinesses, the holies of holies) rendered rT&amp; o&amp;y T-rcV O&amp;yov (the most holy [offerings]); this expression is used for the meal offering, sin offering, and guilt offering eaten by the priests, Ezek. xlii 13 (1°, 2°), with which cf. 2 Ch. xxxi 14; offerings permitted to be eaten by deformed priests, Lev. xxi 22; sacrifices offered only by priests of the line of Sadok, Ezek. xliv 13. 2. The use of the super- lative in connection with the sanctuary. This falls into the following classification. I. The Tabernacle. 1. qodes haqqoddaim (the holiness of holinesses, the holy of holies), rendered To cy&amp;ov Tcov oyov (the most holy [place]). a) It may be applied to the court of the tent of meeting, Num. xviii 10; for the sense, cf. Lev. vi 16 (9), 26 (19); vi 36 (vii 6). b) As the holy of holies, it signifies the inner sanctuary, Ex. xxvi 33. II. In case of the Temple (of Solomon), qjdes haqqoddaim, rendered as a singular, To6 cyLov T)v &amp;yiov refers to the inner sanc- tuary, 1 Kings vi 17 (16); the same sense is found in 2 Ch. iii 8, 6 o0xo '0 To &amp;yiou Tov &amp;yiov; cf. 1 Kings vii 36 (50), where &amp;ayou Tov cycov is in apposition with To5 o''xou To0 eaoa-Tou. On the other hand, both nouns may be in the plural in G: 2 Ch. iv 22; v 7. III. In case of the Second Temple, qodes qoddsim (&amp;ytov &amp;yLcov) is used in a general sense, Dan. ix 24 (G Th). IV. In case of Ezekiel's Temple, qodes haqq#ddsim (ro aytov Trjv ayiLov) means 'the holy of holies' or the inner sanctuary, Ezek. xli 4. On the other hand, qodes qoddaim (&amp;yta Tirv &amp;y¥tLv) refers to the Temple in a general sense, Ezek. xlv 3. From this survey of the adjectival and nominal use of ayLto in the LXX it appears that in a number of cases one has to be conversant with LXX Greek or have the Hebrew text beside the Greek in order to understand the Greek version. If the Hebrew text in some instances is obscure and the meaning can be determined only by close scrutiny of the context or by the use of a commentary, it must be admitted that the Greek translators have well succeeded in representing the ideas of qddas and words derived from this root. It seems that there was considerable freedom in the translation of the neuter, which in reference to the Temple was used in the singular or in the plural with- out apparent difference in meaning. In the books which have no Hebrew counterpart the plural Traoc ytc (not the neuter singular) is the word employed for sanctuary in broad sense of the Temple: Judith iv 12f; xvi 20 (24); 1 Mac. iii 43, 59; vi 18, 54; xiv 15 bis, 36,</page><page sequence="12">348 GEHMAN, ~'AyLoS IN THE SEPTUAGINT 42f., 48; 2 Mac. xv 17. The variation of &amp;yLov and oytoc is represented in various books, and the occurrences within the same book do not justify us in assuming that they emanate from different translators. The most we can say is that the translators were not consistent and that the editorial supervision or revision was not strict, and in conse- quence the final rendering was not reduced to uniformity.</page></plain_text>
