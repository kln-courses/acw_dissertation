<plain_text><page sequence="1">Why Hayek is a Conservative BY PAUL B. CLITEUR, LEIDEN The Dutch Catholiç politician Nolens declared in the Second Chamber of Parliament in 1918 that people would rather be accused of arson or theft than of conservatism. Although "conservatism" is not as unpopulär as it was several years ago, most political philosophers reject the epithet as applicable to their work. Friedrich Hayek is such a thinker. In his magnum opus The Constitution of Liberty he wrote a postscript under the title Why I am not a Conservative. The indebtedness of Hayek to the conservative tra dition is the subject of this essay. I want to enquire whether Hayek's rejection of the qualification "conservative" for his own work is correct. Therefore, it is necessary first to shoot a glance at Hayek's political philosophy, second to investígate on the meaning of conservatism. 1. Two traditions Hayek distinguishes between two traditions: a rationalist and non-rationalist tradition. The rationalist tradition, going back to Plato in ancient Greece, has been forcefully stated by René Descartes and further developed by Bacon, Hobbes, Helvetius, Beccaria, Rousseau, Marx, Bentham, and Austin.2 These thinkers contended that all the useful human institutions were, and ought to be, delibérate créations of conscious reason. Essential is the Cartesian esprit géométrique, a capacity of the mind to arrive at the truth by a deductive process from a few obvious and undoubtable premisses.3 Hayek vehemently opposes this tradition. It involves not only a "colossal presump tion conceming our intellectual powers, but also a complete misconception of the kind of world in which we live."4 The crucial fact of our lives is that we are not omniscient.5 The Cartesian Mind must lead to the destruction of all moral values and to the belief that the individual should be guided only by his personal évaluation of the particular end he pursues. Lord Keynes described this State of mind very clearly in an autobiographical essay when he said that he and his ffiends repudiated entirely customary moráis, Conventions and traditional wisdom. "We claimed the right to judge every individual case on its merits", according to Keynes.6 The rationalist tradition is a way of thinking that has not only left its marks in phi losophical methodology but also in legal and political thought.

Cliteur lism, the way to explain and legitimize the State is the social contract and law is considered to be a création of the State.7 The legal positivists had carried the cult of reason in jurisprudence furthest.8 Legal positivism clings to the essentially anthropomorphic view which regards all rules of justice as the product of delibérate invention or design. Hayek calis the tradition he opposes naïve rationalism or rational constructivism. In the social sphere this vision has wrought unmeasurable harm, although in the sphere of technology it may have had great achievements.9 Ultimately, it is from this kind of rationalism that modem socialism, planning and even totalitarianism results.10 The spirit of rationalism is thoroughly congenial to the atmosphère of an absolute State which endeavoured to design a new centralized structure of government.11 2. Non-constructivist rationalism The other tradition is "more modest and less ambitious".12 It assumes that, in ail our thinking, we are guided by rules of which we are not aware, and that, therefore, our conscious reason can always take account of only some of the circumstances which determine our actions. His own work Hayek sees as a contribution to the non constructivist tradition. Classic forerunners of this tradition are David Hume and, ultimately, Aristotle and Cicero. In the field of political philosophy, it has been developed by Alexis de Tocque ville, Lord Acton, Bernard Mandeville, Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, Dugald Stewart, Adam Ferguson and among the contemporary philosophers by Karl Popper.13 Popper has coined for it the ñame of "critical rationalism" which "very happily expresses the contrast to the naïve rationalism or constructivism", according to Hayek.14 Especially Hume is mentioned by Hayek as the philosophie founding father of the tradition of non-constructivist rationalism. When he said that the rules of morality are not the conclusions of our reason he showed awareness of the limitations of the naïve rationalism of Descartes and his followers.15 Reason itself is utterly impotent to create moral rules. Hume clearly states the superiority of an order which will resuit when each member obeys the same abstract rules, even without understanding their significance, compared with a condition in which each individual action was decided on the grounds of expedieney.16 Hume "turned against the Enlightenment its own weapons and undertook to whittle down the Claims of reason by the use of rational analysis", Hayek approvingly cites Sheldon Wolin. He is not only one of the founders of economic theory but should also 7 Hayek, "Kinds of Rationalism", p. 86. 8 Hayek, "Kinds of Rationalism", p. 94.

Two kinds of liberalism or liberalism and conservatism? The central problem with Hayek's distinction between the two traditions is that constructivist liberalism and non-constructivist liberalism are both called liberalism. Prima facie, this is a stränge thing. If the two traditions are so fundamentally opposed to each other as Hayek wants his readers to believe, then how is it possible, or perhaps should we say, why is it advisable, to bring them under the same heading? It is not amazing that scholars are quarreling about the classification of Hayek's philosophy. Some say that at least a considerable conservative strain can be detected in it and, taking into account what has been expounded as the general traits of Hayek's political philosophy, this should not be rejected without further considération.20 Hayek himself is conscious of this State of affairs. "Many people will feel (..), that the position which emerges is hardly what they used to call 'liberal'", he writes about his own political philosophy.21 Let us see what are the characteristics of the second tradition: organicism, a stress on the importance of tradition, history, évolution, spontaneous orders, the boundaries of human intelligence, and modesty. And what is it opposed to? To abstract thinking, rationalisai, a thinking detached from culture, and history. Hayek epitomized his own thinking in a foreword to The Constitution of Liberty where he spoke of a "modest and even humble creed, based on a low opinion of men's wisdom and capacities" and an awareness that, within the range for which we can plan, "even the best society will not satisfy all our desires". His outlook is "as remóte from perfectionism as it is from the hurry and impatience of the passionate reformer, whose indignation about particular evils so often blinds him to the harm and injustice that the realization of his plans is likely to produce."22 Hayek is not only opposed to the rationalist tradition but even states that he is in opposition to "the Continental liberalism, which derives from the French Revolution".23 With this State of affairs, Hayek's position as a liberal is at least questionable. Espe cially his rejection of the spirit of the French Revolution, "with its totalitarian democ racy and socialist leanings",24 clearly reminds us of conservatism and in a postscript to The Constitution of Liberty the writer himself states that his position has often been described as conservative.25 Before we can tackle the question of Hayek's indebtedness Hayek, "The (..)

Cliteur to the conservative tradition, however, we should first determine what can be seen as the essence of conservative thinking. 4. What is conservatism? Most scholars agree that the birth of a delibérate international conservatism is dated by Edmund Burke's essay Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790).26 He did not use the noun "conservatism" (although he did use the verb "to conserve") but most scholars agree that it was his reaction on the French Revolution that forms the eradle of the political ideology we now call conservatism.27 Burke made conservatism articúlate as it had never been before.28 Therefore, most theoreticians of conservatism take his work as a point of departure; they try to distill from his pamphlets, aphorisms and obiter dicta a coherent ideology. The essence of conservative thinking can be identified with a prédilection for anthropological pessimism (1), traditionalism (2), empiricism (3) and constitutionalism (4). I will go more deeply into each of these points hereafter. Human nature. Almost ail the books on conservatism stress the importance of a pessimistic, or realistic, view of man : "The conservad ves taught that man was a weak and sinful créature and therefore imperfect."29 Man is not the proud lord of the universe but a fallible being with limited power over himself and the universe. Paine and Burke are usually contrasted in this respect. Paine, the radical, incarnates the optimism of the Enlightenment, Burke, the conservative, stands for the pessimistic reaction to the revolutionary ideáis and rationalistic optimism of people like Voltaire, Condorcet and even Rousseau.30 "Not being illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of France tell us they have got so abundant a share", Burke praises the builders of the English constitution as acting "under a strong impression of the ignorance and fal libility of mankind".31 This is the reason why Peter Viereck gave great Christian pessimists as Karl Barth and Reinhold Niebuhr a place is his history of conservatism. Their common denomina Cf. Epstein, The Genesis ofGerman Conservatism, p. 4; Viereck, Conservatism, p. 10: "The birth of a delibérate international conservatism is dated by Edmund Burke's essay of 1790, Reflections on the Revolution in France, in the same way that the birth of international Marxism is dated by the Communist Manifestó of 1848"; Nisbet, Conservatism, p. 1; Hallowell, Main Currents ofPolitical Thought, p. 184: "The Enlightenment produced one kind of Romantic reaction But it produced another kind that while equally vehement in its rejection of the excessive claims made for reason, emphasized the importance of authority, tradition and custom.

"Distrusting human nature, most conservatives believe in Original Sin at least metaphorically."32 There is, of course, a great variety of emphasis among conservatives in this respect. When the ultramontane royalist Joseph de Maistre qualifies man as "corrompu dans son essence"33 this is meant to be taken literally. But he is not far aloof of Hayek when the 20th Century liberal writes that the antirationalist tradition he favours is close to "the Christian tradition of the fallibility and sinfulness of man, while the perfectionism of the rationalist is in irreconcilable conflict with it."34 Traditionalism. Conservatism, however, is a political ideology. Anthropological pessi mism, or realism, as some would call it, can be the basis of£onservative thought, it is not identical with it. The view of man is a stepping stone, as it were, for political considérations. What political conclusions do conservatives derive from their view of man? Their pessimism involves that man, taken by himself, cannot fulfill his aspirations. Man is essentially a social being; it is only in society that he can reach his optimum state. Only in an organized political community can human reason be brought to its proper develop ment.35 As the Augustinian pessimism contended against the Pelagian optimism, that man is always dépendent on divine grâce and himself can attain no felicity, conservative pessimism states that man would be totally lost without the wisdom of his ancestors as handed over by tradition in a social context.36 This is what we could call the traditionalist conviction of conservatives.37 It is Edmund Burke again who states this elegantly in his much honoured phrase: "We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason; because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuáis would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages."38 If every man had to solve all the problems for himself, progress could never be made. But essential to man is that he has his traditions. And this enables the individual to live much better than he could live without them. It makes it possible for him to rely on more wisdom than his own. This point of view has great relevance for jurisprudence. Thomas Paine and Rous seau argued against the established order of Europe on the basis of the natural and imprescriptible rights of men.39 Burke, however, chose to defend the traditional wisdom accumulated in traditions and institutions under the name of préjudice. "The march of the human mind is slow", he said.40 Time is needed for perfection in our political institutions and legal principies; time and the long experience of successive généra tions.41 Viereck, Conservatism, p. 40.

Cliteur Hayek agréés with him about this stress on the importance of tradition. He cites with great approval the words of the American legal scholar J.C. Carter,42 who claimed that law is not a product of designing intellect, but is based on habit and custom. This is, according to Hayek, not only a simple Statement of fact about the origins of law, but also gives us information on the status of law: "If it had been deliberately designed, it would deserve to rank among the greatest of human inventions."43 So Hayek's traditionalism is a distinctive feature of his political philosophy. He makes a special contribution to this kind of thought, however, when he links it with our understanding of how an economic order functions. It is not only in the historical context that man is dépendent on the wisdom of millions of other people, it is also in the here and now that civilization is dépendent on the effort of countless individuáis. The task of economic theory is to explain how an overall order of economic activity was achieved which utilized a large amount of knowledge which was not concentrated in any one mind but existed only as the separate knowledge of thousands or millions of différent individuáis.44 Expérience and the method of trial and error. Burke was opposed to what Michael Oakeshott later called rationalisai in politics. "Nothing universal can be rationally affirmed on any moral or political subject", Burke wrote. "Pure metaphysical abstrac tion does not belong to these matters. The lines of morality are not like ideal lines of mathematics. They are broad and deep as well as long. They admit of exceptions; they demand modifications. These exceptions and modifications are not made by the process of logic, but by the rules of prudence. Prudence is not only the first in rank of the virtues political and moral but she is the director, the regulator, the Standard of them all."45 Why are conservatives so pertinent on the bank and capital of ages and nations? It is because it is the fruit of experience and reflection.46 The rules conducive to the formation of a spontaneous order are regarded as the product of long expérimentation in the past, Hayek says.47 But doesn't that imply a complete standstill of progress? According to conservatives, this need not be the case, because they are not opposed to every kind of change, only to drastic change. Cecil even writes that progress in science or in the arts of government or of social life requires a certain readiness to go beyond experience and to try novelties.48 When we are modifying reality, however, we should be cautious. It is of vital importance to understand that the conservative tradition, in its Burkian form at least, is not opposed to change. This appears clearly from Burke's Reflections, where he writes: "A State without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation."49 This is also the position Hayek defends: "Improvement must proceed slowly and step by step as new experience showed it to be desirable."50 Only by a slow experimental Carter, Law: Its Origin, Growth and Function.

The anthropological pessimism of the conservative tradition is also the basis of much political theorizing of the founding fathers. Hamilton spoke of "the depravity of human nature" and Adams said that whoever would found a State must presume that all men are bad by nature.52 But this was not a conviction with only theological importance. They argued from this stance to the necessity of making restrictions to majority rule. Conservatives are rather skeptical towards majority rule in the sense of unlimited government. Liberal democrats are usually in sympathy with easy amendments, facili ties for mass pressure and rapid change, unchecked popular sovereignty and only one parliamentary body.53 In the Constitution of 1787 the Federalists, however, made amendments slow and difficult. "Even today the principie of judicial review keeps the Constitution aristocratie, not démocratie", Viereck writes.54 The founding fathers were convinced that the people can be as tyrannie as any king. Adams wrote : "Absolute power intoxicates alike despots, monarchs, aristocrats, and democrats (..)" Therefore, Madison wrote in the tenth Federalist about the advantage a republic has over a democracy. A democracy meant for him unchecked majority rule. The answer to all this was constitu tionalism and judicial review. Hayek is immersed in this tradition and, as appears from chapter 12 ("The American Contribution: Constitutionalism") of The Constitution of Liberty, he links this explicit ly with his distinction between the two kinds of tradition. A conséquence of Hayek's rejection of one of the traditions is that Hayek stresses that not everything can be decided in a démocratie way in the sense that everything should be submitted to the décision of majority rule. The rationalist tradition aeeepts no limits to human power, the non constructivist tradition does. In this context, Hayek makes a sharp distinction between democracy and liberalism. Liberalism, he writes, is concerned mainly with limiting the coercing powers of government, whereas the dogmatic demoerat acknowledges no limits to government; majority opinion is supreme.55 That implies that a democracy may well wield totalitarian powers, as J.L. Talmon stated in his The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy.56 Liberalism is a doctrine about what the law ought to be, democracy a doctrine about the manner of determining what will be the law. Essential to liberalism is a limitation to government: it tries to persuade the majority to observe certain principies.57 The liberal believes that there are definite limits to the range of questions which should be demoeratieally decided.58 To the liberal a mere act of will of a momentary majority derives its authority from a wider agreement on common principies. There is no reason Hayek, "Kinds of Rationalism", p. 92. Cf. Rossiter, Conservatism in America, p. 109. Viereck, Conservatism, p. 90. Viereck, Conservatism, p. 91. Hayek, The Constitution, p. 103.

In my view it cannot be denied that there is a great similarity. As I said, Hayek stresses that his point of departure is a modest and humble creed based on a low opinion of men's wisdom and capacities. A différence of emphasis with the pessimistic anthropology of more radical conservatives such as Joseph de Maistre is clear: Hayek stresses the fundamental ignorance of man as a simple Statement of fact on pure secular grounds, whereas for Maistre theological considérations are at least partly relevant. The final result, however, is the same. Also in his traditionalism Hayek's kinship to conservative thinking is manifest. His insights in the functioning of the spontaneous order of the market process stimulated him to an extension of this idea in the field of jurisprudence and politics. For Burke the point of departure was différent, but, again, the result was the same. For Burke the sound political order is the unintended outcome of accidental causation.61 Burke applied to the production of the sound political order what modern political economy had taught about the production of public prosperity : the common good is the product of activities which are not by themselves ordered toward the common good.62 The "love of lucre" is for Burke "the grand cause of prosperity to all states".63 In his emphasis on the necessity of the method of trial and error and the importance of limited government, Hayek is also within the confines to the mainstream of conser vative thought. From all this, a clear family-resemblance of Hayek's thought to the conservative tradition is manifest. What Hayek calis non-constructivism is the same as what Quinton, O'Sullivan and others call conservatism. A problem, however, is Hayek's own attitude towards conservatism. Although he makes some friendly remarks about the conservative tradition, his general attitude is hostile to it. Let us see what Hayek writes about conservatism and enquire whether this is a reason to modify my conclusion that his non constructivism can be identified with conservatism. 5.

His own position he wants to classify as liberalism. The liberal position differs as much from true conservatism as from socialisai, Hayek writes.65 He is opposed to conservatism because: 1. "By its very nature it cannot offer an alternative to the direction in which we are moving".66 It may succeed in slowing down undesirable developments, but it does not indicate another direction. For this reason the fate of conservatism is "to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing".67 2. The conservative is essentially Opportunist and lacks principies.68 Again, this should be carefully discerned from liberalism: liberalism does not want to stand still, it has never been a backward-looking doctrine. 3. The conservative attitude is motivated by a fear of change, a timid distrust of the new as such, while the liberal position is based on courage and confidence.69 4. Conservatives are opposed to new ideas because they have no distinctive principies of their own to oppose them.70 5. Conservatism is fond of authority and lacks understanding of economic forces. "Since it distrusts both abstract théories and general principies, it neither understands those spontaneous forces on which a policy of freedom relies ñor possesses a basis for formulating principies of policy."71 As his criticism of conservatism advances, Hayek introduces more and more supposed elements of conservatism, such as that the conservatives blame the evils of our time on democracy or that the conservatives favour power in the hands of some small elite.72 "If you want to discuss with me, please define your terms", Voltaire said. This goes a fortiori for essentially contested concepts such as "conservatism". Every discussion on conservatism has to start with an analysis of the way the concept is used. Implicit in Hayek's way of using the term, there seems to be a vision on the essence of conserva tism. It is helpful in this respect to introduce a distinction made by Samuel Huntington. In a famous article Huntington discerned three théories of conservatism. The aristo cratie theory defines conservatism as the ideology of a single specific and unique historical movement: the reaction of the feudal—aristocratie—agrarian classes to the French Revolution, liberalism, and the rise of the bourgeoisie at the end of the eighteenth Century and during the first half of the nineteenth Century.73 The autonomous définition sees conservatism as an autonomous System of ideas which are generally valid, such as justice, order, balance, and modération. The situational définition views conservatism as the ideology arising out of a distinct but recurring type of historical situation in which Hayek, The Constitution, p. 397.

When he defines conservatism as opposition to change, opportunism and so on, conservatism appears to have no content whatever for Hayek. This partly explains some of the derogatory comments he makes on conservative thought. From this sort of conservatism it can be rightly said that "by its very nature it cannot offer an alternative to the direction in which we are moving".75 Indeed, the only thing it may succeed in is slowing down undesirable developments, but it does not indicate another direction. It is indeed the fate of conservatism in this sense "to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing".76 But this concept of conservatism is not the only possible use of the word and the situational définition has not remained unchallenged. It has the advantage of having some foundation in common parlance (we can speak of the conservative protest of people who object to Gorbatchev's innovations) but problematic is that in this sense, conserva tism is emptied of any content. We can hardly have a conservative tradition in this sense: that would be a tradition of people who have nothing more in common than their aversion of change. When his argument progresses, Hayek gives us the impression of accepting some Substantive characteristics such as an opposition to democracy ("I can have no sympathy with the anti-democratic strain of conservatism"), a prédilection for elites and protectio nism, its hostility to internationalism, and its proneness to a strident nationalism.77 This anti-internationalism is also a stepping stone to imperialism.78 This is more than only opposition to change; it is more than a mere formal définition of conservatism, and we can ask: do these characteristics harmonize with what other scholars have discemed as the essence of conservatism? In my view Hayek is exces sively hostile and even unfair to conservative thinkers, for instance when he states that conservatives do not believe in the power of argument, are refusing to face the facts, or that they reject well-sustained new knowledge because they dislike some of the consé quences which seem to follow from it.79 Characteristic to conservatism is, "to put it bluntly, its obscurantism".80 These words of Hayek remind us of the derogatory qualification of the conservative party as the "stupid party" by J.S. Mill. Whatever objections one may have against conservatism, conservative theoreticians such as Anthony Quinton or Michael Oakeshott présent a coherent and rational conservative outlook that is very similar to the tradition Hayek wants to qualify as non-constructive liberalism. Hayek's thesis about two traditions of "liberalism" can therefore be seriously questioned. He must confess that the majority of Continental liberáis stood for ideas to which the non-constructive tradition was strongly opposed, and that they were led more by a desire to impose upon the world a preconceived rational pattern than to provide opportunity for free growth. Hayek's non-constructivist tradition, the tradition of Burke and Hume, is simply conservatism. Huntington, "Conservadsm as an Ideology", p. 455. Hayek, The Constitution, p. 398.
