<plain_text><page sequence="1">ciENCE, Animal Sympathy, and Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" Mary Ellen Bellanca "The immediate use of natural science is the power it gives us over nature." Joseph Priestley, The History and Present State of Electricity "An infant may destroy life, but all the kings of the earth cannot restore it." Anna Barbauld and John Aikin, "What Animals Are Made For" Mealtime in the household of Joseph Priestley could evidently be an un orthodox affair, punctuated by the introduction of newly caught animal speci mens for his scientific experiments. As the natural philosopher's friend, Anna Letitia Aikin (later Barbauld) had occasion to observe this phenomenon first hand. In 1771, in experiments that would lead to his discovery of oxygen, Priest ley was using live mice to test the effects of mixing air with various gases. One evening when Barbauld was visiting, according to memoirist William Turner, "It happened that a captive [mouse] was brought in after supper, too late for any experiment to be made with it that night, and the servant was desired to set it by till next morning." Overnight, while Priestley may have contemplated the com position of air, Barbauld made a composition of her own: her poem "The Mouse's Petition," which was found, Turner reports, "twisted among the wires of the cage" the next day when it "was brought in after breakfast." Cast in the mouse's voice, the poem makes an eloquent, if tongue-in-cheek, argument for the rodent's release: Mary Ellen Bellanca is Assistant Professor of English at the University of South Carolina Sumter. She has published articles on Pope, George Eliot, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. She is completing a book manuscript entitled Days of Green Discovery: Writing Nature in Nine teenth-Century British Diaries and Journals.

If e'er thy breast with freedom glow'd, And spurn'd a tyrant's chain, Let not thy strong oppressive force A free-born mouse detain. (Poem 19, lines 1-4, 9-12)1 According to Turner, the plea was so effective that Priestley let the mouse go.2 "The Mouse's Petition" struck a responsive chord as well with contem porary and later readers. It has been reprinted often, by admirers ranging from Mary Wollstonecraft to the World Wildlife Fund, and it may have influenced Robert Burns's "To a Mouse." The text was first published in Barbauld's Poems in 1773, entitled "The Mouse's Petition, Found in the Trap where he had been Confined all Night" and dedicated "To Doctor Priestley." Readers immediately seized upon it as an indictment of animal experimentation.3 Barbauld disclaimed any intent of criticizing Priestley, but her critics saw the poem as a denunciation of "the cruelty practised by experimental philosophers, who seem to think the brute creation void of sensibility, or created only for them to torment."4 By 1796, two years before The Rime of the Ancient Mariner?"the great English romantic poem about the consequences of mistreating the animal kingdom"?Samuel Tay lor Coleridge could write, "thanks to Mrs. Barbauld,... it has become universal ly fashionable to teach lessons of compassion towards animals."5 Invoking liberty and decrying tyranny, "The Mouse's Petition" lends it self to interpretations in which the suppliant mouse, a mouthpiece for liberal reform, stands in for detained and oppressed humans. Marlon Ross, for example, asks whether it is "a political poem that uses the occasion of an 'imprisoned' mouse to satirize the 'enlighteners'" or "a political poem that . . . make[s] a seri ous petition for the rights of commoners."6 The caged, trapped, or abused animal was admittedly a powerful image in print and iconography for various kinds of imprisonment, whether physical, psychological, or social. In a complex texture of reciprocal signification, one vulnerable group often pointed to another, so that slaves were represented as confined or exploited animals, women as slaves or as caged birds, pet animals as slaves. Opposition to injurious uses of nonhuman creatures, such as hunting, blood sports, and scientific experiments, increased in the 1770s alongside debates about slavery. Barbauld's "Petition" wields a rheto ric of sensibility that sought to change attitudes about inequality?and the poten tial violence of unequal power relations?in many forms: chattel slavery, incar ceration, marriage, labor, and animal ownership.7 In the 1790s, while publishing children's texts that promoted animal sympathy, Barbauld would mobilize what Moira Ferguson calls the century's "multilayered discourse on cruelty" to casti gate the nation, in her "Epistle to William Wilberforce," for failing to halt the slave trade.8 In this essay, however, I focus on the more immediate and literal context of "The Mouse's Petition"?the use of living animals in scientific experiments, which by midcentury had emerged as a topic of public debate9?and on the role</page><page sequence="3">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 49 of science in Barbauld's work. Defenders of animal experiments maintained, in a rationale argued since antiquity, that nonhuman creatures exist to serve human needs and require no ethical consideration because they possess neither souls nor rational minds. But scientific, political, and social changes in the eighteenth cen tury, including shifting constructions of human-animal relations, worked to un dermine some ancient assumptions. Rapid discoveries of exotic species around the globe, including thousands of insects and microorganisms?to say nothing of extinct animals that no human had ever seen?challenged anthropocentric com placency. Extending sensibility's valorization of feeling, advocates for the "brute creation" promoted the new belief that animals experience sensation and can therefore suffer pain.10 The first-person plea of Barbauld's mouse, who claims to have a "brother's soul" (line 34), gives voice to the concern with animal suffering and to a cultural "myth of kinship"11 based on fellow-feeling. "The Mouse's Petition" also provides an entry point for exploring late century dynamics of science and gender. As a young woman excluded from the fraternity of experimental natural philosophers, Barbauld commented on Priest ley's work not in the laboratory or in scientific correspondence but in the domes tic spaces of the dining room and the meal table. Working in a tradition of wom en's anthropomorphic writing about animals, Barbauld does "challenge the male universe exemplified by Priestley's scientific experiments," as Stuart Curran ob serves.12 Yet the "Petition" does not simply inscribe a showdown between scien tific patriarchy and feminine sensibility. Alongside the "universe" of experimen tal inquiry flourished another world of women's scientific learning. Barbauld, like Priestley, valued the advancement of scientific knowledge as well as the qual ity of "humanity" or compassion toward nonhuman animals. Nor was Priestley insensitive to animal welfare; as we shall see, his own writings betray an uneasi ness about hurting weaker creatures in the pursuit of knowledge. Barbauld's works, in general, simultaneously promote science knowledge for women and men, rein force cultural boundaries between the sexes' intellectual territories, and warn against the excessive ambition of male scientists. Her poetry both celebrates and critiques an Enlightenment science that increased the physical comfort of human beings yet destroyed animals for knowledge about their bodies, and opened intel lectual avenues to women yet kept them well behind its frontiers of discovery. As a crowded discursive space, then, the mousetrap imagined in Barbauld's poem captures a moment in a multivocal dialogue encompassing the poet, the natural philosopher, and the cultures of science and sensibility. The "Petition" embodies, but does not reconcile, tensions in both Barbauld's and Priestley's work between the desire for knowledge and misgivings about its ethical and humanitar ian costs. In addition, the poem experiments with a motif that recurs subtly but persistently in Barbauld's work: the dangers inherent in the manipulation of na ture by an increasingly technocratic world view. SCIENCE FOR "BOTH SEXES," WOMEN'S "BOUNDED SPHERE" Barbauld may be situated in the eighteenth-century culture of science in which women studied the natural world for "rational amusement" and personal improvement. Practitioners of traditional herbal healing, women also became</page><page sequence="4">50 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/1 enthusiastic "consumers of scientific knowledge" by reading books and by col lecting and sketching plants and flowers. Some aristocratic women studied and patronized botany, entomology, and astronomy.13 Barbauld's books for children exerted an important influence on younger writers such as Charlotte Smith, Priscilla Wakefield, and Sarah Trimmer, who earned public authority and success by pop ularizing scientific knowledge. As an author and educator, Barbauld encouraged "many young persons of both sexes" to study and appreciate the natural world.14 At the same time, her career is emblematic of a "cultural paradox" in attitudes toward women's learning: general knowledge, including science knowledge, was approved, but "excessively" serious pursuits were ridiculed as pedantic and un feminine.15 Anticipating a backlash against female learnedness, Barbauld acced ed?reluctantly, it may be?to the subordination of women's intellectual interests to their domestic vocation. Learning about natural processes was, for Barbauld, not only desirable but imperative. At Warrington Academy, the Dissenting college founded by her father, the curriculum was "particularly strong in natural science."16 There Bar bauld became friends with Priestley, who was a tutor at the academy, and his wife, Mary Priestley, as well as Hester Chapone, an advocate of scientific knowl edge for women.17 Later, Barbauld's work as a collaborating writer and editor with her brother, John Aikin, a polymath with interests in medicine, natural phi losophy, and chemistry, brought her into contact with current work in natural science.18 At the Palgrave School, which she founded with her husband, Roche mont Barbauld, she instructed scores of boys, including Joseph Priestley Jr., about "the natural history of animals," reportedly in an engaging way.19 Although Charles Lamb famously condemned the "cursed Barbauld crew" for "cramming" chil dren with the "sore evil" of science, modern scholars have found that Barbauld's students enjoyed and fondly remembered her "imaginative and entertaining" teach ing, especially in natural history.20 Like the works of Smith, Trimmer, and Wollstonecraft, Barbauld's books introduce readers to factual observation at an early age. Her Lessons for Children prompts youngsters to follow the stages of insect metamorphosis?"all the pretty butterflies that you see flying about were caterpillars once, and crawled on the ground"?and her instruction on animal habits and habitats fosters sympathy: "Here is a poor little snail crawling up the wall. Touch him with your little finger. Ah, the snail is crept into his shell. . . . Let him alone, and he will soon come out again."21 Barbauld and Aikin's prose collection, Evenings at Home: or, the Juve nile Budget Opened, revels in the passionate, if relentlessly empirical, fascination with nature that characterizes many educational texts of the 1790s. Replete with facts about oaks, pines, grasses, "Leguminous Plants," and "Compound Flow ers," the volume uses the popular form of the edifying adult-child dialogue to cultivate a sense of wonder.22 In older students, including women, Barbauld urged reverence for nature as well as knowledge. In a series of letters to "Young La dies," she wrote: "The great laws of the universe, the nature and properties of those objects which surround us, it is unpardonable not to know: it is more un pardonable to know, and not to feel the mind struck with lively gratitude."23 General science was a topic of lifelong learning: in 1800, attending a lecture at the Royal Institution, the poet was "much pleased to see a fashionable and very at</page><page sequence="5">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 51 tentive audience, about one third ladies, assembled for the purposes of science and improvement."24 Barbauld's early poems dramatize interactions with nature that were cul turally sanctioned for women. For "To Mrs. P[riestley], with some Drawings of Birds and Insects," she consulted Thomas Pennant's British Zoology25 and possi bly her own observation. The poem acts out the naturalist's essential tasks, cata loguing and classifying behaviors and habitats of "various [bird] nations" (Poem 3, line 21). The poem also discusses bird migration, a topic of keen interest to eighteenth-century ornithologists: When winter bites upon the naked plain, Nor food nor shelter in the groves remain; The congregated nations wing their way In dusky columns o'er the trackless sea. (lines 61-2, 65-6)26 In this portrait of the poet as a naturalist, Barbauld embraces nature study as a leisure activity to fill the "lonely hour" (line 121) and as a satisfying medium of female friendship. However, her writings also propagate the view that men and women are not entitled to the same degree of learning about nature. "To Dr. Aikin on his Complaining that she neglected him" (Poem 7) describes Barbauld's experience with the sexes' divergent "paths." The poem recalls the interests and "sympathy" that she and her brother shared in their youth, until maturity sent them on differ ent assignments: "Our path divides?to thee fair fate assign'd / The nobler la bours of a manly mind" (lines 20, 50-1). In adulthood, the sister's scope is con fined to "more humble works, and lower cares" (line 52). While John Aikin will garner acclaim for his medical work and his writing, Barbauld acknowledges her own "bounded sphere" (line 6). The poem's negatives suggest the self-restraint of desire: Barbauld will not "strive to soar too high, / Nor for the tree of knowledge vainly sigh"; rather, she will "Check the fond love of science and of fame, / A bright, but ah! a too devouring flame" (lines 56-9). In Harriet Guest's view, the poet "briefly . . . chafes" against the prescribed difference in life paths; William McCarthy goes further, arguing that these passages express Barbauld's "wistful enviousness" of Aikin's opportunities: the text "documents] her resentment of woman's restricted fate [and] her imaginative resistance to that fate."27 Barbauld's "bounded sphere" limns the containment of women's intel lectual aspirations in an era when, as Ann B. Shteir has written, the "fear of female learnedness was a leitmotif" in texts about women and science, which often brandished the horrifying "specter" of overeducated spinsterhood.28 Harriet Guest has documented the host of contradictory roles in which the "learned lady" could be cast: public spectacle, icon of British progressiveness, potential sexual scandal, imitator of male scholarly over-specialization.29 Women's participation in "science culture" notwithstanding, the perceived benefits of formal scientific study were limited. Shteir notes that until well into the nineteenth century, women were "excluded from formal participation in the public institutions of... science. They could not be members of the Royal Society [which admitted Priestley] or the Linnean Society, could not attend meetings, read papers, or (with very rare excep tions) see their findings published in the journals of these societies."30</page><page sequence="6">52 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/1 The disapproval that could shadow intellectual women helps to contex tualize the much-debated letter of 1774 in which Barbauld declines an invitation to establish a young "ladies'" academy.31 For women "to be taught in a regular systematic manner the various branches of science," she writes, would more like ly produce "such characters as the 'Pr?cieuses' or the 'Femmes scavantes' of Mo liere, than good wives or agreeable companions." Advanced learning for women entails deception and risks public humiliation: Young ladies, who ought only to have such a general tincture of knowledge as to make them agreeable companions to a man of sense, and to enable them to find rational entertainment for a solitary hour, should gain these accomplishments in a more quiet and unobserved manner. . . . The thefts of knowledge in our sex are only connived at while carefully concealed, and if displayed, punished with disgrace.32 A woman's ultimate calling is the domestic sphere, which affords little room for intellectual pursuits: The line of separation between the studies of a young man and a young woman appears to me to be chiefly fixed by this,?that a woman is excused from all professional knowledge. . . . Women have but one [department in life], and all women have the same .... It is, to be a wife, a mother, a mistress of a family. The knowledge belonging to these duties is your professional knowledge, the want of which nothing will excuse. Young women are also "excused" from hands-on scientific research: the most suitable lessons for them are those that "may be learnt at home without experi ments or apparatus."33 These rules of engagement appear to govern "The Invitation" (Poem 4), a rural retreat poem written, like "To Mrs. P," for an absent woman friend.34 Early in the poem, the outdoors is a scene of female pleasures both sensory and cerebral. Nature's energies are represented through feminine bird and plant imag ery: "FLORA," deity of the botanical world, wields the spring's "transforming power," and "heav'n-born" science, a key attraction at Warrington, is also fem inine, a proud, "ardent" eagle that can soar almost anywhere (lines 42, 98, 101). By the poem's end, however, the emphasis moves from the country's leisurely delights to the academic pursuits of Warrington's (male) inmates, which include zoology, botany, and entomology: Some [students] pensive creep along the shelly shore; Unfold the silky texture of a flower; With sharpen'd eyes [that is, microscopes] inspect an hornet's sting, And all the wonders of an insect's wing. Some trace with curious search the hidden cause Of nature's changes, and her various laws; Untwist her beauteous web, disrobe her charms, And hunt her to her elemental forms, (lines 155-62) Along with the poem's focus, power relations have radically shifted. When the school's formal studies enter the picture, feminine nature diminishes in strength. No longer a transformative force, "she" becomes passive and sexualized, acted</page><page sequence="7">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 53 upon rather than acting?even preyed upon. The earth makes herself available for the students' searching, inspection, and analysis, and she obligingly "opens all her secret springs" for the "inquiring youth" who would "hunt" and "disrobe" her (lines 97, 95). The people who perform all this inspecting, tracing, and disrobing of nature are male. Some are laborers, the "sons of toil" who "scoop the hard bo som of the solid rock" to build the Duke of Bridgewater's canal. "Resistless" and patient, these men "compel the genius of th'unwilling flood" to make the river run where designing humans choose (lines 59-60, 61, 63). But the most impor tant masculine players are Warrington's product, "MAN," the alumni who, "impell'd by some resistless force" like the canal builders, will assume important positions in trade and the professions (lines 153, 145). The triumphant power of science contrasts starkly with Barbauld's feminine "Muse," who appears at the poem's end: "Unequal far such bright designs to paint, / . . . My drooping Muse folds up her fluttering wing" (lines 185, 187). "The Invitation" does not attack scientific activities or the exclusion of women from advanced formal study. On the contrary, the poet expresses pride in both the "little group" of students whom "their country calls" and the canal, which will foster "social plenty" (lines 135, 78). Barbauld's portrayal of feminine "Nature" suggests her immersion in a cultural language that subjects the femi nine to a knowledge system used largely by men. As gender theorists have argued, the myth of nature as "Woman" both describes and fosters an agenda of mastery in Enlightenment science. The metaphor does not empower actual flesh-and-blood women but identifies them with passive, pliable "Nature" and empowers actual men to control both women and the material environment.35 In "The Invitation," women look on with awe as male scientists and engineers apply knowledge that has valued real-world consequences, using powers that surpass the "drooping," "fluttering" capability of the feminine. The shifting borderlines in Barbauld's writings between insistence on knowledge for all and acceptance of feminine limitations exemplify her culture's ambiguities about nature, gender, and knowledge. Women could and did pursue natural history in its descriptive, aesthetic, and noninvasive modes; they became serious students of science, taught the young, and produced successful books for general readers. But women were not encouraged to become experimental or the oretical scientists, the producers and "shapers" of new knowledge.36 Barbauld's very phrasing is suggestive: as she writes in A Legacy for Young Ladies, women were "excused" from the professions, but "nothing [would] excuse" them from their domestic duty. Harriet Guest suggests that the public/professional and pri vate/domestic realms were more fluidly interactive than previously recognized, so that women's "exemption from [professional] productivity" may have been vital to their valued role of "civilizing" men.37 Even so, Barbauld's language of offense and judgment, pardon and excuse hints that the stakes were high for the trans gressively intellectual woman. The anecdote of the surreptitious deposit of her "Petition" in Priestley's mousetrap epitomizes women's need to maneuver around cultural proscriptions when they wanted to speak about science. Nonetheless, Barbauld's acquiescence to gender divisions in scientific study did not preclude criticism of one man's practice.</page><page sequence="8">54 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/1 "SO MUCH MANGLED": PRIESTLEY AND VIVISECTION If Barbauld was an outsider to experimental science, she was an insider in the Priestleys' "social circle," whose "brightening influence raised [her] pen sive mind" (Poem 1, lines 41-2). Their home provided a safe environment for intellectual dialogue and broadened the young poet's horizons beyond the bounds prescribed by her parents.38 By no means was "The Mouse's Petition" the only text in which she challenged Joseph Priestley; rather, it was one volley in an ongo ing battle of wits between the friends about the pursuit of knowledge. Their dialogue begins with Barbauld's reaction to Priestley's History of the Present State of Electricity. In the preface to the second edition, Priestley lo cates himself with other natural philosophers atop the mountain of knowledge: "To look down from the eminence, and to see, and compare all those gradual advances in the ascent, cannot but give the greatest pleasure to those who are seated on the eminence, and who feel all the advantages of their elevated situa tion." His agenda is ambitious, his claims for science sweeping: "The immediate use of natural science is the power it gives us over nature, by means of the knowl edge we acquire of its laws; whereby human life is, in its present state, made more comfortable and happy .... And by these sciences also it is, that the views of the human mind itself are enlarged, and our common nature improved and enno bled."39 Barbauld's response is "The Hill of Science: A Vision," a prose work published the same year as "The Mouse's Petition." In it she echoes Priestley's own phrasing while she rewrites the hill-of-science allegory to question the value of the "eminence" on which her friend is "seated." In Barbauld's text?part Pil grim's Progress, part Purgatorio?a pilgrim-dreamer labors toward the moun taintop "temple of Truth." Barbauld's hill is noticeably messier than Priestley's, due to the "heaps of rubbish, [which] continually tumbled down from the higher parts of the mountain." Some climbers become "disgusted" and give up: "sitting down on some fragment of the rubbish, [they] harangued the multitude below with the greatest marks of importance and self-complacency." But Barbauld's pro tagonist is rescued by a sudden apparition: not Truth but the goddess Virtue, a "form of diviner features and a more benign radiance," who imperiously an nounces, "Science may raise you to eminence, but I alone can guide you to felici ty!"40 Barbauld's "Hill of Science" reads like a reminder to Priestley of his own assertion that the claims of "benevolence" and moral virtue supersede the pursuit of power over nature. As he had written, "The greatest, and noblest use of philosoph ical speculation is the discipline of the heart, and the opportunity it affords of inculcating benevolent and pious sentiments upon the mind. . . . The contempla tion of the works of God should give a sublimity to [the philosopher's] virtue . . . and teach him to aspire to the moral perfections of the great author of all things."41 One realm in which virtue might cultivate a "discipline of the heart" was sympathy for animals. In parallel but not coincidental developments, experiments on animals had begun to attract criticism around midcentury, when the discourse of sensibility began to assert nonhuman creatures' capacity to suffer pain. The emphasis on animals' feeling departed from debates of previous eras, when con demnations of cruelty usually cited human-centered reasons such as animals' val</page><page sequence="9">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 55 ue as property or the belief that animal abusers would likely abuse humans as well.42 In Barbauld's lifetime, while English culture remained strongly anthropo centric, animal "feeling"?a conflation of physical sensation and emotion?took on unprecedented importance.43 More people insisted that to inflict needless suf fering on animals was "wrong regardless of whether or not it [had] any human consequences." Like Tristram Shandy's uncle Toby, who spares a fly's life, sensi tive persons decided that even unpopular creatures such as snakes, toads, and spiders deserve respect, and some expressed qualms about killing insects or catch ing mice in traps.44 Throughout Barbauld's writings, a menagerie of beset birds, cats, dogs, and other "small vulnerable animals" provides company for the furry captive of "The Mouse's Petition." 45 Barbauld and Aikin's Evenings at Home contains many pieces that imagine the world from animal characters' viewpoints. In "The Trans migrations of Indur," for example, a kind man realizes his wish to become differ ent animals with "rational souls" and memory, whereupon he experiences first hand the dangers and pr?dations of animal existence.46 These stories clearly imply that living things exist for their own reasons, not merely for human exploitation. That message is propounded explicitly in the dialogue "What Animals are Made For," in which a father exhorts his young daughter not to kill flies simply because she finds them annoying: [T]he Creator equally desires the happiness of all his creatures, and looks down with as much benignity upon these flies that are sporting around us, as upon ourselves. . . . We have a right to make a reasonable use of all animals for our advantage, and also to free ourselves from such as are hurtful to us. So far our superiority over them may fairly extend. But we should never abuse them for our mere amusement, nor take away their lives wantonly. . . . An infant may destroy life, but all the kings upon earth cannot restore it.47 If destroying flies was questionable, it is not surprising that disapproval attached to experiments on animals. Such experimentation had played a key role, since the Renaissance, in advancing knowledge about anatomy, physiology, and medicine. In the seventeenth century, vivisection?that is, dissection or other sur gical procedures performed on living animals for research or teaching?had been involved in such fundamental discoveries as the "lacteals," or lymphatic system, and circulation of the blood. By the eighteenth century, animal experiments were generating controversy outside the scientific community. Defenders of vivisection argued that the knowledge gained was unavailable through other methods and that, as creatures without reason, animals could be treated as objects with no moral claim on humans.48 In Jonathan Swift's satire of speculative science in Gulliv er's Travels, indignities perpetrated on a dog serve to lambaste experimental prac tices as crude and preposterous, without necessarily implying sympathy for the dog. Other writers, more respectful of science in general, weighed the potential benefits of research against its costs in harm to animals. The Spectator and the Gentleman's Magazine declared vivisection pointless and unnecessary as well as cruel, while Alexander Pope questioned the "right" to kill animals even for med ical discoveries important to human health.49 A particularly strong indictment appeared in Samuel Johnson's Idler in 1758. Although Johnson usually followed</page><page sequence="10">56 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/1 science with enthusiasm, in this essay he expressed "abhorrence" for "the infer iour professors of medical knowledge"?a "race of wretches," he declared, "whose favourite amusement is to nail dogs to tables and open them alive; to try how long life may be continued in various degrees of mutilation, or with the excision or laceration of the vital parts .... if the knowledge of physiology has been somewhat encreased, he surely buys knowledge dear, who learns the use of the lacteals at the expence of his humanity."50 The phrase "at the expence of humanity" must have resonated with Jo seph Priestley, for it appeared some nine years later in his account of his own work. Priestley performed "a great number of experiments on animals," begin ning with the research discussed in his History of the Present State of Electricity. These experiments earned him some distinction: according to Benjamin Franklin, "Animals larger and more difficult to kill, appear to have been killed by the doc tor's Apparatus, than by any other before used."51 But the History also betrays Priestley's ambivalence, even distaste, about this aspect of his work. Narrating his study of the physiological effects of lightning strikes, Priestley describes his sub jection of a rat, a shrew, cats, and dogs to electric shock and the resulting "vio lent" convulsions and other disturbing effects. In one instance, to spare a cat so treated from a "lingering death," Priestley was moved to administer a "second stroke" to put the creature out of its misery. When he tried a larger shock on the head of a dog, "all his [the animal's] limbs were extended, he fell backwards, and lay without any motion, or sign of life, for about a minute." After half an hour of convulsions, the dog "kept discharging a great quantity of saliva; and there was also a great flux of rheum from his eyes, on which he kept putting his feet; though in other respects he lay perfectly listless." The dog survived in this condition until the next day, when Priestley "dispatched [him], by shooting him through the hinder part of his head."52 Priestley expresses explicit doubts about these methods in connection with the dramatic result of an experiment on a frog. He had dissected the frog's thorax to observe its heartbeat, then administered an electric shock: "Upon receiving the stroke, the lungs were instantly inflated; and, together with the other contents of the thorax, thrown quite out of the body." After some tentative movements, "at last the creature seemed as if it would have come to life, if it had not been so much mangled." In an uneasy echo of Johnson, Priestley concludes that "it is paying dear for philosophical discoveries, to purchase them at the expence of humani ty."53 Barbauld probably knew about these episodes from reading the History, if not from firsthand observation. At Warrington, Priestley performed his experi ments in an outbuilding near his house; he welcomed witnesses, and it seems likely he would discuss his work with Barbauld and other friends. Even if Bar bauld did not witness any experiments in person, she may have heard their audi ble results?such an explosion of mixed gases on one occasion that, according to Priestley, "burst a glass and had like to have done me a mischief."54 Mice entered Priestley's lab in the early 1770s when, undertaking the work that led to his isolation of oxygen, he sought "a farther insight into the constitution of the atmosphere."55 Curious about the differences between ordi nary and "noxious" air, Priestley determined that a "full-grown mouse" enclosed in a glass vessel of "common air" could survive for "about a quarter of an hour."</page><page sequence="11">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 57 He then placed mice in vessels of air mixed with various contaminants and ob served the effects on their respiration, as well as the effects of their breathing on the contained air. In what vivisection opponents would doubtless call adding in sult to injury, Priestley studied, among other things, the effects on live mice of breathing air that was "generated solely from putrefying mice, which I have been collecting some months, than which nothing can be more deadly."56 It was while he was thus engaged that Barbauld placed her poem of animal advocacy in a mouse's cage, where it was discovered "after breakfast," THE "FELLOWSHIP OF SENSE": "THE MOUSE'S PETITION" Infiltrating the workspace of experiment via the domestic spaces of Priestley's home, "The Mouse's Petition" brings the cultures of science and sensibility into intimate proximity. Neither strictly public nor strictly private, Priestley's house cum-laboratory may qualify as Harriet Guest's "third site" of social exchange, an arena where private interactions could incubate public virtues.57 The mouse's postprandial plea is a compact rhetorical performance that deftly weaves a cri tique of Priestley's work with the playful wit of the light occasional poem and a web of allusion to the serious debate about animals. The poem deploys two cul turally powerful apparatus, the language of feeling and anthropomorphic ven triloquism, to imagine a sentient but subject creature as an effective speaking subject. To begin with the critique of vivisection, though the mouse's entrapment can certainly symbolize human bondage, its immediate poignancy arises from the literal details of Priestley's method. The mouse's sighing is not only a convention of sentimental literature; it also puns on the fact that the actual mouse may suffo cate. The captive's desire for "the vital air" (line 21) is thus quite literal as well. Further, its assertion that light and air are "common gifts" (line 24) plays on Priestley's references to "common air"?air both ordinary and meant to be shared by all: The chearful light, the vital air, Are blessings widely given; Let nature's commoners enjoy The common gifts of heaven, (lines 21-4) The "Petition" takes advantage of the "overlapping rhetorical strategies" noted by Ann Van Sant in narratives of suffering and scientific accounts: like Priestley's experiment, Barbauld's poem "isolates] the creature and mak[es] it suffer."58 The poet literalizes the conventional scene of sensibility in humanitarian and literary texts?the display and scrutiny of a representative feeling captive?to figure the distress of an actual flesh-and-blood victim. Elaborating on Barbauld's warning that "Virtue" is more desirable than intellectual "eminence," the poem casts a dubious eye on the manipulation of weaker creatures. The mousetrap's "wiry grate" is associated with the "tyrant's chain," which Priestley ordinarily would "spurn," and with the traps of fate that threaten "men, like mice" (lines 6, 10, 48, 46). The mouse thus joins the dreamer of Barbauld's "Hill of Science" in raising moral rectitude above callous or soul less scientific achievement. In place of ambition, the "Petition's" language of feel</page><page sequence="12">58 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/1 ing seeks to ignite Priestley's sympathetic imagination: the mouse appeals not only to its captor's head but to his "breast" or heart, which the mouse implores him to open so he may open the trap (line 9). The "well taught philosophic mind" should be more, not less, compassionate to other creatures; indeed, it should feel "for all that lives" (lines 26, 28). The mouse's plea is concerned not so much with prospective bodily discomfort as with the painful emotions it already feels: "For here forlorn and sad I sit, / . . . And tremble at th' approaching morn, / Which brings impending fate" (lines 5, 7-8). The desired response is that modeled in Barbauld's later poem "The Caterpillar," in which the speaker's recognition of her kinship with a "helpless thing" makes her "feel and clearly recognise / .. . [its] fellowship of sense with all that breathes" (Poem 133, lines 1, 25-7). In this approach Barbauld allies herself with other writers, such as Anne Finch and Anna Seward, who imagined animal subjectivity in human terms. G. J. Barker-Benfield asserts that women writers in particular, who found themselves "vulnerable" and "dependent" in a culture dominated by men, "put themselves 'in the place' of animals" even more than they did that of poor people, prisoners, slaves, or other intended beneficiaries of reform.59 Women's texts about animals, says Margaret Anne Doody, "mix humour and compassion with a strong sense of the immediate and physical as the speaker projects herself . . . into the being" of another creature.60 In adopting the mouse's subject position, Barbauld's "Peti tion" anticipates her admonishment in Hymns in Prose for Children that humans must speak on behalf of "dumb" nature.61 In addition to its literary genealogy, the "Petition" is also descended from philosophical debates about humans' relationship with other creatures. From time to time in Western history, opponents of cruelty have countered the argument that animals lack mind or spirit by hypothesizing that they may have "rational souls"62?a notion that implies both reasoning power and the potential for an afterlife. In this vein, the mouse warns Priestley: If mind, as ancient sages taught, A never dying flame, Still shifts thro' matter's varying forms, In every form the same, Beware, lest in the worm you crush A brother's soul you find; And tremble lest thy luckless hand Dislodge a kindred mind, (lines 29-36) A few commentators on animal welfare believed in the transmigration of souls, as did Priestley for a short time, and Barbauld's mouse craftily uses the scientist's former belief against him.63 The animal may, after all, be a kindred spirit who shares the fellowship not only of "sense" or feeling but also that of mind. The mouse draws on philosophical issues in other ways. It backs up its appeal to Priestley's sympathy with an argument older than the interest in ani mals' feelings: the consequences to humans of their own cruelty. The mouse wish es the scientist "health," "peace," and "heartfelt ease" if he spares its life (lines 42, 43). Conversely, and more ominously, it hints at what may happen if he does not: "when destruction lurks unseen, / Which men, like mice, may share," there</page><page sequence="13">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 59 may be no "kind angel" around to "break the hidden snare" for Priestley (lines 45-8). The poem thus affirms human-animal kinship with playful irony by re minding Priestley that what happens to the mouse can easily happen to the man. RESISTING THE TECHNOLOGY OF ENTRAPMENT The caged mouse is not the only natural entity in Barbauld's poems en snared by human machinery. Other creatures, as well as energy bearing forces such as rivers and lightning, share the mouse's predicament, confined or chan neled by technology. In "To Mrs. P[riestley]," a pheasant caught in a "wiry net" feels "Oppress'd by bondage" and longs, like the mouse in its grate, for liberty (Poem 3, lines 51, 54). The prose poem "Epitaph on a Goldfinch" mourns a freedom-loving bird abducted by the "pitiless hands of a two-legged animal with out feathers" and "confined in a grated prison." The goldfinch's repeated "peti tion for redress" goes disregarded until at last the bird dies.64 In other poems, as in "The Mouse's Petition," natural entities yearn for release from scientific gad gets wielded by Priestleyesque projectors. Priestley's self-confessed "enthusiasm" for natural philosophy arose in part from his delight in "philosophical instruments." In the History of Electricity he recommends financing equipment purchases by spending less money on books, "which are generally read and laid aside, without yielding half the entertainment." Instruments provide "an endless fund of knowledge" and reveal nothing less than the "operations ... of the God of nature himself, which are infinitely various. By the help of these machines, we are able to put an endless variety of things into an endless variety of situations." Nature does not always cooperate, however, and that recalcitrance creates a need for substantial resources, especially experimental apparatus: "Nature will not be put out of her way, and suffer her materials to be thrown into all the variety of situations, which philosophy requires, . . . without trouble and expence."65 In this struggle between the "requirements" of natural philosophy and a stubborn feminine nature, Barbauld's poems may be rooting for the latter. Several of them concern devices contrived to manipulate natural forces, but those devices dominate phenomena only for a time. In "Inscription for an Ice-House," the sea son of winter is imprisoned by "man, the great magician," who molds the ele ments to his will and presses winter into the domestic service of preserving food (Poem 95, lines 4-5). The Montgolfier brothers' hot-air balloon, an exciting in vention that appears in "Washing-Day," enables men to harness warm air and elude gravity (Poem 102). "An Inventory of the Furniture in Dr. Priestley's Study" lists among the scientist's equipment Leyden jars containing electric charges (Poem 21, line 19). Like the icehouse, these devices are manmade, that is, specifically masculine; as Isobel Armstrong asserts, the phrase "man, the great magician" "surely [signifies] the masculine subject alone."66 Like the "resistless" men who "control the genius of th'unwilling flood" in Barbauld's "The Invitation," all these technologies of entrapment seek to appropriate the creatures and powers of (usually) feminine nature. These poems share the ineradicable ambivalence of Barbauld's other texts about science. In general they approvingly treat inventions like the icehouse and the hot-air balloon as instruments of progress that will better the human condi</page><page sequence="14">60 Eighteenth-Century Studies 37/1 tion. But the mastery that these technologies represent entails a price, the poems imply, in the uncertainty of what trapped phenomena, "oppress'd by bondage," may do. Winter is confined in the icehouse only temporarily and will inevitably escape "To rush in whirlwinds forth, and rule the year" (line 31). The hot-air balloon in "Washing-Day"?whose first, experimental passengers were three do mestic animals67?could crash or go awry. The poem wryly deflates, as it were, the balloonists' triumph, an instance of "the toils of men" that resemble "the sports of children" (Poem 102, line 84), The lightning in Priestley's laboratory "phials" could wreak havoc in the neighborhood, like the exploding gases that once almost did him "a mischief." Like a rogue spirit, if released these electric charges could "Bring down the lightning on [the neighbors'] houses, / And kill their geese, and fright their spouses" (Poem 21, lines 16, 21, 23-4). In these texts, experimental gadgetry disrupts or threatens domestic tranquility and normalcy? such as the women's work in "Washing-Day"?as well as the lives of helpless creatures. Elaborating on the problematic entrapment in "The Mouse's Petition," these images of incarcerated nature call into question a headlong optimism about aggressive technocracy?an optimism that, paradoxically, Barbauld was inclined to share. BARBAULD'S DISCLAIMER AND THE "PETITION'S" RECEPTION Although William Turner reports that the "Petition" moved Priestley to free one particular mouse, the philosopher continued to use mice in his work with gases until at least 1775 (then, citing imprecise results, he decided "not to make any more experiments with mice"),68 The reading public, in contrast, took the poem's antivivisection implications more to heart. At the same time, Barbauld's dialogue with critics further exposes unresolved conflicts in her attitudes. The Critical Review, treating the poem as an attack on Priestley, amended its subtitle to say sarcastically that the petition was found by "the humane Dr. P." (emphasis in original). Evidently familiar with Priestley's work on electricity, the reviewer misreported that the mouse had been caught "to be tortured by electrical experi ments," not for experiments with gases. The writer went on to "commend the lady's humanity for endeavouring to extricate the little wretch from misery" and to "testify our abhorrence of the cruelty practised by experimental philosophers."69 Similarly, The Monthly Review desired that "The Mouse's Petition" would "be of service to that gentleman [Priestley] as well as other experimental philosophers, who are not remarkable for their humanity to the poor harmless animals, that are so ill-fated as to fall in their way."70 In later editions of her Poems, Barbauld distanced herself from faultfinding over Priestley's experiments. A note in the third, fourth, and fifth editions reads, "The Author is concerned to find, that what was intended as the petition of mercy against justice, has been construed as the pleas of humanity against cruelty. She is certain that cruelty could never be apprehended from the Gentleman to whom this is addressed; and the poor animal would have suffered more as the victim of domestic economy, than of philosoph ical curiosity."71 Barbauld's backpedaling here is puzzling. Her implication that it was "jus tice" to experiment with the mouse undercuts the poem's message of sympathy.</page><page sequence="15">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 61 On the other hand, the poet may have been not merely "concerned" but horrified to see her good friend condemned in print as "not remarkable for [his] humani ty." Her note may be a defense against such a perception as much as a disclaimer about the intent of the "Petition." (She may also be dryly hinting that animal sympathy, as a practical matter, has its limits: just as the mouse would have been killed as a pest, most people would not hesitate to exterminate vermin in their homes.) Decades later, after Barbauld's death, Turner's account of the poem's gen esis reproduced her efforts at damage control, possibly out of loyalty to the Aikin circle. Like Barbauld, Turner represents Priestley's use of mice as unavoidable and treats their fate in the lab as relatively humane: "no more easy or unexceptionable way of making such experiments [on gases] could be devised, than the reserving of these little victims of domestic economy, which were thus at least as easily and as speedily put out of existence, as by any of the more usual modes."72 For many other readers, "The Mouse's Petition" clearly asserts a humble creature's right to exist unmolested by human machinations. Possibly by way of Burns's "To a Mouse," variations on the phrase "men, like mice" have become shorthand, an equation representing humans' and other animals' shared vulnerability to the vi cissitudes of an uncertain world.73 Barbauld's anxiety about the poem's reception speaks to the final irrec oncilability of the tensions in her dialogue with Priestley. Knowledge is desirable, both writers agree, but the costs of knowledge?in animal suffering, in manipula tion of nature, in "trouble and expence"?are high. Discovering "Truth" at the expense of compassion and "humanity" is a purchase disturbingly "dear," as Priestley had put it. In the end, "The Mouse's Petition" is neither a definitive pronouncement on animal experiments nor a broadside attack on science, but a nonce utterance provoked by a caged animal at Priestley's "hospitable board" (Poem 19, line 40). Mock-serious though its tone may be, this slight poem about a small mammal is a nexus of more epochal phenomena: experimental science, the culture of sensibility, advocacy for animals, and the gendered politics of knowl edge. A sidelong subversion of Enlightenment technocracy, "The Mouse's Peti tion" is a scene of engagement among competing but interdependent discourses struggling to come to terms with the material world and with its meanings for thinking, feeling women and men.

The Aikin circle was connected with the coterie of naturalist-writers that included Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White. John Aikin was a friend of Pennant, whose British Zoology Barbauld may have known; see McCarthy and Kraft, Poems, 334, 224. In 1795 Aikin edited a Calendar of Nature gleaned from White's naturalist's journals and Natural History of Selb orne, and he brought out the book's second edition in 1802. These collaborations suggest that Barbauld had ample access to natural history knowledge. 19. Aikin, Memoir, xxv. 20. Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb, ed. Edwin W. Marrs Jr. (Ithaca: Cornell Univ.

Barbauld's and Aikin's works also reproduce conservative expectations about the gendered pursuit of knowledge. Unlike the dialogues led by female mentors in the works of Trimmer, Wakefield, Wollstonecraft, and others, most of the natural history dialogues in Evenings at Home feature boy protagonists identifying specimens for adult male teachers. While girls are depicted studying gravity and the movements of the earth, equally often they learn lessons of moral virtue, including compassion for animals. Judging by Lucy Aikin's attributions, John Aikin probably wrote most of the natural history dialogues in Evenings at Home; see Memoir, xxxvi-xxvii.

Barbauld is marking the difference between ac quiring and producing knowledge; in addition, any avocation that would distract women from their domestic "professional knowledge" is problematic. Priestley's scientific work was not without diffi culties; he labored constantly to get financing, equipment, and coll?gial support. His experiments were subject to criticism and sometimes ridicule, but he was not criticized for violating gender norms as an aspiring woman scientist would likely have been. 34.

For here forlorn and sad I sit, Within the wiry grate; And tremble at th' approaching morn, Which brings impending fate. If e'er thy breast with freedom glow'd, And spurn'd a tyrant's chain, Let not thy strong oppressive force A free-born mouse detain. Oh! do not stain with guiltless blood Thy hospitable hearth; Nor triumph that thy wiles betray'd A prize so little worth. The scatter'd gleanings of a feast My frugal meals supply; But if thine unrelenting heart That slender boon deny, The chearful light, the vital air, Are blessings widely given; Let nature's commoners enjoy The common gifts of heaven. The well taught philosophic mind To all compassion gives; Casts round the world an equal eye, And feels for all that lives. If mind, as ancient sages taught, A never dying flame, Still shifts thro' matter's varying forms, In every form the same, Beware, lest in the worm you crush A brother's soul you find; And tremble lest thy luckless hand Dislodge a kindred mind. Or, if this transient gleam of day Be all of life we share, Let pity plead within thy breast That little all to spare.</page><page sequence="21">Bellanca / Anna Barbauld's "The Mouse's Petition" 67 So may thy hospitable board With health and peace be crown'd; And every charm of heartfelt ease Beneath thy roof be found. So, when destruction lurks unseen, Which men, like mice, may share, May some kind angel clear thy path, And break the hidden snare.</page></plain_text>
