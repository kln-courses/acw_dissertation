<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mongolian Representations of the Body Gaelle Lacaze (Translated with Ophélia Bailles) NANTERRE The body is a "natural object" from which cultural representations are drawn. According to M.-L. Beffa and R. Hamayon, in a thematic analysis on the "figures of the body," it appears as a preferred medium for the study of the function of symbolization (Beffa and Hamayon 1 989). The body supplies images allowing it to represent other empirical categories. So, there are many outward manifestations of body categories through space and conversely, outward manifestations of spatial categories on the body. The body should be allowed to reveal the symbolic system of representations of a society, from a diachronic point of view but also from its synchronic diversity. It has a specific place in the relationship to the world and plays a particular role in the organization of human society. Nonetheless, one may wonder, for all that, if there is a microcosm-to- macrocosm relationship between the body and the universe, if the symbolic categories of space are anthropomorphic, or even if the symbolic categories of the body are imagined through spatial terminology. Gaelle Lacaze defended her Ph.D. in June, 2000, in the program of comparative ethnology and sociology at Nanterre University under the direction of Roberte Hamayon. The author would like to express her thanks to Ophélia Bailles who assisted in translating this article.</page><page sequence="2">44 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) In the representations related to the body, the categories which represent the body (as a microcosm or a medium of several cultural or social values) are distinguished from the ones which use the concept of the body to shape other data (kinship, space, health, social rank, etc.). The relationship between the symbolic representations of the body and the ones which use its patterns to signify other data underlines several different views of the meanings of the body. According to the Mongolian context, the symbolic meanings of the body supply arguments to these both meanings. This article is founded on several sources, both bibliographical and ethnographical.1 The "Mongolian symbolic categories of the spatial area do not borrow their terminology from the human body and do not reconstruct the world through its pattern" (Beffa and Hamayon 1983).2 While the spatial categories are not borrowed from the human body, the body is used as an instrument of positioning and is useful to localize something in space. In fact, it supplies referential unities to calculate distances. For example, an alt defines the distance between the two hands while arms are outstretched and hung upon a vertical axis (Aubin 1970). Moreover, like the macrocosm, it is an universe into which harmony is a vital question, as along an internal point of view as well as along an external one, even through its relationship to the world. In this meaning, physiological pathology is related to several systems of interpretation. Sickness is a disturbance of the microcosmic harmony, or even a result of macrocosmic disturbance, or eventually, a disturbance of harmony in both these dimensions. These examples could feed a hypothesis about the relationship between macrocosm and microcosm, and on the use of body categories into the spatial representations, with its corollary, movement. Furthermore, Mongolian societies are among those Asiatic societies which conceptualize kinship in terms of "bone and blood." This is a supplementary argument for seriously examining the symbolic representations of the body in such societies. The general purpose of this article is to show that, among the Mongols, the symbolic representations and the uses of body are an important Several journeys organized according to the Franco-Mongolian exchange agreements by the French Foreign Affairs Ministry constitute the field-work base from which these data come. 2Mongolian spatial meanings, studied through their linguistic expressions and their symbolic uses, seem to act by binary oppositions in which one of the referential poles always has a primary position. They function also in other fields, such as that of relationships or that of moral or temporal values. In fact, the body has to be understood through the concept of space whose corollary is the concept of movement.</page><page sequence="3">LACAZE 45 line of approach that highlights cultural representations of the universe, through both its natural and social structure. In the traditional meaning of the body, the references to animals and to the occupation of the land illustrate a structure of complementarity and a mobility in space. These two modes of pastoral nomadism are the most important components of the human being's relationship to the macrocosm. The body is introduced into nomadic conceptions related to shamanistic representations in the context of stock-breeding. At this level, some patterns evidence Buddhist influences. The analysis of those body terminologies allows us to delineate Mongolian symbolic representations of the person, which can in turn throw light on foreign influences related to those representations. Thus, the linguistic analysis of the term biye underlines the components of the body related to pastoral shamanism, those related to Tibetan-rite Buddhism, and those related to a more rationalized system defining the notion of the "person." The relationships between "body/domestic space/universe," where the connection with animals is decisive, appear fundamental for the analysis of corporeal microcosm. In this context, the Mongolian conceptions of the body appear as a complex correspondence of several components related to ideologies such as shamanism, Tibetan-rite Buddhism, Chinese cultural patterns, and even Soviet atheism. The corporeal patterns of the Mongolian society testify to a system of knowledge where several systems of knowledge and several ideologies, sometimes antagonistic, have been superimposed on more traditional patterns. Thus, the purpose of this article is to show the successive linguistic rebuildings of those categories of the body among Mongolian cultures. (The dictionaries used in this article are listed at the end of the bibliography.) I. Mongolian Concepts of the "Body." In Khalkha Mongolian, the body is called biye , (bey-e in the Uighur script and beve in Buriat.3 Usually it has four main meanings: "organic body," "physical health," the concept of "person," and "side," or "bank" (of a river, etc.). So, the "person" biye means, among Mongolian languages, the concrete manifestation of an individual entity and denotes the moral value of the subject (as will be noted below, this is somewhat different from Mauss's conception of 3Terms taken from the Cyrillic alphabet of Mongolia are given in plain italics. Those taken from Uighur script are given in bold-faced italics , while terms transcribed from Buriat are in underlined italics</page><page sequence="4">46 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) the "person"). The person referred to by the words " my body " is shown by a body in life because of the existence of both vital energy and soul. The "soul" is the symbolic entity which may be nourished and needs to have a body. Without a "body," souls should be called "spirits." The "vital energy" means the principle of life, flowing in the body of both animals and human beings and which they exchange. This component corresponds to the marrow (Hamayon: 1990: 549). Each aspect designated by this term biye has a semantic sense and a proper lexical use. In fact, the sense given to morphemes composed by the term "body" has a meaning itself. Moreover, it acquires other meanings under distinct speaking contexts, lexical parentheses, so to speak, which underline precise nuances. In this context, oral literature constitutes a rich starting point for establishing the meaning of the Mongolian corporeal concept. Linguistic binomials, when they are used, as well as the derivations built from this morpheme, refer to the growth of the body, its physical appearance and its materiality. They also signify the health understood as "body harmony" and, less often, as the concept of person. The "body" is defined as a natural and living physical medium. It is valorized in its materiality, and in its concrete existence in an accomplished medium. It is not solely for human beings and is used to designate every living organism. This real and finished "body" generates, along these lines, the "person." Among Mongolian languages, "my body" signifies the first singular personal pronoun with the meaning of "me, I." Perhaps a linguist should investigate the phonologic relationship between the use of "W" meaning "I, me" - which is realized only for the first personal pronoun in place of the phoneme "mi" like "minu, manar - and the concept of "my body" (" bey-e "). Ultimately, given life by the soul of the person, the body is valorized through its growth, its social production, and reproduction. I. A. Biye as a Specific Life Medium. In several contexts, the term biye denotes positive or negative states of health. Some simpler locutions distinguish the honorary use of "corporeal health" {biye lagšin ) and the more popular one "in good health" (biye saitai) whose corollary is "in bad health" ( biye muutai). "Corporeal looseness, corporeal vacancy " (biye sul) denotes a sickly, puny state of health. I. A. 1. Completion. The constitution of the body is shown by locutions like "appareance of the body" (biye byaldar ), "living body" (amidv beve), "organic body" (biye maxbod</page><page sequence="5">LACAZE 47 or even biye bodis) or even "corporeal complex" ( biye cogc). In Buriat language, the locution "body-biceps" denotes both muscular structure and health (šandaaha beve). The "body" is used in many Khalkha locutions meaning "to be aching" or "tired body" (biye šawxirax), "exhausted body " (biye newšlex) or even "stiffened body" (biye xösix ). In lexical uses, the term biye meaning alone, by itself, "health," is current. In fact, the usual question to wonder about a person's state of health is "Is the body good?/Is your health good?" (biyee sain uul). The locution "the body fades" (biye jailax) underlines a serious problem of health. The notion of health among Mongolian languages defined by the term "body" (biye) thus tends to point out the harmony of the body and its components. In this context, the body's states are defined in relation to the concept of "normal harmony" and through the excess or even the lack, in relation to this primordial "harmony." The body in good health looks muscular, a state which becomes apparent in its great physical presence. The locution "physical training" literally "corporeal energy" (biyeiin tamir ) throws light on this aspect. Thus, the body is associated with musculature and physical strength. It is defined as the completion of the biological body. I. A. 2. Whole Reality in Its Completion. The verb biyelex derived from the noun biye "body" valorizes the physical body in its aspects of growth and completion. It takes the meaning of "to mature, to constitute to form, to be adult, to grow" and is furnished suffixed to mean dancing the "corporeal dance" (biyelgee). It refers to the health of the physiological body and to the person as individual entity. Concurrently, locutions like "body's transformation" (biye bolowsrox ) and "body's reaching" (biye xiirex) translated by "to mature, to become adult" underline the growth of the body. The use of these locutions with the meaning of "to mature" appears less prevalent than other locutions like "the body grows too large" (biye tomdox). In Buriat language, this aspect of the formation, the completion, the maturity and the growth of the body is more current than in the Khalkha language. This appears clearly in the locution "body desired" (bevee xüsehen) which means "adult" or in "horse with a body" (bevetei morin) meaning "adult horse." In this locution, there is an analogy between human body and the horse's body. In Mongolian languages, through locutions of maturity or even growth, the body is defined as a finished and complete entity. If the adult horse is called by the locution "horse with a body," then, in this case, the "body" means "completed body" and its maturity is stressed. The meaning of the term</page><page sequence="6">48 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) "body" in its semantic use, "completed body," as a concrete and finished object, is especially developed among terms derived from the linguistic root biye. I. B. Turning the Term "Body" into a Reality. The genitive case of the term "body" (biyeiin) translated into "corporeal" denotes a "physical" but also the "personal" component. The derivations "solid, sound, constitution, adult, strong, big-bodied, stout, fleshy, meaty" ( biyeleg , biyerxeg , biyerxM) mean completed, finished, succeeded body in the sense of the organic completion of this biological entity, that of its physical health, and eventually, in the sense of adult person. The term is sometimes used with the pejorative meaning of "domineering, overbearing." I. B. 1. The Body as Either a Completed or a Fragmented Entity. The dative-locative and comitative cases "with a body," "in the body" ( biyet or biyetei) are used with the meaning of "physical, real, effective." The deverbal noun biyelelt derived from the denominal verb (biyelex) and its passive form (biyelegdex) mean "being realized, completed, to have concrete results." This nuance is also evidenced in the causative verb form ( biyelüülex ) which means "to make something realized, to materialize, to take shape," and also in the deverbal noun derived from the causative verb form (- biyelüülelt ), meaning "accomplishment, realization, fulfilment." The causative verb form has also the meaning of "perform the corporeal dance" ( biyelgee ), a Mongolian dance characterized primarily by motions of the body. The sense of physical reality given to the word "body" is used to denote the materiality or the concrete aspect, the real being of something, as, for example, in the Buriat locution "money-body" (biye möngö) which means "money, liquidity, cash." In Buriat, the use of the term "body" in order to denote the materiality or the concrete part of something is more current than in Khalkha because of the meaning taken by the instrumental + reflexive-possessive case of the terme biye. Beveeree takes the meaning of agreement, of "this one" or "that one," "this time," "at this moment..." according to its context. In fact, the "big body" (ix biye ) means the skeleton. The "complete body " (xöwcin biye) in Khalkha language and its equivalent in Buriat language the "incomplete body" (muxar beve ) denotes the "chest, torso, trunk." The "body of the chest" (ceefiin biye), or in Buriat language (seežee beve Ì. means the "chest." The "back of the body" ( bögsön biye), the "fulfilled body " or even "athletic body" (biixe beve' in Buriat, means the "back." This term biye is used to describe one of the body's parts, to distinguish the front from the back, the</page><page sequence="7">LACAZE 49 upper half from the lower half, or to evoke a material entity cut into pieces. In this context of analogy, it is used to define one of the banks, one of the two sides or faces of something, like for example, the bank of a river. The meaning of "side, face, bank" is another peculiar meaning of the use of the "body." This specific use of biye in accordance with the sense of "bank" is used to denote the materiality of the complete body or just a part of it. With the meaning of "side, bank," the body is shown as physical and partial entity. So, the Mongolian term meaning the body, biye , underlines materiality of something expressed in its fulfilment, its completion, or else in being cut out into pieces. The derivation from the fulfilled body to the partial body, cut out into pieces, is acted out by métonymie process, the most widely-used logical process among Mongolian culture. I. B. 2. The Individual Body. The uses of the term "body -biye" to denote the concept of" person " are diversified. In some locutions, it is used with its "personal" meaning and thus, can introduce one's relationship with another individual. The "human body" (biye xiiri) names the individual. The possessive and reflexive-possessive cases, "my body" or "own body" (minii biye or biyee ) are used to express "my person ," and thus have received the meaning of "me, myself." The reflexive-dative case, "in my body" (biyedee) means "myself, oneself." The instrumental case, "by my body" (biyeer) is used in the sense of "personally." The dative case "corporeal" (biyed) signifies " for itself, on one's behalf." It is used with the lexicalized meaning of "each other, separately." For example, the locution "into one's body with someone else's body" (biye biyedee) or even the "my body with one' s body" (biye biyee) means "each other, respectively." So in the context of a reciprocal relationship, each individual person can be defined by its respective body. Concurrently, another use of the term "body" is found in some Buriat locutions: "body children" (aša beve) or even "body fruits" (Uri beve) which denote "my children, my descendants." Those locutions make visible the semantic field covered up by the word bive/beve according to its meaning as "myself, my person." In several lexical uses of the term "body" one meets other usages in which the notion of "person" is present. For example, the unmarried person is "man with single body" (ganc biye xiiri). Concurrently, to live by one's self or be independent is called "to depend on one's body, to depend on oneself' (biyee daax). The denominal verbal forms of "biye" especially in the modal converb form (biyečilex, biyečleri) derived from the particle which means</page><page sequence="8">50 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) "completion" (c, čix) define the person pointing out its own body. They are translated by " to do personally, individually, by oneself," respectively. Here, the finished and completed body allows the expression of the socialized person. The locution "to correct one's body, to rectify oneself' (jbiye jasax) is related to two techniques of body care, to wit "to be careful of oneself," or "to relieve oneself." It occurs with the maintenance of biologic and social harmony in the body, in order to fit into the frame of both personal and collective balance. I. B. 3. The "Bodiless Ones." The term "body" used in the sense of a material medium appears in the comitative case "with a body" (biyetei) meaning both "strong, sound," or even "concrete, physical" and, in some peculiar contexts, "adult." In this case, its antonym is "bodyless" (biyegiii) which means "small, weak." Kowalewski also gives another meaning to this term; "bodyless" (bey-e iigei ) means "incorporeal, unsubstantial" and also "demons." Accounting for that Mongolist' s Judeo- Christian way of thinking allows one to transcend this meaning in order to accept a deeper one such as "evils" or simply "spirits of the dead." The "insubstantiality" underlines the concept of spirit. Among Mongolian shamanist symbolic representations influenced by Tantric Buddhism, spirits are imagined as "bodyless entities" made of "wind and air." So, "bodyless" means both the "insubstantiality" of spirits and also sickness: "to have a weak body," "to be puny." This privative use underlines the "body" as a physical entity full of vital energy. Here, the concept of death as the state of sickness is understood as different levels of absence of vital energy. The term "body" is used to denote the completed and fulfilled materiality of one's organism. In this meaning, it is in opposition to entities of the supernatural world, called the "bodyless ones." So in the Mongolian language, the body appears as the material component of the person, or the medium of the soul. If, the absence of the body defines, among other things, the spirits of the supernatural world, then the person appears in itself as a living and human representation of the soul, composed of a physical body and also a symbolic entity. In this context, it is more than a material part of the soul, it is the double of the soul in the composition of the person. II. The Body in Proverbs and Riddles. Other aspects of the body appear when this object is represented in oral literature. In some pieces of oral literature, in proverbs and riddles, one can observe the body as a microcosmic frame for both spatial and social</page><page sequence="9">Lac aze si relationships. Compilations of oral literature are numerous. The most noted compiler of riddles has evidently been S.Öljiixutag. My examples have been taken from three different compilations of his: Mongol ardyn tiimen on is o go cecen wg, (Ulaanbaatar, 1991), Tiimen on É ogo, (Ulaanbaatar, 1989); Mongol ardyn onĚogo taawar (Ulaanbaatar, 1 990). In his work, unfortunately he usually does not give the original area where the riddles were compiled, or the period when they were in use. As the material to answer question of their specific area and time of use is not indicated in his books, the chosen riddles contain patterns which will allow one to develop only a general corporeal problematic. II. A. The Physical Body. The body (biye) is taken as reference in many proverbs and appears in the peculiar Mongolian proverbial genre called "triads of the universe." Riddles, both as a stereotyped metaphorical language performed in oral games and as a socially-permitted way to dodge linguistic prohibitions, used patterns borrowed from the macrocosm in order to signify parts of the fragmented body. Among triads, proverbs and riddles, the body is taken as a pattern of the macrocosm. II. A. 1. The Living Body. Corporeal maturation appears related to animal representations. In one proverb, the human age is " ten red anklebones, twenty black antelopes, thirty light-bay foal horses, forty cows with nose-pegs, fifty camels from three to five years old, sixty hooks and seventy rubbishes" (Xiinii nas = Arwan ulaan šagai , xorin xar göröös, gučin xongor daaga, döcin dörtei sar , tawin tailag temee , jaran degee, dalan nows' Öljiixutag 1990: 111, §1118). The stages that the human body goes through are highlighted by wild animal representations and, so, from the age of thirty, by domestic animal patterns. After the age of sixty, the body seems involved in relationships of consummation (i.e. "hooks," which metaphorically mean canine teeth). The evolution of the metaphors from the wild world to the domestic universe is related to the age which brings a change of status. On the other hand, the Mongolian "techniques of the body"4 underline the evolution of referential patterns of the person's expression, from a savage animality to a domestic one, and at last, to a "human animality." In another proverb, the human body is projected in space. "One's thinking (or thoughts) are on the crest while one's body is on the lower slopes of 4The study of the "techniques of the body" is the subject of my Ph.D. dissertation defended in December 1999.</page><page sequence="10">52 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) mountains" {Sanaa níxyard, biye nibeld ; Öljiixutag 1991 : 171). Thus the body is divided into its symbolic entity and its physical component. In this representation of the fragmented body, the physiological body is resting down on the foot of the hills while the human spirit is upon its top. This proverb pictures a body as cast across a vertical frame of the physical landscape, the mountains. In pastoral conceptions, the hills welcome the ancestors' souls. This is the place where men of a given social group give offerings in order to nourish the dead souls and so limit their confluences with the world of living beings. II. A. 2. The Cycle of Life and Death. In the "triads of the universe," the cycle of life is shown by analogical reasoning. For example, the "three white things of the universe" are "the teeth at birth, the hair in old age and the bones after death" ( Yörtönciin gurwan caaxan yuu we? Ösöxöd Süd neg caaxan, ötlöxöd iis neg caaxan, iixsen xoino yas neg caaxan ; Öljiixutag 1991: 117). The corporeal cycle valorizes patterns with reference to conceptions of life and reunites three different components in the quality of whiteness. The teeth, hair and bones are highlighted as media of vital energy. In this case, this similarity denotes the gradual change in the stock of vital energy possessed by the body. Moreover, the cycle of life and death is related to the representations of childhood and old age. The young baby is often presented as a foreigner who ends his journey in a family. The child's birth is illustrated by the riddle " one foreign traveler will come from an unknown place" ( Medexgüi gajraas, tanixgiii ailčin irex' Öljiixutag 1990: 111, §1 123). The symbol of the "traveling baby at the breast" refers to conceptions of the soul reincarnating after the body's death. In this context, another proverb, of doubtful origin, underlines that "the old man is gone away while the baby has come in" {Nastai xiin yawsnaa, nyalx xüüxed iij senee ; Öljiixutag 1991: 160). So, the corporeal cycle seems related to the problématique of life and death, connected with, on one hand, the gradual dissipation of vital energy and, on the other hand, the shamanist and Buddhist meanings of reincarnation. But the body also appears as a stock of patterns used to express other categories. The kinship structures are particularly obvious in the oral literature. The given concepts in reference to the body throw light on its fragmentation. II. B. The Human Body and Kinship Structures. Some riddles on hands and feet, peculiar to human beings, show a projection of patterns related to social structures on to the bodily structure.</page><page sequence="11">LACAZE 53 These riddles are interesting because several examples related to hands and feet allow us to compare different understandings of the body. II. B. 1. Filiation. In one riddle about fingers and toes, the functional metaphors are related to patrilineal filiation. In fact, they are like " the sons of Arwaaxai (who) like to work (fingers), while the ten sons of Alcaarai like to travel (toes)" (Arwaaxain arwan xüü aßlaxad durtai , Alcaaxain arwan xüü ayalaxad durtai, ; Öljiixutag 1989: 113, §7173). In this variant, the given patterns are related to agnatic filiation and refer to pastoral social organization, opposing nomadic visits to manual labor. In folktales, Alcaaxai appears as a lazy person, sometimes related to the "white old man," while Arwaaxai, which etymologically seems to refer to the concept of movement, is absent in either folktales or popular stories. One can also note one riddle about legs and arms, "the ten paternal sons are studying seriously, while the ten maternal daughters are temperamental" ( Aawyn arwan xüü a filsag, ee fiin arwan oxin erx; Öljiixutag 1 989: 1 1 3, §7 1 69). Here the body is cut into pieces along a dichotomy opposing the upper half to the lower one. The upper half refers to patrilineal line and the lower half to the matrilineal one. The corporeal pattern of the fragmented body seems to meet the frame of bilinear filiation organized into hierarchy. The metaphors about legs and arms seem to correpond to a pattern of unilineal filiation with a dominant patrilineality, related to pastoral references. II. B. 2. The Collateral Relationship. By contrast to the previous horizontal division, a riddle about the fingers of the hand divides the body vertically, separating the left hand from the right one. They are " the five older and younger brothers who have got the same name but their own body" ( Xünii xuruu/Ax düü taw, neg ißl nertei , ondoo ondoo biyetei ; Öljiixutag 1991: 55). This descriptive example unifies fingers and brothers into a métonymie relation through the law of primogeniture. In this variant, the same name relates back to the law of primogeniture and to any relation labeled as collateral or german (i.e. related as either brother and cousin), and to the division of the two hands according to the fingers' terminology. Here, the body is cut into two vertical and similar pieces, the left one and the right one. In another example, the patterns designating the fingers are related to a military structure and evoke hierarchical relationships. "The ten soldiers are white outside, while they are red inside" (, Xünii xuruu/Arwan cergiin, ar nï cagaan, övör nï ulaan; Öljiixutag 1991: 55). While this riddle may be</page><page sequence="12">54 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) understood on several levels, the pattern of the fingers is superimposed on the military structure of the ce reg "soldier." So, the given patterns of the fingers of the hand illustrate, on one part, a classificatory relationship of older brother with the younger one and, on the other hand, military qualities in order to denote a hierarchy in which they fit. Thus in riddles, references to social organization distinguish two different systems. The division of the body through the dichotomy opposing its upper and its lower part relates to the dimension of filiation where implicit gaps between cognation and agnation appear. On the other hand, the division of the body into two vertical and symmetric parts, left and right, relates to fraternity. II. B. 3. Socio-Political Organization. The body appears easily from the point of view of its internal organization. In fact, the proverb saying "For the body, the intestine (or the belly) is the lord" ( Biye bol , gedes noyon' Öljiixutag 1991 : 138). Here, the belly is introduced in a peculiar social organization. The "lord " (noyon) corresponds to a centralized structure and, the belly called by this term, suggests a body which could be the image of a feudal society. Nevertheless, the analogy could also originate from a more recent development where, concretely, the belly can represent the socialist lord digesting the fruits of the labor of "popular masses." As this proverb does not appear in other compilations of oral literature, there is room to question its current use. Another proverb establishes a parallel between the human body and the social organization. The referential structure in this context is the State. "The State has an iron face while the born body has a flesh face" ( Tör tömör nüürtei, törsön biye maxan nüürtei, ; Öljiixutag 1991 : 175). The face appears as a place where the person could be identified. The flesh defines the human being's face while iron defines the political power which is seen as anthropomorphic. In these examples, the body is used as a medium to represent a centralized political power set in a hierarchy of human references. II. C. Pastoral Environment and Modes of Subsistence. Some examples of body metaphors refer to the expression of emotions. Here, the human body is compared to the domestic animal's body. "A vengeful mind makes the body anxious while the high mountain makes the horse anxious" {Ost sanaa biyeiigjowoono, öndör uul moriigjowoono' Öljiixutag 1991: 167). This proverb puts the man and the horse on the same level in their relation to anxiety. This relationship to the animal's body, which is also called "biye" while it is</page><page sequence="13">LAC aze 55 living, and to the landscape seems to superimpose several emotional components (i.e., anxiety) and spatial patterns (i.e., high mountains). II. C. 1. Relationship to Landscape. The relationship existing between human and animal bodies appears in other proverbs. For example, "If one knows one's body (or self) one is a man, if one knows one's pastures one is a stock animal" ( Biyee medwel xiin, belčeeree medwel mat), refers to pastoral patterns (Öljiixutag 1991 : 138). In this context, the human body is compared to pastures. The pastures seem to have the same meaning for the livestock as the body has for the human beings. The relation which underlines the livestock's use of some pastures is identified with the appropriation of the body (or self) by the humans, specifically, the incorporation of habits and customs. In riddles, the head is geomorphic. "The head: On the hillock, there are seven holes" ( Tolgoi : dowon deer , doloon nüx' Öljiixutag 1990: 127, §1348). These seven holes correspond to geomorphic patterns given in another riddle. "The head: The big stone 'cow' (or lonely stone) is on the mountain, the son of this stone is a wild horse, the son of this horse is the polar star, the son of this polar star is a deep downward place, the son of this deep downwards place is a wet cave and the son of this wet cave is a fatty mouse" ( Tolgoi : Uulan deer Oxer čuluu , iixer čuluuny xüü xawtgai delden, xawtgai deldengiin xüü cox colmon, cox colmongiin xüü uruu urt, uruu urtyn xüü usan agui, usan aguin xüü toson xulgana ; Öljiixutag 1990: 127 §1354). Thus, the head appears like a place with seven holes in reference to patterns found in the environmental landscape. II. C. 2. Pastoralism. Often the human "body" refers simultaneously to domestic animal patterns, to the landscape and to social organization. The three "vile things of the universe " are "the bad saddle for the horse, the bad wife for the yurt and the bad dog for the goup of yurts" ( Gurwan šiwšigyuu we? Muu emeel moriny šiwšig, muu em geriin šiwšig, muu noxoixotyn šiwšig' Hamayon 1972: 233). Here, the human relationship to animals seems to distinguish the place of habitation from the group of yurts. In these proverbs, where the human body appears in relation to the animal one, the references to landscape and territory are implicit and partake of this relation. Another example pictures the human body in relation to eating the animal body and beliefs about its vitality. "One does not reject one's own (or one's selfs) wishes and one does not reject the femur or the pelvic bones" {Dur biyee goloxgüi, dund cömög süüjee goloxgüi' Öljiixutag 1991:</page><page sequence="14">56 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) 147). This proverb appears significant in a relationship to eating animals. The femur bone is full of marrow and according to R. Hamayon, the marrow appears as a preferential medium for the vital energy (Hamayon 1993). Thus the femur is the symbolic medium of vital energy. In the previous examples referring to the tongue or teeth, the fragmented body refers to the macrocosm from a social, economical and natural point of view. Two examples seem to exemplify a pastoral ideology related to shamanic patterns. The tongue and the teeth are a "tawny stallion with a black markings, with a fence of birches" (Xel, šiid : Xul ajarga, xusan xorootoi ), but, in other respects, they are a "reddish cow with a fence of bones" (. Xel , šiid: Ulaan iixer, yasan xorootoi ; Öljiixutag 1990: p. 132-3, §§1445, a and b). The tongue and teeth are also the "a talkative old crone with an enclosure of bones" (Xel, siid: yaria čawganc , yasan xorootoi ), and they are also a "bone fence and a word stone" (Xel, šiid: yasan xašaa, yaril culuu' Öljiixutag 1989: 108, §§7018 and 7019). In those expressions, the body patterns evolve from the conceptions of a socialized body to the conceptions of spatial organization. In another riddle, tongue and teeth appear related to a more agricultural environment as "A well of bone with iron pot" (Xel, süd : Jasan xudag, maxan xowootoi ; Öljiixutag 1989: 108, §7020). All those examples underline the movement of referential patterns used in order to denote the corporeal expression. One passes from zoomorphic categories related to pastoralism, to more anthropomorphic and geomorphic references. II. C. 3. Representation of the Macrocosm. The reference to backbones, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, seems really interesting to denote the patterns of body expression. In fact, the backbones (more specifically, the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae) are "like the saddle of the fortune-teller mirror, like the wings of a big bird, like the canine-teeth of a stallion, and like the tent of a traveller" (Seer, nuruu : tolïmergenii emeel šig, tom šuwuuny dali šig, ajarga aduuny soyoo šig, ayančxiinii maixan šig). In another variant, they are like "the wings of a bird of prey, like the saddle of a horse with hoofs, like the canine-teeth of a stallion, and like the tent of a traveller" (Seer, nuruu : turag šuvuuny dal ï šig, tuurait moriny emeel šig, ajarga aduuny soyoo šig, ayančxiinii maixan šig). They are also represented "like the wings of a black crow, like a saddle of Inner Mongolia, like the blade of the knife, and like the canine-tooth of a steed" (Seer, nuruu: doiwon xaryn dalīšig,</page><page sequence="15">LACAZE 57 dotor mongolyn emeel šig, xurc xatgany ir šig, xurdan moriny soyoo šig ; Öljiixutag 1990: 283, §§371 la, b, and c). The first two riddles refer to pastoral shamanism and to the patterns of the stallion, the big bird and the "fortune-teller" (mergeri). The second variant is more specialized with pastoral references. The third one superimposes breeding patterns and manhood, the pride of the Sino- Mongolian saddle and the shape of the crow. In those examples, several aspects acquire meaning. The thoracic and lumbar vertebrae appear with zoomorphic patterns and, in smaller dimensions, along anthropomorphic ones. In the first variant, the references to domestic animals are based on horse shapes and the reference to wild animals on a bird of prey. In the last one, the shape of the "big bird," the bird of prey, is substituted with the shape of a carrion bird, the crow. These movements illustrate how certain ideologies work on the symbolic representations of the physical environment, and accordingly on those of the body. The corporeal microcosm cut into pieces continues to be in relation to the landscape and the animals living on it, wether they are wild or domestic. Two riddles show another aspect of the lumbar vertebra. "Observed from the upper part, it is like falcon wings; observed from the side, it is like a hero's saddle; observed from its back-side, it is like the camel's crupper; observed from the front, it is like a baby billy-goat" ( Nuruu : Deerees nï xarwal, daman xarcagyn dalawčšig, dergedees nï xarwal, daičin baatryn emeel šig , xoinoos nïxarwal, xomtoi temeenii xondloi šig, urdaas nïxarwal, daiwan tana išignii šiir šig). It is also represented in the riddle "with the king's seat, with the falcon's flapping, with the artist's mind and with the elephant's tusks" (Nuruu: Xaan xiinii suudaltai, xarcaga šuwuuny deweltei, uran xiinii uxlagatai [uxaalagtai ? urlagtai ?], uxar jaany soyootoi' Öljiixutag 1990: 284, §3714 and §3715). In this last example, both variants seems to reveal corporeal patterns related to manhood and pastoral economy. The components influenced by Buddhism are obvious in the second variant, where patterns are more anthropomorphic because they are related to more clearly ideological frameworks through obvious political and artistic references. So, the body is used to refer to economic and political categories. It is set off by wild or domestic zoomorphic frameworks or even by anthropomorphic ones valorizing manhood and heroism. Moreover, the body is defined through an anthropomorphic centralized political structure. These changes first appeared under the influence of Tantric Buddhism.</page><page sequence="16">58 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) In specimens of Mongolian oral literature, the body is highlighted by categories of belonging to a macrocosm. It is defined by its cycle of life. It is introduced into kinship groups valorizing certain frameworks in reference to filiation, in ways that do not emphasize cognation, dominant patrilineality or even agnation, as well as in reference to collaterality. The biye appears like an intercessor related to landscape and animals. In this context, it is introduced into a macrocosmic structure where the nomadic pastoralism gives referential patterns. Evident in languages of the biye defined as a physiological identity, valorized through its completed materiality or fragmented one, the changes of symbolic representations of the corporeal microcosm, which happened under the influence of Buddhism and Soviet-style atheism, appear in the representations of the person's soul, the second meaning of biye . III. The Body and Symbolic Representations of the Person The "body" is the living component of the person. It is used to express the personality. It is also used as a referential pattern in order to name several surrounding spatial categories. According to its traditional meanings, biye appears as a living entity, distinguished by its fulfillment, with its very completion allowing it to be fragmented in its realization as "bank," "side." It is the double of the soul used to denote the being of this symbolical entity. The "person" appears into the being of both its components. At last, the most important point is that it expresses the living materiality of the soul, temporarily established within and also nourrished by it. III. A. "With Bones and Flesh." The first handling of individual corporeality tends to define its individual body qualities and, along the way, to denote status components of the social person. These socializations take shape in the child's group of insertion, the domestic group or "family," tend to make him participate in a particular given cultural system. This allows him to have an access to a larger sociability, to find his place into extended family kinship, and to take sense in a social and political system. A proverb current at the present in Mongolia about the human constitution says that " the bones come from the father and the flesh from the mother " ( E c gees y as ir deg, exees max ir deg). The bone symbolizes the principle of patrilineal filiation and the flesh the matrilineal one. The term "bone"</page><page sequence="17">LACAZE 59 (yas) tends to denote the group to which one belongs, while the "those of the bone" (yastan ) denotes the ethnic group, seen as formed by patrilineal descent. III. A. 1. The Theoretical Frame of Kinship. The Mongolian term iiye means both "body's joints," "period, time" and "generation." The anatomical joints thus fix the genealogical memory and allow one to define system of exchange relationships and, in this context, the limits of exogamic relations. In fact, from the ungual phalanx to the top of the head, each joint of the surmounted body parts corresponds to a genealogical level of the kinship group. Those joints are called by the name of the ancestor or by the kinship term related to its status in the kinship structure projected on the joint. In this context, marriage is forbidden for nine generations or "joints " on the patrilineal line and only for three, five, or seven generations on the matrilineal line. The human body in this structure appears as a microcosm reflecting the filiation structure into which it is introduced, from which it is built and fixed. In the segmentary Mongolian organization, the filiation group (sometimes the clan but mainly the smaller lineage) stands as a reference. The filiation group is defined in relation to its dead members whom are still present through the environmental space. In this context valorizing patrilineality, one should distinguish the larger clan-based political unity from the smaller lineage- based territorial unity, more related to economic relationships of cooperation. The latter unity is built up out of domestic groups, "the home hearth" (ail). The groupings of those domestic unities create a "group of tents" (xot ail) equivalent to several generations of patrilineal lineage. The term xot is sometimes highlighted with its meaning of both "town" and "parents-in-law." In the Uighur script, those meanings are expressed by the same writing quda/qota. Of course, the current dictionaries of modern Mongolian language distinguish these words, separating xot etxud which in the Uighur script are exactly the same. Even when the unity to which one belongs seems related to the patrilineal group, the structure of the territorial unity, man-located, seems to rely upon several generations of patrilineal lineage and hence upon political and economical games of alliance and marriages. Structural hesitations between direct and indirect forms of marriage exchange seem to allow a proper clan to increase its matrimonial partners and to structure its subordinate lineages.</page><page sequence="18">60 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) III. A. 2. The Linguistic Actualization. In the riddles, we have distinguished first a horizontal division of the body into two different parts. These two horizontally divided parts were related to a view-point of cognatic filiation, for one of those riddles, and to an agnatic filiation view-point for the two other ones. In another example, the body is divided into two vertical identical sides. The references to a classificatory collateral relation and to the law of primogeniture seemed to partake of the same type of view-point on filiation but in this context also partake of the tensions between the older and younger branches. In Mongolian law, the livestock and the usufruct of pasture lands was handed down to the youngest son, the holder of the home hearth. In the riddles related to human limbs, fingers and toes, the flowing of references to collaterally-related people and to ascendants could, moreover, evoke a division between indirect and deferred marriage exchange systems. The microcosmic patterns of the human body reflect back to representations of filiation and exchange, and thus partake in their alterations and political manipulations. When the body appears with several meanings in linguistic uses, its ethnographic study has to take into account these different levels. The ethno- linguistic data should be brought face-to-face with ethnographic data compiled during field-work. Instead of suppressing oppositions between the data sets, one has to look deeper in order to identify changes, their logic and their place in the Mongolian conceptions of the body. The human body's relationship to animals and landscape seems to join the aspects of both localization and consummation. The body concretely appears both as a real pattern and as unique part of life. Mountains and rivers, used to define pasture lands, seem to be favorite patterns of corporeal modeling. So, the landscape appears as a field used by human beings and their livestock, and also as a stock of categories used in corporeal references. III. A. 3. From Men to Animals. The terminologies used to define the fragmented body are similar for the living man and for animals, except the ones related to limbs. They are also used to denote the flesh and the meat. For example, the term "thigh" refers to the thigh in both humans and animals, that is, both the "thigh" and the "leg of lamb." Except for the limbs which distinguish men and animals, the names given to bones and flesh are similar for every living being. A study of the representations</page><page sequence="19">LAC aze 6i of bones related to the skeleton should be interesting, as it would identify some peculiar uses of bones, for example the hip bone and the scapula. The hip bone would be related to manly heroic patterns and the scapula to the inauspicious bad spirits. According to ethnographic data, some bones are emphasized by corresponding human practices but also by the representations men have of the same parts of their proper body. In this article, however, this kind of research will not be pursued. III. B. The Body, the Soul, and the Person. The frame of the "body" put in light of the Mongolian language denotes a living, concrete, completed, and sound body. It is in itself one of the two pieces constituting the "person." It is a physical medium of the human soul during its life. Because of this life-giving medium, the body keeps the marks of the soul fitted into and nourished in it. III. B. 1. The "Body" as a Locution Meaning the "Person." Several locutions denote the body as a stock of vital energy, a consumable and edible stock of living strength. For example, "to graze on one's body" (biye otorlox) scornfully denotes the state of being without activity, and desiring to rest more than necessary (Akim 1982: 33). Movement and activity are thus found as the manifestation of the living body. Nevertheless, it is mainly the living representation of the soul. Like the soul, the body is a component of the person. As a result one cannot follow the concept of person given to M. Mauss. According to him, the concept of "person," from the Latin persona , reflects with the ritual mask of ancestors and, by the way, with the dramatic role. It is a figure of the individual role in front of real or symbolic spectators. The term of "person" refers to personal identity and mostly to its role and social status. So, this concept expands upon three levels: moral, religious or juridical. In psychology, it takes the sense of "ego." The concept of persona also refers to the soul as a moving symbolic entity which may go out of the body (Mauss 1989 [1950]). Furthermore, the concept of the person is especially related to the soul because of the soul's special meaning of "dead spirits." The Mongolian concept of "person," however, puts together both the entity of the "soul," Latin persona , and "body," which signifies the medium of the soul and the location of its vital energy. So the "person" depends upon the existence both of the soul and of its double, the "body." The presence of both</page><page sequence="20">62 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) of these components in the person is allowed by the nourishing qualities of vital energy flowing in the body. The relations between one's body frame and its personal moral qualities are often noticed in Mongolian oral literature. The métonymie correspondence between the corporeal medium and a person's expression are often highlighted in the proverbs. For example, "It is better to decorate oneself with knowledge than to decorate one's body with things " ( Edeer biyee čimsnees / Erdmeer biyee äm' Gaadamba and Cerensodnom 1978:19). According to D. Le Breton, the face of the people appears most often as the true representation of the person (Le Breton 1992). Among Mongols, the face is the expression of this symbolical entity itself. To designate himself, a Mongol puts his finger on his nose. Concurrently, a currently-used proverb throws light on this aspect by denoting the moral qualities of one's facial lines. So, one is said to recognize "a good horse by his ears/a good man by his eyes" ( sain morī eixendee/sain er nüdendee ; Dašdorj and Rinčensambuu 1964: 60, §8497). Finally, the body appears as the double of the symbolic component of the person, the soul. The techniques related to the body intend to mark it with the marks of its symbolic double, the soul. It takes over the marks of the soul's life. The physical body, the soul and the vital energy are the three basic components of the "person" because of the fact that individual personality appears by and through those media. Living body and soul are related to each other. The expression of the concept of the "individual" takes shape in this context. In fact, the singular or the plural form of the first personal pronoun, bi or bid in modern Mongolian, is most often expressed through the derived reflexive or personal locution built from "body," meaning "my body," "my person," "myself' {biyee). The concept of the "person" in Mongolian partakes of an actualization of the soul with the living body as a medium. In anatomical and medical representations which are rationalized conceptions of the body, several different view-points cohabit. This fact appears in the Mongolian concept biye which includes several referential systems of representation related to health: the "living body" (amidv beve' the "physical health" (biye lags in), and the "organic body" (biye maxbod or biye bodis). While the first term underlines the body's vital energy, the second seems to refer to a Sino-Tibetan pattern, while the third term is specialized in a more mechanistic or biomedical system.</page><page sequence="21">LACAZE 63 III. B. 2. Under the Influence of Tantric Representations. Tantrism, related to the Tibetan-rite Buddhist cultural system, has had an important effect on the symbolic conceptions of the body. The reinstatement in a new body of dead souls seems related to representations of the body's death, once the vital energy has gone. These conceptions of reincarnation also fit in another ideological system: shamanism. In clan-patriarchal pastoral representations, on one hand, the vital energy takes part in a system of recycling while, on the other hand, the soul is introduced into a cycle of reincarnation in which it is reincarnated in its own lineage. These parameters also seem to inherit from Lamaism certain components related to ideas of reincarnation, particularly the idea of realization of one's own karma. Buddhist influences on the body should be visible in the fact that, in this ideology, the corporeal microcosm does not appear as a living or moving medium, by contrast to how it is defined in the representations of pastoral shamanism. In fact, according to R.A. Stein, in these Sino-Tibetan representations, the corporeal microcosm appears as a referential system formed into a vertical and self-based hierarchy (Stein 1 987). In this hierarchical system, the favorite frameworks, symbolized most typically by the representation of Mt. Sumeru, are vertical. In the Mongolian referential context discussed above, some "Buddhicized " frameworks seem to have been already incorporated. In another context, the concept of "person" and "individual" appear in Buddhism through the meanings pointed out by atman (Dandaron 1968). The human being's state is only a stage into the cycle of reincarnation leading to Nirvana. In Tantric Buddhism, this ineffable concept of "myself ' is both the fact and its cause. The individual is constituted by five components, five basic characters or dispositions, which may be translated as frame, strength, sensations, changeableness, conscience. One of the most important characteristic of the "individual" resides in its shape, a shape taken from his cycle of reincarnation. Each individual has the five senses of knowledge, that is, the five basic senses. The free will of the individual possessing these five means of cognition and recognition (analytical, instinctive and emotional) is the most significant component of this notion of "person." He thus possesses an objective conscience and a subjective one. The combinations of the two levels of conscience determine the free will and personal karma of the individual. Buddhism insists more on a "no-me" logic than on a "myself' logic. Nevertheless, "me" and "no-</page><page sequence="22">64 Mongolian Studies XXIII (2000) me" are realized completely through the cycle of reincarnation. In Buddhism, the individual is a conscious realization of the personal well-defined karma formed out of personal free will. Both ideas of self - resolution of "myself' and over- resolution of "no-me" - can be found in Buddhism. One cannot consider the "individual" as separate from his karma and from the cycle in which he participates. So, in during its time of life, the soul acquires peculiar qualities which marks the body it has come to inhabit. This is the "fixation process" of the soul into the body which occurs during the socialization of children and is reenacted at each crossing of a new social stage. IV. Conclusion. The human body is defined as a living medium which has to be socialized and, by that very process, humanized. At first, the ethno-linguistic analysis of the term biye "body" in Mongolian languages, defined it as a totality valorized in its completion. The body is actualized as a full or fragmented pattern, set in space. But, it is also an individual medium allowing the expression of the social person. In its denial or absence, it is used to name the spirits of the supernatural world, designated as "bodyless." Next, the study of pieces of oral literature such as proverbs or riddles linked to the "concept of the body" allowed us to define the body as a natural component introduced in a cycle of renewal. In this context, the body partakes of several kinship relationships where identified gaps between agnation (patrilineality) and cognation (matrilineality) are performed within segmentary social organizations as patterns of nomadic pastoralism. The categories cast on the body appear zoomorphic and sometimes anthropomorphic and are then largely used to express political organization. The body was seen to be in relation to, and participating in, the external universe. The corporeal harmony in the macrocosm corresponds to the harmony of its internal components. The body is in the same way a medium which represents the person and the stock of vital energy where the soul is alive and eats the strength of life. The stock of vital energy, the body and the soul are the three entities that compose the person in Mongolian languages. Foreign influences cast on the traditional representations of the body underline a problematic of the body understood as a medium in which patterns of several ideological systems were superimposed. Some components of the body frame allowed us to denote the present reconstruction related to different concepts of the body in Mongolian languages. Those components constitute a</page><page sequence="23">LACAZE 65 system of representations related not only to one but to several meanings of the "body," with several ways to refer to the body. They are connected with traditional representations of the macrocosm understood as a pastoral territory of nomadization, and with the changes brought along subsequently. In the symbolic representations upon which ethno-linguistic analysis has shed light, in which domestic animals seem complementary with the human body, and in which wild animals corresponding to this first relationship, the conceptions of the universe and of landscape rely on this organized structure in the system of land occupation and animal consummation. This system calls attention to pastoral shamanism where the breeding livestock is considered as a personal belonging and a thing self-production of the necessary means of subsistence. The patterns of domestic animals thus allow the expression of self- representations. In this context, foreign influences related to Tantric Buddhism and Soviet atheism reveal changes of the conception of the personal entity. The recent revival of spirituality among Mongolians may allow one to question the new means of expressing the person in order to highlight the successful syncretism between shamanism and Buddhism. In the people' s relationships to landscape, one must also wonder about the results of the transformations due to Soviet-influenced political changes in the traditional occupation of the land. In this context, one could speculate about the results of the fall of communism and of the disorganization of cooperating farms. This may allow speculation about the present process production of identity at ethnic and national levels, ones but also, at social and individual ones. For example, what is the meaning of the "horseman" frame for urban people who do not know how to ride horses? Thus the question of the symbolic Mongolian representations related to the body reveals how the complexity of the plurality of several referential patterns throws light on the explosion of traditional structures BIBLIOGRAPHY Akim, G., 1982.
