<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aristote et l'id6alisme platonicien. By CHARLES WERNER. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1910. Pp. xii + 370. This is an excellent piece of philosophical analysis. Dr. Werner knows the text of his author, and is acquainted with the recent French and German literature of the subject. In a series of chapters with such titles as " Being qua Being," " Form and Matter," " Essence," " Nature and Chance," "The Soul and the Body," " Thought," " Desire," " Virtue," " Pleasure," " The Prime Mover," he gives a compact and closely reasoned account of the metaphysical side of the Aristotelian philosophy. His method is perhaps too abstract and systematic to do justice to the individual Aristotle, the man, the teacher, the writer. He has nothing to say of the Politics, the Poetics, the scientific writings, and the detail of the Ethics and Logic. As his title implies, he holds that Aristotle, despite his destructive criticism of Plato, remains essentially a Platonist. Idealism is an equivocal and unfortunate word to express this Platonic philosophy, for in the one definite and scientific use of the term Plato- nism is not idealism at all. Dr. Werner believes with Zeller that there is a fundamental contradiction at the center of the Aristotelian system, but thinks Zeller has stated the contradiction wrongly. He perhaps ex- aggerates the difference. The precise definition and location of the contradiction involved in any and every absolute system of metaphysics is largely a matter of opinion or order of exposition. The chief novelty of Dr. Werner's book is his affirmation that Aristotle's God is identical with the soul of the world. A natural movement, he argues somewhat sophistically (p. 324), is a movement communicated by an internal prin- ciple; and since God produces the natural movement of the heavens, God is an internal principle of motion. But this is to confound the desire of the lover with the attractive power of the beloved. Aristotle explicitly says KWVEZ US EpoEVOV. The parodox is attenuated, however, by the subsequent statement that God is also the ideal world of Plato, and the sum total of the ideas. The fact is, we are dealing with notions too vague and equivocal for precise determination. The idea of God, except in its most naive and anthropomorphic form, is always developing toward pantheism. A pantheistic god is virtually identical with the soul of the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 397 world. But Aristotle himself would have repudiated the identification of God with the world-soul of the Timaeus, and later Aristotelians would have insisted on distinguishing their god from the immanent spirit of the Stoics.
