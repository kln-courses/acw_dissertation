This work is in some measure an expanded version of the author's Syngeneia: la parente' de l'homme avec Dieu d'Homrnre d la patristique, published in 1964 and noticed in JHS LXXXV (1965). Like its predecessor it is presented thesis fashion, each topic being dealt with under a separate heading, for there are no chapters in the ordinary sense of the word. Only a reviewer would be presumably expected to read the book straight through, for there is remarkably little dis- cussion or controversy. Des P. is content, for the most part, to quote views which happen to coincide with his own or which he regards as canonical. Chapter and verse are de rigueur and the range of learning displayed is impressive. Little of relevance or importance appears to have escaped the author's notice, whether in the spheres of religion, archaeology, literature or philosophy, though there is naturally some bias on the French side. The inevitable comparison with Nilsson's Geschichte der griechischen Religion reveals at once a profound difference in approach and attitude. Nilsson was a rationalist, constitutionally unwilling to discover any affinities between Greek religion and Christianity. Des P. is a Catholic, profoundly concerned with the syngeneia between God and Man, which although it does not become overt until the Stoics yet harks back to Homer. Again, both are compilations. But whereas Nilsson's great work is expansive and exhaus- tive, Des P is succinct to the point of brevity, yet, paradoxically, often repetitive to a needless degree. Though sound on archaeological and epigraphical evidence Des P., like Wilamowitz, tends to ignore that of the Minoan-Myceanaean on which so much of Nilsson's work was based. For the matter. The work opens with the defini- tion 'Une religion sans dogme, sans credo et t peu prbs sans pretres, qui se r'duit &amp; un ensemble de cultes fondus sur des mythes plus ou moins vraisemblables'. Few would disagree, though the precise relationship between myth and cult is hard to determine, as G. S. Kirk has recently and so ably demonstrated (Myth 1970). The first section deals with the gods individually. Zeus is seen, for the most part, through the eyes of A. B. Cook and some statements are uncritical, e.g. we are told that Hera supplanted Rhea on Cook's authority and that Smintheus (pace Nilsson) implies totemism. The section ends with a list of divine epithets, including, unexpectedly, quotations from the Oneirocriticon. The list of festivals is comprehensive but laconic. There is, e.g., no reference to the alternative reading 0'pase Kdpe; in connexion with the Anthesteria, though we are reminded that the qpappuaKog of the Thargelia has a parallel in Leviticus. There is a sound appraisal of the Greek attitude to the dead, but some may be shocked to learn that the beliefs of Eskimo hunters in 'la parente de l'homme et de l'animal' are reflected in the details of Olympian sacrifice. The importance of prayer as evidence for religious atti- tudes and beliefs is emphasised throughout and there is a comprehensive collection of liturgical remains. The second part deals with religious thought in Greece. Des P. declines to accept the view of many modern authorities that the Iliad is a secular poem, holding that underlying anthropomorphism is a sense of parentd with God. He finds evidence for this alliance in the prayers in Homer and the frequent appeals to anonymous powers. The lyric poets (Pindar admittedly had no inkling of personal immortality) and pre-Socratics (ignored in the Syngeneia) are followed by a cautious account of 'la vie Orphique', and of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which the author believes played their part in 'la prepara- tion 6vangdlique'. The monotheism of Aeschylus, the humanity of Sophocles and the sophistry of Euripides are most prominent again in the prayers. Aristo- phanes, on the other hand, though he reveals little of his personal religion, is a valuable source for the pop- ular beliefs of his age. Des P. analyses the miracles of Epidaurus with an eye towards Lourdes. Genuine miracles could, in his view, have occurred there 'comme, maintenant encore, 1k oiI l'Evangile n'a pas et6 annonce'. Socrates' daimon recalls the unknown god of the Areopagus, while Plato 'a le sens de la pribre'. Des P. has made a special study of Plato and displays, in particular, a close acquaintance with the Laws. As for the Stoics, 'S'il n'y a pas eu d'influence directe du christianisme sur Epictete indirectement la religion de J~sus a pu agir sur lui'. (SouilhC). There are interesting sections on astrology, magic and the Greek conception of sin. Neoplatonism is summarised in masterly fashion and Ricoeur's view recorded that the myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus by the Titans does not antedate this school. Part II concludes with a further examination of religious ecstasy, divination, shamanism, monotheism,</page><page sequence="2">172 NOTICES OF BOOKS divinisation and other subjects, which have already been touched on, in preparation for the grand finale. In reading the third part the reviewer was con- stantly reminded of the whimsical observation of a famous British scholar that St Paul wasn't evidence for anything. That Des P. has succeeded in showing that he was is at once a tribute to his faith and his learning. A vocabulary of religious terms is included in an appendix. This is a remarkable book, which perhaps only a Jesuit could have written. The more secular-minded will doubtless prefer to ignore the specious theological deductions, but most will find Des P. an accurate and useful compendium. JOHN POLLARD University College of N.
