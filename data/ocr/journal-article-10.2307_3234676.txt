<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nationalizing the Third- World State: Categorical Imperative or Mission Impossible? Crawford Young University of Wisconsin-Madison Statesmen in the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa and many scholars who studied their politics assigned high priority to the task of "nation-building." They also believed that as "national consciousness" developed, communal solidarities, considered retrogressive, would yield to the forces of national integration. But this has not happened. As Professor Young points out, the processes of economic and social change everywhere are likely to intensify solidarities based on cultural pluralism. It appears that in many instances the fellow feeling of nationhood is more likely to come through the civil and effective performance of governmental functions, especially services, than from an overtly vigorous pursuit of national integration. Crawford Young is Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He has served as visiting professor in Uganda, and as Dean of the Social Science Faculty at the former National University of Zaire from 1973 to 1975. He is author of Politics in the Congo (1965), The Politics of Cultural Pluralism (1976), and Ideology and Development in Africa (1982). He is co-author of Issues of Political Development (1967), and Cooperatives and Development (1981). The Politics of Cultural Pluralism won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association (1977) and shared the Ethnic and Cultural Pluralism Award of the American Political Science Association (1979). "Nation-building," long seen as a compelling mandate of statecraft in the third world, has lately lost some of its allure. Two short decades ago, the concept commanded general and unquestioned assent. The construc- tion of the nation was an inspirational summons for new states; even as staid an observer as Carl Friedrich portrayed it as categorical impera-</page><page sequence="2">162 Nationalizing the Third-World State tive: "Such is the dialectic of the political that the state seeks and must seek to foster the growth of a nation, indeed must posit its potential coming into being." 1 The modernization literature of the day accords top priority to this objective; a state had to resolve its "identity crisis" in order to cross the threshold of progress.2 National integration was indispensable to the efficient functioning of the modem state; repre- sentative are the words of Howard Wriggins: In traditional society... it is more normal for... cleavages to be deepened because so many sides of one's life and self are encom- passed by a single group, while so many other individuals are excluded. Regional, ethnic, and religious differences and contrasts in ways of life confirm each other.... Where such marked differ- ences and distrust exist, it is difficult for a sense of fellow feeling to emerge. Yet, fellow feeling is the basis of a sound state. If that necessary fellow feeling is to develop, many of these differences will have to be diminished.3 The task was not only urgent but grandiose. The classical definitions of nation and nationality, which informed the perspectives of statesman and academician alike, were exceedingly broad. Rupert Emerson saw the nation as "a community of people who feel that they belong together," because they share a common heritage and a common destiny.4 Hans Kohn attributed a comprehensive moral charter to the nation: Nationalism is a political creed that underlies the cohesion of moder societies, and legitimizes their claim to authority. National- ism centers the supreme loyalty of the overwhelming majority of the people upon the nation-state, either existing or desired. The nation- state is regarded not only as the ideal, natural, or normal form of political organization but also as the indispensable framework for all social, cultural, and economic activities.5 1.

The Imperative of Nation-Building Thus the new states of the postwar era in Asia and Africa inherited an ambitious charge. Independence and affirmation of the sovereignty of the state did not suffice. Realization of nationhood was thought to be indispensable to the state's consolidation. The finite energies of the state would be dissipated in fissiparous conflict unless the transcendent loyal- ties of the citizenry could be firmly tied to a national ideal. Unless the nation were an unchallengeable vision, eclipsing all lesser communal at- tachments, aspirations for development would vanish in an impenetrable tangle of mutual suspicions and parochial conflict. Not only was the necessity of the nation accepted, at least by the leadership, so also was the possibility of its attainment. Few went so far as Sekou Tour6 of Guinea, who at the time of independence declared: "In three of four years, no one will remember the tribal, ethnic or reli- gious rivalries which, in the recent past, caused so much damage to our country and its population." 6 But many believed that the sentiments of unity attained in the anticolonial struggle could be transformed into a securely rooted national orientation. The presumed experience of the first and second worlds was taken as an exemplary model. At this time, the "melting pot" metaphor was still widely held for the United States. It seemed that the West European nation-states had assimilated or neu- tralized peripheral ethnic consciousness, and Soviet nationality policy had transformed the "prison of peoples" into a socialist commonwealth with nationality differences safely relegated to harmless cultural spheres. The modernizing third-world state had only to adapt well-honed policies borrowed from first- and second-world experience to become in its turn nation as well as state, over a generation or two. The vision of the nation triumphant, within the grasp of the new state, coincided with a broader confidence in the march of progress, in human capacities to master the material environment and manage societal trans- formation. The remarkable pace of scientific advance seemed to open new vistas of material well-being. Keynesian economic theory promised the state policy tools to manage sustained economic expansion without depressions. The welfare state appeared to diffuse the blessings of abun- dance to all strata of the citizenry. If progress were paradigm, then all good things might be expected to go together. Time and proficient state- craft would suffice to bring to the third world the fruits of progress 6.

Included in mankind's birthright was national integration.7 II. New Uncertainties of National Integration The mood of the 1980's is far more sober, if not downright somber. Both state-socialist and advanced-capitalist economies face a difficult decade. Faith in technological advance is diluted by a growing conviction that new knowledge generates problems as fast as it uncovers answers. A consciousness of limits supplants the belief in boundless resource potential. For third-world states, especially in Africa, absent an oil bonanza, and excepting the handful of Mexicos, Hong Kongs, Taiwans, and Singapores, the grip of poverty seems more relentless than ever. A new sense of uncertainty concerning "national integration" forms part of the broader pattern. Examined through the prism of the eighties, the older securities as to the direction of historical change dissolve. The "melting pot" metaphor in America has all but disappeared; skepticism of its usefulness and credibility, which appeared like perverse iconoclasm two decades ago when Glazer and Moynihan first voiced it,8 has become conventional wisdom. The United Kingdom, once the very model of the modern polity, watches Irish nationalists starve themselves to death and finds itself castigated as a perpetrator of "internal colonialism." 9 Ethonationalism on the continent, formerly viewed as a quaint creed espoused by eccentrics, royalists, and reactionaries, resurfaces as revo- lutionary doctrine.10 The Soviet Union faces relentless increase in the non-Slavic Central Asian and Caucasus populations and the evident persistence of ethnic solidarities partly fostered by its own nationality policy.11 Thus vanishes the illusion that national integration is an his- torically-ordained destiny. In the third world itself, a succession of lethal crises amply demon- strated the explosive force of politicized ethnic, religious, or racial cleavage: the Bangladesh secession; the interminable crises in Lebanon and Chad; the revolt of the ethnic periphery in Burma, Iran, and 7.

Communal conflict constitutes a large enough fraction of the political crises threatening to engulf the state to eliminate the facile optimism of the sixties. III. Rethinking National Integration The question then arises, is the pathway to nation-building simply longer and more tortuous than was initially supposed, or is it perhaps a cul-de- sac? Is the viability of the state in all cases dependent on investing this impersonal abstraction with the vibrant, nurturant, anthropomorphic properties of the nation? 12 And, is such a transformation always pos- sible? Must the third-world state be nationalized? Or does the pursuit of a perhaps impossible dream carry costs which may subvert rather than preserve the state? As one pursues these questions, five arguments need to be developed. 1) There can be no doubt that the fellow-feeling to which Wrig- gins refers is important to the harmonious functioning of a polity, but it cannot be achieved by the simple imposition of a national ideal through exhortation or incantation. 2) The assumption that historical process tends inexorably to erode cultural pluralism in favor of national identity is false; on the contrary, modernization processes are likely to intensify communal consciousness, a fact which must be incorporated into any realistic strategy of promoting fellow-feeling among citizens. 3) The persistence or even strengthening of cultural pluralism is not necessarily incompatible with the simultaneous strengthening of national awareness; whereas subnational cleavage need not be celebrated or encouraged, it is dangerous to respond to cultural pluralism with repressive policies. 4) The cultural content of the national idea merits more careful attention; appropriate strategies depend on the communal connota- tions emanating from the state, the nature of cultural pluralism within the polity, and the interlinkage between nation-state and cultural pluralism. 5) In many circumstances, state-building deserves priority over nation-building; the competence, probity, effectiveness, fairness, representativeness, and distributive justice of the state in its conduct 12. This point is developed by Malcolm Byrne, "The Ideas of the Nation in Re- cent Political Thought: A Reassessment," paper read at Louisiana Political Science Association, Baton Rouge, 1977.</page><page sequence="6">166 Nationalizing the Third-World State of public affairs will usually be more decisive in creating fellow- feeling than any heavy-handed insistence on national loyalty. IV. The Third-World State and Nationalism The contemporary state system in Asia, Africa, and the Americas is largely a product of Western imperialism. The territorial grid reflects the spatial partition resulting from colonial rivalries, the internal sub- divisions devised by colonizers for administrative convenience, or sub- sidiary processes triggered by European intrusion (much of the Middle Eastern state system). A small number of historical states (China, Japan, Thailand, Iran, Ethiopia) managed to elude conquest, partly through a defensive adaptation of elements of the Western ideology and organizational forms. At times colonial overrule was superposed upon the territorial frame of an historical state, which partially retained its identity (Vietnam, Cambodia, Egypt, Morocco, Swaziland). But for the most part the territorial frame of the state resulted from colonial manu- facture. Most precolonial states, particularly those of any scale, were not culturally homogeneous, except perhaps for the ruling class. The ob- servation of Elizabeth Colson that "political and ethnic boundaries rarely coincided in precolonial Africa" 13 is also valid for other parts of the third world. The cultural diversity of their new subjects was of little concern to the colonial rulers. Indigenous peoples were all "natives," and that appellation conveyed all the cultural information the colonizers needed. The essence of the colonial state was its alien character and its voca- tion of domination.14 Although it could not operate without local inter- mediaries, its upper reaches and bureaucratic core were alien, staffed as they were by personnel drawn from the home country. A colonial state, by definition, ruled over subjects, not citizens. The ruler-subject chasm coincided with a racial divide, thus making this cleavage the most immediately conspicuous, and in most instances overshadowing other forms of cultural pluralism. One crucial concept associated with the state, which had become general in Europe by the nineteenth century, was the notion of nation- 13.

One of the first contributions to stress the mission of domination as a de- fining facet of the colonial state was Hamza Alavi, "The State in Post-Colonial Societies: Pakistan and Bangladesh," New Left Review 23 (July-August 1972): 59-81.</page><page sequence="7">Crawford Young 167 ality. Although some colonial powers claimed that their overseas pos- sessions were extensions of the metropolitan domain, and thus invested with the national personality of the metropole (France, Portugal, United States in Hawaii and Puerto Rico), such projections were not usually taken seriously in either the metropole or the colony. Third-world nationalism received its central impulse from anticolonialism. After originating in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as affec- tive attachment to existing states, nationalism in the nineteenth century became the battle cry of communities, founded on common language and culture, asserting their right to constitute sovereign states. From these movements came the crucial doctrine of self-determination, which provided the bridge between European ethnolinguistic nationalism and third-world, anticolonial nationalism. The doctrine gained partial inter- national acceptance after World War I at Versailles, although the peace negotiators had no intention of extending its application beyond Europe. The idea, however, was abroad and quickly became a potent weapon in the gathering challenge to imperial rule.15 Nationalism as an ideology of liberation inverted the logic of nine- teenth-century ethnolinguistic movements in Europe. The latter began with the assertion of "we" and deduced political entitlements from it. Anticolonial nationalism began with "they"-the illegitimate relevant other whose alien hegemony was rejected. The task of nationalism was to create the "we," yet the only practical focus was the territorial unit of colonial administration, however lacking it might be in historical or cultural sanction. In the early stages, the focus was frequently uncertain; one may recollect the interterritorial activity of the great Latin American liberator Simon Bolivar, or the continental rather than more specific territorial thrust of early African nationalism.16 Even where ample historical material was available for rendering legitimate a territorial 15.

The "we" brought into being by way of antithesis to the alien, hegemonical "they" required new moral content. The states of Europe considered models of modernity were nation-states. Anticolonial nationalism must therefore be redefined as the diffusion of transcendant affective ties to the decolonized states. But anticolonial nationalists would soon discover the problematic as- pects of national identity. Frequently, the political competition which colonizers permitted in the terminal colonial era mobilized cultural cleavages which had been overshadowed by the racial division of the "colonial situation." 18 In the aftermath of independence, new com- munal claims rose to the surface. Nehru spoke for an epoch in expressing his dismay at the force of linguistic claims: "The work of sixty years of the Indian National Congress was standing before us, face to face with centuries-old India of narrow loyalties, petty jealousies, and ignorant prejudices engaged in mortal conflict, and we were simply horrified to see how thin was the ice upon which we are skating." 19 All of these factors demonstrate the formidable logic of the nation- building ideal. The colonial subject became a citizen of the anti-colonial nationalist movement; his or her civic attachment had now to be trans- ferred to the newly emerging state. The irredeemably alien nature of the colonial state had to be purged. The fragmenting and conflict-laden potential of underlying cultural pluralism had to be overcome. If citizens could be induced to perceive their state as nation, with all that connoted by way of civic attachments, a stable and harmonious polity might be achieved. Nation-building then had to be a pre-eminent aim of statecraft. V. Persistence of Cultural Pluralism Cultural pluralism, however, would not so easily be tamed. Even now, two or three decades after the surge to independence, the saliency of ethnic, religious, and racial cleavages has clearly not diminished. If any 17.

Why should this be so? Although a comprehensive explanation might enumerate dozens of contributing factors, I will suggest only five. At the top of the list I would place a misreading of the historical relationship between mod- ernization and cultural consciousness. National loyalties were supposed to be progressive; solidarities of ethnicity, religion, or race were back- ward. As history assured progress, the lesser attachments of ethnicity would slowly give way before the higher forms of community embodied in the nation. The very vocabulary of analysis was redolent of this linear determinism. Ethnic or linguistic attachments, as in Nehru's ob- servation cited above, were "narrow loyalties," ignorant prejudices," and "centuries-old" parochialism, joined in mortal combat with sixty years of dedication to the national ideal. In Africa, newly mobilized and con- scious ethnic collectivities numbering millions of persons were dis- paraged as "tribes," and ethnic solidarity was pejoratively termed "tribalism." Yet a closer study of the linguistic and culturally based nationalities of Europe would have shown these assumptions to be false. The spread of literacy; the growth of cities and the higher degree of social con- sciousness usually encountered in the urban environment; the inten- sification of networks of social communications drawing rural folk into a sense of membership in larger collectivities: in Europe all these pro- cesses were attended by heightened ethnonational consciousness, which required only the catalyst of politicization.20 Modernization in the third world has produced parallel trajectories of consciousness and solidarity.21 Although the solidarities of cultural pluralism were not necessarily antithetical to the extension of some enhanced measure of national 20. Such classics as Kohn, The Idea of Nationalism, and Deutsch, Nationalism and Social Communication, all concord on this point. See also Hugh Seton-Wetson, Nations and States (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1977). 21. This argument is developed in much greater detail in Crawford Young, The Politics of Cultural Pluralism (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1976). The literature on this theme is now vast and persuasive. For particularly cogent statements, see Robert Melson and Howard Wolpe, eds., Nigeria: Modernization and the Politics of Communalism (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1976); Abner Cohen, ed., Urban Ethnicity (London: Tavistock Publications, 1974). The literature on various dimensions of cultural cleavage in India is espe- cially rich; see inter alia, Paul R. Brass, Language, Religion, and Politics in North India (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974); Marguerite R. Barnett, The Politics of Cultural Nationalism in South India (Princeton: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1976).</page><page sequence="10">170 Nationalizing the Third-World State commitment, historical sociology provided no warrant for the assump- tion that time labored to erode subnational loyalties. Second, the succession to state power of the nationalist leadership at once raised a series of issues colloquially described, in a widespread African metaphor, as "slicing the national cake." The allocation of societal resources took on new social meanings. Patterns of distribution among cultural groups became much more visible, and ethnic score- cards were quickly drawn up. Public employment; access to the agen- cies of social mobility, especially schools; distribution of such coveted amenities as dispensaries, roads, and piped water; siting of major de- velopment projects: all these state actions became subject to a calculus of relative advantage and disadvantage. Awareness of "differential mod- ernization" was a crucial aspect of the general increase in social and political consciousness created by anticolonial nationalism. The com- plexity and ultimate subjectivity of this calculus led diverse groups to believe simultaneously that they were deprived.22 The tensions generated by distributional issues were acerbated by the tendancy for constant re- calculation of benefits; "what have you done for us lately?" was the question posed to the state by self-conscious groups. The volatility of distributional issues was also heightened by the re- markable expansion in the scope of state action. Many states of both socialist and capitalist persuasion adopted economic planning and estab- lished large public sectors of economic undertakings. Newly mobilized and politicized cultural groups correctly perceived that choices made by the state were crucial to their relative and absolute social and economic well-being. To cite one extreme example, state expenditures in Zaire multiplied by a factor of fifteen from 1939 to 1950, then tripled again in the final colonial decade. By 1974, they had reached a peak of some 59 percent of the gross domestic product.23 Third, the introduction of open political competition, usually in the terminal colonial period, injected new patterns of institutionalized con- flict at a time when cutural cleavages were becoming mobilized. In Western states, electoral competition became a central aspect of the political process only gradually and initially involved a very limited 22. One may recollect in this respect the role played by Bengali economists in developing sophisticated documentation purporting to prove the inequitable dis- tribution of the fruits of Pakistani growth in the 1960s. At the same time, West Pakistanis were persuaded that a major sacrifice was being made to achieve regional balance. See Rounaq Jahan, Pakistan: Failure in National Integration (New York: Columbia University Press, 1972). 23.

The political parties which emerged to organize political com- petition progressively incorporated the diverse cleavages of class, reli- gion, region, and ethnicity. But the constitutional institutions were not asked to absorb these divisions all at once. Further, the apparent winner- take-all theory of democratic politics was actually circumscribed by the expectation of alternation of parties of power, and the major limita- tions on dramatic reversals of state action by the maze of interest groups, entrenched bureaucracies, and tacit understandings of the informal con- stitution. The abrupt introduction of Western constitutional forms, im- posed by withdrawing colonizers in accordance with a code of "with- drawal with honor," frequently created apocalyptic perceptions as to the stakes of particular elections. The entire political system was up for bid, with immense uncertainties as to the consequences of the outcome. When ethnic or religious appeals entered electoral competition, a cres- cendo of cultural politicization could rapidly ensue. The very theatrical qualities of any electoral campaign, in such circumstances, raised ten- sions several more notches. A train of mutual denunciation led to an ob- jectification of the opposition as a dangerously hostile force and focused escalating public emotions upon the ultimate drama of the balloting itself. Where cultural mobilization was extensive and cleavages deep, the model of democratic instability argued by Rabushka and Shepsle might be realized.24 Political parties increasingly reflect cultural pluralism and engage in a spiral of ferocious competition, finally decanting into il- legality and violence. The First Republic of Nigeria did follow such a sequence. Diverse authoritarian formulas were soon devised to contain the mobilized pluralism: single-party systems, military regimes, or some combination of the two. Only a small number of countries persisted with open electoral competition long enough for the process to become institutionalized and the fears of cataclysmic alterations to disappear. The two most important examples of institutionalization are India and Sri Lanka; although cultural pluralism flourishes in both countries, they do have in common a long familiarity with the electoral process extend- ing far back in the colonial period. Fourth, the postcolonial process posed in new ways the issue of domination. The state might fall into the hands of a particular cultural group, which would then proceed to make its privilege and hegemony permanent. South Africa is the extreme case of the cultural domination model; the state becomes the exclusive preserve of the hegemonical 24. Alvin Rabushka and Kenneth A. Shepsle, Politics in Plural Societies: A Theory of Democratic Instability (Columbus, Ohio: Charles E. Merrill, 1972).</page><page sequence="12">172 Nationalizing the Third-World State group, which progressively identifies its own preservation with perpetua- tion of its control.25 In such widely separated polities as Guyana, Bu- rundi, Sudan, and Iraq, the state became an agency for the cultural hegemony of a particular group. The psychosis of domination is well captured in one of the summit conferences on the eve of the Nigerian civil war: We all have our fears of one another. Some fear that opportu- nities in their own areas are limited and they would therefore wish to... venture unhampered in other parts. Some fear the sheer weight of numbers of other parts which they feel could be used to the detriment of their own interests. Some fear the sheer weight of skills and the aggressive drive of other groups which they feel has to be regulated if they are not to be left as the economic, social, and possible political, underdogs in their own areas of origin in the very near future. These fears may be real or imag- ined; they may be reasonable or petty. Whether they are genuine or not, they have to be taken account of because they influence to a considerable degree the actions of the groups towards one another and, more important perhaps, the daily actions of the individual in each group towards individuals from other groups.26 Fifth, and finally, cultural solidarities have the potential for intensely emotional articulation. Ethnic claims in the political arena are in part simply instrumental assertions of group interests.27 But as Bell has ob- served, ethnicity has a more potent mobilizing face than class "because it can combine an interest with an affective tie." 28 This affective tie plunges its roots deep into the human psyche, and is capable of arousing fears, anxieties, insecurities, and passions conducive to sudden explo- sions of violent behavior.29 25.

The immediate episode may pass quickly, but its residues persist; the shadow of 1969, for example, still lies over Malaysia. Politics is, in part, a school; the learning process over the past three decades has produced a more sophisticated awareness of the nature and dynamics of cultural pluralism. There is widespread recognition among both statesmen and observers of the plausibility of the first three prop- ositions I suggested earlier. Few would deny the value of fellow-feeling, but its elusiveness is now apparent. Winning passive acceptance of the existing state may not be excessively difficult, but investing it with moral content requires more than rhetorical invocation on ceremonial occa- sions. Above all, the new "nation" cannot be expected to eclipse and replace all other communal attachments; the deepening of cultural plu- ralism in many contexts is plain for all to see. Historical process is not inevitably handmaiden to national integration. If cultural pluralism is more likely to persist and intensify than to vanish, then nation-building can only proceed on the premise that nation is a concept to be reconciled with other patterns of divergence, not to replace them. VI. Varieties of Third-World Nation-States If that which I have outlined is the case, the relationship between nation and cultural pluralism is more complex than was earlier sup- posed. Here one needs to distinguish between nation-building contexts, on the basis of the relationship between the state and cultural pluralism. For purposes of this discussion, I would suggest a three-fold classifica- tion: (1) cultural stratification states; (2) cultural center-periphery states; and (3) multiethnic states without a specific cultural definition.30 Not all states will fit comfortably within this condensed taxonomy, nor are the categories internally homogeneous. Nevertheless, they may serve to organize our survey of the nation-building idea. In the first set of states, cultural differentiation overlaps social and economic stratification. Cultural segments are not predominantly asso- ciated with territoriality, but are found-in varying proportions- throughout the country. This is the characteristic pattern of most Latin 30. A more elaborate taxonomy is suggested in Young, Politics of Cultural Pluralism, pp. 92-97.</page><page sequence="14">174 Nationalizing the Third-World State American states, the Caribbean, and the Maghreb lands with significant Berber populations. These are the types of states which gave rise to the "cultural pluralism" theories of J. S. Furnivall and M. G. Smith.31 In Latin America, social and cultural hierarchies display a subtle inter- penetration of class and racial metaphors. The possibility for upward mobility both in socioeconomic status and cultural classification (the "cholofication" or "ladinization" process) softens the contours and reinforces the tacit legitimacy of these hierarchies.32 In the second group of polities, the state is associated with a core community, often in terms of historical origin. The dominant culture embedded in the mythology and symbolism of the state may be that of a minority, but the state includes in its geographic and social periphery a number of other communities. Examples of states in this category, with an his- torical personality antecedent to the colonial era, include Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Burma, Iran, and Ethiopia. In other instances, the political unit may be of colonial lineage, but nonetheless a core com- munity has marked the state with its cultural imprint-Iraq, for ex- ample, a number of other predominantly Arab states, and Malaysia. In the final category, the state remains distinct from the various cul- tural segments. Its identity is carefully separated from the multicultural base of society. It projects itself as culturally neutral or as a composite of its constitutive elements. In this instance, specificities of particular groups must be blurred so that possessive connotations are averted. Cultural neutrality does not exclude the possibility that one or a few groups may achieve a dominant position within the political institutions. But they would seek to conceal rather than celebrate their hegemony. Examples of such polities include most sub-Saharan African and an- glophonic Caribbean states, Indonesia, Philippines, and, at least ar- guably, India and Pakistan. The nation-building issue is posed quite differently in these three types of states. For cultural stratification states, national identity is usually not in dispute. Where the state is of long standing, as in the Latin American cases, and the intelligentsia drank deeply of nineteenth- century liberal nationalism of Europe, national sentiments are securely established and deeply rooted. While the Indian residual sector may be important in parts of Latin America, no one can doubt the intensity and 31. J. S.

Although no empirical measures are available, the argu- ment is at least plausible that these sentiments of nationality are as strongly held as those of the classical European nation-states which usually serve as point of reference in theories of nationalism. Indeed, it is intriguing that the major studies of nationalism make almost no ref- erence to the Latin American experience. In the Mahgreb, the Arab and Islamic core of the national cultures is not disputed (nor, sotto voce, is the French linguistic and cultural impact at the top layers of the socio- cultural hierarchies).33 The swiftly repressed 1980 student disorders in Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria), stimulated by demands for Berber cultural rights, remain to date an isolated event, though possibly portentous for the future. Even in South Africa, the gathering revolutionary challenge by Af- ricans does not dispute the sanctity of the territorial unit, but only the formalization of hierarchy and white privilege through a state ideology of racial stratification. Indeed, African opinion largely resists the re- gime's tinkering with the territorial state, through the imposition of ten ethnic "homelands" to be cut out of the South African territorial space as a means of denying citizenship to blacks. The demand is rather for a deterritorialization of race and ethnicity. The nation-building idea is likely to be most mischievous in center- periphery cultural polities. The historical association of the state with the core culture means that the nation is inevitably identified with the dom- inant group. The imperative of nation-building then means the imposi- tion of the core culture upon the periphery. Given the higher levels of cultural consciousness now generally prevalent, this type of national integration strategy is likely to provoke a hostile countermobilization of the periphery. Burma, Iran, and Ethiopia are exemplary cases of this process. Nation-building as a moral cloak for intensified domination is a dangerous doctrine. In the horizontally multicultural polity, nation-building-provided state neutrality is maintained-is less troublesome but still quite difficult. The state has long been recognized as a necessary unit and derives ad- ditional legitimacy from affective symbols created by anticolonial na- tionalism. The register of emotional resonance for such states is, at the outset, limited. Yet even in the historically brief period since decoloniza- tion, systematic efforts, through state control of such socializing instru- mentalities as the educational system and communication media, to val- 33.

The idea of Indonesia may be contested in former Portuguese Timor and feeble in West Irian,34 but in the central regions of Java and Sumatra it is undoubtedly much stronger today than it was four or five decades ago. Similarly, the con- cepts of Nigeria, Cameroon, or Kenya appear to be acquiring increasing affective meaning-not to replace ethnicity, but to function as another realm of solidarity.35 VII. Lessons of Experience In the last three decades, the nation-building imperative has been at its zenith-perhaps an historic peak, if our sense of new uncertainties and diminished conviction in this pathway is correct. Certainly it has had an impact, even if the result has not always been more secure national integration. What are some of the lessons of experience during the epoch? In many countries a state bourgeoisie has taken form with a strong commitment to the polity. While this class may well be divided by eth- nicity or religion, its social status and economic base are rooted in the state and its preservation. Perhaps independent of the state but likely to share the national commitment of the state bourgeoisie, are the in- digenous mercantile and capitalist classes, whose sphere of action is linked to the state's territorial space. From these groups probably come the most enthusiastic supporters of national integration. To the extent that strategies for overcoming multicultural cleavages are inspired by "consociationalism," these milieux supply the leadership and perform the "summit diplomacy" which manages tension between cultural seg- ments in the polity.36 Hyden takes the argument a step further in sug- gesting that consolidation of the state bourgeoisie is crucial not only 34.

In this respect, I would differ with Walker Connor and some other students of nationalism who urge restricting the concept of nation to those affective attach- ments firmly grounded in language and culture, as with the European movements whose claims first gave rise to the concept of nationalism; see "A Nation Is a Nation." Over time, I feel that the symbolic meanings associated with the idea of "Nigeria" or "Indonesia" are taking on many of the attributes of the idea of "nationality" in Europe, even though they will not supplant cultural pluralism. 36. The consociational model is primarily attributable to Arend Lijphart, De- mocracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration (New Haven: Yale Uni- versity Press, 1977); see also Eric A.

In the Latin American states, of pronounced Indian heritage, the deepening of the national concept to incorporate a larger portion of the social hierarchy symbolically fuses the myth of the Indian past with the Hispanic heritage. Perhaps this began earliest and went furthest in Mexico; Lafaye shows the early weaving together in Mexican national ideology of the Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe legends: the Hispaniciza- tion of a mythological Indian god-hero, and the indigenization of the Virgin Mary through her miraculous apparition to a humble Indian.38 In Peru, the populist Velasco military regime removed the portrait of Pizarro from the president's office, and promoted a cult around such symbols of Inca resistance as Tupac Amaru. Although racial and cultural fusion as national myth has indisputable force, there are also some recent signs that separate Indian and Afro- Latin solidarities may emerge in a more explicitly ethnic sense than has been the case historically. In the Amazon regions of Peru and Ecuador, extension of the national road network and communications systems into previously isolated Indian regions brings in its train an influx of primarily mestizo colonists. Conflicts over land and resource use emerge, and some Indian groups are reacting through ethnic mo- bilization.39 The hegemonic efforts of the previously isolated Atlantic coastal region have likewise provoked new forms of cultural mobilization by this Indian group.40 In Bolivia, similar patterns of Indian ethnic self-assertion have been reported. In Brazil, symptoms of rising racial consciousness are detected by some analysts.41 37.

In Malaysia, the communal riots in 1969 led to heavy promotion of a new national ideology, which called for reinforcement of the Malay lan- guage and culture as embodiment of nationality, accorded new symbolic deference to Islam as state religion, and stressed the importance of dif- fusing the national ideology through racially integrated schools.42 In Burundi, where a Hutu uprising in 1972 was crushed by the Tutsi ruling elite in a bloodbath claiming 100,000 to 200,000 lives, the Tutsi leader- ship put forth the argument that the conceptualization of ethnicity was an external fabrication. Colonial administrative policy and analytical paradigms imposed by external observers created the concept of a rigidly divided society with Tutsi overlords and Hutu clients. As a gov- ernment communique immediately after the massacres put it: "The ditch in question [between the ethnic groups] was dug by the coloniser. Very simply and from earliest youth. The whole school system was marked by segregation. The children had to tell 'the good fathers' [the Catholic missionaries] to which ethnic group they belonged-that as if they knew it, the poor kids." 43 In both cases, the national idea pro- posed, although reassuring to the politically dominant group (Malays and Tutsi), did not much appeal to the other cultural segments. The insensitive promotion of nation-building in forms that seemed a simple pretext for cultural domination was a frequent source of difficulty. Ethnic Burman leaders in the early years of independence saw Burman language, dress, and culture as a crucial agency for national integra- tion. What emerged instead was a permanent impasse between the Burman core and the Shan, Arakanese, Chin, Kachin, and Karen periphery. The Shan principalities, financed by narcotics trade, and Karen zones, have insulated themselves with de facto autonomy.44 In Pakistan, the effort to impose Urdu on the Bengali regions was an important episode on the road to rupture. Punjabi domination of the military and bureaucracy renders suspect enthusiastic talk of national integration, even after the Bangladesh separation. Baluchis have been 42.

In Iran, the "white revolution" of the Pahlavi regime included a nation-building component, clearly tied to Persian language and culture. Even Islam was devalued, through the symbolic stress on the pre-Islamic Persian empire. The repression of peripheral ethnicity by the Pahlavi state reinforced rather than eliminated it. The international arena exhibits significant rapport with nation-build- ing creeds. Because the international system is based upon sovereign states, there is-with some exceptions-an a priori hostility to cultural claims translated to the international arena, particularly if these call for fragmentation of states. This was particularly the case for Africa, where the integrity of existing states became a central tenet of an emer- gent code of African international jurisprudence. It is intriguing to note that most African separatist movements, even though they grow out of culturally derived tensions, nonetheless put forward colonial administra- tive regions as the territorial base for secession (Eritrea, Western Sahara, Biafra, Katanga).45 In sum, we can discern a trend towards reduction of the prominence accorded to self-conscious, nation-building strategies. This pattern is not universal; the national ideology campaign in Malaysia is an obvious exception, and a number of others could be cited. Nor does this neces- sarily portend disappearance of the "nation" idea in the public doctrine of the contemporary state. Rather it reflects a more sober assessment of the nature and complexity of cultural pluralism, and a greater sensitivity to the limits of short-term, nation-building strategies. In my fourth proposition, I argued above that the contextual varia- tion in the cultural basis and self-concept of the state is an important factor. In the cultural stratification states, the nationality concept faces little challenge, although the question of equality between social and cultural strata is crucial. The risks are particularly great in core-periph- ery cultural distributions, where stress on national integration is likely to reinforce anxieties and resentments in the periphery. In the large number of multicultural polities, without a culturally defined state, ex- perience suggests that affective ties to the state as nation may slowly increase, without diminution of cultural solidarities. The challenge to 45.

High-visibility nation-building policies may not be the most efficacious means to attain these ends. Indeed, the urgency of nation-building as crucial priority deserves to be questioned. Although politicized cultural pluralism provides a more enduring and serious challenge to statecraft than was commonly assumed to be the case two or three decades ago, it rarely threatens the ultimate existence of the state. The formal persistence of extant states, even in conditions of utter breakdown as in Lebanon and Chad, is quite remarkable. So is the rarity of actual fragmentation; in the last three decades, only Bangladesh broke away from a securely established exist- ing state. (This excepts such short-lived entities as the "Mali Federation" of Senegal and Mali, the "United Arab Republic" of Egypt and Syria, and the abortive union of Singapore and Malaysia.) In the overwhelm- ing majority of cases, the claims of cultural segments are for equity within an existing state, however difficult this may be to attain. My fifth proposition held that state-building may frequently be a more important task than nation-building. By this, I do not mean merely enhancing its centralized power and hegemony over society but improv- ing its effectiveness in meeting the expectations of the citizenry. This means effective provision of valued services to the rural periphery as well as the capital city (schools, health facilities, water, transporta- tion links to central places). These services need to be equitably avail- able in the different cultural zones of the country; the "national cake" must be sliced into reasonably even shares. The preservation of public order and the administration of justice must be carried out in ways which assure the populace that the state is an honest broker and re- liable arbiter. The state apparatus needs to reflect reasonably the cultural composition of the society. The state which succeeds in demonstrating reasonable standards of probity, integrity, fairness, and effectiveness earns thereby the respect of its populace. As a valued collectivity, it may accumulate a reservoir of support, even without intense commitment to its national personality, which permits it to withstand the inevitable cultural tensions. A fellow feeling of shared membership in a juridical and territorial community worthy of preservation may prepare the ground for a longer-term emer- gence of emotive identification with a nation. A heavy burden necessarily falls upon the elites, to the extent that active attachments to the nation-state are relatively weak or limited to certain regions or groups. At the same time, a measure of consociational</page><page sequence="21">Crawford Young 181 ethos needs to govern the interactions of those who speak for different cultural segments. There is, to some extent, a natural incentive for them to sustain a bargaining relationship; the social classes to which political elites belong are likely to be prime beneficiaries of state action and the greatest potential losers should sustained disorder ensue. On the other hand, elements of the political elite also supply the personnel for cul- tural mobilization, which almost never occurs as a self-generating pro- cess spontaneously germinating amongst the popular sectors. Tension is natural to this situation. A necessary element in its resolution is the extension of benefits to broader segments of the populace. If fellow feeling is to grow, shares in the national cake need to be distributed beyond the cultural elites who are direct participants in the bargaining process. The pressure they feel to maintain their own creditability among their following may also push in this direction. Issues of representation and distribution fuse in the process. An altered mood in addressing these challenges is perceptible in many lands. In India, the national integration thrust of Nehru and the Indian National Congress at the time of independence has given way to more complex patterns of brokering and adjusting the innumerable cultural conflicts embedded in this vast human conglomeration. Consider, for in- stance, the virtual disappearance of the national language issue. When a constitution was drawn up shortly after independence, imposition of Hindi as national language was accepted with little debate. The indefinite postponement of full application of this policy which was once viewed as indispensable to the integrated national state passes equally without dis- cussion. The three-year process of drafting a new constitution in Nigeria also reflected a gradual strategy towards protecting the state from the fissiparous conflicts inherent in the complexity of society. Nation-building, then, is to be viewed with caution. This is not to prophesize the demise of the nation-state. In many third-world coun- tries, and elsewhere, the national idea prospers. In others, it is in abey- ance, though unlikely to be abandoned. But an excessive stress on na- tion-building may exacerbate the problems it seeks to overcome. In a number of cases, its zealous promotion may have perverse consequences for societal harmony. In others, it may be simply unnecessary and better left to develop through natural processes. In the long run, nationalizing the third-world state is by no means impossible, but pursuing this end as a short-term categorical imperative will frequently be self-defeating.</page></plain_text>
