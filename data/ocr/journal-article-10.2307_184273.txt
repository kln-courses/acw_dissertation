<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR* A PHYLOBIOLOGICAL FOREWORDt TRIGANT BURROW As individuals and as communities we have suddenly awakened to find our- selves enveloped in a welter of unprecedented changes-social, political, economic and scientific. If our minds are to keep pace with the restless current on which we are being carried along, if our senses are to become alert to the teeming dislocations that mark the present, it will be necessary to raise our sights to the farther reaches of a rapidly oncoming future. In this hurrying hour the out- standing domains of man's thought are found wanting. Accepted tenets in many fields of his activity are giving way to rapidly broadening concepts. In this moment of new assessments it is safe to predict that the field of psycho- pathology must also gird itself for very radical alterations. It is safe to predict that present-day preoccupations with interpersonal affects, domestic trans- ferences, sexual irregularities, marital conflicts, psychotic episodes, and thevast array of neurotic symptoms that comprise our psychiatric systems will in the scientific reckoning of the future appear to us quite obsolete and inept. They will appear to us as humdrum and archaic, I feel sure, as old wives' tales when contrasted with the basic and encompassing constructs of an organismic phylo- biology. On the basis of phylobiology human behavior and its disorders will be seen as a problem in neurodynamics. The science of human reactions will attempt to deal with the relationship of organism to environment in terms of matter and energy. Such a program will entail a searching study of the function of the brain and its appendages as they mediate man's organismic adaptation to the outer world. Like that of other sciences, it will extend the function of man's brain and enlarge the sphere of his senses. But, unlike the sciences which deal with the data of the external universe, phylobiology will deal with data internal to the universe of man's behavior. It will deal with the internal universe of reactions that underlie man's feeling and thinking. In the midst of the obsessive drives and inhibitions that reflect man's level of thought today-drives and inhibitions to which man has become socially conditioned-an adjustment of his social behavior that is primary and organismic can hardly present a welcome or inviting prospect. The very nature of man's social conditioning makes impossible a viewpoint that transcends his condition- ing. It would be idle, therefore, to expect the psychopathologist to embrace the prospect of so radical a change with enthusiasm, or even equanimity. His traditional thought-patterns, his customary employment of the senses in his * Paper read in outline before the Thirty-third Annual Meeting of the American Psy- chopathological Association, New York, May 15, 1943. t This essay contains material introductory to a book soon to be published. 271</page><page sequence="2">TRIGANT BURROW personal, social, economic, and political relations have too firm a hold upon him to permit so vital a reversal of their habitual course. Indeed the reaction of the psychopathologist can only cause him to cling the more tenaciously to his accustomed thought-patterns.l So that I would not be understood as wishing to intrude for a moment upon the habits of feeling and thinking of any psy- chiatric group. I realize that man's socially conditioned habits of behavior are not susceptible of perfunctory modification. I wish merely to predicate, on the basis of experiments now being conducted by a small group of investigators, what revaluations the future holds for a science of human behavior, and to suggest the likelihood that with further investigations these revaluations may prove comparable to the reconstructions that are now taking place in other fields of man's endeavor. When we consider the modifications that have taken place in the various fields of man's thought, we recognize that all scientific advance has been preceded by an arbitrary sciolism or pseudo-science. As we know, traditional supersti- tion has always antedated systematic inquiry. This was the story of the science of chemistry with its antecedent system of alchemy; of astronomy with its predecessor astrology; and of the science of medicine itself whose forerunners are seen in the mysticism and magic that long prevailed in regard to the structure and function of the human body. But with the introduction of the science of astronomy and the telescope, the "wide and starry" skies became the intimate laboratory of man. With the advent of chemistry the world of matter became equally man's icientific workshop. And in the sciences of physiology and bacteriology, man is once more faced with the practical materials of laboratory analysis. In these progressive transitions metaphysical theory and symbol-juggling have been replaced by the direct observation of structures and their demonstrable function. Habits of mental rationalization have been discarded as outmoded and of no avail. Not so, however, with the domain of man's interrelational physiology-with the domain of reactions that relate the organism of man to his environment and to others of his kind. While it is true that this domain of human ecology too commonly symbolized as the mental sphere is coming to be known more precisely today as the sphere of human behavior, nevertheless superstition and symbol-juggling still dominate this wide domain of man's interrelational experience. The accepted approach to the sphere of human relations still goes hand in hand with the parochial outlook of the astrologer, the alchemist and the tribal medicine man. In the field of man's behavior then-in the field of our so-called mental 1 How difficult it is for the psychiatric mind to achieve a phylic sense of its own involve- ment in a social neurosis The Lifwynn Laboratory has had ample opportunity to observe in the rock-bound inertias of those of its students who are psychopathologists. Not that the behavior of psychopathologists is any less basic or unified than that of others, but as the accredited guardians of the community's health of mind, any ineptness of adaptation on their part is more outstanding. Naturally psychiatrists are no more immune to a disorder intrinsic to man than the rest of the community. 272</page><page sequence="3">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR reactions-there is equally the need that the symbols of sciolism and meta- physical speculation give way to a science of behavior. There is the need that this realm of man's environmental interrelations-interrelations which knit organism and environment into a dynamic unit-serve man likewise as a laboratory of investigation. The primary homeostasis uniting man and his environment constitutes the matrix of phylobiology. For phylobiology is the objective study by man of his own motivations as these motivations mediate between brain and environment and are rendered perceptible within man's own organism. Instead of studying the vast multiplicity of symptoms operating in each individual and in each group of individuals, or crediting with mental labels the endless differentiation of personal motives conditioning this and that individual or group under this or that ever-changing circumstance, phylo- biology seeks to reach the common phylic basis of this infinite complex of shifting and accidental symptoms. It attempts to bring to clear definition the physio- logical substrate of this personal and social symptom-complex by means of a social analysis of phylic processes, and it attempts to render this phyloanalysis as objective as it is comprehensive.2 The work of Willard Gibbs in vector analysis, his penetrating descriptions of energy and "entropy" as factors in the thermodynamics of chemistry3-a research in which he is said to have been the forerunner of Einstein;4 the work of Einstein himself in mathematical physics with its concept of quantum dy- namics; the discoveries of Marconi in the field of wireless telegraphy, and the more recent developments in radio transmission and in electronics; the investiga- tions of Darwin into the developmental processes of animal and plant that led to the concept of evolution; the commensurate researches of Koch and Pasteur in relating the physiology of infectious processes to an unseen agent which they later identified as pathogenic bacteria-all these departures from customary patterns of thought introduced man to a new sphere of the senses, and with it to a new application of the function of man's brain to the environment. But none of these extraordinary discoveries had anything to do with the interrela- tional behavior of man. They placed him in control of new spheres of matter and energy and greatly enriched his understanding of the palpable universe of experience, but they did not place man in organismic control of himself and his own processes in their whole relation to the environment and to others. While these sciences extended the function of man's brain and its special senses, they had nothing to do with human behavior. They had nothing to do with man's internal imbalances of function as evidenced in the widespread symptomatology of social man, with his compulsive and erratic wishes, with his vacillating choices between what he fondly calls the "right" course and the 2 Burrow, Trigant, The Biology of Human Conflict-An Anatomy of Behavior, Individual and Social, New York and London, The Macmillan Company, 1937, xl + 435 pp. 3 Gibbs, Willard, Collected Works of J.

In other words, the physical and biological sciences have thus far had nothing to do with the ever- pressing problem of man's disposition to.internal conflict. They have had nothing to do with a conflict that is internal to man as a species and that mani- fests itself symptomatically throughout the world in an unequal allotment of economic opportunity and the right of survival; with a conflict that has resulted in adaptive regressions and neurosis, in industrial disturbances, in political and international disorders, in crime and war. 2 All processes are governed by laws that are intrinsic to them. Animal organ- isms react to their environment in accordance with these inherent laws. This orthogenic response preserves the organism's interreactive consistency. With the acquisition by man of the symbolic faculty, or of knowledge, with man's acquirement of an epigenic plane of reaction, he was still subject to this same law of the organism.5 For the symbolic capacity came about through the increasing submission of man's projective senses to the consistent relations existing within the world about him-its dependable order and sequences. It came about through the agreement of his own sequence of sense-reactions with the sequence of reactions existing outside him. Only man's neural conformity to the observ- able consistency of external phenomena has made possible the consistency of his own responses. Only this unvarying parallelism between external stimulus and internal response has established the law or nomen that determines man's mental reactions. This is the significance of the symbol. It is what the indices of science are. It is the meaning of scientific law and of nomenclature. The nomenclature of a science consists of a systematized body of symbols or indices that mean what they say. It consists of symbols and meanings that have back of them a de- pendable body of experimentally controlled data. The data obtained through such a system of symbols express man's neural reaction to the objects and processes for which these symbols stand. Heat and cold, gases and solids, solubility and insolubility are states of matter to which man's senses maintain a consistent relation because of the consistency of their response to these en- vironmental manifestations. Thus the laws of man's mental behavior have consisted in an increasing correspondence of his sense-reactions with the external data impinging upon them. This organismic consistency embodies a principle of response that insures the organism's unity of behavior. In this organismic generalization there is contained the sovereign principle upon which all scien- tific knowledge rests. But in man's early use of the symbol, his mental reactions were not always in accord with the manifestations occurring in the external world. Man did 5 The term orthogenic refers to the organism's primary pattern of reaction, while epigenic refers to reactions that are secondary and accessory. 274</page><page sequence="5">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR not always adhere to the consistent relation between his senses and the outer object. In the distortions of his early mental perspectives be "believed" the sun to be "God." The shadows that lay upon the hills or on the sea he "thought" were "spirits," friendly or menacing. Man did not reckon with the physical law or nomen that accounted for the violent repercussions accompanying an electrical storm. To him thunder was the anger of God., The principles of astronomy and meteorology were as yet unknown to him. The scientific laws of chemistry and physics were still a closed book. Nowhere had the nomen established its anchor of validity within the newly acquired sphere of man's symbolic behavior. And so, as more and more man took over the sign or spoken word in sub- stitution for the reaction of his organism as a whole, as more and more he adopted an epigenic in place of an orthogenic plane of behavior, he lost touch increasingly with the hard and fast impact of outer actuality. With the growing domination of man's processes by the symbolic part-brain there was no longer the sure touch of objective solidarity, but only the symbolic authority of this or that epigenic index. With the replacement of man's primary orthogenic behavior by a purely affective or epigenic response man's organism was seriously thrown out of balance in its relation to the environment. There occurred a fundamental dislocation within man's interrelational behavior or within the ecology of man's organism as a species. As regards man's behavior-motivation there was not now the consistent correlation between the response of man's sense-organs and the object or stimulus external to them.6 6 Speaking of behavior, through some ineptness in habits of human reckoning, the posi- tion of phylobiology is not infrequently confused with the school of the Semanticists. The position of Korzybski is, of course, rightly described as an attempt to explain disorders of behavior as a confusion and inconsistency in the use of symbols or language. Needless to say, I would not for a moment wish to deprecate the notable work of Count Korzybski. But I must demur at the persistent tendency among students of behavior to align the re- searches of my associates and myself with the principles of the Semantic school. The method of phylobiology does not make contact with the school of the Semanticists at any point. It is our explicit position that the attempt to account for neurosis by disparaging the symbols of language is putting the cart before the horse. Contrary to the teaching of Korzybski we have insisted upon the essentially veridical character of man's verbal forms of interchange within the social setting in which they are employed. Far from concerning ourselves with the symbol, our attack has centred solely upon the affects with which the symbols of language are commonly cluttered. Rather than seek to explain the evidences of man's distorted behavior-motivations on a purely ideational basis, it has been our effort to trace these disorders to their physiological substrate. We have regarded the verbal frames on which the community's behavior-distortions are hung as relatively quite innocuous epiphenomena, and have consistently emphasized the biophysiological basis of behavior- disorders. In our finding it is not the letter but the spirit of the word that betrays the underlying pathology, of its meaning. The plausible explanation offered by the legendary youngster who, contrary to orders, ventured into the gooseberry patch may be trivial but it is to the point. She had followed her mother's instructions to the letter. Having been tempted by the devil to disobey, she had done exactly as she had been told and promptly cried out: "Get thee behind me Satan." Yes, she had adhered to the letter religiously but, as she herself explained, that was the whole trouble. Satan did get behind her but from this advantageous position straightway 275</page><page sequence="6">TRIGANT BURROW 3 Phylobiological investigations indicate that this interruption to the consistent reactions of man is due to an impediment in man's behavior as a species and that this impediment is incidental to his acquisition of the symbolic function. It has been our finding that this disturbed reaction is social and that it is trace- able to a peculiarly insidious image that unconsciously colors man's mental processes. There is evidence that this social image with which man's interrela- tional life has become invested is tied up with early anthropomorphic strains, that it is linked with intimations of the supernatural.7 For the sake of con- venience I shall give this superstitious factor in man's behavior the name of numen, a word that means "divine will" and that implies the presence of some mystical, non-objective immanence.8 Because of its radically distorted empathy or feeling-tone, this unconscious numen has given an entirely false color to the sense of self expressed socially as 'I,' 'me' or 'mine.' In its superstitious dissociation this cherished numen, both individual and social, disavows the organism's orthogenic basis of motivation- its phylo6rganismic principle of behavior-and instead assumes an epigenic self-impersonation that is esoteric and without biological warrant (superstitious Latin super, above + stare, to stand. Cf. Greek, ertirao-as, standing above). By virtue of its artificial prerogative this secondarily improvised 'I'-persona regards itself as something hallowed, as something set apart and sacrosanct. From its epigenic pinnacle this numinal immanence that pervades man's proc- esses has become socially untouchable. Yet the existence socially of this fond illusion has been all the while wholly unsuspected by us. Indeed so unsuspected is it that this inflated self-image now everywhere exercises complete supremacy over the interrelational processes of man.9 There is growing evidence that this numinal impediment to the accurate correspondence of man's senses in respect to outer relations and events is ul- timately traceable to a dislocation in the neurodynamic function of man's pushed her into the gooseberry patch! What, indeed, avails the letter of the symbol against the spirit of the affect? Does any of us in his heart of hearts doubt the answer? But "the heart" is not consulted. The truth is, we are not interested in the organism's basic mood or empathy, but are completely caught up in the social reflexes of the part-brain and its affecto-symbolic habits of motivation. 7 Burrow, Trigant, "Social Images versus Reality," The Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Social Psychology, 1924, Vol. XIX, pp. 230-235. 8 As it happens the term numen possesses special etymological aptness in the present context because both in form and pronunciation it presents a sharp contrast linguistically to the word nomen from which it differs by only a single vowel. 9 The casual employment of the numen may be seen in the habitual intonation accom- panying such early nursery admonitions as "Mother said no," the implication being that "mother" is some sort of rare, transcendent spirit, a being not of this earth. Usually the ultimatum is supported by a look of relentless finality as prolonged as it is devastating. The reader will recall how Columbus consciously invoked the numen for his own practical purposes when, in anticipation of a lunar eclipse, he affected to possess supernatural powers and thus coerced the Indians to his will by threatening to extinguish the light of the moon. 276</page><page sequence="7">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR organism as a phylum, and that it is therefore susceptible of objective definition and localization. In its symptomatic aspects this phyloorganismic deviation first manifested itself in the reactions we were able to observe socially through our group-method of analysis-a method which posits the total organism as the instrument of observation and from this total basis proceeds to analyze reactions that are epigenic to it.lo Through this phyloanalytic method we found that a persistent affect-distortion pervades the reactions of the social community generally and obstructs its interrelational function throughout. We found that because of this obstruction the private opinions of social man with their personal criteria of interpretation constantly override the natural acquiescence of man's senses in response to data presented to them. With the passing of this shadow of affect over the mind of man, with the obtrusion of this extraneous image or numen upon man's senses, it is not surpris- ing that his mental perspectives have lost their original clarity and have become obscured.ll It is not surprising that there was no longer the clear-cut response of the organism to the environment-that man began to see in this or that outer object or phenomenon a quality or meaning not inherent in the object itself. For now the object too often possessed for him only the meaning with which he arbitrarily invested it, and from now on man's world came to be tinged with fanciful attributes of his own making-with affective intimations and discolor- ings wholly alien to the objective circumstance. With the interruption of man's phyloorganismic fidelity to external stimuli, with the accession of the epigenic persona and the intrusion of private affects upon the symbolic function, the organism of man sustained a biological trauma of incalculable severity. Through this phylic trauma man's primary orthogenic behavior in relation to the environment was artificially shifted to a level of response that was purely fictitious. Substituting a superstitious, numinal interpretation of the phenomenal world for the world of objective reality, man unconsciously abrogated the law or nomen that governs his interrelational 10 There can be no societal science in' the absence of societal material. One might as well propose a science of chemistry in the absence of the elements that are the material of chemistry. Since the inception of the work of my associates and myself there have arisen many schools of group-therapy. I wish, however, to state once more that contrary to pre- vailing assumption there exists no common principle between the organismic research in human behavior comprised under phyloanalysis and the interpersonal exchanges that comprise these more recent methods of group-therapy. From nursery to forum recourse to the remedial benefit of interpersonal exchange has been as automatic as any other com- munity or tribal reflex. Whatever merit these various talking cures may possess socially, it is important that the method of phyloanalysis be very clearly differentiated from such inter-symbolic forms of psychotherapy. It is the special distinction of phyloanalysis that verbal interchange per se has no part in it, that these symbolic expressions are epiphe- nomena which are implicitly discredited from the point of view of the organism's motiva- tion. The sole aim of the phyloanalytic technique is to demarcate between tensions which are partitive and falsely motivated, and tensions which are biologically integrated and organismic. 11 This phylobiological obstruction is doubtless indicated in the symbolic record of man's original sin as related in the Book of Genesis. According to etymological authority the primary meaning of sin was a missing of the mark, a faux pas. 277</page><page sequence="8">TRIGANT BURROW behavior. Under the sponsorship of a whimsical social image or numen there was no longer the consistent correlation of man's senses with external phenomena. Man's behavior henceforth became exempt from the inexorable control of organismic law.12 Having fashioned an esoteric image of himself, it was not difficult for man to fashion the esoteric wonder-image he called God. Through this mental ven- triloquy of the affecto-symbolic part-brain there was begotten the phylic illusion of anthropomorphism. This early anthropomorphic mechanism established an affective kinship between man's image of himself and his image of God.13 If the God of day and night, of the thunder and lightning was wonderful, so was man wonderful in having created "God" in his own likeness. In his numinal transference man and God were really one. The next step was simple. Auto- matically man now proceeded to establish arbitrarily the mutual interests of these complemental images upon a reciprocal basis. Deprived of a sense of his organism's dependable reciprocity in relation to the environment, man had no other recourse than to seek compensation in this artificial image-dichotomy.'4 Having lost contact with the principle of harmonious interaction between his organism and the environment, man was compelled to atone the loss of his organism's primary homeostatic balance through the vicarious security he con- jured in the mere symbol of a benign and all-embracing Father-protector. Through this handy process man was no longer subservient to the fixed nomen governing all dependable experience. The power that makes for harmony and order in the universe of matter and energy was now something quite alien to him. The neurodynamics of man's organism was no longer an expression of this universal motivation, but a thing apart and henceforth subject to the private will of man. Now that a whimsical numen or false image of authority had replaced the authority that resides in the consistent correspondence between man's senses and the external world, his organism was no longer bound by a consistent law of behavior. The omniscient and omnipotent principle or nomen that resides within man's organism and that governs his relationship to the environment lacked the organismic support of conscious correlation. From now forward man could believe as his fancy dictated, not as his senses ordained. Such is the dictatorial sovereignty of the social numen.15 12 Burrow, Trigant, "The Law of the Organism-A Neuro-Social Approach to the Prob- lems of Human Behavior," The American Journal of Sociology, 1937, Vol. XLII, pp. 814-824.

Cf. Anglo-Saxon, geleafa, also le6f. Such "beliefs" should be carefully discriminated from inferences regarding objective data based upon inconclusive evidence. 278</page><page sequence="9">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR 4 How then is man to recover the consistent function of his senses? How is man's participation in the dependable sequences that preserve the universal order of his responses to be reestablished? Only in the measure in which man succeeds in throwing off the social influence of this phylic numen will he be able to employ the larger resources of the senses and restore the function of the brain as a whole in relation to the environment. It was this reassertion of the whole brain of man that made possible the discovery of the bacterial origin of infectious diseases with all its sweeping phylic implications-implications which consisted in man's recognition of his susceptibility as a species to the pathogenic invasion of his tissues by an alien organism. Through this restoration of man's larger faculties communicable diseases were for the first time in man's history accorded their true phylic import. Disease was no longer the special distinction of the isolated individual. In this new field of medicine there was no longer the palling influence of the private self-image or numen, and there could no longer be the prerogatory isolation of the individual as a separate biological entity. The myth which explained disease as the expression of a divinity whose infinite wisdom selected this or that individual or community for special immolation or punishment ceased to exercise over man its hitherto potent charm. But this sudden awakening to a science of bacteriology (and this awakening occurred, be it remembered, but two or three generations ago) took place only in the sphere of those reactions which related man's organism to a condition in the external environment. Like the sciences of chemistry and electrody- namics, the science of bacteriology had nothing whatever to do with the organis- mic behavior of man himself. As far as concerns the sphere of those reactions which embrace the interrelations of individuals in their behavior toward one another-as far as concerns those subjective affects which now everywhere color and distort the natural coordination of man as a species-no phylic prin- ciple of behavior and hence no phylic concept of the organism's behavior-devia- tions has as yet penetrated the consciousness of man as a community or phylum. Within the sphere of man's own behavior the numen continues to hold un- challenged sway. Primitive man was not fastidious in his employment of this numinal legerde- main. He did not hesitate to apply the numen to any object or situation that was not immediately obvious in its actuality. Due, however, to the abrogation by social man of an organismic principle of reasoning in respect to his own behavior, we find that even today man's mental and social processes are similarly cluttered with the remnants of a primitive mentation and superstition. While, with the coming of the various scientific disciplines respecting outer objects, man's superstitious or anthropomorphic numen in relation to the outer world was gradually dispelled, there still persists this same transcendental or numinal attitude toward man's interrelational behavior as a phylum. There is to be found the presence of the numen and its prerogatory assumptions wherever man's behavioral relation to man is involved-in his various institutions, politi- cal, religious, national, and economic; in his various interrelational contacts, 279</page><page sequence="10">TRIGANT BURROW social, commercial, familial and conjugal. This superstitious residue will not be eradicated until there is organized an equally objective approach to the sphere of man's own reactions. On the basis of the numen any individual or any nation is at liberty to believe whatever he likes to believe in regard to his own conduct or that of any other individual or nation. Even today within the field of man's behavior no biological law has yet been established for determining the validity of the organism's reactions. As yet no scientifically accepted nomen declares the biological veridity of the organism's reaction in its relation to the environment or to others of its kind. 5 The numen is of course the factor that has for centuries operated uncon- sciously throughout the arts of mental healing. The numen with its artificial projection of the father-image is indeed the very mainspring of methodsj'of therapy based upon interpersonal suggestion. With Freud an attempt was made to give this factor explicit recognition, and under the name of the trans- ference it was presumably raised to the level of a conscious therapeutic technique. "No transference," said Freud, "no psychoanalysis." But Freud failed to reckon with the phylic implications of the numen, because he failed to reckon with the numina or social images in the community around him. Freud failed to reckon with this unconscious behavioral numen as a deviate phylic structure, because he did not reckon with the numen that colored and fashioned his own epigenic persona; and psychiatry, in its transference toward Freud, has religiously failed to recognize it along with him.l6 This factor of the numen as it operates in the physician-patient relationship remains still an essential feature of psy- chiatric procedure. This unconscious mechanism of the transference has not been raised to the level of a conscious program of healing after all. Like the rest of individuals and communities, psychiatrists still labor under the yoke of this prevalent affect-impediment as it exists within the social community. As yet the psychopathologist does not see that the inconsistencies of the individual patient stem from a phylic inconsistency that characterizes equally the social mind of man. Within the limited scope of the numinal outlook it could not be otherwise. The psychopathologist constantly witnesses incon- sistency and vacillation in the attention and adaptation of his patients, but he can get no further. Being blocked in his social perspectives, his observa- tions achieve nothing more than a catalogue of symptoms. In his small book, Reflections on War and Death, Freud makes this extra- ordinary statement: "It is indeed a mystery why the individual members of nations should disdain, hate and abhor each other at all, even in times of peace. I do not know why it is." Had Freud recognized the social implications of the 16 As I remarked some years ago, "The transference or the social image is not a sporadic phenomenon. It is by no means limited to the neurotic personality. It is the early and persistent prepossession of every individual living under the sway of our present social system."

But unless we under- stand the conflict that is recognizable within our own neurodynamic processes, we cannot understand the conflict of either the social community or the neurotic. Just as the psychoneurotic construes his socio-symbolic affects as real in the absence of a phyloanalysis, in the same way the so-called normal community construes its socio-symbolic affects as real in the absence of a phyloanalysis. It was Freud's limitation in respect to human behavior and its disorders that he remained aloof from a neurosis that affects man as a species. This limitation is one in which Freud does not lack company among psychopathologists today. We shall not tackle the problem of human dissociation with its secret wish- fulfillments so long as we confine our inquiries to states of isolated mentation and withdrawal, to the fantasies occurring in the dreams of sleep, to the dissocia- tions of schizophrenia, hysteria, and of psychoneurotic processes generally. It is necessary for us to include expressions of deviation in their social manifesta- tion. It is necessary for us to discover in the historic records of language, in the processes of politics and economics, as well as in the conventional interests of our daily human interchange, the ever-present earmarks of neurosis and disorganization. We little recognize the dictatorial influence of the father- image in our current social relationships. We are little aware of the presence of this numinal or authoritarian impersonation within our own psychiatric ranks. We do not at all see the extent to which the authority of this epigenic or so-called wishful image obstructs all possibility of an objective inquiry into the behavior of man as a species. Under its blind impositions we fail equally to realize that the underlying processes of democracy, depending as they do upon the "votes" of the people, are again a wishful form of government or patriarchal jurisdiction-that in the etymology of the word vote and the word wish, for example, there is betrayed a common phylobiological origin.18 In our dis- sociated naivet6 we proceed upon the day's activities with competitive "avidity," and, in the absence of phylobiological sources, we fail to sense that the motivation that is marked by avidity (Latin, avere) is again the motivation that is marked by the wish. Due to the habitual decoys of our traditional social numina we have not begun to suspect the degree in which our own processes are shot through with the sick lures of unreality. 17 Syz, Hans, "The Concept of the Organism-as-a-Whole and its Application to Clinical Situations," Human Biology, 1936, Vol. VIII, pp. 489-507.

But these obstacles to the correct functioning of the brain of man affected only his intellectual appreciation of the objects and situations about him. A far more serious and formidable impediment to man's clear adaptation exists in the hindrances and confusion that obstruct his appreciation of the origin and mean- ing of his own behavior and its underlying motivation. In man's confusion before the world of outer facts and relationships the obstacle besetting his path is to be traced merely to a false habit of reasoning. But the obstacle to man's clear perception within the field of his own behavior is to be traced not only to a false habit of reasoning but also to a false habit of mood, feeling or will. This is a vitally significant distinction. It is a distinction that points up with new insistence the very urgent problem of man's needed reconstruction in relation to an increasingly complex environment. It points up this problem as one calling for the enlargement of the senses of man and a broadening of the function of man's brain as it relates his organism to the outer world. Undoubtedly the nineteenth century biologists took a bold step when they posited the theory of evolution in respect to living forms. By virtue of this step science automatically declared in favor of an organismic principle of behavior throughout animal and plant life. And from the standpoint of their projective or symbolic reasoning these early students of biology applied the laws of evolu- tion equally of course to man himself. In doing so, they dared to release at least man's external reason from the arbitrary sovereignty of an unconscious numinalism. But from the point of view of man's internal reason or will, from the point of view of the organism's epigenic behavior, man still demands exemp- tion from this generic principle implicit in an organismic science of behavior. In his secret apotheosis of the social numen, or the esoteric 'I'-persona, man con- tinues to cling to the fanciful image of divine protection which his private will, his wishful "reasoning," has arbitrarily created in behalf of his personal comfort and safekeeping. This, in the finding of phylobiology, is the essential mechan- ism of the social neurosis. While medical and other objective investigations have gone forward by leaps and bounds, the objective observation by man of his own subjective pathology- the scientific study of a radical deviation in the organismic behavior of man himself-still awaits the recognition and participation of the larger community of scientists involved in it. In the work of the small group of investigators to which I have alluded the attempt has been made to bring to controlled laboratory inquiry this all too neglected problem of man's unwitting interference with the function of his own organism in its community or species solidarity. We have attempted to bring to objective inquiry the unconscious mechanism of the social numen as this social mechanism is observable in the phyloanalysis of social groups. This investigation requires that man recognize within himself 282</page><page sequence="13">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR his substitution of a purely affecto-symbolic nexus of interrelations for his intra- organismic integrity of function as a species. It requires our recognition that man's cherished numen is the insubstantial stuff of human relations, and that this dislocation in man's mental adaptation imposes a relentless servitude upon the free processes of us all. Only the dominance of this epigenic numen can account for the phylically bizarre and inconsistent situation in which conflict and destructiveness have superseded the integrative forces of unity and co6pera- tion throughout the race of man. In its phylic reorientation the mind of man will be capable of compassing a far broader outlook, of bringing a wholly altered frame of reference to bear upon the many problems of his behavior, personal, civic; and international. In accordance with phylobiological principles we need not shrink from seeing that the social behavior that is called "normal" is measured by purely epigenic standards and that this social norm bears no relation to the biological norm of behavior embodied in the organism's orthogenic standards of motivation.19 We shall not hesitate to concede the biological alignment between the epigenic plane of man's reactions and his neurosis, between habits of affective thinking and crime (crime is from Latin, cernere, to think; cf. Greek, KplVPEW). We need not be afraid to recognize that the behavior expressed by either the criminal or the neurotic represents a type of reaction that issues inevitably from the interrelational standards of so-called "normal" communities. We need not fear to see that the recurrent incidence of war is the inevitable complement of the purely numinal charades we know as peace. We shall see without flinching that the type of religion or devotion that is descended from early anthropomor- phic traditions is numinally bonded from the outset, that in its epigenic origin this type of thinking and feeling is necessarily irreconcilable with a science of human behavior (religion = Latin religare, to bind or hold back). Correspond- ingly we shall see that science is man's impartial fidelity to organismic law or to the nomen, and that in its rejection of wishful, self-interested habits of thinking science embodies man's highest expression of devotion (devotion = Latin de, away from, and votum, the wish). In the altered outlook of phylobiology the change in the attitude of medicine toward what are now called mental disorders will be as radical as was the change in the attitude of medicine toward what were called "fever disorders" before the science of bacteriology revolutionized our interpretation of these communicable diseases. As we know, it was only a short time ago that students of medicine assigned the source of the blood-flow to the liver rather than to the heart. But medicine errs no less today when it mistakes the true function of the brain and its senses in relating man's organism to the environment. The brain with its senses is primarily an instrument that co6rdinates and balances the organism's internal and external environments. Basically man's behavior- motivation is in no way related to the epigenic vagaries that issue from man's partitive 'I'-persona-the reaction that has its collective expression in the social 19 Burrow, Trigant, "Preliminary Report of Electroencephalographic Recordings in Relation to Behavior Modifications," The Journal of Psychology, 1943, Vol. 15, pp. 109-114. 283</page><page sequence="14">TRIGANT BURROW neurosis. On the contrary, motivation is as fundamental to the organism's behavior as protoplasm is to its structure. Through Darwin we have learned that the behavior of the lower animals, and of plants as well, is motivated throughout the species by an organismic principle of solidarity.2 Of course, in the absence of man's symbolic capacity, the lower animals lack the aptitude of mental projection. Without the speciali- zation of function whereby man negotiates his world in terms of the concept, these lower forms have not man's facility for the conscious correlation of external data. We know too that it was by virtue of the consistent fidelity of man's sense-impressions, as mentioned earlier, that the organism's orthogenic pattern of motivation was carried over into the sphere of his symbolic behavior. But it was just here in this phylo6rganismic reorientation that there occurred a serious faux pas. It was just here that man's use of the symbol came to play its partitive role in man's relation to man. However unwittingly, it happened that the interrelational function of man's brain was shunted into purely epigenic or affective channels of reaction. In the growing complexity, therefore, of man's affecto-symbolic behavior his social adaptation has become seriously confused. Indeed, because of this adaptive impediment in the biology of man's conscious- ness, his interrelational behavior is in greater need of adjustment today than at any time in the history of his development. I have cited many instances of man's projective ingenuity as he applies his symbolic faculty to the external object or situation, but none of these extra- ordinary applications of the brain of man to fields of inquiry outside of himself has in any way promoted man's clearer knowledge of his own behavior. None of them has contributed in the least toward creating a laboratory of inquiry into processes that activate man's own organism, including the interrelational function of the brain of man itself. Not only have these inquiries failed to contribute anything to man's basic acquaintance with himself and with the laws of his own organism, but their effect has been precisely to lead his mind away from the study of his own processes. The present accession of conflict and self-destruction throughout the world should offer sufficient evidence of the social welter of affects into which man has been plunged. In face of this widespread disorder of function in our bionomic life, we can hardly disguise from ourselves the extent to which distorted out- looks have replaced the constructive aims of the organism's balanced motivation. 7 To the phylobiologist nothing appears more urgent than the application of the larger function of the brain and senses of man to the problem of his be- havior-dysfunction as a species. Nothing appears of greater interest and significance than the discovery of measures that will make possible the demarca- tion between man's partitive and his total patterns of reaction in relation to the 20 Gait, William, "The Principle of Cooperation in Behavior," The Quarterly Review of Biology, 1940, Vol. 15, pp. 401-410. 284</page><page sequence="15">THE NEURODYNAMICS OF BEHAVIOR environment.21 To this end it has been the effort of my associates and myself to give physiological definition or delimitation to man's partitively (affectively) conditioned brain-segment as it mediates man's symptomatic or symbolic sphere of behavior. In demarcating the affecto-symbolic substrate underlying the behavior of man, we have attempted to contrast the incitements that pertain to this conditioned reaction-segment, and thus segregate the organism's epigenic behavior-reactions from the motivations of man's organism as an orthogenic whole. This may seem a large order. Indeed, from the narrow viewpoint of the conditioned part-brain of man, it is a large order-so large, in fact, as to appear quite beyond the possibility of fulfillment. But from the viewpoint of the organism's basic orientation this position becomes infinitely simpler than the position maintained by psychopathologists today in respect to man's disorders of behavior. As Willard Gibbs has said, "The whole is simpler than the sum of all its parts." In the finding of phylobiology, it is only because man has been divisively or partitively conditioned from infancy that his habit of outlook is now biased by the limitations of a part or personalistic view of his own organismic reactions. It is for this reason that he does not see the problem of behavior as the phylic whole that it is. It is for this reason that each separately conditioned unit, whether individual, community or nation, now strives obsessively to pro- mote its separately conditioned claim or advantage above that of others in defiance of a common principle of species solidarity. In the attempt to demarcate between these two neurodynamic patterns of behavior-between man's orthogenic and his epigenic behavior-reactions-I was led to return again to an early field of interest and to investigate the function of attention.22 As the function of attention mediates between the brain and the environment, it is to this field that one would naturally look in inquiring into man's interrelational behavior and its disorders. Examining the function of attention as an ecological or interrelational process, it was possible to discrimi- nate two distinct aspects of this function. One, in which the numen or affecto- symbolic image was dominant, I called ditention because of the invariable element of distraction due to the intrusion of the self-image. The other, in which the affective or numinal element was eliminated and the organism's total relatibn to the environment resumed its primary unconditioned supremacy, I called cotention. I need hardly say that in the early phase of our experimental work cotention was attained only to the degree in which ditention or affecto- symbolic attention was suspended. It was only later that cotention exercised its function as the positive intra relational process that it is. In previous writings I have described these two aspects of the attentive process as well 21 Syz, Hans, "Burrow's Differentiation of Tensional Patterns in Relation to Behavior Disorders," The Journal of Psychology, 1940, Vol. 9, pp. 153-163. 22 Burrow, Trigant, "The Determination of the Position of a Momentary Impression in the Temporal Course of a Moving Visual Impression" (Doctoral Thesis), The Johns Hopkins Studies in Philosophy and Psychology, No. 3, Psychological Monographs, 1909, Vol. XI, pp. 1-63. 285</page><page sequence="16">TRIGANT BURROW as their relation to the problem of behavior and its disorders. I have also de- scribed the internal patterns of tension by which these two processes may be recognized in their underlying physiology and have indicated their biological significance relative to man's needed adjustment. These physiological altera- tions were noted chiefly through kymograph records of the respiratory function,23 through recordings of brain-wave patterns,24 and through photographic records of eye-movements made in ditention and in cotention.25 8 The discrepancy between the outer manifestations of the schizophrenic and his internal mood has long been recognized. This type of patient will relate the most tragic personal experience but, in relating it, he will wear a countenance of beaming complacency. This condition of the schizophrenic mind is not unique. This behavioral inconsistency is characteristic equally of the social mind of man. Socially the mind of man may quite sincerely assume an outer aspect that completely belies the undependable vacillations of mood that lie beneath it. This is a situation with which we need seriously to reckon. Twenty-five years ago we resolved that the world war-"the first world war"- was to be also the last world war. That was the mind of man. That was what man thought. But we did not reckon with his mood. We did not reckon with the shifting and uncertain caprices of man's feeling. And so today we are fighting what we call the second world war, and in this second world war the mind of man is already busy laying plans to offset a third world war. But once more the mood of man-his covert, unpredictable feeling-is not taken into account. We persistently fail to reckon with the fact that wars are not fought in response to a mental attitude, but that these recurrent episodes are the out- come of man's recurrent moods. The reason is that the mood and the mind of man, like the mood and the mind of the psychotic, do not intermesh at any point. They exist within wholly separate categories of behavior, and their motivation is innervated by brain-patterns whose areas of function are wholly different. If as a community we fail to take cognizance of the mood of man, if we fail to take cognizance of the specific functional area or part-brain that is concomitant to the mood or numinal motivation of man, we can only fail to define and control this functional area of the brain. In spite of our literary effusions in book, periodical or scientific journal, the mood of man, like the mood of the schizophrenic, can only mislead us, and in its own time and season drive us headlong into another world-devastating paroxysm of antagonism and warfare.26 23 Burrow, Trigant, "Kymograph Studies of Physiological (Respiratory) Concomitants in Two Types of Attentional Adaptation," Nature, 1938, Vol. 142, p. 156.

But we have not yet, as a consensus of scientific observers, established a systematically controlled body of facts within the frame of our own organismic capacities as a phylum. In our habitual preoccupation with the segment of the brain that mediates the function of attention in relation to the outside item or event, we have lost sight of that function of the brain that mediates an awareness of behavior indigenous to the phylo6rganism itself. In having yielded ourselves entirely to the field of attention as a function of projection we have correspond- ingly neglected the field of interests that are cotentive and organismic.27 It would seem that in the interest of the larger sphere of the senses future students of behavior will repudiate the supremacy of the part-brain and with it the narrow domestic preoccupations of a purely interpersonal psychiatry. The time is undoubtedly approaching when instead of clinging to such partitive interpretations as rest upon a false dichotomy of motivation-instead of adhering to psychiatry's affecto-symbolic system of numenclature-we shall cultivate the larger function of the brain as a whole, and with it such symbols as will be commensurate with a wider employment of the senses. When this time comes 1943, Vol. LVII, pp. 155-165), Lewis G. Westgate reviews the life span of the genus homo and assembles an imposing list of its vast assets and achievements. No one has better described the progress of man's mental growth. But toward the close of his impressive summation the author pertinently adds: "Millions are spent for research in technology, for improving glass, rubber, corn and hogs; very little for the study of man himself. One sickens at the billions now necessarily given for war, all of which would be unneeded in a decently ordered society; and thinks what tremendous advances the wide use of a fraction of that wealth would bring about if devoted to the problem of man." Finally he asks whether man shall not readjust his behavior in the interest of a better world for all people. In answer he says: ,'There is no question but that he has the necessary intelligence. The mind that can weigh the infinitely distant stars and tell their make-up, that can track down the minute carriers of disease . . . can solve its social problems when and if it decides to do so." But the mind of man can solve its social problems only when and if he decides to examine objectively his habitual social numina, his own false mood. This disordered mood of man the author does not reckon with. He does not reckon with man's sick will, or with the obstacle the will of man stubbornly opposes to the clear operation of his intelligence wherever it is question of his own behavior. That man can accomplish all that he has accomplished in intellectual fields, and yet spend billions upon a world-war which would be unthinkable in a decently ordered society is due, in the finding of phylopathology, to the present impassable gulf between the mind and the mood of man. Yet in spite of the manifest inadequacy of the part-brain in dealing with disordered human relations, man continues to employ this behavior-segment with all the unconscious affects or mood- impediments with which it is beset. Whether or not man likes to challenge his own cher- ished mood, it is the mood of man and its distortions upon which his observations need most urgently to be directed. 27 A phylobiological discussion of the function of the projective segment or part-brain of man may be found in the author's essays, The Structure of Insanity-A Study in Phylo- pathology, London, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd., 1932, p. 25 ff. and "The Human Equation," Mental Hygiene, 1941, Vol. XXV, pp. 210-220. 287</page><page sequence="18">TRIGANT BURROW we shall no longer limit ourselves to interpersonal preoccupations based on the organism's secondary, epigenic conditioning. In our newer outlook we shall envisage such neurodynamic concepts as the primary behavior of the organism in its phylic motivation, and adopt a concept and a nomenclature befitting the or- ganismic integrity of man as a species. This envisagement should afford an insight into the universal conditioning of man in his present social adaptation. It should permit us to sense the dislocation that has occurred in the function of the brain of man as a whole due to the false priority of a partitively constel- lated brain-segment. From such a background it will become possible for man to disavow the currency of mere partitive affects and reestablish the homeostasis of the organism's function as a whole in relation to the environment.28 From such a background it will become possible for man to correct his numinal de- viations of behavior through fostering the laboratory whose material of inquiry is none other than the phyloorganismic processes of man himself. In that laboratory of man's behavior there will be opened to him once more the possi- bility of encompassing a systematized body of facts within the frame of a uni- versal premise.
