<plain_text><page sequence="1">Laurenty, J. S. Les sanza du Congo. Tervuren, 1962. 2 vols. (Mus~e Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren, Belgique, Annales. Nouvelle Serie in-40. Sciences Humaines, no. 3). Pp. xiii, 249, bibliog., diagrs., illus., tables + 43 plate and maps. Dr. Laurenty's book is the first publication in the literature of musical instruments devoted entirely to the sanza. It is a museum catalog issued in two volumes: volume I contains the description of the 467 instruments in the collection. Chapter one, in 188 pages, attempts a classification into 22 in- strument types, then adds 130 pages of tables containing collection number, dimensions, name of collector and date of gift, a drawing of the layout of the blades of each instrument and their measurements, followed by an analy- sis of these measurements. Chapter two attempts to correlate the native designations with the different instrument types; Chapter three, to assign them geographically. Chapter four devotes nine pages (mostly of photos) to "The Role of the Instrument in Native Life"; Chapter five gives the same length to enumeration and reproduction of decoration. "Geographical Conclu- sions," a bibliography and a list of other documentation conclude the first volume. Volume II reproduces all the instruments on 43 plates and gives 3 geographical charts. The two volumes are beautifully produced, the photog- raphy is good and the many drawings of technical details of the instruments are excellent. Two volumes devoted to the study of one instrument should, however,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 225 contain more than measurements. The space devoted to the various aspects of the instrument, as just cited, betrays the author's orientation. In vain do we look anywhere for a mention of the instrument's origin. The sanza is typical of a specific locality and a single race of people. It must have an origin. The author does not tell us, nor does he seem to ask himself that question. He first classifies the instruments by the patterns of blade ar- rangement, of which he distinguishes six types. Blade arrangement means pitches, and the pitches an instrument produces relate it to a musical culture. No deductions are drawn from these pitch arrangements. No comparisons are made with similar layouts, for instance, of pipes in panpipes; the sole function of distinguishing these patterns seemS to be cataloging. The basis of classification is the shape of the sound board, regardless of resonator or blade arrangement. The author does not define that this is the basis, nor does he offer a reason for this choice, a discussion of its validity, a presentation of any meaning of this aspect of the instrument in terms of anything beyond the obvious fact that this makes it easier to count the instruments. Twenty-two groups are thus established. Group one has in common a raft construction of the sound board. Some of the specimens have a gourd resonator separate from the instrument which is held against it when it is played. We do not learn if group one is meant to be played with a resonator or if some are and some are not. Group ten bothers the author a little; it bothers me a great deal. Skulls, turtles, zo6morphic carvings, and thick boards are lumped together under an oval sound board as the uni- fying device; it does not unify. Of the 22 groups thus derived some make sense and many do not. The procedure is attempted for the sake of count- ing and measuring as the aim of instrument studies. That these shapes may have a significance in the native culture, that they may relate to concepts, objects, cultic functions, and, last, but not least, the function of the sound which they produce, seems not to have occurred to the author. After 187 pages of excellent illustrations, enumerations, and measurements, he comes to some conclusions, mostly in percentages, that things are not always what they seem (except 44.1% of the time) and that: "all of these considerations amply justify the use of the monochord [in 1962!] in an organological inves- tigation yet to be undertaken by the museum. By penetrating more intimately into the reality of the facts, it [the monochord I assume] places into the hands of the musicologists a tool of the first importance." Chapter two lists the many native terms for the instrument, somewhat by locality and instrument type; points out what words refer to the material used (wood, bamboo, metal); and makes clear that some of the names refer to the individual blades (as the strings of the Oud have different names in Arabic), some to size and shape-all this is information of value, for which one is indeed grateful. How helpful would be, in this chapter, the systema- tology of chapter one! Instead of being in alphabetical order or in some sort of carefully devised system, all the words are bundled into paragraphs related to the 22 groups. Vainly one looks in this work for the generic term m'bichi given by Stephen Chauvet and specifically attributed to the Warega (Kiwa Province) in the Belgian Congo. This term is also missing in Sachs' Reallexikon but Sachs gives us such terms as ambira, bunduma, ibeka, kankobele, kindanda, lulimba, nsimbi, ompochawa, tsztze (deze in Kirby), none of which are named by Dr. Laurenty. The chapter on geography gives us more numerology obtained through a questionnaire distributed by the author to various people in the different provinces of the Congo. The text of the inquiry is not quoted but it certainly</page><page sequence="3">226 BOOK REVIEWS must have grown out of the author's method of measuring everything, and the answers therefore do not seem to bring us any more enlightenment about the instrument. Chapter four sums up the instrument as follows: "Few ethnological ob- jects have been debased to so low a rank and play a role so little occult as the sanza. It does not seem to participate in any secret society and only rarely takes part in a parade. . . ." These conclusions are statistically bol- stered by the "Questionnaire Knosp." They contrast strangely with the chap- ter following which is devoted to the decoration of the instrument. If there is no function, why should there be ornament? Why should the makers of an instrument so declass6 go to the trouble to carve as beautifully as the ex- amples on pages 232 and 233 show us? Again, Dr. Laurenty merely cata- logs-by triangles, squares, lozenges, curves, and faces. He fails to distin- guish between ornament of design and ornament of the shape itself: boat shapes, turtle shapes, phallic shapes, anthropomorphic shapes-none of these has any meaning to him beyond the statistical. He makes nothing of the fact that the sanza shown in illustration 125 is made of a human skull and that the use of a human skull must imply a deep magical significance. One wishes for the eyes of a Max Raphael. One of the characteristics of the sanza is the frequent presence of sym- pathetic rattles. The author never once mentions their existence. He cites, as a decoration, the presence on an instrument of colored porcelain beads wreathed around the blades (p. 229) and refers to tin discs nailed to several instruments (illustration 321). In the cross-section of a sound box the pres- ence of pebbles can be seen, but it is not mentioned in the text (p. 31, drawing no. 41). The most common form of rattle, a metal sleeve pulled over the blade which rattles as the blade vibrates, can be seen in volume II on about 75 of the instruments shown, but there is no comment. As if mere comment were enough! Dr. Laurenty's book has value because of the illustrations of the instru- ment, the bibliography, and the classification system, which may be useful.
