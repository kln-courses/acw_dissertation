<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALLACE STEVENS AND THE SCIENTIFIC IMAGINATION Judith McDaniel "There would be real novelty in [modern poetry] if it had worked out a satisfactory artistic method for dealing with abstractions," wrote Aldous Huxley in 1923. He was referring particularly to those abstrac- tions of modern science and concludes that "that rare phenomenon, the poet in whose mind ideas are a passion and a personal moving force,"1 has not yet appeared. I believe the qualities Huxley refers to have now appeared in the work of Wallace Stevens. And if this is true, then the questions that must be asked about his poetry are, in what way did Stevens take to himself the new ideas of modern science (with all of its implications for every branch of modern thought), and how have these ideas shaped his poetry? In 1948, in a frequently quoted excerpt from the essay "Imagina- tion as Value," Stevens declared his subject matter for poetry to be "the earth." "The great poems of heaven and hell have been written," he maintained, "and the great poem of the earth remains to be writ- ten."2 Blackmur refers to Stevens' subject as "a meditation, with instances, of man's struggle with nature."3 And Wylie Sypher believes that "one of Wallace Stevens' achievements was to bring back into poetry a rebellious and loving dialogue with nature, a chant of men who perish on summer mornings when quails spontaneously cry."4 1 Aldous Huxley, Collected Essays (New York: Bantam, 1960), p. 94. 2 Wallace Stevens, Necessary Angel (New York: Random House, 1951), p. 142. 3 R.

CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE XV, 2</page><page sequence="2">The direction of these descriptions of a subject matter is, of course, tending toward that of the Romantic framework. But the definition which must be used in discussing Wallace Stevens as a modern Roman- tic is very specific and has reference to that of the Romantic movement (with particular emphasis on Wordsworth) by Alfred North White- head in Science and the Modern World. The Romantic movement, Whitehead says, was a reaction against the science of the age, or rather against certain modes of thought which had been precipitated by the scientific discoveries of the eighteenth century, particularly against the mechanistic universe postulated by Hobbes and others from the work of Newton, Descartes, and Bacon, and against the implications of this mechanistic universe for man. What Wordsworth found in nature, which did not receive expression in this science, was "the brooding presence of the hills."5 He perceived that the earth is a complete organ- ism and that man with all of his individual and varying perceptions is a part of this organism, which is neither mechanistic nor separate. And as a result of this conception, what has taken place, says Whitehead, is a philosophical revolution. The Romantic poet "is the prophet of a new insight into nature: he is describing things as they really are; and a revolution in the imagery of poetry is in reality a revolution in meta- physics"6 and ultimately a revolution in physics. For, as the early twentieth century discovered, the "standardized concepts of science" which are valid within very narrow limits proved too narrow for even science itself.7 If we are to place Wallace Stevens in a line descendent from Wordsworth, it is necessary to emphasize this last point. Science in the twentieth century, particularly physical science, has undergone enor- mous changes in conceptualization. It has gone far beyond the "commonsense" rational approach of the last three centuries to a highly speculative, imaginative approach which does not recognize an "impossible concept." If Wallace Stevens' subject is the earth, if he has been able to grasp the abstract implications of modern science for understanding the earth (and man as an integral component of that earth) and to portray through his poetry a new sensibility (which is still essentially Romantic), it is because he did not need to react against the scientific outlook of his day as did Wordsworth, but simply 5 Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1926), p. 112. 6 Edmund Wilson, Axel's Castle (London: Collins, 1931), p. 10. 7 Whitehead, p. 122. 222 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">react to this outlook which provides the observer, the poet, with an adequate expression of his understanding of reality. It is my feeling that in all of his work Stevens expresses a distinctively "scientific" imagination, much in the sense that Donne's poetry grows out of a spe- cific scientific world view. This viewpoint need not be taken as a con- scious reaction in the twentieth century because, says Whitehead, this quiet growth of science has practically recoloured our mentality so that modes of thought which in former times were exceptional, are now broadly spread through the educated world. . . . The new mentality is more important even than the new science and the new technology. It has altered the metaphysical presuppositions and the imaginative contents of our minds; so that now the old stimuli provoke a new response.8 In his later poems, however, particularly the volume The Rock, it seems to me that almost every poem of Stevens is an attempt to work out "a satisfactory artistic method for dealing with abstractions" with which the new science has endowed the modern world. It is by now commonplace that Wallace Stevens is a poet of ideas. According to Samuel French Morse, when asked about his intentions as a poet, he replied: "What counts, I suppose, is one's relations to contemporary ideas."9 Stevens specifies this further when in "A Collect of Philosophy," which is a discussion of what constitutes an inherently poetic idea, he finds that "the philosophy of science would lend itself better to the kind of poetry I am trying to specify."'0 The kind of poetry referred to is that which changes "a lesser life for a greater one . . . [that] probes beneath daily living" (OP, p. 189). The con- cept of relativity is surely one of the ideas which lends itself to poetry, for relativity deals essentially with perception, and poetry is an art of perception. Stevens quotes Whitehead's Science and the Modern World on space-time, when he observes that "everything is everywhere at all times, for every location involves an aspect of itself in every other loca- tion. Thus every spatio-temporal standpoint mirrors the world" (OP, p. 192). In addition, Stevens is familiar with the work (and the impli- cations of that work) of physicist Max Planck, to whom he referred as "a much truer symbol of ourselves" than, for example, Pascal. Planck's work theorized that the relation of cause to effect "exists, or 8 Ibid., p. 3. 9 Samuel F. Morse, Poetry as Life (New York: Pegasus, 1970), p. 174. 10 Wallace Stevens, Opus Posthumous (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1957), p. 195. Further references to this volume will be preceded by OP. STEVENS 1 223</page><page sequence="4">so it seems, on the human scale, only by means of an aggregate of sta- tistical compensations and as the physicists say, by virtue of macro- scopic approximations." Stevens' correspondent, Jean Paulhan, goes on to say that the great difficulty of carrying on with Planck's work is that no one has yet succeeded in imagining the "nature of corpuscular or quantic phenomena. . . . But the poets-it is possible" (OP, p. 195). Paulhan concludes: It comes to this that philosophers (particularly the philosophers of science) make, not discoveries but hypotheses that may be called poetic. Thus Louis de Broglie admits that progress in physics is, at the moment, in sus- pense because we do not have the words or the images that are essential to us. But to create illuminations, images, words, that is the very reason for being of poets. (OP, p. 196) It is for these reasons that Stevens can assert in another essay that "Modern art often seems to be an attempt to bridge the gap between fact and miracle" (OP, p. 232). The change in the conceptualization of the physical world picture which occurred early in the twentieth century can best be understood by looking first at the physical world picture as it was at the end of the nineteenth century, that world picture which Wordsworth found so dissatisfying and which had not essentially changed at the end of the century. The major assumptions of that period are succinctly formu- lated by T. H. Huxley in The Progress of Science published in 1887. The object of the physical sciences, he says, is "the discovery of the rational order which pervades the universe." Further, all physical sci- ence begins with "certain postulates. One of them is the objective exis- tence of a material world." Another postulate is "the universality of the law of causation; that nothing happens without a cause . . . and that the state of the physical universe, at any given moment, is the con- sequence of its state at any preceding moment." And finally, the last major postulate is that "any of the rules, or so-called 'laws of Nature,' by which the relation of phenomena is truly defined, is true for all time." Although Huxley admits that none of these laws is self-evident or demonstrable, yet "expectations logically based upon them are veri- fied, or, at any rate, not contradicted, whenever they can be tested by experience."" The effect of the work of modern physics has been, of course, to transcend and make contingent all three of the above postu- 11 T. H. Huxley, Selections from the Essays (New York: Appleton Century Crofts, 1948), p. 55. 224 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">lates, including the stated objective of the physical sciences. What per- vades the universe is not a "rational order" but rather a disorder, a chaos which, according to Gibbs, tended to increase as the universe grew older. The innovation which Gibbs introduced to physics was to consider not one world, but all the worlds which are possible answers to a limited set of questions concerning our environment. His cen- tral notion concerned the extent to which answers that we may give to questions about one set of worlds are probable among a larger set of worlds. Beyond this, Gibbs had a theory that this probability tended to increase as the universe grows older. The measure of this probability is called entropy, and the characteristic tendency of entropy is to increase. As entropy increases, the universe, and all closed systems in the universe, tend naturally to deteriorate and lose their distinctiveness, to move from the least probable state, from a state of organization and dif- ferentiation in which distinctions and forms exist, to a state of chaos and sameness. In Gibbs' universe order is least probable, chaos most probable. But while the universe as a whole . . . tends to run down, there are local enclaves whose direction seems opposed to that of the universe at large and in which there is a limited and temporary tendency for organization to increase. Life finds its home in some of these enclaves.12 If we accept this as the present explanation, or one partial explanation, of the universe, it appears obvious that Huxley's "Laws of Nature" will not be true for all time for all the universe, but only probably true for our "local enclave," earth, or the solar system, during a given state of development. It is with these problems of duration (time) and place (space) that Einstein's theory of relativity primarily deals. The most prominent feature of this theory is the "close connection between space and time on the one hand and causality on the other":13 Time order, the order of earlier and later, is reducible to causal order; the cause is always earlier than the effect, a relation which cannot be reversed. That Einstein's theory admits a reversal of time order for certain events, a result known from the relativity of simultaneity, is merely a consequence of this fundamental fact. Since the speed of causal transmission is limited, there exist events of such a kind that neither of them can be the cause or 12 Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings (New York: Avon, 1950), p. 20. 13 Hans Reichenbach, "The Philosophical Significance of the Theory of Relativity," Readings in the Philosophy of Science, ed. Phillip Wiener (New York: Scribners, 1953), p. 55. STEVENS 1 225</page><page sequence="6">the effect of the other. For events of this kind a time order is not defined, and either of them can be called earlier or later than the other.14 This certainly turned around Huxley's postulate that "nothing hap- pens without a cause," and it also left experimental physics in quite a dilemma. As Planck argues, "If an occurrence is causally determined if it can be predicted with certainty," and if we recognize as a firmly es- tablished fact that "it is never possible to predict a physical occurrence with unlimited precision,"15 then we are left with two alternatives. Either genuine causality does not exist in nature "but is merely an illu- sion created by the operation of certain rules which are never of an exact universal validity, even though they often come very near to it,"'6 or we can alter the basic proposition. It is the latter course that Planck (and most modern physicists) have chosen. The word "occurrence" in the above proposition is altered slightly. Thus: theoretical physics considers as an occurrence not an actual individual process of measurement-which always includes accidental and unessen- tial elements too-but a certain, merely theoretical process; and in this manner it replaces the sense world, as given to us directly by our sense organs ... by another world, the world picture of physics, which is a con- ceptual structure. . . . Consequently, every measureable physical magni- tude . . . has a double meaning, according as we regard it as directly given by some measurement, or conceive of it as translated into the world pic- ture of physics. In the first interpretation, it is never capable of a sharp definition, but in the world picture of physics it stands for a certain mathe- matical symbol which lends itself to manipulation according to quite definite, precise rules.17 Stevens' volume The Rock opens with the contemplation of "two worlds . . . The self and the earth." The world of the self is portrayed, understandably, as the subjective point of view, "your thoughts, your feelings, / Your beliefs and disbeliefs." Grammatical phrasing would seem to separate the next statement from the world of the self; and yet "the earth" is still "The redness of your reddish chestnut trees, / The river motion, the drowsy motion of the river R."'1 What began appar- 14 Ibid., p. 69. 15 Max Planck, "The Concept of Causality in Physics," Readings in the Philosophy of Science, p. 77. 16 Ibid., p. 78. 17 Ibid., p. 79. 18 Wallace Stevens, Collected Poems (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1969), p. 501. Further references to this volume will be preceded by CP. 226 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">rently as a statement about the subjective world of individual per- ception and the "objective existence of a material world" (in T. H. Huxley's phrase) has slid away from that misleading dichotomy. The redness of the chestnut tree is not a matter of objective verification; it is your sense of the reddish tree. The representation in the poem comes at the very end in the single letter R. "R" is an unassigned symbol in mathematics which in this poem will take the essence of redness and of river from the subjective world of the observer-poet into the physical world picture where "it lends itself to manipulation according to quite definite, precise rules."'9 In other poems this symbol will become the icon R of the rock, the R of another river which is ... the third commonness with light and air, A curriculum, a vigor, a local abstraction ... Call it, once more, a river, an unnamed flowing, Space-filled.... (CP, p. 533) And finally R is the representation of reality itself, which is the last word in the volume. In this first poem Stevens asks no questions about the two different worlds he represents; that will come later in the vol- ume. Likewise, he does not even speculate about the relative value of the two worlds; the poem is merely a statement in which Stevens begins to embody a new way of thinking about old problems. A much more complicated formulation of a slightly different nature comes in the next poem, "The Irish Cliffs of Moher." In the essay on "The Philosophical Significance of the Theory of Relativity," from which I quoted extensively earlier, the author is discussing the "features" of space and time in the physical world and asserts that "space and time have as much reality as, say, the relation 'father' or the Newtonian forces of attraction."2" It is, I suppose, a coincidence that Stevens begins his poem, which is, I believe, an attempt to specify some very abstract concepts about space and time, with the question, "Who is my father in this world, in this house, / At the spirit's base?" (CP, p. 501). The question is one of relativity, in both the personal and the universal sense. To ask "Who is my father?" is to attempt to deter- mine causality. But if "time is the order of causal chains" only in the arbitrary world picture of physics,21 then to determine ultimate cause one must look back to "My father's father, his father's father . . . / 19 Planck, p. 79. 20 Reichenbach, p. 68. 21 Ibid., p. 71. STEVENS i 227</page><page sequence="8">Go back to a parent before thought" (CP, p. 501). Ultimately one must extract oneself from consideration of the reality and ". .. go to the cliffs of Moher rising out of the mist, / Above the real, / Ris- ing out of the present time and place . . ." (CP, pp. 501-502) to a theoretical horizon ("This is not landscape") wherein one can con- template a single event, which, as its hypothetical aspects become real- ized, begins to assert a pattern. It is this prototypical pattern that "is my father, or maybe, / It is as he was." Having "discovered" the pat- tern of this event, the speaker descends and finds the answer to his first question in the likeness "of the race of fathers: earth / And sea and air." He has discovered an order, just as the Canon Aspirin discovered the order of the seasons, but this order has been apprehended (in con- trast to the Canon who was known "not to have reasoned at all" [CP, p. 404]) through the logical process of question and discovery. Both are valid. The mind-world (theoretical-experiential) relationship is only falsely conceived when a man imagines that his will is capable of dominating rather than discovering reality, as when "The President ordains the bee to be / Immortal" (CP, p. 390) in a fallacious and futile metaphysical exercise. Frank Doggett in Stevens' Poetry of Thought has observed that in his middle years, Stevens wrote a poem, "The Reader," concerned with the "principle of the descent of heat to cold and the degeneration of energy and matter,"22 that is, about the second law of thermody- namics. The reader in the poem is reading his book of nature ("Sat reading as if in a book" [CP, p. 146] ) where he sees the pattern of the degeneration of matter in the changes around him: the season chang- ing to winter from autumn, the lamp burnt out, and the melons and pears "shrivelled." The reader sees that "Everything / Falls back to coldness" and the only writing left in the book of nature is "the trace of burning stars / In the frosty heaven" (CP, p. 147). In the final heat death of the universe, all molecular energy, and therefore all change, will be halted, as molecules themselves become hardened crystals at 0 temperature. In "The Plain Sense of Things," the third poem in The Rock, Stevens develops this description of the de-creation of the material world. The setting here too is "After the leaves have fallen," and the observer sees evidences of the heat death in his surroundings, which seem to him "as if / We had come to an end of the imagination" (CP, 22 Frank Doggett, Stevens' Poetry of Thought (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1966), p. 71. 228 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">p. 502). The cold is "blank," the structure of the world has "become a minor house," a greenhouse, in fact, which "never so badly needed paint." As he gazes at the pattern before him, he realizes that "A fan- tastic effort has failed" and he deduces this from the "repetitiousness of men and flies" (CP, p. 502), that is, from the repetitious pattern of degenerations. He has come to the realization that "sooner or later we shall die, and it is highly probable that the whole universe around us will die the heat death, in which the world shall be reduced to one vast temperature equilibrium in which nothing really new ever happens. There will be nothing left but a drab uniformity out of which we can expect only minor and insignificant local fluctuations."23 This time, however, the reader of the book is aware that even this "absence of the imagination had / Itself to be imagined" (CP, p. 503). That is not to say that the simple fact of imagining the heat death of the universe will make it happen, but that the fact of its hypothesis is one of the great accomplishments of human imagination. The same theme repeats itself almost immediately in "Lebens- weisheitspielerei" where, as the heat death proceeds, only the "unac- complished" are left to witness it. One assumes that they are "unac- complished" in Whitehead's sense of the meaning which I used earlier: that "an event in realising itself displays a pattern .... The actuality of the space-time systems is constituted by the realisation of pattern." In this instance their failure to complete the pattern is caused by the fulfillment of the larger pattern which annihilates all other patterns: Their indigence is an indigence That is an indigence of the light, A stellar pallor that hangs on the threads. (CP, p. 505) On another level each of these poems is, of course, also a personal comment on advancing old age and approaching death. The poet sees his own disintegration and the cosmic implications of it, but at the same time he still looks for that momentary exception to the larger disorder, one of those "local enclaves whose direction seems opposed to that of the universe at large and in which there is a limited and tem- porary tendency for organization to increase."24 The poem itself stands for or becomes one of these enclaves in the poetic universe and makes life possible: 23 Norbert Wiener, p. 45. 24 Ibid., p. 20. STEVENS 229</page><page sequence="10">There it was, word for word, The poem that took the place of a mountain. He breathed its oxygen ... It reminded him how he had needed A place to go to in his own direction ... (CP, p. 512) The poet arranges the pattern, creates the order, which results in his "unexplained completion." The same effect occurs in the "Final Solilo- quy of the Interior Paramour." In the darkness and chaos of the disin- tegrating universe, "Out of all the indifferences," the light of the poet's imagination creates that small enclave, "a single shawl / Wrapped tightly round us" (CP, p. 524). The light is a "miraculous influence" primarily because it creates order, which is according to the physical world picture statistically improbable. Here, too, Stevens asks the question which so fascinated the physicist Planck in his last years, and this concern may account for the similarity Stevens finds between him- self and this man, who is "a truer symbol of ourselves" (OP, p. 195). The determinist Planck, who had to postulate a mathematical universe in order for the bond of causality to be valid, was not in the end entirely satisfied with this solution: For, in the end, a universal principle like the rigorous causal bond between two successive events ought to be independent of man. It is a principle of cosmic importance, it ought to be absolute. Now, Planck not only recog- nizes that it is part of human aptitude to foresee events but to foresee them by means of science, "the provisional and changing creation of the power of the imagination." How then liberate the concept from such an anthropomorphic hypothesis? Only an intelligence external to man, "not constituting a part of nature," would be able to liberate it. This supra- natural intelligence would act through the deterministic power. .. . Planck thereupon concludes that the law of causality is neither true nor false. It is a working hypothesis. (OP, p. 202) So Stevens asks in the "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour" whether or not there was an intelligence, "A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous." Is there a "central mind" out of which all created order flows? An answer is not given in the poem, which offers only an hypothesis. The resolution is, instead, that the contemplation of the order, the "dwelling in the evening air, / . . . is enough" (CP, p. 524). 230 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">Stevens returns to this question in two sequential poems, "Look- ing Across the Fields and Watching the Birds Fly" and "Song of Fixed Accord." In the first he humorously catalogs "the more irritating minor ideas / Of Mr. Homburg during his visits home." One of these habits is to "think away the grass, the trees, the clouds," until the poet is led to speculate in one of his "qualified assertions": ... there may be A pensive nature, a mechanical And slightly detestable operandum, free From man's ghost, larger and yet a little like, ... (CP, pp. 517-18) Yet if that is true, then Stevens finds himself facing much the same dilemma that Wordsworth confronted in the nineteenth-century mech- anistic universe. What is the place of the mind and imagination if "The spirit comes from the body of the world?" The answer is that this type of universe's "blunt laws make an affectation of mind" (CP, p. 519). In "Song of Fixed Accord" the dove sits on her nest and accepts each hour of the sun as ordinary, inevitable, and "Not subject to change. ..." She does not question what is the "Day's invisible beginner" (CP, p. 520). The implied consideration here is that what is desirable for the dove is only partly satisfying for a self-conscious entity. Several of the poems in The Rock deal with the notion that in the theoretical world of physics there is no longer an "impossible con- cept"; science no longer claims to deal with what will always happen, but with what will probably happen. In "Prologues to What is Pos- sible" Stevens takes his persona from the limited world as we know it where boats float and are moved with oars, to another plane where we can consider "all worlds which are possible answers to a limited set of questions concerning our environment."25 On this theoretical plane "The boat was built of stones that had lost their weight and being no longer heavy / Had left in them only a brilliance, of unaccustomed origin" (CP, p. 515). As he moves forward into this universe the per- sona becomes fused with the boat. "He belonged to the far-foreign departure of his vessel and was part of it" (CP, p. 516). The man/ boat, as it enters the theoretical framework, becomes a symbol ("what- ever it was") just as "redness" and "river" in "An Old Man Asleep" become represented in the symbol R, capable of being manipulated in 25 Ibid. STEVENS 231</page><page sequence="12">the universe of the "possible." The intention of the search, the entrance into the new framework, is to find an ultimate meaning, "the meaning into which he wanted to enter" (CP, p. 516). When he finds this meaning, it will separate him completely from the outer essence that now surrounds and identifies him. The contemplation of this state frightens the persona, for he would be moving into an unknown uni- verse, perhaps one in which the laws and phenomena of our own universe are entirely dissimilar, for according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics we know that disorder is not only possible, but probable. The persona knows that the pattern of traits which are a "likeness of him extended / Only a little way, and not beyond" (CP, p. 516), unless somewhere in all of the possible universes there is another "improbable" enclave ("enclosures of hypotheses") where organization persists, patterns are recognizable, and life exists. The shift in universe, or in perspective, is frightening also because the smallest change in the causal space-time continuum may have much larger far-reaching effects: The way the earliest single light in the evening sky, in spring, Creates a fresh universe out of nothingness by adding itself, The way a look or touch reveals its unexpected magnitudes. (CP, p. 517) The question not asked, but seems to me implied, is whether imagin- ing the new perspective is enough to make it real; if in asking, "What self, for example, did he contain that had not yet been loosed," that slight shift in perspective is enough to send the new self "Snarling in him for discovery as his attentions spread" (CP, p. 516). An earlier poem in the volume, "Madame La Fleurie," reads almost like an elegy for the persona who enters the theoretical universe in "Prologues to What is Possible." He has obviously become the pure essence of the symbol, unencumbered by the outer essence of the "boat," for the reader is admonished to "Weight him down .. .": Seal him there. He looked in a glass of the earth and thought he lived in it. Now, he brings all that he saw into the earth, to the waiting parent. His crisp knowledge is devoured by her, beneath a dew. (CP, p. 507) All of the man's wandering in the intellectual theoretical sphere returns to this actual earth where his knowledge is absorbed by the parent figure (both male and female, a "bearded queen") found ear- lier in "The Irish Cliffs of Moher," the prototypical pattern fulfilling 232 [ CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">itself at the same time that it absorbs its child. The theoretical sphere in which he searched is not, in this poem, one in which man should spend his life. It was created only "because he looked in it," and rather than being the quiet point of "central arrival" from "Prologues to What is Possible," it is "a page he had found in the handbook of heartbreak" (CP, p. 507). This is not a rejection of the theoretical in favor of the experiential universe; the final turn of the poem is, rather, ambivalent. The theoretician lies in his tomb, not reconciled to the pattern he has so belatedly "discovered" but in grief, . .. that his mother should feed on him, himself and what he saw, In that distant chamber, a bearded queen, wicked in her dead light. (CP, p. 507) The undeniable expression of horror in the last stanza sounds very similar to the emotion Stevens expressed in answer to a question about the role of the poet in modern society. The poet's role, he felt, had to be more than a private role: If people are to become dependent on poetry for any of the fundamen- tal satisfactions, poetry must have an increasingly intellectual scope and power. This is a time for the highest poetry. We never understood the world less than we do now nor, as we understand it, like it less. We never wanted to understand it more or needed to like it more. These are the intense compulsions that challenge the poet as the appreciatory creator of values and beliefs. That, finally, states the problem.26 But it does not answer the problem, and the likelihood is that the theoretician of "Madame La Fleurie" reading the "handbook of heart- break" is the same persona as the poet, the "creator of values and beliefs," and similarly the same persona as the meditator in "Old Phi- losopher in Rome" who finds "The extreme of the known in the pres- ence of the extreme / Of the unknown" (CP, p. 508). The philoso- pher (theologian), the poet, and the scientist all live in two worlds, or at least recognize . . .grandeur that you need In so much misery; and yet finding it 26 Morse, p. 179. STEVENS 233</page><page sequence="14">Only in misery, the afflatus of ruin, Profound poetry of the poor and of the dead,... (CP, p. 509) To find the creative impulse, one's inspiration, in the imagination of ruin, destruction, and chaos, is perhaps to understand the world better, but is certainly also to "like it less." "A Quiet Normal Life" is therefore a statement in favor of the immediate apprehension of the immediate universe, no matter what its limitation may be. Man's place "was not / In anything that he con- structed," especially not in those theoretical ends of the universe ... in which, like snow, He became an inhabitant, obedient To gallant notions on the part of cold. (CP, p. 523) Rather, his place is in the here and now of his warm house, the familiar chair, the small enclaves of organization, where There was no fury in transcendent forms. But his actual candle blazed with artifice. (CP, p. 523) This is not the final word in the debate, however, for the next poem in the volume is "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour" in which the poem, the creation of the imagination, sheds the same light and warmth as the "actual candle." The poem "The Rock" continues the debate in quite a different perspective. The first section, "Seventy Years Later," opens by stating that "It is an illusion that we were ever alive" (CP, p. 525). It carries the reasoning of Planck's indeterminists to its logical extreme. If cau- sality does not exist in nature "but is merely an illusion created by the operation of certain rules which are never of an exact universal valid- ity,"27 then it is doubtful that we "Lived in the houses of mothers, arranged ourselves / By our own motions in a freedom of air" (CP, p. 525). And yet the "houses still stand, / . . . in rigid emptiness" to reduce this kind of an argument to a logical absurdity which "is not to be believed." The argument is an invention on the part of man to contain that instant when edges of the outer chaos touch the edges of the organized enclave. The image Stevens uses to express this is famil- iar from Thoreau's Walden, where he describes wilderness coming down to the edge of his cultivated field, in a meeting of chaos and organization: 27 Planck, p. 78. 234 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="15">The meeting at noon at the edge of the field seems like An invention, an embrace between one desperate clod And another in a fantastic consciousness, In a queer assertion of humanity: (CP, p. 525) The poet proposes a theorem to account for the existence of two such disparate figures. He creates a rock (R) to represent "nothingness," a "permanent cold." This rock, however, contains a "metier," an illu- sion of order, of suspended entropy, which it so desires that by the very power of this desire "the green leaves came and covered the high rock" (CP, p. 526). This is, of course, once again the poet's description of Gibbs's exception to the general rule of entropy increasing, the moti- vation or "cause" whereby "there is a limited and temporary tendency for order to increase."28 In section 2, "The Poem as Icon," the poet continues the above theme but asserts that the theorem he has proposed is not enough for mankind. The human being himself "must be cured" of the disorder that is within him. The cure is one which Wordsworth would have understood: We must be cured of it by a cure of the ground . . the leaves, if they broke into bud, If they broke into bloom, if they bore fruit, And if we ate the incipient colorings Of their fresh culls might be a cure of the ground. (CP, p. 526) The human being is part of the larger organism of nature and Stevens, as Whitehead said of Wordsworth, "grasps the whole of nature as involved in the tonality of the particular instance."29 But for Stevens the poem also can be part of the cure, for "the fiction of the leaves is the icon / Of the poem" (CP, p. 526). Spring, summer, and autumn are the leaves that cover the winter of the Rock and "These leaves are the poem, the icon and the man" (CP, p. 527). And if there is nothing else, if there is no supranatural intelligence which constitutes nature by an act of will, then the poem must become more than just the leaves: 28 Norbert Wiener, p. 19. 29 Whitehead, p. 121. STEVENS 235</page><page sequence="16">New senses in the engenderings of sense, The desire to be at the end of distances, The body quickened and the mind in root. They bloom as a man loves, as he lives in love. (CP, p. 527) In other words, the poem "makes meanings of the rock," of the final ultimate theoretical reality. In the third section, "Forms of the Rock in a Night-Hymn," we are given several of the possible variations of the symbol R as it appears in the universe. The rock is the source of life, "The stone from which he rises," and at the same time "The step to the bleaker depths of his descents . . ." (CP, p. 528). It is many things, but ultimately, "The rock is the habitation of the whole." The rock is the universe in its infinity, that immeasurable infinity which makes events relative and unpredictable. Points A and B are points of perspective in this infinity, but from neither of them can the center or purpose of creation be deter- mined. This is only "adduced" from the rock itself, R, reality, that essence which is "The starting point of the human and the end, / That in which space itself is contained . . ." (CP, p. 528). How can a poem make a meaning of something so vague, so difficultly expressed? Only by singing "Night's hymn of the rock, as in a vivid sleep" (CP, p. 528). Or, as in "Note on Moonlight," the poet fulfills the purpose of the universe just by seeing it: It is as if being was to be observed, As if, among the possible purposes Of what one sees, the purpose that comes first, The surface, is the purpose to be seen. (CP, p. 531) So that in the poem which follows, when "Ariel was glad he had written his poems" (CP, p. 532), his hope for them is not a small one: ... they should bear Some lineament or character, Some affluence, if only half-perceived, In the poverty of their words, Of the planet of which they were part. (CP, pp. 532-33) If he has succeeded, he has in one sense fulfilled himself and the larger pattern of the universe. To describe or illuminate the universe is, after all, the greater part of the task of not only the poet, but the philoso- 236 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="17">pher and scientist also. And to say, as Stevens does at the end of this volume, that "It was like / A new knowledge of reality" (CP, p. 534), is to say a great deal. Forty years after Huxley's first call for a poetry that had "worked out a satisfactory method for dealing with abstractions" he observed that "science sometimes builds new bridges between universes of dis- course and experience hitherto regarded as separate and heterogene- ous."30 The poetry of Wallace Stevens, particularly in The Rock, has illustrated this and, in so doing, has expanded the definition of what constitutes an inherently poetic idea. He has also created a framework within which a poetic discussion of the nature of life is possible and meaningful, in much the same manner that T. S. Eliot placed such a discussion within a religious framework and Yeats a mythic one. Hux- ley would maintain that Stevens' viewpoint is the one that is necessary to the modern world, for "in an age of science the world can no longer be looked at as a set of symbols. Alles Vergaengliche ist NICHT ein Gleichnis. The world is poetical intrinsically and what it means is simply itself. Its significance is the enormous mystery of its existence and of our awareness of that existence."31 Middlebury College 30 Aldous Huxley, Literature and Science (New York: Harper and Row, 1963), p. 111. 31 Ibid.
