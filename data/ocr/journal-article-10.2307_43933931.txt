<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOVE AMONG THE ROSES VII. 38 By Julianus Prefect or Egypt Translated by Dorothy Belle Pollack Bronx Community College While weaving a garland One fine day, I found that, midst The roses, lay The God of Love; I picked him up, And dipped him in The wine-filled cup. 1 took and drank him; Now he clings Inside me, tickling With his wings! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ The transitions between the old images (HE and SHE) and modern abstractions (IT) can be found to a great extent by approaching what is still pictorial in our own language. Our way of speaking can never grow as individualistic as can our way of thinking. It will always stay "tribal," since it is used to express what the members of the same "tribe" have in common. It is, therefore, filled with imaginative expressions, which are vestiges of medieval thinking. Only a few examples can be given here. We still talk about motions in inanimate things as if they were the actions of living beings. We say. "The sun rises," "the lightning hits," "the stone rolls," "the wheel turns/' "the motor runs," "the clock ticks," "the engine (she!) dies," etc... This is not animism, or anthropomorphism, i.e., attribution of human qualities to other beings, done ages ago, for reasons of their own, by people who are supposed to have thought our abstract thoughts in a so-called "primitive" way. On the contrary &gt; it is a remnant of medieval habits of thinking, viz., thinking in pictures, i.e., in beings. We still name parts of our environment, of mountains and roads, etc., after parts of our body. We do the same with parts of clothing, utensils and furniture. These two examples can help us to find guidelines for the interpretation of myths in such realms of our own language. We can also find a most important set of imaginative expressions in old proverbial sayings which contain the names of members of the family; expressions such as: "Necessity is the Mother of Invention" or "The Wish is the Father of the Thought" or "Truth is the Daughter of Time." These clearly express in a pictorial way what in abstract thinking would be termed "causes and effects." Many folktales as well as myths, show such family relations as an impor- tant part of their structure. A study of expressions with the words father , mother and child is therefore revealing. In many languages we find the concept "fatherland," i.e., "land of our fathers," and the expression, "to be gathered to one's fathers." They show that the father-figure indicates our forefathers, ancestry, heredity and fam- ily traditions. We should not forget that our father gave us his name, the same he received from his father. The word "mother tongue" shows the idea, mother, as the image of our tribal envi- ronment, where our native language be- longs, our family life and style, and our present circumstances. Our child, of course, depicts our future, since it is our reproduction, our renewed self. In addition, there is a distinction in the pictorial value of a daughter and a son. One can see this clearly in such tales as "Little Brother and Sister," and less obviously in "Hansel and Gretei." Our emotional life in its development is de- picted as our daughter. Our son is the image of the core of our being directly connected with our power of will. On his way to maturity, often in a con- cealed manner depicted as an initiation, the hero first has to separate himself from his family traditions, i.e., his</page><page sequence="2">Page 60 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK lather. The terrifying loneliness whieh then ensues often makes him foster his eonneetions with his tribal indentity, depieted as hos nother. The well - known Oedipus - myth shows this with great clarity. We can also see it enacted around us in daily life. We ean observe 'iow immigrants, who as individuals have left their fatherland and all its traditions, often do not want to give up their mother tongue , their ethnic iden- tity. They leave it to their children to speak the new language, and to take their parents' place in the country of the future. On his journey the hero has to pass trials in which he overcomes wild animals, giants and monsters, that is, his animality and his untamed instincts, until he is purified, and worthy to unite himself with his spiritual counterpart, e.g., with Penelope. These are basic sequences. There are, of course, many more images to interpret. In studying the value of emblems and pictures as depictions of self development, we shall discover that human beings, such as goldsmiths, hunters, shoemakers, tailors, millers, and other professionals, depict what is conscious in us and connected with our thinking; while animals appear to be pictures of our unconscious instincts. We seem to meet them outside in our forest; but actually they are in us, and show certain of our qualities: aggresion, cruelty, greed, egotism, etc., as in a mirror. It is possible to solve the riddles of a great number of fairytales in this man- ner, just as most elements in the Greek myths readily show their meaning to us. This way of studying myths and folktales, viz. as picture sequences showing human development, brings new life to Carl Jung's theories, and is based on ideas of Rudolf Steiner. ★ ★ ★ ★ ★</page></plain_text>
