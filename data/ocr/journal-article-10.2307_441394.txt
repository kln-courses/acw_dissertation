AESTHETICS Mathers, Peter W., trans., "Barthes on Theater," Theatre Quarterly, 9, No. 33:25-30, Spring 1979. Two articles by Barthes, first published in 1956 and 1963, indicate "the relevance of his aesthetic theory to the study and analysis of theatre in the English-speaking world." (M.L.) AGNON, SAMUEL Landau, Lewis, "Mekorot vepsevdo- mekorot bavehaya heakov lemishor' leShay Agnon" ("Sources and Pseudo- sources in 'The Crooked Shall Be Made Straight' by S. Agnon"), Hasifrut, 26:94- 103, April 1978. Agnon's story fills out the characters of folk narrative and adds realistic detail. How- ever, critics have called these unassimilated, especially Agnon's inserted Hasidic story. On the contrary, the story's strength is its integration of tradition. (A_W.) ALBERTI, RAFAEL Sarria, F. G., "Sobre los tingeles de Rafael Alberti y el surrealismo," Papeles de Son Armadans, 271-72-73:23-40, Oct., Nov., Dec. 1978. The profound alteration of language in this work leads to a profoundly altered vision of the world that permits us to glance for an instant at that vision of the surreal in which logical contradictions seem abolished. (M.M.R.) Serrano-Plaja, Arturo, "Sobre Marinero en tierra y un poco mis," Papees de Son Armadans, 269-70:105-27, Aug., Sept. 1978. The deliberate lack of focus of the sailor who is out of his element, water, can sug- gest not ridicule, but ludicrousness. (M.M.R.) ALDINGTON, RICHARD Gates, Norman T., "Images of War and Death of a Hero: Aldington's Twice-Used Im- ages," Modern British Literature, 4:120-7, Fall 1979. Aldington's war poems and first novel show similarities, especially in their "sharp im- ages and details of trench life." (J.S.) ALONSO, DAMASO Perez Firmat, Gustavo, "Cosmology and the Poem: Damaso Alonso's 'Suerio de las dos ciervas'," Hispanic Review, 46:147-71, Spring 1978. Alonso's poem comprises "un jeu d'inter- textualite" with Juan de la Cruz's poem, "La fonte," whose imagery and stanza form it parallels. But the faith that sustains San Juan's seeker is impossible for Alonso's modern "durmiente," who belongs to "the 348</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY exploding universe of Big-Bang theories" and "is doomed to incompleteness." (N.A.N.) AMERICAN LITERATURE Oehlschlaeger, Fritz H., "Hamlin Garland and the Pulitzer Prize Controversy of 1921," American Literature, 51:409-14, Nov. 1979. Sinclair Lewis's loss of the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 1921 was not the result of an arbitrary rejection of the jury's recom- mendation. Hamlin Garland reported on Main Street in a way that "could hardly be called a recommendation at all." (W.G.F.) AQUIN, HUBERT LaBossiire, Camille, "Hubert Aquin's Rev- olutionary Commedia Dellarte of Hell: A Baroque Impasse," Mosaic, 11:119-25, No. 3, 1978. "In the ironic speculum of the metaphysical Quebecois gamester staging plays within plays, the disjunction between revelation and damnation is both weak and strong." (K.G.K.) ARABIC POETRY Khayyat, Shimon, "Bayat Levanon bashira haaravit hekhadasha" ("The Problem of Lebanon in Modern Arabic Poetry"), Bitzaron, 48:314-6, March-April 1978. Arabic poetry by American Lebanese, signaled by the name of Suleiman Daoud, blames the catastrophe in the "homeland" on the "treason" of leaders like Arafat and laments the hard fact of uprooting from the "land of the fathers." (A.W.) ASIMOV, ISAAC Hark, Ina Rae, "Unity in the Composite Novel: Triadic Patterning in Asimov's The Gods Themselves," Science-Fiction Studies, 6:281-6, Nov. 1979. "The book is schizophrenic, a 'Golden Age' story with a New Wave center; and it is the first of Asimov's composites to jump from place to place ... without making corre- sponding leaps in time." (M.S.B.) Wilson, Raymond J., "Asimov's Mystery Story Structure," Extrapolation, 19:101-7, May 1978. "Both Leo Tolstoy and Isaac Asimov portray the significance of human decisions and actions on a broad canvas." (M.S.B.) ATWOOD, MARGARET Colman, S. J., "Margaret Atwood, Lucien Goldmann's Pascal, and the Meaning of 'Canada'," University of Toronto Quarterly, 48:245-62, Spring 1979. In Survival and Surfacing Atwood expresses the tragic world-view Goldmann attributes to Pascal. It characterizes a whole "group of Canadian intellectuals and publicists who write or speak ... as though Canadian nationhood had been achieved." (J.S.) AUDEN, W. H. Roth, Marc A., "The Sound of a Poet Sing- ing Loudly: A Look at Elegy for Young Lovers," Comparative Drama, 13:99-120, Summer 1979. Auden's operatic collaborations have been neglected by critics, although "especially in the case of Elegy for Young Lovers" Auden and the German composer Hans Werner Henze achieved "a unique international collaboration which ... has become a highly significant work in the contemporary musi- cal theatre." (D.P.) Rowe, Margaret Moan, "Travels With a Poet: W. H. Auden in Iceland and China," Modern British Literature, 4:128-36, Fall 1979. "Auden's desire to entertain dominates Let- ters from Iceland, while in Journey to a War entertainment is dramatically decreased as Auden mounts the pulpit in desperate ef- fort to sound the warning cry before the cataclysm of World War II." (J.S.) BALDWIN, JAMES Bigsby, C. W. E., "The Divided Mind of James Baldwin," Journal of American Studies, 13, No. 3:325-42, Dec. 1979. A survey of Baldwin's novels shows us a writer whose "career has described a neat and telling parabola and whose contradic- tions go to the heart of an issue [black/white relations] which dominated the political and cultural life of mid-century America." (M.L.) BALINT, TIBOR Bertha, Zoltan, "Balint Tibor," Alf6d, 30:69-76, Aug. 1979.

Jurgis Baltrusaitis took an active part in the Russian symbolist movement. In both his Lithuanian and Russian verse there is a dominant line of what may be called "con- ceptual imagery." In his Russian verse Bal- trusaitis' words meaning different specific things retain their identity, but are organ- ized around a single semantic axis projected upon his special concept of timelessness, of "another world." His Lithuanian "poetry" appears to be richer and more fascinating in its complex interplay of language level than his Russian verse. (V.D.) BAROJA, Pfo Tatum, Charles M., "El anarquismo de Baroja," Hispanofila, 64:31-41, Sept. 1978. Baroja's anarchism was "... a critical and revolutionary attitude toward society, aimed at the destruction of false values through his literary works, using ideas in place of bombs..." (M.M.R.) BARRIOS, EDUARDO Walker, John, "The Aesthetic and Metaphysical Function of Liturgy in the Work of Eduardo Barrios," Mosaic, 12:147-59, No. 2, 1979. "For Barrios, the liturgy is a means of at- tempting to render artistically matters of the Heart (faith, sentiment, instinct) which are not only the stuff, but also the cause, of the metaphysical realities that beset his tor- mented characters in particular ... and all men in general in their daily struggle with existence." (K.G.K.) BARTHES, ROLAND Ulmer, Gregory L., "Fetishism in Roland Barthes's Nietzschean Phase," Papers on Language &amp; Literature, 14:334-55, Sum- mer 1978. Barthes's writings manifest all the features of fetishism, but use Nietzsche's methods of genealogy and the gay science to turn per- version into "critical production." (G.S.S.) BELLI, CARLOS GERMAN Lasarte, F., "Pastoral and Counter-Pastoral: The Dynamics of Belli's Poetic Despair," MLN, 94:301-20, March 1979. "Belli's use of pastoral language and motifs is ironic and lends a skeptical dimension to [the theme of] his social protest."(M.M.R.) BELLOW, SAUL Chaukin, Allan, "Bellow's Alternative to the Waste Land: Romantic Theme and Form in Herog," Studies in te Novel, 11:326-37, Fall 1979. "In Herzog, Bellow speculates upon the rel- evance of romanticism to modern life. It is this concern that determines the theme and form of the novel. .." (R.B.) BELY, ANDREY Kellman, Steven G., "Circles, Squares, and the Mind's Ear in St. Petersburg," Papers on Language &amp; Literature, 14:464-9, Fall 1978. Andrey Bely's comic story progresses as a "dialectic between circle and square," proving the superiority of visual orientation to oral/aural consciousness in post- Gutenberg civilization. (G.S.S.) BENOIT, JACQUES Sugden, Leonard W., "Man as Monster, Dog and Prince: A Critique of Les Voleurs by Jacques Benoit," Mosaic, 11:153-63, No. 3, 1978. Les Voleurs presents a "slow inversion of the social hierarchy. . . . Physical power and sexual prowess ... fuse as the chief means human beings possess for maintaining their ascendancy over one another." (K.G.K.) BERGAMiN, JOSE Dennis, Nigel, "Jose Bergamin: Ilustraci6n y defensa de la frivolidad," Cuadenos Hispanoamericanos, 342:603-13, Dec. 1978. Bergamin is not a "hunter," but rather a "liberator" of ideas. The spontaneity and unexpected quality of his works "... stem from a profound respect and admiration for the surprising mobility and the volatile nature of ideas." (M.M.R.) 350</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY BERKESI, ANDRAS Kiss, Valeria G., "Egy nepszeri ir6," Alfold, 28:60-6, Aug, 1977. The novels of Berkesi reveal his ability as a writer who successfully satisfies popular demand. The responsibilities of an author, however, are greater. He should strive to create an art where the socio-political milieu does not fade into meaningless scen- ery, and the problems of the characters are solved by ethical and ideological insight in- stead of shallow bourgeois mentality. (1.O.) BLACK AFRICAN LITERATURE Lindfors, Berth, "Politics, Culture and Lit- erary Form in Black Africa," Colby Library Quarterly, 15:240-51, Dec. 1979. Postwar Black writers from West and East Africa have increasingly addressed their own people as colonialism has faded. In contrast, exiled South Africans have turned outward to tell of "repeated repression at home." (J.S.) BORGES, JORGE LUIS Hughes, Psiche, "The Concept of Suicide in Borges' Stories in Relation to the Themes of Destiny and Aggression," Hispan6fila, 67:61-71, Sept. 1979. "The absence of suicide in the stories of Borges is only apparent. In fact, the two main themes of predetermined destiny and of aggression which run through most of his stories ... present the hypothesis of man, contemplating, actually willing his own death." (M.M.R.) Magris, Claudio, "Borges y su Nueva An- tologia Personal," Papeles de Son Armadans. 271-72-73:5-21, Oct., Nov., Dec. 1978. This new personal anthology is of inferior quality compared with that published a few years ago. It includes too many lyrical com- positions, and leaves out some of Borges's masterpieces (El Aleph, El Sur, Funes, El muerto, etc.). (M.M.R.) Pollmann, Leo, "El espantoso redentor. La Poetica inmanente de Historia universal de la infamia," Revista Iberoamericana, 45:459-73, June-Sept. 1979. Borges' earliest narrative pieces in A Uni- versal History of Infamy already manifest the Borgesian view of fiction as a paradox, a stylistic confidence game that is also a ques- tioning of the unanswerable problem of the universe. (P.K.S.) BORUTA, KAZYS gilbajoris, Rimvydas, "Ristybes Sviesa Kazio Borutos poezij'oje," Metmenys, 37:5-22, 1979. The basic tenet of Boruta's poetry is truth, and as a consequence he rejected the ele- ments of deceit. He effectively uses dif- ferent poetic devices such as internal rhymes, various associations between sound and meaning. Some of his poetry is close to the left of the late twenties and thirties where Boruta's anger and sharp conflicts are similar to those of Garcia Lorca. (V.D.) BOYD, MARTIN Moon, Kenneth, "Pulp Writing and Coinci- dences in Martin Boyd's Lucinda Brayford," Southerly, 2:183-93, June 1978. Despite "the uneven quality of Boyd's in- ventiveness and general expression," Lucinda Brayford succeeds by dint of "an amplitude and depth of characterization. ... It also has ... the tragic vision of quick bright things come to confusion." (S.T.) BRECHT, BERTOLT Kitching, Laurence P. A., "Bertolt Brecht's Collaboration with Hella Wuolijoki on Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti: The Contradiction as Structural Principle," Journal of Baltic Studies, 10:361-8, Winter 1979. In the collected works, the play Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti is published under the authorship of Brecht, with a note "ge- schrieben nach den Erzihlungen und einem Stuckentwurf von Hella Wuolijoki."Tlhis note fairly accurately indicates the truth of the matter since Brecht made extensive thematic and stylistic changes. (V.D.) BRINES, FRANCISCO Villena, Luis Antonio de, "Sobre Insistencias e Luzbel y la poesia de Francisco Brines," Papeles de Son Armadans, 267:213-22, June 1978. In this book Brines passes from the experi- ence of the body to that of the mind, and turns into a metaphysical poet. (M.M.R.) BROCH, HERMANN Kiss, Endre, "Zur Theorie und Praxis des modernen Romans-uiber Hermann Brochs Der Tod des Vergil," Neophilologus, 62:279-89, April 1978. Broch and the young Lukacs held similar 351</page><page sequence="5">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE positions "concerning certain philosophical and theoretical problems." (J.R.R.) BRUNNER, JOHN Goldman, Stephen H., "John Brunner's Dystopias: Heroic Man In Unheroic So- ciety," Science Fiction Studies, 5:260-70, Nov. 1978. "The optimism of a manifest destiny is not part of the world that Brunner creates. In- stead, Brunner is far more likely to ques- tion the future and man's place in it." (M.S.B.) BUERO VALLEJO, ANTONIO Podol, Peter L., "The Theme of Honor in Two Plays of Buero Vallejo: Las palabras en la arena and La tejedora de sueios," His- panofila, 68:39-46, Jan. 1980. "Buero Vallejo's equation of traditional honor and its requisite vengeance with tyranny, hypocrisy and the negation of the true Christian spirit places his theatre at the end of a long line of plays ... which move ... toward the rejection of the ... code which governed the 'comedia.'" (M.M.R.) BUNIN, IVAN Marcello, Thomas Gaiton, "Bunin's Dry Valley: The Russian Novel in Transition from Realism to Modernism," Forum for Modern Language Studies, 14:193-207, July 1978. The novel Dry Valley "can be said to repre- sent Bunin's weariness with the steadily de- clining tradition of the Russian novel, and his apparent willingness to explore new aesthetic frontiers." (J.R.R.) BURGESS, ANTHONY Rabinovitz, Rubin, "Ethical Values in An- thony Burgess's Clockwork Orange," Studies in the Novel, 11:43-50, Spring 1979. In A Clockwork Orange, the clash between the lawless hero and a society that hopes to control him "obscures another conflict which is nevertheless very important: the opposing views of libertarians and au- thoritarians on how best to provide social controls. The theme of libertarian- authoritarian opposition recurs throughout Burgess's novels, often as a conflict between points of view Burgess has called Pelagian and Augustinian." (R.B.) BUTOR, MICHEL Waelti-Waelters, Jennifer, "The Architec- tural and Musical Influences of Michel Butor's Description de San Marco," Revue de Litterature Comparee, 53:65-75, Jan.- March 1979. The book is structured and constructed with references not only to the architecture of Saint Mark's Basilica, but also to the Cantorum Sacrum in honor of Saint Mark by Stravinski. (J.-L.F.) CABRERA INFANTE, GUILLERMO Ludmer, Josefina, "Tres tristes tigres: Or- denes literarios yjerarquias sociales," Re- vista Iberoamericana, 45:493-513, June- Sept. 1979. Cabrera Infante's novel is a precisely sym- metrical game with mirrors in which the opposition between oral and written lan- guage stands for the one between woman and man, lower and upper classes, inno- cence and betrayal. Paradoxically, writing-the reproduction of speech- becomes the true original in a world where the true Word has been immobilized and replaced by a static play of copies. (P.K.S.) CAIN, JAMES M. Fine, David M., "James M. Cain and the Los Angeles Novel," American Studies, 20, No. 1:25-34, Spring 1979. "Cain gave us the chief metaphors for the literary identity of Los Angeles," which have been automobiles and architecture since the publication of The Postman Always Rings Twice in 1934. (W.G.F.) CAMUS, MARCEL Dunwoodie, P., "Caligula: l'Univers dos- toievskien et l'evolution de Scipion," Revue de Litt,rature Comparee, 53:220-30, April-June 1979. While Scipion's overt opposition to Caligula in the first manuscripts goes further than Aliocha's ineffectual stand against Ivan, his ambiguous attitude in the post-war versions reflects the refusal to judge or act and the compassion which are Aliocha's attitude towards his brother. (J.-L.F.) Hurley, C. Harold, "Is Joyce's 'A Painful Case' a Source for Camus' L'Etranger?" Romance Notes, 20:157-62, Winter 1980. In the absence of external evidence, the resemblances between Duffy and Meur- 352</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY sault's rooms and effects, particularly the patent medicine clippings, point to the pos- sibility that Joyce provides Camus with sig- nificant materials. (J.-L.F.) CARPENTIER, ALEJO Alonso, Carlos J., " 'Viaje a la semilla': his- toria de una entelequia," MLN, 94:386-93, March 1979. The influence of Spengler's concept of history is manifested in Carpentier's works of the 1940s, including "Viaje a la semilla," where he postulates the existence of a Latin-American conscience that lacks con- cern for self-contemplation, as is typical of a civilization still in its infancy, according to Spengler. (M.M.R.) CASONA, ALEJANDRO Boring, Phyllis Zatlin, "Alejandro Casona and Nikolai Evreinov: Life as Theatre," Modern Drama, 22:79-88, March 1979. "Casona gradually shifts from a Pirandel- lian theme of the individual's escape from reality through fantasy or lunacy, to Ev- reinov's concept of theatricalized life as a means of bringing happiness to others." (P.J.M.) CATHER, WILLA Machen, Meredith R., "Carlyle's Presence in The Professor's House," Western American Literature, 14:273-86, Winter 1980. Correspondences between Sartor Resartus and Cather's novel in structure, charac- terization and theme "help to explain many puzzling features of the novel." (W.G.F.) CERNUDA, LUIS Bellver, C. G., "The City as Antagonist in the Poetry of Luis Cernuda," Romance Notes, 19:156-65, Winter 1978. The city is an objective correlative of the alienation and hostility Cernuda senses in the world around him. (J.-L.F.) Dietz, Bernd, "Luis Cernuda, traductor de poesia inglesa y alemana," Cuadernos His- panoamericanos, 350:283-99, Aug. 1979. The study of Cernuda's translations of En- glish and German poetry is helpful in com- prehending his literary individuality. (M.M.R.) CHAR, RENE Kliinner, Lothar, "Schritte mit Rene Char," Neue Rundschau 90:361-70, No. 3, 1979. The first step is back into one's own dark- ness. The second is to gain entry by pul- verizing the poem. The third is a step back, a distancing that makes inwardness and the discovery of truth possible. (J.D.B.) CHICANO POETRY Villanueva, Tino, "Apuntes sobre la poesia chicana," Papeles de Son Armadans, 271- 72-73:41-70, Oct., Nov., Dec. 1978. In dealing with Chicano Literature critics must take note of the importance of "bisen- sibilismo," feeling reality from two points of reference, since it is at the heart of Chicano aesthetics. (M.M.R.) CHINESE FICTION Tsai, Meishi, "Steel and Fire: Revolutionary Types in Contemporary Chinese Fic- tion," Critique, 20:5-26, No. 3, 1979. Five Warriors on the Langya Mountain by Xing Ye, Sun Futin and Ho Guyan, Defend Yenan by Du Pengcheng, Steeled and Tem- pered by Ai Wu, and The Bright Road by Hao Ran present "representative heroic person- ages" and reveal "the novelists' charac- terization of two heroic types-the In- vincible and the Indefatigable-both as an embodiment of a revolutionary idea and as an exercise of literary technique for the ideologically-oriented writers." (S.S.H.) CHOPIN, KATE Wolstenholme, Susan, "Kate Chopin's Sources for 'Mrs. Mobry's Reason'," American Literature, 51:540-3, Jan. 1980. Chopin's story "domesticates a theme Hen- rik Ibsen and Richard Wagner played on a grander scale: that the sins of parents are visited upon their children." (W.G.F.) CIXOUS, HELENE Andermatt, Verena, "Helene Cixous and the Uncovery of a Feminine Language," Women and Literature, 7, No. 1:38-48, Winter 1979. "Cixous rather than insisiting on an ex- change of words in an efficiently com- municative context appeals to supple rhythms of the written word which she asks the reader to feel and understand at once in order to decenter the privilege of voice 353</page><page sequence="7">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE which in the Judeo-Christian world has de- volved from the authority of a god or fa- ther." (K.G.K.) COLETTE Stewart, Joan Hinde, "Colette and the Hallowing of Age," Romance Notes, 20:172-7, Winter 1980. Chrin, where the heroine is growing old, and La Fin de Chiri, where she is installed in old age, can be considered as a demonstra- tion of Susan Sontag's distinction between aging and old age, in "The Double Stan- dard of Aging." (J.-L.F.) COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Camurati, Mireya, "Bifurcaci6n, multi- plicaci6n, ficci6n (Borges y Butor)," His- panofila, 65:69-74, Jan. 1979. There is an "arbitrary" association between Borges' The Garden of Forking Paths and Butor's Rpertoire II: Etudes et conferences 1959-63, in that they see man's knowledge of reality as the product of a deformed and even fictional narrative. (M.M.R.) Cramer, Mark, "Influence of Pablo Neruda on the Poetry of Robert Bly," Hispanofila, 67:39-59, Sept. 1979. "Within the ideology of deep image poetry, the question remains as to whether or not Neruda's influence has been positive." While some of the poems in The Light Around the Body reflect "an unresolved con- tradiction" between Neruda's dynamism and the author's meditative sensitivity, in others, Bly's poetry seems to have strengthened without losing its sensitiv- ity. (M.M.R.) Gaggi, Silvio, "Brecht, Pirandello, and Two Traditions of Self-Critical Art," Theatre Quarterly, 8, No. 32:42-6, Winter 1979. "Pirandello and Brecht both participate in the self-critical modern tradition, asking similar questions about the relationship between art and life, but the answers they come up with represent opposing poles in terms of aesthetic distance and the art-life relationship." (M.L.) Ivask, Ivar, "Reflections of Estonia's Fate in the Poetry of Betti Alver and Jaan Kap- linski," Journal of Baltic Studies, 10:352-60, Winter 1979. Although these poets belong to very dif- ferent generations (Alver b. 1906 and Kap- linski b. 1941), their poetry has many com- mon traits. They both depict the tragedy of their native Estonia; furthermore they both are aware of ecological problems. The word ecology stems from the Greek word "oikos" and it "may provide a key to Alver's as well as Kaplinski's loving concern for their na- tive land." (V.D.) Maligec, Verg, "Analisis comparativo de El solter6n de Leopoldo Lugones y The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock de T. S. Eliot," Hispan6fila, 67:89-97, Sept. 1979. "Departing from the same theme or figure, and using similar techniques, Lugones and Eliot have created two diametrically op- posed characters." (M.M.R.) Merchant, Paul, "The Theatre Poems of Bertolt Brecht, Edward Bond, and How- ard Brenton," Theatre Quarterly, 9, No. 34:49-51, Summer 1979. Recent publications of the theatre poems of these three playwrights "offer a startling reminder of an almost unused dimension for poetry in this century." A review of their work shows "the power of these voices." (M.L.) Miles, David H., "Reality and the Two Realisms: Mimesis in Auerbach, Lukacs, and Handke," Monatshefte, 71:371-8, Winter 1979. "Two seemingly contradictory theories dominate literary debates on 'realism': Lukacs' ... grounds itself in Hegel's argu- ment that classical Homeric narration em- bodied an elevated portrayal of daily events ..." whereas Handke's realism . .. stresses an anti-classical proliferation of 'das Be- sondere' at the expense of any 'Allgemeines.' [The] emphasis in Handke [is] on a host of 'inessential' details. ..." (K.M.W.) Obuke, Okpure O., "The Poetics of Wole Soyinka and J. P. Clark: A Comparative Analysis," World Literature Today, 52:216-23, Spring 1978. "... the difference in the poetry of Wole Soyinka and J. P. Clark is not so much in the subject matter and themes, but in their treatment of similar themes." (DJ.L.) Otero, Jose, "H. G. Wells y E. Anderson Imbert: The Truth about Pyecraft y El leve Pedro," Hispanofila, 67:83-8, Sept. 1979. H. G. Wells' story, The Truth about Pyecraft, is an instrument of inspirations, and the product, El leve Pedro, is in effect original for its great poetic intuition.

Despite some differences in their treatment of the mother, both contemporary African and African-American poetry tend to praise her. (J.S.) Solberg, Sara M., "On Comparing Apples and Oranges: James Joyce and Thomas Pynchon," Comparative Literature Studies, 16:33-40, March 1979. Internal evidence indicates that Pynchon deliberately used details and devices of Joyce, although both authors, by refusing to be totally clear, "sabotage" efforts to prove influence; regardless of influence, however, a comparison can enrich our reading of both. (G.S.) COOVER, ROBERT Hume, Kathryn, "Robert Coover's Fiction: The Naked and the Mythic," Novel: A Forum on Fiction, 12:127-48, Winter 1979. Coover's fiction reveals "a balance of forces." He depicts "helplessness," yet also "analyzes the fashions in which man sum- mons up mythic value systems." (J.S.) Kissel, Susan, "The Contemporary Artist and His Audience in the Short Stories of Robert Coover," Studies in Short Fiction, 16:49-54, Winter 1979. In his stories, "Coover suggests that the contemporary artist-bound as he is to his audience as performer, magician, and funhouse designer, and sensitive as he must be to the expectations and desires of those he entertains-nevertheless must not let his readers exert ultimate control over his ef- forts." ... he suggests that the contempo- rary literary audience ... is guilty of the mass audience's exploitive, hostile demands for entertainment." (S.S.H.) CORTAZAR, JULIO Hernandez, Ana Maria, "Camaleonismo y vampirismo: La poetica de Julio Cor- tazar," Revista Iberoamericana, 45:475-92, June-Sept. 1979. Cortazar has borrowed two key symbols from the English romantic tradition: Keats' concept of the poet as a "chameleon" who takes on the nature of the people and ob- jects around him; and more fundamentally, Poe's vision of the poet-vampire who can only "know" the things and people he loves by sucking out their life. (P.K.S.) Pic6n Garfield, Evelyn, "Usted tiende la mano a tu pr6jimo: Alguien que anda por ahi de Julio Cortazar," Revista Iberoamericana, 44:89-98, Jan.-June 1978. Cortazar's latest book of short stories shows a departure from the isolated protagonists of his earlier works toward a communion with others expressed through political themes, studies of the search for love, and experiments with double or group narra- tive points of view. (P.K.S.) CUNQUEIRO, ALVARO Thomas, Michael D., "Cunqueiro's Un hombre que se parecia a Orestes: A Humor- ous Revitalization of an Ancient Myth," Hispania, 61:35-45, March 1978. In Part One the narrator leads the reader to believe and then to doubt that don Le6n is the returning Orestes. "Deceived expecta- tions" becomes a theme in Part Two, where the reader sympathizes with the aging, paranoid ruler, Egisto. "Part Three effects a similar humanization of ... Orestes." This modernized myth, reflecting the political situation of Franco Spain, suggests that "in the contemporary context, ven- geance seems fruitless." (N.A.N.) DAHLBERG, EDWARD Fendelman, Earl, "Edward Dahlberg's Art of Memory," Journal of Modern Literature, 7:113-26, Feb. 1979. In his autobiographical writings "Dahlberg transposes Augustine's situation into a modern context: he explores the pos- sibilities of memory in a world where no deity intervenes." (D.P.) DAMAS, LEON-GONTRAN Leiner, J., "Leon-Gontran Damas ou du surrealisme comme moyen d'acces a l'identite," Romance Notes, 20:17-23, Fall 1979. Instead of searching for linguistic subtleties and rarities in order to prove his adequa- tion to French culture, Damas refuses all literature of imitation and appears as the founder of the negritude movement, well be- fore Cesaire and Senghor.

(K.G.K.) DE LA MARE, WALTER Jacobsen, Josephine, "The Masks of Walter De La Mare," Sewanee Review, 86:549-56, Oct.-Dec. 1978.

DETECTIVE NOVEL Butt, Wolfgang, "Vom Polizeiroman zum Anti-Polizei-Roman,"Akzente, 25:357-66, Aug. 1978. "Sjowall and Wahloo have gained a pre- viously unused dimension for the genre [of the detective novel] ... they have under- taken the attempt to free criminality from the societal no man's land of trivial or merely psychologizing literature and to place it in a concrete political space." (.R.R.) DOBLIN, ALFRED Duytschaever, Joris, "Alfred Doblins Aischylos-Rezeption," Revue de Litterature Comparee, 53:27-46, Jan.-March 1979. The Greek allusions in Berlin Alexanderplatz, with their ironical and universalizing functions, suggest parallels between Orestes and Doblin's protagonist, while stressing divergent political implications in terms of class consciousness. (J.-L.F.) Schweikert, Uwe, "Mythos, Geschichte, Aktualitit. Das Werk Alfred Doblins," Neue Rundschau 89:588-99, No. 4, 1978. One constant runs through D6blin's works: "the life-long fluctuation between political revolt and mysticism, between lucid ration- ality and sexual pathology," realized in a montage technique, a process of dissocia- tion that depends on the reader's participa- tion to be formed into a whole. (J.D.B.) DOS PASSOS, JOHN Marz, Charles, "Dos Passos's Newsreels: The Noise of History," Studies in the Novel, 11:194-200, Summer 1979. "The meanings of the Newsreels [of U.S.A.] are not located finally in the world of his- torical actions and consequences ... They invade the text; they collide with the Cam- era Eye; scraps of reality, records of things, vestiges of the past set adrift; the wreckage of public voices buries the individual and silences him. Man is gradually replaced by his artifacts, by word and world debris, by the slowly and inevitably triumphant noise of history." (R.B.) DREISER, THEODORE Mookerjee, R. N., "Dreiser's Views on Art and Fiction," American Literary Realism, 1870-1910, 12:338-42, Autumn 1979. Although Dreiser involved himself in social reform and radical movements, he did not think that "art should be used as a means of propaganda or to convey any kind of social message." (W.G.F.) ELIOT, T. S. Joost, Nicholas and Alan Brown, "T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway: A Literary Relationship," Papers on Language &amp; Lit- erature, 14:425-49, Fall 1978. Personality differences notwithstanding, Eliot's work tutored Hemingway in such aspects of writing as choice of quotations, attitude toward the writer as artist, sex and religious odysseys. (G.S.S.) ENZENSBERGER, HANS MAGNUS Sewell, William B., "Doppelganger Motif and Two-Voiced Poem in the Works of Hans Magnus Enzensberger," German Quarterly 52:503-17, Nov. 1979. The conflict between the necessity of revo- lutionary action and the fear that all politi- cal activity is doomed to failure is the basis of Enzensberger's use of the "Doppel- ganger" motif and of the two-voiced structure of his poetry.

Even though The Marionettes and The Marble 356</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY Faun are indebted to Romanticism, Sym- bolism, andfin de siecle literature, they can be read as anticipations of the fiction to come. (J.-L.F.) Brown, Calvin, "Faulkner as Aphorist," Revue de Litterature Comparee, 53:277-98, July-Sept. 1979. The aphorisms have three functions: they are characterizing devices, they help to es- tablish the rhythm, and they serve to uni- versalize local settings and characters; they do not always express Faulkner's own opinions. (J.-L.F.) Brown, May Cameron, "The Language of Chaos: Quentin Compson in The Sound and the Fury," American Literature, 51:544-53, Jan. 1980. In Quentin's section, "the unusual blend of order and chaos," "the illusory, obsessive imagery" and "his inability to find and re- flect a meaning in his experience" reflect "the decaying world ... at the heart of the novel." (W.G.F.) De Labriolle, Jacqueline, "De Faulkner a Claude Simon," Revue de Littirature Com- paree, 53:358-88, July-Sept. 1979. In La route des Flandres, Simon's narrative is "blocked" by its phantasms; in Absalom, Ab- salom!, Sartoris, Light in August and Requiem, Faulkner uses narrative as "psychodrama." (J.-L.F.) Imbert, Henri-Francois, "Une esthetique de la fascination: d'Absalom, Absalom! a Un roi sans divertissement," Revue de Littirature Comparee, 53:323-37, July-Sept. 1979. A parallel study of Faulkner and Giono shows how their heroes Sutpen and Langlois are examples of a technique of fascination. (.-L.F.) Minter, David, "Faulkner, Childhood, and the Making of The Sound and the Fury," American Literature, 51:376-93, Nov. 1979. In The Sound and the Fury, Faulkner "took possession of the pain and muted love of his childhood." The loss in the novel is "associ- ated with parental weakness and inadequacy-with parental frigidity, judg- ment, and rejection." (W.G.F.) Scherer, Olga, "Rosie Coldfield et Vanka Karamazov," Revue de Littirature Com- paree, 53:311-22, July-Sept. 1979. The diminutive form of "Rosie" and "Vanka" helps the other elements which are active in the polyphonic structure of the two novels to achieve a degree of self- awareness in the characters involved. (J.-L.F.) Shapiro, Jol, " 'Une histoire contee par un idiot .. .'," Revue de Littirature Comparee, 53:338-47, July-Sept. 1979. The monologue of Macario in Juan Rulfo's Macario bears comparison to the monologue of Benjy in The Sound and the Fury. Rulfo's originality reveals itself in its expression of desire, hunger, and fear of hell. (J.-L.F.) Sykes, S. W., "The Novel as Conjuration: Absalom, Absalom! and La route des Flandres," Revue de Littirature Comparee, 53:348-57, July-Sept. 1979. While the two novels are alike in their in- ventive reconstruction of history and dem- onstrate the same two meanings of "conju- ration" (the summoning-up of figures from the past and the incantatory use of lan- guage), Simon is more concerned with the formal variations. (J.-L.F.) Uroff, Margaret Dickie, "The Fictions of Absalom, Absalom!" Studies in the Novel, 11:431-45, Winter 1979. "The anxieties of fiction-making that are everywhere apparent in Absalom, Absalom! deserve examination because they reveal not only Faulkner's attitude toward the pos- sibilities of fiction but also his growing skepticism about his material ..." (R.B.) Werner, Craig, "Beyond Realism and Romanticism: Joyce, Faulkner and the Tradition of the American Novel," Cen- tennial Review, 23:242-62, Summer 1979. "... Faulkner not only knew Joyce's works but adapted Joycean techniques to his own voice in a way which helped him, beginning with his work of the 1920s and culminating in Go Down, Moses, to rise at least mo- mentarily above the conflict of the roman- tic and realistic traditions of the American novel." (PJ.M.) FERLINGHETTI, LAWRENCE Skau, Michael, "Toward a Third Stream Theatre: Lawrence Ferlinghetti's Plays," Moder Drama, 22:29-38, March 1979. "For Ferlinghetti, dramatic experimenta- tion has a moral purpose: the liberation of the theatre and freedom from dramatic conventions can offer the liberation of the individual identity and the free ego, and the 'new theatre' can thus contribute to the evolution of the new man."

Macdeonio Fernandez, a key figure in the Spanish-American vanguard of the 1920s, developed an aesthetic that rejects con- ventional genres and representational writing in favor of three techniques: metaphor jthe "transfiguration of the un- representable"), conceptual humor ("the momentary belief in an absurdity"), and the fictional character who works to convince the reader that his personal identity is an- other fiction. (P.K.S.) FICTION Bloodworth, William, "Literary Extensions of the Formula Western," Western Ameri- can Literature, 14:287-96, Winter 1980. Although recent "literary Westerns," be- ginning with The Ox-Bow Incident, have been viewed "as a way of criticizing, satirizing, or making other kinds of negative judgments about the formula stories," they actually tend to affirm some of the others' basic themes. (W.G.F.) Foley, Barbara, "From U.S.A. to Ragtime: Notes on the Forms of Historical Con- sciousness in Modern Fiction," American Literature, 50:85-105, March 1978. Despite E. L. Doctorow's Ragtime's obvious similarities to Dos Passos' trilogy, it is closer in outlook to such "apocalyptic" historical novels as Pynchon's V and Garcia Marquez' One Hundred Years of Solitude, in which his- tory is "ultimately absurd" and any coher- ence comes not from the materials but the narrator's control. (W.G.F.) FONTANE, THEODOR Schumann, Willy, "Wo ist der Kaiser? Theodor Fontane uber Kaiser Wilhelm II," Monatshefte, 71:161-71, Summer 1979.

FUENTES, CARLOS Garcia de Aldridge, Adriana, "La dialectica contemporanea: 'Tiempo propio-tiempo total' en Cumpleanos," Revista Ibero- americana, 45:513-35, June-Sept. 1979. Carlos Fuentes' novel Cumpleanos (Birth- day), often dismissed as self-indulgently obscure, can be understood as a re-telling of the dualist myths found among the an- cient Celts and medieval heretical sects. This underground religious tradition saw the universe as a dynamic union of oppo- sites which weave an eternity out of endless repetitions. (P.K.S.) Kerr, Lucille, "The Paradox of Power and Mystery: Carlos Fuentes' Terra nostra," PMLA, 95:91-102, Jan. 1980. Fuentes explores "the problematics of ab- solute authority" in Terra nostra.

The narrator of Wunschloses Ungliick (A Sorrow Beyond Dreams) comes up against the problem of finding an "adequate language" to tell the story of his mother's life.

(J.S.) Hagemann, Meyly Chin, "Hemingway's Se- cret: Visual to Verbal Art," Journal of Modern Literature, 7:87-112, Feb. 1979. Hemingway wrote three short stories- "Out of Season," "Indian Camp," and "Big Two-Hearted River"-under the direct in- fluence of Cezanne's art.

(M.L.) Thorne, Creath S., "The Shape of Equivo- cation in Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls," American Literature, 51:520-35, Jan. 1980. "... the idea of tragedy lies at the center of Hemingway's oeuvre," but this idea is worked out "in different novelistic forms."

Doody, Terrence, "Don Quixote, Ulysses, and the Idea of Realism," Novel: A Forum on Fiction, 12:197-214, Spring 1979.

Egan, Joseph J., "Romantic Ireland, Dead and Gone: Joyce's 'Araby' as National Myth," Colby Library Quarterly, 15:188-93, Sept. 1979. Joyce's story uses "national imagery drawn from Irish culture and history" to create a darkly "mythic vision of a country." (J.S.) Gandelman, Claude, "Finnegans Wake and the Anthropomorphic Landscape,"Jour- nal of Modern Literature, 7:39-50, Feb. 1979. The underlying structure of Finnegans Wake is constituted of two elements: "on the conscious level ... the Roman Catholic myth received a new content by being fused with the Freudian kaleidoscopic view of Man, while on the other, the encounter with the Mannerist presentation of Man as an anthromorphic landscape ... provided Joyce with pictorial equivalents of his vision and technique for hiding sexual meanings behind topography . ..."

Schiffer, Paul S., "'Homing, upstream': Fictional Closure and the End of Ulysses," James Joyce Quarterly, 16:283-98, Spring 1979. A study of the relationship between Ulysses's ending and the problem of "fictional clo- sure" in general reveals how Joyce uses his earlier esthetic theories masterfully. (M.Z.) Spilka, Mark, "Leopold Bloom as Jewish Pickwick: A Neo-Dickensian Perspec- tive," Novel: A Forum on Fiction, 13:121-46, Fall 1979. In Ulysses Joyce constructs a "modern ver- sion of Victorian wholesomeness," in a more psychological portrayal of the "middle-class decency" which Dickens' characters externalize. (J.S.) Storey, Robert, "The Argument of Ulysses Reconsidered," Modern Language Quar- terly, 40:175-95, June 1979. In Ulysses, Joyce invested Stephen and Bloom with aspects of his own self, Bloom being of the same essence as Stephen but of "a different pitch"; thus Joyce also remakes himself and finally "refines" himself "out of existence" in order to become both Noman and Everyman. (G.S.) Voelker, Joseph, "Molly Bloom and the Rhetorical Tradition," Comparative Lit- erature Studies, 16:146-64, June 1979. Erasmus' Encomium Moriae and "The Wife of Bath's Prologue" can be seen as homeomorphic parallels of the "Penelope" section of Ulysses, both in subject matter and rhetorical method. (G.S.) Zingrone, Frank, "Joyce and D'Annunzio: the Marriage of Fire and Water," James Joyce Quarterly, 16:253-65, Spring 1979.

Although ambivalent about his commit- ment, as he was about so much in life, Kafka was nevertheless a Zionist who, even before the coming of National Socialism, made practical preparations for his emi- gration to Palestine. (J.D.B.) Grimm, Reinhold, "Comparing Kafka and Nietzsche," German Quarterly, 52:339-50, May 1979. Neither Max Brod's emphatic denial of a relationship between Kafka and Nietzsche nor Patrick Bridgwater's insistence on their great similarity seems to be the proper ap- proach to comparing the two writers. Grounds for comparison may be better found in the obsession of both writers with the truth and with concealing it. (J.D.B.) Sokel, Walter H., "Language and Truth in the Two Worlds of Franz Kafka," German Quarterly, 52:364-84, May 1979. In Kafka, language as a tool cannot express the truth. Only as a communal dialogue can language do anything other than show the retreat of untruth. Literature should be a process of "becoming a metaphor" rather than writing one, so that "the self estab- lishes its participation in the community that is language." (J.D.B.) Strong, William G., "The Varieties of First-Person Narration: Four Stories by Kafka," German Quarterly, 52:472-85, Nov. 1979. In four of Kafka's first-person stories, all probably written in 1917, no single function for their first-person narration can be de- termined. "Even within a single story the first person performs various functions si- multaneously," functions that are not nec- essarily similar. (J.D.B.) KAISER, GEORG Konecny, Silvia, "Georg Kaisers Komg Hahn- rei," Zeitschrift fiir deutsche Philologie, 97:256-70, June 1978.

"The Summing-up of Si- lence: The Poetry of Ihor Kalynets'," Slavic Review, 38:17-29, March 1979. Ihor Kalynets', the prolific Ukrainian poet, has not written a single line of poetry since his imprisonment. If Shevchenko saw hope for the Ukraine in the glory that was buried in the Cossack mounds, Kalynets' sees hope only in the self-will which must be forged in dungeons. (V.D.) KHARMS, DANIIL Nakhimovsky, Alice S.,-"The Ordinary, the Sacred, and the Grotesque in Daniil Kharms's The Old Woman," Slavic Review, 37:203-16, June 1978. Kharms is a poet, black humorist, creator of Russia's short-lived literature of the absurd. "The spiritual idea behind The Old Woman is simple and traditional: acknowledgment of the presence of God. Neither here nor in any of his other works does Kharms break new ground in Christianity. What is unex- pected is the appearance of the spiritual as the other side of daily existence (the 'mira- cle' that Kharms was waiting for) and its development through the comic gro- tesque." (V.D.) KOVACS, VILMOS Szakolczay, Lajos, "Lira es szenvedely: Kovacs Vilmosr6l," Tiszatij, 32:67-73, Nov. 1978. Kovacs' poetic works (Vallani kell, Tavaszi viharok) are characterized by a plastic portrayal of nature and a struggle for jus- tice in society; his novel, Holnapra is eliink, portrays provincialism and the condition of the Hungarian minority in the Carpatho- Ukraine.

The founding of the John Reed Club was an "important moment in the history of the left in American Literature."

Like the revelations of voyeurs, the conver- sation of Pinter's characters involves a "screen memory" that detaches the charac- ters from the truth and allows them to con- trol their world; this device is both a weapon and a defense and leaves the audi- ence uncertain about the line between reality and assertion. (G.S.) Kreps, Barbara, "Time and Harold Pinter's Possible Realities: Art as Life, and Vice Versa," Modern Drama, 22:47-60, March 1979.

PUIG, MANUEL Echavarren, Roberto, "El beso de la mujer arafia y las metaforas del sujeto," Revista Iberoamericana, 44:65-75, Jan.-June 1978. Manuel Puig's fourth novel uses the dialogue between a homosexual and an urban guerrilla in a prison cell to explore links among sexual identity, violence, and the romantic fantasies of the movies.

SARDUY, SEVERO Mendez, Adriana, "Erotismo, cultura y sujeto en De donde son los cantantes," Re- vista Iberoamericana, 44:45-63, Jan.-June 1978. Severo Sarduy's neo-Baroque novel attacks the bourgeois concepts of culture, literary character, and communicative language. Personality is revealed as an imposture, sexual identity as a transvestite game, the search for origins as a delusion, and the idea of a "signified" behind words as an infinite regression leading to an ab- sence.

"... there are two decisive factors in the appearance of a new genre convention.

Bater, the "clefted" and longed for moun- tain in the Song of Songs, is incorporated in a modern Israeli poem about the questing "dove"-the "beloved" of the Canticles, the "Assembled People" in Rabbinical Com- mentary, and in modern Hebrew literature solitary Jewish man in search of a "crag" of defense.

The two initiators of modern Hebrew fic- tion about Sephardic Jewry express con- tradictory views about its life as a "tragedy of character" (Shami) and a "tragedy of nature" (Burla). Shami despairs of better- ment and disregards the individual initia- tive of women and Arab-Jewish relations, whereas these themes are the center qf Burla's work. (A.W.)

Skema once wrote "That every man is a very old actor and while watching a performance he associates with an actor on the stage, ob- serving his own eternal anxiety in life mys- teries." Skema is a dramatist of the 20th century where a man is focal and about whom all other worlds created by dramas are orbiting. (V.D.)

STEINBECK, JOHN DeMott, Robert, "The Interior Distances of John Steinbeck," Steinbeck Quarterly, 12:86-99, Summer-Fall 1979. Four elements springing from the writer's unconscious-symbolic landscapes, images of enclosure, dreams and creativity-occur often enough in Steinbeck's work to suggest his adherence not only to mimetic writing, but the larger tradition of Romantic fic- tionizing. (W.G.F.) Ditsky, John, "Steinbeck's Bombs Away: The Group-man in the Wild Blue Yonder," Steinbeck Quarterly, 12:5-14, Winter- Spring, 1979. By the very slightness of Bombs Away, Steinbeck betrays in it "the crucial point in his own intellectual development engen- dered by the collapse of the notion of the group-man" which had long fascinated him. (W.G.F.) Federle, Steven J., "Lifeboat as Allegory: Steinbeck and the Demon of War," Stein- beck Quarterly, 12:14-20, Winter-Spring 1979. Steinbeck's unpublished novel "is based on much broader humanitarian values" than the Alfred Hitchcock film based on it, as is indicated by the "profoundly ironic note" of Steinbeck's ending "in contrast to Hitch- cock's suspensefully dramatic but morally empty conclusion." (W.G.F.) Hayashi, Tetsumaro, "Steinbeck's Winter as Shakespearean Fiction," Steinbeck Quar- terly, 12:107-15, Summer-Fall 1979. Frequent allusions to Macbeth and Richard III in The Winter of Our Discontent "reinforce not only Steinbeck's tragic and prophetic vision but also his conscious effort to pro- ject an image of a moral wasteland ... as a warning against the further spiritual de- cline of the west." (W.G.F.) Mackendrick, Louis K., "The Popular Art of Discontent: Steinbeck's Masterful Winter," Steinbeck Quarterly, 12:99-107, Summer-Fall 1979.

THEATER Pearson, Anthony G., "The Cabaret Comes to Russia: 'Theatre of Small Forms' as Cultural Catalyst," Theatre Quarterly, 9, No. 36:31-44, Winter 1980. Following the Revolution of 1905 there emerged in Russia the "intimate theatre of 'small forms,' the late night cabaret establishment-the elitist cellar-club com- mitted to an intellectual miniaturized rep- ertoire primarily of satirical and parodistic content." This kind of theatre added "sig- nificant contributions to the cultural achievements of the Silver Age." (M.L.) THOMAS, EDWARD Kirkham, Michael, "The 'Desert Places' in Edward Thomas's Poetry," University of Toronto Quarterly, 48:283-302, Summer 1979.

Dyson, A. E., "The Poetry of R.S. Thomas," Critical Quarterly, 20:5-31, No. 2, Sum- mer 1978. "Thomas is... a poet of the Cross; and the Cross without the exegesis or piety of the ages to help it-more than ever facing us with its own starkness, as God's side of the dialogue." (A.S.W.) TRAKL, GEORG Yu, Pauline, "The Poetics of Discontinuity: East-West Correspondences in Lyric Po- etry," PMLA 94:261-74, March 1979. Georg Trakl shares with poets of the T'ang dynasty "a reliance on concrete imagery and on parataxis, an isolating syntax that thwarts expectations of linear logical, causal, or temporal progressions and insists that a poem works more through the evocative power of juxtaposed objects than through direct propositional dis- course." (J.D.B.) UNAMUNO, MIGUEL DE Crone, Anne Lisa, "Unamuno and Dos- toevsky: Some Thoughts on Atheistic Humanitarianism," Hispanofila, 64:43-59, Sept. 1978. A comparative study of Unamuno's San Manuel Bueno, mirtir and Dostoevsky's The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor reveals that in his novel, Unamuno ". .. refuted Dos- toevsky's thesis that atheistic humanitari- anism is impossible." (M.M.R.) Friedman, Edward H., "From Concept to Drama: The Other Unamuno," His- panofila, 68:29-38, Jan. 1980. Unamuno's "novels ... have a strongly dramatic quality ... while his theater has been considered antidramatic." This is so because the author ... "aims for revelation rather than amusement, for introspection rather than spectacle." (M.M.R.) Predmore, Susan, "San Manuel Bueno, mir- tir: A Jungian Perspective," Hispanofila, 64:15-29, Sept. 1978. Unamuno symbolically presents the con- flicting aspects of his personality in the psyche of the character, San Manuel.

(J.-L.F.) WALSER, MARTIN Fetz, Gerald A., "Martin Walser's Sauspiel and the Contemporary German History Play," Comparative Drama, 12:249-65, Fall 1978. "... Das Sauspiel displays a distinct shift in style, a new theme (it is the first historical play by Walser to deal with the not-so- recent past), and a ... more definite politi- cal stance than in his previous works." "Al- though it differs in style, choice of theme and in overall execution from other con- temporary German history plays, Das Sau- spiel can be viewed as representative in many ways of this revitalized genre." (D.P.) Kaiser, Joachim, "Martin Walsers blindes Glanzstiick," Merkur, 32:828-38, Aug. 1978. Upon viewing Walser's novella A Fleeing Horse "we are frightened by so much clever classicism. ...

WALSER, ROBERT Matt, Peter von, "Die Schwache des Vaters und das JVergniigen des Sohnes: Uber die Voraussetzungen der Frohlichkeit bei Robert Walser," Neue Rundschau 90:197-213, No. 2, 1979. Robert Walser adapted his father's strategy of weakness, that of giving in immediately in every conflict while at the same time nurturing a sly and secret enjoyment. But in his literary achievement he was obeying his mother's insistence on successful pro- ductivity. (J.D.B.) WARREN, ROBERT PENN Johnson, Glen M., "The Pastness of All the King's Men," American Literature, 51:553-7, Jan. 1980. "Warren's sense of cultural responsibility is embodied in his book's rhetorical structure, which opens out to include a reader's wider historical experience, and thus to enlist that reader as a participant in history" on both factual and fictional levels. (W.G.F.) Mansfield, Luther Stearns, "History and the Historical Process in All the King's Men," Centennial Review, 22:214-30, Spring 1978. Every character in All the King's Men illus- trates some element of Warren's historical theory, but these various elements come to- gether in the many sided character of Jack Burden. Warren's concern with a theory of history and the historical process make the novel "a profound meditation on life." (PJ.M.) Wilcox, Earl J., "'A Cause for Laughter, A Thing for Tears:' Humor in All the King's Men," Southern LiteraryJournal, 12:27-35, Fall 1979. Jack Burden "dons a mask which he calls at one point his 'grim humor,' or at another, his 'satanic humor.' This mask shields him from seeing life as it really is." "Structurally, the mask of humor works for Warren as an introduction to Burden's mind prior to his 'fall.'" At the end of the novel, "Jack Bur- den is a man whose 'cause for laughter' has turned to a 'thing for tears.'" (R.B.) WELLS, H.G. Hughes, David Y., "Criticism in English of H.G.

(K.G.K.) WILLIAMS, CHARLES Manlove, C.N., "The Liturgical Novels of Charles Williams," Mosaic, 12:161-81, No. 2, 1979. "The life of Williams' novels ... lies ... in the stimulus they give to the mind: the laws by which the strangeness of the magic is gradually seen to be part of a pattern. The approach, at once forensic and adoring, of the protagonists to a greater understanding of God's ways; the enormously subtle and stimulating ideas, which are yet rooted in tradition; and the prodigious moral and spiritual intelligence of the author." (K.G.K.) WOLF, CHRISTA McGauren, Fergus, "'Gebrochene Generationen': Christa Wolf and Theodor Storm," German Life &amp; Letters, N.S. 31:328-35, July 1978.

However, the novelist of 1922, whether older or younger, man or woman, "envisioned the world of social and economic action as belonging to men and the world of moral and psycho- logical sensibility as belonging to women." Woman was uniformly portrayed "as a traditional symbol of female god- hood." (D.P.)

There are few analyses of the "metaphysical and epistemological views of the Blooms- bury writers and critics" and "the explicit doctrines ... we find in the writings of [contemporary] philosophers."

Yehoshua: Between the Dream and the Reality," Midstream, 25:48-54, Aug.-Sept. 1979. The typical Yehoshua hero is incapable of reconciling exaggerated and often ancestral ideals with demanding and present realities and is thus reduced to a state of cataleptic inaction from which the only escape is the disaster of disaffection. It is Yehoshua's task to show him this and thereby strengthen him for a confrontation. (A.W.) 383</page></plain_text>
