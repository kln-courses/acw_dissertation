<plain_text><page sequence="1">Filarete and the "qualità": architectural and social John B. Omans In the dedication of his Treatise Filarete states that he will describe the proportioni e qualità e misure of buildings and that he will demonstrate by ragione and auctorità that they derive dalla figura e forma dello huomo l. Both Vitruvius and Alberti had, of course, related the forms and proportions of buildings to those of man, but Filarete hints at a much more complete anthropomorphism. In fact Filarete, by systema- tically applying this basic proposition, formulates a theory of architecture more consistent than those of any of his predecessors. Vitruvius had only tried to impose some coherence on a tradi- tion containing many disparate elements, and Alberti had done little more than clarify and refine Vitruvius' ten books in his own. Filarete sweeps all this away in the first few pages of his twenty-four-book epic. In a completely new account of the origins of architecture he tells how God first made Adam in his own image and how then Adam or his descendants took the form of the first man as their model for the first structu- res, deriving from him misure , membri , propor- tioni and qualità . I have discussed elsewhere how Filarete here makes use of both Christian and Platonic Creation myths 2. The essential point here is that this not only provides him with an authoritative background for the tentative anthro- pomorphism of Vitruvius and Alberti, but also prepares us for a whole new theory based on the necessary correspondence between architecture and man. As the Treatise continues it becomes clear how each of the elements listed derives from the human model. For misure the braccio, or arm, as a unit of measurement is a good example, while for membri or architectural elements the capitello , derived from the Latin for head, serves as well. Many architectural proportioni are shown to derive from man including the ratio of 1 : 1 coming from man inscribed in a square. All these examples would have been understood by his predecessors but the other element said to derive from man, qualità, is a new term in an architectural context. Fortunately Filarete ex- plains at an early stage what he means here too (fol. 3r). Vitruvius, he says, talks about three architectural measures, Doric, Corinthian and Ionic, and these, Filarete says, can be seen as corresponding to the usual classification of things into large, medium, and small, and particularly to such a classification of human physical types or qualità . It is, indeed, possible to talk about Doric men, who are the tallest, being nine times as tall as their head is high, Ionic, who are the shortest, being only of seven heads, and Corin- thian, who are intermediate of eight heads. These are the main qualità of men which served as models for the main qualità in architecture. Fi- larete pushes the analogy so far as to actually apply the ancient names of the architectural orders to their human prototypes. This is all the more surprising as his application of the names does not correspond with classical archi- tectural usage. Vitruvius had been clear that Doric was the shortest column in proportion to its height, being 6 or 7 diameters tall, while Ionic (8 or 9 diameters) and Corinthian (9 diame- ters) were relatively more attenuated. Although given in diameters these proportions can be exactly compared with those of Filarete as the latter also says that the height of all his capitals is the same as the diameter of the column. This point, while establishing a certain relation between the theory of Filarete and that of Vitru- vius, also brings out another striking difference. For Vitruvius had said that the Doric capital was only half a diameter high, Ionic only a half or a third and had given to Corinthian alone a full diameter of height. The fact that surviving exam- ples of the classical orders, and Alberti's figures 1 Fol. Ir. Reference are made by folio number to the Palatina manuscript publisheb by J.R. Spencer, Fila- rete's treatise on architecture, i and ii, New Haven and London 1965. 2 See J.B.

It is typical of Filarete that he makes no particular excuse for his innovation. We are left to work out for ourselves his method of reaso- ning. Much becomes clear if we relate the uni- queness of his rules to the unique importance he attaches to the correspondence between archi- tecture and man. For, in fact, he revises the architectural rules to bring them closer to the traditional canon of human proportion. He pro- bably gives all proportions in terms of head and capital heights instead of footlengths and column diameters because the head was the main unit of measurement in the Pseudo-Varronic canon of human proportions regularly used by artists. A detailed dependence on this canon is presumably also, as Tigler has suggested, the reason why the precise figure of that canon, 1:9, is that of the Doric quality3. Once Filarete has said that Doric was copied from Adam, who represented the full perfection of God's handiwork, it is natural for him to make it correspond to the contemporary standard for the perfect human form. The same pursuit of anthropomorphism led him to reject the low capitals of ancient Doric and Ionic and accept only the ancient Corinthian form which alone had the same height in relation to the column that the head has in relation to the body. Apparently he felt that the slight differences in column height which he gave to his Corinthian and Ionic (1:8 and 1:7) did not make them incom- patible with the human form but only reflected the fact that there were many people of inferior proportions who failed to match up to the best standard. Al this explains why Filarete's system of the qualities is different from the ancient classi- fication of columns on which it is based. But there remains the problem of why Doric is now the tallest instead of being the shortest and why it is followed by Corinthian which had previously been the opposite extreme, a position now assu- med by Ionic which had previously been inter- mediate. There is no simple solution to these problems. One possible explanation for the new reference of Doric is that Vitruvius had clearly stated it to be the first in time and also copied from the male form. This, of course, made it for Filarete the column that was closest to the perfect world of Adam in Paradise and, as we have seen, the perfect human proportion, always embodied in the male, was 1 : 9. The new use of Doric thus followed easily from a re-interpretation of Vitru- vius in the light of the Christian scriptures and workshop practice. It is, moreover, likely that the change in association was particularly easy for Filarete around 1460 as it is certain that few people apart from Alberti could understand Vi- truvius well enough to know what his idea of Doric was. The classical order as such was not in regular use at the time. But Corinthian and Ionic were regularly used, and it is probably this fact that explains their placing in Filarete. For, in virtually all contemporary buildings following a tradition that was begun in the upper floor of the Florentine Baptistry these orders are used together in a way which makes the inferiority of Ionic quite clear. The Ionic columns are always lower than the Corinthian ones with which they are associated and used in less important posi- tions. What Filarete has done is add a third column to the two already in use, putting it at the top of the series and thus pushing the others each one place down. His illustration of the columns of the three qualities is certainly consis- tent with such an explanation (fig. 2). Doric, on the left, is an extra rich form of ancient Corin- thian, Corinthian, in the middle, has a simpler capital of the same form, while Ionic, on the left, has the characteristic volutes but with some additional elements below to give it the height Filarete demanded of all his capitals. A closer look at theses illustrations enables us to understand more of Filarete's theory of the qualities . He has shed almost entirely the diffe- rentiation by absolutely diverse forms of capitals which was basic for Vitruvius and Alberti. Instead we become more conscious of the relative diffe- rences of height and also of the relative diffe- rences of degree of surface decoration. This last point is particularly important. Ionic has the simplest ornament both on capital and base. Corinthian has richer textures on both elements. Doric has more mouldings on the base, more detailed carving generally and even a deep fluting of the shaft. It had of course been possible to see such relative differences underlying the tradi- tional series of the orders, with Doric being the simplest and Corinthian the richest. But neither Vitruvius nor Alberti had actually thought of them in this wav. This stemmed partly from their acceptance of the mythological explanations of the origins of the orders as imitations of men, matrons and virgins, which laid emphasis on the absolute differences between them. Alberti had in fact gone a little further in the direction of Filarete than Vitruvius, at least in his approach to proportions. While Vitruvius had just quoted the traditional proportions for the three columns as Doric 1:7 diameters and Ionic and Corinthian both 1:9, Alberti had reorganised them into a continuous progression respectively 1:7, 1:8 and 1: 9 4. But Filarete went much farther, extending 3 P. Tigler, Die Architecturtheorie des Filarete, Berlin 1963, 52 and 53. 4 Vitruvius, Ten books of architecture, IV, i and Alberti, De re aedificatoria, IX, vii. 117</page><page sequence="3">such scales to other parts of architecture. In Book Four (fol. 22r) he takes up a remark in Vitruvius that there are three different sizes of bricks and adapts it to mean that there are three different proportions large, medium and small, called Doric, Corinthian and Ionic. Bricks are thus brought into his system of the qualities . So too are openings. In Book Eight (fol. 60r) he gives three proportions for doorways: two squares (1:2), square and a half (1: 1.5) and square and a diameter (1: 1.414 app.). These, he says, are called Doric, Corinthian and Ionic, and although he does not match up the proportions to the names it seems reasonable that as with the columns Doric has the tallest proportion (1:2) and Ionic the lowest (1:1.414). Again he is going a step beyond Alberti in reorganising Vitruvius. The Roman writer had talked of Doric, Ionic and Attic doors, giving the same proportions to the last two. The Florentine humanist had replaced Attic with Corinthian to fit a system of the orders, but had given them all the same proportion of 1 : 2. Filarete also went beyond Alberti by applying his proportions to arched as well as rectangular apertures. It is clear from all these applications that Filarete is concerned to fix architectural forms as Doric, Corinthian or Ionic in terms of their position on two main sliding scales, one of increasing proportion and the other of increasing decoration. We are now closer to understanding why the key to all this is the use of the term qualità. For Vitruvius Doric, Ionic etc., were different genera. This implied that there were absolute and biologically immutable distinctions between them. Such a point of view was natural to someone who knew that the different architec- tural styles so described had grown up separately as the architectures of different Greek tribes. Alberti 's use of the term species also implies a biological distinction if slightly less rigid. But the absolute difference between genus and species , and Filarete s qualità , is best seen in Thomist terms. For Aquinas the two Latin terms both described quidditas as opposed to qualitas. They are absolutes. Qualità is a relative term. Quali- tates fundantur super quantitatem 5. Qualities are measured by quantities. In the present context the quantities are the proportions of bricks, aper- tures and columns and the degree of ornamen- tation on columns, capitals and bases. The term qualità thus takes on a flexibility that the earlier terms did not have. The references of the earlier terms were substantival, an element either was Doric or was not, depending on its origins. The Doric quality on the other hand has an adjectival reference, it can be applied to anything which is either more attenuated or more decorated, whether it be as small as a brick or as large as a palace, regardless of what was Doric in ancient usage. These connotations of qualità are of only underlying importance for Filarete, but there is another function of the word which is of explicit value for him. « Sono più qualità di hedificii come sono più qualità di huomini... » (fol. 48v). « Come sono gli huomini di dignità più uno che un altro , cosi sono gli hedificii secondo da quegli che sono habitad e da che cosa husati... » (fol. 48v). These qualities are in fact parallel, and in the same passage he explains how: just as the offi- ciating clergy in a church is dressed in vestments adorned with gold, silver, pearls and other precious stones, so too the church itself should be decorated with beautiful stones, carvings and paintings. The supreme magnificence of the clergy must be matched by the magnificent archi- tecture of the church. Filarete's appeal to the norms of dress as guides for architectural deco- ration would have been readily understood at the time. The principle that rank in both secular and religious society should be reflected in dress was one of the most widely accepted in fifteenth century Italy and the degree of richness allowed to each class was frequently prescribed by law. Filarete only gives this one example of how clothing and decoration should be matched, but it is presumably the same notion that led him to make the Doric column, as being the most noble, also the most ornate. By making this analogy for the first time Filarete found a simple key by which to decide on the ornaments of any building. Many later writers took up the metaphor of architectural decoration as clothing and it proved extremely fruitful. Its simplicity and comprehensiveness exposes the clumsiness and inadequacy of the theories of Vitruvius and Al- berti who needed to make piecemeal recommen- dations on the suitable decoration of each struc- ture. It would have been difficult for Filarete to have this insight if he had not first chosen as his term for architectural style the word qualità which had long been established as a regular word for social class. For this made it easy for him to see a connection between a building and its occupant in the first place. In Book Eight he explores this connection: « Sono di più qualità ďhuomini come de' gentili i quali appresso i signori per sostegno e per hornamento, gli altri mezzani sono ancora a uti- lità e adornamento , ma non sono pero in ador- namento quanto i gentili. Gli altri più infimi sono a utilità e necessità e servit udine del si- gnore e a bellezza di vista non sono tanto quanto gli altri due superiori » (fol. 56v). It is exactly the same with the different types 5 St. Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on Aristotle Phy- sics, III, v, 1. 118</page><page sequence="4">of columns, Filarete goes on. Doric ones are of maggiore grandezza, Corinthian are della mezza- na and Ionic are come quegli infimi . Thus Ionic should be used where columns have to work hard supporting a heavy weight, Corinthian should also have a load bearing function, and Doric « si mettono a luoghi a dovere sostenere e adornare l'edificio ma non anno si grande fati- cha quanto queste due altre ragioni » fol. 56v). The parallelism between the orders and the classes could not be more precise. The lowest column and the lowest class are both chiefly designed for utility and hardly at all for orna- ment. The highest column and the highest class are both suited for positions requiring maximum elegance and minimum effort. The key to the parallelism lies not only in the use of the word qualità for both but also in the classification into grande , mezzana and piccola . The three columns are explicitly so characterised at fol. 56v and these terms were traditional for differentiating the social classes: « dividesi di nuovo la città negli huomini gran- di, mezzani e piccolini ». It is now clear why both Doric columns and Doric openings have to be tall and thin. They have to be literally higher than the other types. In the same way Ionic has to be low. It is a happy coincidence that the lowness of Ionic also pro- duces a form structurally better able to bear weights. Contemporary practice had actually been moving towards establishing a hierarchy of the columns with the taller and more decorated ones used in the more honourable positions and Al- berti had at one stage characterised traditional Corinthian as lepidus, elegant, in contradistinc- tion to traditional Doric which was ad laborem aptius, but there is no hint of the consistent theory developed here 7. The strength of Filarete's theory resides in its foundation on the simple premise that the forms and relationships found in architecture correspond to and depend on similar forms and relationships in man and so- ciety. Its simple consistency springs from a bril- liantly felicitous choice of terminology which lends constant support to this premise. Its attractiveness is revealed in the way it shows how the forms of classical architecture can be used perfectly to express the norms and conventions of mediaeval society. The significance of Filarete's achievement emerges most clearly if we compare it with Al- berti's attempts to deal with the same problems. Alberti, as I shall show elsewhere, produced only a jumbled and hesitant collection of inconsistent notions on how the use of the orders could be related to particular architectural contexts. His failure was particularly poignant in view of his statement: « de re aedificatoria laus omnium prima est iudicare bene quid deceat » 8. It was apparently a prime concern of Alberti to formulate principles of appropriateness in the choice of architectural forms. Filarete was cert- ainly fortunate in having Alberti 's failures before him to learn from, but the main reason why he succeded where the humanist had failed must lie elsewhere. In view of the importance of his choice of terminology for all elements of his theory it seems certain that the use of his native Italian to formulate his ideas is essential to their consist- ency and clarity. Alberti using his laboriously learned Latin could never attain the same level of instinctive rightness. It was impossible for him to match classical architecture to contemporary society, as he thought about both in different languages: the former in Ciceronian prose and the latter in church Latin or Italian. The vocabu- lary for one world would not fit the other. For Filarete on the other hand no thought was possi- ble that was not expressible in the vulgar tongue. If this meant that he lost some of the nuances of Vitruvius it also meant that inconsistencies and vagueness were kept to a minimum. Seeing eve- rything with the same eye he could see clear correspondences, while Alberti constantly suffe- red from double vision. Of course Filarete was also helped by the fact that he knew he was writing about contem- porary society while Alberti was never really sure. Hence the facility with which he brings in such references as those to the vestments of priests. Hence too the ease with which having once for- mulated his theory he goes on to apply it. At the beginning of Book Eleven he states his intention of designing a house for ciascheduna facultà di persone (fol. 84r). He begins with a palace for a gentilhuomo. The plan is to be of 200 x 100 brac- cia with a main facade on the short side (fig. 3). The door in the centre is to be 4 braccia broad and 8 tall « e cosí tutti i suoi membri verranno proportio- nati a questa misura cioè tutti gli altri usci a due quadri saranno e questi saranno della qua- lità e misura dorica cioè grande. Questo io verché la qualità di chi la possiede secondo l'universale numero delle persone sono def mag- giori ». 6 Chronicle of Dino Compagni of Florence c. 1300 D.L. 151, 4. 7 Alberti, IX, v. 8 Alberti, IX, x. 119</page><page sequence="5">The quality of Doric matches that of a gentleman. His house then should be Doric. Fundamental is the proportion of the groundplan: two squares or 1:2. This had been given earlier as the proportion of the Doric door and is also the proportion of all the openings here. Apparently, we must consi- der it as the proportion of other rectangles in Doric buildings too, whether in plan or elevation. Nor does the Doric quality reveal itself only in these rather rigid formulae. Of the four towers that he puts on top of the palace he says that they are a cosa degnia and that they correspond alla qualità della misura dorica (fig. 4). Presu- mably he means that the gentleman class being the highest and the Doric proportion being consequently the tallest, the tower as the form most clearly expressing height belongs with that qualità. Filarete does not think of Doric as only appropriate to gentlemen on a one-to-one- basis. It is suited to all buildings of a comparable degree of nobility. Though he does not actually use the word Doric, its proportions, that is 1:2 for apertures and plan and 1:9 for columns recur almost exactly in the ducal and episcopal palaces (fig. 5, 6). In the ducal palace described in Book Eight the groundplan is 160x330 br. which is only slightly more attenuated than 1:2. This is the proportion which is explicitly stated to underly the relation between the height of the arch on the facade (12br.) and the height of the whole ground floor (24br.). The palace also uses two sets of columns (or possibly Filarete gives two sets of proportions for the same colon- nade). The proportion of one set is exactly 1:9 (2: 18br.) while that of the other is slightly more attenuated (2Vi x 24br.). The fact that both in groundplan and column height we find propor- tions slightly taller that 1:2 can almost certainly be seen as expressive of the fact that the duke is socially on a level even above the gentleman. The fact that the episcopal palace returns to the normal Doric ratios with a plan 160x320br. and columns of 1 lA x 12 be also draws attention to the unique authority of the duke; though the similarity of absolute measurements of the pala- ces of the secular and religious leaders of the community also emphasises the near equivalence in their positions. The differences between the different Doric buildings on the index of measure- ments are precisely matched by differences in the scale of decoration. Just as the ducal and episco- pal palaces are absolutely larger than the gentle- man's house they are also both adorned with large pilasters on the piano nobile a feature absent from the simpler Doric building. They are also the only two secular buildings on Sforzinda which are raised on three steps. But again, in decoration as in proportion, the superiority of the duke is made quite clear. He has three towers on his facade while the bishop, like the gentle- man, only has two. Filarete's theory of the qua- lities with its flexible indices of proportion and decoration is thus capable, not only of producing an architecture appropriate to a class, but even of articulating differences in status within it. The admirable consistency in the treatment of the Doric quality begins to break up in the exposition of Corinthian and Ionic houses which follows in Book Eleven. These turn out to be the houses of the merchant and artisan classes. But the merchant's house has a ground plan of 50 x 150br. a proportion or 1:3 which is far from the Corinthian 1:1.5 (fig. 7). Instead it is appa- rently the facade of the building which has a proportion only two braccia out underlying its dimensions of 32x50br., while 1:1.5 is specifi- cally said to be the proportion of the main door. A puzzling element is that the windows and inner doors have the Doric ratio. Equally odd are the dimensions of the groundplan of the house of the artisan which should produce the Ionic 1:1.414 but are in reality closer to 1:1.7 (30x50br.). However when Filarete goes on to discuss the house of a poor man the progression toward more stumpy proportions is continued and a plan of ten or twelve foot square is recommended. The poor man's house thus constitutes a sub- Ionic just as the duke's palace is super-Doric. There are no other buildings for which Fi- larete gives the qualities. There is, indeed, only one other building for which he gives enough information for us to establish what quality he intended for it. This is the castle inside Sforzinda described at fol. 38r. The plan is square but the gateways have a proportion of 2:3 (6x9br.) and the columns of an internal portico have a propor- tion of 1:8 (lx8br.). The fact that there is this consistency between the two proportions suggests that they are specifically intended as the attri- butes of the Corinthian quality. There is no compelling reason in the rules why this should be appropriate here. The men-at-arms who occupy the building are not mentioned in the discussion of classes. However, the inference would be that Filarete thought they belonged with the mezzani and in Book Twenty there is a passage that confirms that this is no. In an explanation of the importance of different members of society to their lord he uses the simile of a wall: « Le pietre di fuori grosse che sostengono il muro, che sono l'intagliate, sono e gentiluomi- ni e persone da bene e virtuosi, e le colonne sono i capitani delle genti d'arme. L'altre pietre sono i soldati e le pietre cotte sono il popolo. Il ripieno del muro sono gli huomini di fuori e la crosta sono gli artigiani » (fol. 168v). From this it is clear that men-at-arms come below the gentlemen and above the artisans. Fila- rete's association or them with Corinthian is thus part of a consistent relation of architectural qualities to social classes. 120</page><page sequence="6">So far we have established the general principles of Filareťs theory and have also seen how he visualised its application in the buildings of a Renaissance city. Unfortunately we do not have actual structures by his hand which realise his vision. Yet there is one building of central importance for the history of Renaissance archi- tecture which seems to take inspiration from his ideas. The Palazzo della Cancelleria was built in Rome twenty years after Filarete finished his Treatise in Milan, and there io no direct link be- tween it and the Florentine architect. There are, however, a considerable number of common ele- ments between it and Filarete's Doric house. Although not completely regular the plan consists basically of an approximately square palace with a square garden behind it, like the gentlemans palace of the Treatise. The irregularity of the palace is apparently necessitated by the street plan as the layout can easily be reduced to a square by shortening the facade and lengthening the rear wall to give them the same length as the present Corso facade. All the walls would then join at right angles to form the four sides of a square. The thickening of the interior, as well as the exterior walls of the corner rooms proves that the building was also originally intended to have four towers, although documents only refer to the construction of one in 1489. The palace was also built around two oblong courts, one larger than the other. All these are features which are found in Filarete's Doric house and which it wold be difficult to parallel in this combi- nation alsewhere. But if we look more closely we find trat the correspondences are not so simple. The palace court and the church of S. Lorenzo in Damasco which was also built into the palace both have a Doric order. However, it is not the rich Doric of Filarete but the austere version of Vitruvius and Alberti. The capitals are simple and low decorated with geometrical mouldings (fig. 8). Also when we compare the type of order found in the church with that in the palace court we find that the church, which we would have expected from Fila- rete to have the richer and more refined decora- tion as being the nobler structure, has in fact the opposite attributes. The nave is lined by the simplest of square piers of stumpy proportions, while the palace court has slender columns with carved bases and capitals, except in the corners where there are piers like those in the church though still taller. The same difference is found in the proportion of their plans. The nave of church has a proportion of 1 : 1 ,5 while that of the palace court is more elongated at 1: 1,65. The more the details of the complex are studied the more it is apparent that it is constructed on principles wich are the converse or Filarete's, yet so preci- sely the converse that they must be connected with his. There are rich classical Corinthian forms in the building but they are restricted to its least important parts, the external facade and the top- most storey of the court. The lower two orders of the court, always the most important part of the fifteenth century palace, are Doric as we saw. It is noticeable that the Corinthian elements have the weakest and most slender columnar form, the pilaster, while the Doric elements have the stronger forms of column and pier. The same contrast exists between the windows of the less important top floor and the more important first (fig. 10). Those of the top floor have a proportion of 1:2 and those of the first floor are of 1:1,5 which makes them lower and stronger. Although on the facade both are in areas decorated with Corinthian pilasters the lower windows are given Doric mouldings so that the association of the low proportion and Doric continues. Another point of difference between the two windows is that the taller form is also rectangular, hile the shorter Doric window is arched. If it is remem- bered that all the other Doric openings of the pala- ce and church are also arched while the Corin- thian pilasters support a horizontal architrave it becomes almost certain that the arch is regarded as appropriate to Doric being the stronger structu- ral form while the weaker flat top is appropriate to the weakness of Corinthian. Once again it is relevant to turn to Filarete. At fol.óOr he has an illustration of two types of opening and they represent exactly the contrast that exists in the windows of the Cancelleria (fig. 11). The upper is rectangular, has the proportion of 1:2 and a rich decoration of mouldings. The lower is much simpler and has an arched top supported by piers. Its proportion of 1:1,414 is not identical to the 1: 1,5 of the palace, but is close to it and represents in any case the lowest proportion allo- wed by Filarete. It thus seems likely that the association of the arch with stump proportions and simple forms in contrast to a flat top linked with lofty proportions and richer decoration was already found in the Treatise before it appears on our building, only the valuation put on the two sets of characteristics was completely the reverse. Although there are a number of elements which cannot be fitted into the scheme of the pa- lace as it has emerged so far, such as the small windows which appear above the main windows on both floors, they are not significant enough to throw doubt on the main conclusions. Indeed such details as the small windows may have been introduced at a late stage in the palace's extended building history. As we saw in the case of the towers, major departures from the perfection of the original plan were admitted already in 1489. Some inconsistencies were inevitable, such as the placing of a Doric window between Corinthian pilasters on first floor of the facade. The windows are intended to show the relative importance of 121</page><page sequence="7">1. The orders from Serlio, Libro Quarto, Venice 1537. 2. The columnar qualità. Filarete fol. 57 v. 3.

Filarete fol. 60 r. the rooms on the main floor, while the pilasters are to show the inferiority of the facade as against the court. In broad lines the scheme is quite consistent. The private upper parts of the palace have Corinthian forms associated with the pro- portion of 1:2; the main reception areas below, the first floor rooms and the court, as well as the church, have chiefly Doric forms associated with the proportion of 1: 1,5. Within the Doric area the church has the pure Doric proportion in its plan and the more austere piers as supports while the richer, slenderer columns of the palace and the more elongated proportion of the court illustrate the inferiority of the secular to the spiritual as clearly as the inferiority of private to public was shown within the palace itself. The whole scheme relies on an opposition between Doric and Corinthian which is almost identical to that bet- ween Doric and Corinthian in Filarete, but classi- cal Doric has now acquired the attributes Filarete gave to Corinthian and classical Corinthian takes back to itself the forms and proportions that Filarete had mistakenly given to Doric. Although Doric and Corinthian retain the values they had for Filarete of more and less importance, there is a complete inversion of their attributes. In general, simplicity and strength have usurped the dignity previously attaching to richness and ele- gance. In detail, Filarete's Doric proportion is now precisely that of Corinthian and his Corin- thian precisely that of Doric. Considering that the whole idea of using scales of ornament and proportion like this was Filarete's invention, and that not only does the palace conform in type to his gentleman's residen- ce but that the specific proportions considered significant by him recur, it seems certain that the genesis of the palace must have been influenced by his Treatise. Fortunately we can probably be sure of how Cardinal Riario, the builder of the palace, had access to such a rare work. In Februa- ry 1483 Lorenzo de' Medici lent his copy to be co- pied for the Cardinal of Aragon. Apparently it was sent to Rome. For it was to be returned to Lorenzo's representative in that city in 1489 9. The Treatise would thus have arrived at the papal court in the very year in which Cardinal Riario was appointed commendatory of S. Lorenzo in Damasco. The Cardinal could certainly have stu- died it by the time he destroyed the old church and adjoining palace in 1485 preparatory to re- building the whole area. It is impossible to know whether his architect, whoever he was, joined him in his researches. This period was one of great interest in architectural theory, particularly in the circle of Riario. In 1485 Alberti's De Re Aedifi- catoria was published and in 1486 appeared the Ten Books of Vitruvius. The dedication of the 9 For dating and documents see A. Schiavo, Il Palazzo della Cancelleria, Rome 1964, passim. 126</page><page sequence="12">latter was to Cardinal Riario and it praised him for his interest in the revival of the ancient thea- tre. Interest in Filarete in particular is demonstra- ted not only by the loan to the Cardinal of Aragon but also by the translation made for Matthias Corvinus of Hungary between 1484 and 1490 10. In this context Riario's debt to Filarete is not surprising. Neither Alberti nor Vitruvius could give him such clear guidance on how to design a palace appropriate to his dignity. The problem remains of why the Cardinal went only so far in following the instructions of the Treatise and actually contradicted it in essen- tial points. Here the influence of the competing sources has to be taken into account. The publi- cation of Vitruvius with Riario's backing proves his concern for scholarly accuracy, and a reading of that text would have shown him that Filarete's description of Doric was wrong. Once he had established that Doric was the simplest and stron- gest of the orders and that Corinthian was in fact the richest it woud have been possible to let Filarete's detailed recommandations stand and just assume that he had made an error in the ap- plication of the terms Corinthian and Doric. This would have fitted well with architectural usage as the elegant and ornate forms of Corin- thian were traditional in the palaces of the rich and the noble. That he chose in fact to keep to Filarete's names but use opposite forms and pro- portions suggests either that he attached particu- lar importance to the term Doric itself or that the simple forms and low proportions were fitted better into his scale of values. It is possible that he was affected by both factors, and there is evidence that might both be linked. A reading of Vitruvius, apart from helping Riario to indentify Doric, would also have shown him how the cha- racter of Corinthian was feminine, even girlish, both by virtue of its origin and because its use was recommended in temples to virgin deities 11 . This would hardly make Corinthian forms appro- priate to a palace, still less to a church inscribed on the front TEMPLŮM DIVI LAURENTIO MAR- TIRI DICATUM. Although these words occur as part of a commemorative inscription running the facade of the whole building the sentence is so phrased that they come almost exactly at the entrance to the church. The idea of having such an iscription in the main architrave and particu- larly the use of the term templům can only be intended to stress the analogy with classical usa- ge. It would thus be not surprising if in this ar- chaeological frame of mind Riario chose to apply the Vitruvian rule which stated that Doric should be used for temples to Mars, Hercules and other virile gods propter virtutem, because of their manly virtue 12. Hercules and St. Lawrence were long thought to have something in common. S. Lo- renzo at Milan was said to have been a rebuilt temple of Mars. If he had good reason for thin- king that Doric was appropriate for his church he may well have liked to think that his palace should be Doric for the same reason, especially as his title, also given in the iscription, was SANCTI GIORGII DIACONUS, and he would certainly aspire to virtus. Such an argument from Vitru- vius may have been compelling, but because it involved upsetting an established scale of values with richness at the top he probably would only have accepted it if he could satisfy himself that a scale of values which elevated simplicity and strength was really more admirable. In fact all the philosophers of antiquity who were most wi- dely admired, Cicero, Aristotle and Plato could have led him to this view. The most compelling passages would have been those in which Aristotle and Plato stated their preference for the Dorian mode of music because of its robust manly qua- lity 13. Unfortunately all this is supposition, but some considerations like these must have been responsible for Riario's modification of essential parts of Filarete's recommandations. Though I cannot demonstrate it for Riario, I will show elsewhere that these texts were used by others in exactly this way at about the same time. In any case the Cancelleria is a watershed in Renaissance architecture. It might have been the perfect expression of Filarete's theories and the traditional values they were designed to embody, values which were nowhere more important than in the Christian Church. In reality it was the ful- filment of a classical ideal, one deriving in detail from Vitruvius and in priciple from the stream of ascetic philosophy. Its importance can be measured by the fact that before it all palaces and churches employed variations on the rich Corinthian capital for their major elements and after it, particularly in Rome, most palaces and some churches, even including Bramante's first project for St Peter's, employed sober Doric instead. If it had represented a watershed only in the use of such decorative elements, however, its importance for the history of architecture would have been very limited. But the shift in value systems underlying this change has much deeper consequences. It was noted that, in the Cancelleria complex, Doric was associated with the use of heavy piers and arch forms while Corinthian was used in conjunction with weak pilasters and hori- zontal lintels and entablatures. In other words the change of order is linked with a complete change of structural system. Not only does an architectu- 10 The piers of the church are similar to those in the corners of the court illustrated in fig. 9 except that they are lower and have a simple rectangular plan. 11 Tigler, 9. 12 Ibid. 13 Vitruvius, I, ii. 127</page><page sequence="13">re wich relies on the arch and the pier have a quite different appearance from an architecture based on the pilaster and horizontal entablature, it has quite different static potentialities. The Do- ric architecture of the Cancelleria was designed to express strength not only by using the strongest order but also by using the strongest structural system. Of course the type of structure that the massive piers and arches of S. Lorenzo in Damasco replaced was not one of pilasters and horizontal architraves but one of columns and arches, such as that still used in fact in the Cancelleria court. But the contrast between pier and arch, and column and arch has just as dramatic implica- tions. Slender columns can only support thin arches and thin arches can only support insub- stantial walls. In fact structural needs such as the desire to use vaulting had already led archi- tects to reject the simple columns of Brunelleschi in favour of variations of the pier form. Alberti had been one of themosi prominent architects taking this step, as in S. Andrea, but he still re- jected the arch and pier in his De Re Aedificatoria claiming they were unworthy of sacred edificies. Hence the importance of the Cancelleria. There the pier and arch appear not as an unfortunate structural necessity but as the basic vehicle of expression of a new scale of values. It may be argued that the use of the column and arch in the palace court shows some lack of conviction in applying the new system. But I believe those ele- ments are only employed in order to allow the church's greater dignity to emerge more clearly. This would be confirmed by the court of the Pa- lazzo Giraud-T orlonia probably designed by the same architect as the Cancelleria in 1499. For there the pier and arch are used in all their magni- ficent sobriety. The forms of this palace are in- deed too dry to form the basis of a new style. It was left to the architects of the next generation to create the new architecture embodying the new values of strength and simplicity bat with a greater richness of range. The most prominent of these architects was Bramante and the most si- gnificant cantribution to the new style was St Peters with its arches piers and vaults. From the architecture of Filarete to that of the High Renaissance may seem a long journey. The elegant ornaments he favoured find their antithesis in the robust structures of Bramante. But it is important that in the Ionic architecture of his lowest social class he had already conceived of such an antithesis. Admittedly for Filarete the simplicity and strength of his Ionic had been intended to match the physical attributes of the most insignificant members of the community, while the High Renaissance architects chose Doric ti fit the moral values of an intellectual elite. But in both cases the basic underlying no- tion is that the style of a person's house should express his quality and it was Filarete who first formulated how this might be done. His careful demonstration of the anthropomorphic basis of architecture, and particularly his insistence on the parallelism between clothing and architectural de- coration and on the correspondence between so- cial and architectural qualità, enabled him to establish a coherent scale of architectural styles. Architecture thus acquired a dimension of expression previously restricted to music and rhe- toric. This had been the goal of architects down the ages, whether unconciously, as in most cases, or consciously as in the cases of Vitruvius and Alberti. Their failures help us to measure his success. But perhaps his success is best seen in the way his scale of architectural styles included one to satisfy the new values of the next gene- ration of architects as well as his own. When an- cient moral qualities became more important than mediaeval social ones for the building clas- ses in Rome his scale was just as apposite as it had been for the Milanese court. It only needed to be inverted. Riario's palace showed how this could be done. 14 Ibid . is Plato, Rep. 398 and Aristotle, Pol. VIII, 7. Riferimenti fotografici. Da B.
