<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS_ The (bio)diversity of science reflects the interests of society John RU Wilsonl*, $erban Prochel, Brigitte Braschler2'l, Edd S Dixon', and David M Richardson' For ecologists to develop robust generalizations and principles, a broad taxonomic and geographic spread of research is required, but, in practice, most generalizations are based on the research of individual scientists and groups, and their choice of study organism is affected by many different factors. We analyzed researchers' choice to assess potential biases. In particular, by comparing the relative representation of species in the scien tific literature and on the Internet, we explored how the choice of study organism is influenced by societal inter ests. While there is a strong positive correlation between output in the scientific literature and on the web, devi ations from this general pattern suggest that, when compared with societal biases, research agendas are more directly influenced by economic priorities and practical limitations, and less by geographical and sociopolitical barriers. Although the range of biological research reflects the needs of society, there are still large taxonomic and geographic gaps. By focusing on specific groups, we are developing an in-depth knowledge of certain taxa, but if ecologists are to develop generalizations, we may need to widen our research scope. Front Ecol Environ 2007; 5(8): 409-414, doi:10.1890/060077.01 Recently, researchers have suggested that a reassess ment of the current taxonomic and geographical focus of biodiversity research is needed (Hendriks et al. 2006; Loreau et al. 2006). A clear aim of scientific research is objectivity, but, while research itself may be objective, there are subjective biases in the choice of research topics. Research agendas and the interests of sci entists are affected by society. Understanding how research goals are biased by public interest may help us to identify under-funded, but potentially fruitful, areas of research. Scientists and scientific journals are often evaluated using the number and impact of their publications (Cameron 2005; Hirsch 2005), while journalists and politicians use web pages to gauge public interest in a topic. Although there are concerns surrounding the use of web statistics, the Internet per se is becoming an important source of data for analysis and science evalua tion (Ball 2006). Web pages and scientific articles there fore offer an opportunity to explore the relationship between what biologists work on and what the wider public is interested in. In this context, the scientific names of species are particularly suitable, as they are unambiguous, are the same in every language, and are widely used by non-scientists, including gardeners, bird watchers, and journalists. Here, we examine several factors that may affect which organism a researcher chooses to study - taxonomy, conservation, geographic location, and economics - 'Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University, Matieland 7602, South Africa *(john.wil son2@gmail.com); 2Biodiversity and Macroecology Group, Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield SI0 2TN, UK and explore how much of this decision may be due to underlying societal biases (Figure 1). The approach taken may be useful in other analyses (eg the role of gender and cultural context in research). a Potential societal biases in the choice of research subject Different groups of organisms attract different amounts of human interest for a variety of reasons. People tend to like organisms with anthropomorphic features (Morris 1967) and to dislike pests and parasites. Both sympathy and antipathy lead to increased public awareness, and sci entific research is likely to reflect these patterns. It has been argued that the publication process is similarly biased against "unconventional" or "unpopular" organ isms, as researchers are most interested in articles dealing with their own study organisms (Bonnet et al. 2002). We examined such effects using invasive alien species (IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group 2000), as these species come from several taxonomic groups, but share at least one feature that attracts the interest of humans. The value placed on species can rest on emotive issues, especially when it comes to conservation (Sagoff 1996; Carvell et al. 1998). We examined how people respond to species of conservation concern using the IUCN Red List for mammals (Wilson and Reeder 1993; IUCN Species Survival Commission 2006). There are also major geographical differences in access to information technology (Guillen and Suarez 2005), and in the concentration of research effort (Gaston and May 1992). Does the digital divide in Internet usage reflect academic biases? To examine geographic patterns, we used a list of bats (chiropterans; Wilson and Reeder 1993) as they are a widely distributed, mobile group that C The Ecological Society of America www.frondersinecology.org</page><page sequence="2">The (bio)diversity of science JRU Wilson et al. Figure 1. What should we work on? shows a latitudinal pattern in species richness common to many taxa (ie high richness in the tropics, declining toward the poles; Proche? 2005). We also compared a list of names of European butterflies (Fauna Europaea Web Service 2004) with a list of names of North American butterflies (Opler et al. 2003) to contrast two of the main areas of scientific publication and web use (May 1997; O'Neill et al. 2003; King 2004). Finally, we examined the extent to which economic importance inflates both public awareness and research activity. To explore this, we examined agricultural produc tion (total world production in megatons averaged over the past 3 years; UN 2006) using a list of common food plants (USDA-ARS National Genetic Resources Program 2006). * Methods We estimated the number of scientific publications using Thompson's ISI Web of Science database (http:flisiweb ofknowledge.com) and the number of web pages using Google (www.google.com). Web of Science has extensive coverage of life science journals, while Google has a rela tively large database of indexed web pages (Notess 2006). We regressed the number of web pages on the number of scientific articles and analyzed which factors affected this relationship (eg taxonomic grouping). The same qualita tive results were returned if the number of web pages was used to explain the number of scientific articles. Estimates of the number of web pages containing species' scientific names were extracted from Google. For the purposes of this study, all results returned by Google were used - this included HTML documents, unindexed URLs, and web accessible documents (eg PDFs) - and are referred to as web pages. The SafeSearch filtering was turned off, pages from any language were allowed, and 100 results were displayed per page. The datum captured was the estimated number of web pages returned, as it appeared in the top right corner of the screen. The num bers of scientific articles containing species' scientific names were obtained in a similar manner from Web of Science (only articles published since 1995 were considered, so that the datasets obtained from Web of Science and Google covered similar time periods). Measures of scientific output were also obtained from ISI CAB Abstracts (number of articles) and Google Scholar (web pages representing a mix of sources). Species names were entered as single search terms (ie in inverted commas). All search terms were combined, randomized, and searched on Web of Science and Google on 28-29 January 2006, ensuring that variation due to temporal changes was minimized. In all cases, the search term was the full bino mial name of a species. We identified several difficulties in using the search engines' estimates of the number of relevant articles or web pages; however, we developed some relatively simple solutions and identified poten tial areas for future research (WebTable 1). To estimate the level of non-independence between Web of Science and web pages returned by Google, we manu ally searched through web pages. Using a sub-sample of 100 names from the invasive species list, we extracted the first 1000 web page summaries from Google and counted the number of direct references to a scientific publication. In a few cases, a high proportion of web pages returned for a given search term referred directly to a scientific article (median 11%, maximum 76%), but when tested, this variation did not explain the observed patterns (ANOVA, F4,96 = 1.42, P = 0.23). There was also no significant correlation between page rank and the likelihood that a page referred directly to a scientific publication. As a further check that our methodology does not simply examine scientific web pages, the first 500 web pages returned by Google for nine invasive species were viewed and categorized according to the degree to which the author and the intended audience were part of a specialist group (WebTable 2). We found that many (30-80%) web pages containing the scientific names of species have little or nothing to do with scientific research, and therefore, that there was sufficient variation with which to explore differences in frequency of scientific and non-scientific web pages. * Results As expected, there was a broad log-linear correlation between the number of web pages and the number of sci entific articles, with 10 to 1000 web pages per scientific article for the species investigated (r = 0.64). However, the deviations from this pattern proved to be interesting and have potentially important implications. www.frontiersinecology.org e The Ecological Society of America</page><page sequence="3">JRU Wilson et al. The (bio)diversity of science Taxonomic biases For the invasive species we examined (IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group 2000), the number of web pages relative to scientific articles was affected by broad taxonomic groupings (ANOVA, F2,21 = 62.3, P &lt; 0.01; Figure 2; WebTable 3a). In particular, invasive inverte brates had a high scientific presence relative to web presence. There was also a strong taxonomic bias in the scientific content of web pages. Of the web pages examined in detail, around half of the pages referring to invasive vertebrates were authored by scientists, compared to almost three quarters for invertebrates, and only a third for plants (out of a sample of 500 web pages per species; WebTable 4). About one in three pages on vertebrates was authored by the general public (the highest for any group), while the general pub lic authored less than a tenth of all web pages on invertebrates. This shows that, although it may be easier to publish research on taxa in which the public is interested (Bonnet et al. 2002), the less fashionable invasive invertebrates are receiving relatively more scientific attention than the high profile invasive vertebrates or plants. Importantly, however, invasive vertebrates do still tend to have more web pages and scientific articles than either invasive invertebrates or plants (WebTable 3b), suggesting a taxonomic bias in both research output (F2,322 = 46.07, P &lt; 0.01) and web presence (F2,322 = 25.3, P &lt; 0.01). Conservation status The relationship between a species' web presence and sci entific presence was affected by conservation status, with mammal species of higher conservation concern tending to have a higher web presence (Figure 3). This general result was consistent when analysis was restricted to narrower tax onomic groupings (eg primates or carnivores). Common species may be studied because they are abundant and easy to collect, while the study of endangered species has many practical limitations and special ethical concerns. In con trast, the natural fascination of the general public with rare and endangered species is much less dependent on species' abundances. As a trite example, there are many web sites written about dodos, but few scientific papers (Figure 1). Geographical patterns We found that bat species with larger geographic ranges had relatively more web pages than scientific articles (ANOVA, F1,915 = 54.5, P &lt; 0.01), and, when including range size in the analysis, there was a broad north-south pattern, with northern temperate bats being relatively overrepresented on the web (Figure 4). Tropical Africa, in comparison with other tropical regions, has a very low web use and a low representation on the Internet 100~~~~ Mw ~~~mus uli --.

Therre are taxonomic differences in the prominence of a species in the scientfi literature relative to its prominence on the Interet. More web pa~ges per scetfcatcle refer to invasive plants than vertebrates and to vertebrates thian invertebrates (see WebTable 3a) . The labeled outiers are a few species generally used as pets or ornaments (Felis catus, Berberis thungbergii), of economic imprtane (Salmo salar, Coptotermes formosanus), of laboratory use (Xenopus Iaevis), or i ntforseveralreasons (Mus musculus). The list of invasive speiaes is from the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group (2000). (Miniwatts Marketing Group 2006). Consequently, the research output for African bats appears inflated (although the scientists studying African and other tropi cal organisms may be based in North America or Europe). Differences between Europe and North America were also apparent. North American butterflies had a relatively higher web presence than European butterflies (F31202 = 220, P &lt;0.01). This may be partially explained by comparing total scientific output with total web use. While the two regions had a similar share of scientific publications over the time span examined here (May 1997; King 2004), they differ in Internet usage. Sixty-eight percent of North American adults use the Internet, compared with 47% of Europeans (as at October 2005; Anonymous 2005; European Commission 2006), and in 2002, the contents of 55% of all public web sites originated in the US (O'Neill et al. 2003). Such geographic patterns are probably also affected by biases in favor of the English language in Google (O'Neill et al. 2003) and in Web of Science (Cameron 2005). This may lead to an overrepresentation of species from English-speaking countries on both Google and Web of Science. However, from the analyses of agricultural out put and range size in bats and butterflies, it appears that the digital divide (Guillen and Suarez 2005) is larger than geographic biases in the choice of study organisms. Agrcultural research reflects patterns of production We found that agricultural production was much more strongly correlated to the number of scientific articles ?

Different letters show statistically significant groups from pair-wise comparisons (t tests, P &lt; 0.05 after sequential Bonferroni correction). To allow for the constraints of normality and to produce a continuous distribution of species with reliable information, only species with between 10 and 1000 scientific articles in Web of Science are included. However, a similar pattern is observed if species with fewer than 10 articles are analyzed using tests that assume discrete distributions. than the number of web pages (Google, r2 = 0.1 1, 95% CI after 100 000 bootstraps = 0.01-0.23; Web of Science, 0.38, 0.23-0.53; Google Scholar, 0.39, 0.24-0.54; CAB Abstracts, 0.48, 0.32-0.63). These correlations might be stronger if economic values are considered, as there were relatively more web pages and scientific articles per unit production of herbs and spices (like pepper, Piper nigrum) than for heavier crops (like watermelons, Citrullus lana tus), but the closer correlation between agricultural pro duction and scientific articles (than between production and web pages) does highlight the practical and eco nomic focus of research. A geographic bias was also evident in these data. Small volume, traditionally European and North American crops like gooseberries, quince, and medlar had a low presence in the scientific literature, but a relatively high web presence. Conversely, tropical crops such as taro (Colocasia esculenta) had a very low web presence relative to the amount of science conducted, and indeed a very low absolute web or scientific presence, considering that taro is the staple food crop for many human societies. In countries with a high web presence, the number of web pages relative to scientific articles may also reflect cul tural importance. Plants like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) have arguably influenced European cultural history more than is sug gested by their present economic value. * Discussion The Internet as a means of communicating ecology Our project highlighted some important general issues that need to be considered when working with ecological web pages: (1) information generally flows from researchers and practitioners to the general public (WebTable 4), and there appear to be rela tively few web forums where members of the public have a chance to discuss issues with scientists and practitioners; (2) there are major limitations of web statistics, and, when used out of context, these numbers can be very misleading, even when the intention is to provide a broad picture; (3) the full scien tific names of relevant subject species should be included close to the top of a web page, to facilitate searching and to distinguish species with the same common name; (4) finally, misspellings are surprisingly common, and limit the potential audience of a web page and its value as an information source. Which species should we work on? If a purely practical view is taken, then research goals should follow societal needs and interests. Agricultural species, pests, invasive species, and diseases would be studied because they have direct economic con sequences, and "cute" animals would be studied because they elicit a public response. If a taxonomically objective view is taken, then the research conducted should reflect the diversity of the groups under investigation. Research would be evenly spread across the tree of life with at least one or two representative taxa investigated from each major lade, and perhaps some pre-eminence given to ancient lineages or particularly novel evolutionary inno vations in body plan or biochemistry. The reality, of course, lies somewhere between these two extremes and is strongly influenced by practical limitations. People do tend to work on economically important species (eg for agriculture), species whose ranges overlap or lay near to their physical location (geographic biases), and those that are big, endangered, in some way sensational, or have anthropomorphic features (taxonomic biases). Research funding and researchers The patterns produced are the indirect result of how research goals are set and funded. Despite the status given www.frontersinecology-org i The Ecological Society of America</page><page sequence="5">JRU Wilson et al. The (bio)diversity of science to national academies and govern mental research institutes, to some extent market forces determine which species are studied. Much research funding comes from com mercial partnerships, research foun dations, and special interest groups. This may be the most cost-effective way of funding research, but it may also lead to biases in our collective view of the world. Scientists, of course, are not pas sive in this process. Cultural upbring ing and education affect which species people want to study, which research is favored, and therefore, indirectly, how biologists view biodi versity and ecological processes. For example, conservation biology is viewed primarily from the macro scopic viewpoint of a large mammal. Consequently, we rarely consider the observation that the loss of all macro scopic organisms would mean a small loss ot total phylogenetic diversity (Nee 2005). The need for taxonomic breadth Research focused on less studied taxa would help to demonstrate the generality of ecological theory and pat tern, and increase the probability of discovering novelty. The study of ecological processes that occur belowground has produced valuable insights in many areas of biology, and it is no coincidence that this is one of the fastest growing areas of ecology (Baskin 2005). The historical lack of research on belowground factors may have been due partly to the fact that belowground processes are dif ficult to study, but we would argue it was also because, for many people, grubbing around in the dirt has less appeal than bird watching. Research often generates more research and certain species and groups are held up as models. There are 16358 articles in Web of Science from the past 10 years on Drosophila melanogaster, but only 143 articles on Drosophila subobscura, and 142 on other genera in the Drosophilidae. This is natural, but it becomes increas ingly easy and productive to build on previous research, and more expensive, in terms of developing a critical mass of knowledge and brain-power, to broaden our knowledge to other groups. In many cases, widening our understanding involves repeating similar work already performed on other species, and this work is neither novel nor exciting enough for publication in top journals. If we restrict ourselves to traditionally studied groups, or to the chase for prestigious papers (Grace 2007), then we really may be missing opportunities. A discussion 'I I I I I I.

Note that the patterns observed show where the study species are found and not where the researchers who study them are based. should take place among government granting agencies, the scientific community, and society about the setting of research priorities with regard to taxonomic bias. a Conclusions The Internet provides a rich source of information that was not previously available to ecologists, giving researchers and practitioners a new means of assessing and sharing their experiences. Similarly, the web gives members of the general public an opportunity to conduct a discourse with the ecological community, even to the extent of setting research goals. This is an opportunity that has not yet been fully utilized and one that we feel could be particularly fruitful in engaging society with ecological issues. It is clear from our results that the choice of research subject in biology reflects the interests of society. Where there are differences, scientific output appears to be defined more by economic and practical concerns and less by geographical bias than are societal interests, as revealed by online patterns. However, it is also clear that certain groups and certain geographical regions receive far more attention than others. National academies do try to push for breadth as well as depth in research. The suc cess of this process, however, needs to be assessed, and perhaps more focus should be placed on filling taxonomic gaps. For example, the number of fungal ecologists proba bly doesn't reflect the importance of fungi in ecosystem functioning, but rather established patterns of research. Similarly, wildlife management and teaching should con sciously include less studied groups. Taxonomic breadth should not be limited to taxonomists. ?
