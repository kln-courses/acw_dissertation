The instrumentalist, who is at the same time the “singer of tales”,1 is called lahutar [fig. 1]. The particular status of the instrument, inside and outside of the geographical areas where it is used, is closely related to the unique significance which the songs it accompanies have become for the cultural distinctiveness of the Albanians. This process begun at the end of the nineteenth century, an important period of struggle for the country’s independence achieved in 1912. Since that time, the meaning of this repertoire for the local communities and the making of the instru- ment into the national symbol have been continuously mingled. The different ways these opposites have evolved can be discerned through the diverse connotations the lahutë has become through them. Features of these connotations and their impact in the perception of the instrument will be examined by focusing on the terminology related to the songs and the instrument, the special meaning some parts of the instrument have become for the involved communities, the ways the lahutë has been presented in public spaces in more than a century, as well as on current tendencies concerning perspectives of its appearances in local practices and on public stages. THE DESIGNATIONS OF THE SONGS ACCOMPANIED BY LAHUTË. Insights into the repertoire and its impact make possible to observe its significance for the communities on one side and researchers and the media on the other. While names which communities assign to the repertoire are closely connected with the narratives presented in the lyrics, with the performance practice, or with the place which these songs occupy in every- day life, names assigned by the researchers and media often reflect the meaning attributed to the songs on the basis of their comparisons with related repertoires in different periods of time, different areas and in different languages. Central in the Albanian epic repertoire are songs about the brothers Muji and Halili who possess super- natural qualities. One of the most used designations by the communities, researchers and media is therefore expectedly “këngët e Mujit e Halilit” (songs of Muji and Halili). In the research and media the term “këngë” (songs) is used for this repertoire predominantly since the Congress of Albanian Orthography (Kongresi i Drejtshkrimit të Gjuhës Shqipe) held in 1972, when was standardized the official Albanian language (shqipja zyrtare).2 The dialectal designation is written since that time “kangë”, while in publications of the first half of the twentieth century it used to be written “kângë”, emphasizing the nasal sound (â) in the dialect called gegnisht. This dialect is spoken by gegë Albanians, who live primarily north of the river Shkumbin in Albania, in Kosovo, north of the Ohrid Lake in Macedonia, in Montenegro and in Serbia. The songs about Muji and Halili are practiced by gegë Albanians living mostly north of the Drin River3 and in a much lower intensity to the south. What is more, the practice of these songs is reduced demonstrably since the 1980s,4 even though they and the lahutë still have very important representative character. © 2013 Research Center for Music Iconography CUNY 145 </page> <page sequence="3"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism 2.

Bernardin Palaj and Donat Kurti mentioned in the second volume of the series Visaret e Kombit (Treasures of the nation)—the most important publication of the first half of the twentieth century concerning the local traditions among the Albanians—three other terms for these songs which are still locally used: “kângë kresh- nikësh”, “kângë të moçme”, and “kângë lahute”.5 The first one is often translated into English as “songs of the frontier warriors”, as for example in the title of the edition of Albanian songs in the English translation by Robert Elsie and Janice Mathie-Heck, published in 2004: Songs of the Frontier Warriors/Këngë Kreshnikësh.6 The two other terms may be translated as “ancient songs” for kângë të moçme and “lahutë songs” for kângë lahute. The last designation, which is used in the everyday life much more frequently is the term “kangë me lahutë” (songs with lahutë) which emphasizes the importance of the accompanying instrument primarily in terms of the way how the songs exist, rather than in terms of the performance practice. Another term for these songs is “kangë Agajsh të Jutbinës” (songs of the agas from Jutbinë), where “Jutbinë” has been identified “as a geographic region comprising Lika and Krbava valleys, to the east of Zadar in Croatia, not far from the present Bosnian border.”7 The term “aga”, used mostly as a honoriphic for a civilian or military officer in the Ottoman Empire, is an indication of the Ottoman influence on the songs. The Albanian epics also include legends like the “kanga e Gjergj Elez Alisë” (the song of Gjergj Elez Alia) who was victorious against the awful black Baloz (Balozi i zi), or “kanga e Ago Ymerit” (the song of Ago Ymeri) evolving around the motive of reunification of husband and wife. 146 </page> <page sequence="4"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) 3.

The terms “kângë”, “kangë”, and “këngë” have been and still are used for these songs in the research and media as often as the term “rapsodi” (rhapsody) for the ancient Greek Õαψåδία. The term “rapsodi” is used in the Albanian research and media at least since the edition Visaret e Kombit, published in 1937,8 although iÕt doαψåes not appear in the local terminology. It is all the more striking that its derivation “rapsod” (from Greek,δός) for “rhapsode” or “rhapsodist” is used in the everyday life. In fact, under the influence of the media, “rapsod” is at the present time among the Albanians called any well-known singer who becomes a representative of a local practice or of a specific repertoire. In many cases a “rapsod” (usually man) enriches the repertoire by creating new songs. From this viewpoint it is not surprising that the communities still habi- tually use the term “lahutar” to designate singers of epic songs rather than “rapsod”. Very frequently used are in the research and media the terms “epic” and “epos” (in Albanian, “epikë” and “epos”), but they are neglected in the local practice. The same is to be told about the term “Cikli i Mujit dhe Halilit” (the cycle of Muji and Halili), which the lahutarë do not use. As far as the name of the instrument is concerned, the only term known for it is “lahutë”. The instrument is made of one piece of wood with a skin soundboard, and the etymological relation of its name with the term “lute” seems obvious, although no research has been undertaken on this subject. It is important to emphasize that lahutë is considered by the lahutarë to be in their musical practice an old instrument, and by all means older than other instruments with which they used to accompany historical songs. Two of them are the long- necked lutes sharkı and çifteli, which are regarded new instruments, meaning used over the last two or three hundred years.  147 </page> <page sequence="5"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism 4. Odhise Paskali, with Janaq Paço and Andrea Mano. Skan- derbeg’s statue in the center of Tiranë (1968). How much the categorization of lahutë as an old instrument in this practice is related to the idea that the songs it accompanies are old is still a question to be investigated. In this context it is remarkable that in some cases the lahutarë relate the instrument to the image of Skanderbeg (1405–1468), the resistance fighter against the Ottoman Turks and the Albanian national hero, although he does not appear to be subject of these songs. LAHUTË ME SKËNDERBEG (LAHUTË WITH SKANDERBEG). For our discussion is particularly important the form of the scroll curved on the neck of lahutë, which could be made in the shape of a heart, a leaf, or a goat head with antlers [fig. 2].9  For old rapsodë in Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro the goat head on the neck of lahutë symbolizes the helmet of Skanderbeg,10 and they call these instruments “lahutë me Skënderbeg” (lahutë with Skanderbeg). The helmet attributed to Skanderbeg—preserved in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna—was made of white metal, and it is adorned with a strip dressed in gold and at the top the head of a horned goat made of bronze and dressed in gold as well [fig. 3].11 The wild goats are understood among Albanians as fast animals, able to live in very difficult conditions, and these characteristics were also attri- buted to Skanderbeg and his followers who were able to resist for more than two decades the Ottoman empire which was at the time a strong military power. The authenticity of the helmet remains questionable. The head of the wild goat at its top seems to have been produced “in a truly excellent quality” during the fifteenth century,12 but the other parts date from the sixteenth century and have lesser quality. Furthermore, the letters on the inscription around the helmet seem to come from different times.13 Other features connected with the wild-goat head on Skanderbeg’s helm are contextualized by Matthias Pfaffenbichler, 148 </page> <page sequence="6"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) 5. The banknote of the Albanian 5000 lekë, launched into circulation by the Banka e Shqipërise on 1 January 1999.  In the Greek-influenced cultural circle of central Albania, the goat head used to play ... an important role. It was the symbol of Alexander the Great and of the King Pyrrhus of Epirus. Should the head of goat yet still be an original part of the planed crown of Georg Kastriota? Under the influence of the humanistically educated archbishop of Durrës, Paulus Angelus, and the Catholic elite surrounding Skanderbeg, in order to demonstrate the claim of equal status for the expected Albanian state with the Italian states in Albania, efforts were made to propagate Skanderbeg as the new Alexander.14 The birth name of Skanderbeg (in Albanian, Skënderbeu) was Gjergj Kastrioti, and his designation Skan- derbeg comes from the Ottoman Turkish İsekender Bey, which in translation means “Lord Alexander” or “Leader Alexander”, alluding to Alexander the Great.15 Toward the end of his analysis of Scanderbeg’s helmet Pfaffenbichler writes, considering the insignificant symbolic power of the goat head in the western and southern European cultural circles, I am inclined to see it as a true part of the planed crown of the Georg Kastriota. But this question will surely not be definitely answered.16 Regardless of the questionable authenticity, the helmet can be seen in a majority of artworks dedicated to Skanderbeg, its best-known rendition being the 1968 statue of Skanderbeg, erected in the center of the Al- banian capital, Tiranë, to mark the quincentennial of his death [fig. 4]. Only a few artworks representing Skanderbeg do not include the helmet. The best known among them is his portrait by Cristofano dell’Altissimo (ca. 1525–1605), included in the Giovio Series of portraits at the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florenze. Without his helmet, Skanderbeg is also pictured on obverse of the banknote of 5000 lekë, issued by the Albanian National Bank first time in 1999, where the portrait is based on his Florentine likeness. Next to him are shown Skanderbeg’s sword and coat-of-arms [fig. 5]. The helmet how- ever does appear centrally positioned on the reverse of the banknote. On its right is an image of Skanderbeg’s (restored) castle in his hometown Krujë, and to the left is the statue by Janaq Paço (1914–1989), also in Krujë, showing him on the horseback and wearing the helmet. 149 </page> <page sequence="7"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism 6. “Herzegovinian man singing with gusle accompani- ment”. From: Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, Narodne srpske pjesme (Leipzig, 1923), frontispiece in vol. II. As far as the lahutë is concerned, the goat head is a very frequent motive on the scroll, although there are also many instruments without it. Among the sixteen instruments kept in the collection of the Instituti i Antropologjisë Kulturore dhe Studimit të Arteve (Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Art Studies) of the Qendra e Studimeve Albanologjike (Center for Albanian Studies) in Tiranë, eight have the goat head on the scroll of the neck.17 Fifteen of the instruments in the collection were made in the twentieth century, and only one comes from the late nineteenth century. That one has on the scroll carved a warrior who has just taken his sword from the sheath.18 The available evidence is insufficiently clear about the origin of the “lahutë with Skanderbeg”, and as the matter of fact, there is still no evidence even about the beginning of the use of lahutë among Albanians. Considering that songs and lahutë belong together, one would assume that the earliest records about this performance practice could help the investigation of the instrument’s origins. But the research history of songs with lahutë has begun at the end of the nineteenth century, practically at the same time when the old- est known instruments were made. The first publication of a fragment of lyrics from the songs with lahutë, was realized in 1897 by the linguist Gustav Meyer.19 150 </page> <page sequence="8"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) 7. Albert Bates Lord, The Singer of Tales (Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1981), cover art. On the other hand, there is evidence of families in which men have played lahutë for many generations. One known example has been the family of Shaban Bash Curri from Tropojë in northern Albania, which gave in the 1980s its ninth generation of lahutarë.20 From the Rugovë region in Kosovo has been possible to recon- struct biographies of 150 lahutarë spanning the period between the late eighteenth and the middle of the twentieth century. The oldest of them was born in 1791 and the youngest in 1947.21 Additional questions rise when we contextualize the goat head on lahutë in the comparison with the gusle, same instrument used by the Albanians’ Slavic neighbors. The frontispiece of the second volume of Народне српске пјесме (Serbian folk poems) by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, published in 1823, includes an image of a Herzegovinian guslar singing to the gusle with the goat head carved on the scroll [fig. 6].22 A little more than a century later, Milman Perry and Albert Lord made between 1933 and 1935 their expeditions to Herzegovina and Montenegro looking for “singers of tales”. On the cover of the book, The Singer of Tales by Albert Lord, he included a singer playing an instrument with the goat head [fig. 7].23 This photograph can be found also reproduced on the CD ROM enclosed with the second edition of the book. The caption there reads: “Avdo Medjedovitch, peasant farmer, is the finest singer the expedition encountered. His poems reached as many as fifteen thousand lines. A veritable Yugoslav Homer!”24  Perry and Lord met several bilingual singers during the expedition, including Medjedović.25 Parry reported about one of them, In Novi Pazar I found a Moslem who had been raised in the area of Southern Serbia which is largely bilingual, who could sing the same song either in Serbian or Albanian, and accordingly I hope to obtain some definitive evidence on the passage of songs between peoples of different languages.26 151 </page> <page sequence="9"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism 8.

Tiranë, Instituti i Antropologjisë Kulturore dhe Studimit ë Arteve of the Qendra e Studimeve Albanologjike, 85/59-3.  The songs sung in the “Serbo-Croatian” transcribed by Perry and Lord are well-known through their editions starting with the Serbo-Croatian Heroic Songs (1951), which had the musical transcriptions made by Béla Bár- tok.27 This is not the case with the Albanian songs. They are still almost unknown for the scholarly inter- national community, including songs performed by bilingual singers.28 Concerning the meaning of the instru ment decorated with goat head disseminated among the Southern Slavs, Joško Ćaleta of the Institut za Etno- logiju i Folkloristiku in Zagreb, said, zoomorphic carvings, in addition to anthropomorphic ones, were common for the gusle prior to political commotions at the beginning of the 20th century. I have not found any song that describes why ram, buck or goat horns, or eagle wings stand on the top of the instrument, but I am sure that is the feature connected with the legends where those animals symbolize “something” (maybe the strength).29  At this point it should be stressed that gusle and the songs it accompanies have been politically strongly influenced during the twentieth century.30 On the ex-Yugoslav territory prior, during and after the first WW political inniciative shift the themes of the songs—all contemporary (political) repertory of gusle players become public tribunes and their appearance therefore became more visible as well as a look of their instruments that (all the way to present) shows political paraphernalia—portraits of the politicians, signs of the national orientation of the player.31 Some of the symbolic connotations of the lahutë and the songs it accompanies in Albania will be dis- cussed in the further text. Here should be mentioned that the lahutë is primarily connected with epic songs; songs about historical events or about political figures are rare. For example, in the volume with 134 folk 152 </page> <page sequence="10"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) songs dedicated to the communist leader Enver Hoxha (1908–1985), published after his death, only two are accompanied with lahutë.32 In other repertoires songs about him and the Communist Party were frequent. Politicians or singers of the political orientation have been rarely portrayed on the lahutë neck. The collec- tion of the Instituti i Antropologjisë Kulturore dhe Studimit të Arteve in Tiranë includes a lahutë with the figure of Bajram Curri (1862–1925), a rebel against the Ottoman Empire and activist for a democratic govern- ment in 1924, carved on the lower end of the neck and goat head on the scroll.33 At the scroll of another instru- ment are curved the initials PPSH, which stand for the Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë (Albanian Labor Party), the only political party in Albania until 1991 [fig. 8]. The instrument is not dated, but one can assume that it was made during the second half of the twentieth century, and before 1990, since the name of the party was changed at its tenth congress on 12 June 1991 to the Partia Socialiste e Shqipërisë (Socialist Party of Albania). Another significant aspect related to the meaning which older lahutarë give to parts of the instrument is the shape of lahutë’s bow. Although they cannot explain the basis for their opinion, they consider bow’s stick made in the shape of a serpent to be old and precious. The lahutar Rrok Prenkoçaj in Tuzi, southern Montenegro, commented in 2009 that the snake has been always considered to be a protector of the house.34 This explanation sounds convincing because the lahutë is considered to be an instrument of the house. A fa- mily without a lahutë used to be considered a shtëpi e lanun (a forgotten, neglected house/family). In contrast, families with good lahutarë used to be called shpi lahute (a lahutë house/family).35 LAHUTË IN PUBLICATIONS BEFORE WORLD WAR II. Because of its close connection with the songs, lahutë gained a high status, and singers are still today regarded in high esteem regardless that the practice is vani- shing.36 For example, forward to the second volume of Visaret e Kombit, entitled Kângë kreshnikësh dhe legenda (Epic songs and legends), begins with this comment: “The well-known Croatian writer Stanko Vraz had taken as the ‘subject’ of his literary work the expression: ‘Iz naroda za narod’—from the nation for the nation.”37 With this quote, the editors wanted to emphasize the importance of collecting and publishing lyrics of epic songs, which they “take from the nation” and “give to the nation”. The introduction begins with the phrase: “Old songs, which are known by the highlanders under the name ‘songs of the frontier warriors, ancient songs, lahutë’s songs’ are the most appreciated treasure of the language, the most vivid expression of many generous feelings and the typical embodiment of the physiognomy of our nation.38 This esteem was exemplary during the first half of the twentieth century, and therefore it is not a surprise that the songs about Muji and Halili and the instrument used to accompany them became a national symbol in public discussions, publications and works of art. In the mentioned volume of Visaret e Kombit the instru- ment is referenced in the lyrics of at least two songs. The first one is given the title “Martesa e Halilit” (The marriage of Halili).39 The lahutë is mentioned in the passage where Halili is a prisoner of the krajl, the king of the opposites, and asks for the permission to sing before his execution: 596 Pes’ dekika liri për me m’dhânë! “Give me, I beg you, five minutes of freedom, Tjetër t’mirë né t’parët nu’ na kan’ lane, Bequeathed from our fathers, we have a tradition, Kurnja nesh veç mos me dekë në t’shtrueme; To perish in bed we must not while we’re sleeping Por me shpata m’u pré tuj këndue. But rather while brandishing swords, lodly singing.” 600 Sa burrnisht kralji e ka çue! The king acceded to him nobly: Gjith‘ sa duesh, Halil, me kndue! “Take your time to sing Halili.” Edhe duert mire i a shpengojnë, From the shackless did they free him, I a kan dhanë lahutën n’dorë;40 Gave Halili his lahuta.41 In the song “Rrëmbimi i së shoqes së Mujit” (Muji’s wife is kidnapped), it is Muji who plays the lahutë in a similar situation like his brother in the previous song. 325 Edhe duerët krajli i a ká zgidhë, Gave, the hero’s hands untying, I a ká çue lahutën prej palmje, Him a maple-wood lahuta M‘a kish pasë zhargun prej magari, In a donkey hide enveloped, M‘a kish’ pasë dorcën prej thâne, Its bow was of cornelian cherry, M’i kish’ pasë qymet kali shale. Its string was from a horsetail taken. 330 Merr lahutës Muja për me i rá, Mujo took up the lahuta, N’dyzên Muja e ká vndue. Took and tuned the string to play it, 153 </page> <page sequence="11"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism Mirë ai gishtat na i shtërnon, How nimbly did his fingers scale it, Por mâ mirë me zâ i ndimon, And with a fair voice to go with it, 334 Tre sahat zâni po i shkon.42 For three hours did he sing out.43 In the tenth volume of the Visaret e Kombit, edited by Myrteza Roka and published in 1944, the lahutë is not mentioned in the songs’ lyrics.44 On the other hand, the volume is entitled Lahuta e Kosovës (The lahutë of Kosovo) and we would expect to find here lyrics of epic songs. Instead, the volume includes lyrics of lulla- bies, wedding songs, laments and in the last chapter entitled “Kangë burrnije” (Songs of manfulness) songs concerning mostly historical events.45 This repertoire is accompanied with the long neck lutes like sharkı and çifteli and not with lahutë. The title of the volume is therefore representational in its character and conveys the importance of the instrument as a symbol. Another example of the use of lahutë as a symbol can be found in the first volume with musical trans- criptions of Albanian folk songs, published in 1940 and entitled Lyra Shqiptare (The Albanian lyra).46 The preface informs us that the authors of the Visaret e Kombit made a proposal, issued on 28 November 1937, for the plans to publish a volume with Albanian folk melodies.47 The title of this volume should have been Melodi Kombëtare (National melodies), but the plan was not realized.48 Instead the task was assigned to the volume entitled in Albanian and Italian: Lyra Shqiptare: Kângë popullore të mbledhuna nen kujdesin e Radio-Tiranes/Canti popolari albanesi, raccolti a cura della Radio Tirana (The Albanian lyra: Folk songs collected on behalf of the Radio Tirana) [fig. 9a]. The term “lyra” in the title is a dialectal form of the Albanian term “lira” and related to the term for the ancient Greek lyre. This was the first time that the music transcribed in the volume was connected with ancient times. The author of the collection, Pjetër Dungu (1908–1989), was a trained musician from the town of Shkodër in northern Albania, and his position of “a supervisor of the people’s music”49  at the Radio Tirana had helped him to come in contact with music from different regions in Albania. The collection contains trans- criptions of music from urban areas which is very different from that of the highlands, where songs with lahutë are performed. Therefore any use of lahutë as a term or an image in the collection would have made no sense, and indeed the lahutë is not pictured on the cover. Within the volume, each song is accompanied by an illustration, and it is all the more surprising to find the drawing of a lahutar above the song no. 20, which comes from southern Albania, where the instrument is not used [fig. 9b]. The reason for this use of lahutë is related to the idea of the presentation of the “national culture”. Dungu describes his concern as follows: “For a long time I have tried to prepare a collection of folk songs; a difficult job for me, because the [Albanian] folk song is judged by the world as foreign stuff and not a fruit of the Albanian spirit.”50 The term “lahutë” has been used also in the literature. The best-known example might be the poem La- huta e malcís (The highland lute), written by the Roman Catholic priest Gjergj Fishta (1871–1940) in the gegë dialect. Its final edition was published in 1937, the year marking the 25th anniversary of the independence of Albania and the beginning of the publication of Visaret e Kombit. Fishta was the Head of the Comission for the Albanian alphabet during the Congress of Monastir (Kongresi i Manastirit) held in Monastir (today Bitola in Macedonia) from 14 to 22 November 1908. Until that time Albanian was written in six distinct alphabets, including Ottoman Turkish, Greek and Latin, in addition to a number of subvariants.51 In 1902 Fishta was appointed secretary of the commissariat of the Franciscan mission and the head of the Franciscan school in Shkodër. Since his first experience as pastor in the village of Gomsiqe in 1899, he had became acquainted with the life of highlanders and their tales and stories. One of them was Marash Uci from the village Rapshë in the region of Hot (presently in Montenegro) to whom Fishta dedicated the twelfth song of the poem. Over some thirty years he was working on it, his Lahuta e malcís grew into thirty songs with over 17,000 verses des- cribing a panorama of the history in northern Albania during the second half of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. The lahutë does not play any role in the poem. It is mentioned only in the title as a symbol of the highlanders’ art of telling stories: singing with lahutë. PERFORMANCES WITH LAHUTË AT THE PRESENT TIME. After World War II, the lahutë and the songs it accompanies continue to be a symbol of high status, and the lahutarë still identify themselves with the world of songs. Isë Elezi from the Rugovë region in Kosovo mentioned in May 2010 that “everyone can play lahutë, just as everyone can also sing songs, but the good lahutar is judged how he begins and finishes, how he 154 </page> <page sequence="12"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) connects the sections of the song, how well he stitches them together”.52  Hysen Matoshi, the director of the Instituti Albanologjik i Prishtinës (Albanological Institute of Prishtinë), acknowledged that in the Gallap region in Kosovo, the practice of epic songs has been lost, but people still tell a story about a lahutar who was tending his cows and got so involved with singing a song for himself that he has not even noticed that the cows were eating the corn nearby which his family needed to survive during the year. People came and told him that he should stop the song and pay attention what the cows were doing, and he answered: “I can not let Muji stay in prison!”53 The Factor of Time for the Performance. Songs about Muji and Halili together with the instrument which accompanies them have almost disappeared from the daily life. They are not broadcasted anymore in radio and television programs and they are also rare on the recordings’ market. On the other hand, they can be listened to from a considerable number of websites, in concerts of local music, at folklore festivals and in public meetings of rhapsods. In these cases though, instead of songs performed in their integral forms, they are presented mostly in fragments. Performances which may normally last up to one and a half hours are shortened to only a few minutes, appearing only as advertising spots. Such a practice is not appreciated by lahutars and they rebel against it. A few years ago, when the lahutar Sadik Abazaj from Rugovë in Kosovo has been invited to perform in the town Bajram Curri (northern Albania), he had been told to finish on the sign by the event producer. As he intended to sing the song to the end, he ignored all signs, even when an organizer climbed on the stage, insisting that he should come to an end with his performance.54 The practice of the public presentations has an impact on the performance in everyday life. For example, following his 37-minute long performance of a song, the 75-year-old lahutar Rustem Bajram Nikshi, com- mented: “Too long!” (E zgjatme shum!), indicating that he could have sung longer, but he was hesitant to bother the guest. Later on he said, “today nobody wants to listen to long songs”,55 referring to other public presentations where he has been regularly invited to perform. In another case, the 65-years-old lahutar Asllan Ramë Kastrati asked before he was ready to sing whether he should sing the song without interrupting it,56 since he had also experienced public presentations in which he had been asked to sing only short fragments. In this case his performance lasted for 45 minutes. Afterwards he said that he had not performed the song since many years, but he could remember it because it was one of his favourites. Asked about the tempo, he answered: “Well, I sung it a bit faster. Otherwise I would have run out of breath. It is not easy to sing long songs and you need practice to remain in a good form.”57 The Sitting of Lahutar on Stage. Among the changes influenced by performances of songs on stage is the alteration of lahutar’s sitting position. At home lahutarë usually perform cross-legged, sitting on a seat cushion, holding the instrument in a perpendicular position or a bit leaning to the side. Such position is comfortable for a performer to play for a long time. On the stage the lahutarë are asked as a rule to play sitting on a chair, what makes it difficult to find a position in which the instrument can lean naturally and the body of the performer can be relaxed during a long performance. This is, however, less important since lahutarë are usually asked to perform on the stage only for a few minutes. Another reason for performing cross-ledged is related to the meaning which lahutarë assign to the instrument in the performance’s ritual. Isë Elezi said: “The lahutë asks for a bit of ... the atmosphere, that is the rule ... I myself cannot play on lahutë sitting on a chair ... I have no feelings for playing on lahutë when I am sitting on a chair. I have never, never seen an Albanian playing lahutë in an odë sitting on a chair!”58 And it was him who did not agree to perform sitting on a chair during the performance at the University of Vienna in 2005, following the lecture by the researcher Zymer Neziri concerning the songs about Muji and Halili. Since the audience wanted to have a clear view of the performer the organizers arranged for him to perform sitting cross-ledged on a table.59 Lahutarë in Folklore Festivals and Public Gatherings. Another question about practice arises when juries at folklore festivals give awards by listening only to short performances. This is how it happens that singers and players receive awards although they are not considered to be good performers in their communities, where they are criticized for knowing only fragments of songs and do not show the rapsodë qualities mentioned before. Nonetheless, awards they receive make them among general audience personification of lahutar. 155 </page> <page sequence="13"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism 9a. Pjetër Dungu, Lyra Shqiptare/Canti popolari albanesi (Novara: Istituto Geografico De Agostini, 1940), title page. It is known that the rhapsodists might have higher esteem for each other than the recognition they receive from the general audience. It is also known that they do not perform in front of a performer they consider to be better.60 LAHUTË AND WOMEN. Songs about Muji and Halili belong distinctively to the male song-type and their practice is exclusive. On the other hand, women do on occasions perform these songs regardless that as a rule they are not allowed to. Among those who play lahutë are the so-called “sworn virgins” or “women who become men”.61 The term “sworn virgin” is an often used translation from the Albanian terms “burrneshë” and/or “virgjineshë”. The term “burrneshë” comes from “burrë”, which means “man”, and designates a “brave woman” who behaves like a courageous man. This adjective is used also for women who have ful- filled important deeds, like fighting for the indipendence of the country or for the rights of communities left outside the political borders of the Albanian state, or who fell working for the country during the commu- nism. The term “virgjineshë”, which is used mostly in the everyday life, comes from “virgin” and signifies the woman who decided to be a man by staying virgin for whole her life. As Antonia Young and Larenda Twigg state, 156 </page> <page sequence="14"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) 9b. Pjetër Dungu, Lyra Shqiptare/Canti popolari albanesi, song no. 20, “Manushaqkez e mavi” (Blue black violet) with the illustration of a lahutar. In traditional patriarchal society in the southern Balkans, there has long been an option to provide male heirs where none exist: a girl or woman may herself, or her parents—even at her birth—declare that she has become male. In these cases the female thenceforth dresses as a boy/man, performs male tasks and mixes socially as a male. With the change she swears virginity and may never revert to her birth gender. This choice assures inheritance of a family home or may allow a girl honorably to refuse to marry the man chosen as her future husband.62 Among the male activities in this area have been included the performance of songs with lahutë and so have done and still do some “virgjinesha”. A picture of such a player in men traditional clothing has been published by René Grémaux in 1994.63  As far as the epic songs are concerned, there have been also women who did not performe publicaly, but knew “hundreds and thousands of verses from the songs”.64 One known case is that of Sabile Fetahu (Rako- vica) from the village Ajval near Prishtinë in Kosovo, who used to live in Vanaj near Fier in southern Albania. She had no formal education, but in 1967 she was still able to remember over eight thousand verses of the Kreshnikë songs.65 157 </page> <page sequence="15"> Ardian Ahmedaja, The Lahutë between Everyday Practice and Symbolism Women’s interest in the practice of these songs may be also exemplified by a story told by Sadik Abazaj, a rapsod from Rugovë, in Kosovo. It is about his father, who used to be a well-known siger of epic songs. One time in the 1950s, he was not able to return home from the town during the day and stayed for one night as a guest at people he knew in a village along the way. This used to be quite a normal practice at the time since it provided a good occasion to socialize with friends and to make music with them. While performing in the “men’s room” (oda e burrave), women of the house where listening outside leaning against the door. At one moment the door could not sustain the pressure and women fell into the room. The lahutar continued the performance while the head of the family invited the women to stay and listen. In discussions of the performance skills of lahutars women used to play an important role at home. Therefore drawing their attention was a sign of a high capability. In this respect the exclusivity in the perfor- mance practice of epic song can be questioned at least concerning the role that certain segments of the community play in the process of perception and discussing about music making, constructing ideas, con- texts of performance, or contents of repertoires. Important is also to remember that part of this process make fairy tales based on the songs which women tell to their children and grandchildren. INCLUSIVITY, EXCLUSIVITY, ELITISM. The phenomena of inclusivity, exclusivity and elitism are of interest in the framework of the lahutarë, because these antagonisms do interfere with each other. In the context of local communities, lahutarë are still highly respected. Even their short public presentations help their inclusion in the public musical life, but on the other hand they are susceptible to its rules, very different to the domestic tradition. Other important factor in this context is the fast change of the musical life which is occurring in local communities. The mentioned rhapsods from Rugovë in Kosovo, live in urban areas for the last two decades. They return to their native villages and alpine pastures where they were grewing up with epic songs only during the summer months. Thus they cannot help being confronted with new musical tendencies, even up to DJ-ing which are referred to in public discussions by the derogatory word “tallava” (a meaningless term). Their disagreement with this “new music” goes so far that they refuse to attend even weddings of their relatives, thus seriously damaging their relationship with them. Bajram Nikshi, over 70 years of age, com- mented how difficult is for his generation to agree with the way weddings are being organized now. He has been invited for more than thirty years to make music at weddings and has been paid for it. He has played several instruments, has sung and has been a well-known dancer. But, nowadays, he cannot stand weddings because of the loud performances of the “tallava songs” (kong’ tallava) and because there are no rules, as they used to be in the past. At weddings in the past, he said, it was important to talk to each other and to make music as a sign of respect. He himself has been very rigorous. If they have listened to the song carefully ... I was interested to fulfil their wish and sing the song until the end ... When the men in the room begun to be uninterested, they started talking to each other. I have been so strict, that when I saw two men talking to each other I used to interrupt the song. I saw that it has no effect ... So, I could drink a coffee, or a tea, or a glass of brandy... But the others asked me again for the song. “Come on, sing the song further.” At the moment I told them: “Yes, if you know where I stopped and what was the last word, I will continue to sing this song.” And not one time, but many times. They had the attitude, when they saw me singing, they took care of the last word, always! ... When they found it, I sung the song to the end. When they did not (they used to say): “No, no, you know where you stopped.” “Well, I know where I stopped, but you were not attentive to listen to, which means you had no interest, and you do not know. For that reason you do not know it, so why should I sing for?”66 The exclusivity of epic songs and the tradition of lahutarë in the everyday life make them a kind of “the last tradition carriers”. Attempts to include in their circle younger rapsods have not been successful because of the social and economical changes in the society and the obviously weak interest of authorities promoting cultural policies. The initiatives of lahutarë to introduce young musicians or pupils to the instrument, the songs and the production of instruments have not been supported. The few young rhapsods do not have much to do with the “mainstream” musical life. Nevertheless, they are respected by their contemporaries for maintaining a significant segment of the cultural heritage. It is irrelevant whether they perform only parts of songs, since this is what the current practice mostly offers. They come usually from lahutars’ families and 158 </page> <page sequence="16"> Music in Art XXXVIII/1–2 (2013) want to continue with the practice they inherited from their grandfathers, but are nevertheless not too optimistic about their future. They understand the new situation in the country as a time that is excluding epic songs from the everyday life very quickly and forever. NOTES 1  Albert B. Lord, The Singer of Tales.
