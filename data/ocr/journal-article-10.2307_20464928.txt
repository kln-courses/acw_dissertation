<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON METAPHOR AND ANALOGY IN THE CONCEPTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH1 By Margaret Kartomi Abstract Artists, scholars and audiences in Aceh, the northernmost province of Sumatra, conceive of their percussive, wind and string instruments as symbolising Aceh's "glorious past" and attach a variety of metaphorical and analogous meanings to them. Implicit in the culture, and formulated explicitly by Acehnese scholars, is a classification that divides the instruments at the most general level into three main categories, or metaphorical socio-historical streams: those associated primarily with (i) the pre-Islamic ancestral and nature venerating (animist-Hindu) stream, practices, or presumed origins (ii) the Sunni and/or Syiah Islamic stream (including borderline cases of instruments that straddle both Islamic and animist practices), and (iii) the European or Western socio-historical stream. Organological sub-categories at the second level of categorical thinking are based on an instrument's manner of exciting sound, while the third level comprises the instrumental types with their local names. The instruments are also attributed with broader, changing socio-cultural meanings, including gender and class divisions. Introduction How can musical instruments and the genres in which they are played denote things metaphorically, or by analogy? To consider this question, we need to examine concepts held about instruments as well as their organology and indigenous classification systems in actual societies. The expression concept of instruments refers to the dominant or competing views in a society of the meaning and significance of instruments as symbolic and cultural phenomena (Kartomi 1990: xv). Metaphor may be defined as "a figure of speech in which a word or phrase denoting one kind of object or action is used in place of another to suggest 1 Original data for this article were obtained from my fieldtrips in Aceh and among Acehnese in Jakarta in 1982 (February-March and August), 2003 (February-March) and among Acehnese in Jakarta, (January-February, 2004). On my field trips to Aceh in 1982 and 2003, I was very grateful to the many Acehnese artists for their performances and discussions about the nature and meaning of their performing arts culture, as well as to Acehnese diaspora musicians who assisted me in Jakarta in 2003 and 2004. I am especially grateful to the master artists and dear colleagues Bp Noerdin Daood and Bp Marzuki Hassan, to Mark Durie for valuable linguistic advice, to Kay Dreyfus and Iwan Dzulvan Amir for their thoughtful critical readings of this article, to Gary Swinton and Iwan Dzulvan Amir for art work and to Mas Kartomi for taking photographs in the field and helping in countless ways.

Most metaphors depend on perceptions of analogy, which can be either broad and diffuse, "embracing relationships that actually exist among things of this world as well as resemblances, close and remote, that have been created, imposed, conceived or suggested by human beings" (Pont 1991:193). Analogy plays an important role in human thinking, though its real cultural significance is not generally realised. Thinking in analogies can lend great explanatory power to an idea; it can also suggest new concepts altogether.3 A metaphor may be expressed in various ways in poetic or prose forms, as in Aceh's heritage of literary and improvised song and legends. A metaphor may also be tersely and concisely expressed in the form of an analogy, which may be defined as "a process of reasoning by parallel cases,"9 or, more precisely, as a ratio or series of ratios, as in a statement of the form "a is to b as c is to d" (a:b :. c.d) (Websters, ibid.). Like metaphors, statements of analogy (from the Greek ana logon, "according to ratio") denote likenesses across domains, but generally do so in a more precise, proportional way, though both metaphorical and analogical forms can express the same symbolic meanings. In my attempt to answer the question of how instruments denote things metaphorically, I shall explain relevant concepts in the form of analogies, focusing on the instruments of the ethnic Acehnese (Ureueng Aceh),4 the most numerous of the several ethnic groups who inhabit large parts of the coastal and interior areas of Aceh (see map 1),5 the northernmost province of the island of Sumatra Indonesia. 2 This definition is from Websters 3rd Unabridged International Dictionary. 3 For example, Malthus's theory of populations suggested to Charles Darwin the concept of evolution by natural selection. 4 All terms are given here in Acehnese (terms and spelling are based mainly on Aboe Bakar et al 2001) unless otherwise stated (Ind.=Bahasa Indonesia, Malay=Bahasa Melayu [Malay], Ar.=Arabic). 5 The Acehnese ethno-linguistic group inhabit parts of the kabupaten (districts) of Aceh Besar, Pidie, Bireuen, Aceh Utara, Aceh Jaya, Aceh Barat and Nagan Raya. The other main groups are the Gayo in the kabupaten of Aceh Tengah and Aceh Gayo-Lues, the Alaih or Alas people in the kabupaten of Aceh Tenggara, the Teumieng (Malay: Tamiang) in the coastal areas of the kabupaten of Aceh Timur, the Singke or Singkil people of the kabupaten of Aceh-Singkil, the Kluet people of kabupaten Singkil, the Pulo (Island) people of Simeulue island, and the Aneuk Jam?e in the kabupaten of Aceh Barat, Nagan Raya, Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Selatan and Aceh Singkil. The other groups differ somewhat in their language and culture from the ethnic Acehnese. However, they share an almost universal adherence to Islam, while preserving some of the tenets and artistic expressions of what they term their "pre-Islamic" beliefs and have also adopted instruments and styles of Western or popular culture in recent decades. They also share some musical instruments and genres, and in some cases, body percussion. Non-Acehnese ethnic groups will not be discussed here.</page><page sequence="3">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 27 Mp .

Thus, body percussion is regarded as quite separate from instrumental music, even though it often sounds instrumental - indeed, it somewhat resembles rapa'i (frame drum) playing, especially when the body percussionists build up amazingly fast, intricate interlocking textures that reach the ultimate in virtuoso musical performance. Only man-made, "inanimate" instruments of material culture are seen as "musical instruments" (alat meuse'b) (pers. comm. from Marzuki Hassan, 2004). Acehnese artists and audiences primarily associate animate body percussive sounds with dance, since dancers routinely perform over twenty types of body percussion sounds with particular movements and only secondarily as musical sound. The types of body percussion could, therefore, be included in a classification of percussive body movements made in the dances and devotional exercises. However, as the scope of this article does not include the very large, un-researched topic of Acehnese body movements, body percussion types will necessarily be the subject of a separate study. Apart from a short chapter in the two-volume book: The Achehnese (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 1:257-265) and a few references by other Dutch colonial period writers (for example, Kreemer 1922-23:x), the only studies of Aceh's instruments to date are by three groups of Acehnese scholars who wrote booklets issued by Indonesia's Department of Education and Culture (edited by Burhan et al (1986-87), Isjkarim et al (1980-81) and Idris et al (1993)), and an article by the present author (2004) on types and functions of the frame drum (rapa'i), one of Aceh's main families of instruments. The present article will begin by delineating Acehnese artists', scholars' and teachers' dominant concept of musical instruments, including a range of instrumental types that musicians play in purely musical items or to accompany dances, devotional exercises, processions, and ceremonies. It will then show how the main classification presented here emerges from those concepts of instruments held within the culture and briefly describe each of the main musical instruments,7 including their organological structures and changing symbolic associations over the past century. This classification reflects the conceptual basis and identity of the society that produced it; and its attributes are conceptualized in people's thinking about other objects and ideas as well (Kartomi 1990:12-13). Indeed, a gulf exists between such culture emerging classifications as this and observer-imposed schemes, an example of which is the universal division of instruments into idiophones (self-sounders), membranophones (instruments with vibrating membranes), aerophones (instruments containing one extended episodes of body percussion, employing over twenty different kinds of percussive body sounds, the resulting body percussion music being arguably the most highly developed of any in the world. In some contemporary performances (kreasi baru), artists may combine vocal and instrumental music with body percussion, but they were traditionally kept as separate categories. 7 With the exception of the seurun? kal?e (shawm) and geundrang (drum), space prevents systematic discussion here of the ergology of the instruments. For the ergology of rapa 'i making, see Kartomi 2004:56-59. Nor is there sufficient space here to discuss the acoustic qualities and musical style of the instruments when played.</page><page sequence="5">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 29 or more columns of air) and chordophones (instruments with strings) developed by Hombostel and Sachs (1914 [1961]) and intended for application in museums and comparative, cross-cultural scholarly purposes. Such schemes can of course be applied to an instrumentarium such as Aceh's, but their characters of division are not representative of the culture. Indeed in Aceh's case they result in lopsided groupings, as the great majority of the instruments belong to the second category, only a few to the first category, and very few to the other two. Culture-emerging concepts of instrument and classification in Aceh The [pre-Islamic] associated stream of thought Acehnese artists and writers primarily differentiate between their instruments on the basis of their perceived origins in or associations with aliran (B.I., "streams") of socio-historical thought. 8 So, for example, Isjkarim and his team of co-authors write about "an aliran of spirit veneration"9 (Isjkarim et al 1980-81: 94) that was linked to the "Hindu culture brought to Aceh by Indian traders and migrants"10 (ibid.: 4), as distinct from the time that the Acehnese people were "convinced they should accept the teachings of Islam"'" (ibid.), beginning in the thirteenth century and becoming widespread from the sixteenth. They identify some instruments and genres of music and dance as originating from the pre-Islamic stream: the two-headed drum geundrang, for example, is "thought to have existed from the times of the pre-Islamic kingdoms of Aceh and to have originated in Hindu culture"'2 (ibid.: 57). Isjkarim et al wrote that Muslim-approved genres with religious texts, such as rateb meuseukat, on the other hand, originated in the Middle East (ibid.: 19 1), while the East Acehnese-Malay japen dance and its accompanying instruments (biola and drums), associated with Islam, were probably transplanted to Aceh by Arab or Turkish traders (ibid.: 88). The authors in this team express a preference for the Muslim-linked 8 The metaphorical Indonesian term aliran ("stream") used by the teams of Acehnese scholars appropriately implies that the socio-historical streams of instruments and genres are fluid; they overlap. In the following discussion, the term aliran will be used interchangeably with another metaphorical term - "strata," which conjures up a mental picture of self-contained sedimentary layers in a cross-section of rock; i.e., "strata" metaphorically depicts the socio-historical layers of instruments, artistic thought and practice that still co-exist in Aceh. Thus, for example the Islamic aliran still includes instruments associated with the pre-Islamic aliran, such as the geundrang (drum), which is used in the contexts of both streams. 9 The original Indonesian words translated here are "aliran kepercayaan dan pengaruh jiwd\ Acehnese terms for nature spirit and ancestral veneration are hyang diseuma (spirit veneration) and nek muyang diseumah (veneration of the ancestors) (Aboe Bakar et al 2001:631). 10 The original Indonesian words translated here are "kebudayaan Hindu yang dibawa oleh para pedagang dan pengembara dari India". 11 The original Indonesian words translated here are "keyakinan ajaran Islam dikalangan rakyaf. 12 The original Indonesian words translated here are "diperkirakan permainan [geundrang] ini telah ada sejak zaman Kerajaan-Aceh dan berasal dari Kebudayaan Hindu".</page><page sequence="6">30 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC artistic genres. They assert that the pre-Islamic genres are sumbang ("wrong, off track") (ibid.:94) and dismiss as mistik (mystical) such genres as the ulak ("water flowing backwards") dance that they describe as being performed after a shaman makes offerings to the spirits (ibid.: 104). They do not, however, reject those non Islamic genres to which Muslim phrases or songs of praise have been added. They express approval, for example, of the ula-ula lembing ("weaving snake") dance despite its clear pre-Islamic origins, noting that efficacious phrases such as puji pade Tuhan ilahi Rabbi... Assalamualaikum ("peace be with you") have been added (ibid.:94-6). Even instruments believed to have pre-Islamic era origins in Aceh, such as the geundrang, can become acceptable if performed with the singing of Muslim phrases accompanied by the rapa'i. Although the overt function of the drum music is to entertain and socialize an occasion with its musical sounds and to accompany shamanic dancing, its metaphorical meaning is much greater: rhythms played in a ritual context are believed to provide the motive force by which the shaman enters into a state of trance and journeys in the spirit world to obtain healing or clairvoyance on behalf of his community. The key to the drums' aesthetic power is a system of esoteric analogies which charge the drum and its mystically named rhythms (for example, lagee bakdo salam, "greetings [to the spirits) rhythm/music"), which have cosmological and social meaning. Such meanings are also transferred across to a Muslim context if the drums are played in a ritual of believed pre-Islamic origin or with the addition of Muslim prayers. For example, in tiger-capturing rituals, the shamans recite prayers in Arabic before and after singing the mystical texts and playing the drums. Because of the association of this practice with black magic, shamans claim they only sing songs associated with white magic (ilmu batin). Other instruments are similarly linked metaphorically with the invisible world. The geundrang is therefore conceived of as belonging both to the pre-Islamic and the Islamic aliran, a reminder of the fact that classificatory borders normally include ambiguous or exceptional specimens that straddle two categories.13 The three groups of Acehnese authors collapse the animist and Hindu Buddhist strata into one, so-called "pre-Islamic" (yoh gohlom Islam) associated stream, contrasting it with the "Islamic era" (masa Islam) associated stream. This two-aliran model has been followed in the preparation of chart 1, "Classification of Musical Instruments". For the sake of completeness, however, I have added a third aliran, which lies beyond the scope of the Acehnese authors' writings. The third stream, entitled meukaphe (literally meaning kafir, "unbelievers"), comprises instruments of Western origin that were adopted in Aceh in the past few centuries of European contact. It comprises (i) instruments of European origin, such as the biola (originally perhaps a violin, or probably a viola) that was introduced into parts of the archipelago from the sixteenth century by members of the Portuguese colonial power, and (ii) instruments of the "Western popular" stratum that emerged over the past half-century with the development of global styles of popular or commercial music in Aceh. Vestiges of all three strata and their associated instruments can still be observed to coexist in Aceh (and many 13 The question as to whether the piano is a percussive or a string instrument is an oft-cited example of an organological borderline case in a taxonomy of instruments.</page><page sequence="7">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 31 other societies in Indonesia). Over the centuries, the Acehnese tolerated and combined facets of all the relevant religions in various syncretic combinations, expressions of which are apparent to this day.

Classification of musical instruments according to Acehnese characters of division. Developed by Margaret Kartomi, Drawing: Iwan Dzulvan Amir based on early models by Gary Swinton, Department of Environmental Studies, Monash University. These three strata form the first character of division in the classification</page><page sequence="8">32 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC of Acehnese musical instruments presented in Chart 1 and discussed below. The second character of division (using Acehnese terms) is the mode of sound excitation: peh ("to beat"), yub ("to blow"), pet ("to pluck"), geusok or gise'ng ("to bow") an instrument, and in the last sub-category, pet ("to pluck") or peh ("to beat or play") an electronic instrument (alat meuseb listrik).14 The three-category classification is implicit in the Acehnese authors' discourse about instruments. At the third and lowest level of division, the first (beaten) category of pre-Islamic instruments includes the double-headed drum (geundrang), (single-headed) hourglass drum (geudumba), the xylophone (canang, canang ceureukeh) and the rice-stamping trough and beater (ale tunjang). The second (blown) category comprises the duct flute (bansi, bangsi), end-blown flute (suleng), rice-stalk clarinet (seurune), wooden clarinet (seurune' kalee), buffalo horn (beureugu) and reed pipe (buloh meurindu).The third (pulled) category comprises the jews harp (genggong);15 and the fourth (bowed) category contains the bowed, three-string, spike instrument (hareubab), now virtually obsolete, and the biola Aceh ("Acehnese violin"). The latter is thought by some to be based, like the biola (violin), on the viola (or violin) that was probably introduced into Aceh and other Malay-speaking areas of the archipelago over ensuing centuries by the Portuguese after their defeat of Malacca in 1511. However, the shape of the biola Aceh is far removed from that of its European counterpart, unlike that of the biola, which is still played in most Malay-speaking areas of the archipelago and forms part of the Western category of instruments in Aceh. As it is also played in a thoroughly Acehnese way, without a hint of Western tunings or harmony, the biola Aceh is thus classified within the pre Islamic associated category. The Islamic-associated stream of thought Almost all of Aceh's approximately four million people today are Muslims. Known for centuries as "The Verandah of Mecca" (B.I., Serambi Mekkah), Aceh has long been regarded as a devout religious centre. There is considerable evidence that, over the centuries, Acehnese pilgrims and traders brought back religious controversies from Egypt, Arabia, Turkey, Persia and India about the use or non-use of music and musical instruments in the various styles of worship; several historians have observed that streams of Islamic thought came to Aceh either directly from Arabia or Egypt or by way of the Mogul and other kingdoms of India.16 Some rural people identify with a mystical Sufi-oriented form of Islam, though there were also two periods of Syiah influence: the first, of which vestiges remain to this day, dates from the fourteenth century, when the relatively 14 The electric/electronic sub-category, however, is technically an exception to the operative character of division as it designates amplifying, rather than exciting, the sound. 15 The Jew's harp is called pop? in Gayo (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 II: 258). 16 Benda (1958:12) noted that Islam in Indonesia was "filtered through the religious experience of India. It "thus acquired mystical elements that fitted it to operate within the Indonesian setting" (Legge 1964:49), as well, it might be added, as building on pre existing mystical ideas of ancestral and nature spirit veneration.</page><page sequence="9">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 33 simple Syiah rituals became widespread; the second dates from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when British Sepoy soldiers settled around Sumatra's coast, including Aceh's. The latter is the period in which the more elaborate North Indian Syiah ritual called tabutl7 began to be widely performed in coastal towns of Sumatra (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 1:202-207), with the geundrang klng (Indian drum) remaining as a testimony to this performing stream to this day in Sigli (the Pidie area).18 Wahhabism was also a strong influence in the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries. Dominant in the past century, however, are the Sunni forms of worship. In the latter half of the second millennium, strong Sufi influences among both Sunni and Syiah believers resulted in the establishment of brotherhoods (tarikat, Ar. tariqah) throughout Aceh, formed from the sixteenth century or earlier and exemplified by the rapa'i geurimpeng, rapai pulot and rapa'i daboh frame drum genres mentioned below.19 The men of a village would join groups with names such as tarikat Nakeusabandi, tarikat Sadali, tarikat Samaniah, and tarikat Satari to study Sammaniyyah,20 Syattarriyyah, Syadziliyyah and Nawsyibandiyah teachings (Aboe Bakar et al 2001: 944, 838). For generations, members studied their particular tarikat customs (cok/tueng tarikat, Aboe Bakar et al 2001: 944), played their frame drums (rapa'i) and sang religious songs of praise in each other's homes on Thursday or Friday evenings, on holy days, and at weddings and other celebrations. The enthusiastic local acceptance of the brotherhoods and the exciting forms of religious exercises associated with them certainly promoted an emotional attachment to Islam in Acehnese communities. As Islam became the dominant religion, Aceh's indigenous wind, string and percussion instruments continued to be played only in animist-Hindu or secular contexts belonging to the non-Islamic strata of culture. Historical sources show, moreover, that in the colonial period (1873-c.1940), controversy about religion, the arts, gender and temporal power raged between the religious leaders (ulama) and members of the land-owning, aristocratic administrative class (ulebalang) who ruled in the countryside with the support of the Dutch colonial power.21 The ukebalang (and Dutch colonial administrators) continued to promote the non-Islamic arts, such as female welcome dances accompanied by the clarinet and drum ensemble, partly 17 For a description of the Hasan and Husen-celebrating tabut pageant with dol and tasa drums of Persian or North Indian Syiah origin in Pariaman, West Sumatra, and references to it in coastal Acehnese towns, see Kartomi, 1986. 18 I interviewed some Syiah believers and obtained some tabut-lmked instruments from them in Sigli in 1982. It is unlikely, however, that tabut culture is still practiced there, although the geundrang kl?ng are still played in ensembles in Great Aceh and Aceh-Pidie. 19 Detailed discussion of the ergology, uses and genres of these various rapa'i instruments is to be found in Kartomi 2004. 20 The founder of the tarikat Sammaniyyah in Aceh in the first half of the eighteenth century, travelling Arabic Sy?h Muhammad Saman, is credited with having originated the Gayo and Acehnese practice of rat?b saman, with its emphasis on thunderous and lithe body movements/percussion. 21 See Reid 2005: 14, 92, 143, 232-4 for references up to the 19th century and 286-89 and 327-28 for the twentieth century.</page><page sequence="10">34 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC as a means of asserting their power against the rival ulama, who promoted genres in which Islamic texts were sung accompanied by or in altemation with frame drum ensemble or body percussion. Rivalry between the two groups of leaders emphasized the distinctions between the pre-Islamic and Islamic strata. The influence of the ulama waxed and waned; but it was so strong in the early 1950s that seudati performances were banned for a while for being "immoral" (Lance Castles, pers. comm., 2004). In post-colonial Aceh, the aristocratic attachment to the "animist-Hindu" and secular dances and music was taken over by Indonesian government officials, which has enabled both Islamic and non-Islamic performing arts, as well as kreasi baru ("new creations") based on the traditional genres and Acehnese styles of globalised-popular music and dance, to be performed in the competitive festivals it runs and at official government functions. Wahhabi and other orthodox ulama and their followers, in both Aceh and the holy land, have argued that musical instruments associated with pre Islamic belief, should be avoided, claiming that they can distract people from prayer and work and lead them into illicit activity, especially involving sex and alcohol (Baily, 1988: 146-147). Unlike other specimens of Aceh's existing instrumentarium, however, they saw frame drums as belonging to the Islamic stream, even though some may well have existed in Aceh in pre-Islamic times.22 Normally played in male-only ratoh performances that included some religious song texts, frame drums are believed to have been the instrument favoured by the prophet Muhammad. Referring to one of the hadith,23 an ulama told me that the prophet Muhammad approved of frame drums in rituals of rejoicing; and that the medium-large, medium and small frame drums in Aceh were acceptable for use in male ratoh performances (M.Husin Amin, pers. comm., 1982). However, even some frame drums, especially the great rapa'i Pase, have mixed pre-Islamic and Islamic associations melded together in people's minds as syncretic. Many orthodox Acehnese ulamas showed a preference for divinely created, "animate" instruments, by which they meant the human voice and body percussion, to man-made "inanimate" instruments (as medieval Arab and European writers called them).24 Their view may have resulted from their contact 22 As Doubleday (1999:105) notes, frame drums were played in Mesopotamia in 4,000 3,000 BCE. 23 Choudhury (1957:70).also mentions hadiths (narrative records of the sayings of Muhammad and his companions) to show that the prophet regarded frame drums as lawful in rituals of rejoicing such as weddings. 24 Acehnese writers and thinkers do not use the terms "animate" and "inanimate" instruments as did Plato, Aristotle and other Hellenic and Hellenistic Greek writers as well as medieval Arabic and European writers on music who regarded the "animate" human voice as the most complete of all "instruments", and certainly superior to "inanimate" instruments (for example, see Aristotle Poetics 1.4-5, al-F?r?bi, Introduction, Grand Book (d'Erlanger 1930 1:21-22), and Clement of Alexandria, Exhortation to the Greeks). However, given the preferred use of the human voice and body movement in most of Aceh's genres of praise (Sufi rat?b) and the view held by many ulama (religious leaders) and followers that "inanimate" instruments of material culture (apart from the frame drum)</page><page sequence="11">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 35 with the teachings over the centuries of anti-Sufi Muslim leaders such as Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1238), who denounced the playing of musical instruments, clapping and other bodily noises as acts of idolatry leading to satanic possession (Shiloah 1979:221). If so, however, such extremist views must have been contested by early and late Acehnese Muslim-Sufi saints who defended the use of the rapa'i in the popular samak ("remembrance of God") devotions, and some ulama continued to defend them in the 1950s-60s, 1980s and even the early 2000s. Although the mystically inclined Sufi leaders clashed at times with the orthodox Wahhabi ulama, who disapproved of mystical genres, both Sunni and Syiah leaders forbad the use of inanimate instruments in Acehnese mosques, 25 but even those who argued against the use of instruments have in general tolerated frame drums and body percussion in some religious contexts outside the mosques. Religious leaders have not overly concerned themselves with the use of instruments in secular art forms though they forbad the mixing of the sexes on stage as well as any art form associated with immorality.26 Although Acehnese performing groups and audiences are normally gender-segregated, men and women apparently hold to the same basic concept of instruments. Some instruments are played more by one gender than the other. Women play flutes in the rice-fields and some less portable instruments, such as the xylophones, at home, while men play the portable clarinets and large, less portable frame drums in public performances. Within the dominant male concept of instruments, however, one may find variant views and preferences for certain instruments. One view is held by the abovementioned ukebalang and their post colonial, government official successors, who by all accounts promoted the performing arts associated with the pre-Islamic or animist/Hindu stratum, including female dances accompanied by such instruments as the seurune kalee, geundrang, sulng and bansi or bangsi. Some of those ulama who approved of frame drums if used in a religious context, disapproved of the very large frame drum (rapa'i Pase) because of its pre-Islamic origins, despite the fact that its name commemorates that of the first Muslim kingdom, Pase (B.M., Pasai). Other ulama who promoted Sufi brotherhoods and moderate Sunni belief approved the use of medium frame drums in the daboh ritual, which aims to show its participants' devotion to Allah, despite its inclusion of pre-Islamic practices. are suitable only for secular entertainment, it is apparent that a conceptual division between "animate" and "inanimate" sound-producing agents exists in the culture. 25 Leaders of the Shafi'i school and some other anti-Sufi religious leaders throughout the Islamic world over the past millennium disapproved of the use of instruments in worship in the mosques and even in religious contexts outside them. Thus, the Egyptian born writer al-Haythami [d. Mecca 1567] attacked musical instruments in all contexts, including the frame drum, duff [Shiloah 1979: 129]. However, Sufi ideas seem to have prevailed in Aceh. 26 Some Acehnese hikayat (long written or oral stories) attack immoral practices such as pederasty, partaking of opium, gambling, theft, cockfight organising, and plundering (Hikajat Ranto,Drewes 1980:11)</page><page sequence="12">36 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Individual musical instruments grouped according to socio-historical streams of thought Each of the individual instruments appearing in the classification table (Chart 1) will now be described and their associations with the three streams or strata-the pre-Islamic, Islamic and Western associated-explained. The teams of Acehnese scholars referred to above differentiate between two components of the pre Islamic stratum: animist and Hindu, but usually group them together under the one heading of "pre-Islamic". The pre-Islamic associated stream: animist- and Hindu-associated components Persisting at the base of the religious and social beliefs of most Southeast Asian peoples, even where they have adopted Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam or Christianity, is the tradition of veneration of the ancestors or deities such as animal-spirits and the rice goddess, an animist system of belief with roots in the millennia before the Common Era. Objects of the material culture believed to have ancient origins, such as some musical instruments, are regarded as gifts of the ancestors, and as such possess a religious aura. Through the spirits that inhabit them, the instruments are believed to serve as a means of contacting the supernatural for the common good, such as ensuring fertility, or healing. Besides producing beautiful sounds and admired as works of visual art, each is associated with a precise socio-historical context of religious ritual and belief. In the prayers and song texts accompanied by animist-associated instruments, Hindu gods or goddesses may be addressed, for example, in ale tunjang (rice-stamping) music, with performers stamping the husks off the rice-grain after each harvest in rituals formerly dedicated to the rice goddess. In some ritual vocal and instrumental genres of believed pre-Islamic origin, as in tiger-capturing rituals, shamans may even add Muslim prayers to achieve greater power, thus combining sets of beliefs to reach the invisible world.27 Peh ("Beaten") instruments of the pre-Islamic associated stream The double-headed geundrang is the main drum in Aceh Besar, Pidie, Aceh Utara and elsewhere. Geundrang are usually played in pairs, sometimes together with a geundrang aneuk ("child drum", a small variant of a geundrang with a long, narrow shape that plays between the main tones on the geundrang) and a melodic instrument, most commonly a seurune (shawm). Other optional instruments may join the ensemble. A hundred years ago, the party of a person fulfilling a vow would be preceded in the procession to a holy tomb by a geundrang ensemble comprising a seurune, a pair of geundrang and an optional geundrang aneuk (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:260). Snouck also wrote that despite the most rigorous prohibition of musical instruments by Islamic religious 27 I have recorded songs with texts that combine white magic with Muslim prayers in Aceh and West Sumatra. For the latter, see Kartomi 1976.</page><page sequence="13">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 37 law, the Acehnese believed that the saints were honoured by musical performances such as these, and that members of such ensembles usually played in various processions and atpiasan (family feasts) (ibid). Nowadays, this ensemble is mostly used to accompany the pre-Islamic and secular genres, including a kaoi (ceremony) to cure a sick person or to celebrate a child's first turun ke tanah (B.I., (lit. "going down to the earth") ceremony outside the home, or a comic sketch between the drummer and a male singer-dancer wearing female clothes (Isjkarim et al 1980-81:58). The ensemble may also accompany a pair of solo pant6n singers' responses to each other, or chaperoned female welcome dances at a celebration, or provide musical items to enliven a night market or government celebration. The body of the geundrang is made from a hollowed-out trunk of a jackfruit tree (figure 1). The heads are tautened across its body by cross-lacing of buffalo hide, with two diagonal layers near each end and parallel horizontal lacing in the middle. A good drummer must have highly developed rhythmic skills and be able to produce varied timbres and a beautiful sound quality (mangat that su, "very sweet sound"). A pair of drummers mostly produces strict-metred textures that range from soft, slow repetitive rhythms to brilliant, fast jagged or interlocking rhythms. If the player is standing or walking in a procession, he suspends the drum around his neck with a leather cord. If he is sitting cross-legged, he rests the drum on his left foot or a small metal block for a firm hold and more resonant sound. He beats the cow-skin right head with a curved wooden stick and the thinned goat-skin left head with the fingers of his left hand. If played in ensemble with a seurune, the drums follow its tempo, rhythm and melodic line closely (Isjkarim et al, 1980-81:58). 60 - 65 cm Figure 1. A geundrang (doubled-headed Acehnese drum). Drawing: Gary Swinton after a sketch in Burhan et al, 1986-87: 50. An hourglass drum, geudumba, was formerly an important instrument, especially in the Pidie region, though it is rare today. One or more pairs of players accompanied recitations of pant6n by a female dancer-singer and a buffoon (peunari), sometimes joining in the singing, with a hareubab player. The drum's jackfruit-wood body is about 27 cm high; and its c. 13-cm. goatskin</page><page sequence="14">38 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC head, is fastened to the body by rattan string stretched over wooden wedges (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:260-61). Xylophones called canang ceureukeh or seureukeh are played in a few areas, mainly by Acehnese women in the ricefield after work or at home, for example, while lulling a child to sleep.28 In the Jeuleukat area of kecamatan (sub district) Kuta Makmur in North Aceh, girls commonly beat a four- to six-key canang ceureukeh with a stick to accompany a wooden or rice-stalk shawm called a seurune or moh-moh. The xylophone's tuned hardwood keys rest on a wooden base (figure 2) or a pair of parallel banana stems (figure 3) to increase the resonance. If a rice-stalk shawm is used it has a rice-stalk reed and a thin bamboo tubular body with a wound coconut-leaf bell at its end. Isjkarim et al (1980-81: 71) mention that this ensemble was almost obsolete at the time of writing. In the Sibungke area of southern kabupaten Singkil, the slightly different canang ceureukeh is made of a local hardwood (called betak or capet in the Singkil dialect); it produces a sweet, high-pitched sound when beaten. After tuning its seven or nine keys (c. 27-30 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm) by shaving the middle part of their lower surface (the thicker the key the higher the pitch), the maker ties them together with cords on each side, and carves a pair of wooden beaters. Its female players sit and arrange the keys on their legs from their laps to their feet and beat out traditional Singkil tunes in unison or in interlocking patterns, sometimes with a melodic line played on a wooden or rice-stalk clarinet. In kabupaten Pidie, the canang trieng ("bamboo-ophone") is made from a mature bamboo stalk cut from the middle of its length, with keys measuring 40-50 cm in length by 10-12 cm in diameter and with their back parts cut according to the desired tuning. Women play it resting on their lap and legs in the ricefield or at home, either solo or with singing (Burhan et al 1986-87:35-7). Figure 2. A canang seureukeh or ceureukeh. Photo: H.

A canang seureukeh player with a moh-mnoh (shawm) player. Drawing: Iwan Dzulvan Amir after a sketch in lsjkarim et al, 1980-81: 71. An instrument that is regarded as being as old as rice-growing itself in Aceh, is the rice-stamping percussion instrument called alee tunjang (lit., rice stamping pole, also the name of the dance-song genre), made from a banyan or other tree trunk (Aboe Bakar et al 2001:1016) and believed to have developed in the former royal area of Buloh Blang Ara in Aceh Utara (Isjkarim et al 1980-81: 64). It was traditionally played after a harvest by women who had to spend many nights stamping husks off the grain, each holding a long wooden pole to beat into the truncated conical wooden trough (figure 4), unlike the long troughs used in Java. The women lighten their task by converting it into an artistic genre that was performed by unmarried girls at outdoor mystical ceremonies (for the rice goddess) held when the moon was full, as well as at certain other ceremonies (Isjkarim et al. 1980-81: 64-6, Aboe Bakar et al 2001:16). It is still performed by groups of unmarried women, albeit in newly choreographed dances, in Aceh Utara and Pidie (figure 5), now sometimes accompanied by a vocalist singing about the associated legend, as well as drums, frame drums, a solo wind instrument, and an optional gong (Isjkarim, ibid).</page><page sequence="16">40 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Figure 4.

Made of buffalo horn or hollowed wood, it is found in Aceh Besar, Pidie, and Aceh Utara and some other areas of Aceh (Burhan et al 1986-87:26-7, Aboe Bakar et al 2001:76). A hole made at the narrow end is widened and smoothed out to form the mouthpiece, after which the player takes a deep breath to produce a long held, penetrating sound, the amplitude of which is magnified by the body of the horn, which serves as its bell.

Yub ("Blown") instruments of the pre-Islamic associated stream A number of other instruments made of perishable plant materials are also associated with the ancient animist or syncretic animist-Hindu stratum, especially those made of bamboo (buloh), which grows profusely in many varieties and sizes and has served for millennia as a major element of the material culture. All Acehnese tunes, for example, those to which panton verses are set, are still popularly played on the duct flute called bangsi (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:258), bansi or bensi (Burhan et al 1986-87:24). Measuring c. 35 x 2 cm., they are made of thick bamboo, have seven round upper finger holes and one lower hole, and produce a "sweet-toned" (merdu), "happy, agreeable" (seronok) sound (B.I., Burhan et al, 1986-87:25-6). The same tunes are also played on the end-blown, six-hole flute called suleng, which is made of a piece of thin bamboo cut to about 30-40cm in length, with a large duct-flute blowing hole at the open end and a natural node closing the other end. In the late nineteenth century the bangsi were preferably made from the igeui variety of bamboo, with decorative silver or copper bands encircling the instrument at both ends, and played either solo or in processions, animal fight openings or kite contests and at certain festivities (piasan) with a hand drum (tambu) and a pair of copper discs (canang)2&lt; (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:258). 29 Metal canang are obsolete in Aceh-speaking areas today, found only in the Gayo highlands, and are therefore not included in the Classification in Chart 1.</page><page sequence="18">42 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Varieties of shawm (seurune) are still played throughout Aceh), but the seurune kalee, literally "a clarinet from Kalee", a village in Laweueng Kabupaten Pidie (ldris et al 1993:47), is by far the best-known wind instrument (figure 7). Associated with a "masculine" sound, it has an idioglot reed which is said to symbolise a heroic male voice and a dynamic spirit; its sharp, penetrating tone never needs amplification by microphone in an arena (Idris et al 1993:74-50, Burhan et al 1986-87:81). Using the technique of circular breathing and right hand upper fingering and left hand lower fingering for its seven front finger holes and one back hole, the finest players produce a highly ornamented melodic line with microtones and whole tones ranging over an ambitus of a fourth or a fifth (maximally, an octave), producing a stream of piercing, breathless sound for minutes on end. Seurune vary considerably in size and shape but essentially all produce a similar loud, piercing reedy sound. Lipai _ .._Brass plate 'Back hole Upper finger hole 3 cm 0 Figure 7. An Acehnese seurune kalee (shawm). Drawing: Gary Swinton after sketches in Burhan et al, 1986-87: 82. Formerly it was played at ceremonies based purely on pre-Islamic adat (traditional customs), but since most Acehnese were converted to Islam, the seurunet kale has also been played at adat ceremonies that include Muslim prayers. Thus, the seurune kale may be classified under both the Islamic and the pre-Islamic strata. It accompanies guest welcoming dances, circumcision celebrations, weddings, the ceremonial cleansing of a baby (B.I., mandi anak, "wash a baby"), and ceremonies to mark the official opening of a home, building</page><page sequence="19">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 43 or project (ldris et al 1993:54) and, in post-colonial times, in government-run arts festivals. To construct the single-tubular body of a seurune kalee, the maker cuts a metre length of matured hardwood, usually from the trunk of a jackfruit tree, and buries it in some mud for about three months, after which he removes the bark, trims the wood to the desired length (the instrument drawn in figure 7 measures c. 34 cm in length and has a 3 cm-wide bell), bores a c. 2 cm hole in the middle, and shapes the instrument. 30 From the narrow single-reed mouthpiece the body should flare outwards, gradually at first and then more steeply as it approaches the bell, which should have a bottom diameter of 3-7 cm. The maker may add ornamental carvings or silver plating to the bell's external surface. Then he burns out the finger holes with a hot iron knife, inserts a sliced piece of bamboo (lipai) into the mouthpiece, attaches the brass plate near the mouth for strength and to ornament its appearance, and makes the reed from a kind of lontar tree leaf (on theue), choosing one that is not too thick.3' No two specimens are exactly the same in form or colour, though most good exemplars are dark brown or black in colour, due to the natural tonings of the hardwood and the instrument's constant handling. In West Aceh, seurune are usually smaller and often have a coconut shell plate. The seurune from the Gayo area, shown for comparison in figure 8, has only six front holes but is basically a similar instrument. ._ Lipai _ r - Carved wood Back hole E E E t Nangka wood T 3 cm 0 Figure 8.

It was commonly played at various feasts and in vow-fulfilling ceremonies, for example, when a parent prays that if his child is cured, he will show God his gratitude by making a pilgrimage, for example, to the tombstone of Aceh's great saint, Teungku di Kuala Abdora'oh (Abdurauf) of Singkel, or the holy Sayyid Teungku Anjong, buried in Gampong Jawa (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 1:390). To this day, the instrument is still usually played with a pair of large and small geundrang and a pair of rapa'i at celebrations and ceremonies, although it can also be played solo or even with the great rapa'i Pase frame drums. Idris et al (1993:56) mention an "ideal" ensemble in the 1980s comprising a seurune kalee, a buloh meurindu, eight rapa'i, two geundrang, and four rapa'i Pase combined with a saxophone, clarinet, drum and bass guitar. Complementing the "masculine"-associated tone of the seurune kalee is the soft, "feminine"-toned buloh meurindu (lit. "bamboo [pipe expressing] to long for"); both are said to have been "inherited from the ancestors" (Idris et al 1993:73), and to symbolise male and female heroism respectively. The buloh meurindu (figure 9) plays melodies of songs about longing for love or freedom, heroism, war, religion, legends and so on. According to tradition, the buloh meurindu resembles a heroine standing up; and the tone it produces is said to symbolise a woman's voice (Idris et al 1993:73). So, its metaphorical meaning may be expressed in analogical form as follows: "the buloh meurindu is to the female voice as a heroine is to victory". Made of a rare, thin variety of bamboo found only in the mountains, it has a funnel-shaped buffalo horn resonator attached at the lower end. The embouchure comprises a single idioglot reed cut near the top, over which a double funnel-shaped leaf flare is placed. The inset in figure 9 (based on Idris et al, 1993:73-6), shows an enlargement of the embouchure, with an air hole and a slightly shaven tongue or notch under the flare. As the six finger holes are only approximately equidistant, the pitches produced are variable, depending also on whether they are directly or obliquely fingered. A good player (players are normally male) needs to be able to breathe in deeply, store inhaled air in his cheeks and breathe out very slowly, using the technique of circular breathing. His controlled breathing allows him to produce long streams of melody, with ornamentation, based on melodic formulae (as yet unstudied). Besides strong lungs he needs good teeth with which to manage the embouchure. Whether playing solo or in ensemble, he may be performing while walking in procession, standing, or sitting cross-legged on a mat.</page><page sequence="21">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 45 10 cm 16 cm 15cm p pcm Internal mouthpiece hole ~(thin bamboo hole ~~notch) Figure 9.

Geusok ("Bowed') instruments of the pre-Islamic associated stream This sub-category of string instruments, believed to be of pre-Islamic origin, contains only one exemplar, the hareubab (figure 10), although the biola Aceh ("Acehnese violin") is arguably a borderline instrument that belongs in both pre Islamic and Western streams (see figure 11I and discussion below). Until a few decades ago, the now obsolete bowed, spike, string instrument called hareubab was played solo or with a pair of geudumbak (hourglass drums) to accompany the singing of pant6n verses (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:260-61) by a male and a "female" singer (the latter a man in female dress), who sang humorous songs fro hkayt tores32 Th akri-wood soundboard (bruek) of the hareubab was covered with buffalo-stomach skin, over which three twisted silk strings were stretched across a lead bridge (capeing) from the lower part of the skin to the upper tuning pegs (gase'ng). Its bow, made of stretched root fibres of the sriphie tree stretched loosely on a rattan frame, was tautened by the player's fingers while playing. A photograph of a man playing a hareubab is shown with a boy dancer dressed in female attire in Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:261 .' The term"t play" the instrument is peh hareubab, while the terms "to bow" are gisJng hareubab or geusok hareubab (Aboe Bakar et al 2001: 282). 32 Burhan et al (1986-87:19) give the name of the Acehnese bowed string instrument as arbab, which is actually the name of a Batak bowed string instrument. His mistake is not surprising as he has never seen a hareubab: as he writes, the instrument has not been played in Acehnese society since before the Japanese invasion. 331 have seen samples of the hareubab in the Museum voor Volkenkunde in Leiden.</page><page sequence="22">46 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Figure 10.

Kartomi, Lhokseumawe, 1982.</page><page sequence="23">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 47 As with the Central and West Javanese bowed string rebab, the organological parts of the Acehnese hareubab may have had anthropomorphic names attached to them for its "head", body", feet" and so on, but if so, knowledge of these terms has not been recorded. Other instruments, such as the sulng flute, may also have had a metaphorical meaning attached, as in some neighbouring regions where it is compared to the male organ. Pet ("plucked") instruments of the pre-Islamic associated stream The jew's harp (genggong, wa), made of palm-wood, rice stalk, bamboo, brass or iron, is one of the plucked instruments of probable ancient origin. Decades ago it was played in Aceh by both children and adults (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:258 ), but it is now found only in Gayo (where it is called po-po) and Alas (Burhan et al 1986-87:46-481). In his description of an iron-frame genggong measuring 3 x 5 cm from Blangkejeren (figure 12), Burhan writes that after the player places the instrument between his upper and lower lips, he continually plucks its protruding tongue or prong with his right hand fingers to make it vibrate, thus producing a humming sound that is reinforced by his breath. The main sound is a drone on the main frequency, but the player can produce a melody by changing the size of his mouth cavity and tongue movement so that the overtones become audible, with or without mouthing words. According to tradition, the genggong serves as a means of secret communication between lovers, for its players can very quietly transmit not only melodies but also mouthed word messages. ~~~GENZOGNG Figure 12. A genggong (jew's harp). Drawing: Iwan Dzulvan Amir after a sketch in Burhan et al, 1986-87: 48. Another plucked instrument is the idiochord tube zither named kecapi oloh (figure 13), or taganing in Gayo and kacapi bambu in Alas. In Aceh it has four strings (three and five respectively in Gayo and Alas) that are prised out of its thick bamboo surface and are tautened by a bamboo bridge at the ends of each string. Its rod or u-shaped sound hole measures three quarters of its length. The player beats the strings with two thin wooden sticks in interlocking rhythm, or two to four players (mostly female) play with one stick each.</page><page sequence="24">48 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC 12- 15cm0 I I~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gong . _ I O 8 tK ~~ekepalk Tingkah Figure 13.

The Islamic-associated stream of instruments-varieties of frame drums and drums There is only one category of inanimate instruments in the second, masa Islam (Islamic era or stream) associated category of instruments in Chart 1, namely the peh (beaten). It includes the many variants of the rapa'i frame drums, the single headed mosque drum (tambo) and its small variant (also called tambo) played in standing position or while carried in processions; and the transplanted Indian single-headed drum (geundrang klng). By far the most important musical instruments associated with Islam in Aceh between the nineteenth and the twenty-first centuries (but probably also in earlier centuries) are members of the frame drum (rapa'i) family including the rapa'i Past (large to very large), rapa'i daboh (medium-large), rapa'i geurimpheng (medium), rapa'i pulot (medium), and the tiny dap (or dab, from the Ar. duff).34 The rapa'i is probably named after the twelfth century saint Syeh Ahmed Rifa'i (d. 1182) who founded the Rifa'iyah brotherhood in twelfth century Arabia, from whence it spread widely, including in Aceh (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 1:63, 49). These frame drums are believed by some Acehnese ulama to have been transplanted, with Islam itself, from Arabia and neighbouring Islamic countries to the first Muslim kingdoms in thirteenth century Aceh (though given that they are known to have existed in the third millennium BCE, 34 For drawings of each member of the rapa 7 family, see Kartomi 2004: 82-7.</page><page sequence="25">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 49 the rapa'i could also have developed from pre-Islamic Acehnese music culture or external contact). By all accounts and as already mentioned, as Islam spread throughout Aceh from the late twelfth to the seventeenth centuries, leading missionaries passed on the orthodox Islamic view that musical instruments should not be used in worship, but that frame drums and body movement/percussion were acceptable, indeed should be relished, as a means of spreading religious knowledge and of promoting established expressions of fervent emotional attachment to God, Muhammad and the other prophets outside the mosques. Thus, frame drums, and by extension, other drums, and even the clarinet seurune (associated otherwise with "animist-Hindu" belief), were played in processions to fulfil a pilgrim's religious vows to visit a tomb of the saints (Snouck Hurgronje 1906 11:266). In both the colonial and the post-colonial period, frame drums also became a standard adjunct to the geundrang/seurune ensembles used to accompany traditional and modern secular dances. Sufi devotional practices associated at a village level with the above-mentioned brotherhoods-during which participants read phrases from the holy book aloud, sang religious texts or songs of praise or repeated the names of Allah and the prophets many times while enthusiastically playing their frame drums (rapa'i)-were and remain very popular, enjoyable experiences on both the devotional and artistic fronts. Devotional genres such as rapa 'i daboh and ratoh duek feature fast and furious rapa'i playing and singing for hours on end until the participants' bodies are bathed in sweat and they achieve a sense of samak (communion) with God. The metaphorical meaning of Islamic-associated instruments such as the rapa'i daboh lies in the belief that playing them in group devotional exercises brings both performers and listeners closer to Allah; expressed analogically (a:b::c:d), this statement becomes: the rapa'i daboh is to devotional exercises as human closeness is to Allah. The rapa'i Pase is the most highly respected musical instrument in the culture (figure 14). Made from a rill-carved, sawn-off tree trunk with a skin head measuring up to a metre in diameter, its metaphorical meaning lies in the people's attribution to it of "pre-Islamic" (Daham 2003) mystical qualities derived from its antiquity and from the way it is made. A pair of shamans perform a series of animist-Hindu rituals throughout the long making process: from the time they sail upstream to obtain the necessary rare forest products while invoking and contacting the spirits of the invisible world (makhluk gaib), to the bestowing of a proper name (for example, Putroe Ijo [the mythical Green Princess]) on each specimen. Once made, the drum is believed to house ancestral and nature spirits and thus to be able to create a nexus between the spirit world and its new human owner or player(s), and is treasured as an heirloom. The rapa'i Pase is traditionally played nowadays in competitive festivals. It may also be played by a shaman in a ritual in order to heal a patient or provide clairvoyant advice to someone. This may be expressed in analogical (a:b::b:c) form as: "the shaman is to the rapa 'i Pase as veneration is to the divine".</page><page sequence="26">50 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC sun ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~oe s l d n t~~~~~Cwe end Ratoh (rattan piee) inerted inside cirumfence of head for lautening Figure 14. A rapa'i Pase (large to medium-large frame drum). Drawing: Gary Swinton after a photograph by H. Kartomi, Jakarta, 2003. Other instruments associated with Islam include the small, single headed tambo drum, played mainly in western Aceh to augment the geundrang ensemble and to call people together for village business meetings in a meunasah (village meeting house). In the past three decades, the tambo has also been used to augment ensembles in newly created music and dance items (for example, two tracks on my 1998 Compact Disk feature a pair of small tambo played with a seurune, canang [Gayo kettle gong] and a tambrin [tambourine]) (see Kartomi 1998). Sizes of tambo are variable, but the specimen from Blangpidie in South Aceh shown in figure 15 (based on Burhan et al 1986-87:74) measures 32 cm in diameter and 52 cm in length. Its body is made from iboih (fan palm tree) wood and cowskin and it has rattan lacing. The large tambo single-headed buffalo-skin drums in the mosques, made of buffalo skin and a sawn-off wooden tree trunk are not used as musical instruments but for sending rhythmic signal messages within and between villages. When beaten they may emit such a powerful sound that they can be heard several kilometres away. 52 cm Figure 15. A tambo (double-headed drum).

Its buffalo- or cow-hide skins are tautened by triangle-shaped rattan lacing over its jackfruit-wood body, with heads measuring about 20-22 cm in diameter and body about 30-32 cm in length (see figure 16). During my 1982 fieldtrip in Sigli, musicians who claimed descent from Indian Sepoy (B.I., orang Sipahi) soldiers showed me several geundrang kleng, saying that they had played them until the late 1970s in Syiah tabut processions held annually in the streets when official permission was granted (permission was, however, frequently refused). Their story rang true. The British colonial power brought many Sepoys from India to Bengkulu (southwest Sumatra) in the late seventeenth century to build and maintain their fort there. When British power left Bengkulu in 1824, the Sepoys settled in at least fourteen towns around Sumatra's coast. These so called orang kling (B.I), who were Syiah believers, introduced the colorful North Indian form of the tabut ceremony. Lasting from the first to the tenth day of the month of Muharam, it commemorates what Syiahs believe were the untimely deaths of the prophet Muhammad's rightful heirs, his grandsons Hasan and Husen. In addition, an all-night comic geundrang kleng song-dance genre was performed until the 1950s in Kecamatan Simpang Tiga, Kampung/Desa Mantok, Pidie. Male "couples", one member of whom played the role of a male and the other of a female wearing female dress, performed comic dance movements and sang risque dialogue to the audience's amusement (Idris et al 1993:63).35 In procession, each player suspended it with a leather cord around his neck as he beat it by hand, but players now normally beat it sitting cross-legged, resting it on a foot. It is still widely used in several kabupaten to augment the dominant Acehnese geundrang-seurune kalee ensemble or to accompany dances. 20 - 22 cm 0 Figure 16. A geundrang kleng (lit. "Indian drum").

The genre was said to have originated in India (lauset al 1993:63-4).</page><page sequence="28">52 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Meukaphe - the Western associated stream of instruments As noted above, for the sake of completeness a third socio-historical stream or stratum of instruments needed to be included in Chart 1. The earliest-known and longest-lasting adaptation of a European instrument by Acehnese musicians is the violin, called biola Aceh ("Acehnese violin"). The biola Aceh somewhat resembles a large European viola, but the player rests it on his upper breast rather than his shoulder and he tunes at least two of its four strings to a viola-like range (see figure 11).36 From the early days of their empire in Southeast Asia, the Portuguese probably brought quantities of musical instruments such as guitars and bowed strings-possibly alto violins called viola in Portuguese and biola in Malay (Goldsworthy 1979:421) with them to Malacca and other colonies.37 These instruments and associated playing skills then spread around coastal Sumatra and other (especially Malay-speaking) areas, where a number of syncretic Malay-Portuguese musical genres that include the biola (for example, kroncong and langgam Melayu) developed and remain extant to this day. European instruments are documented as having been played by seventeenth century slaves in the great colonial houses in Portuguese Macao (Boxer 1969:307) and Batavia (Boxer 1965:240). Philipe de Caverel wrote that ten thousand guitars went with the Portuguese to Morocco in 1582 (according to a reference in an Embassy report to Lisbon in 1582, see Pinto, 1969 [1653]). In Aceh, however, biola players did not play syncretic European-Malay melodies and implied harmonies, as occurred in neighbouring Malay-speaking areas. Acehnese biola players perform in an ornamented melodic style that resembles that of the now obsolete hareubab (pers.comm. from the musician H. Husin Amin in Samalanga, 1982). Current recordings of the playing of biola Aceh artists clearly indicate their strong stylistic resemblance to the traditional Acehnese vocal style of hikayat story-singers. Indeed, traditionally a biola Aceh player (called the syeh, leader) doubled as a vocalist to accompany a pair of comic dancers (pelawak, B.I.) named Linto Baro (a man) and Dara Baro (a man dressed as a woman). The three-artist troupe entertained at weddings and other functions, with the comic actors dancing to the melodies played or sung by the biola player, engaging in couple's dialogue, telling stories, and improvising humorous, witty or clever answers to each others' singing of pant6n (Isjkarim et al 1980-81:72-3). Sometimes a rapa'i was added to the ensemble (Burhan et al 36 For a photograph of a player of a large, handmade biola, tuned like a viola and held on the upper breast while bowing it in Manna, Sumatra, see Kartomi 1985:26. 37 The Portuguese brought bowed instruments with four strings (probably alto violas) called viola, which became known as biola in local Indonesian languages, to their sixteenth-century colony in Malacca, from whence they spread throughout the archipelago. Goldsworthy (1979:421) wrote that as the violin had been developed in Italy about 1550 and was probably used in the Iberian peninsula from the early seventeenth century, it probably replaced the earlier alto violin in Southeast Asia from the seventeenth century. As Acehnese and other Sumatran biola are larger than violins and tuned about a fifth lower, it is likely that the earliest bowed strings brought to Southeast Asia by the Portuguese were indeed alto violas. Marsden (1966 [1811]: 195-6) referred to the violin on North Sumatra's west coast in 1783, but did not specify its tuning or size.</page><page sequence="29">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 53 1986-87:27). Though somewhat rare these days, the biola Aceh is still played; more significantly, commercial recordings of it are listened to in Aceh today, where it is regarded as one of the special symbols of Acehnese identity. Even if it is European-derived, Acehnese artists who adapted it over several centuries rightly regard it as their own authentic instrument. In the past half century, instruments of Western or global commercial popular culture, such as electric guitars, electronic keyboards, drum kits, bongos, saxophones and so on, have become increasingly popular among young Acehnese artists, who have adapted them to various international styles and added Acehnese language song texts and melodies. Regarded as secular metaphors of modernity or globalisation to some, and of moral depravity to others, these instruments belong to social contexts in which popular Malay music (for example, langgam Melayu, "Malay songs") and popular band music are enjoyed. Conclusion At the most general level, the main Acehnese musical analogies operate as a bond between humanly created instrumental or body-percussive sounds or music and the invisible cosmic world, just as the Greek philosopher Plato postulated a musical analogy as the bond of the cosmic elements in the World Soul of the Timaeus, which was identified as a particular proportion called analogia (Pont 1991:194). In classifying their corpus of instruments, Acehnese artists and writers do not use the Western threefold division of winds, strings and percussion, mainly because such a division would not reflect the dominant concept of instruments, nor express any of the varied concepts of instruments mentioned above. The classification schemes in Chart 1 should be viewed as terse presentations of a whole metaphorical way of thinking about their instruments by Acehnese artists and writers, who link them to socio-historical associations that go toward making up their concept of identity. Although most Acehnese wind, string and percussion instruments, including those that are now rare or obsolete, resemble those found throughout other parts of Indonesia,38 each instrument is associated with an origin legend and is attributed with metaphorical meanings grouped into (i) the "animist-Hindu" stream of belief that their ancestors are thought to have adhered to over at least the past eight centuries, and (ii) the Islamic stream, dating in popular belief back to the thirteenth-century, Muslim Pase and Peureulak kingdoms, with elements of both streams persisting to this day, either in separate form or in syncretic combination. To these two categories, I have added a third, Western-associated category of instruments that Acehnese play and include in their thinking about instruments. Ideas inherent in the classification (Chart 1) compactly express the way Acehnese artists and writers group their instruments at the most general level and in everyday speech, 38 Although Acehnese do not play some instruments that are important elsewhere in the archipelago, such as the great gong, gong-chime and zither.</page><page sequence="30">54 2005 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC including the way in which the instruments produce sounds, which forms the second character of division in the scheme. Analogies between Acehnese instruments, their players and the associated religious beliefs and expressions are found in the writings of Burhan, Idris and Isjkarim, each of whom led teams of artists in Aceh to research and write about the instruments, their functions, and their metaphorical meanings. They take note that even some devout Muslims believe that human-spirit contact can occur through rituals which provide a safe social framework for controlled passage under the guidance of a shaman, and that music-making is one of the main strategies employed for this purpose. To this day, the rapa'i Pase and the geundrang drums are associated with shamanic ritual and trance possession, attributed with extraordinary powers that are believed to be able to create a nexus between the human world and the spirit world, as a by-product of the close association between music, the ancestors and other spirits. This may be expressed in analogical form (a:b as c:d) as "the shaman is to the drum as human veneration is to the divine/the macrocosm, or the cosmic journey," where "divine" means the inhabitants of the invisible world ("invisible beings", makhluk gaib), including Muslim saints (wali), ancestral spirits (e'ntu, endatu), forest sprites (mambang), ghosts (uin), celestial spirits (dewa), and various animal spirits (for example, seumangat rimueng, tiger spirit).39 Acehnese musical instruments are associated with metaphorical meanings that include gender and class. Other associations occur at a more specific level; for example, some drums and frame drums occur in pairs, such as the geundrang (two-headed drum) and its small counterpart, the geundrang aneuk (child drum); the rapa'i also has its "child" variant, the rapa'i aneuk or dap. Here the analogy lies between the large and small instrument on the one hand and a parent and child on the other. Although Acehnese people classify their instruments according to the manner in which they excite sound, which is a widespread characteristic of classifications across the world (Kartomi 1990:277), metaphors are implicit in their main classification, which divides instruments at the most general level according to whether they have pre-Islamic, Islamic or Western associations, and includes borderline cases of instruments that may straddle two of these three categories. Concepts and classifications of instruments in Aceh, then, possess both commonalities and culture-specific characteristics. 39 Acehnese drums may be compared with the ketobung drum of the Petalangan people in Riau, south of Aceh. The metaphorical meaning of the ketobung, expressed analogically, is "the drum rhythms are to the shaman's dance (the microcosm) as the voice of a deity is to the cosmic journey (macrocosm)". The Petalangan people include among inhabitants of the invisible realm Muslim saints, ancestral spirits, forest sprites, ghosts, celestial spirits and a host of animal spirits, the most powerful of which is the tiger spirit (Turner 1991:125-8).</page><page sequence="31">KARTOMI MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACEH 55 Epilogue While writing this article, I learned that many artists and their families and countrymen and women were horribly affected by the series of earthquakes and massive incursions of giant waves of the sea that hit large parts of the coastline of Aceh on 26 December 2004, and again on its western coast and offshore islands on 21 March 2005. The tsunamis wreaked devastation right around the Indian Ocean, but Aceh was closest to the epicentre, and suffered an enormous loss of life, with utter misery in store for those who survived. Aceh's offshore islands and west coast suffered another great earthquake on 21 March. This article is dedicated to the people of all walks of life in Aceh in their great suffering, including the artists about whom I have had the honour to write, and who are now trying to maintain their culture despite the great damage suffered.
