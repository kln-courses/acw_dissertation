         <p>IN 1905, the eighty-two-year-old Alfred Russel Wallace—presumably
short of funds, as he had been throughout his life—sought a
buyer for his inventory of “foreign coleoptera.” He consulted
a respected entomologist, David Sharp, who reported that possible
purchasers were “an almost extinct form of life in this country.”
Sharp knew of only one likely customer: a Frenchman who frequently
visited London, who had previously bought collections from the naturalist
traveling companion of Wallace's youth, Henry Walter Bates.1 As young men, Wallace and Bates had
earned their livings gathering specimens for sale. By the end of Wallace's
long lifetime, however, the scientific market that had once sustained
him was collapsing because a fundamental reorganization of scientific
work was under way. The erstwhile division of labor between collectors
and theorists was eroding: the once-separate tasks of accumulating
and interpreting evidence were increasingly likely to be joined in
the persons of professionals—formally trained and formally employed
scientists.2</p>
         <p>For the young Wallace and Bates, career decisions were compounded
of both scientific and commercial considerations. They had an agent,
Samuel Stevens, who attended to both. While they were in foreign parts,
Stevens sent them scientific reading materials to guide their activities.
He also asked potential buyers what they should collect; displayed
their finds at meetings of learned societies and published advertisements
for them; sought to stimulate market demand by having their letters
from the field reproduced in natural history journals; insured their
trophies during shipment, sparing them catastrophic losses; and invested
their profits. Wallace and Bates were at the high end of a social
scale of naturalists who served a congeries of gentleman-scientists.
Representing a transitional life form among scientists, they were
accepted to a degree—but only to a degree—in elite scientific
circles; although Bates (unlike Wallace) managed to find employment
as a scientist—as Assistant Secretary of the Royal Geographical
Society—it is notable that his paid work was limited to the
lowly tasks of classification and editing.3</p>
         <p>Wallace and Bates's story, like many others in my narrative,
is drawn from the history of naturalists based in Britain. But the
developments I identify were not peculiar to scientists in that country.
Moreover, methodological changes in British sociocultural anthropology,
which constitute my major case, affected practitioners worldwide.4 Overall, the professional collector
approached extinction as the status of the fieldworker rose. In explaining
how the experience of fieldwork gained prestige among Western scientists
of various types, historians and sociologists of science have found
decisive moments from the early modern period to the recent past.
Nevertheless, as I show in this essay, a qualitatively distinct shift
occurred in the second half of the nineteenth century. I describe
how and why armchair scholars, who relied on evidence gathered by
others, ceased to be credible; how the reliable scientific fieldworker
was defined; and the relationship between field methods and concepts.</p>
         <p>Until the latter half of the nineteenth century, armchair scholars
were accustomed to claiming the intellectual high ground. Although
such pioneering intellectual giants of comprehensive natural history
as Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin had earlier made journeys
of observational exploration, theorizing was largely the province
of armchair scholars. Reviewing one of Humboldt's works in 1807,
Georges Cuvier pronounced the field naturalist's observations “broken
and fleeting,” while, by contrast, the “sedentary naturalist”
was able to survey all available reports and “compare them with
each other as often as necessary to reach reliable conclusions.”5 Sometimes the collectors who served
scholars undertook commissions. Others responded to the instructions
that scholars broadcast to travelers, requests for specimens that
the latter might chance upon while pursuing their regular occupations:
collectors could be drawn from any walk of life. But because their
labors could be physically arduous, in dirty and dangerous places
(both close to home and far away), fieldworkers were often accorded
low status. Indeed, some collectors were coerced participants in science,
among them nineteenth-century Australian prisoners and slaves purchased
for the specific purpose of gathering specimens.6 And persons who earned their livings as collectors
did not invariably identify themselves as scientific workers, not
least because their clients frequently represented commercial interests.7 Thus collectors' contributions
were often rendered invisible, however important they were for scientific
judgments: the mid-nineteenth-century paleontological feud between
Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, for example, was understood
by their contemporaries—and is generally understood today—as
a conflict between the two men, although they (especially Marsh) were
dependent on intelligence transmitted by informants in the field.8</p>
         <p>We can understand disdain for the collector's task: life in
the field could be grim. Consider the adventures of a relatively obscure
explorer, Karl Mauch, who figured among a number of variously financed
mid-nineteenth-century German naturalists whose reports from foreign
parts fed the middle classes' growing appetite for “vicarious
natural history adventuring.” An erstwhile secondary school
teacher who roamed southern Africa in the late 1860s and early 1870s,
Mauch supported himself with his savings as well as the meager funds
raised for him by the proprietor of the popular German geography magazine
that published news of his exploits. His achievements included compiling
topological and geological maps and finding two goldfields, but in
1871 he earned his place in history for an archaeological find: the
ruined stone structures soon to be known as Great Zimbabwe, which
had been the stuff of legend in Britain and the Continent since the
early sixteenth century, imagined as vestiges of the biblical city
of Ophir, the headquarters of King Solomon's fabulous gold mines.
Mauch was the first European to locate and describe the ruins for
a European audience, after searching for them for more than three
years—frequently hungry, cold, exhausted, and sick; stumbling
in his disintegrating shoes and relying on faulty instruments; often
collapsing in tears; resenting his dependence on his African servants
and guides, who were none too trustworthy and prone to decamp; and
fearing that, as one of but a few Europeans then present in the area
of his explorations, he was “threatened with murder at every
moment” by Africans who had lately acquired powerful firearms.9 His was an experience of a European
operating on a colonial frontier (the area of his explorations did
not become a colonial possession—and then one of a peculiar
sort—until 1889, when Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa
Company gained title to it with a royal charter).10</p>

Today, commercial collectors can earn considerable sums in the fossil

professionals in such enterprises as archaeology, astronomy, and ornithology.
And amateurs collect data for professionals in varieties of survey
research; see, e.g., the preparation of the <italic>Atlas of British
Flora</italic> (1962), described by Jon Agar, “What Difference
Did Computers Make?” <italic>Social Studies of Science</italic>, 2006, <italic>36</italic>:874–879. The conspicuous historical
exceptions to my generalizations were museum collectors in diverse
national contexts, who were trained and respected prior to—and
subsequent to—the reorganization of the natural history sciences
that I describe. For collectors in German museums, arguably the first
to professionalize fully, see H. Glenn Penny, “Traditions in
the German Language,” in <italic>A New History of Anthropology</italic>, ed. Henrika Kuklick (Malden, Mass.: Blackwell, 2008), pp. 79–95,

the association of the knowledgeable collector Emil Torday and the
British Museum was merely a “special relationship”; see

               <p>Unless otherwise specified, my references to “anthropology”
are to its sociocultural subspecies, not other subspecies (in the
United States, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and
archaeology; disciplinary arrangements vary from one country to another).
In Britain and British-influenced places, this was called “ethnology”
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; “cultural
anthropology,” “social anthropology,” and (sometimes) “sociology”
during the interwar period; and (usually) “social anthropology”
after the Association of Social Anthropologists was founded in 1946—an
event denoting the complete differentiation of its members' professional
lives, although the Royal Anthropological Institute (founded in 1871
as the Anthropological Institute) continued to incorporate all varieties
of anthropologists (and the differentiation of social anthropology
had been long in the making). In the United States and its intellectual
sphere of influence, the subspecialty has been called “cultural
anthropology” or “sociocultural anthropology.” Unless
a specific circumstance requires a specific reference, I use the term “sociocultural”
to refer to all variants. The word “ethnography” denotes
straightforward data collection. At different moments, there have
been distinctly different analytic emphases in different national
contexts. For example, as David Mills argues in <italic>Difficult
Folk? A Political History of Social Anthropology</italic> (New York:
Berghahn, 2008), the identification of explicitly <italic>British</italic> social anthropology originated with a 1951 dispute between the British
Raymond Firth and the American George Murdock in the pages of the <italic>American Anthropologist</italic>; British anthropologists' insistence
on their distinctiveness became especially intense during the 1960s
(see esp. pp. 25–26, 160–162). But the enterprise had
an international character at many moments prior to its mid-twentieth-century
squabbles, and it is arguably relatively international today.</p>

         <title>MEANS, MOTIVES, AND OPPORTUNITIES</title>
         <p>A number of historical changes conduced to the professionalization
of the field sciences, rendering amateurs' judgments noncredible.
As scientists themselves recognized, the expansion and consolidation
of empires—both formal and informal—provided them with
valuable sites for the prosecution of their inquiries.11 Colonial developments would have been impossible
without improved communications systems, as nineteenth-century statesmen
understood: the telegraph, increasingly efficient sea and road transport,
and newly laid railways both facilitated and followed pacification
of large portions of the globe by European powers. And with the subjugation
of territories came alterations in fieldworkers' experiences
as well as appreciation of their labors. Certainly, frontier conditions
did not disappear overnight. Often, an enlarged colonial presence
exacerbated intergroup hostilities; in the early days of formal colonial
rule, officials' authority could be precarious, and scientific
investigations could be quasi-military operations.12</p>
         <p>In effectively pacified places, however, European visitors anticipated
little difficulty in satisfying their needs for local assistants of
various types, ranging from local informants and translators to servants,
since they could rely on the authority of the colonial regime—threatened
or actual—to secure the personnel they required.13 (Note that the end of colonialism has to a degree
reinstituted the <italic>status quo ante</italic> in once-subject
territories, which have imposed various constraints on foreign field
scientists.)14 Pacified colonies
became important workplaces for all sorts of naturalists, if not the
only significant sites. Sociocultural anthropologists were distinguished
by their preference for them. (For anthropologists, easy access to
exotic places was loosely associated with conceptual change, and exclusive
attention to those peoples who were once unabashedly termed “primitive”
or “savage”—including subjects of internal colonialism,
such as Irish countrymen and Native Americans—could be justified
as the best way to identify human universals from observed particulars.)15 In colonial places, diverse types
of scientists anticipated that they might become famous after reporting
the novel phenomena they could expect to see. Sometimes, those who
came for other reasons developed scientific interests that led to
careers at home; more often, recently trained scientists found positions
that were stepping-stones to metropolitan careers (an occupational
path associated with the development of routinized scientific careers
in the metropoles).16 Scientists
were, in fact, just one among the many social types who enjoyed more
opportunities for self-promotion and self-aggrandizement in colonies
than were available at home.17</p>
         <p>The diverse expatriate types attracted to colonial places—including
(but not limited to) commercial figures, missionaries, and naturalists—could
support one another's endeavors. For example, when the future
anthropologist A. C. Haddon, then professor of zoology at the Royal
College of Science in Dublin, determined that he should make a year-long
research trip to an exotic locale to study marine biological phenomena
similar to those he had observed in Irish coastal waters, his personal
contacts were critical to his decision to go in 1888 to the islands
of the Torres Strait, near mainland Australia, then a British colony;
his wife's family had a friend who had until recently been stationed
at the London Missionary Society's outpost there, and Reverend
Macfarlane advised Haddon as to how he could set about living and
working there and wrote him letters of introduction to people who
could give him practical assistance. (When Haddon returned to the
Torres Strait a decade later, in his anthropological incarnation,
missionaries would object when he mobilized islanders to stage traditional
ceremonies that they wished to suppress; such conflicts between anthropologists
and missionaries were to become routine.)18 Franz Boas, the German-born and -trained future leader
of American anthropology, had a similar experience. Working on Baffin
Island in 1883–1884, when he was primarily in pursuit of geographical
information, he relied on a Scottish whaler, Jimmy Mutch, who had
been on the island since 1866 and was married to an Inuit woman. And
the rise of American paleontology to international preeminence by
1900 was considerably assisted by agents of transcontinental economic
expansion, such as employees of the American Fur Company and various
railroad companies.19</p>
         <p>As the trials of Karl Mauch indicate, scientists working under
frontier conditions could not survive (either literally or in their
research capacities) without the assistance of bearers of diverse
forms of local knowledge. Other narratives convey the same message
in less sensational fashion. Consider the first American attempts
to establish a boundary between the United States' Oregon Territory
and Canada, made in 1859; the 1866 report of the official survey party
noted that “almost all the first information of the topographical
features was also obtained by &amp; from Indians.” Likewise,
the young Boas mapped Baffin Island with the aid of geographical intelligence
elicited from Inuit informants.20 But fully established colonial societies became inward looking—a
development usually associated with conditions permitting the installation
of European nuclear families, who led lives approximating (at least
to some degree) those they would have expected to sustain at home.21 At this juncture, the extent to
which scientists availed themselves of locals' knowledge of the
natural world depended on a range of factors—from scientists'
ability to substitute already-routinized expertise for their own observations
to their personal attitudes and circumstances—although it has
remained in the self-interest of figures ranging from ornithologists
to sociocultural anthropologists to “develop natural resources,
so to speak,” as the anthropologist Sol Tax put it in 1934.22</p>
         <p>Also critical to the closing of the colonial frontier was the development
of tropical medicine. Practitioners of this new specialty were notably
effective in implementing public health measures; for example, they
reduced the incidence of insect-borne diseases by eliminating or treating
the pools of stagnant water in which insects bred, following the procedures
devised by Ronald Ross, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1902
for working out the mosquito–human vector in malaria transmission.
(Physicians were less successful in developing and promoting remedies
that were safe and effective. Although quinine had been used for centuries,
at the turn of the twentieth century an exotic traveler's medicine
chest was also likely to contain substances like arsenic, as Bronislaw
Malinowski's did at the time of World War I.)23 Although it took some time for new scientific
judgments to become conventional wisdom, changes in medical opinion,
as well as the implementation of practical sanitary measures, evidently
made life and work in the tropics more appealing to diverse colonial
types.24</p>
         <p>Finally, there were significant changes in metropolitan institutions
of higher learning. Universities added subjects to their curricula,
including the differentiated natural history sciences, which became
the bases of newly defined academic careers. (The work of laboratory-based
scientists, classicists, and philosophers—indeed, of practitioners
of knowledge-based occupations in general—also changed in the
late nineteenth century, but I will say no more along these lines;
comprehensive comparison is not the object of this essay.) Professional
naturalists became fieldworkers. Among the vanguard were marine biologists,
one of whom explained the necessity of fieldwork metaphorically: “the
idea of learning biology proper in a laboratory or a museum is as
preposterous as the idea of learning navigation from a toy ship on
a mill pond.”25 Programs
of field-based research were facilitated—if not necessarily
fully realized—with the creation of marine biological stations.
The first of these, founded in 1859 in Concarneau in Brittany, heralded
an efflorescence of European stations: ten were founded in the 1870s
(including the conspicuously successful Naples Zoological Station),
twenty in the 1880s, and eleven in the 1890s. In the United States,
particularly notable were two Massachusetts institutions: the short-lived
summer school on Penikese Island in Buzzard's Bay, run by the
brothers Louis and Alexander Agassiz, and the still-operating Marine
Biological Laboratory founded fifteen years later, in 1888, at Woods
Hole (then Woods Holl).</p>
         <p>Scientists resident at marine stations did not routinely immerse
themselves in unimproved nature: they lived and worked conveniently
near their live subjects but usually relied on organized teams of
fishermen to stock their laboratory tables; and their specimens were
sometimes cultivated rather than caught in the wild. But the division
of labor between scientists and collectors was neither absolute nor
invariant: for example, at the Naples station, where the emphasis
was on laboratory research, each scientist was furnished with a diving
suit that enabled him to accompany fishing expeditions and see his
creatures <italic>in situ</italic>; at Wimereau, near Lille, observations
in the field were of paramount importance.26 And at least some visitors to Naples were inspired to forsake
laboratories to examine aquatic life in natural habitats: A. C. Haddon,
for one, who had spent six months there following his graduation from
Cambridge with a First in Natural Sciences in 1879, determined that
he must make a marine biological field trip because the scientist
without firsthand investigative knowledge was “retailing second-hand
goods over the counter.”27</p>
         <p>Academic scientists such as Haddon enjoyed advantages not available
to amateurs who did science in their spare time. The university calendar
allowed for research at periodic intervals—during summer vacations—such
as that undertaken by the Oxford-trained Baldwin Spencer during the
Australian summer of 1896–1897, when he, the University of Melbourne's
foundation professor of biology, worked in Central Australia in collaboration
with the civil servant F. J. Gillen; their findings yielded <italic>The Native Tribes of Central Australia</italic> (1899), arguably
the first approximation of a modern anthropological monograph, which
was celebrated in its day as a realization of the possibilities of
fieldwork method and reached an international audience.28 Academics were also well placed
to secure financial support from government and private philanthropies,
as Haddon did when he organized the 1898 Cambridge Anthropological
Expedition to Torres Strait, a challenge to the viability of armchair
scholarship that constituted a move toward the professionalization
of anthropology, taking British academics to do field research; when
Haddon and his research team left Britain on 10 March 1898, the <italic>Times</italic> of London observed, “Travelling scholars are
often sent out by Oxford and Cambridge but this is probably the first
time that a real exploring expedition has been sent out by either
University.”29</p>

effectively for their purposes. See an 1838 letter from W. H. Fitton,

         <p>The reorganization of naturalists' work facilitated the reconceptualization
of evidence. When collectors worked in the field to satisfy the demands
of the armchair scholars who purchased their finds, they had considerable
incentive to identify new species: these had high market value. Indeed,
vendors of natural specimens had “a positive prejudice against
intermediate forms,” as Charles Lyell observed in 1867.30 Among professional naturalists,
however, the prestige attached to discovering new species declined,
and the appeal of intermediate forms grew.31 Such forms documented theoretical positions, the currency
of intellectual trade: field-going naturalists were prominent among
those biologists who embraced Darwinism, finding associations between
variations in life forms and geography and explaining their observations
as testimony to the operation of natural selection. Whatever the origin
of their scientific perspective, it was surely reinforced by their
experiences: traveling naturalists could not ignore concomitant variation
in land and life forms.32 Fieldworkers
also identified fewer species after they observed variability within
breeding populations (consistent with Darwinian argument).33 Finally, the biogeographical approach
compatible with taxonomic schemes that admitted of heterogeneity,
yielding classificatory lumping rather than splitting, suited fieldworkers
who were employed by museums—more important loci for the development
of professional careers in the late nineteenth century than they were
to be later—because museum displays could easily be (although
they were not necessarily) organized along geographical lines.34</p>
         <p>Consider the intellectual framework used by the fieldworking biologists-turned-anthropologists
Baldwin Spencer and A. C. Haddon, whose careers were linked.35 Both stumbled into anthropology—at
the historical moment when armchair scholars had grown suspicious
of the reports of casual travelers and called for rigorous inquiries.36 When Haddon did his zoological
work in the Torres Strait Islands, he pursued anthropology as a sideline,
both because he intended to supplement his research grant by collecting
artifacts to sell to museums and because he had agreed to answer questions
posed for him by J. G. Frazer, an archetypal armchair anthropologist,
as well as by the sociologist Edward Westermarck (of whom more shortly);
when he returned to the Torres Strait in 1898, he was gambling that
he could make a career in the still-nascent discipline of anthropology,
notwithstanding the caution issued by Thomas Huxley, his referee in
his many (largely unsuccessful) job applications, that employment
prospects were dim in his projected field—despite the abstract
merits of anthropological inquiry (which Huxley himself pursued).37 Similarly, Spencer was the zoologist
in the Horn Expedition when he made his first trip to Central Australia
in 1894; in the field he met Gillen, and the two formed an anthropological
partnership that lasted until Gillen's death in 1912. Most important,
Spencer and Haddon transferred the analytic perspective that informed
their zoological research to their anthropological work. It did not
matter whether they were analyzing giant earthworms (of special interest
for Spencer), sea anemones (Haddon's enthusiasm), or human societies.
They plotted variation along geographical axes, consistently understanding
variations in life forms in ecological terms and observing that geographical
isolation was an important factor in speciation. As a marine zoologist,
Haddon belonged to a population that had been obsessed with geographical
distribution since the second third of the nineteenth century, but
Spencer was no less committed to a biogeographical approach.38</p>
         <p>Field-going anthropologists did not have to begin their careers
as Darwinian biologists, as Spencer and Haddon did, in order to conceptualize
cultural variation biogeographically. When the young Franz Boas, trained
in physics and geography, went to Baffin Island, he had expectations
similar to Haddon's and Spencer's. Moreover, twenty-five
years after his first fieldwork, Boas would attribute the enduring “scientific
success of the Cambridge Torres Strait Expedition” to its conceptualization,
arguing that one should anticipate that a population's “isolation”
would be associated with its preservation of “an older type”
of culture. Unlike Haddon and Spencer, however, Boas did not understand
cultural variation as environmental adaptation. As his student Alexander
Lesser observed, Boas judged that geographical factors explained behavior
only “in trivial and shallow ways” and that people often
did things “in spite of” geographical conditions.39</p>
         <p>Fieldworkers in the diverse natural history sciences embraced similar
research designs and objectives. Many agreed that extrapolation to
general principles required sustained and close attention to specific
situations in circumscribed locations, where the possibilities of
variation were naturally bounded. When sociocultural anthropologists
turned away from surveys of human possibilities across all times and
places, their ideal research project became the “detailed study
of a single tribe or natural assemblage of people”—Haddon's
1890 description of his plan for the Cambridge expedition.40 In 1897, a method of close ecological
analysis of the life forms of strictly delimited geographical areas
was contrived in Nebraska by Frederick Clements and Roscoe Pound (Clements's
former student and then supervisor, who would apply biological reasoning
to legal issues and become dean of the Harvard Law School; his legal
theory arguably influenced sociocultural anthropology). British ecologists
shortly adopted methods similar to Americans', investigating
circumscribed natural communities. Early twentieth-century Austrian
climatologists cultivated particular local knowledge in order to recognize
the operation of general phenomena. In sum, the detailed study of
a limited area became a significant research approach in enterprises
as apparently unlike as anthropology and oceanography, although it
became overwhelmingly important in anthropology.41</p>
         <p>Readers of fieldworkers' accounts of transient phenomena in
remote places confronted the issue that had long troubled armchair
scholars: How were they to assess the accuracy of information they
could not inspect directly? In part, a narrative of the development
of a reliable scientific fieldworker could be extrapolated from the
long-established understanding of nature study as a moral exercise,
a means to spiritual growth. It was also important that, from the
end of the eighteenth century, high-minded (and prosperous) tourists
had sought enlightenment through travel: travelers expected to be
spiritually uplifted while contemplating the beauties of picturesque
scenery. This was an experience understood as equivalent to other
types of exalted aesthetic pleasures. For example, it made sense to
Thomas Huxley to say that he “felt as if [he were] listening
to beautiful music” while he was enjoying drawing the landscapes
he observed as assistant surgeon on the H.M.S. <italic>Rattlesnake</italic>, which cruised the Pacific between 1846 and 1850. Indeed, the process
of learning to draw from nature was believed to be transformative.
As Edwin Lees asserted in 1838, drawing “functioned as ‘a
moral engine that [led] to habits of accurate observation.’”42</p>
         <p>Enhanced regard for fieldwork as moral education also derived from
a new, Victorian-era mind-set: the view that personal growth (of an
implicitly masculine sort) was effected through pilgrimages to unfamiliar
places, where the European traveler would endure physical discomfort
and (genuine or imagined) danger. The characteristics of fieldwork
that had once made it dirty work now made it a purifying ordeal. Scientific
inquiry accomplished by daring exploits was exemplified by the Alpine
adventures of the polymath John Tyndall in the second third of the
nineteenth century. Because Tyndall could not gather the information
he wanted with the instruments he carried, he made his body into a
research tool, perilously edging his way over deep glacier crevasses
in order to prove that glaciers moved in their beds as solid objects.43 And for persons such as Tyndall,
the assumption that outdoor physical activity builds moral character
justified the expectation that the rigors of the field would inculcate
the personal discipline required to make scientists reliable.44 Consider what C. G. Seligman observed
in 1912 to Bronislaw Malinowski, then his protégé at
the London School of Economics and the person an international population
of sociocultural anthropologists still credit with setting their enterprise's
methodological standard: “field research in anthropology is
what the blood of martyrs is to the Church.”45 Heroic fieldwork was distinguished from the leisure-time
activities, ranging from museum visiting to field club participation,
that became widely available to the European and American middle classes
with the expansion of the railroads in the latter half of the nineteenth
century, as well as with the development of the bicycle and the automobile
at the end of the century. To late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
naturalists, then, “collecting close to home, however productive,
could seem tame, and too much like amateur collecting,” as Robert
Kohler has observed.46</p>
         <p>Nevertheless, the location of fieldworkers' research did not
by itself suffice to establish their reliability. An apparently promising
remote field site could be judged insufficiently wild to lend itself
to the production of good science. Consider the reception of the findings
of the self-taught American primatologist Richard Lynch Garner, who
went to French Equatorial Africa in 1892 to station himself in a protective
cage in the forest in order to listen to what he conceptualized as
primates' rudimentary language: upon his return home, he was
accused of contriving his results “in comfortable quarters at
a mission station.” But features of Garner's personal history—that
he both lacked academic credentials and courted (and achieved) popular
fame, performing in such venues as Madison Square Garden—surely
explain the criticism he received.47 The accuracy of the charge against Garner is less meaningful than
its form: the evidence he purveyed could not be believed because he
had not suffered in acquiring it. Naturalists who worked in sites
that were relatively easy of access gained credibility by stressing
that their knowledge was hard won. For example, the ornithologist
Edmund Selous demonstrated his seriousness of purpose (and presumably
his superiority to rank amateur birdwatchers) by emphasizing that
his observations of the mating habits of the ruff in Holland in 1906
necessarily mired him in “wretchedness, cold, and discomfort.”48 Significantly, scientists of this
era whose work never took them outdoors, such as the pioneers of radiology,
welcomed the afflictions that were the occupational hazards of their
day, understanding them as analogues to suffering in the field and,
as such, as testimonials to—and productive of—moral and
scientific virtues.49 Moreover,
the heroic fieldwork ideal has proven remarkably durable. Certainly,
field scientists have built formidable reputations with research conducted
in safe places, but evidence of having endured danger and discomfort
for the sake of one's work still testifies to authentic witnessing
for many species of fieldworkers and may be especially important for
those who—for whatever reason—aspire to public attention.50</p>
         <p>Because fieldwork was understood to test and build character, it
is not surprising that its practitioners were inclined (and permitted
by their audiences) to develop deliberately personal investigative
styles, as opposed to the ostensibly affectively neutral style normative
in laboratory research. Empathy became and remains an essential investigative
skill. Consider, for example, that in 1841 James David Forbes, professor
of natural philosophy at Edinburgh and an Alpine fieldworker, observed
that repudiation of conventional wisdom about glaciers required “a
protracted residence amongst the Icy Solitudes which imbues one truly
with their spirit [and] enables one to reason confidently concerning
things so widely rumored from common experience.” In 1893, the
professional anthropological attitude that is conventionally termed “rapport”
was prescribed in a disciplinary foundational moment, when A. C. Haddon
pronounced that it was essential to understand “native actions …
from a native and not from an European point of view.”51 Contemporary naturalists still
undertake inquiries with the objective of understanding their subjects
on their own terms. Indeed, the professional creed of ethologists
is to develop such a strong sense of emotional connection to their
observed animals that they feel they have <italic>become</italic> those
animals. A student of killer whales, for example, recently described “the
challenge of having to think like a killer whale … having to
strip your biases as a terrestrial, visually based mammal.”52 Sociocultural anthropologists are
distinctive, however. Unlike ethologists, whose objective of recording
natural behavior requires invisibility (or a close approximation thereof)
in the field, anthropologists' enduring commitment to the method
of participant observation—perpetuated even as their definition
of “the field” has been renegotiated—means that
they must “interact personally and socially with informants,”
as Harold Conklin remarked, and cannot maintain distinct private and
work lives while doing research.53</p>
         <p>Sociocultural anthropologists' affective relationships with
their informants have had various consequences. In colonial settings,
anthropologists who identified closely with the people they studied
were often thought to be subversives (in thought, if not necessarily
in deed): a far from exhaustive inventory of objects of official disapproval
includes Northcote W. Thomas in Nigeria and Sierra Leone before World
War I; Ralph Piddington, Olive Pink, and Ronald and Catherine Berndt
in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s; and Max Gluckman in Northern
Rhodesia in the years around World War II.54 But personal interactions between anthropologists and informants
have not been invariably (or consistently) pleasant—or even
tolerable—for any one or (conceivably) all of the parties to
them. Nor have unhappy relationships been confined to oppressive colonial
situations. For example, in 1960–1961, when Jeremy Boissevain
worked in a village in Malta, then poised to become a full member
of the British Commonwealth, villagers worried that he was “remarkably
well informed about matters they thought no nonvillager should know”
and were concerned “to determine for which country [he] was
spying.” The fictional Berkeley anthropologist in Mischa Berlinski's
recent novel <italic>Fieldwork</italic>, dismayed to find that she
did not <italic>like</italic> the people she chose to study, represents
one dimension of the sort of relationship Malinowski had with the
Trobriand Islanders, who enraged him intermittently.55 (See Figure 1 and Frontispiece.) Malinowski himself commented that what anthropologists
are able to learn is some function of the social roles that they are
inevitably assigned by their research subjects, urging the fledgling
fieldworker to anticipate “the [traditional customary] status
in which you will probably be placed”—which at that moment
in the history of anthropology also entailed his recommendation to
try to “associate yourself with [the] best category [of European]
for your purposes.”56 In
sum, though the specific observational positions of all types of scientific
fieldworkers surely affect their findings, anthropologists' interpersonal
relationships have been critical to their research—which is
to say that different sorts of relationships can elicit different
findings, not that conclusions should be dismissed as mere epiphenomena
of observers' perspectives.57</p>

               <p>There is still prestige attached to identifying a new species,
evidenced by the honor of naming it that routinely accrues to the

the “bonobos have contributed directly, through conversation,
to important aspects of this work. Their listing as authors is not
a literary technique but a recognition of their direct input to the

         <title>THE PECULIARITIES OF THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS</title>
         <p>If sociocultural anthropological method has much in common with
the field practices of other natural history sciences, it also has
distinctive characteristics, to which I now turn. What eventually
became the methodological standard for fieldworkers everywhere was
arguably defined by British anthropologists. Their premier theorist
was W. H. R. Rivers, who came to anthropology through his participation
in the 1898 Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Strait.
At that time, the medically trained Rivers was Cambridge University's
lecturer in experimental psychology and the physiology of the senses,
renowned for the rigor of his experiments; it was quite a coup for
the professionally insecure Haddon to enroll him in his expedition,
which was planned as a vehicle for elevating the scientific status
of anthropology, not least because its members would create a laboratory
in the field. Haddon repeatedly asserted that “investigations
in experimental psychology in the field were necessary if we were
ever to gauge the mental and sensory capabilities of primitive peoples”
and observed that Rivers had to be credited with “contribut[ing]
more than anyone else to … the raising of Ethnology to the
status of a science.”58</p>
         <p>The Torres Straits Expedition was team research, conducted by seven
men, each of whom undertook investigation of portions of the collective
project.59 But after the expedition's
work had ended, Rivers proclaimed that its organization and objectives
had been irreconcilable. The most influential of his prescriptive
statements was his contribution to the 1912 edition of <italic>Notes
and Queries on Anthropology</italic>, a book-length questionnaire
that was one iteration of a recurrent publication; originally addressed
to travelers, directing them to acquire information armchair scholars
wanted, it became in the 1912 edition a guide for fieldworkers, Malinowski
among them. Rivers allowed that the Torres Straits Expedition had
visited the right sort of field site: anthropologists <italic>should</italic> study a “community of perhaps four or five hundred people”
that was “more or less sharply marked off from surrounding peoples,”
such as “the inhabitants of an island or distinct geographical
district,” but he argued that, for the sake of scientific rigor,
anthropologists must abandon team research and become solitary participant
observers.60 Why was this shift
not seen as retrograde, since a team could engage in the acts of dispute
and corroboration that have conventionally been seen as the foundation
of scientific method?</p>
         <p>Rivers insisted that the deployment of a survey team bent on rapid
results was counterproductive. Describing what is now known as the “anthropologist
effect,” he stated that “the temporary visit of a set
of strangers among a people of rude culture” induced “such
a condition of excitement” as to disrupt the normal behavior
anthropologists wished to observe. (Note that Rivers was transferring
to the field a perennial methodological concern of laboratory psychologists;
he also worried about experimentalists' influence on their subjects.)
Indeed, the expectation that a survey team could work efficiently
was unrealizable: because all elements in primitive societies were
linked, members of teams would find themselves working at cross-purposes
when they attempted to divide research into discrete tasks. Anthropologists
must abandon teamwork along with research projects of the “extensive”
variety. A lone generalist should do “intensive” research,
living “for a year or more” among a people, mastering
the vernacular and developing a personal relationship with each member
of the population.61 And probably
not least because it was readily appreciated as heroic experience,
the intensive study accomplished through solitary fieldwork—often
operationalized as research by a married couple—became the ideal,
notwithstanding some notable departures from it, including Rivers's
own.62</p>
         <p>Why were the observations of a lone anthropologist more scientific
than those of a research team? Rivers argued that the anthropologist's
body served as a reliable measuring instrument. I stress that Rivers's
conceptualization of the anthropologist's body was identical
to his model of the Torres Strait Islander's body, some characteristics
of which were identified through a feature of the expedition's
work that Rivers judged positively: the psychological tests administered
by members of the research team, under his own supervision.63 These demonstrated that the islanders'
senses of hearing, touch, smell, and vision differed little from those
of European experimental subjects. Absent test results, the researchers
might have imagined that islanders were the savages of legend, acutely
responsive to all manner of sensory stimuli and by this token closer
to a lower animal state than Europeans—humankind in embryonic
form, as it were. But testing proved that islanders' remarkable
observational powers were learned, not innate—the products of
long-established habits of close attention to those features of their
habitat that figured in their mode of subsistence. Islanders'
habits fit the pattern characteristic of primitive peoples, made up
of the adaptive responses required to survive in unimproved nature.
Indeed, those islanders who had relatively high exposure to the civilization
brought by colonialism—young people, as well as those who lived
on the Torres Strait islands that were relatively close to Australia—had
nearly modern body economies, with relatively limited powers of utilitarian
sensory attention. Significantly, traditional islanders did “not
take the same aesthetic interest in nature which is found among civilized
peoples”—critical evidence of their impoverished intellectual
development and generally low cultural condition. They were endowed
with the <italic>capacity</italic> for higher mental functions, but
because they had to expend so much of their energy “on the sensory
foundations” of sheer survival, it was “natural that the
intellectual superstructure should suffer.” When comparable
research was subsequently done in Egypt and India, Rivers's judgment
was reinforced: “The general conclusion which may be drawn from
the available evidence is that pure sense-acuity is much the same
in all races in the absence of definite pathological conditions.”
Note that Franz Boas wrote in 1911, “Primitive man …
is not in the habit of discussing abstract ideas. His interests center
around the occupations of his daily life.”64 And the judgment that biological and cultural
differences were not covariant called for a separation of the investigative
tasks of the physical and the sociocultural anthropologist—even
if, as in Boas's case, one person might undertake both types
of research.</p>
         <p>Exercises in anthropological psychology substantiated the physiological
model that informed Rivers's and Haddon's other scientific
work. Torres Strait Islanders exhibited qualities induced in European
experimental subjects whose judgmental and sensory abilities were
deliberately reduced through either surgery or drugs, making them
rather more physical than rational beings—subjects who included
Rivers himself, as well as his collaborator and friend Henry Head.65 Ultimately, while serving as a
military psychiatrist during World War I, Rivers would interpret as
degeneration on a behavioral evolutionary scale the functional psychological
disorder that was named “shell shock” by his former student
and associate in the Torres Straits Expedition Charles Myers, who
served as consulting psychologist to the British Army in France: shell
shock sufferers, traumatized by the struggle to survive on the battlefield—the
most perilous of environments—presented various characteristics
similar to traits of primitive peoples. Their condition demonstrated
a general principle: “in morbid states early instinctive modes
of reaction tend to reappear.” Most important, Rivers stressed
that, given sufficiently stressful circumstances, anyone could succumb
to shell shock, regardless of either his hereditary endowments or
his accumulated experiences.66</p>
         <p>In sum, various forms of evidence, produced both fortuitously and
experimentally, indicated that the anthropologist who immersed himself
in an exotic culture could serve as a reliable research instrument.
In the <italic>Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition
to Torres Straits</italic>, Rivers provided anecdotal evidence consistent
with the investigative approach he later formulated: the experience
of K. E. Ranke, a German specialist in tropical medicine who was also
an anthropologist and an active participant in the German exploration
of South America. Ranke had recently returned from a sojourn among
Brazilian indigenes, during which he imitated their behavior and found
himself a changed person. Becoming, of necessity, consumed by attention
to the minute particulars of his natural surroundings, he “lost
his capacity for the aesthetic enjoyment of scenery” and for
contemplation of “the more serious problems of life”;
nevertheless, he retained his ability to understand his transformation.67 But though Ranke may have been
the prototype for Rivers's ideal-typical anthropological fieldworker,
his fortuitous mode of inquiry fit a pattern long familiar in physiological-psychological
circles in Europe and America—that of the sympathetic observer,
who could reproduce in himself the emotions of the person he wished
to understand by imitating that person's postures, gestures,
and facial expressions.68 Although
Rivers assessed Torres Strait Islanders' capacities using some
of the new methods that were transforming psycho-physiological inquiry
in the late nineteenth century, his recommendation for future anthropological
work sustained the older investigative style: if the anthropologist
conducted himself as his subjects did, he would become an embodied
instrument, literally thinking and feeling as they did.</p>
         <p>What reasoning justified Rivers's method? Rivers began as
a Spencerian and ended as a Freudian, but his intellectual changes
were not disjunctive. In his obituary of Rivers, Head observed that
Rivers considered all of his varied interests to be “aspects
of the same problem, the biological reaction of man to his environment.”69 That is, evolutionary change (which
included degeneration) was central to all of Rivers's—and
Haddon's—research; anthropology could address in the field
questions about human evolution that could not be investigated in
laboratories. The underlying rationale of Rivers's—and
Haddon's—research method was provided by the physiology
of Michael Foster, who taught Haddon and was a mentor to Rivers. Defined
as a science of evolutionary adaptation and requiring attention to
ecological variation, Foster's physiology was compatible with
the broadly influential arguments of Herbert Spencer, and it accounted
for “the actions of living beings on their surroundings (the
study of these necessarily involving the correlative study of the
effect of the surroundings on the living being).” Its explanation
of adaptation depended on a physico-chemical model widely accepted
during the nineteenth century: the individual was conceptualized as
an energy system, in which forces were variously transferred and transformed
into—as Foster put it—“movement, feeling, and thought.”
At the heart of Foster's research program was embryology—arguably
the most important area of laboratory science inspired by Darwin's
scheme. Embryology identified lines of evolutionary filiation and
interpreted the development of any given organism in energetic terms:
if, as Haddon explained, an embryo grew in a challenging environment,
it had to expend a considerable portion of its energy reserve, and
its developmental potential would be limited. The Freudian model of
the person that Rivers endorsed late in his life (with the qualification
that Freud exaggerated the motivational importance of both humans'
innate sex drive and feelings grounded in their early childhood experiences)
also fit Rivers's established explanatory habits: the individual
body housed a set of competing forces, the expression of which depended
on environmental factors—and the health of the individual represented
the positive direction of impulses.70 In sum, Rivers was just one among the many nineteenth-century
scientists who were engaged in the effort to translate the law of
the conservation of energy into observations of every feature of the
natural world—physical, chemical, biological, geological, and
so on.71</p>
         <p>Theirs was the framework that explains Malinowski's understanding
of himself as he ventured into the field, a journey he was bound to
take at the insistence not only of his mentor and, later, colleague
at the London School of Economics, C. G. Seligman, a participant in
the Torres Straits Expedition, but also of another person who was
critically important to his education, Edward Westermarck, whom Malinowski
credited with inspiring him to pursue anthropological training at
the LSE and who made the first of his many field trips to Morocco
in 1898. It was Seligman who acted to secure financing for Malinowski's
fieldwork, however, enlisting Rivers and Haddon to testify to the
young man's professional promise.72 In the field, Malinowski consulted Rivers's writings,
corresponded with him, and translated his precepts into action: he
mastered local languages, dispensing with interpreters' services;
obeyed Rivers's injunctions to be as unobtrusive a presence as
possible; and interacted with indigenes as individuals, recognizing
considerable variation among them. In 1916, he wrote to Haddon that
Rivers was his “patron saint in fieldwork,” and he stated
in his landmark study, <italic>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</italic> (1922), that scientific anthropological method had “been developed
to its fullest extent in the works of Dr. Rivers.”73 Indeed, his understanding of himself
fit the Riversian model; as one biographical account observes, Malinowski's “method
consisted in using one's whole personal life as a scientific
instrument,” an approach denoted by his observation in <italic>Argonauts</italic> that it was necessary to attend to “the
personal equation of the observer”—the well-known psychological
dictum that reception of sense data varied to some degree from one
individual to another.74 Notwithstanding
his formidable language skills, Malinowski rejected the late nineteenth-century
anthropological judgment that learning a language would reveal its
speakers' mind-set (though he insisted that mastery of a people's
language was vital to good research). Rather, he argued, the anthropologist
came to understand his subjects by embracing their way of life: “I
had to learn to behave like the native in personal and social intercourse.
Through this, I learned how they think [and] daydream.”75</p>
         <p>Consider Malinowski's psycho-physical understanding of himself
during his initial fieldwork. In his diary, he interpreted his feelings
as functions of his body's economy, in Riversian terms. While
traveling by ship, he wrote, “Loss of subjectivism and deprivation
of the will … living only by the five senses and the body (through
impressions) causes direct merging with surroundings.” In the
field, he frequently chastised himself for lapses from his ideal moral
standard, which he understood as descents into sensuality. When he
had no “energy to get to work,” his moral tone fell and
he succumbed to “lecherous thoughts,” with the result
that his “metaphysical conception of the world [was] completely
dimmed.” And he complained that, in his weakened condition, “I
am unable to control things or to be creative in relation to the world.”76 Malinowski has been criticized
for misrepresenting his fieldwork, both exaggerating its duration
and inadequately acknowledging the assistance he received from other
Europeans in his areas of operation. But it is evident that he took
Rivers's injunctions very seriously; his practices were consistent
with his life-long habits of self-examination, self-discipline, and
self-reproach (surely reinforced by the necessity of attention to
the problematic health he suffered throughout his relatively short
life), as well as with his strong commitment to what he understood
as scientific method, grounded in his early studies of science and
philosophy.77 Moreover, during
the period when he was articulating the basic tenets of his approach,
Malinowski understood individual motivation and behavior in near-Freudian
terms, as Rivers had: “the beginning of culture implie[d] the
repression of instincts,” and human “emotional life [was]
definitely coordinated with the environment.”78 As Rivers had done with rather different emphases,
Malinowski argued that biological needs were the bases of social institutions
and that human action also led to developments irreducible to biology.
But the biological feature of his theory was widely rejected after
his death. The antibiological turn may to some extent have been a
function of sociocultural anthropology's changing recruitment
base. But the most important factor in the decline of Malinowski's
reputation as a theorist was surely the increased professional power
of Rivers's first anthropology student, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown,
who was militantly antireductionist, though no less scientistic than
Malinowski.79</p>
         <p>George Stocking memorably termed Malinowski the “mythic culture
hero of anthropological method.” Indeed, it would be difficult
to overestimate the international renown that Malinowski gained in
this capacity. In his 1960 Inaugural Lecture of the Chair of Social
Anthropology at the Collège de France, for example, Claude
Lévi-Strauss observed that Malinowski “institu[ted] the
ethnographer's uncompromising participation in the life and thought
of the natives”—a judgment that can be seen as especially
notable, because Lévi-Strauss might have cited a homegrown
figure with an illustrious intellectual pedigree, Arnold van Gennep,
a chronically underemployed student of Émile Durkheim's
nephew and disciple Marcel Mauss who joined field observation and
generalization at the same time as Malinowski did, in the World War
I era.80 When anthropologists
assessed Malinowski's work upon the occasion of his death, many
of them were extremely critical, not least because the relationships
they had with him in life were problematic in both personal and professional
terms. But they disaggregated his method from his functionalist theoretical
orientation, focusing on the defects of the latter; recent anthropologists
have sustained their predecessors' judgment, seeing his method
as fundamental to the working definition of their enterprise.81</p>

               <p>At Cracow's Jagiellonian University, Malinowski initially
studied physics and mathematics, but he wrote a Ph.D. thesis in philosophy,
supervised by a historian of philosophy. See Andrzej K. Paluch, “The

wife, Elsie, who succumbed to multiple sclerosis in 1935, at forty-five.
Seligman's relationship with Malinowski was evidently sustained

also pp. 157–172. Malinowski's differences with Freud were
both with Freud's identification of basic drives (he thought
Freud exaggerated the importance of sexual impulses and ignored other
instincts) and with the Lamarckian evolutionism that underpinned Freud's
arguments, making, say, development of an Oedipus complex a universal
feature of human males' maturation, built into their developmental
program through a specific historical experience at the dawn of the
species' existence (an argument substantiated with reference
to anthropological texts of the nineteenth-century armchair variety,
grounded in a unilinear evolutionary model, which Malinowski's
variant of anthropology was designed to discredit). Note that Malinowski
agitated to get a Nobel Prize for Freud (for academic and political
reasons, it was to be a peace prize); see Malinowski to Seligman,
4 Oct. 1938, MP 27/7. For an account that both chronicles Malinowski's

irreducible to psychological or biological factors, but his student
Radcliffe-Brown made irreducibility a defining property of sociocultural

understanding of humankind's “manifold diversity”;

               <p>In general, twentieth-century sociocultural anthropologists turned
against previous efforts to plot a unilinear course of evolutionary
development that obtained in societies everywhere, at all times. Malinowski's
functionalist approach prevailed in Britain and appealed elsewhere;
its object was not historical reconstruction but analysis of the ways
that any given society's component parts interacted, making the
whole what Meyer Fortes memorably termed a “going concern.”
See Kuklick, <italic>Savage Within</italic> (cit. n. 54), pp. 72–73,
120–121, and <italic>passim</italic>. For analysis of the differences
between British and American approaches see Stocking, “Basic
Assumptions of Boasian Anthropology” (cit. n. 74). Malinowski's
problematic personal relationships with some of his students ranged
from the intermittently difficult (as with Meyer Fortes) to the consistently
antagonistic (as with E. E. Evans-Pritchard). It is of some interest
that Evans-Pritchard's differences with Malinowski were purely
personal; as Malcolm Crick wrote to Phyllis Kaberry, in Evans-Pritchard's
last Oxford lecture he said that though “he hated Malinowski
and liked Radcliffe-Brown, Malinowski did a great deal to advance
anthropology, whereas Radcliffe-Brown did nothing”: Crick to
Kaberry, 24 Nov. 1972, Richards Papers, London School of Economics
and Political Science, File 17/1. Malinowski's relations with
his early mentors worsened over time. Consider their reluctance to
endorse his election to the Royal Society. On 21 Nov. 1933 Arthur
Keith, an eminent physical anthropologist who judged Malinowski “the
keenest brain in anthropology,” urged Seligman to propose Malinowski's
election, but Seligman refused: Keith to Malinowski, 25 July 1928,
Malinowski Papers, Yale University Archives, New Haven, Connecticut,
MS 19, Box 4. On 27 Nov. 1933 Haddon told Seligman that he was not
prepared to move Malinowski's election himself but would second
a motion, saying, “As I have said before, I do not trust Malinowski”:
Haddon to Seligman, 27 Nov. 1933, MP 27/6. The election became moot.
See also Seligman to Haddon, 25 Nov. 1933, MP 27/6. Seligman bore
some responsibility for their troubled relationship, however, quarreling
with Malinowski over the LSE curriculum and reproaching him for his
failures as an academic citizen. Perhaps his most outrageous act was
collaborating with Joseph Oldham, director of the International Institute
of African Languages and Cultures, in censoring an article of Malinowski's
prior to its 1929 publication in the institute journal, <italic>Africa</italic>; he claimed that they acted to make the article “as little
harmful as possible” to the reputation of the discipline of
anthropology: Seligman to Malinowski, 5 Aug. 1931, MP 27/4. For posthumous
criticisms of Malinowski see, e.g., Radcliffe-Brown, “Note on
Functional Anthropology” (cit. n. 79); and Clyde Kluckhohn, “Bronislaw
Malinowski, 1884–1942,” <italic>Journal of American Folklore</italic>, 1943, <italic>56</italic>:2008–2019, which granted the quality
of Malinowski's fieldwork but argued that he had been credited
with innovations made by Boasians, who lacked his devotion to self-promotion.

         <p>Rivers's methodological contribution was of vital importance
to a discipline that was institutionally insecure and of relatively
low status at the turn of the twentieth century.82 To substantiate my claim that his prescription
for fieldwork had a major impact, I could detail his professional
lineage. But a summary of occupational kinship suffices: virtually
all members of the first professional generation of British sociocultural
anthropologists were somehow the intellectual progeny of the Torres
Straits Expedition. In particular, Radcliffe-Brown became an international
agent for the dissemination of his teacher's scientific ideal;
between 1921 and 1937, he was employed in turn at Cape Town, Sydney,
and Chicago before becoming the foundation professor of social anthropology
at Oxford. Although Radcliffe-Brown and Rivers had notable differences,
the student credited his mentor with working out “the scientific
methods of ethnographical observation”—and, significantly,
was known throughout his career as Rivers's student.83 As should already be clear, Malinowski
represented himself as Rivers's methodological disciple (indeed,
Malinowski did not dare to criticize any aspect of Rivers's work
in public until nearly a decade after Rivers's death—by
which time he must have judged that the great man's reputation
had dimmed sufficiently that a limited critique would not be impolitic).84 Radcliffe-Brown also acknowledged
Malinowski's methodological refinements, although relations between
the two men were strained by intermittent personal antagonism, theoretical
disputes, and contests for dominance of academic turf.85</p>
         <p>Most important, Malinowski had an international reputation and
a truly international pedagogic reach. Students from all over Europe,
North America, and the British Commonwealth came to work with him
at the London School of Economics, and they spread his message as
they found employment around the world. The Rockefeller Foundation
was largely responsible for bringing an international population to
study with him, supporting students either directly through its own
fellowship program or through the International Institute of African
Languages and Cultures, a venture that incorporated British, French,
German, and Belgian parties, although it was headquartered in Britain.
Malinowski's global influence followed from foundation policy:
one component of the fellowship selection process was an assessment
of the probability that candidates would have academic employment
at home upon completion of their training, which would make them sound
investments.86 The Rockefeller
Foundation was not the only source of funding for sociocultural anthropology
in the interwar period, but it was certainly the most generous source,
and its patronage had an enormous impact.</p>
         <p>In explaining the appeal of Rivers's energetic model of the
body, extradisciplinary factors are just as important as (or components
of) professional ones: his was just one expression of a scheme that
was in widespread circulation. That is, Rivers and his exemplar, Ranke,
were hardly the only naturalists to explain the differences between
primitive and civilized lifestyles in energetic terms, and, indeed,
their argument had a considerable lineage.87 A report similar to Ranke's is found, for example,
in W. H. Hudson's immensely popular <italic>Idle Days in Patagonia</italic>, first published in 1893 and subsequently reprinted many times in
a number of languages. An Argentine-born British naturalist who belonged
to a scientific network that included Alfred Russel Wallace, Hudson
described himself as regressing to a savage sensibility while following
the indigenes' lifestyle in Argentina.</p>
         <p>Consider some other uses to which the energetic model of the body
was put. Karl Marx read and cited W. R. Grove's <italic>On the
Correlation of Physical Forces</italic> (1867), one of the major sources
of the model's popularization (and one that advanced a moderately
distinctive version of it); Marx used it to support his definition
of human labor power, arguing that since the portion of human energy
devoted to material production declined as the economic system's
productive capacity increased, historical change was leading to more
time for “the free intellectual and social activity of the individual.”
A congeries of European and North American practitioners of what Robert
Brain calls “physiological aesthetics” sought to develop
an energetic science of art appreciation, which explained, for example,
that engagement with a work of art meant reproducing the psychological
state that shaped the creator's production of it. One expression
of this project, the scheme of the British art critic Vernon Lee (born
Violet Paget), was predicated on the assumption that the intensity
of a human body's physical response to an art object or landscape
was directly proportional to the aesthetic quality of the object or
scene—provided that the witness's body had not been corrupted
by base sensuality, which rendered it incapable of an authentic physical
response to beauty.88 During
the nineteenth century, athleticism became a cult that extended to
the valorization of scientific work performed outdoors: exercise was “an
incomparable psychic instrument,” in the words of the French
Baron Pierre de Coubertin (whose efforts were critical to the revival
of the Olympic Games in 1896), understood as a means to discipline
the body's animating forces so as to preclude the possibility
of degeneration. And the American secondary school biology curriculum
that was developed in the early twentieth century relied on “laboratory
exercises through which students learned the fundamental similarity
of energy transformation in steam engines, plants, and boys,”
which taught them to understand evolution as “successful adaptation
to changing environments,” as Philip Pauly observed.89</p>
         <p>Or consider the immensely influential <italic>Principles of Scientific
Management</italic>, published by Frederick Winslow Taylor in 1911
but specifying human engineering practices that he had been recommending
and implementing since the 1890s. Taylor's book attracted international
attention and inspired changes in management practices in many settings
(although, as is well known, the gap between its recommendations and
their realization was considerable). It is often interpreted as a
brief for unrestrained managerial authority, justifying control of
every feature of workers' occupational performance—and
it is that. But our understanding of scientific management changes
somewhat if we shift our focus from the omniscient manager to the
worker as the manager is supposed to conceptualize him: as the repository
of a limited portion of energy, which will be expended efficiently
if the manager thoroughly controls its distribution.</p>
         <p>As widely diffused a scheme as the energetic model cannot possibly
have meant the same thing to all of its exponents. Both Taylor and
Rivers, say, were confident that their procedures were rigorously
scientific, but they had very different views of humanity. Their energetic
understanding allowed Rivers and his associates to preserve notions
of cultural hierarchy without explaining this hierarchy in racist
terms, rejecting the hypothesis that non-Western peoples behaved as
they did because they were less evolved members of the human species
than Europeans.90 Riversians
could assume that Torres Strait Islanders, removed to the material
comfort of a Western society and free to turn their attention to the
higher things of life, could follow civilized ways, just as Europeans
who found themselves consumed by the exigencies of survival in the
field might find abstract thought difficult. Quite unlike Rivers's
Torres Strait Islander, Taylor's model worker, the long-suffering
Schmidt, seems inherently incapable of higher thought, motivated to
follow managerial directives he (putatively) finds counterintuitive
in order to gain the increased pay that will enable him to realize
his modest hopes for his family.</p>
         <p>Rivers's definition of the method of participant observation
and his recommendations for field-site selection were not his only
contributions to the transformation of sociocultural anthropology.
On the Torres Straits Expedition he devised a specific technique,
his “genealogical method,” that enabled fieldworkers to
identify social structures on the basis of a people's distinctive
understandings of kinship ties and proved of durable research value.
Mastery of this method, he asserted, enabled experts to understand
social relationships so complex that “Europeans who have spent
their whole lives among the people have never been able to grasp them.”
This was a strategic argument: fieldwork of a year or more in an exotic
place might have been impressive by comparison with a passing traveler's
visit, but anthropologists' research trips were brief by contrast
to the sustained experiences on which colonial officials based their
claims to superior knowledge.91 Indeed, two early anthropological monographs—Baldwin Spencer
and F. J. Gillen's 1899 <italic>Native Tribes of Central Australia</italic> and Charles Hose and William McDougall's 1912 <italic>The Pagan
Tribes of Borneo</italic>, each the result of collaboration between
an academic and a veteran colonial civil servant—can be seen
as products of suspicion that colonial administrators' pretensions
might be justifiable.</p>
         <p>Arguably, however, the strongest claim that sociocultural anthropologists
could make to superior observational powers was grounded in their
commitment to embrace alien lifestyles wholeheartedly—the indispensable
quality of professional character that has been preserved in disciplinary
lore—and this claim made sense in both Malinowskian and Riversian
terms if anthropologists' bodies were reliable measuring devices.
Sociocultural anthropologists trained in the interwar period could <italic>sound</italic> very Riversian, arguing, for example, “If one
must act as though one believed, one ends in believing as one acts.”
And anthropologists have remained certain that their research method
works—that “they learn to see things (or hear them, or
touch them) in the ways their teachers and companions do” by
participating in the lives of others, so that the fieldworker “becomes
the other through experience”—but in the post-Malinowskian
era it seemed that personal transformation “can't be done
by any kind of scientific technique.”92 That is, students are still taught in graduate school that
the fieldworker is an “instrument” and that “the
ideal anthropological personality” is the adaptable and perceptive
adventurer who is happiest in the field.93 But they have not sustained the energetic rationale for
participant observation—or even remembered it so that they might
evaluate it.</p>
         <p>Surely at least one (if not the major) reason for the failure to
preserve the rationale for the method along with its ostensive replication
over professional generations has been that opportunities for formal
preparation for fieldwork have been virtually nonexistent until relatively
recently, notwithstanding a few conspicuous—and conspicuously
successful—exceptions.94 This is especially curious because, contrary to disciplinary myth,
pioneers of fieldwork method taught courses in it. Indeed, Malinowski
drafted a guide to field method at some point during the interwar
period, and his students received considerable preparation for research—as
well as concrete, practical advice in his responses to their letters
from the field, tailored to their distinctive situations and objectives.
It is of some interest that Malinowski's guide disparaged the
preference for thoroughly exotic research sites, referring disdainfully
to researchers determined to “study people who have rarely seen
a white,” an objective that he thought likely betrayed “a
wish to be spectacular rather than scientific.”95</p>
         <p>How was the myth of Malinowski's own fieldwork embedded in
professional memory? Malinowski's own oracular utterances were
surely important. In his lectures, he bolstered his heroic image by
issuing a standard narrative of the course of field research: the
shock of arrival all alone in a remote village; the loneliness of
living without the companionship of other Europeans; and the depression
(often described as a breakdown) that the anthropologist was bound
to suffer at some point.96 Nonetheless,
in what came to be anthropologists' received history of Malinowski's
professional development, the decisive factor in the creation of proper
fieldwork method was a historical accident: as a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Malinowski was identified as an enemy alien and trapped in
Australia and its environs for the duration of World War I because
he happened to be there (to attend a meeting of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science) when war broke out; he found himself
with no option other than to pursue funding that allowed him to live
in the field for an unprecedented period, and—so the story goes—he
recognized the merits of his experience in retrospect. In fact, he
had intended to spend two years in the field and, thanks largely to
Seligman, had the wherewithal to do so; he was able to secure additional
funds from the Australian government by promising to identify information
useful to Australia's colonial administrators.97 But no matter how this false memory was implanted,
a peculiar course of disciplinary apprenticeship was sanctioned by
the belief that methodological innovation was a matter of chance rather
than reason. Some mentors in other field sciences have insisted that
their students work out for themselves how to do research, but generations
of sociocultural anthropologists elevated this pedagogic style to
a professional creed.98</p>
         <p>There is abundant documentation of subscription to this creed.
For example, in 1925, in an early French fieldwork manual, Alfred
Metraux observed that there could be no rules “beyond certain
principles of prudence and impartiality, [for] the freedom of the
researcher must be complete.” In the 1940s, Alfred Kroeber,
Boas's first Ph.D. student, dismissed the very possibility that
field method could be formally taught: “Some can, and some can't.”
Half a century later, Clifford Geertz remarked that research method
is “something one picks up as one goes along.”99 Generations of desperate graduate
students turned for guidance to Malinowski's introduction to <italic>Argonauts</italic> or even consulted his archived fieldnotes if they
could.100 In the 1980s, Chris
Shore's mentors understood first fieldwork as an initiation rite:
it was “‘character building’; the tough crucible
in which good ethnographers were forged”—“you either
had the knack and could cope, or you did not.” Shore's
only preparation came from transmission of the cautionary injunctions
of the disciplinary giant E. E. Evans-Pritchard, which included “Bring
a stool with you” and “Don't get food on your fieldnotes.”
Even today, fieldwork instruction may be limited to cryptic aphorisms
and anecdotes featuring famous anthropologists. Students learn that
Evans-Pritchard also said, “For God's sake, don't
sleep with the natives,” but they comment that their mentors
have been “notoriously private when it came to talking about
their [own] field experience[s].”101</p>
         <p>Compatible with—although not necessarily linked to—pedagogic
negligence has been the sustained tradition that to design research
prior to one's arrival in the field is a waste of time. In 1932,
Malinowski urged his student Lucy Mair to “do bits of work here
and there, which apparently seem irrelevant to any scheme”—though
he assured her that the bits would eventually “begin to shape
and fall into pattern,” at which point “method comes in.”
Later anthropologists made similar pronouncements. In 1977, Margaret
Mead exhorted the fieldworker to “be continually prepared for
anything, everything—and perhaps most devastating—for
nothing.” A recent assessment of fieldwork practices endorsed
the “traditional aim” of “seeking serendipity, or
at least the unpredictable.” Even a proclamation of intent to
create innovative field method echoes the time-honored theme: “Openness
to what one encounters ‘in the field’ (however ‘the
field’ is defined) is part of what makes ethnography a distinctive
approach.”102 Contemporary
prescriptions may suggest that the working anthropologist's body
must remain in a state of alertness, always ready to register unanticipated
stimuli that might provoke insight, but such injunctions do not preserve
the energetic rationale for fieldwork.</p>

               <p>In this regard, Rivers was more progressive than Haddon in 1898.
Haddon granted that the various characteristics of human types were
independently assorted, each type having some apparently primitive
and some apparently advanced traits, but he argued that “there
can be no doubt that, on the whole, the white race has progressed
beyond the black race”: A. C. Haddon, <italic>Study of Man</italic> (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1898), p. xxii. But by 1935,
when the first volume of <italic>Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological

since 1989. Many departments currently require students to do some
sort of fieldwork early in their graduate careers. The American Anthropological
Association now publicizes special short-term field method courses
for sociocultural anthropologists, at least one of which has been
in recurrent operation since 1994; see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

the LSE, and Michigan, offer practical courses. But students can complete
Ph.D.'s in sociocultural anthropology in high-ranked departments
without taking methods courses, and it is still respectable to proclaim
to a professional audience that field method cannot be taught; the
full gamut of opinion on the teachability of field method was represented

         <title>MEMORY LOST AND FOUND</title>
         <p>Considering the family of natural history sciences that were transformed
at the end of the nineteenth century, we can see that many of the
characteristics then introduced have persisted and that the various
enterprises still have much in common. The heroic ideal has endured.
Moreover, when sociocultural anthropologists ventured into the field,
they sustained a perceptual change resembling that experienced by
other types of naturalists: they observed that the species they studied
admitted of considerable apparent variation and that the success of
adaptive behavior could be judged only with reference to circumstances.
It is not surprising that the anthropological project of determining
where given societies stood in a natural hierarchy (for many nineteenth-century
figures, on a unilinear developmental scale) was displaced by efforts
to document the sheer abundance of realized human behavioral possibilities—whether
these efforts were undertaken to reveal diversity <italic>per se</italic> or justified as quests for some underlying regularities animating
all forms of social organization.103 Historical trends in anthropologists' explanations of human
variation and the emergence of relativistic perspectives have not
been considered as some functions of the field-going naturalist's
experience, but they evidently can and should be.</p>
         <p>But what are we to make of the vicissitudes of the energetic explanation
of both cultural differences and fieldworkers' capacity to understand
different ways of life? For Rivers himself, the energetic model had
various implications: he treated shell shock compassionately, in nearly
Freudian fashion—a style different from the punitive approaches
favored by many military psychiatrists who served with him in World
War I; and he saw diverse ways of life as appropriate, adaptive responses,
asserting that humans everywhere had equivalent natural potential.
But for the population of sociocultural anthropologists in the aggregate,
belief in the energetic model of the body was not required to understand
fieldwork as the means for reaching sympathetic interpretations of
exotic peoples' ways of life. The energetic model was consistent
with both Rivers's and Malinowski's views, since each appealed
to biological processes in explaining human variations (albeit with
qualifications specific to each). But once they had defined ideal
field method, others could take it up and explain its positive results
in different ways. And the argument that individuals' moral careers
must be understood as a series of ascents or descents on a behavioral
evolutionary scale that are some function of circumstantial demands
on bodies' energy reserves—that any given individual is
potentially capable of the full range of human behavioral modes—constituted
a quasi-relativism that gave way to a commitment to find value in
virtually every way of life (if not necessarily the same measure of
value).104 There is an apparent
paradox here: the development of a relativistic perspective was closely
associated with attention to the possibilities of degeneration. Notably,
while Malinowski's early efforts referred to “lower races”
in the aggregate, he came to abhor discussions of “progress,”
and his own experience of personal change in the field involved what
he would have seen as degeneration; Rivers was obsessed with degeneration—in
experimental subjects (including himself), soldiers on the battlefield,
and entire populations.105 A
relativistic view was born not so much from seeing so-called savages
as noble as from seeing that even the most civilized of humans were
inherently capable of degenerating to a primitive condition.</p>
         <p>The value of cultural relativism has been represented as self-evident:
there is no need to justify a morally unexceptionable position. And
the energetic explanation of cultural variation represented a transitional
moment in disciplinary transformation. Once the case was made that
fieldworkers could develop empathy, it was no longer necessary to
explain how it happened: evidence of successful negotiation of the
heroic ordeal that effected researchers' personal transformation
substituted for an explanation of it. For us, however, comprehending
the scientific mind-set that informed Rivers's and Malinowski's
understanding of the possibilities of research method is itself as
much an anthropological exercise as a historical one—identification
of a way of thinking different from our own—and is, as such,
a contribution to the anthropological project as it has been defined
for over a century. Finally, there is a satisfying irony in my narrative:
while colonial expansion facilitated field scientists' professionalization,
for social anthropologists, in particular, a rationale for fieldwork
practice adapted from widespread scientific discourse conduced to
the development of relativistic arguments that were far from apologies
for colonialism.</p>
