<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barbara D. DiBernard Alchemy and 'Finnegans Wake' Albany: Suny Press 1980 163pp $24.95 ISBN 0-87395-388-6 HIS BOOK is a somewhat disappointing performance. From the blurb, and more so from the chapter headings: 'The Excre- mental Vision', 'Spiritual and Physical Alchemy', 'As above, so below', 'Death and Rebirth', 'Number Symbolism', 'Colors', 'Forgery', and so forth, we anticipate not only an in-depth analysis of specific (al)chemical allusions in the Wake, but a critique and even a new theory of Joyce's view of the artist and of the artistic process. When we descend below the hype and the subtitles to the text itself, alas, the promised gold remains untransmuted base matter - one more 'Finnegans Wake is' about X' thesis with the distortion and exaggeration endemic to that apparently inexhaustible genre. Of the alchemical metaphor and its relevance to the Wake two questions may be asked. One, is it possible or useful to posit a correspondence between the pseudoscience and the novel? And two, if so, did Joyce consciously employ the correspondence? To answer the first, it is of course possible to see a connection on a superficial level. All anthropomorphic systems are by nature to some degree homomorphic. (The illustrious Jung has shown in the course of several tomes that alchemy considered symbolically was a sort of search for 'wholeness' with much in common with his own brand of psychology.) The alchemy-Wake formulae are as follows: (a) Alchemists strove to render miscellaneous trash into a precious substance (gold) - Joyce made 'art' out of literary detritus. (b) The alchemists held that 'as above, so below' - Joyce held that the 'highest' ideals of the intellect and the 'lowest' sexual impulses stemmed from the same source. (c) The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 were considered significant by the alchemists - 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10 (and 7, 9, 28, 40, 111, 1001) are important in the Wake. (d) A bunch of charlatans used coloured dyes to fake gold - there are allusions to colours in the Wake and, furthermore, there is a strong 'forgery' motif (the correspondence positor is running out of wind here). And, finally, (e) Joyce peppered his text with various chemistry references - ergo, the alchemy claim has been proven beyond any doubt! But has it? In the passage from the general to the particular the argument loses much of its force. Ms DiBernard did at once too much and too little research. She crossed the Atlantic to examine the drafts in the British Museum but apparently did not make the shorter journey from Binghamton to Buffalo to search for source material in the notebooks. She read broadly in the alchemical literature; yet she failed to demons- trate that Joyce had preceded her in that survey. From the Wake drafts one can see that the main batch of allusions are in no sense 'structural' as they went in as additions to an already structured chapter (Book I, Section 7) in typescript and are thus no more nor less significant than, say, allu- sions to the culinary art. Even the word 'alshemist' is an afterthought, a replacement for 'shemist'. The cluster of chemical allusions sprinkled over the passage went in very late indeed (c. 1938) and derives from straight-forward chemistry (not alchemy) indexes. For instance, the word 'manganese' (FW 184.36) is related in this book to 'magnetia', an essential ingredient of the Philoso- pher's Stone, according to one Thomas Norton in The Ordinall of Alchimy, a book Ms DiBernard claims Joyce was alluding to directly. In fact, manganese' is simply 'manganese' and that is the form in which the unit is entered in Buffalo Notebook VI.B.45 in a context having no relation whatsoever to Norton. To sum up, while a case has been made that there are some similarities between what Joyce was doing and what the alchemists attempted, it has not been shown that Joyce intended this or even that it is significant for much of the Wake. For those (metaphorical) horses who like to read round a subject and have their hind legs talked off (and there are some) this is the book for them. Joycean scholars, however, will have to proceed more warily, keeping handy a few salt crystals. Danis Rose</page></plain_text>
