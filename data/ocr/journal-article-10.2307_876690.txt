<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Museum Acquisitions Acquisitions in The Department of Ceramics at The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (1968-7o) IT IS of course impossible to do full justice in the space of a short article to the acquisitions of a Department which covers a very wide field. For this reason we have attempted on the whole to deal with groups of pieces which are related and which represent a sustained effort to strengthen the Museum's collections in par- ticular fields. Acquisitions in the Far Eastern sphere have been excluded, since these form part of the collections under the care of the Far Eastern Section, formed as a separate entity in April I970. The Sections which follow have been written by different members of the Department. I: GLASS The glass collections of the Museum are already strong, and fairly well balanced, but with a pronounced bias in favour of English glass, as might be expected. This predominance was guaranteed by the Rees-Price gift of 463 pieces in 1925. It was to some ex- tent, however, counterbalanced by the accession in I936 of the Wilfred Buckley collection, probably the best all-round col- lection of glass which has ever been put together by a single person. In particular, it was forward-looking in its inclusion of excavated glasses from Iran, rare at that time, particularly some fine examples decorated with wheel-engraving in relief. Glasses of this character have since the second World War come on the market in increasing quantities, and many public and private collections formed. To the famous Buckley ewer, found in Iran but having close affinity in its relief-cut decoration with Fatimid Egyptian carved rock-crystals, the Victoria &amp; Albert has added one or two purchases, notably a clear, colourless bottle of unusual completeness, with relief-engraving of ex- ceptional quality. Aping this type of glass in shape and material, and superficially in its decoration, is a beaker also of clear, colourless glass and in a shape often found in the relief-cut glasses, but this one (fig.39) decorated with a skilfully trailed motif, done while the glass was still at working-heat, representing possibly a stylized inscription or the figure of a crane-like bird. The relief-cut glasses are of ninth-tenth-century date and the trail-decorated glass probably dates from towards the end of that period. Other types of medieval Iranian glass which have come on the market in increased quantities since the War include mould- blown bottles and ewers of probably eleventh-thirteenth-century date. In this field, the Museum has bought an exceptionally perfect honey-coloured ewer (Fig.41) with mould-blown dimpling on the body and a blue thread decorating the lip. Probably of comparable date are the drinking glasses on a tall stem, topped by a wide horizontal disc below a conical bowl, before the War known virtually only in fragments: of these the Museum has acquired (in 1967) a characteristic specimen, decorated on the bowl with applied blobs in green and colourless glass. Comparable with the revelation of Islamic Iran as a centre of fine-quality wheel-engraved glass has been the emergence of pre-Islamic Iran as a producer of glass of many sorts. The first realization that glass was as familiar in the Sassanian (A.D.226-636) dominions as it was further west came with the German excavations at Ctesiphon and the English digs at Kish and Barghutiat in Mesopotamia, published in 1934. At Kish were turned up, alongside glasses of characteristic Late East Roman types, dishes and bowls with facet-cutting of various kinds and bowls with vertical mould-blown ribbing, sometimes plain, sometimes spirally 'wrythen', sometimes pinched together into a mesh-design. Clearly the facet-cut glasses were luxury wares, a quality which ensured their preservation in treasuries such as those at Nara in Japan (the contents mainly of eighth- century date) and in St Mark's at Venice (looted from Con- stantinople in 1204 but of far earlier date, whether made in the Byzantine dominions or further East). A plain facet-cut hemi- spherical bowl of Nara type was acquired by the Museum in 1963. That Sassanian wheel-engraving techniques stood on a high level is proved by the central medallion of the famous 'Cup of Chosroes' from Saint-Denis, in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. This is engraved with a frontal portrait of a Sassanian king whose identity has been disputed, but has been confidently dated in the sixth century. A linear technique of wheel-engraving, of much less accomplishment, found also later in Islamic times, has been used to decorate the apparently unique rhyton in the form of a boot shown in Fig.4o. Down the back runs a serpentine thread, applied while the glass was still hot, presumably to represent a strap. This seems to be the first and by no means the least impressive, in a very long line of drinking-glasses made in the form of a boot, a line stretching right up to the eighteenth century. The rhyton (or drinking-vessel in a fanciful shape, usually anthropomorphic or theriomorphic) was a form much favoured in Iran from Achaemenid times onwards. The present example is made of pale green glass, itself in contrast with the normally perfectly colourless crystal glass used for wheel-engrav- ing in the Islamic period. Of the Sassanian glasses with mould-blown ribbing the Museum has been able to acquire one notable example (Fig.42). A footed hemispherical bowl of characteristic shape, it has a 329</page><page sequence="2">39. Beaker. Persian, probably tenth century A.D.

The surface of this glass is completely covered by a buff-coloured weathering deposit, but the glass-material appears originally to have been almost colourless. Of probably somewhat earlier date is a small hemispherical bowl (Fig.44) with flaring lip, made of greenish glass and decorated with horizontal rows of bosses made by means of tooling from a thick applied thread. It stands on a circle of small projecting 'toes' in a manner familiar from late Roman Syrian glass-making. Indeed, at this point in time, there are numerous echoes of late Roman glass, as in the case of an almost colourless bowl acquired by the Museum in 1967 (C.7o- 1967). It is decorated by means of large blobs and groups of three smaller dots of blue glass marvered into the wall of the vessel, and corresponds fairly closely to the Nuppenbecher ('cups with prunts') of Western Europe in the fourth century. Little excavation has hitherto taken place on securely dated Parthian sites (about 171 B.C. - A.D. 226), but it may confidently be expected that increasing quantities of glass from Iran will in future be identified as being of this period. A greenish glass cup acquired by the Museum in 1963 may well be of this date (C.133-I963). Of roughly mastos form, but with a slightly out- turned rim, it is cut with external horizontal grooves in a way thoroughly familiar elsewhere in Roman glass of the first century A.D. or earlier. Although a number of important Continental European glasses of post-Renaissance date have been acquired by the Museum in recent years, they do not present a group homogene- ous enough to be discussed here. In the field of English glass, however, a number of late-seventeenth-century pieces deserve mention. This was the period when English lead-glass, invented by George Ravenscroft in 1675/6, was finding its true character. Ravenscroft had probably mastered his material completely by 1677 but after his death in 168o English glass-makers still found difficulty in producing a trouble-free 'metal'. Many of the glasses of this period suffer from a physical imbalance which results in a break-down of the glass with visible symptoms which contemporaries called 'crizzeling' - a surface roughening of the glass and an internal decomposition marked by gleaming hair-like lines. In 1965 the Museum acquired a decanter-jug of this 'crizzeled' glass, which was decorated by the mesh- design already described as being produced by pinching to- gether adjacent lines of vertical mould-blown ribbing (C. I8- 1965). This well-known piece, originally from the C. Kirkby Mason collection, once formed a pair with a jug which allegedly had no lead in its composition. If this was correct, there was a case for the assumption that both were made in Ravenscroft's glasshouse, one from his earlier formula and one from his 'glass of lead'. A second example of this shape was acquired in 1969 (Fig.45). Like the first, it was of 'crizzeled' lead glass, but unlike it, was engraved on the wheel in the plain zone above a row of vertical ribs moulded on a 'second gather'. It is not known (although it is not impossible) that wheel engravers were settled in England about 1680-85, and since this engraving is Dutch in character, it seems rather more likely that the glasses were decorated in Holland. Two comparable examples are known, of which one is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, the other, en- graved with The Toilet of Venus, being in the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh. It seems possible that these glasses, which are usually furnished with seatings for a metal cover and which were of a form much favoured on the Continent, were made primarily with the Continental market in mind. By about 1690 the English glassmakers had perfected Ravens- croft's more or less experimental 'metal' by an increase in the ratio of lead-oxide which it contained. With this more pon- derous metal came a different style of treatment relying on a sort of glass turnery in which at first a rigidly simple profile was everything, and in which the dark but luminous glass material came fully into its own. A masterpiece of this 'baluster style' is the massive covered goblet of Fig.43. English covered goblets of this period are rare, but the ring-finial cover was by no means uncommon on the Continent of Europe. This glass bears in diamond-point the inscription 'Sr. (or St) Simon Boosington' - whether denoting a man or a church is a riddle at present unsolved. H: EARLY POTTERY Since the Second World War, no doubt stimulated by the excavations at Nishapur undertaken by the Metropolitan Museum, New York, there has been an increased flow on to the international market of Islamic pottery from East Persia. This includes types which, before the War, were normally only seen in the West in fragmentary form. The special technical discovery represented by this pottery was that one could paint under a lead glaze (normally so un- stable that an underglaze design 'slipped' disastrously), if the pigment was used in a diluted white clay mixture of creamy consistency. One of the handsomest styles in which this technique was employed used designs in a purple-black on a white ground which showed ivory in tone through the naturally slightly tinted lead glaze. Two handsome dishes of this class, with inscriptions of different styles, have been acquired by purchase for the Museum since the War, along with a number of other East Persian wares. The little bowl illustrated, however, a small masterpiece of its kind (Fig.46), was most generously given to the Museum by Lady Mallet, in memory of the late Sir Victor Mallet, G.C.M.G., C.V.O. This piece is decorated below the dentil rim-border with a dense zone of ornament consisting of four palmette-scrolls, strong and simple, with internal details scratched through the pigmented slip to the ivory ground. In the kindred field of Byzantine pottery, acquisition has long been inhibited by the fact that the wares have been virtually unobtainable. The progress of underwater exploration, however, has opened up new sources of supply, and the Department has in recent years obtained three dishes which formed part of the cargo of one or more wrecks in the Eastern Mediterranean. All are lead-glazed wares, with decoration incised through a layer of white 'slip' to the underlying red body, but whereas the example illustrated (Fig.47) and one other (C.32-1968) are drawn entirely in a linear technique, the third (C.74-I969) is rendered by cutting away the ground of the design, leaving it reserved in white on red. All three pieces date probably from the twelfth century. R. J. CHARLESTON II: SEVENTEENTH-CENTURr DELFTWARE Some of the most spectacular pieces of English seventeenth- century delftware are the deep dishes known to collectors as 'blue-dash chargers'. The most commonly found are those painted with Adam and Eve, tulips or portraits of Kings and Queens. Less common are dishes showing religious subjects, fruit or geometric patterns. In addition to these groups there is a miscellaneous assortment of other subjects including landscapes, ships and genre scenes. To this final group belongs the excep- tionally large charger shown in Fig.5I. The material, glaze and shape of this dish all confirm an English attribution as does the decoration on the border. This ornament is very close to that on a dish in the British Museum painted with a ship and dated I663. Comparable foliage and bell-like pods or flower-heads are found on two other dishes, The Sacrifice of Isaac dated 66(?5)5 in the 330</page><page sequence="5">46. Bowl.

Similar decoration is also found on two large drug jars dated I647 and 1656. The date range of all these pieces suggests that this type of ornament was used in England over a period of about twenty years in the middle of the seventeenth century. The border on the dish under discussion shows a debasement of this tradition, indicating a date around the latter end of this period, perhaps about I66o to 1670. The female figure shown in the centre can possibly be identified as 'Peace'. She holds a staff and proffers an olive-branch(?), while the piled arms, flag and drum, taken with the bird (dove?) in the foreground, assist such an interpretation. If this is the case and the date of the dish about i665, it may commemorate the end of the Second Dutch War in 1667. In common with so much delftware, attribution of this charger is uncertain. It was most probably made in London, as the industry was not established in the west country until the middle of the seventeenth century. An exception to this uncertainty is provided by the delightful dish of Fig.52. The plants and the colours employed are most distinctive and appear on a small group of dishes which, on the evidence of excavated fragments, have been shown to have been made at Brislington, near Bristol, around I68o. However, none of the other pieces in the group have anything like the strange awkward bird in the centre or the exotic butterflies that enliven this charger. Many seventeenth and eighteenth-century pieces of English delftware are painted with initials arranged in a triangle with a date underneath. These usually show that a marriage is being commemorated and can rarely be identified with any certainty. This is not the case, however, with a plate recently given to the Museum (Fig.53). Family tradition shows that this was made for the marriage of John (or Isaac) and Sarah Attfield in I676. This couple lived at Hallgrove in the Parish of Windlesham, Surrey, and the husband was churchwarden in 1678 when the church was rebuilt after a fire. It is unusual to find the wife's initial rather than the husband's surname at the apex of the triangle. Two other plates and two mugs are known painted with the same initials and hunting scene. All were probably made in London and the plates are particularly interesting since they seem to be the earliest polychrome examples known of this size. MICHAEL ARCHER IV: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURr PORCELAIN A pleasing recent accession to the Victoria and Albert's collections of eighteenth-century porcelain from Continental Europe is a plate from the Tournay factory (Fig.48). It is one of seven from the so-called 'de M.an Service' sold at Sotheby's on July 8th 1969, when items from the Van Zuylen collection were dispersed. The bulk of the 'de Mian Service' is now in the Musde de Mariemont, and other pieces are known elsewhere. The mouldings of the borders of the service derive from Meissen, and the enamelled decoration of flower-sprays and an estuary scene show something of the same influence. The enamelling is carried out in a distinctive crimson monochrome which cannot be truly appreciated under artificial light. Without ever entirely repeating himself in the whole range of this large service, the enameller has juggled with his repertoire of buildings, rocks, water and feathery trees to produce a well-balanced design, excellently proportioned to fit the plate. A gilt ornament, set somewhat like a wall-bracket beneath the central scene, establishes a firm horizontal line. The initials 'ID' enamelled in crimson underneath this plate are thought to indicate that it was enamelled by Joseph Duvivier, who was chief painter to the Tournay factory from 1763 till his death in 1771. This artist is said to have come from England, and it is usually conjectured that he had been working at Chelsea. In looking for resemblances between Chelsea decoration and such a piece as Fig. 48, however, we must not forget that the all-pervasive influence of Meissen was common to both Tournay and Chelsea. If this particular Duvivier had worked at Chelsea (and we must beware of confusion with other painters of the same name) then he would probably have worked there alongside J. H. O' Neale, the enameller responsible for the saucer shown in Fig.49. This saucer is not, however, of Chelsea but of Chinese porcelain. During the I760's O'Neale probably either turned freelance or worked for an outside decorators' establishment, besides ex- hibiting at the Incorporated Society of Artists. The saucer belonged to the remnants of a tea-service painted in green over black outlines and with gilt dentil edges. The saucer, however, was of particular interest to the Museum for the fact that the words 'Owen Rowe O'Neale' can be distinctly made out a- mongst the otherwise meaningless squiggles on the obelisk. One is reminded of the only Chelsea porcelain piece on which the name O'Neale is convincingly legible, a pierced oval fruit- stand of about 1755 formerly in the Major W. H. Tapp collection. This Chelsea piece has the name 'oneale' amongst a gibberish inscription on an obelisk. Prints, drawings and Worcester porcelain vases bearing O'Neale's signature are all recorded, and comparison with such signed work leaves little room for doubt that Fig.49 is by this artist. Yet 'Owen Rowe O'Neale' cannot be a signature for Jefferyes Hamett O'Neale, and must surely mean that the obelisk commemorates the Irish general and patriot Owen Roe O'Neill (I59o?-1 649). We should probably think of the painting on this saucer and on the Chelsea basket as miniature essays in the genre of 'imaginary tombs' popularized by McSwiny's commissions of the I720's to the Ricci, Canaletto and other Italian artists. That J. H. O'Neale was, or conceived himself to be related to the sixteenth-century hero is possible; or perhaps he chose this way to conceal his signature. The ceramic historian develops a certain wariness when supposed hidden signatures are drawn to his attention, but although it must be invisible in a small reproduction, there is no doubt that writing lies concealed in the hind-wing of one of the three butterflies at the centre of the Derby plate shown in Fig.5o. The name starts clearly enough: 'Thos F.. .'. After that the inscriber ran out of space, and only two more vertical strokes can be discerned. The piece is in a style popular at Derby in the 1760's. If this is really an artist's signature we shall per- haps in time discover whose. Fig.55 is a bowl and cover of the class of English soft paste porcelain known by the cumbrous name, 'Girl-in-a-Swing', after the Museum's own white figure of a girl swinging on a rope between two branches. These branches are applied with leaves of the same form as those on the lid of the Victoria and Albert's newly acquired covered bowl and on the pair to it illustrated in the Transactions of the English Ceramic Circle for 1967 and now in Mrs R. M. Robertson's collection at Galt, Ontario. The paste of these covered bowls is very similar to many pieces of the 'Girl-in-a-Swing' class. No marked pieces of 'Girl-in-a- Swing' porcelain are recorded, and until recently it was thought that only figures and such things as scent bottles were made. A few figures are enamelled with flowers in much the same style as the covered bowl, but of course the painter has here had a wider and smoother area on which to deploy his decorative skill. The 'Girl-in-a-Swing' porcelains still await a definite attribution, but the most plausible theory about their origins is that proposed in the Transactions of the English Ceramic Circle for 1962 by Arthur Lane and R. J. Charleston, namely that they were made by some 333</page><page sequence="8">RECENT MUSEUM ACQUISITIONS workmen who seceded in 1749 from Sprimont's Chelsea factory to set up a rival concern, perhaps also in Chelsea. The bowl shown in Fig. 54 belongs to an even more mysterious class, neither truly of soft nor of hard paste. An Italian origin has sometimes been proposed for this rare group, which has been named 'A' marked porcelain by reason of the letter 'A' which is sometimes either painted in underglaze blue or incised under- neath, though the present piece is not so marked. In a paper due to appear in the Transactions of the English Ceramic Circle for 1971, R. J. Charleston and the present writer propose a British origin for the group, but have not identified the manufacturers. Nicholas Crisp at Vauxhall or Alexander Lind at Gorgie near Edinburgh are suggested as possible candidates. The enamelled decoration on the present piece is particularly ambitious, and represents the Miser and Plutus and Cupid, Hymen and Plutus, probably copied from engravings in one of the editions of Gay's Fables, though the exact source of the designs has not yet been traced. Some other pieces from the 'A' marked group are painted with scenes after Hubert Gravelot, who worked in England from 1733-45- J. V. G. MALLET V: EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY CERAMICS A significant figure in the revival of stoneware pottery at the end of the last century and the beginning of this was the Flemish-born potter Henri Simmen. Working at Meudon, he evolved a highly individual style using brown stoneware painted in black enamel with touches of gold. His shapes follow natural, smooth lines of great simplicity and gravity, decorated with geometric patterns looking like cloisonnde' enamel, sinuous plant forms or female figures reminiscent of the work of Toorop. He is known to have deliberately sought the haphazard colour effects consequent on using impure pigments and he took this a stage further by sub- mitting his pots to the vagaries of the kiln by firing them un- protected by saggars. In his attitude to the accidental he was a precursor of many artists working fifty years later but in its appearance his pottery perfectly mirrors the decorative style of the turn of the century. The pot in Fig.57 is a typical example of Simmen's work. Of about the same date but of more typically art nouveau form is a fish service made by the Nymphenburg factory (Fig.56). This comprises a large oval dish, a sauce-boat attached to its stand and twelve plates, of which one is illustrated here. It can be associated with the painter Hermann Gradl and the sculptor and painter Louis Levallois, who was employed at Nymphenburg from 1901o to igo6. In the factory records there is a sketch for the sauce boat in the service signed by Levallois and dated 1903. It has been suggested by the factory authorities that the designs for the painted decoration were done by Professor Gradl, who was associated with the factory in a free-lance capacity from 1904-06. Although the dark, vigorous stoneware of the vase by Simmen could not be more unlike the silky brilliance of the porcelain of this Nymphenburg service, there is an assured sophistication common to both that places them at the highest level of achieve- ment in the European decorative arts of their period.
