<plain_text><page sequence="1">Witness of Indian Religion Present-Day Concepts of the Guardian Spirit BY JUNE RANDOLPH During aboriginal times the concept of religious power as derived from personal spirits found its highest point of development in the area of Western America commonly called the "Pla- teau." This was a region of relative cultural homogeneity extending from the Cascade Moun- tains on the west to the Rocky Mountains on the east, and on the north from Northern British Columbia to the California-Oregon boundary on the south. Near the geographical center of the area were situated the Sanpoil Indians, a tribe whose development of the concept of a personal guardian spirit was perhaps the richest and most completely organized of any tribe in the vast area - the greater part of the North American continent - in which the concept flourished. The Sanpoil lived in the "big bend" region of the Columbia River, presently the site of Grand Coulee Dam and the lower portion of Roosevelt Lake. Neighbors of the Sanpoil who very nearly equaled them in their emphasis upon guardian spirit religion and their development of ideas pertaining to it included the Columbia tribe immediately to the south (sometimes called the Moses-Columbia after their famous chief), the Southern Okanogan directly to the west, the Chelan of Chelan Lake and the adjoining Co- lumbia River Valley, the small Entiat tribe of the Entiat River Valley, and the large Wenatchee tribe of the river and valley of the same name and the adjacent Columbia Valley. All of these tribes spoke more or less mutually intelligible dialects of the interior division of the Salish linguistic stock. They were undoubtedly very early inhabitants of the central Plateau, as recent archeological work shows, and each had lived for centuries in the habitat occupied by them at the time of discovery. At present they all live on the Colville Indian reservation, an area of about a million and a half acres in Okan- ogan and Ferry counties. They share the res- ervation with the Lake and Colville tribes whose development of the guardian spirit religion was also notable but who are not treated in this paper. The bulk of the reservation area is land aboriginally held by the Sanpoil tribe. (Follow- ing Ray, the term Sanpoil is here used to include the Nespelem, a small group aboriginally cen- tered on the Nespelem River. Although politi- cally independent, the Nespelem were identical to the Sanpoil both dialectically and cultur- ally.) All the tribes mentioned are so-called non- treaty Indians, the government never having entered into a treaty with them. The reservation was set aside by executive order on July 2, 1872, and the remainder of their lands were taken by the government. The Indian Claims Commis- sion 84 years later - in 1956 - handed down an opinion substantiating the claim of these tribes to the bulk of the lands which the Indians have maintained were taken from them without com- pensation; tribal members are now engaged in litigation before federal courts for the righting of past wrongs. The Indians gain their livelihood primarily from cattle raising and lumbering on the res- ervation. Off -reservation Indians serve as skilled laborers, foresters, surveyors, teachers, lawyers, nurses, and secretaries, to mention only a few of the positions they hold in various parts of the United States. It is obvious that much of the aboriginal life has disappeared for the Sanpoil and their neigh- bors, that the process of acculturation has pro- gressed far. However, my field researches on the reservation during 1956 have made it abundantly clear that the old religious beliefs have been June Randolph is a graduate student in anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Supernatural "power" still is essential for under- standing and controlling the universe, perhaps even more so - in some respects at least - than in former times. Boys and girls still receive guardian spirits during adolescence, even as they did long ago.1 ./. W. Thompson, Photographer Madeline Covington This is not to say that there have been no changes. Ray, Cline, and others have described the concepts and practices of pre-white times.2 It is my purpose here to describe these changes and to interpret and evaluate the data I was able to gather during a brief period of field work in 1956. Because I am writing of contemporary phenomena, I shall use contemporary phrase- ology. In English speech the Indian uses the word "power" to cover all phases of the guardian spirit concept, both nominal and active. He says "my power" when the anthropologist would write "my guardian spirit," and he uses the same phrase to mean "my spiritual strength" or "my supernatural force." This is the result neither of linguistic deficiency nor of mental confusion. However adequate or inadequate the term "power" might have been as a translation of a native term for an aboriginally held belief, it is today the only satisfactory word because the concept is a part of the contemporary society oí the Indian and his language is English. Some of the younger people do not even know the Salish language, to say nothing of being able to use it. Terminological considerations apart, it is clear that the fundamental character of religious belief is the same now as earlier. For the San- poil and their neighbors, power is a supernat- ural force conferred upon an individual by a spirit who becomes the protector and ally of that individual. The usual term, "guardian spirit," while literally quite correct, puts too much emphasis upon the entity, too little on the force. A better term, at least in some contexts, would be "personalized force." The concept encompasses a broad and sig- nificant set of attitudes and patterns of behavior which are inextricably entwined in the Indian's ideas about himself in relation to nature and the universe. Success in life was in the past almost impossible without the aid of this personalized force. In the fullest sense, it may still be so today. The spirit associated with this force, and in a sense responsible for it, possesses both zoomor- phic and anthropomorphic characteristics but is usually thought of in the latter form. It is felt that one's spirit will "walk with him" all through his days and that the power conferred will be his throughout. A person talks to his power and calls on it in times of danger to pro- tect him from the malicious, covetous, and often terrifying, powers of others. In early times he was never without some adornment or aspect oi dress symbolic of his power, and this served as a warning, a boast, and an inspiration. The symbol is conceptually present today, even though not tangibly so. a The field data for this paper were gathered on the Colville Indian reservation during August, 1956. I lived for the month with Clara Moore, aged 76, who was my principal informant. Her mother was Sanpoil, her father part Cherokee and part white. She was born on the res- ervation and has lived there all her life. She was an alert and intelligent informant. She had not learned to read or write English. Another informant was George Nanam- kin, 48, an Entiat whose mother was part Wenatchee; he had two years of high school education and has served at the Colville Agency as interpreter; an intelligent in- formant with a good understanding of both white and Indian cultures. Lucy Covington, 45, provided informa- tion for the Columbia tribe. She has lived most of her life on the Colville reservation in the former home of the famous Columbia chief, Moses, to whom she is re- lated. She is literate and active in Indian affairs. Several other informants provided bits of information. For advice and assistance, I am indebted to Dr. Wil- liam A. Lessa, Dr. George P. Murdock, Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Daniels, Jr., Mr. H. C. Fassett, and Dr. Clement W. Meighan. 140 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY</page><page sequence="3">A proper understanding of the conceptual foun- dation of this personalized force demands a knowledge of native mythological explanations which are as significant to belief today as ever. Ray describes the Sanpoil theory of genesis as follows: During mythological times there were no human beings; neither were there guardian spirits. But the beings of that time possessed attributes of both. Their physical and psychological differentiae were those of animals, but for the most part they appeared in the superficial guise of men. The animal form as such was taken only when an emergency demanded. They sought no spirit power since they possessed it inherently. "When people came on earth," it is explained, "these beings became the spirits." But in the new era the dominant form became that of the animal; the man-like form was taken only when in communion with men. Human beings appeared at the same time, inheriting as their guise the prevalent form of the previous beings. But men did not receive the power to reciprocate with their spirits and appear in animal form. This was possible, in modification, only in cere- monial identification.» The identification or transformation to which Ray refers is that which sometimes occurred at winter dances, when persons with certain powers, particularly Bluejay, would act as much as pos- sible like the supernatural predecessors of a mythological era. In aboriginal times power was acquired as a consequence of success during an adolescent quest which took the seeker into out-of-the-way places for periods varying from one night to five days or more. The variety of animal-like spirits ranged from bear to lark, rattlesnake to mos- quito, or even inanimate objects. Salmon, deer, bear, and coyote were the most common, and the grizzly bear was the most powerful. The weakest but most gentle power was the hum- mingbird, usually reserved for women. Traditionally the novice was sent to a par- ticular destination and given some object to de- posit at that spot, usually a worthless but dis- tinctive item, such as a piece of a broken arrow. Some symbolic or otherwise meaningful activity was also frequently specified, such as swimming in a lake or building piles of stones. One in- formant mentioned an unusual instruction: he was often given a flute to carry. Among my older informants, one Sanpoil woman was first sent to seek power when she was ten years old. That was in 1890. She con- tinued her quests intermittently until she was fourteen. Time after time she was sent to the confluence of the Sanpoil and Columbia rivers, and the day following each of her visits her father went to the spot to see if the object had been deposited as prescribed. Power came to the seeker in a vision, usually appearing in human form. It spoke to the child, then changed to animal-like guise and disap- peared. In later life - but only after initiation into the company of winter dancers - it reap- peared when its assistance was needed. Chief Moses apparently was initiated at a very early age. It is said that his power was always very strong. He killed many people from the time he was twelve years old. He was shot many times but the bullets couldn't enter his body. His power was "Turtle" whose hard shell nothing could pierce. Once the American soldiers led him and his companions into a trap. The night before the intended betrayal, which Moses did not suspect, his power Turtle came to him and said, "I told you when you were a little boy that I would protect you. Take that little brown horse and run away. The soldiers are plan- ning to hang all of you." Moses took the horse and escaped into the night. The other Indians were hanged but Moses was saved because of his power. This took place at what is now called Hangman's Creek. It is highly probable that Sanpoil, and pos- sibly Columbia, parents still send their children on power-seeking quests, although informants state that the quest is no longer a practice among these tribes. One informant declared that "almost everyone today has a power song" and added that during the winter dances of 1955 "so many people sang their power songs that each person had time only to sing a line or two of his song." Since no one possesses such a song unless he has obtained a guardian spirit, and no one may sing such a song or lead the accompanying dance unless he has been initiated as a spirit- possessing person, it follows that most Sanpoil, old and young, have gone on power-seeking quests. Furthermore, since power is not usually achieved before adolescence, it follows that the many young participants in the singing and dancing at the winter ceremonies must have been on quests relatively recently. To Dr. Verne F. Ray I express my appreciation for helpful criticism and much assistance in the writing of this paper. 2 See Verne F.

OCTOBER, 1957 HI</page><page sequence="4">It could be, of course, that some alternative method of obtaining power has come into being. There is no evidence to this effect for the San- poil, but the Columbia do receive power, at least occasionally, during dreams or in other ways apart from the quest. A Columbia inform- ant told of the fortuitous acquisition of power in this manner: My brother and I and some other members of our family were berry-picking at Moses Mountain. When I returned to camp, I found my brother sleeping. An old man was watching over him. I started to waken my brother, but the old man told me not to do so. He said that it would ruin his dream that was giving him power. There are two possibilities here: that a change has taken place from quest to dream in the acquisition of power by Columbia Indians, or that the Columbia have always recognized dreams as well as visions as sources of power. Since we have no descriptions of the aboriginal religious patterns of the Columbia Indians, the question cannot be definitively resolved. How- ever, the incident referred to in the above ac- count occurred more than thirty years ago, a time when aboriginal patterns were still quite strong. The same informant recounted that once a bear was killed near her home. Her father told her to go to the bear and feel its paw so that she would grow up to be a good berry-picker. (Being afraid, she did not do so.) This suggests that there may have been even another mode of acquiring power among the Columbia. Or it may merely have been an example of contagious magic, known to this tribe, or a vague reflection of the bear ceremonialism which is widespread in the northern hemisphere. It also appears that among the Columbia the personalized force of power might, at least re- cently, be acquired during a shamanistic curing ceremony - a very different setting from that of the quest. In an instance recited by an inform- ant the power was received even in the face of an uncooperative attitude on the part of the recipient. The latter, a sister of the informant, was about eighteen years old (ca. 1940) when she was confined to her bed with an illness which left her "nothing but skin and bones." A winter dance was being held at the time at the home of her stepfather. One night some of the dancers visited the sick girl and told her that she must sing, as if she were at the dance, or she would die. She refused to do so, nor would she leave her bed. The others then started to sing around her as she lay in her modern bed. Suddenly the girl sat up and clasped her hands to her mouth as if to keep a song from coming out. Then her body stiffened, she started to sing, and fell in a faint. Thereupon other dancers came, and shamans accompanied them. They prepared the house for a curing ceremony by taking out all the fur- niture and cleaning the place. They removed the modern bed, but they left a mattress for the patient rather than have her lie on the bare floor as would have been proper in earlier times. The following night a dance was held around the patient. At first she remained on the mat- tress, but later the people helped her to her feet, and she sang power songs and danced through- out the night. To everyone's amazement, she sang the power song of a famous chief of an- other tribe, a man who was related to her. It was said that he had sent his power to help cure her. The dance continued the next night. By the third night the girl was cured of her illness, but she continued to dance for a total of five nights, all the while without eating any food. Every year since that time she sings her power song at the winter dances. It is said that her power is very strong, that she can tell so accu- rately where deer are to be found that her brother finds them easily and always kills "about five." (Five, the pattern number of this tribe, is obvi- ously still functioning.) This may be an example of the relatively rare spirit-ghost power - that is, power received from the guardian spirit of a person now deceased - which is known for the Sanpoil but not before recorded for the Columbia. However, the pat- tern is considerably variant from the Sanpoil, and we must recognize that the Columbia may, at least today, consider a successful curing cere- mony in the setting of the winter spirit dance as an occasion for obtaining new power. A young Entiat informant stated that "acquir- ing power is like Bingo; sometimes the most un- expected people get it." He cited the case of his aunt who was "afraid of her own shadow." When she was sent on a night time quest, she always stayed close to camp, and even went to sleep - all contrary to instructions. Even so, she later became a strong medicine woman - shaman - which presupposes not merely one strong power, but several. The same informant spoke of his own vision quest as a terrifying experience. "I could see objects moving all around me. I was afraid and wanted to run." This took place about 1920. 142 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY</page><page sequence="5">As in the old days, power is thought to dimin- ish with age. But now a new idea has been added: it also diminishes with excessive drink- ing of liquor. In 1955 the Plateau geographic area experi- enced an unusually severe winter. The heavy snowfalls of the season had been preceded by a spirit dance in which a woman had danced to bring snow. Only Grizzly Bear power is consid- ered to be able to bring about such a snowfall. ("The grizzly bear likes deep snow because then it can successfully attack stock and even men.") The people had not thought that this woman had such power, but they were convinced by the deep snows and now credit her with superior power. These examples serve to illustrate, but in no sense to exhaust, the concepts and practices of the present day as to the personalized force which played so very significant a role in aboriginal life. Acculturation and innovation are obvious, and the Indian of today clearly has a choice among numerous alternatives. But these are marks of virility in culture, not decay. The spirit-ghost concept, mentioned above, is receiving greater emphasis today than for- merly, but a greater freedom of choice is now possible. The present-day variety of winter spirit dance is especially designed to appease spirits which were associated with persons no longer living. These spirits desire to reinvest living relatives. The spirit-ghost causes the illness of the intended recipient, and the assumption is that one may become well only by giving a dance at which the spirit is taken as one's own. This necessitates engaging a shaman to supervise the dance and paying all of the expenses. It fur- ther means that the recipient or his family is obligated henceforth to sponsor a dance annu- ally. The acceptance of spirit-ghost power is a social responsibility because it is felt that the more power there is in operation in the commu- nity the better it is for all. Furthermore, nearly all persons are interested in having as many dances to attend each winter as practicable. A prominent Sanpoil woman, now elderly, was told by the community that she should give a dance and receive the power of a certain de- ceased aunt. Despite continued pressure this woman was able to refuse, which she did to avoid the expense and responsibilities. It is true that she was a person of social prestige who had previously proved her usefulness to the commu- nity and thus was free to act more independently than would otherwise have been the case. How- ever, in aboriginal times even such a person would have been more concerned with the opinions of people and the religious conse- quences of refusal. ./. W. Thompson, Photographer George Nanamkin and Clara Moore The shaman, religious leader and curer of the sick, demonstrates most dramatically and most significantly the nature of the personalized force of power. His role today is greatly reduced as compared to aboriginal times, but significantly it is still essential to community life. He func- tions rather little as a curer, or so it seems, but one should exercise caution in stating a conclu- sion here, since such activities are often covert and their prominence thus apt to be underesti- mated. Only a few years ago the Sanpoil sha- man's services as a doctor were still depended upon far more than those of white physicians. But every winter the guardian spirit dances are held (in the 1950's as well as in the 1850's), and here the services of the shaman as religious lead- er are indispensable. These dances, and the shaman's role therein, are discussed below. But first I shall describe a few relatively recent in- stances of shamanistic curing as illustrations of cultural stability and change. OCTOBER, 1957 14*</page><page sequence="6">A prominent man living on the Yakima In- dian reservation became ill. He sent a young Entiat man sixty miles in a taxicab to bring back the messenger's aunt, a famous shaman. When she arrived, furniture was moved from the house, and the curing ceremony took place with about fifteen persons present to assist in the dancing and singing. The shaman used the "shaking method" of treatment, an aboriginal form, but did no sucking. The patient, an elderly man, was getting weak, and "something was wrong with his power song." In two days the Entiat shaman had achieved a cure. The patient paid her $100 and some blankets, be- sides paying the large taxi fee. In another Entiat case, a young man fell from his horse during a race and was run over by several other horses. A white physician said the injured man would die, whereupon a shaman was called. The treatment involved shaking and the drawing-out process, another aboriginal prac- tice. During the treatment the injured man is remembered suddenly to have sat upright, say- ing "I'm hungry." According to the informant, the man was completely cured and rode in the races again the next day. He is also said to have been "entirely sane," a phrase recalling the traditional notion that an unconscious person was either dead or insane. The sequence is reversed in a Sanpoil case. An elderly woman was seriously ill and called for a shaman. The doctor treated her in a com- pletely traditional manner but to no avail. He said that his power was not strong enough and that the patient would have to have "knife work." Thereupon he left, taking the advance payment of a blanket. When the patient heard the pronouncement, she gave up hope, but her daughter took the shaman's advice and took the sick woman to a hospital in Spokane. The daughter was permitted to watch the compli- cated surgery from which her mother recovered to live twenty-five more years. The daughter attributes the success of the surgeon not to surgical skill but to a "power stronger at that time than that of the Indian doctor." A young Entiat man who has frequently had occasion to compare the abilities of Indian and white doctors, as a consequence of being treated by both, reports success by the latter as against the former in cases where he believes that the malignant action of a shaman has caused the illness in the first place. Speaking of the draw- ing-out process, he says that "Indian doctors are blessed with magnetic powers in their hands." A Sanpoil woman of advanced years told of a shaman's diagnosis of an illness which she suf- fered after a long forced swim in the Columbia River. He said that the malady was the malig- nant work of a power sent by an old man whom she had once refused to marry. The woman today says that she thinks she had pneumonia. A discussion of the winter ceremonies must recognize that there are factors other than those of religious conservatism which favor their con- tinuance into the present. Today, as yesterday, the long cold months of winter provide the San- poil with a relatively greater amount of free time than at other seasons, and boredom often be- comes a threat. The power dances offer a dra- matic and colorful activity when the community can come together to satisfy common emotional and spiritual needs. Where the individualism and competition of contemporary life threaten tribal unity, the winter dances promote group identification and group solidarity. Here everyone - for it seems to be that today - may participate in activities characterized by religious excitation, joy, and mystery. Power is a ubiquitous element in the room; all are exposed to its currents. Shamans struggle to make an impression on their audi- ence; they even struggle to steal one another's power as of old. The songs and dances, all tra- ditional, all colorful and hypnotic, provide drama and spectacle. The dance house is of frame construction but in pattern is much like the old mat houses. The house is one large room withN the traditional pole in the center. Outside the snow crowds the long, low building; above the stars are bright. No change in all this. A listener hears the same sounds from inside as his ancestor heard cen- turies ago. Little wonder that the dances live on as an escape from the contemporary world and as a rewarding dramatic experience. But the winter dances of today are more than that. They are still occasions for the manipu- lation of the supernatural. The spirits are close by. Power is renewed through the dancing and singing of power songs. Power is demonstrated, not only by shamans but by lay possessors, too. Power is used to end the cold weather and snow of a hard winter. The dances serve also as food renewal ceremonies. Those who possess the powers of deer, camas, salmon, and the like, sing and dance for an abundance of these prod- ucts, and their importance today, both economi- cally and psychologically, is very considerable. It is interesting to note that the economic re- sponsibility of the sponsor of a dance seems to 144 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY</page><page sequence="7">be greater today than in aboriginal times. No longer is the provision of food and other neces- sities for the comfort of the dancers a general responsibility, but rather the specific duty of the sponsor. Furthermore, it is he who must pro- vide all the small gifts which are distributed toward the end of the dance period. This change is perhaps correlated with the coming of a money economy. But another shift of emphasis cannot be explained as acculturational. The rationale for giving presents is now to "pacify the spirits/' not merely to show friendship and good will toward fellow dancers. Spirits seem to be gaining rather than losing status as the years go by. Children still learn at an early age the be- havior of shamans, the character of the ceremo- nial songs and dances, and the potency of power. Whenever their parents are present at dances, they are present, too. In the dance house the children must be more than usually obedient. They must remain quiet and be alert lest the power which is rampant cause them ill. Ordi- narily they are not permitted to dance, but oc- casionally an adult will start his power song and then announce that the children are to dance. He promises to "watch and protect" them during their dancing so that they may be kept safe from any malignant power that may be about. Another special class, menstruating women, are not permitted in the dance house at all - an old prohibition. Religious acculturation has worked in both directions among the Sanpoil and their white neighbors. During one extremely severe winter large numbers of livestock were dying. Two prominent white stockgrowers offered to pay a famous Sanpoil shaman to sponsor a dance lor the bringing of milder weather. The shaman acceded when the men brought food for the dance and pleaded with h ini to "take pity" on them and their livestock. The dance was held in the shaman's house, which soon became so crowded with participants that the stockmen were obliged to procure more food by midnight of the second night. At that time the people were told by the shaman ist ic leader that there would be a sign if the dance were to be success- ful. Just then a coyote howled, and an elderly woman dancer declared the sign had come. By morning there was a "Chinook wind" blowing, and soon the snow was melting rapidly. The many white spectators at the dance were fully convinced of the efficacy of power. Finally, it appears that power is a more social thing for the Sanpoil and their neighbors than it was in pre-white times - the basic nature of the guardian spirit religion being individualistic. It has already been mentioned that the Sanpoil feel that the more power there is "operating" in the community, the better for the commu- nity. More people appear to have power, as exemplified by guardian spirit songs, than for- merly, albeit it may not be as strong or as hard to get. Furthermore, the people now speak of power being "rampant" and that "the most un- expected people get it." This suggests that power is changing character: it is becoming less personal, more impersonal. It also suggests the Polynesian concept of impersonal power: mana. Perhaps the religion of the Indian tribes of cen- tral Washington is moving in that direction.</page></plain_text>
