<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERTOLT BRECHT, LOGICAL EMPIRICISM, AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOURISM Until relatively recently, philosophy of science in the Western world had, for a century or more, been dominated by positivism. Whereas nowadays the positivist doctrines of objectivity and factuality appear to have been eclipsed by purveyors of paradigms and initiates of incommensurability, in Brecht's day the logical empi- ricist variant of positivism represented the radical and progressive cutting edge of scientific philosophy.1 Given Brecht's well-known fascination with theoretical advances in modern science, it is not surprising that he should have developed an intense interest in logical empiricism, an interest which was at its peak in 1931 when he was working on Der Dreigroschenprozefi.2 My aim in this article is to document the impact of logical empiricism on Brechtian theory in the early I930s, and establish the precise nature of his response to it. I begin by giving a general outline of the epistemological concerns of logical empiricism, positivism, and pragmatism, and then review existing scholarly accounts of Brecht's reception of logical empiricism, which for many years tended to focus too narrowly on his relationship to behaviourism. Unpublished material held in the Bertolt-Brecht-Archiv is analysed in order to give an initial characterization of Brecht's reactions to the philosophical doctrines of logical empiricism, the impact of which on his theoretical writings in 193I/2, in particular Der DreigroschenprozeJ3, is then considered in some detail. My general thesis is that Brecht's response to logical empiricism was one of critical fascination, embedded in a prior commitment to philosophical pragmatism and Marxist social theory. In his perceptive analysis of Marxist epistemology in 'Karl Marx and the Classical Definition of Truth',3 Leszek Kolakowski argues that the end of the nineteenth century saw the articulation of two distinct but related conceptions of truth, positivist and pragmatist, both of which played a crucial role not only in European and North American philosophy but in Marxist theory also. Logical empiricism, more commonly referred to as logical positivism, may be seen as a 1 Leszek Kolakowski gives an admirably lucid account of the historical development of positivism in Positivist Philosophy: From Hume to the Vienna Circle (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972), while a useful survey of the work of the Vienna Circle may be found in Manfred Geier, Der Wiener Kreis (Reinbek: Rowohlt, 1992). The most concise presentation of logical empiricism in English remains A.J. Ayer, Language, Truth and Logic (London: Gollancz, 1967: first published I936), while more recent trends in the philosophy of science are well illustrated in Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1962), and Paul Feyerabend, Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge (London: Verso, 1978). Trenchant critiques of all the above positions in the philosophy of science, particularly in terms of their impact on the social sciences, may be found in Martin Hollis and Edward Nell, Rational Economic Man: A Philosophical Critique of Neo-Classical Economics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), Martin Hollis, Models of Man: Philosophical Thoughts on Social Action (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I977), and, from a Marxist viewpoint, in Roy Bhaskar, The Possibility of Naturalism: A Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Human Sciences (Brighton: Harvester Press, I979). 2 See Bertolt Brecht, Der DreigroschenprozeJ3, in Bertolt Brecht, Werke, GroBe kommentierte Berliner und Frankfurter Ausgabe, ed. by Werner Hecht and others, 3ovols (Berlin and Weimar: Aufbau; Frank- furt a.M.: Suhrkamp, I989- ), xxI: Schriften i (I992), 448-514.

First, positivism rejects the distinction between 'essence' and 'phenomenon', on the grounds that observed experience is the touchstone for all knowledge claims. Second, positivism adopts a nominalist approach to the status of abstract concepts, arguing that these must refer to individual concrete objects. Third, positivism radically questions the cognitive validity of value-judgements and normative statements, because these cannot be justified with reference to experience. Fourth, positivism insists on the unity of scientific method, thereby denying that there is any fundamental distinction between the natural and the social sciences. Logical empiricism sharpened up the positivist critique of metaphysics by concentrating on linguistic analysis in order to establish categorically the nature of scientific statements. Its most notorious doctrine was the principle of verifiability, according to which the meaning of a statement equals the method of its verification. Logical empiricism therefore dismissed the philosophical pretensions of traditional metaphysics and theology as meaningless, and also contended that all assertions of value are not scientific but emotive.6 As a result, when applied to the sciences, logical empiricism was associated with behavourism and with the demand that science be value-free. Like its philosophical contemporary positivism, pragmatism wished to assess claims to knowledge on the basis of experience. Whereas positivism, however, took this to mean that truth involved 'the relation between ajudgement or a sentence and the reality to which it refers' (CDT, p. 59), pragmatism identified practical useful- ness as the prime criterion in epistemological matters, so much so that, as Kolakowski indicates, usefulness effectively creates meaning and truth: The truth ofajudgement is defined as a practical function of the usefulness of its acceptance or rejection. The meaning of ajudgement is literally the same as the practical usefulness that the person who adopts this judgement derives from the influence that his acceptance of it has on his behaviour. (CDT, p. 61) This emphasis on usefulness also entails an important distinction between pragma- tism and logical empiricism because, from a pragmatist point of view, the logical empiricist insistence on disinterested observation and value-free science is in- coherent. For, as Kolakowski argues in his elucidation of the early Marx's prag- matist theory of truth: To ask how the world would be seen by an observer whose essence was pure thinking and whose consciousness was defined exclusively by a disinterested cognitive effort, is to ask a barren question, for all consciousness is actually born of practical needs, and the act of cognition itself is a tool designed to satisfy those needs. (CDT, pp. 64-65) As I shall show, Brecht subscribes to just such a theory of truth, and develops a pragmatist critique of logical empiricist epistemology. 4 See Kolakowski, Positivist Philosophy, pp. 203-40 (esp. pp. 230-40). 5 Kolakowski, Positivist Philosophy, pp. I I-19. 6 See Ayer, pp. 33-35, 102-19.</page><page sequence="3">STEVE GILES The nature and importance of Brecht's interest in the philosophical doctrines of the Vienna Circle has tended to be obscured by critical controversy concerning the presence or otherwise of behaviourist features in his works, especially those of the late I920S and early 1930s. Rosenbauer's classic I970 study Brecht und der Behavio- rismus7 argued that there were clear parallels between Brecht's work and be- haviourist psychology, in that both concentrated on behaviour rather than on action, on observable processes rather than on introspection, and on environ- mentally conditioned reflexes rather than on subjectivity.8 Although Rosenbauer also conceded that Brecht's thinking on such matters could not be reduced to any one position, he insisted none the less that behaviourism exerted a pervasive influence on Brecht's theory and practice up to the end of his career. Writing one year later than Rosenbauer, John J. White expressed a degree of scepticism concerning the extent of Brecht's commitment to behaviourism, but nevertheless identified behaviourist features in Brecht's work from the mid-I93os onwards.9 More fundamental doubts about Brecht's relationship to behaviourism surfaced in Jan Knopf's Forschungsbericht, as will be seen later in discussion of Der Dreigroschen- prozef3. Knopf's approach is particularly important because, unlike Rosenbauer and White, he is aware that behaviourism must itself be understood in terms of a radical philosophical empiricism: Der Behaviorismus stammt aus der philosophischen Richtung des sog. empirischen Radika- lismus, der in zwei Richtungen wirksam geworden ist: erstens innerhalb der Naturwissen- schaften und der Philosophie als sog. Operationalismus, Neopositivismus bzw. als wissenschaftliche Philosophie (Carnap, Hans Reichenbach u.v.a.) [...] zweitens innerhalb der Sozialwissenschaften als Behaviorismus. Stammvater der Bewegung ist Charles Sanders Peirce, der Begriinder des Pragmatismus.10 Knopf himself does not pursue the implications which these comments have for investigations into Brecht's theoretical development, and the first critic to consider his relationship to 'Neopositivismus', or logical empiricism, in any detail was Herbert Claas in 1977.11 On the basis of his reading of Brecht's unpublished 'Notizbuch Nr.5 von 193I', Claas establishes that Brecht had a lively though not uncritical interest in the writings of such figures as Carnap, Reichenbach, and Neurath. Brecht also referred directly to Carnap's work in the then-unpublished essay 'tautologien der alten romanform'.12 Furthermore, Claas says that Brecht was an attentive reader at this time of Erkenntnis, the housejournal of the logical empiricists.13 Claas was unable to follow up this line of inquiry, as Brecht's own annotated copies of Erkenntnis were not available, and this area of Brecht scholarship lay dormant until Danneberg and 7 Hansjiirgen Rosenbauer, Brecht und der Behaviorismus (Bad Homburg: Gehlen), 1970. 8 Rosenbauer, pp. 37, 43-46. 9John J.

Danneberg and Muller also explicate one ofBrecht's 'Keuner' stories with reference to markings Brecht had made on articles by Schlick and Neurath in his copies of Erkenntnis.15 Clearly, a very strong case has been made for systematically investigating his interest in logical empiricism, but Danneberg and Muller also advance three rather more contentious theses. First, they contend that logical empiricism had a major impact on Brecht's philosophical ideas, and in particular on his concept of truth, though they also argue that his criterion of practicability is more stringent than the logical empiricist principle of verifiability. Second, they suggest that his reflections on behaviourism, and on causality in non-Aristotelian drama, must be related to logical empiricism. Third, they claim that logical empiricism influenced his conception of ethics, according to which 'there can be no such thing as absolute, eternally valid moral norms or ethical prescriptions'.16 The main difficulty with Danneberg's and Miiller's argument is that they conflate the distinction between pragmatism and logical empiricism.17 Ironically, the evi- dence which they produce in order to document Brecht's philosophical emphasis on practicability suggests that he was not so much a logical empiricist as a traditional pragmatist. As will be shown later, he does not share the logical empiricist view of ethics, which entails that science must be value-free. Indeed, although his conception of truth defers to the logical empiricist debunking of metaphysical assumptions, ultimately he espouses a position consistent with the pragmatism of Charles Sanders Peirce. As Danneberg and Muller themselves point out, the crux of the 'Keuner' story they analyse is the suggestion that a statement has significance only if it would affect our behaviour. This suggestion is not, however, equivalent to the logical empiricist view that the meaning of a statement turns on its experiential verifiability,18 and 14 Lutz Danneberg and Hans-Harald Muller, 'Wissenschaftliche Philosophie und literarischer Real- ismus.

The passage cited by Danneberg and Muller in order to substantiate their views on Brecht's understanding of causality seems to me implicitly to undermine the logical positivist contention that prediction and explanation are two sides of the same coin. Brecht writes: 'Zu diesen neuen Definitionen [der Kausalitat] gehort, daB wir weder Voraussagungen machen, wo wir keine machen k6nnen, noch alles Gebiet aufgeben, wo wir keine zuverlassigen Aussagen machen k6nnen' ('Die Kausalitat in nichtaristotelischer Dramatik' in Bertolt Brecht, Gesammelte Werke, 20vols (Frank- furt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1967-82), xv, 278-79). 17 A useful account of the relationship between positivism and pragmatism may be found in Kolakowski, Positivist Philosophy, pp. 18 -202. 18 'Brecht and Logical Positivism', pp. 15I, 154, 158-59. Interestingly enough, Brecht also questioned the logical empiricist tenet that metaphysical assertions are meaningless, in a marginal note to Rudolf Carnap's essay, 'Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache', Erkenntnis, 2.4 (1931), 219-4 (p. 238). For an alternative response to Carnap's essay, see Ayer, pp. 43-44.</page><page sequence="5">STEVE GILES seems in fact to presuppose Peirce's theory of meaning, according to which, 'what a thing means is simply what habits it involves. Now, the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead us to act [...] and there is no distinction of meaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice'.19 I now look in rather more detail at Brecht's relationship to logical empiricism as it developed in 1931, by analysing his responses to essays in Erkenntnis, in particular those by Otto Neurath.20 Brecht was particularly interested in two essays in Erkenntnis, I (1930), Neurath's 'Wege der wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung' and Philipp Frank's 'Was bedeuten die gegenwartigen physikalischen Theorien fur die allgemeine Erkenntnislehre?'.21 In the Neurath essay, Brecht marks the passages dealing with theological speculation cited by Danneberg and Muller, but the markings on Frank's essay are potentially even more interesting. Brecht notes Frank's recommendation of induction as the basis for scientific method (p. 157) and his experiential theory of truth (p. 135), but also marks two passages where Frank refers to the semiotic nature of science. According to Frank, science develops a procedure 'das geeignet ist, mit Hilfe eines geschicktgewahlten Zeichensystems Ordnung in unsere Erlebnisse zu bringen und dadurch uns ihre praktische Beherrschung zu erleichtern' (p. 134), and he goes on to make the more fundamental assertion that 'das System der Wissenschaft besteht aus Zeichen' (p. 141). In addition to confirming Claas's suggestion that Brecht at this time was interested in an integration of'sprachkritischer Erkenntnistheorie und materialistischer Dialek- tik',22 these marked passages also anticipate Frank's references to the leading American pragmatist William James's theory of truth. Like structuralist semio- ticians nowadays, James rejects the correspondence theory of truth, and argues instead (writes Frank) that the truth of a theoretical system consists in its pragmatic capacity, namely 'uns [...] im Leben, in unseren Erkenntnissen zurechtzufinden, auf sie [die Wirklichkeit] unseren Wiinschen gemaB3 erwirken zu konnen' (p. I37). Although Brecht was attracted toJames's pragmatism, he none the less dissented in dialectical fashion from the residual rationalism contained inJames's insistence that theoretical contradictions must be avoided: 'im gegenteil!', says Brecht (p. 138). 19 'How to Make Our Ideas Clear', in Charles Sanders Peirce, Collected Papers, 8 vols, ed. by Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1960), v, 248-71 (p. 257). This essay was first published in 1878 in Popular Science Monthly. Peirce's philosophical work is discussed in Kolakowski, Positivist Philosophy, pp. 182-88. 20 The Bertolt-Brecht-Archiv also holds a copy of Neurath's Empirische Soziologie. Der wissenschaftliche Gehalt der Geschichte und derNationalbkonomie (Vienna: Springer, 193 ). It seems likely that Brecht obtained this particular volume from Bernhard von Brentano in 1933. Brentano's name is written on the title-page, and the dating is confirmed by Brecht's letters to Margot von Brentano and Neurath, which were written by summer 1933 (see Bertolt Brecht, Briefe, ed. by Giinter Glaser, 2vols (Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1981), I, 163-64, I73-74). The volume contains various pencil markings, only some of which are attributable to Brecht. Certain key passages, where Neurath expresses a 'Brechtian' position, are not marked at all. For example, in his account of the principles of materialist sociology, Neurath refers to 'Gebardenvorgange, die an die Stelle des alten "BewufBtseins" treten' (p. 6o). He also argues that sociology must dispense with notions such as personality, empathy ('Einfuihlung'), and understanding ('Verstehen'), whose deployment would be based on a misplaced desire to single man out in the world of creation (pp.63-65); the parallel with the I931 version of Mann ist Mann is evident.

Neurath deals here with three main areas: the unitary science of physicalism, behaviourism in the human sciences, and Marxism. He begins by situating himself theoretically in relation to the anti-metaphysical stance of the Vienna Circle, and indicates that his own position, which abandons 'philosophy' and eschews Wittgenstein's notorious ladder, is more rigorously scientific (SP, pp. 534-36). Neurath advocates a unitary science, or 'Einheitswissenschaft', which construes the different scientific laws (for example, chemical, meteorological, sociological) involved in explaining and predicting particular events as parts of one system. This unitary science expresses everything in the unitary language of physics, which consists in observational statements grounded in experience: human perceptions and stimuli produced by external objects. Science is an internally consistent system of such statements, and new scientific assertions are validated not by comparing them with 'experiences' or with 'the world' but by confronting them with the existing totality of scientific statements.24 Neurath's physicalism leads him to reject the 'ghost in the machine' approach to social action, predicated on such arcane notions as the 'ego' or the 'personality', and he advocates instead a form of behaviourism. The unitary science of physicalism dismisses the hermeneutic tradition's distinction between 'Naturwissenschaften' and 'Geisteswissenschaften', because this distinction illegitimately postulates the existence of metaphysical substances behind observable processes. Furthermore, because only physicalist accounts of human behaviour can claim cognitive validity, Neurath contends that a scientific sociology must have no truck with ethics, and must embody the principles of social behaviourism, or 'Sozialbehaviorismus'. Social behaviourism infers law-like regularities from observed human behaviour in order to predict future events. It has no need to deploy Weberian or humanist notions such as understanding or empathy, and replaces the metaphysics of soul or spirit with the hard facts ofphysicalism. Accordingly, Neurath dismisses ethics as a metaphysical residue which has no place in a scientific sociology, because physi- calism renders normative ethics meaningless: 'Wenn man alle metaphysischen Elemente aus der Ethik beseitigt hat, sowie alle theologischen Physikalismen, dann bleiben nur entweder Aussagen uber bestimmte Verhaltungsweisen der Menschen oder ihre Befehle an andere Menschen fibrig' (SP, p. 552). Nevertheless, this does not mean that social behaviourism is simplistic or reductionist. In Neurath's view, it does not apply the existing laws of physics to human behaviour, but generates sociological laws based on observable events. Neurath thus rejects the entire enterprise of theoretical jurisprudence, as instanced in the work of Kelsen, on the grounds that a physicalist approach to law can involve only a sociology of specific societal phenomena (compare Brecht's approach to law in Der Dreigroschenprozefl). 23 Otto Neurath, 'Soziologie im Physikalismus', Erkenntnis, 2.5-6 (I 93), 393-44 For ease of reference I have cited this essay as reprinted in Otto Neurath, Gesammelte philosophische und methodologische Schriften (Vienna: [n.p.], 198 ), pp. 533-62. Further references are cited as SP. For confirmation that Brecht was aware of this essay in 193 , see the reference to his Notizbuch Nr. 5 von 193 in Claas, p. 5 1. 24 In so doing, Neurath implicitly rejects the logical empiricist definition of truth and meaning in terms of verification.</page><page sequence="7">STEVE GILES Neurath now considers the relationship between social behaviourism and more traditional approaches to sociological analysis. As far as classical sociological theory is concerned, Neurath argues that only Marx's later work provides a theoretical model consistent with the precepts of social behaviourism. Neurath elaborates on this point by presenting an extended critique of Weber's work on the Protestant ethos, and remarks elsewhere in his essay make it clear that his understanding of Marxist social theory is based on the 1859 'Vorwort' to Zur Kritik der politischen Okonomie, which plays down the role of individual consciousness and intentionality in sociological explanation: Wenn man weiB, welche soziale Gesamtbedingungen zu einer Zeit bestehen, kann man das Verhalten ganzer Gruppen weit eher voraussagen als die Argumente, welche die einzelnen nun fir ihr Tun vorbringen werden [...]. Diese meist metaphysisch formulierten 'Motiva- tionsgefechte' vermeidet eine empirische Soziologie, die auffruchtbare Arbeit aus ist, wie die heute erfolgreichste Soziologie: der Marxismus. (SP, p. 553) How did Brecht respond to Neurath's essay? He makes numerous pencil mark- ings (far more than on any other article in Erkenntnis), and two critical comments. The first concerns Neurath's emphasis on observation, and Brecht's response indicates his ambivalence towards the positivist tenet of phenomenalism in view of the philosophical implications of modern physics: "'betrachtung" bleibt, weil betrachtung, phanomenalistisch, also metaphysisch. wo bleibt selbsteinschaltung unter die [sic] determinierenden faktoren.'25 The second relates to Neurath's stress on the predictive nature of science, which Brecht reacts to in classic pragmatist fashion: 'zweck der voraussagen: das handeln'.26 Brecht's markings on Neurath's essay show that he was particularly interested in the following issues of philosophy and social theory: (i) the logical empiricist critique of metaphysics and its related linguistic demystifi- cation of ethics and theology; (ii) the need for sociology to describe human behaviour in physicalist terms, and thus dispense with entities such as the soul and procedures such as 'Einfiihlung'; (iii) the nature of scientific laws: Brecht notes Neurath's reference to Schlick's understanding of scientific laws as instructions ('Anweisungen') for obtaining predictions from observation statements, as well as Neurath's admission of the difficulties involved in applying scientific laws to higher-order animal behaviour: 'Oft freilich, wo man sich von der Erforschung der Makrogesetze viel erhoffte, genigen sie nicht: gewisse UnregelmaBigkeiten bleiben unberechenbar' (SP, p. 543); (iv) the relative autonomy of sociology from the physical sciences; (v) Neurath's attempt to integrate Marxism and social behaviourism, as exempli- fied in his emphasis on the primacy of the mode of production in sociological analysis, his critique of Weber, and his behaviourist vindication of Marxist methodology. 25 See Brecht's copy of Erkenntnis, p. 413. His interest in modern physics at this time is amply confirmed by the fact that he had personal copies of Max Planck, Positivismus und reale Aufienwelt (Leipzig: [n.p.], I93 ), and A. S. Eddington, Das Weltbild der Physik und ein Versuch seiner philosophischen Deutung (Braun- schweig: [n.p.], I93I ). The title page of Eddington is signed 'brecht 31' in red crayon, and Brecht marked and/or commented on various passages from its first three chapters. 26 Brecht's copy of Erkenntnis, p. 414. For an account of the logical empiricist view that science involves prediction and control, see Ayer, p. 50. 89</page><page sequence="8">90 Logical Empiricism and Social Behaviourism It is now appropriate to consider Brecht's theoretical writings from I93I to 1932 in the light of the above discussion. These writings clearly demonstrate the impact of logical empiricism on his thinking at the time, but also show that its influence was very much circumscribed by his existing philosophical pragmatism. This is even the case in Der DreigroschenprozeJ3, where his methodological commitment to social behaviourism sits rather uneasily with his views on value-free science and objective knowledge. The most explicit references to logical empiricism occur in the recently published essay 'Tautologien der alten Romanform', where, in addition to citing an essay in Erkenntnis by Carnap, Brecht echoes Neurath's critique of'Einfiihlung'.27 Further intriguing parallels with Neurath may be found in two newly published essays on acting, 'Darstellung des Schreckens' and 'Der Schauspieler'.28 In 'Darstellung des Schreckens', Brecht recommends a mode of acting which represents emotions not on the basis of introspection, but in terms of observation and external behaviour,29 while in 'Der Schauspieler' he insists that actors should not attempt to show meta- physical entities that transcend reality. At the same time, he is constantly aware of the practical context of aesthetic representations, as in 'Uber ein nicht-aristotelisches Romanschreiben', where he stresses the need for non-Aristotelian novels to deploy 'operative' sentences: 'Aussagen fiber Erscheinungen [. . .] welche Operationen mit diesen Erscheinungen gestalten, praktische Aussagen' (Schriften i, p. 54I). As indicated earlier, all these remarks must be placed in context with reference to Brecht's philosophical pragmatism. As early as I929, he had implied that truth is a question of praxis when he observed that truth must be discovered because it is generated by the changeability of persons or situations ('Wahrheit i', Schriften i, p. 360). Similarly, in his 1931 comments on Descartes, he argued that the truth or falsity of a statement is irrelevant unless it is related to action ('Zu Descartes "Betrachtungen" (Reclam)', in Schriften I, pp. 534-35), a sentiment echoed in 'Objektivismus und Materialismus bei Lenin' (Schriften I, p. 575) and clarified in 'Nutzen der Wahrheit': Es sollen [...] Methoden der Vorstellungskritik angewendet und neue Vorstellungen auf- gebaut werden, welche sich durch ihre Niitzlichkeit legitimieren [...], und der Nutzen soll bemessen werden an der unsere gesellschaftliche Welt umandernden Kraft. (Schriften i, pp. 58o-81 (p. 58 ) ).30 This pragmatist approach to truth also lies at the core of Brecht's epistemological reflections in Der Dreigroschenprozef,. At the same time, this particular text provides the clearest indication of the impact of Neurath's social behaviourism on Brechtian theory, and I address this issue first. One of the main pieces of evidence said to substantiate Brecht's behaviourist tendencies is, as Knopf observes in his Forschungs- bericht (FB, p. 88), a much-quoted passage from Der DreigroschenprozeJ3: 27 Schriften I, pp. 54I-42. The editors of Schriften i also suggest that 'Uber den aristotelischen Roman' (pp. 538-39) was influenced by Brecht's reading of Carnap, though in this case the evidence is less clear cut (see the discussion, p. 793). 28 Schriften I, pp. 394-95. The editors date these essays as 'Um 1930' (p. 75 ), but in view of my argument perhaps this dating should be revised. 29 Compare Neurath's suggestion that anger should be construed not in terms of individual conscious- ness, but with reference to behavioural differences (Neurath, Gesammelte ... Schriften, p. 546). 30 Despite the fact that its terminological closeness to Der Dreigroschenprozefi is quite apparent, the editors date this essay as 1932 (Schriften i, p. 807).</page><page sequence="9">STEVE GILES 91 Der Behaviorismus ist eine Psychologie, die von den Bediirfnissen der Warenproduktion ausgeht, Methoden in die Hand zu bekommen, mit denen man den Kaufer beeinflussen kann, also eine aktive Psychologie, fortschrittlich und revolutionierend katexochen. Sie hat, ihrer kapitalistischen Funktion entsprechend, Grenzen (die Reflexe sind biologische, nur in einigen Chaplinfilmen sind sie schon sozial). Der Weg geht auch hier nur uber die Leiche des Kapitalismus, aber dies ist auch hier ein guter Weg. (DGP, p. 478) Surprisingly enough, Knopf argues that this passage does not so much confirm Brecht's behaviourism as present a scathing Marxist critique of behaviourism: Indem Brecht den Behaviorismus als Ausdruck des Kapitalismus beschreibt, prangert er ihn mit diesem zusammen im 'Dreigroschenprozef3' an als zu Uberwindendes. DaB Brecht sich deshalb ihm auch verpflichtet hatte (und das heift dem Kapitalismus ebenfalls) - zur Zeit der 'Mafnahme' - hat die Forschung erst noch zu beweisen. (FB, p. 89) While Knopf's point is well taken if we restrict our attention to behaviourist psychology, a more positive attitude towards behaviourism is also apparent in this passage. Although Brecht writes of stepping over the corpse of capitalism, he construes this as a necessary action, and even describes behaviourist psychology as quintessentially progressive and revolutionary: 'fortschrittlich und revolutionierend katexochen'. Furthermore, his attraction to a socological variant of behaviourism is very much in evidence in key passages in Der DreigroschenprozeJf which present his views on progressive art and social scientific methodology. Brecht's discussion of behaviourist psychology is located towards the end of an extended critique of aesthetic humanism, subtitled 'Im Film mu3 das Menschliche eine Rolle spielen' (DGP, pp. 476-78). The nub of his argument is that under advanced capitalism, the presuppositions of aesthetic humanism, as embodied for example in the bourgeois novel, have been destroyed. The novel was grounded in an introspective psychology based on anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism, whereas film concentrates on external action and embodies the principles of non-Aristotelian art forms. As such, film rejects empathy and mimesis, and pro- vokes the spectator/viewer into establishing causal connections between the politi- cally situated behaviour patterns of its characters. Whatever reservations Brecht may have harboured regarding the capitalist dimension of behaviourist psychology, there can be no doubt that the precepts of social behaviourism inform his account of progressive art both here and elsewhere in Der DreigroschenprozeJ3. In an earlier discussion of film and the bourgeois novel, for example, he finds film's treatment of character to be particularly instructive. Characters in films are, he argues, simply types, who are put into specific situations and therefore take on particular attitudes, rather than being individuals motivated by a rich inner life or substance. He implicitly rejects the dialectic of inner self and outward action at the core of Hegelian aesthetics,31 and advocates instead a theory of the subject analogous to Neurath's. Furthermore, although film eschews the expressive assumptions built into bourgeois art (film is a medium 'der auch niemandem gestattet, sich (und nichts sonst) durch ein Werk auszudriicken, und keinem Werk, eine Person auszudriicken' (DGP, p. 465)) it has the considerable advantage that it can provide practical knowledge by virtue of its inductive method, and thereby bring art into the realm of social science. 31 For further discussion of this aspect of Hegelian aesthetics in relation to modern drama, see my book The Problem of Action in Modern European Drama (Stuttgart: Heinz, I98I). Brecht himself had a personal copy oftheJubiliumsausgabe of Hegel's works which was edited by Hermann Glockner from 1927 onwards.</page><page sequence="10">92 Logical Empiricism and Social Behaviourism The scientific nature of the enterprise which Brecht takes himself to be engaging in throughout Der DreigroschenprozeJ3 is indicated by the work's subtitle, 'Ein soziologisches Experiment'. He wishes to investigate bourgeois culture by deriving the ideas ('Vorstellungen') which constitute it from the observable behaviour of public institutions such as the law courts, the press, and the film industry. He uses the verb 'abziehen' to characterize his procedure ('Diese Vorstellungen, abgezogen dem Verhalten offentlicher Institutionen' (DGP, p. 448, my italics)), one meaning of which is to produce a photographic print from a negative.32 This is the first of a series of metaphors emphasizing the need for Brecht's sociological experiment to make social realities visible, 'um das zu Sehende jedermann sichtbar zu machen' (DGP, p. 449). In the section subtitled 'Von der Spekulation zum Experiment', he refers to the possibility of producing a plastic image of societal processes (DGP, p. 459), writes again of the importance of visibility, and underlines his aim of making legal procedures clearly perceptible so as to produce a copy of actuality: Die vorauszusehenden Versuche der Justiz, Vernunft anzunehmen, hatten wir nicht zu vereiteln. Wir hatten fallen zu lassen, was fiel, aber den Vorgang wom6glich so zu veranstal- ten, daB er [...] deutlich wahrzunehmen war [...] der Proze3 muBte ein Abbild der Wirklichkeit werden, etwas ilber sie aussagen. (DGP, p. 460) The social behaviourist dimension of Der DreigroschenprozeJ3 is developed further in Brecht's account of the appropriate experimental method for analysing the cultural tastes of cinema-goers: Allerdings miiBte man zu diesem Zweck unbedingt experimentell vorgehen, also in Zusammenarbeit mit bestimmten Kinos, die besonders kleinbiirgerliche Besucherschaft und darin wieder spezifierte oder proletarische usw. haben, bestimmte Filme vorfiihren und die Reaktionen durch geeignete MaBnahmen erfassen. Die gewonnenen Gesetze mii3ten ferner unbedingt dem Anspruch der Propheziebarkeit geniigen, das heiBt, so gefaBt sein, daB die Industrie sich daran halten kann, also ohne absolute Wertung. (DGP, p. 473) These proposals read like a textbook application of Neurath's social scientific methodology, with their emphasis on identifying behavioural responses, and deriving laws from them with a view to predicting future audience reactions. At the same time, it should be noted that Brecht's methodological position as expressed in Der Dreigroschenprozefi is not unequivocally behaviourist. Although he is sceptical of deductive explanation, and insists that the facts must be the bedrock of any valid theory, he states none the less, very much in the philosophical tradition of the early Marx as characterized by Kolakowski, that the facts themselves must be actively formed: 'Es liegen in jedem deduktiven Verfahren riesige Gefahren. Selbst die Induktion darf sich nicht anders als widerstrebend von den Fakten 16sen, und vor allem mussen die Fakten selber tatig gebildet werden und stindig die Theorie kritisieren k6nnen' (DGP, p. 5 I o). This implies that facts may not be the immediate givens which logical empiricists would like them to be, a point which Brecht clarifies in the opening sentence of the subsection 'Uber die Veranstaltung soziologischer 32 Interestingly enough, this methodological precept is consistent with Neurath's suggestion that a materialist sociology 'kennt nur dies Verhalten der Menschen, das man wissenschaftlich beobachten, "photographieren" kann' (Neurath, Empirische Soziologie, p. 63). At the same time, it also flatly contra- dicts Brecht's views on the aesthetic mediation of capitalist social reality as expressed in the famous passage dealing with the problematics of photography with reference to Krupp and AEG (DGP, p. 469). For further discussion, see my article 'Post/Structuralist Brecht? Representation and Subjectivity in Der Dreigroschenprozefi', The Other Brecht: The Brecht Yearbook, 7 (1992), I47-63 (pp. 150-53).</page><page sequence="11">STEVE GILES 93 Experimente'. He observes that a sociological experiment must provoke contra- dictions which are immanent in society, so as to make them perceptible. The material thus produced is alive, and not simply an object of contemplation, just as the viewer is inextricably located within social processes (DGP, p. 51o). This latter condition also applies to the instigators/organizers ('Veranstalter') of sociological experiments, who themselves occupy a position in the force-field of contradictory social interests. Because of this, they cannot avoid adopting a subjective, partisan viewpoint (DGP, pp. 512-I 3). This factor means that sociological experimentation is fundamentally different from those methods of investigation which presuppose that the investigator's position is objective and disinterested, not least when ideological critique is on the agenda: 'Um nun der standig funktionierenden Wirklichkeit [...] ihre Vorstellungen abzulisten, sind andere Methoden als die der "objektiven, interesselosen", passiven Anschauung m6glich' (DGP, pp. 448-49). Clearly, Brecht rejects out of hand the demand that sociology be value-free, but it is also vitally important to note that he does not draw the logical empiricist conclusion that a politically committed sociology must for that reason be unscientific. Indeed, he argues that in an antagonistic societal formation, the notion of an 'objective' standpoint is in any case an epistemological absurdity: 'Nur das beteiligte, mittatige Subjekt vermag hier zu "erkennen"' (DGP, p. 513). In addition to short-circuiting the positivist gap between knowledge and interests, he insists on the practical dimension in the very production of conceptual knowledge: 'Das Begreifen des soziologischen Experiments ist ein "Griffe finden". Es kommt nicht aufGrund eines Anschauungsaktes zustande, es endet nicht mit dem Zustandekommen einer Anschauung. Hier soll Erfahrung die Grundlage der Handhabung abgeben' (DGP, p. 53).33 As far as Brecht is concerned, the pure, contemplative, knowing subject is an idealist illusion. Perception collapses into praxis, just as critical epistemology from Kant to the Vienna Circle is to be superseded by Brecht's Marxist variant of traditional pragmatism.34 UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM STEVE GILES 33 See also Brecht's comment on definitions in this section, which sidesteps the logical positivist argument that cognitively valid definitions may only be lexical or stipulative: 'Alle Definitionen nun, die den apparatfeindlichen Kunstbegriff enthalten, machen ihren jeweiligen Stoff nicht handlich, sondern entfernen die "Kunst" vonjedem Zugriffund bezeichnen sich selber als folgenlos. Es kommt aber darauf an, Definitionen aufzustellen, welche die Handhabung des Stoffes erm6glichen' (DGP, p. 512). 34 I gratefully acknowledge the generous assistance given to me by the Bertolt-Brecht-Archiv in preparing this article, in particular the invaluable service of providing transcripts of Brecht's annotations to his personal copies of books and periodicals, and furthermore wish to thank the Bertolt-Brecht-Archiv for permission to cite Brecht's annotations to Erkenntnis. I am also grateful to Rodney Livingstone for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of this article.</page></plain_text>
