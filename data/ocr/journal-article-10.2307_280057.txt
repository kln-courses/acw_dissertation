<plain_text><page sequence="1">RCeports AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PICTOGRAPHS AT LA PENA PINTADA, JALISCO, MEXICO Joseph B. Mountjoy A recently discovered sheltered rock scar covered with red pictographs, in Jalisco, west Mexico, is a major addition to the rather meager data on pictographs in Mesoamerica. It appears to contain a complex set of data pertaining to the cosmology of the relatively unknown Indians who inhabited the Jalisco coast during the last Pre-Hispanic period. Analysis of the scar has incorporated both the artistic symbolism of the nearby Huichol Indians, and concepts developed through archaeoastronomy. This analysis suggests that the ceiling pic- tographs record the use of sky transits of the sun, Venus, or the constellation Orion as wet-season/dry-season calendrical markers. Wall pictographs show the sun on the mountainous horizon, below which is the earth filled with symbols of plants and animals; among these stand shamans calling down the life-giving rain from the god(s) of the sky. I also explore the possibility that one of the ceiling pictographs is a record of the appearance of the Crab supernova in the sky in A.D. 1054. THE LA PENA PINTADA SITE The La Pefia Pintada Site was the only location with rock paintings out of 165 archaeological sites found along the Tomatlan river during three field seasons of investigations, 1975-1977 (Figure 1 and Figure 2, site 12). The site is situated on the west side of the Tomatlan river approx- imately 45 km from the Pacific Coast, 180 m above sea level and 20006'60" latitude by 105?02'43" longitude. The paintings are located on the back wall and the ceiling of a sheltered rock scar perched 40 m above the riverbed and opening North 45 ? East across the river (Figure 3). The site is surrounded on all sides for kilometers by a mass of granite bedrock. The boulder with the protected scar is composed of dark-stained granite and must weigh several hundred tons. It is perched atop a sheer stained-granite cliff, right on the edge of the cliff, overlooking boulders and deep pools of water smoothly sculpted out of the white granite rock in the river channel below. The rock scar appears to have been formed through some accident of nature which caused one or more large pieces of the boulder on the eastern underside to fall away and break up on the boulders of the riverbed below. The natural agent for this process is assumed to have been water entering fissures along the top of the boulder, and this exfoliation exposed a fresh white granite surface which contrasts with the dark stain of the older surfaces. At the location of the pictograph site the Tomatlan river is only 20 km or so from its headwaters and flows through a narrow channel with only small strips and patches of alluvial soil along its margins. By far the best view of the surrounding area is from the top of the boulder, several meters higher than the painted scar; from here there is a relatively unobstructed view of the horizon and the river channel to the north and south. However, even from within the rock scar Joseph B.

The entire eastern side of the boulder, where the painted scar is located, measures approx- imately 14 m long by 6 m high. However, the painted portion of the back wall of the scar itself (Figure 4) is 9.2 m long by 2.0 m high, and the painted area of the rock scar ceiling about 4.6 by 1.5 m. All the paint is in varying shades of red, the degree of lightness or darkness apparently depend- ing at least in part on the original thickness of application. In four locations on the back wall panel (Figure 4, D &amp; E-14, D &amp; E-16, D-17, D &amp; E-19) there are anthropomorphic stick figures with up- turned arms which have been pecked into the granite surface through the red pictographs. These four petroglyphs are indicated in Figure 4 by a dark fine-line outlining of the figures (Figure 5:A). These are the only nonpictograph designs observed. Considerable damage to the pictographs has occurred, especially on the left-hand section of the back wall. A local farmer attributed this to vandalism by some children who, he claimed, beat on the pictographs with rocks. On the other hand, I suspect a good deal of this damage may be attributable to natural spalling of the granite surface. As for the type of paint used, a small sample has been submitted to chemist Luis Torres at the Institute of Anthropological Research at the Mexican National University. He has not yet com- pleted his study but reports that it is most likely formed from a mineral oxide mixed into some sort of oily binder. Carl Lumholtz (1900:24-25) found that the nearby Huichol Indians of modern times made red paint either from a ferruginous clay which is ground on a metate and mixed with copal, or by grinding brazilwood on a metate and mixing it with lime and water. Whatever the composi- tion of the pictograph paint, it has stained the granite so well that we found it impossible to rub off any of the pigment, even using water. Judging from the width of most design elements on the back wall, it seems likely that fingers dipped into red paint were used directly for executing most of the designs. On the ceiling, however, the Indians may have used a fiber brush attached to a long stick to paint the big figures (Figure 4). This inference is based partly on the much greater width of the lines, and partly on the observation that there appears to have been no other way to have reached 111</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 2. Map of the archaeological sites studied in the area of the Cajon de Peia dam basin near Tomatlan, Jalisco, showing the location of the La Pefia Pintada pictograph site. the ceiling to paint these figures since the ceiling is at minimum more than 2 m above the narrow sloping ledgelike floor, and most of the figures are on the portion which extends beyond the small footing ledge. I visited the La Pefia Pintada pictograph site several times in the course of my three seasons of salvage archaeology in the Tomatlan river basin. The first time was in the spring of 1975 during a brief initial reconnaissance of sites in the Tomatlan river valley. At that time I took a few 35 mm color slide photographs of the paintings from the top of a tree growing at the base of the cliff and also used a telephoto camera attachment set on a tripod located on a boulder along the riverbank. Unfortunately, these photos proved to be inadequate, so I made two more trips to the site in the spring of 1976. This time, utilizing a new 260 mm telephoto camera lens, I took color print, black- and-white and color slide photographs from the top of a boulder at the base of the cliff. Further- more, I crept out onto the narrow ledge in front of the pictographs and systematically, albeit ner- vously, took overlapping color slide photographs of the back wall and the ceiling. At the time I sketched the 100 most distinct pictographs and measured some to enable reconstruction of the paintings to scale in the laboratory. During the 1977 field season I obtained the sample of paint which has been submitted for analysis. 112 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS &gt; F7' Figure 3. Photograph of the La Peia Pintada rock scar situated at the top of a cliff overlooking the Tomatlan River below. During the summer of 1978 the pictograph panel was reconstructed in the archaeology laboratory at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. First, a photo enlargement measuring 51 cm by 34 cm was made from one of the 35-mm black-and-white photo negatives. This was used as the master photo over which tracing paper was laid. Then, 24-cm by 18-cm color prints were made of the overlapping color slides, using the Cibachrome color print process. The individual pictograph designs were then traced, either directly from the master photograph, when distinct enough, or by using the color prints as an aid. In all cases care was taken to guard against inter- pretive reconstruction. The only cases where some interpretation was applied was whenever small breaks due to spalling or vandalism had interrupted a clearly continuous painted line. On the other hand, there is a general redness to many areas of the panel where designs are not clear- ly distinguishable, somewhat similar to the effect of chalk smudges left on a blackboard even after a thorough erasing with a cloth pad. This may be a residue of some earlier designs, now fad- ed and indistinct, under clearer later paintings. No attempt has been made in the drawing (Figure 4) to indicate this background coloration in the areas where it can be seen. CULTURAL AFFILIATION AND DATE OF THE PICTOGRAPHS The archaeological sites studied in the upper portion of the Tomatlan river basin (Figure 2, sites 14-69) were investigated for the purpose of salvaging information about the Pre-Hispanic occupa- tion of the area before the archaeological sites were flooded by the lake to be formed behind the Cajon de Penia dam, constructed just downstream from the village of Santiago. Of the 65 sites recorded in the area of the dam basin, only one (Figure 2, site 27) yielded surface-collected ar- tifact material solely attributable to an occupation antedating the Postclassic, even though in the lower Tomatlan river valley closer to the Pacific Coast there are several sites with considerable Classic and Preclassic remains.

These sites exhibit a remarkably uniform pattern in both location and internal construction. They contain from one to thirteen circular house foundations that open onto one or more plazas which have been leveled from the slope of a hillside or hilltop overlooking the Tomatlan river or one of its tributary arroyos. These hamlets are usually placed overlooking a low-lying patch of alluvial land suitable for small-scale irrigation agriculture. The sites from which artifacts were collected yielded considerable quantities of woodworking and food processing tools, as well as late Postclassic pottery sherds. Further supporting a Postclassic date is the fact that many of these sites are closely associated with some of the 134 petroglyph rocks which have been found in the immediate area of the dam basin. Some of these petroglyphs were discovered on rocks near the habitation sites, but in several cases they were on rocks actually within the habitation areas-even in one instance (Figure 2, site 53) forming part of the foundation of a house. It is doubtful that many West Mexico petroglyphs can be attributed to a period earlier than A.D. 900, and most are believed to date somewhat later (Mountjoy 1974). At one of these dam basin sites (Figure 2, site 24) the floors of all seven houses around one plaza were excavated and the plaza cross-trenched. One other house floor was excavated out of a group of four houses around the other plaza at the same site, and a ninth house floor was excavated at a different site (Figure 2, site 31). Much late Postclassic pottery was recovered from these excava- tions, as well as many copper artifacts, some of which were cast. Their presence also supports a Postclassic date for the occupation. Carbon from an artifact-filled pit in one of the house floors at site 24 gave a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1130 ? 120 (UCR 494), which appears quite acceptable. Another radiocarbon date was obtained from some carbon from a hearth in the associated plaza. It was A.D. 1620 -+ 130 (UCR 367). This second date is later than expected and may be due to some reutilization of the site during the early Spanish contact period. In the process of studying the La Penia Pintada pictograph site, I searched in the general area 115</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY for habitation sites where the people responsible for the pictographs might have lived. Three sites (Figure 2, sites 68-70) were found a short distance upstream on some low hills overlooking a branch of the Tomatlan river. Two were habitation sites. One site had three circular stone house foundations associated with grinding stones and adzes, and the other had a single circular house foundation. No pottery sherds were recovered from either site. The third site was a large boulder with petroglyphs found down at the river bank. What little is known about these sites would af- filiate them with the similar late Postclassic sites downstream. Furthermore, it is important to note that some, although by no means all, of the pictograph designs are similar to some of the petroglyph designs found on the 742 petroglyph rocks, most presumably of Postclassic date, which we have thus far located in the Tomatlan river valley. This is especially true of the anthropomor- phic stick figure designs. PICTOGRAPH SYMBOLISM AND ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALOGY If it can be assumed that the pictographs at La Pefia Pintada were painted by the Indians who inhabited the Tomatlan river valley during the Postclassic period at some time prior to the arrival of the Spanish, is there any way to discover what their meaning was to the native Indian popula- tion? One avenue of pictograph interpretation which has been used by Campbell Grant (1965) and others with some success is ethnographic analogy, the attempt to interpret the painted designs in the light of the culture of Indians living in that area at the time of European documentation. Such an approach is of greatest utility when there exists a reasonably full ethnographic record of the Indian culture and a good reason to believe that those Indians executed the pictographs, as ap- pears to have been the case with the southern California Chumash rock paintings. In the Tomatlan area of West Mexico however, there is no such good fortune. For the entire coast of Jalisco, ethnographic data of indisputable validity for the contact period Indian culture are scanty at best. Very little information was recorded regarding their material culture and domestic habits, let alone their religion. An early account by Fray Francisco de Lorenzo (cited by Mariano de Torres 1965:58-59) indicates that the coastal Indians living 50 km to the northwest of the Tomatlan river in A.D. 1530 worshipped many idols, some of clay and others of combustible material, perhaps wood, and that the sun was their supreme deity. Some distance to the south, perhaps within or near the Tomatlan river valley, Fray Francisco de Lorenzo (cited by Mariano de Torres 1965:60) convinced the local Indians to burn their pagan temples, along with the idols within them. He recorded that one of these temples was dedicated to the god of war, depicted as a thin and repugnant (at least to Fray Francisco) person with an arrow in one hand. Another temple, with an equally ugly idol, was dedicated to the god of fishing, who had a fish as his insignia. By A.D. 1650, disease, along with other factors, had severely depleted the indigenous coastal population. This, combined with the dominant influence of Spanish culture, left little of the in- digenous culture available for study in later years. Lacking the necessary ethnographic record of local Indian culture from which to extract religious analogies for pictograph interpretation, we are forced to turn to some other nearby In- dian culture. The best candidate is that of the Huichol Indians. The modern Huichol number some 8,000 to 10,000 Indians living in and around five major communities on the southern end of the Sierra Madre Occidental in northern Jalisco and eastern Nayarit (Figure 1). Huichol artistic sym- bolism has already been used with some success to interpret petroglyphic rock art in Nayarit (Mountjoy 1974; Furst and Scott 1975), and Huichol culture provides the best available model for ethnographic analogy in the Tomatlan, Jalisco, area for several good reasons. The first of these is geographical proximity. Even though the modern Huichol communities are rugged mountain refuges in which their territorial distribution is shrinking, these Indians ap- parently occupied a larger area in early Spanish contact times and might have covered a still larger area at some time prior to the Spanish conquest. The southern border of the area they now occupy is approximately 175 km to the northeast of the La Pefia Pintada pictograph site (Grimes and Hinton 1969), but one of the sacred places at which the Huichol frequently visited and left of- 116 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="8">REPORTS ferings around the turn of the century was a lagoon dedicated to Mother South Water near Talpa, Jalisco (Lumholtz 1900:14), only 55 km to the northeast of the pictograph site. Secondly, the Huichol are one of the least acculturated Indian groups in Mexico; subdued as late as 1722, they have since managed to preserve much of their Pre-Hispanic religious beliefs and associated rites (Grimes and Hinton 1969). The emphasis they place on shamanistic rites is at- tested to by the name they call themselves, Visha'lika or Vira'rika meaning curers, healers, or prophets (Lumholtz 1900:5; 1902[II]:21), and further, a large proportion of the men consider themselves to be either singing shamans or curing shamans. Third, the Huichol were the subject of a masterful and pioneering study of religious symbolism by the Norwegian ethnographer Carl Lumholtz. His fieldwork among the Huichol was done in the late 1890s and published in diary form in 1902 (Lumholtz 1902). His major works dealing specifically with Huichol symbolism were published in Symbolism of the Huichol Indians (1900) and Decorative Art of the Huichol Indians (1904). At the time of his research anthropologists were quite interested in the relation between primitive art and its cultural context. For example, A. L. Kroeber (1901), George Wissler (1902), and Franz Boas (1903) were all involved in studies of decorative art and artistic symbolism of North Amerian Indians. Even against such scholarly com- petition Lumholtz's work has been judged of outstanding quality. Robert Zingg, who did a re-study of the Huichol based on Lumholtz's earlier work, calls the study of artistic symbolism by Lumholtz "the best and most significant work in the 'expressionistic' element of primitive art" (Zingg 1938:563). Even though Huichol artistic symbolism provides the best available model for interpreting the pictographs at La Penia Pintada, the use of this model has some shortcomings. There is no good evidence to suggest an unbroken cultural development between the Tomatlan valley Postclassic sites and Huichol culture of the historic period. In fact, there is so little ethnographic data on the Tomatlan valley Indians at the time of European contact that it is impossible to determine much regarding their degree of affiliation with the nearby Huichol, although no available ethnographical or archaeological information suggests the conclusion that they were markedly dissimilar. It is likely that the culture of the Tomatlan area Indians was similar to that of the Huichol, but it may have been influenced by the Nahuatized Indians of southeastern Jalisco, who at Spanish Conquest times and in the Pre-Hispanic period are known to have had a religion rather closely related to that of central Mexican peoples such as the Aztec (Schondube 1974). It is, however, not beyond possibility that the pictographs at La Penia Pintada were painted by the Pre- Hispanic ancestors of the Indians identified as the Huichol-Tecual in the 1580s (Sauer 1934:7-10); very little is known about the extent of their Pre-Hispanic geographical distribution. Granted these uncertainties, in this attempt to interpret the symbolism of the La Penia Pintada pictographs the primary question will be how to understand them in the light of Huichol artistic symbolism. But it must also be kept in mind that some elements may not be decipherable through this means, and that other sources of ethnographic analogy may be necessary and appropriate. It may also be possible to offer original interpretations which are not directly derivable from analogies to the ethnographic record of Hispanic period Indian culture. Observations made by Lumholtz and by Zingg suggest some problems which may present themselves during an attempt to apply Huichol symbolism to the interpretation of the La Penia Pin- tada pictographs. Lumholtz (1902[II]:213-219) discovered that although Huichol designs were never executed out of pure fancy and never lacked symbolic meaning within the context of their culture, hardly any two design patterns are exactly alike. Indeed, he found some men unable to in- terpret the designs woven by a woman into a man's belt, and even a woman unable to interpret the designs woven by another woman. Design symbolism was something of a religious specializa- tion of the shamans, though the designs were used for decorative purposes by everyone and usual- ly understood in at least a general way. Zingg (1938:574) found that some Huichol informants could say very little about the designs on the interior of votive bowls, whereas a certain shaman might hold the bowl in his hands and recount a long myth as if reading from the designs. On the other hand, like Lumholtz he found a general understanding of the symbolism to be common 117</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY among all Huichols, and that specific interpretations "varied within the narrow confines of the mythological structure of the tribe" (1938:575). However, Zingg personally confessed that the symbolism "is so highly complicated, mystical, and obscure that my knowledge of Huichol culture is still inadequate to interpret it all" (1938:575). It therefore seems unwise to always expect a close correlation between the Pre-Hispanic pictograph designs and modern Huichol symbolism, and to require that all pictographs be interpretable on the basis of the available ethnographic studies. ANALYSIS OF THE PICTOGRAPHS AT LA PENA PINTADA In the following analysis of the different types of designs painted on the back wall and ceiling of the La Pefia Pintada rock scar, the location of specific designs under discussion will be indicated by the point of conjunction between lettered coordinates along the left-hand margin of Figure 4 and numbered coordinates along the bottom margin of Figure 4. For further clarification one may consult Figure 5. This contains examples of most of the designs utilized in the analysis, listed in the order of discussion in the text. There are many different designs on the back wall of the painted rock scar (Figure 4), but by far the most common is the vertical undulating line, frequently found in sets (Figure 5:B; Figure 4: for example, E-2, D-9 &amp; 10, E-13, F-24). There is abundant evidence that the Huichol would inter- pret these as rain. Lumholtz (1900:20) notes that parallel vertical straight lines indicate falling rain, and zig-zag lines the idea of rain serpents. This is rooted in the belief that "springs are sacred, and the gods in them are mothers, or serpents, that rise with the clouds and descend as fructifying rain" (Lumholtz 1902[II]:57). This symbolism of the water snake permeates Huichol cosmology: most of the gods and all of the goddesses are believed to be serpents; so are the pools of water and the springs in which the deities live, and even the staffs of the gods; these last however, are also considered as arrows. In the sky, in the wind sweeping through the grass, the moving sea, the sinuous flowing rivers, the darting lightning, the descending rain; in fire, smoke, clouds; in fact in all natural phenomena,-these In- dians see serpents [Lumholtz 1900:211]. When such designs are painted on the face of a peyote seeker (in yellow, the color of fire) they may signify a rainstorm. Occasionally, in these facial paintings rain serpents are shown as pen- dant from the area of the eyes, and in at least one case are shown falling on dots which symbolize maize kernels. Water, as it relates to fertility of the earth, is foremost in the Huichol mind: The moving principle in the religion of the Huichols is the desire of producing rain, and thus of successfully raising corn, their principal food. I take this to be common to most of the agricultural tribes of this continent. Water first, and water last, is the consideration in all their ceremonies, the centre of their thoughts [Lumholtz 1900:22]. In one case the water serpent design occurs as streaks on a disc dedicated to Grandfather Fire-i.e., as tear streaks on his face. This is also the case on one stone figure of Elder Brother, and Lumholtz (1902[II]:198) recorded: "When a deer is brought in, one of the sons takes a little deer-blood in his hands, dips a stick into it, and paints five lines (rain symbols) down the right cheek of his Father." Rivers, as indicated above, may be depicted by zig-zag lines and thought of as snakes which slither over the countryside. Sometimes the zig-zag lines also symbolize lightning, and if horizontal they signify the wind (serpents flying through the air) or the earth on which the gods walk. In four or more cases in the pictographs (Figure 4:E &amp; F-11, E-11 &amp; 12, D-12, G-22) tear streaks as water serpents are shown flowing from what appear to be eye symbols (Figure 5:C), and in at least two cases (Figure 4: C &amp; D-18, E-18) pouring forth from the mouth of Tlaloc (cen- tral Mexican rain god) faces (Figure 5:D). Both concentric circles and diamond shapes commonly represent eyes among the Huichol. This is based on the concept of the power of seeing and understanding unknown things and expresses 118 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="10">REPORTS the prayer that the eye of the god notice the supplicant and grant his wishes. Lumholtz's research indicates that this design is found on the frontshields of the gods, in yarn work, and in votive bowls. Some additional depictions of eyes (Figure 5:E) are found on the back wall of the rock scar (Figure 4) at locations C-15, E-14, E &amp; F-14, C &amp; D-22, and G-5 &amp; 6. Lumholtz (1904:137) also found that an irregular circle having a cross within (Figure 4:G-20, G-23) was sometimes used to signify the eye of a god or the face of Father Sun. Lumholtz (1900) recorded the frequent use of dots to indicate maize kernels, ears of maize, squash or beans, as well as raindrops and stars on occasion. Perhaps the clump of tiny circles or the dots within circles (Figure 5:F, Figure 4:D-18, D-23) can be interpreted as maize, beans, or squash, although markings on plumage is also a possibility for D-23. The cross-hatched design (Figure 5:G; Figure 4:E-7 &amp; 8, E-15 &amp; 16, E-25) may indicate maize stalks with ears, or heaps of maize at harvest time; when used as a design on the fae of a peyote seeker it may represent the flower bed of Corn Mother or the backshield or bead of Grandfather Fire (Lumholtz 1904:plate xix). This design may also represent deer tripe when there are dots interspersed between the lines (Lumholtz 1900:302). Also related to the growth of crops, specifically maize, is the white five-petal toto flower. This is ritually associated with maize because it also grows during the wet season (Lumholtz 1902[II]:229), and at least in modern times has been found to be commonly used by the Huichol as a symbol for peyote (Eger and Collings 1978:39). In nature, the toto flower has five petals, the sacred number of the Huichol, but the Indians usually picture it in their art with four petals, possibly because the symmetrical form is easier to execute in some media such as textiles. Lumholtz (1904:319) shows 20 toto designs, the great majority of which have a basic four-petal pattern. This symbol (Figure 5:H) can be found at three locations in the pictograph panel (Figure 4:H-5, C-15, D-15 &amp; 16). Another design symbolically associated with maize is the spotted black fish (Figure 5:1; Figure 4:E-8 &amp; 9). Green corn is called "black fish," and "ears of corn are depicted ... by the painting of a fish, which is called by the Mexicans bagre" (Lumholtz 1900:214). The intertwined lines in the pictograph designs (Figure 5:J; Figure 4:E &amp; F-7, E &amp; F-18, E-G-23 &amp; 24, F-26) were found by Lumholtz (1900:41, 126; 1904:plate xx, 291) to signify the root of the squash vine, the criss-crossing water gourd vine, the bean plant, or the double gourd. The double gourd is esteemed as medicine and used by peyote seekers to drink from as well as to carry home sacred water. Lumholtz (1904:281) found that "the magic double water-gourd, even its most con- ventionalized form, means a prayer for water, the source of all life and health." Another design which may have agricultural significance is the heart-shaped or apple-shaped symbol with a stem (Figure 5:K; Figure 4:F-20, F &amp; G-20 &amp; 21, D &amp; E-22). Although I was unable to find this design among those recorded by Lumholtz, Ramon Mata Torres (1973:83) shows a similar design, dedicated to the Huichol goddess of creation, which is painted on the face when it is time to begin preparing the fields for planting in April. A pictograph figure which is rather common on the back wall of the rock scar is a sort of two- edged vertical serrated design (Figure 5:L; Figure 4:F &amp; G-6-7, E &amp; F-8-9, F &amp; G-9, D &amp; E-13, F-14, D-20 &amp; 21, E &amp; F20-21, F &amp; G-22, F-23). The most probable association of this design is with the notched deer bone. The deer is the emblem of sustenance and fertility to the Huichols. In their myths maize was once a deer, and the deer antler was the original peyote (Lumholtz 1900:23, 1902[II]:45). Thus to the Huichols maize, deer, and peyote are intimately associated. Lumholtz (1900:23) expresses the association in this way: Peyote is the special drinking-bowl of the god of fire and "the Huichols have to bring it to him every year, or they would be unable to catch deer: consequently it would not rain and they would have no corn." Lumholtz (1900:205) provides an il- lustration of a stick of brazilwood which is flat and notched over the upper half of its length on both edges. The lower nonnotched part serves as a handle. This stick "symbolizes the notched deer-bone (metatarsal) against which the shoulder blade of the deer is rubbed to produce a rattl- ing accompaniment to the hunting song. The noise is supposed to be specially efficacious in decoy- ing the deer into the snare: hence a symbolic stick like this is deposited for luck in killing deer" 119</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Lumholtz 1900:205). This same serrated design is pictured in Lumholtz's 1904 monograph (1904:297). Among the other pictographs on the back wall can be found eight figures which may represent shamans (Figure 5:M; Figure 4:D &amp; E-6, B &amp; C-10 &amp; 11, C-16, E &amp; F-21 &amp; 22, C-21 &amp; 22, D-22 &amp; 23, D &amp; E-25 &amp; 26), perhaps in their role of calling down the gods to produce rain (Zingg 1938:458). Lumholtz (1900:20) found that control of rainfall was attributed to the singing shamans who were supposed to be able to produce it at will. The gods on the outskirts of Huichol country are reluctant to let the rain go, but eventually do so because the singing of the shaman pleases them. "During the dry season and a part of the wet-that is to say, from the beginning of April to the end of August-the Huichols are constantly making feasts to produce rain" (Lumholtz 1902[1II]:10). On the other hand, there is nothing specific about Huichol symbolism which might lead to the identification of these pictographs as representations of shamans. In fact, the Huichol rarely use anthropomorphic designs. However, the pictograph at the C-21 &amp; 22 location in Figure 4 appears to be a humanlike figure holding on to what the Huichol would probably interpret as the lightning baton of Mother East Water. The lines running through the body of the figure may relate to the modern practice of so representing the soul or essence of an animal with a "lifeline" (Phil Weigand, personal communication), or the use of "skeletonization" or depiction of individuals or phenomena such as shamans, animals, and plants in a sort of x-ray style (Furst 1978:23). Another pictograph, that of the spiral (Figure 5:N; Figure 4: G-7 &amp; 8, G-18-20, E &amp; F-16, D-19 &amp; 20, D- 23 &amp; 24, F &amp; G-25, E-25) has a multitude of possible meanings, although most of these recorded by Lumholtz relate to the coiled serpent, water, and corn (Mountjoy 1974:27-28). In those cases where the spirals interlock, such as location G-7 &amp; 8, they may signify the clasped hands of the gods (Lumholtz 1900:200). Up near the top of the back wall of the rock scar are many horizontal zig-zag lines (Figure 5:0; Figure 4:G-13 &amp; 14, G-18-20). Lumholtz in his 1904 study says that a single line of this sort may represent the fire serpent or the earth with hills and valleys (plate xxi), and solid triangles turned upward symbolize clouds (plate xix). In his study of Huichol symbolism he notes that the solid up- turned triangles on a line may mean clouds when painted on the face, and sometimes maize plants (1900:197-198). Several parallel horizontal zig-zag lines may be used to represent the wind, but commonly are used to depict the earth with hills and valleys. When these lines are red, mountains are sometimes indicated (Lumholtz 1900:57), and when red and yellow, the clouds at sunset (Lumholtz 1900:135). Rising over these designs on the back wall is a disc with short rays on the perimeter and a hole in the center (Figure 5:P; Figure 4:G-16 &amp; 17). This appears most likely to represent the sun god depicted as a front-shield. According to Huichol mythology the little shields they make to leave as offerings to the gods are in imitation of those used by the ancient warrior. He carried a round shield to protect his front and a rectangular one to protect his back. The hole in the front-shield would have served as a peephole during battle. In later times this hole became the symbolic eye of the god to which the shield was dedicated. Of course there are front-shields dedicated to many gods, such as Corn Mother, Mother East Water and Mother West Water, but from Lumholtz's il- lustrations it appears to me that the ones dedicated to Father Sun are the most similar to the pic- tograph. Lumholtz (1900:110) said this about Father Sun: To the Indian the Sun, of course, is a man. He was created by the shamans themselves in ancient times, as told before. Every time he rises in the east we see his front-shield, represented today by the ceremonial shields made for him. The central part of a front-shield, always defined by a ring, represents the hole through which the god sees, that is to say, his face especially. Therefore the hole is sometimes designated by a hoop, the centre being left open. Lumholtz stressed the importance of Huichol worship, describing in his diary a sun dance, com- plete with ropes and a pole (1902[II]:46), and noted that the Indians often beseech the sun to send rain. Robert Zingg (1938:309) provides some additional information on Father Sun and on his relation to Grandfather Fire, observing that although Grandfather Fire came first in Huichol mythology, [Vol. 47, No. 1, 1982] 120</page><page sequence="12">REPORTS Father Sun is the greatesto the he dry-season gods, and Grandfather Fire is conceived of as a sing- ing shaman whose singing of the Huichol myth of the Sun-father tamed the Sun. Until he was tamed he burned the world. Ifceremonies dedichl faithfte tobserve the ceremonies dedicated to the Sun, he will refrain from scorching the cornfields. According to Zingg (1938:309-310), "Huichol ceremonies are thus actually believed to keep the sun and rain in proper proportions for the suc- cess of the corn-beans-squash agriculture. The ceremonies are timed exactly as though they brought this about" (emphasis supplied). Now attention must be turned to the interpretation of the ceiling of the La Pefia Pintada rock scar. Here the remnants of six or more huge stick figures can be found, most of which have up- turned arms (Figure 5:Q; Figure 4:J-O, 8-21). At the turn of the century the Huichol appear to have made extremely limited use of anthropomorphic figures in their art, especially considering the abundance of representations of other animals and of plants. However, one of a very few excep- tions seems to have been Grandfather Fire. Lumholtz (1900:39) says: "T he cardinal points . . . are taken from a bas-relief of Grandfather Fire in his the temple of Santa Catarina. He is seen as a man with arms uplifted, the palms of the hands turned forward, and the face toward the sunrise." In another place (Lumholtz 1900:144), on the back-shield of Father Sun, "the god of fire, as the supreme deity, rests in the middle of the world. The mountains and valleys are clothed in verdure, because the fire, greatest of all shamans, is able to procure rain." The col- or red is cited by Lumholtz as the sacred color of the sun, although it may also symbolize the ar- rows of Grandfather Fire, peyote, rain, and life in general. Sometimes it is associated with Mother East Water as well. Of course, red is the color of the pictographs. Further it may be significant to note that the pictographs are in a cavelike rock scar, and caves in Huichol country are extremely sacred places. They are treated in much the same way as the god houses (temples), for offerings of prayer arrows and other sacred objects are deposited in them. The caves are even called by the same linguistic term as the god houses. Zingg (1938:351-352) states that both the caves and the offerings in them are projections of the per- sonality of the god to which they are dedicated, and the essence of that god dwells there. Further- more, at least some caves appear to have functioned as places where someone wishing to become a singing shaman or a curing shaman might go to receive the requisite divine revelation. In general, it seems to me that these caves are conceptualized by the Huichol as roughly equivalent to the votive gourd bowls into which they press the designs which give physical expression to the prayers for good crops, luck in the hunt, etc., and each of these individual designs is a prayer for the thing it depicts. As the eyes of the gods look down upon the earth, the eyes of the supplicant's votive bowls and offering-littered caves look up toward the gods, conveying their message of specific human needs. Even the Huichol village plan, house form, and ceremonial seating ar- rangements may conform to this all-pervasive underlying cognitive pattern. It is apparent from the above discussion that not all of the pictographs on the back wall or the ceiling of the La Penia Pintada rock scar have analogous symbols in Huichol Indian art. However, on the basis of the many pictographs which can be interpreted in light of Huichol symbolism it is possible to "read" the painted rock scar as an integrated scene with distinctive conceptual subareas, (Figure 4) much like a Huichol shaman might "read" the designs organized within a votive bowl. On the lower part of the back wall rain is falling upon the earth and bringing fertility to the maize, squash, and deer so important for Indian subsistence. The diminutive shamans, not to be confused with the huge stick-figure gods on the ceiling, stand among the plant and animal symbols calling down the rain. Above ground level, and dominating it, is the sun, rising above the cloud-draped mountains to the east. Over the sun and the mountains is the ceiling which represents the sky-domain of the gods. And the huge gods in the heavens may signify a deity like the Huichol Grandfather Fire or Father Sun-the ultimate source of rain. PICTOGRAPH SYMBOLISM AND ASTRONOMY If the above interpretation is correct, why are there several gods in the sky portion of the rock scar? Might this indicate that the Indians were utilizing the transits of some heavenly body as a 121</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY calendrical marker to help predict some important yearly events, such as the onset and the end of the rainy season? Some of the possibilities are examined below in order of diminishing probabili- ty. First, the most probable interpretation is that the pictographs reveal the use of calendrical calculations based on the location of the sun along the eastern horizon. The mountains, above which the sun is shown rising in the pictographs, may be those which are visible to the east and north from within the rock scar. As noted before, the rock scar opens 45? east of north. It should have been possible to calculate the solstices and the equinox by sighting on specific peaks or valleys along the mountainous horizon, as has been suggested for other areas in Mesoamerica, such as at Alta Vista, Zacatecas (Aveni et al. 1978). There is some support for this idea in Huichol ethnography. Robert Zingg (1938:455-457) at- tended a Huichol rain ceremony on June 9, 1934, and his description gives some indication of the importance these Indians gave to solar observations. He recorded how the family altars were brought out of the house and the saints placed facing the eastern horizon. The shaman worked himself into a frenzy, singing and weeping, as blood, water, and newly lighted candles were of- fered to the cardinal directions. The ceremony was brought to a climax as the sun rose over the horizon to be greeted by the shaman and his assistants. At this extremely sacred moment another shaman pointed a feathered wand toward the rising sun, and with a ceremonial feather he mo- tioned toward the wand, bringing down the Sun god to the wand. Zingg (1938:458) noted: "When he has caught enough of the god, he slowly and carefully brings it down and the other shamans carefully brush off the feathers so that the god is actually brought down to the offertory bowls which are held in position to catch the god." This could be the modern remnant of a more complex sun calendar used by the Huichol in Pre-Hispanic times. Antonio Arias de Sabedra, writing in 1673 (Arias de Sabedra 1899:18-27; McCarty and Matson 1975), describes the gods of the Cora Indians (northern neighbors of the Huichol, with essentially the same language, see Figure 1) and mentions their use of a sun calendar which appears to have been based on observation points along the horizon. He recorded that the Cora god Pyltzintli had his seat in the sun in the east, and that the rising of the Pyltzintli sun on March 21, September 21, and December 21 awakened in turn the other three gods who held dominion over fall, winter, and spring and the produce associated with each of these seasons. Furthermore, he found that "wherever the seasonal passages of the sun are recognized, at all the hills which are at the point where the Pyltzintli sun passes, there they worship with statues and a variety of forms of clay, wood, stone, and crosses or X-shaped devices for observing their cult dedicated to the seasons" (Arias de Sabedra 1899:25; translation supplied by author). The season solely associated with Pyltzintli was the summer rainy season, which began sometime after June 21 and ended by September 21. The Indians attributed to him the unleashing of storms, thunder, and lightning. Perhaps, therefore, the several large pictographs on the ceiling of the La Pefia Pintada rock scar are meant to indicate the seasonal transits of the Sun god in relation to the eastern skyline and therefore symbolize a sun calendar. However, it must be noted that in the mountain territory of the Huichol, with its humid temperate climate, the rainy season does not begin until sometime in June, and lasts through the middle of October (Viv6 Escoto 1964:210). But down on the coast of Jalisco, in the tropical wet-and-dry climate, the rains break loose around mid-May and reach the heaviest level of precipitation during September and October (Viv6 Escoto 1964:212). With a solar calendar in use it would be simple enough to count the days from the solstices to the onset or the end of the rainy season, and over a period of time arrive at a calculation which would allow prediction of the events. But on the other hand, the dates of the solstices do not bracket the rainy season so closely along the coast as they do in the highlands. Another possible sky deity calendrical marker which could be represented by the ceiling pic- tographs is the planet Venus, so important in Maya Indian calendrical calculations. The Huichol recognize Venus as the morning star, and Preuss's (1912) study of the Cora Indians indicates that they place ceremonial emphasis on observing the movements of the morning star. Preuss (1968) provides an intriguing account of the importance of the morning star for some Nahua-speaking In- dians living in the village of San Pedro just to the north of Cora-Huichol country, near the Tepehuan Indians. He specifically states that the ideas he found there relating to the morning star and other stars were essentially the same as those held by the Coras, including the concept that [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982] 122</page><page sequence="14">REPORTS the stars are deer which are hunted by the morning star (1968:123), and that the morning star and the evening star go out in the night hunting for jaguar or puma (1968:216). In synthesizing the myths of these Indians regarding the ascension of the morning star Preuss (1968:218) notes: In the winter the god of maize is a star in the sky and in the spring he descends to the earth, loses his bright- ness and becomes impure, diseased with scabies. On one hand, he is equivalent to the maize and the vegeta- tion, and on the other he produces growth. His helpers are the deer, which are believed to symbolically represent the stars. In this case the god of maize definitely represents the morning star because (the Cora word) cital can be translated as morning-star. Furthermore, he is also the culture hero who cultivated the first maize-field. For this reason people began to plant maize after being shown by the morning star which then rose into the sky as the evening star. Because the maize god returns as a star to the sky during harvest time, he loses the scabies as soon as he begins to shine brightly once again ltranslation supplied by author]. Ramon Mata Torres (1973:41) has found that a simple cross, like the one on the pictograph ceil- ing (Figure 5:R; Figure 4:J-19-20), represents a star when used to embellish modern Huichol masks. Lumholtz (1900:213) recorded that a Latin cross in red was the Huichol symbol for the morning star-although the same figures as the pictograph might also be used to depict the car- dinal points, money, or a spark (Lumholtz 1904:plates XIX, XXX, XXI). However, a planet such as Venus appears to be a rather erratic celestial marker for purposes of annual calendrical calcula- tions when compared to stars or star clusters. This is because the exact dates when Venus would change from a morning star to an evening star differ considerably from year to year. Certainly this variable periodicity would have been a poor basis on which to base a simple annual calendar useful for predicting the onset and the end of the rainy season. There is another possibility for relating the ceiling pictographs to a celestial calendar based neither on the sun nor on Venus. This would involve the use of the star constellation Orion as the basis for a wet season-dry season calendar. There is a resemblance between the central and most complete stick figure pictograph on the rock scar ceiling (Figure 5:Q; Figure 4:J-M, 14-16) and the star cluster configuration of Orion as it is perceived in modern times. This similarity includes the bi-lobed configuration of the pictograph figure's stomach, resembling the stars in and around Orion's belt. The figures of legs and arms are likewise perceivable in the stars in the sOrion con- stellation, as is the arch over the pictograph's hands and head. If the pictograph were meant to represent Orion, it would follow that the large red star being speared with the trident is Betelgeuse, and the constellation down below his right foot (Figure 4:1 &amp; J, 13 &amp; 14) might be Canis Major or the star Sirius of that group. In sum, although it is admittedly rather ethnocentric to assume that the Tomatlan Indians perceived that star cluster as we do, there is a similarity be- tween what we perceive in modern times as the humanlike configuration of the Orion constella- tion, and the central anthropomorphic pictograph figure on the ceiling at La Penia Pintada. There is, however, some added support for this thesis. The celestial movement of Orion fulfills some of the astronomical characteristics which could qualify it as a good wet season-dry season calendrical marker. The pictograph site is located only 6 min and 30 sec south of the 20? latitude line. Based on general astronomy coordinates (Jerry Meisner, personal communication, U.N.C., G astronomy professor) at this location in the middle of April the Orion constellation would be descending in the evening twilight from 8:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. on the western horizon. By May 15, approximate onset of the rainy season, Orion would not be visible at all in the evening sky. By the middle of August, Orion would begin to be visible on the eastern horizon for about 2 hours and 30 minutes before being obliterated by the morning twilight. By November 15, the approximate end of the rainy season, Orion would be seen rising on the eastern horizon at 8:00 p.m., and by mid-December would make the complete east-west transit of the evening sky between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. In this way Orion could have been perceived by the Tomatlan valley Indians as a rain god who, upon descending to the earth in May, brought the annual rains so important for the local crops. At the end of the rainy season he would begin to rise again to take his place in the evening sky as the dominant winter constellation in the northern hemisphere. The approximately seven large pictograph stick figures on the ceiling at La Penia Pintada (Figure 4) might therefore signify the calculations of the movement of Orion across the sky in relation to the sunrise on the eastern horizon, or the sunset on the western horizon. It may be important to note that the best time to have painted the pictographs would have been 123</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY between November and May, when Orion was the major constellation in the winter sky. This is because the ledge in front of the rock scar gives a much firmer footing during the dry season, whereas seeping water during the summer rainy season makes the steeply slanted floor of the rock scar areas so slippery that entry unaided by ropes or some other safety device would have been extremely dangerous, if not impossible, for the Indians. The calendrical use of constellations by ancient Mesoamericans has been studied by many researchers. Beyer (1965:271) has suggested that the Toltecs had a zodiac in which one of the con- tellations was Orion. Michael Coe (1975:25-26) discusses the possibility that Sahagun recorded the worship of the Orion constellation by the central Mexican Indians, and furthermore notes (1975:13) that the modern Chorti Maya Indians use the position of Orion's belt, the Southern Cross, and the Pleiades in the night sky on April 30 to signal the first passage of the sun across the zenith. One other pictograph on the ceiling at La Pefia Pintada deserves some attention. This is the crescent and ball found on the ceiling at location I &amp; J-15-16 (Figure 4). This pictograph is generally similar to many which have been discovered in the American Southwest and believed by some investigators to be a record of the Crab Nebula supernova which appeared on the morn- ing of July 4 in the year A.D. 1054. The thesis that this event was recorded in rock art by Southwestern Indians was first advanced by William Miller (1955), and has received a recent re- examination by J. C. Brandt and R. A. Williamson (1979). This argument is partially based on the observation that when the Crab Nebula supernova became visible in western North America on the morning of July 5, it would have been close to the crescent moon, down below the lower point of a right-facing crescent (Brandt et al. 1975:46-69). Thus, rock art which could have been ex- ecuted around A.D. 1054 and which depicts a ball or star in close conjunction with a crescent are thought by some to constitute a record of that spectacular celestial event. After Miller's original publication of two such depictions in rock art, several other examples have come to light (Brandt et al. 1975; Mayer 1977; Wellmann 1979). But Florence Hawley Ellis (1975) has published a well- reasoned article suggesting, on the basis of a study of celestial observations in ethnographic records of Pueblo Indian culture, that the so-called A.D. 1054 supernova depictions in rock art are better explained as markers for Pueblo sun-watchers' observation stations. Since this controversy is not yet settled, I merely want to point out that the ball and crescent on the ceiling at La Pefia Pintada may be cited as another example of this type of depiction in rock art. There would seem to be no present conflict between the date of the celestial event and the assumed date of occupation by the Indians believed responsible for painting the pictographs; and certainly the ball and crescent are in the proper place in the rock scar-on the ceiling, which ap- pears to represent the sky. On the other hand, although the Crab supernova was close to the Orion constellation, according to Japanese accounts of the event in A.D. 1054 (Brandt and Williamson 1979), it would not have appeared off the left foot of Orion. Indeed, in July when the supernova first appeared, Orion would not have been visible in the night sky. In addition, the ball is at the up- per end of the crescent rather than the lower. However, the A.D. 1054 supernova was apparently visible for 23 days during daylight hours and continued visible in the night sky for 653 days (Brandt et al. 1975:46); finally, there is the probability that the event could not have been recorded in the sky area of the La Pefia Pintada rock scar until long after it had first appeared in the sky, because of the water seepage problem which might have prevented access to the pictograph panel during the summer months. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Regardless of whether the giant stick figures on the pictograph ceiling represented the Sun god, Venus, or Orion, it does appear that the Tomatlan area Indians left a record of a considerable por- tion of their cosmology, painted in an organized fashion on the ceiling and back wall of the rock scar, and that this cosmology is at least partially decipherable through analysis of the organiza- tional and symbolic content of the pictographs based on an ethnographic model derived primarily from Huichol culture.
