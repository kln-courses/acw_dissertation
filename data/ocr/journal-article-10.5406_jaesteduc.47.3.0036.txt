<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s   A Thousand Plateaus for Music Education ESTELLE R. JORGENSEN AND IRIS M. YOB Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s work has been mined by writers about  music and music education such as Ian Buchanan, Marcel Swiboda, Mari- anne Kielian-Gilbert, and Elizabeth Gould, as they have reflected on how  music and music education should be construed.1 Our present task is to ex- amine critically Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas in our reading of their book A  Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, with a view to determining  the merits of their ideas as a basis for a philosophy of music education.2 As  such, we ask three principal questions: What are Deleuze and Guattari ask- ing us to believe? What is our assessment of their contributions and detrac- tions? What are the implications of our analysis for music education?  Throughout their work, Deleuze and Guattari employ a number of meta- phors to capture the essence of their ideas, despite occasionally disparaging  their use (TP, 77).3 Their work is indeed rich with metaphors, many drawn  from psychiatric thought and reinforced with those expressed in the arts,  especially the literary and visual arts. We will occasionally highlight some  of these metaphors—in particular, the rhizome, body without organs, the  face, territorialization, the nomad, and the war machine—examining what  they reveal, not from a ground in psychiatry or literary criticism but from  the perspective of education, particularly music education.

Nor do we want to get bogged down unnecessarily in technical  terminology. Notwithstanding Deleuze and Guattari’s suspicion of clarity  as a potent agent of power (TP, 227–28), we prefer to shine whatsoever light  we are able onto their ideas, explain their gist as we see them as plainly as  we can, and critique them especially for what they imply for music educa- tion. Our efforts at comprehension, clarity, and fair-mindedness prompt us  to disagree with Deleuze and Guattari that “[i]t is in vain that we say what  we see: What we see never resides in what we say” (67). Although it may  be difficult to capture ideas fully in words, without the words in which to  think and with which to speak, we may not be in a position to grasp self,  the world, and whatever lie beyond our lived realities in particular ways.  Our reading of Deleuze and Guattari suggests the possibility of explaining  their ideas in ordinary language without resorting constantly to the special  sense in which they use particular technical terms. The opaqueness of their  exposition may suggest brilliance of thought, just as it may mask nonsense  and error. This being the case, we subject their ideas to the self-same analysis  as those of any philosopher.  We would like to see a greater self-reflexivity and self-criticism regarding  “postmodern” ideas in philosophical writing in music education, just as we  expect to encounter it in regard to other philosophical work.4 Although it is  natural for the proponents of postmodern ideas to explore how they chal- lenge modern philosophy and practice and how they could make a differ- ence for music education, it is also crucial to ask the hard questions regard- ing the bases and merits of these ideas. In so doing and since our approach  is consonant with an analytic tradition in philosophy, our study may prompt  a more critical approach to postmodern ideas and indicate how other such  ideas might be examined critically as well as constructively. Some Propositions Critiqued What are Deleuze and Guattari asking us to believe? And what is our  assessment of these ideas? To begin, we are being asked to replace one  system of thought with its inversion. For Deleuze and Guattari, the es- tablished approach to philosophy in the Western European tradition repre- sents that of the State: philosophers are its domesticated servants, thinking  those thoughts that are representative of, consonant with, or cultivated by  the interests of the State; approaching their work within established tenets  of abstract reason unencumbered by emotion; working within a closed- system of thought; and sidelining, separating, and suppressing minority  </page> <page sequence="3"> 38  Jorgensen and Yob interests from the trajectory of the main-line majority thinking of white,  educated males.  One of the first metaphors we encounter in this text is the rhizome. De- leuze and Guattari’s metaphor for the system of thought and accompany- ing practice that has characterized the Western European tradition is the  tree with its tap root reaching beneath the surface as a foundation for all  that is above it. This objectified, striated, hierarchical, transcendent, logical,  closed, static, abstract realm of thought is now to be repudiated in favor of  its inversion—a subjectified, politicized, mystical, cosmic, flat, imminent,  smooth, open, dynamic, abstract realm of thought. Here, the rhizome with  its multiplicities of elements and interconnections, no one of which is nec- essarily foundational or primary, and without beginning or ending, but in  a constant and dynamic state of flow and becoming, captures this replace- ment view.  Compared with constant references throughout the text to machines, the  rhizome is organic, a living or at least a potentially living form that can grow  under the right circumstances. The tap root, of course, is the same in many  respects, for it too is an organic part of a living plant. The rhizome, however,  carries within itself more potential. The tap root is likely to die separated  from the tree, although pesky shoots may continue to grow after the tree is  felled. The rhizome, on the other hand, sits brooding, waiting simply for the  right soil and moisture conditions. It is very difficult to destroy a rhizome,  for it can wait several seasons on the gardener’s shelf, full of potential.  Lacking the structure of the tap root, the rhizome is amorphous, promis- cuous, even chaotic. It has a freedom to grow in any direction and respond  to any conditions that might seem fruitful. Its creative impulses are unboth- ered by rules and regulations. And rhizomic bodies of knowledge that might  have been excluded by tap-rooted knowledge have an opportunity to flour- ish. But we should ask: Will they need to develop their own tap roots to  become coherent, meaningful, and applicable? Are tap roots useless, unpro- ductive, and unnecessary? Should taproots be dug up and thrown away, or  should they too be allowed to flourish in the garden of knowledge?  We stop short of referring to this inversion as a “paradigm shift” since  there is much in Deleuze and Guattari’s writing that betrays their roots in  and commitments to European philosophy. Nor do we view their writing as  sufficiently revolutionary or even praxial in the transformative or Freirian  sense of aspiring to change the world not only through a different way of  seeing it but of acting in, with, and upon it. Still, Deleuze and Guattari seem  like prophets crying in the wilderness, representatives of nomads, those dis- enfranchised, excluded, marginalized, faceless, and landless wanderers who  dwell on the fringes in the minority and are besieged by the all-powerful  State, its apparatuses and its minions. They would like to dismantle the State  and its apparatus, but they do not provide a practical plan for achieving this.  </page> <page sequence="4"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  39 Their ideas remain just that—abstract machines whereby people may think  differently about what they are and do. While this Either/Or approach might  yield tyrannies on either side, they regard this possibility as immaterial and  unavoidable and see the real test of their ideas in how they are useful and  what can be accomplished with them. The end justifies the means. And the  proof, ultimately, is in the pudding.  The dualities that Deleuze and Guattari see as inimical to or characteristic  of European philosophy are employed as vehicles to arrive at a process that  “challenges all models.” They write, “We invoke one dualism only in order  to challenge another” (TP, 20). Contra dualistic or dialectical thinking, they  espouse a theoretical world of multiplicities thought of mechanistically and  topologically. They are interested in the connections and ground “between  things” rather than in the simplistic and static realities of what they take to  be the dialectical or dualistic thinking of Western philosophy that they see  as tending toward synthesis, unity, and harmony. In order to arrive at this  world, their analysis is shot through with dualities of one sort or another.  Even when they arrive at their new view, dualities lurk within and without  it and in its plateaus, cracks, and fissures. Now, these dualities often com- prise polar opposites that provide the source of energy for the current that  runs betwixt and between them in both directions. Double articulations are  evident everywhere (TP, 40): for example, in content and expression (57,  416), form and substance (63, 416), semiotic and symbolic expression (63),  territorialized and deterritorialized movement (88), major and minor modes  (106), subjectification and objectification (167), offensive and defensive pos- tures (218), inhibiting and organizing forms of resonance (218), abstract  mechanisms of overcoding and mutation (223), planes of transcendence and  consistency (226, 423), immanence and transcendence (270), punctuated and  linear musical systems and approaches (294–95), arborescent and rhizom- atic models (328), classicism and romanticism (338–42), magician-kings and  jurist-priests (354), state science and nomad science (362, 364), logos (word)  and nomos (object) (369), smooth and striated space (384, 474), declination  and vortex (489), to name several. The currents that flow back and forth  among these various poles cannot disguise and even require the presence of  dualities in this new model. One set of dualities has been replaced by anoth- er in a philosophical sleight of hand. Although Deleuze and Guattari urge  us to abandon the “strata, segmentarities, sedentarity, and State apparatus,”  they posit an alternative “theory-of-everything-in-the-world” with its own  axioms, principles, propositions, and theorems, and its own, albeit different,  strata, segmentarities, sedentarity, and apparatus requiring its own order,  identity, and negation (24). And in this new world, philosophers of the old  order have been banished to be the new nomads and replaced by others  with differing commitments but a similar urge to make the world in their  own image. </page> <page sequence="5"> 40  Jorgensen and Yob  Deleuze and Guattari’s argument by analogy regards such disparate  fields as mathematics, physics, geology, astronomy, psychoanalysis, political  science, zoology, archaeology, economics, religion, music, and cosmology as  interconnected. In their view, it is possible to negotiate these fields more or  less seamlessly or smoothly and make valid analogies between the various  ways of construing the world. Rather than regarding analogies as potential- ly limited or even problematic, they assemble and defend them positively as  if all things were united at the core. For them, this unity is based in the en- ergy and vibration, movement and stasis, attraction and resistance evident  throughout the cosmos, all the way from the “primordial soup” to musical  expressions, theological beliefs and practices, political constructions, and  scientific and mathematical propositions. Since all things are interconnected,  literally and figuratively, it is important to articulate and map these inter- connections. One thing sheds light upon another, as the lobster does upon  God, the nomad does upon the State, the wolf does upon human behavior,  or the machine does upon human thought.  The metaphor of the body without organs might very well appeal to  some educators, especially those who conceive of their role as guides and  facilitators for the young as they construct a life of their own. As Deleuze  and Guattari put it, we do not come “ready-made” (TP, 149). The metaphor  turns the tabula rasa model on its head in the sense that it is not the teacher  writing out the life of the child by imparting wisdom and knowledge to  that child. Instead, one imagines from the discussion of the body without  organs that the teacher’s role, if any role at all, is to facilitate the learner  in dismantling her sense of self, bodily worth, and psychic subjectivity, by  removing the heart, kidneys, lungs, hands, and face to an empty trunk, in  other words, to its shapeless intensities and energies so that something new  can be constructed.  One of the appealing elements of the metaphor as Deleuze and Guattari  write about it is the inviting nature of the body without organs (BwO): “[I]t  awaits you,” they tell us, and it seems to be an awesome thing (TP, 149). The  construction is full of challenge: “[Y]ou can botch it,” “it can be terrifying,” it  can even “lead you to your death.” On it, we “experience untold happiness  and fabulous defeats.” In typical fashion, the description is confusing, for  we seem both to be a BwO, yet we also strive to reach it; we are a BwO yet  also live our lives “on it.” Sometimes, the body wants to slough off its organs  (149–50), that is, overthrow imposed organization, while, at other times, it  seeks to create new ones, that is, by desirings; but all the while the BwO  is ripe with becoming possibilities. The spiraling and alternating phases of  construction and deconstruction are characteristic of human development, a  process that is seldom given full credit in developmental psychology, which  describes the life’s journey only in terms of upward and positive movement. </page> <page sequence="6"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  41  Yet the metaphor may, in reality, seem a little less appropriate for some  than for others simply because there are significant differences in how the  body is experienced. In a white person’s world, an ethnic minority, very  aware of how bodies are different, may already see theirs as bodies with- out organs in some respects and filled with organs not of their choosing in  another respect. In a man’s world, it is women who birth bodies; feed and  cloth bodies; make homes for bodies; comfort and mend and nurture bodies  bodily; care for sick bodies; and, in many cultures, prepare bodies for burial.  For women, this metaphor may suggest that their care of bodies with organs  has been misguided.  However, it would be a misreading of Deleuze and Guattari if one were  to read their discussion of the body without organs as an attempt to either  remove or bring corporeality into consideration, as Elizabeth Grosz notes.5  The trouble is, though, that, once the body has been introduced, the reader  has the freedom to interpret and critique the metaphor as we (and many  other feminist writers6) have done.  Moving on to Deleuze and Guattari’s primary point about the body,  though, we begin to get into very deep waters, for the objective is to “find  your body without organs,” “to dismantle the self” (TP, 151). Presumably,  this is the self that has been put in place by some authority, organized and  structured and dead in ways that the BwO is not dead. The BwO is “occu- pied, populated only by intensities” (153), but these are not signifiances or  subjectivities or phantasies. Rather, they are transformative and kinematic  energies. Here we would note that it is difficult to paraphrase what Deleuze  and Guattari mean exactly, and we wonder if this is not the reason that many  commentators on their ideas are reduced to quoting large passages directly  from their writings. For instance, on this point we read: The BwO causes intensities to pass; it produces and distributes them  in a spatium that is itself intensive, lacking extension. It is not space,  nor is it in space; it is a matter that occupies space to a given degree— to the degree corresponding to the intensities produced. It is nonstrati- fied, unformed, intense matter, the matrix of intensity, intensity = 0;  but there is nothing negative about that zero, there are no negative or  opposite intensities. Matter equals energy. (TP, 153)  So what are we to make of such a description? Or on the surface of it, does  this mechanistic, geographic, mathematical description explain moments of  potentiality and enlighten us at all? If not, then we should look to our writ- ers for additional explications of the BwO. There is talk of the BwO being  opposed not to organs but to organizations of organs into organisms (TP,  158) and not to “disarticulation as the property of the plane of consistency,  experimentation as the operation on that plane, and nomadism as the move- ment” (159). But these additional insights do not seem to rise to the level of  </page> <page sequence="7"> 42  Jorgensen and Yob clarity either, and the play on words and endless cycle of metaphoric refer- ence to other metaphors only seem to complicate rather than to explicate.  There are glimpses of something profound behind and between the words,  sometimes rising to the surface as instances of coherence and inspiration. In  this context, one such moment occurs when Deleuze and Guattari talk about  how we are bound and oppressed as people with organs: You will be organized, you will be an organism, you will articulate  your body—otherwise you’re just depraved. You will be signifier and  signified, interpreter and interpreted—otherwise you’re just deviant.  You will be a subject, nailed down as one, a subject of enunciation re- coiled into a subject of the statement—otherwise you’re just a tramp.  (TP, 159)  That is the reason one with active desire, who reaches for freedom and prob- ably sanity, needs to achieve the body without organs, throwing off all the  accoutrements imposed on one over time, defining one. But it is disturb- ing to read about the origins of this metaphor. Deleuze and Guattari draw  their inspiration from psychopathology: hypochondria, schizophrenia, mas- ochism, and anorexia. “We must start here,” they assure us, because it is  important to know why these pathologies happened (TP, 150). In essence,  we all are sick and need to do what the hypochondriacs, schizophrenics,  masochists, and anorexics do but do it more thoroughly: step back to the  place where we can find our body without organs, for, until we locate it,  we cannot figure out how to construct it anew. What is particularly pathetic  about us, they explain, is that we are already on our BwO, “scurrying like  vermin, groping like a blind person, or running like a lunatic” all over it  (150). While our human-development approaches to young learners may  have been viewed through rose-tinted glasses, far too optimistic and blind  to the realities of growing up, this metaphor and all its attendant metaphors  take us a long way, probably even too far, in the opposite direction toward  corrective or balancing measures. We propose that helping ourselves and  others grow healthily does not have to start with making them sick first;  deconstruction does not have to be destructive.  In developing a philosophy of education, we question whether this  metaphor, apart from being somewhat unclear and abstruse, has much  of substance to inform our purposes and practices. Primarily, it suggests  preventatives—preventing the build up of subjectivities, articulations, and  significances. But no matter what we do with the curriculum and organiza- tion of education, these are the very things we cannot prevent, for these are  the work of education. At the most, this metaphor alerts us to the negative  downside of our work with the young: shaping, constricting, prescribing  according to our (or the State’s or some other imposing institution’s) de- sign. But, in essence, the body without organs is a corrective rather than a  </page> <page sequence="8"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  43 forward-looking concept; it suggests what we should not do but is largely  silent about what we should do.  We might expect a model preoccupied with space and territoriality to  emerge from Deleuze and Guattari’s emphasis on exteriority, or the search  for how things may be beyond the self and grounded in things in the phe- nomenal world, in contrast with interiority, in which things external to self  are explained in terms of one person’s subjective view that is then employed  to interpret the external world. Still, this view is curiously Cartesian in its  bifurcation of self and whatever lies beyond, even as the model works in- versely to the way Descartes hypothesized. It is certainly a very masculine  view and different from the ways in which women may see the world, at  least, as Carol Gilligan describes things.7  Instead, visual maps abound with grids, lines of latitude and longitude,  flow diagrams, vectors, lines that transcend horizontal and vertical into a  third and other dimensions. As Deleuze and Guattari explain, these lines  bifurcate space and seem to “flatten” the disjunctions and striations and  “smooth” otherwise “rough” surfaces. The plethora of lines and surfaces,  directionality between points, and abstract planes that intersect or parallel  each other focused on sight rather than sound are juxtaposed in various ab- stract assemblages. Sound is something of an anomaly, at once more diffuse,  abstract, and ambiguous than sight. Music and mathematics, exemplified  by Deleuze and Guattari as consonant with the world of smooth spaces that  they wish to create, seem curiously out of tune with this visually construed  external space. A topographic and geometric preoccupation seems conso- nant, however, with the evocation of abstract machines or assemblages that  navigate the terrain according to particular rules (TP, 70 71). The little Rover  navigating Mars, and getting stuck after years of wandering about across  particular coordinates springs to mind as an image of how this exteriority  seems to work. The Rover’s position can constantly be monitored, fixed,  modeled neatly, lines drawn between point to point as the Rover moves  from one to another until it inevitably gets stuck, at which time newer ma- chines are needed.  What happens to these machines after their usefulness has passed, or  they, in turn, become stuck, whichever comes first, and to the resulting litter  on the conceptual ground is unclear. Deleuze and Guattari seem to suppose  that the materials in the machines are recycled or transformed to make other  machines by means of “assemblage converters” (TP, 325). They also write  that things are discarded and left behind, and, after the passage of time, one  supposes that a super machine or a dedicated junk-removing machine will  be needed to destroy the debris—a giant vacuum that can suck up or eat the  litter or deposit it who knows where—maybe further out in space where it  may be less of an immediate problem. So, machines are needed to create and  to destroy what is made. </page> <page sequence="9"> 44  Jorgensen and Yob  The mechanosphere, as Deleuze and Guattari describe their world (TP,  69), requires a cartographic and mechanistic imaginary that supposes the  destruction of biosphere, noosphere, and all other spheres, for that mat- ter. Things personal and spiritual seem to be swallowed up in the quest for  exteriority and its inevitable requisite conquest and mapping of territory.  Rather than illumine self qua self, the model sees self only in terms of one’s  roots in the “primordial soup” and the agencies of the external world, and  becoming in terms of those other things rather than in respect of one’s grow- ing internal knowledge of one’s physical, mental, psychological, gendered,  and spiritual self. In the process, morality has lost humanity and become  mechanistic, animalistic, and physical or elemental. Even the advocate for  the mechanosphere, Professor Challenger, becomes a machine, “an abnor- mal clock ticking” in the “dark, cosmic rhythm of the mechanosphere or  rhizosphere” (74). We are left not only with a vision of machines captur- ing the very ones who design, produce, and use them but of some invisible  power in the machine—shades of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other cinematic  fantasies—that ultimately destroys human selves and even the cosmos.  Not surprisingly, the obsession with territoriality obviates war when the  powerful State and its institutions are resisted by nomads who represent  minority perspectives and peoples. These powerful forces and resistances  require war machinery or technologies to mount offensives and defend ter- ritory, be it conceptual or physical. The militarism exerted by the State and  nomad has its counterpoint, Deleuze and Guattari argue, in forces in the  physical world. The entire mechanosphere is shot through at the molar and  molecular level with militarism as territory is recaptured, ground is given, or  new territory is acquired. Applying as it does not only to political, economic,  and historical realities but also to abstract ideas, territoriality is indicative  of power and control (or the gaining, waning, ceding, or removing of this  power and control). Dynamic and evolutionary ideas of adaptation, survival  in a hostile environment, and transformation or becoming seem to take on a  militaristic nuance, and survival becomes the raison d’être of existence.  A case in point is the State’s imposition on children of language or, as  Deleuze and Guattari put it, “semiotic coordinates possessing all of the dual  foundations of grammar,” which is undertaken as an agency of power and  control so that words will be “obeyed” (TP, 75–76). This attempt at subjuga- tion must be met by the nomad’s utilization of the “war machine” to defend,  if possible, the importance of objects as much as words and to hold minority  views that are not in keeping with the State’s ideology, and by the State’s co- option of the war machine as a device to oppress the nomad. In the process,  one force is met by another, territory is won or lost, and, as in all wars, there  are consequences for winners and losers. The self-same mechanism of war- fare seems to operate regardless of the particular majority or minority views  involved, and it seems that, rather than a peaceful place, the mechanosphere  </page> <page sequence="10"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  45 is a place of perpetual war. Nor do we have far to look for such a place, as  Randall Allsup reminds us in his study of music education in a time of per- petual war.8  If you have read Ken Follett’s Pillars of the Earth or World without End,  you have seen the war machine at work epistemologically in the way Tom  Builder and his progeny cut stone to lay upon cut stone to erect a massive  cathedral guided not by computer algorithms or theoremic calculations but  by the sense of flow and connectedness and intuitive weighing of forces.  One form of science derived from Plato, Deleuze and Guattari explain, is  called Compars, the legalistic approach to knowing driven by a search for  laws and constants (the way we might go about building a cathedral today);  the other, Dispars, is a nomadic science, “placing . . . variables . . . in a state  of continuous variation”; and, if there are equations, “they are adequations,  inequations, differential equations irreducible to the algebraic form and in- separable from a sensible intuition of variation” (TP, 369; as used by medi- eval masons). Striated space, marked out in metric units and grids, is the  space of Compars; but Dispars takes place in smooth spaces, ungraded and  uncalibrated, and, like the war machine operating against the State, it hides  in the interstices and deviances. The trouble with Compars science is that  it tends to want to remove all intuition and replace it with categories, mak- ing its findings safe and reproducible but not really able to solve problems  “which are tied to a whole set of collective, nonscientific activities” (374).  War machines are of an entirely different composition than imperiums.  They are a force that checks the power of the State, or organized bodies of  knowledge, which, in many respects, are congruent. Calling these counter- forces “war machines” draws attention to the fact that they are foreign forc- es, an “exteriority of thought [that] is not at all symmetrical to the form of  interiority” and “are violent in their acts and discontinuous in their appear- ances,” destroying “every possibility of subordinating thought to a model  of the True, the Just, or the Right” (TP, 376, 377). From the point of view  of the nomad, the disenfranchised, the eccentric, or even the social-change  activist, when often the establishment seems so impenetrable and undefeat- able, the sense that countervailing thought is a war machine with speed and  weapons and mobility can be heartening. Elizabeth Gould, who has written  extensively on how the ideas of Deleuze and Guattari relate to music educa- tion, is hesitant about employing the expression “war machine” but, in the  end, does so but not lightly for this very reason. She explains her choice  this way: “I deploy the war machine to subvert both within and outside  music education disappearance, impoverishment, and exploitation. It is, I  think, that important.”9 This task is critically important; nevertheless, the  actual provenance of the nomad/eccentric/activist is usually characterized  as pacifist, ecofriendly, and prolife, that is, in the sense of being unwarlike  and nonmachinic. The metaphor jars and seems out of place, masculine and  </page> <page sequence="11"> 46  Jorgensen and Yob bellicose, dangerous in the wrong kinds of ways, and antithetical to the kind  of nomadic thinking that the world needs today.  We have spoken of how the model seems to function; but of what is it  comprised and what is its point? The idea of a plateau suggests a relatively  smooth and flat “space” of sustained energy or intensity “between things”  where “things pick up speed” (TP, 25). Here, the interest is in the middle  and not in the ends or particular climactic points—an idea that Deleuze and  Guattari borrow from Gregory Bateson’s analysis of Balinese culture (21).10  Rather than unities in opposition, there are multiplicities in which “each ele- ment ceaselessly varies and alters its distance in relation to the other” (30).  “Multiplicities of multiplicities” form “assemblages” that replace the notion  of unity (34). Boundaries shift, things flow from one stratum to another and  interpenetrate, interior and exterior exchange places, “a new organization  of content and expression, each with its own forms and substances, tech- nological content, symbolic and semiotic expression” emerges, and double  articulations are evident in the resulting abstract machines that “stretch their  pincers out in all directions at all the other strata” (48, 50, 53, 60–61, 63).  “Discursive multiplicities” of expression and “non-discursive multiplicities  of content” intersect (67). Across the various strata, dynamic levels of cau- sation or hierarchies, from “elementary life forms to most complex” (335),  be they “physiochemical, organic, and anthropomorphic” (502), a “plane of  consistency” exists that “knows nothing of differences in levels, orders of  magnitude, or distances” or “the difference between the artificial and the  natural” or “the distinction between contents and expressions or that be- tween forms and formed substances” (69–70). As Buchanan and Swiboda  explain, consistency is evident “in the types of relations a particular sub- stance embodies and the changes that ensue when they enter into relations  with other substances.”11 This smooth space “flattens” distinctions, allows  “reciprocal presuppositions and mutual insertions to play themselves out,”  and represents a “super-linear form”—a rhizome (70, 90, 95). Deterritorial- ization is always double, a flight from territory in which meanings are also  reworked in ways that create a single rhizomatic plane of interconnections  “in simultaneous becoming” (306, 508). Still, Deleuze and Guattari admit  that we cannot escape segmentation: “We are segmented from all around  in every direction” (208). Even though every “multiplicity is transforming  itself,” especially at the “borderline” (and they are interested in the limits of  things; 249, 251), the plane of consistency only “appears to be flat” (251). In  counterpoint to the plane of consistency in which “relations of movement  and rest, speed and slowness” are grasped (266, 267), there is the “plane  of transcendence”—“a teleological plan(e), design, mental principle” that  is “hidden” and “inferred” and “wearing away” at the plane of consistency  and that plays an organizational role (265, 270). One “passes from one plane  to another, from transcendence to imminence” “without being aware of it”  </page> <page sequence="12"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  47 (270). Since each plane enables one to see what is evident on the other plane,  it is necessary to jump from one to the other by means of a “dualism ma- chine” so that what is imperceptible on the one plane becomes perceptible  when one jumps to the other (281, 282, 284).  In recognizing the interplay of these two elements, Deleuze and Guattari  may also be read to require both the arborescent and rhyzomatic models  that are, respectively, formalized, linear, hierarchical, and centralized, on the  one hand, and interconnected, branching, nonhierarchical, and decentral- ized, on the other. Notwithstanding their aversion to duality, dialectic, and  synthesis, rather than an inversion of the arborescent model, maybe they  are really after some amalgamation of the two (TP, 423). Their reluctance  to repudiate arborescent thought entirely, but to work it into their musi- cal model, for example, leads us to wonder if theirs is not a paradigm shift  so much as the search for a broader view that would energize both planes  of consistency and transcendence as current flows between them. Such an  interpretation would be consistent with the double articulations present ev- erywhere else in their thinking. Inconsistencies of this sort lurk across the  philosophical literature and are probably more typical than they are not.12  It seems to us that, read dialectically and even dialogically, the passage be- twixt and between the planes of consistency and transcendence constitutes  a dynamic one in which Deleuze and Guattari’s metaphor of the sea as in  a state of flux, flowing or moving between striated and sedentary spaces to  create smooth or nomadic spaces and “smooth spaces constantly being re- versed and translated into striated spaces” and vice versa is particularly apt  (474, 478). In the end, however, our sense is that, notwithstanding some am- biguity in their ideas, they are really after the creation of smooth, nomadic,  and rhizomatic spaces.  The face is a metaphor full of potential, especially for women, because  the face, particularly the welcoming face of a child’s mother (TP, 169) is one  of the first objects an infant recognizes and responds to. Deleuze and Guat- tari recognize its power and adopt it to represent, in some ways, the very op- posite, for it is our destiny to escape our face (171) and dismantle it (186). It  is one important manifestation of the white wall of significance (where signs  are inscribed) and the black holes of subjectification (in which are lodged  “consciousness and passion,” for instance; 167). Most importantly, the face  is socially produced and takes on an imperialistic demeanor, a politics, pro- duced from a “despotic and authoritarian concrete assemblage of power”  (181). In other words, for Deleuze and Guattari, the face is not an individu- ally constructed persona—what orders and shapes us and makes us appear  as we do is the State and also the Church (172).  This is somewhat reminiscent of the psychoanalytic work of Ana-Maria  Rizzuto who describes how individuals develop a father or God-image that  takes on great significance in how one understands the world and how one  </page> <page sequence="13"> 48  Jorgensen and Yob should live one’s life in it.13 The image in Rizzuto’s sense serves in much  the same way as the face in Deleuze and Guattari’s sense—the source of  authority, control, and identity in one’s life, but where Rizzuto sees this as  individual, our writers see it as collective; and where she sees it as evidence  of positive development as long as the image is a healthy one, they see it  as inevitably limiting and destructive. The tension between the two views  can be instructive: the development of the face may be a normal part of  growing up, yet there may very well come times when that face has to be  challenged and even replaced. But, can an individual live without any face?  Rizzuto would probably say no, which makes us want to turn the question  back to our writers. They would likely give us a different answer, because  their starting point is that the face is inevitably problematic. “The face, what  a horror!” they declare in italics. “It is naturally a lunar landscape, with its  pores, planes, matts, bright colors, whiteness, and holes: there is no need for  a close-up to make it inhuman; it is naturally a close-up, and naturally inhu- man, a monstrous hood” (TP, 190). So, escape from the imperialism of State  and Church, and probably other institutions as well—which is appealing as  a call to freedom and creativity, opening up, as they say, “a rhizomatic realm  of possibility effecting the potentialization of the possible” (190)—means  one becomes faceless, even mandatorily giving up a face of one’s own mak- ing. But that too seems to be inhuman.  Quite aside from the epistemological character of Deleuze and Guat- tari’s model, important political implications are evident, for example, in  notions of territoriality that underpin the tension between State and no- madic thought and practice and the political significance of thought sys- tems. The principle of deterritorialization (emphasized over its polar op- posite territorialization and indicative of Deleuze and Guattari’s preference  for the creation of smooth spaces associated with nomadic thought) plays  out not only in various political and militaristic engagements between State  and nomad but is exemplified in music and art, among other cultural un- dertakings. In short, thought cannot be divorced from political and artistic  implications and the exercise of power. Since the State has co-opted the  nomadic war machine and used it for its own purposes, it is now essential  not only to reclaim the territory lost but to escape the sedentarity and terri- toriality essential to the State’s survival by engaging in rhizomatic thinking  and thereby create spaces and invent ways of seeing between the strictures  of State thought and practice. By creating this alternative milieu, in which  connectedness, multiplicity, and dynamic engagement flourish, one is en- abled to reclaim the means of resisting the State’s oppression. Deleuze and  Guattari may also hope that seeing matters of transcendence and immi- nence differently may constitute a source of empowerment for political as  well as intellectual struggle. </page> <page sequence="14"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  49  Now we come to the case of music. Deleuze and Guittari invoke Sylvano  Bussotti’s “Piano Piece for David Tudor” as the touchstone for how rhizom- atic thought works.14 Buchanan and Swiboda observe that, for Deleuze and  Guittari, music is “a double articulation: it brings together a block of content  (the refrain) and a form of expression (becoming).”15 In Bussotti’s piece, we  see the various characteristics that Deleuze and Guattari postulate for the  “smooth space” that they are after. Here, time serves in a similar role to  space, as a means of rhizomatic thought and practice. Although utilizing  traditional score, with five staves, the performer is given considerable lati- tude to perform the piece unencumbered by measured time, with reference  to differing timbres, intensities, pitches, durations, and other expressive ele- ments. One begins somewhere in the middle, or intermezzo, and presum- ably returns to refrains (ritournelle) that allow the performer to develop  and elaborate even chaotically on motifs or thematic material and thereby  transform them in multiple ways throughout the performance (TP, 312). It is  unclear where the beginning or end of the piece should be in any normative  sense, and the piece’s ambiguity allows for a multiplicity of constructions  in how it should be performed. Presumably, smooth and striated spaces  will interchange throughout the performance of the piece, which has a dy- namic and improvisatory feel. The score serves a suggestive rather than pre- scriptive purpose. The hard boundaries between performer and composer  are softened as the performer assumes one after another roles, just as the  hard boundaries of a regular pulse and mensuration are transformed into a  smooth temporal space that freely flows from one point to the next. Since the  score implicates sounds rather than silences, we are not exactly sure what  the roles of silences are to be in this composition, except as a backdrop to the  sounds the pianist creates. Nor is it clear if there are to be some aspects of  the music that are to be more important than others, save to indicate five ele- ments in each of the staves that seem to assume particular importance. Mul- tiple lines also move diagonally across this nonpulsed time. The score also  suggests “shifting relations” with other expressive elements. Rather than  marking distinct motifs that stake out a musical territoriality, this example  seems more the case of a withdrawal to indistinct motifs that Deleuze and  Guattari would characterize as the deterritoriality of rhizomatic or nomadic  smooth spaces. That many of the markings in the score seem jagged rather  than smooth suggest the intersection of arborescent and rhizomatic models  as old and new come together in a new piece of music. This is a composition  for a solo artist where the claims of coordinating the contributions of other  musicians are not at issue. Still, Bussotti’s piece is open to multiple interpre- tations, transcriptions, and translations; it might be possible to interpret this  piece literally or figuratively, with solo or massed instruments where musi- cians bring their own interpretative characteristics to the performance.16 </page> <page sequence="15"> 50  Jorgensen and Yob Implications for Music Education Notwithstanding the detractions of Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas, we can  rescue several aspects that can contribute positively to our understanding  of music education. Among them, Deleuze and Guattari highlight the “road  less traveled”17 and the importance of the spaces between taken-for-granted  realities. Their approach necessitates a critical engagement with and resis- tance to established beliefs and practices. Certainly, in our time, the arts,  including music, constitute alternative worldviews that are often marginal- ized in the school curriculum and that merit foregrounding more than is  the case in traditional practice. We also see the importance of composing  and improvising as central ways to engage music rhapsodically and infor- mally. In a world of multiplicities as means and ends, grasping connections  between things and viewing them in fresh ways provide opportunities to  enrich all of the musical traditions and processes whereby people come to  know music. This is an active approach to music that engages new technolo- gies and new musics from whichever traditions and pushes the horizons  of musical understandings outward. Not only does it mean constructing  new musical traditions but creating new milieus or communities that form  around these musical expressions.  Such an approach also suggests the importance of grasping minority as  well as majority perspectives in a constant transformative sense of becom- ing. Rhizomatic or hypertextual approaches to musical curriculum enable  access to music from many different points of entry and toward multiple  ends—a view that challenges notions of standardization since the means  and ends of musical instruction are divergent. Engaging with music from  this perspective implies contextual, social, and political approaches that  see music as a part of lived experience rather than divorced from it or that  stress immanence in counterpoint with transcendence. It would also seem  to be impossible to undertake such a musical education without regarding  music subjectively and objectively as expressive and formal construct, and  thereby facilitating those who come to know music to grasp it procedur- ally and propositionally, with reference to its syntactic as well as semantic   elements—to know not only about it but how to do it.  Notwithstanding their potentially positive contributions, we caution that  Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas resonate particularly with two sets of pictures  of music education that Estelle Jorgensen has examined critically in her Pic- tures of Music Education, namely, the Web and connectivity and the seashore  and energy.18 In that writing, she argues that these picture-sets cannot cover  the host of ways in which music education is conducted around the world,  nor do they suffice when taken alone as the sole approach for music edu- cation. Merely substituting one value set for another does not address the  </page> <page sequence="16"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  51 multiplicities of values, ways of regarding music, and approaches to music  teaching, learning, instruction, curriculum, and administration.  The problematic aspects of Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas to which we  have alluded throughout this paper should alert music educators to the pit- falls for music education of following them uncritically. Rather than repu- diate dualities, binaries, polarities, and dialectics, as Deleuze and Guattari  are wont to do, we prefer to see somewhat messy and dynamic pictures  in which the resulting tensions, conflicts, and exclusions may energize mu- sic education as ideas are discussed, debated, and contested in the public  sphere. We are also as interested in the places where we cannot see the con- nections between things as in those in which the connections are evident.  Delusion and disarray can arise when claims are not carefully examined,  when traditional thought and practice are needlessly discarded, and when  visions of a Deleuzian and Guattarian mechanosphere that threatens to ex- tinguish life, turns people into species of machines, and potentially leads to  despair and madness are uncritically accepted. Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas  suggest a particular view of music education that, when taken on its own,  is, in our view, limited, alienating, depressing, and even hopeless. While  we might wish to rescue aspects of their ideas for music education, we are  doubtful that they can suffice as a basis for our own approaches to the phi- losophy of music and general education.  When we focus on the metaphors offered by Deleuze and Guattari, a num- ber of patterns emerges. There is no doubt that the metaphors they employ  are not trivial or superficial. They are large and fundamental and radical.  They are not used merely to expand an idea already formed but seem to be  used more to suggest an idea that further reflection will probe and articulate.  In other words, their metaphors are grounding metaphors, upon which a phi- losophy is built. Because of this, they are difficult to engage, and our writers  themselves use metaphors to comment on metaphors, intertwine metaphors,  and pile metaphors on so deeply that one can scarcely read a page or a para- graph that is not chock full of metaphors, even choking on them. Their ex- planatory power could continue to illumine events and experiences in this  postmodern age, and, once considered, particular metaphors might pop into  mind again and again for their aptness and insight. In this process, they will  either gain more glosses and greater coherence or die for lack of vitality and  aptness. They are also likely to have greater appeal to those who prefer to  engage ideas impressionistically and intuitively, rather than propositionally  and logically, although Deleuze and Guattari suggest they follow a logic (or  illogic) of their own and they are certainly making claims.  Although there are multiple metaphors—and we have only touched on a  few—they share some common threads: becoming, desiring, nonconformity,  difference, dynamism, resistance, eccentricity. These are truly big ideas that  </page> <page sequence="17"> 52  Jorgensen and Yob have yet to penetrate education to any depth, and there has probably never  been a more compelling time to do so when every impulse in educational  organization and policy making is toward setting standards for all to reach  at each step along the way, massification of texts and curricula, and oblitera- tion of the individual teacher and specific learner from the equation.  But we suggest that the roots of these ideas and how they are framed and  where and how they direct us should be examined with the same rigor as  any, and it is our responsibility as philosophers in music education to do so.  Grosz suggests that, before one begins to critique and evaluate, one needs to  enter the work of Deleuze and Guattari with “a kind of trust rarely required  in philosophical texts . . . in order to grasp, to be moved by, and to be able to  utilize their works,”19 and she is probably right. With that in mind, we offer  some critique to preserve what is helpful in their work.  There is a distinctive masculinity about A Thousand Plateaus that should  be acknowledged. We see it in the ways images of bodies and faces are devel- oped and employed, in the mechanistic and belligerent description of differ- ent ideas as “war machines,” the militaristic juxtaposition of difference and  control, images of lines of escape, speed, gaining and losing territory, and so  on. The masculinity of the text is not gender specific, for two men compos- ing a text together are going to express maleness, which does not have to  be problematic; but when feminists of either gender approach the text with  what Elizabeth Schüssler Fiorenza calls “a hermeneutic of suspicion,”20 the  universalizing and totalizing proclamations of A Thousand Plateaus override  the particular and the feminine. It is universal and totalizing in several sig- nificant ways: first, in its description of modernist thinking, it too ignores  the alternative voices of different others that have always been present, even  though rendered largely silent and marginalized; second, in its description of  postmodernist thinking, the “exclusivity of its inclusiveness . . . reproduces  and reconstructs women’s absence” and fails to take into account its own  particularity.21 The mechanistic and militaristic and male-dominated images  are problematic, especially in the sense that they seem to ignore the possibil- ity of an alternative viewpoint. And this is especially surprising given the  agenda of celebrating rhizomatic and nomadic ways of being.  There seems to be a difference between the kinds of thinking Deleuze and  Guattari are speaking for (rich and wide in its compass, open to alternative  ways of thinking and being) and the kind of thinking they employ (spe- cific, bounded, particular). We see this in a number of ways. The rhizome  is proposed; the tap root of Western thought is to be thoroughly uprooted.  The body with organs is dead; the body without organs is alive and full of  potential. Organized and structured knowing and being are condemned; no- madism is celebrated and to be sought. The net result is that positions they  espouse are just as dominating as those they would replace, for only one  view on this has a seat at their table. There is an exclusivity, an in-crowd ver- </page> <page sequence="18"> Deconstructing Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus  53 sus an outsider mentality that is problematic in its narrowness and alarming  in its arrogance. It is ironic that, in an attempt to open up to alterity and  marginality, that which is familiar and central has to be condemned and  replaced with their own view of things.  Our writers recognize a closely related problem: how do you describe an  all-encompassing ontology or epistemology when you must revert to dual- isms? They admit that there are “knots of aborescence in rhizomes, and rhi- zomatic offshoots in roots . . . despotic formations . . . specific to rhizomes,  just as there are anarchic deformations in the transcendent system of trees”  (TP, 20). In endeavoring to talk pluralistically or monistically, one inevitably  lapses into dualisms. This peril is one they acknowledge at the beginning but  do little to ameliorate throughout the text. The dualisms in their account are  not only a “problem of writing” (20), as they put it, an accident of language,  but fundamental to their point. One way of thinking and being is juxtaposed  to another: middles versus beginnings and endings; smooth spaces versus  striated; nomads versus the State; becoming versus resemblance; plateaus  versus culminations and termination points. The “is” of something else is  their “not-is.”  There is a darkness in their work. The lowly rhizome is one of the most  unfortunate-looking plant forms. The nomad is increasingly perceived as  a figure of terror. One needs to slough off one’s face and organs. Ideas are  war machines. This may be the manifestation of the psychoanalytic roots  they share, where the focus is more often on pathologies than health. It may  fulfill a quite deliberate purpose of shocking readers, disturbing their com- placency to draw them into new modes of thought and being. Or it may be  their preferred or accustomed way of viewing the world, a personal pre- disposition to living on the underside. It may be a reflection of a particular  weltanschauung, part of the zeitgeist of postmodernism and a badge of iden- tification. Whatever its origins, this darkness is not something that will have  immediate appeal to many educators, especially those who are drawn to  the task of teaching and guiding the young because they are optimistic and  hopeful about their prospects for success, their students’ futures, and life in  general. At least we can say that Deleuze and Guattari serve as important  correctives to being overly optimistic, especially in their highly significant  contribution of pointing out the limiting and destructive routes that are usu- ally taken.  We notice that Deleuze and Guattari expect few people to find their work  particularly helpful, and they instruct their readers to take whatever por- tions of their work are useful in the living of their own lives. Still, the work  of music education has cultural and social consequences for the conduct of  public policy. Simply taking ideas uncritically a bit here and a bit there of  whatever one likes or believes to be useful cannot satisfy, especially when  it is necessary to think and act collectively in the public sphere. Rather, it  </page> <page sequence="19"> 54  Jorgensen and Yob would seem prudent to subject every view to careful criticism, recognize  the value of multiple perspectives on music education thought and practice,  but, nonetheless, grasp the importance of doing our work in a community of  those whose ideas may differ from our own but whose critical insights can  contribute to our individual and collective work.
