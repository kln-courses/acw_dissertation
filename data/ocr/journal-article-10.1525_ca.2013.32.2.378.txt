<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> WILLIAM SHORT Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics Latin de ̄, both in its prepositional and preverbal form, is characterized by multiple, varied, and seemingly unrelated senses. Unlike proposition-based lexicographical and historical linguistic accounts, an image-schematic definition systematically explains the range of its literal, physical senses and of its figurative, abstract senses, as well as the relations between them. Defining de ̄ in terms of an image-schematic “scenario” portraying two entities connected by a directional trajectory in fact accommodates the co-existence of even antonymous senses within this word’s semantic structure and apparently radical divergences from its presumed essential literal meaning in Latin literature, due to the susceptibility of image schemas to “embodied” transformations such as perspective shifts and profiling effects. De ̄’s more abstract senses may also be linked in this way to widespread metaphorical patterns in Latin, showing that these senses are not haphazard but highly motivated semantically—with significant implications for lexicography, and literary and cultural history. The preposition de ̄, like most prepositions in Latin, is characterized by a high degree of polysemy in both its more concrete and its more abstract senses 1. De ̄ can be used to refer to different types of spatial relations, denoting physical movement “away from” an external point of departure, like ab, or movement “out of” an internal one, like ex. Or it can express the idea of downward motion, as in Irim de caelo misit Saturnia Iuno (“Saturnian Juno sent Iris down from the sky,” Verg. Aen. 9.2). De ̄ can also be used of temporal relations, to indicate that one event takes place subsequent to (“after”) or, more regularly, at a point within (“during”) the course of another: thus de ̄ has a different meaning in diem de die, “day after day” and non bonust somnus de prandio (“a nap after lunch is no good,” 1.

Most. 697) than it has in de vigilia, “by night, in the course of the night” and senatus autem de nocte convenire (“the senate, however, was convening at night,” Quad. Ann. fr. 45 Peter = Macr. Sat. 1.4.18). It can refer to mate- rial composition, property possession or group constituency; to sources, origins, and partitions of all kinds; to group affiliation or kinship relations; to topicality, referentiality, or causality. If the meanings of de ̄’s preverbal form are consid- ered, its field of reference grows even larger to include notions not only of strengthening, completion, and totality, but also of pejoration, cessation, and separation. What to make of de ̄’s multiple and varied meanings, which seem to relate to one another—if at all—only in highly irregular ways? Is this selection of its senses simply arbitrary, and therefore unfathomable, or is it possible to explain its multiplicity of meanings in a unified way? Unlike proposition-based definitions found in historical linguistic (etymological) and lexicographic accounts, which traditionally describe de ̄’s meaning in univocal truth-conditional terms and so cannot (and typically do not even attempt to) explain the relationships between this word’s senses in a systematic fashion, an image-based definition along cognitive linguistic lines suggests the possibility of explaining (not merely describing) the range of its literal, physical senses as well as the particular selection of its figurative, abstract senses, all under a single theory. By characterizing Latin speakers’ understanding of de ̄ in terms of a complex image-schematic scenario, it is in fact possible to accommodate the co-existence of even antonymous senses within its semantic structure, and also seemingly radical divergences from this word’s presumed “essential” literal meaning in Latin literature, due to the susceptibility of image schemas to embodied transformations such as perspective shifts and profiling effects. Because image schemas are open to metaphorical interpretation, recon- structing de ̄’s meaning in such terms permits its more abstract senses to be linked to identifiable patterns of figurative understanding in Latin, showing that these senses are not only not haphazard but instead highly motivated se- mantically: the specific selection of abstract domains in which de ̄ “makes sense” can be explained, in other words, by reference to established meaning structures in Latin, rather than according to some ill-defined notion of tropi- cality. In this way, de ̄ exemplifies cognitive grammar’s theory of “structured polysemy”—that word meaning is organized prototypically, with semantic devel- opment proceeding from original “local” meaning into abstract domains along (often recognizably language- and indeed culture-specific) metaphorical and metonymic pathways2—with significant implications for Latin lexicography, and Roman literary and cultural history. 2. The cognitive linguistic account of polysemy, especially in terms of radial categories, has been developed esp. by Lindner 1982; Lakoff 1987; Brugman 1988; Radden 1989; Pu ̈tz and Dirven 1996; Cuyckens and Radden 2002; and Tyler and Evans 2003. </page> <page sequence="3"> 380 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 I. (RE)DEFINING DE In the tradition of Latin linguistics and lexicography, de ̄’s literal meaning is typically treated as some combination of the senses of “away from” and “out of” with that of “down.” There are two basic theories: According to what can be called the “separation” or “partition” theory, de ̄ encodes what Fitz-Hugh (1897: xxxiv) referred to as the “whence-idea”: Walde and Hofmann (1954: 325), for example, give its meaning as “‘from,’ mostly ‘down from,’” while Ernout and Meillet (1959: 164) explain that “de ̄ . . . signifies the origin, removal, with the added notion of movement from high to low.” Leumann, Hofmann, and Szan- tyr (1972: II, 261), following Wackernagel (1928: II, 209), give its meaning as “‘from’ or ‘in the direction of.’” More recently, de Vaan (2008: 160–61) has claimed its etymological sense to be “(viewed) from here” and Luraghi (2010: 32) states that de ̄ “denotes motion from the vicinity of a landmark.” Latin dictionaries largely follow suit: the OLD lists de ̄’s primary meaning as “indicating removal from a position,” and for Lewis &amp; Short it denotes most basically “the going out, departure, removal, or separating of an object from any fixed point.” Though exhaustively cataloging the contexts in which de ̄ occurs and noting subtle dis- tinctions of sense, the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae nevertheless states its “proper” meaning to be “a leading away, separation, departure.” The opposing theory—the “down” theory—is limited primarily to Fitz-Hugh’s (1907), and then Barton’s (1919), proposal that de ̄ originally signified motion in the direction of gravity, later motion in any direction away from a point. In other words, there is little dis- agreement over the essential semantic features of de ̄—it signifies separation and (sometimes) downward motion—only a question of which is the historically prior sense. Such definitions are clearly inadequate to explain de ̄’s full complement of senses and the relations between them, however. What possible explanation can there be, for instance, of the sense of de ̄ in deligare and devincire (“bind (to- gether)”), where it helps create the sense of narrowing of physical space between two things, if its basic meaning is stipulated to be separation?3 Furthermore, always referring to the domain of spatial relations, if de ̄ marks the point of depar- ture, why does devenire (“reach, arrive at”) differ from its simplex in emphasizing the terminus ad quem, so that it almost corresponds to ire in + acc.? And how does this fit with the sense of de- in deambulare, where it seemingly connotes motion “back and forth,” as suggested by this verb’s use as a translation for Greek 3. This “narrowing” sense of de- in deligare is highlighted also by the typical construction in which this appears, viz. with ad + acc.: cf., e.g., Caes. BG. 1.53, 4.29, 5.9, 5.49; BC. 3.39, 3.40; Liv. AUC. 2.5.6, 8.7.19, 26.13.15; etc. </page> <page sequence="4"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 381 περιπατ ω (e.g., in the Latin Vulgate at Gen. 3:8) or Placidus’s gloss of it as spatium iterare (Gloss. V, 496.3)?4 More abstract senses such as negation, privation, and cessation may perhaps be easily intuited as the notion of removal extended to category defi- nition or event structure, and the pejorative sense of de ̄ in demutare (“change for the worse”), decipere, deludere, deridere, detestari, and so on, can perhaps be understood as separation from a positively valued state of being. And yet de ̄’s senses of intensification, as in deparcus (“excessively sparing”) or de- fessus (“very tired”), and of strengthening, as in demirari (“greatly admire”), demitigare (“greatly soften”), and deosculari (“kiss affectionately”), imply ad- dition or increase in number or intensity and even a “closeness” of conditions, events, or objects. By the same token, if de ̄ refers to the end-state of action in demonstrare, decernere, and dedicare, how can this be squared with its denoting “the origin”? And how does one get from de ̄’s putative partitive sense to that of completeness—as in debellare, deargumentari, defatigare, or even depetigare and deebriatus, where the affix has the sense of “fully, wholly”? Under a theory that treats the semantic features of separation or downward motion as “necessary and sufficient” conditions for applying this term, the co- existence of such contradictory senses in de ̄’s meaning structure can only be regarded as a matter of arbitrary linguistic convention and thus unamenable to (or, perhaps worse, unrequiring of) explanation.5 Equally problematic for these theories are certain idiomatic and literary usages where de ̄’s presumed essential senses of “away from” and “down” appear to be greatly minimized, if not entirely absent. Consider, for example, two typical uses of the formulaic adverbial expression de ̄ tergo: (1) etiam de tergo ducentas plagas praegnantis dabo (“I’d permit two hun- dred teeming lashes on my back as well,” Pl. As. 276); (2) et ecce nobis repente de tergo manipulus armati supercurrit equites (“And behold from behind a company of armed riders overtakes us,” Apul.Met. 9.9). If tergum refers to the back of the (human or animal) body, on any conventional understanding of the preposition de ̄ tergo must mean “(away) from the back.” But in fact the meaning of the expression is just the reverse: it designates the 4. But Cicero (De orat. 2.256) considered this form an example of how de ̄ could be used in compounds without any real semantic value. 5. There is also a more global problem in such accounts. Despite having a strongly psycho- logical orientation that seeks to describe semantic extension in terms of what Bre ́al 1897 called the “the intellectual laws of language (les lois intellectuelles du langage)”—metaphor, metonymy, generalization or specialization—the theory of historical semantics on which they are based does not include any notion of conceptual representation. Even accepting propositional definitions as descriptively adequate, what mental status do we attribute to them? Cf. Geeraerts 2010. </page> <page sequence="5"> 382 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 end-point of the physical motion (the lashes, the arrival of the armed riders), which originates at another location. Similarly, in: (3) miror et innumeris structam de cornibus aram / et de qua pariens arbore nixa dea est (“I marvel at the altar built up from so many horns, and the tree against which the goddess supported herself as she gave birth,” Ov. Her. 21.99–100), the meaning of the preposition includes movement toward and even contact with a location, as in the evoked scene the goddess clearly leans “against” the tree for support, not “away from” it 6. Tertullian’s use of debucinare in Virg. vel. 13, praecipit nihil debucinemus eorum, quae apud illum mercedem merebuntur (“he [sc. God] enjoins us not to trumpet forth any of those things which will merit reward before Him”) similarly appears to emphasize directionality toward a place (cf. TLL V, 115, s.v., “make known by playing the trumpet”). In each of these cases (and many more besides), the required sense of de ̄ appears to be closer to that of ad, though “to(ward)” cannot also be covered under a separation theory that stakes its claim on the sense of “away from. 7” Consider as well expressions such as: (4) etiam si cecidit de genu pugnat (“even if he falls he fights from his knee,” Sen. Dial. 1.2.6); (5) membraque de dura vix sua tollit humo (“he scarcely lifts his own limbs from the hard ground,” Ov. Fast. 2.354); (6) ita properans de sella exsilit (“he [sc. Verres] eagerly leapt up from his chair,” Cic. Verr. 2.2.75), where the action described by pugnat, tollit, exsilit, etc. moves from a physically lower to a physically higher position. In this case, de ̄ must be interpreted in the sense not simply of “from,” but more specifically of “up from.” In the Senecan example, in fact, the sense of upward notion necessarily belongs to the preposition, since it is not specified by the verb or by any other semantic element (in (5), it may possibly be inferred from tollit; in (6), from exsilit). And yet “up” is not normally considered an established sense of de ̄, and would certainly seem to undermine any downward theory of its meaning. Such usages in Latin literature hardly fit, and indeed largely controvert, con- ventional theories of de ̄’s meaning, so that they must either be ascribed to wholly pragmatic factors or, more drastically, eradicated editorially. In fact, despite the unanimity of the manuscript tradition,8 many editors have preferred to follow Fuss (1865) and Palmer (1898) in emending the Ovidian line (3) from de qua to te qua, perhaps feeling that for the required reading of de ̄ to deviate so greatly 6. As Torsellino, De particulis Latinis = Hand 1863: 194 remarks, “no one sane would ever say ‘to give birth from a place (von einem Orte aus geba ̈hren).’” 7. See Brachet 2000: 33–60 for extensive discussion of de ̄’s “directive” sense. 8. It is an admittedly meager tradition. Only three 15th c. ce codices and some early Italian printed editions preserve Heroides 21.13–144: see Tarrant 1983. </page> <page sequence="6"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 383 from its accepted meaning is even less likely than the unexpected apostrophe introduced by te 9. Meanwhile, explanations based on processes like “contextual modulation” or “contextual selection”—interpretive processes by which specific meaning is given to an ambiguous word, determined or “activated” within specific (textual or extralinguistic) contexts—would simply be unworkable: these depend overridingly on hyponymic relations (e.g., English monarch can be interpreted either as “king” or as “queen”), whereas in the case of de ̄ it is impossible to posit any realistic higher order concept that covers both “up” and “down” or both “toward” and “away from.” Indeed, probably the only way to bring all this word’s spatial senses under a single definition would be to suggest that they share the semantic feature of motion—but de ̄ would be reduced thereby to a category of such generality as to be essentially meaningless. An alternative might be to posit some kind of homonymy (or even a multiplicity of homonymies), as Kent (1967: 160) did for the preposition in “into” and the negative prefix in- “not,” but that would be problematic historically, as de ̄ and de- are clearly related (cf. Baldi 1999: 359).10 An “image-schematic” definition of de ̄, on the other hand, suggests the possi- bility of a unified account of its meaning, based on known properties of the human cognitive system. In cognitive semantics, an image schema is a highly abstract structure of cognition that emerges through human perceptual and sensory-motor interaction with the world—as Mark Johnson (1987: xiv) writes, “a recurring dynamic pattern of our perceptual interactions and motor programs that gives coherence and structure to our experience 11.” Many image schemas are analogs of visual perception, i.e., “schematic images, such as trajectories or long, thin shapes, or containers” (Lakoff 1987: 113–14). Others are more abstract mental representations deriving from the character of human bodily experience, such as up/down schemas, center/periphery schemas and movement schemas. Though such schemas are frequently referred to (and function as) as “gestalt structures,” 9. Kenney 1996: 228–29 adopts this reading on the grounds that the repetition of de ̄ in quite different senses is “awkward” and also because “O[vid] is fond of apostrophe, which here reflects the special awe attaching to this holiest of relics.” But the kind of antanaclasis produced by repetition of the preposition—referring first to material composition and then to spatial motion—differs only by degrees from Ovid’s typical use of this figure. And the change simply substitutes one exceptional case for another: Cydippe’s break into direct address, while not unparalleled (cf., e.g., Her. 16.162, flamma rogi flammas finiet una meas; Met. 1.720, Arge iaces, quodque in tot lumina lumen habebas exstinctum est), would seem to demand special pleading in superimposing an uncommon rhetorical device on an equally uncommon syntactic construction—the incorporation of an antecedent vocative into a relative clause. Arguments that niti de is modeled off of pendere de—often supported by reference toHom. Hymn. to Apollo 14–18—are unconvincing. The Greek text in fact reads κεκλιμ νη πρ ς μακρ ν  ρος, (“leaning toward a great tree,” 17), suggesting that Ovid’s de actually corresponds to πρ ς. Moreover, if Ovid had pendere in mind, the more typical construction would have been with the simple ablative or with ex + abl. 11.

While not denying the part of propositional knowledge in certain aspects of language and thought, they argue, moreover, that in providing non-finitary, pre-conceptual structures that are imageable and thus susceptible of visual and kinesthetic “transformations” in mental space—rotation, scanning, clustering or segmentation, superimposition, path or end-point focus, following a trajectory, reflexivity, and so forth (Gibbs and Colston 1995)—image schemas also provide the inferential patterns that motivate the range of senses typically characterizing the meanings of words.13 As I see it, de ̄’s meaning is constituted by a TR structurally complex, but imagistically minimal LM1 LM2 scenario combining multiple image schemas to portray two bounded entities and directed mo- Figure 1, image schematic scenario tion between these two entities. In cognitive constituting the meaning of dē linguistic terms, the scenario is composed of a “trajector” (a dynamic focal or foreground entity) whose imagined motion traces a path from one “landmark” (static background entity) to a second landmark.14 This can be represented graphically as in Figure 1, where the symbol tr indicates the trajector; lm1 and lm2 indicate the two entities or landmarks; and the arrow indi- cates that the trajector’s motion is directional between these landmarks. Although given horizontal spatial orientation in this diagram, as a schematic structure of understanding this scenario should be taken as non-deterministic in respect to the topological arrangement of the elements as well as to the trajector’s directionality; moreover, the spatial nature of the elements should not be taken as predetermined: though deriving from experiences of physical motion, the schema provides a kind of template for understanding all sorts of relations (including spatial relations, of course) according to a defined conceptual “shape 15.” Evoked in mental space (i.e., pictured “in the mind’s eye”), the scenario also, I suggest, entails inherent perspectivization, as if viewed from the vantage-point of an observer who correlates probably in all cases to the thinking subject. In what 12. Studies show image schemas deliver the meanings of many lexical forms (e.g., of the modal verbs and prepositions in English: Sweetser 1990; Lakoff 1987) as well as provide structure to abstract thinking, reasoning, and the imagination (e.g., Johnson 1987). 13. Not only of words, however (cf. Talmy 1988): Nikiforidou 1991 has argued that the different senses of the genitive case in Greek, for example, develop from a central notion of “possession” through metaphor and other image-schematic transformations. 14. On “trajector” and “landmark,” see esp. Langacker 1999: 9. 15. The figures given here are meant to help clarify the schematicity of image schemas, not to imply anything about their cognitive representation. On the analog nature of image schemas, see Brugman and Lakoff 1988. For their possible cognitive representation, see Hampe and Grady 2005; Gibbs 2006. </page> <page sequence="8"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 385 is perhaps the prototypical construal of this image-schematic scenario, the scene’s presupposed vantage point corresponds to a point of view spatially opposite the region from which the trajector’s motion originates (lm1), so that the trajector is normally understood as moving toward the observer/thinker, whose position corresponds to the landmark of destination (lm2). Hence conventional spatial meanings of de ̄ in which the preposition designates the source point of some thing as it moves closer to the position of the observer, as, e.g., in: (7) multi obviam prodierunt de provincia decedenti (“Many came out to meet him [sc. L. Murena] as he departed from his province,” Cic. Mur. 68). (8) miramur istum de provincia decedentem clam Syracusis profugisse? (“Are we surprised that he [sc. Verres] fled from Syracuse in secret on his way back from the province?” Cic. Ver. 2.1.113). (9) num etiam de matris hunc complexu . . . vobis inspectantibus avellet atque abstrahet? (“Shall he [sc. Indutiomarus] still tear and drag away this man from the embrace of his mother . . . while you are looking on?” Cic. Font. 21). The same holds true, of course, even as the preposition includes the notion of downward motion: cf., e.g., (10) illa autem virgo atque altera itidem ancillula de navi timidae desu- luerunt in scapham (“The young girl and a similarly young fellow slave- girl, terrified as they were, managed to leap down from the ship into the lifeboat,” Pl. Rud. 75). Again, in all such cases the preposition implies not one, but two regions— the origin of the trajector’s motion as well as its destination—with the ob- server’s/thinker’s point of view aligned most closely with the latter. Importantly, as a partial analog of visual perception, the scenario may undergo vantage-point shifts to be construed from a perspective correlating to the region of the trajector’s origin (lm1), so that the motion is seen as being in a direction away from the observer/thinker. Take the devotio prayer that Ennius attributes to Decius Mus at the Battle of Ausculum, for example: (11) pro Romano populo prognariter armis certando prudens animum de corpore mitto (“Out of my body I send my spirit by fighting steadfastly in arms for the Roman people,” Ennius apud Non. p. 150, 6 = Enn. Ann. 5.216 Vahlens). Here, the preposition captures the point of view of the general himself, whose body (corpus) functions as the landmark of origin for the moving trajector, his spirit (anima). De ̄ is similar in this respect to contra, the meaning of which, as Ekberg (2004: 39–40) argues, can vary on the basis of vantage-point shifts over an image-schematic scenario portraying two trajectors meeting at a center point (i.e., tr1 tr2): so alongside contra’s regularly occurring “against” senses can also be found its more peripheral “back” senses—e.g., what the OLD gives as “in return, by way of recompense” or “the reverse of”; cf. contrarius, “reverse”—when the default perspective corresponding to the origin point of tr1 </page> <page sequence="9"> 386 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 has shifted to tr2. With de ̄, very often the trajector actually corresponds to the observer/thinker: thus, when Sosicles feigns madness in Plautus’s Menaechmi to escape punishment by “his” (actually his brother’s) father-in-law and proclaims, (12) sed quis hic est qui me capillo hinc de curru deripit? (“But what person is this tearing me by the hair down from the chariot? Pl. Men. 870), the preposition indicates the region serving as the origin of motion of a trajector that maps to Sosicles himself. Similarly, in Cicero’s description of the confiscation of the property of Epicrates in the Verrines, the orator recounts that Epicrates “believed it better to depart secretly from the province” (commodissimum putavit esse de provincia clam abire, Cic. Ver. 2.2.55) than to tangle with Verres and his henchman—where the preposition again signifies the landmark of origin for a trajector that corresponds to the thinking subject. De ̄’s inherent specification of both the region of the trajector’s origin and the region of its destination, as well as its built-in perspectivization, may help explain why in otherwise apparently very similar linguistic contexts, Latin speakers prefer this preposition to either e(x) or ab, whose meaning it overlaps in some senses. This is not the place to trace the gradual encroachment of de ̄, through the history of Latin, on the meaning of these prepositions—so that in Late and Medieval Latin de ̄ takes possession of nearly the entire field 16. But it is illuminating to put certain instances of classical usage side by side. Take, for example, the passage of Plautus’s Menaechmi cited above (12): sed quis hic est qui me capillo hinc de curru deripit? (870) which may be compared with a fragment of Cicero’s De republica preserved by Nonius: (13) ut auriga indoctus e curru trahitur, opteritur, laniatur, eliditur (“as an untrained driver is dragged from his chariot, trampled, lacerated, crushed,” Cic. Rep. 2.68 = Non. p. 292M). What I suggest accounts for the use of de ̄ in the Plautine passage but e(x) in the Ciceronian passage—otherwise so syntactically and lexically similar—is that de ̄ necessarily portrays to the imagination a scene in which both the origin and destination of the trajector’s movement are conceptually salient. Furthermore, in (12), the focus of the evoked scene is on the violence of the action as experienced by the speaker who, corresponding to the trajector, now finds himself in a new position, the region of destination captured lexically by hinc. In (13), on the other hand, the focus of meaning is on the original position of the unskilled charioteer (viz., his chariot): the point is that the chariot driver is “out of” his chariot as a result of his ineptitude (the passive voice in trahitur, opteritur, etc. emphasizes this lack of agency); where he ends up as a result of this movement is quite immaterial. Because the image schema underlying ex (as illustrated by Figure 2; cf. Luraghi 2003: 95–96 on Greek  κ/  ), unlike that of de ̄, does not include as part of its semantic specification the region of the trajector’s destination and 16. Mantello and Rigg 1996: 87; Harrington 1997: 26–27. </page> <page sequence="10"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 387 consequently conceptually hides or downplays this aspect of the imagined scene, ex is felt as maximally fitting the speaker’s construal of the situation. What if e(x) were replaced by de ̄ in (13)? The resulting expression *auriga de curru trahitur TR LM1 seems to imply another landmark serving as the region of destination: de ̄, that is, seems to naturally demand “to where?” This impression Figure 2, image schema seems to be confirmed by other instances where underlying the meaning of ex the usage of de ̄ again appears to be motivated by an image in which the motion of a trajector occurs between two distinguishable and conceptually salient landmarks, e.g.: (14) non [admonebat] virgo illa Vestalis Claudia quae patrem complexa triumphantem ab inimico tribuno plebei de curru detrahi passa non est? (“Did not that vestal virgin Claudia recur to your mind, who embraced her father while celebrating his triumph, and prevented his being dragged from his chariot by a hostile tribune of the people?” Cic. Cael. 34); (15) rex equos immisit et rota pedem eius oppressit; Oedipus iratus inscius patrem suum de curru detraxit et occidit (“The king gave his horses free rein and drove over his foot with the chariot-wheel; in ignorance Oedipus angrily dragged his own father from the chariot and killed him,” Hyg. Fab. 67.3). In these examples, de ̄ rather than ex is used because the evoked scene that the preposition partially captures includes a specified second location functioning as the region of the destination and corresponding to the position of the person responsible for the trajector’s movement from region to the other (the tribune, Oedipus). Perhaps little of what has been said so far is controversial. Indeed, that de ̄’s meaning includes not only the notion of two distinct regions and of motion between these regions, but also the built-in point of view of an imagined observer, was already pointed out by Orazio Torsellino in his 16th-century treatise on the Latin particles, when he wrote: “De ̄ properly indicates motion, which we follow as it proceeds from some place . . . For in de ̄ we follow the motion, as if leading something to another place in such a way that the connection which exists between the place whence the motion takes place, and the moved thing, is not entirely eliminated 17.” And also: “The proper force of this preposition is to indicate the departure of something together with connection (exitum rei una cum nexu) to the place where the moved thing formerly rested.” Furthermore, Jean- Paul Brachet (2000) has recently studied de ̄’s preverbal form, suggesting that it signifies “un «de ́part vers» ‘’ or “un ablatif centripe`te” (15)—that is, departure 17.

In explaining how de- acquired this “ablative” signification when its Indo-European root, the particle *de/do, had, instead, a strictly “directive” sense, Brachet even invokes a notion of perspectivization similar to the one articulated above, to argue that this “inversion se ́mantique” came about because of recurrent syntactic collocation of de ̄-compounds with prepositional phrases with ab and ad, where “le point de vue sur le de ́placement de ́crit par de ̄- s’est modifie ́” (67). What, then, distinguishes the image-schematic account I have proposed from these analyses, in particular Brachet’s? Above all, it is Brachet’s express purpose not to try to identify a prototypical, central meaning (Grundbedeutung) for de ̄, but to “reconstituer des evolutions” and “mettre au jour des emplois propres” of the preverbal form alone (18). In fact, Brachet excludes from consideration the meanings of the preposition, which differ, in his view, in being principally “ablative”—a difference that leads him to conclude that preposition and preverb must be considered discrete categories with “existences inde ́pendantes” (see esp. 373–74). It is for this reason that, even as he provides a thoroughgoing review of de-’s “abstract” senses—its “assignatory” function, indicating that the action of a verb is directed at someone (as in dedicare or devovere); its “delimiting” function, indicating the boundary of some action (delimitare, depalare); certain “aspectual” functions, such as signifying the completeness (debellare, decoquere) or inversion (descendere, dediscere) of an action; and so on—Brachet makes no attempt to account for what motivates these abstract interpretations. De- in decoquere or debellare may indicate that the action or event is viewed as “un proce`s . . . dirige ́ vers un terme” (108), but why should actions and events be viewed in such terms in the first place? Relatedly, while Brachet describes his study as going “par ordre d’abstraction croissante” (16), the lack of any real theory of literality or figurativeness results in an account that has the character more of a simple congeries of arbitrary denotations than of a humanly meaningful concept. My claim, by contrast, is that precisely because of the nature of image schemas as embodied representations of sensory and spatial experience, an image- schematic account of de ̄ makes possible a unitary, principled explanation that holds for potentially all of the preposition’s meanings in context, as well as those of the preverb. In positing de ̄’s central meaning to be an image-schematic scenario of a certain structure, I claim that the links between its basic spatial sense and its many extended senses (including its highly abstract figurative senses) are not only natural but also independently motivated: natural, in the sense that they emerge naturally from the character of the human cognitive system; motivated, because they are based on metonymic or metaphorical understandings that can be shown to exist independently in Latin speakers’ conceptual system. In other words, I believe it is possible to explain—in the sense of “provide a motivated account of”—the polysemy of de ̄ both as preposition and preverb, both synchronically and diachronically, on the basis of a limited number of cognitive construal operations and specific structures of figurative meaning that manifest themselves regularly in Latin’s semantic system. In particular, I suggest that, along with vantage- </page> <page sequence="12"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 389 point shifts that modify the scenario’s inherent perspectivization, changes of de ̄’s sense arise from what Ronald Langacker (2008) calls “profiling effects”— salience shifts over the image-schematic scenario that bring about modifications in the relative cognitive foregroundedness or backgroundedness of its different elements 18. Conceptual profiling is a general feature of cognition (and so of mental imagery) and is akin to figure/ground organization in visual perception (Rubin 2001): profile shifts can be likened to “depth of field” effects achievable with photographs or computer images, only the shifts here do not involve changes in relative visual clarity but in relative conceptual prominence. As Langacker (2008: 66) explains, any mental image serving as the mean- ing of an expression can be described in terms of a conceptually foregrounded “profile” and conceptually backgrounded “base”: “As the basis for its meaning, an expression selects a certain body of conceptual content. Let us call this its conceptual base. Construed broadly, an expression’s conceptual base is identified as . . . the portion put ‘onstage’ and foregrounded as the general locus of viewing attention. Within this onstage region, attention is directed to a particular substruc- ture, called the profile.” Consider two examples of “profiling” in the semantic system of English: the word spoke (“bar or rod connecting the center of a wheel to its outer edge”) and the names of the days of the week. It is only possible to understand what a spoke, rim, or hub is against conventional knowledge of what a wheel is like (that is, wheel constitutes the base for the meaning of spoke, rim, and hub, while spoke, rim, and hub profile certain portions of the concept wheel, which is itself profiled by the word wheel). Similarly, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so forth, only make sense given knowledge of the seven-day week, which functions as their common base and of which they profile different portions. In these cases, different lexical items profile—that is, make conceptually salient—different aspects of the underlying base (66–67). In the case of Latin de ̄, a single lexical item includes alternative profile configurations, its sense varying with changes in the cognitive saliency of the elements within its underlying image schema 19. In the image-schematic scenario that constitutes the meaning of de ̄, the region of the origin normally receives mental focus (i.e., is more mentally salient), as represented in Figure 3a. TR LM1 LM TR 2 LM1 LM2 Figure 3a, dē, profiling the region of Figure 3b, dē, profiling the region of the trajector’s origin destination The solid line designates the region of origin (lm1) as the cognitively foregrounded or “profiled” element, while the region of the destination (lm2 forms part of the 18.

However, the region of the trajector’s destination may sometimes be cognitively foregrounded, as in Figure 3b. Grammatically speaking, de ̄ can then be said to pick out the profiled landmark of the scenario, irrespective of whether this landmark serves, within the imagined scene, as the origin or destination of the trajector’s motion. The backgrounded (non-profiled) landmark, meanwhile, remains semantically implied but lexically and grammatically unspecified. II. SPATIAL SENSES As has been seen, even confined to the single domain of spatial relations, de ̄ can have a range of senses and connotations, referring to movement “out of,” “away from,” or “down from” relative to a specified place as well as, absolutely, movement that goes “back and forth” in one place; movement between two objects or entities; and even movement toward an endpoint. Incorporating shifts of cognitive salience into de ̄’s meaning structure permits us not only to clarify why Latin speakers can use de ̄ in what appear to be wholly contradictory ways, but also certain uses of the word, inexplicable on traditional feature-based definitions of the word, where “toward” and “up” better characterize the required interpretation. Take, for instance, the semantic value of de- in compounds such as deligare and devincire, where the preposition appears to contribute the sense of “together” or “closeness” to the root’s sense of “tying” or “binding” (*li’g-, *uink-). This meaning comes out especially in examples such as Auson. 325.60, Amorem devinctum post terga manus; Cels. 6.8.10, cruribus inter se devinctis and Liv. AUC. 2.5.6, stabant deligati ad palum; Hyg. Fab. 144, (Prometheum) ad saxum clavis ferreis deligatum, where its function is to express the narrowing of physical space between two lexically specified entities or objects. Narrowing appears, however, to be opposed to the notion of separation that is supposed to be a distinctive feature of de ̄’s meaning. Still, under an image-schematic account, it is not difficult to see how both senses might develop from the underlying scenario, since this scenario includes the specification of two bounded entities and directed motion between these two entities. The sense of separation emerges when conceptual focus falls on only one of the two landmarks (the region of origin), the other (the region of destination) remaining, as it were, “backgrounded” within the imagined scene. The narrowing sense emerges when the conceptual focus is on the motion itself as it occurs between the two landmarks: the profiled trajector, in completing its path of motion between the two imagined regions, effectively brings the two landmarks into connection. Something similar can be said for de ̄’s meaning in deambulare, where, however, instead of one or the other element coming to be foregrounded, a dynamic shift of conceptual emphasis between these elements predominates: in this case, the landmarks alternately receive focal prominence (as when the eye focuses by turns on adjacent objects), yielding the sense of motion that runs </page> <page sequence="14"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 391 “back and forth.” And consider again de ̄ tergo: I have already suggested that if de ̄ refers to the position in space “away from” which some motion takes place, then this expression must mean “away from the back”: that is, the expression must have the meaning that is represented graphically in Figure 4a. But, as we have seen, the expression is instead conventionally used in precisely the opposite meaning, that is, to designate the region of destination of some physical motion which originates at another location, and which is viewed as directed toward the speaker/thinker. And consider again Ovid’s expression de . . . arbore nixa in (3); the verb niti, in its spatial sense—“lean, support oneself (on); kneel (against)”—normally takes the simple ablative, or in + acc. or abl., or genitive of place.20 Thus, in this hapax legomenon with de ̄, the preposition requires a contextual reading—specifying the region of destination of the pregnant Latona’s leaning movement—that is completely at odds with its conventional understanding.21 Figure 4a, de tergo on Figure 4b, de tergo on conventional reading of dē image schematic reading Both uses (de tergo and de . . . arbore indicating the end-point of the motion) fall easily under the image-schematic definition of de ̄ I have proposed, however: as schematized in Figure 4b, in these instances the preposition profiles the landmark—the back (tergum), the tree (arbor)—serving as the destination of the trajector’s movement (lm2) within the imagined scenario, a shift in conceptual emphasis that, at the semantic level, gives de ̄ a sense more like “toward.” Naturally, what motivates the selection of the region of destination as the profiled element differs in each case: in the Ovidian passage, a stylistic consideration—the structural and phonic repetition in de cornibus . . . de qua—determines the usage of the preposition in this marginal (but image-schematically regular) sense. In the case of de tergo, on the other hand, the essentially egocentric and anthropomorphic character of human spatial thinking 22, as well as the nature of human embodied experience, likely brings about the shift in conceptual emphasis: having the kind of body we do, with its particular posture, orientation, and “topology,” we view 20. Cf., e.g., Verg. Aen. 6.760, iuvenis qui nititur hasta, Ov. Ep. ex Pont. 1.8.52, baculo nixus; cf. Sen. Clem. 2.6.3; Caes. BG. 2.27.2, scutis innixi, etc.; Verg. Aen. 12.398, nixus in hastam; Plin. NH 7.182; Cic. Har. resp. 60, nixa in umeris; and Verg. Aen. 2.380, humi nitens. 21. See Nutting 1930: 169–92. 22. Clark 1973 argues that the ego- and anthropocentric set of coordinates (as in English left, right, front, back) is likely universal in languages due to its (presumed) centrality to human spatial thinking; but see now Levinson and Wilkins 2006 for a revised view based on cross-cultural data. </page> <page sequence="15"> 392 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 ourselves as having a defined “front” and “back,” and so physical movement perceived as directed toward the (plane of the) back is understood to come “from” the back toward the self, which corresponds conceptually to the front of the body 23. The same image-schematic understanding of de ̄ that can accommodate both the sense of “away from” and the sense of “toward, against” also accommodates the sense of “up(ward)” as well as that of “down(ward).”24 In cases such as de genu(/ibus), de sella, de humo or terra, and so forth, the sense of the preposition simply depends on shifts in the spatial configuration of the underlying imagined scenario, in particular the configuration of the foregrounded landmark—the one, as always, designated by de ̄—in respect to the backgrounded landmark. Because the image schema offers to the imagination a mental scene that is neutral in respect to the topological arrangement of its constituent elements, it can undergo modifications that bring about a vertical (rather than a horizontal) alignment of the landmarks—so that, always varying with the scene’s spatial configuration, the preposition can be interpreted either in the sense of “down from” (when the profiled landmark is spatially “above” the backgrounded landmark) or in the sense of “up from” (when the profiled landmark is “below” the backgrounded landmark). Such interpretations follow naturally from the character of the image schema, which is both schematic (that is, configurationally underdetermined yet also constrained) and embodied (that is, subject to transformations in mental space that are grounded in, and analogous to, human perceptual and bodily experiences). III. EXTENDED SENSES Is it possible to account for de ̄’s many abstract senses, which cover an almost dizzying number of domains of reference (including referentiality itself), under the same image-based definition? An important aspect of image schema theory suggests it is: that image schemas can also be (and typically are) metonymically and metaphorically interpreted, extending the meaning of words further into abstract domains (Lakoff 1987). Moreover, as numerous studies of image-schematically defined terms (primarily in English, but now in other modern and ancient languages) have borne out, cognitive semantics suggests that such extensions do not occur randomly, but rather follow regular patterns of figurative meaning.25 For instance, Brugman (1988) and Brugman 23. Cf. Bra ̈hler and Appelt 1986. This effect likely also accounts for the “locational” (rather than “source”) meaning of ab in ab tergo, which means “at the back” rather than “far from the back”: Luraghi 2010: 27. 24. In this light, there is little reason to claim that Latin de ̄ differs etymologically from Greek -de and other similar forms in Old Church Slavonic, Baltic and Germanic that express the notion of motion towards (“to”) (cf. Bonfante 1950: 108). The development of PIE *de in Italic (and Celtic) is simply atypical (cf. Pinkster 1972: 145–52) in having a default profile configuration in which the region of origin is conceptually highlighted. 25. E.g., Sweetser 1990; Nerlich et al. 2003; and Luraghi 2003. </page> <page sequence="16"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 393 and Lakoff (1988) have shown that the relations between the different senses of “over” in English can be described in terms of transformations over a central image-schematic sense that comprises aspects of “above” and “across”: thus, the difference between “Sam walked over the hill” and “Sam lives over the hill” is accounted for by the “path to end-of-path” transformation, while the difference between “There are potholes all over this road” and “I spilled coffee over the table” is due to the “multiplex to mass” transformation. Furthermore, English speakers’ understanding of (emotional) states in terms of locations (cf. Ko ̈vecses 2003) motivates the use of “over” in “I’m so over him” or “I just can’t get over him,” where the speaker views herself metaphorically as having “gotten beyond” (or not!) a certain state of emotional commitment; over’s senses of “more than” and “again,” meanwhile, depend respectively on the metaphors “more is up” and “activities are journeys,” both pervasive in English.26 Accordingly, it should be possible to show that the selection of abstract domains of reference in which de ̄ can be interpreted does not arise haphazardly, but is motivated (not to say determined) by higher order structures of metonymical and metaphorical meaning that operate across the Latin lexicon. Certain of de ̄’s extended senses are clearly and directly related to its literal spatial senses by metonymic reasoning. So, whereas in contemporary life (with credit cards, automated electronic bank drafts, and now mobile money transfers) we probably no longer conceive of monetary payments as made “from” or “out of” a place, when Latin speakers used de ̄ to indicate the funding source from which the cost of any thing was taken, for example—as in Cic. Ver. 5.45, de tua pecunia aedificatam esse navem—they no doubt had inmind a physical location, so that the sense of 2“at one’s own expense 7” depends on a metonymy in which the “contents” substitutes for the “container.” This seems to be confirmed by semantically parallel expressions such as de suo, tuo, meo, publico, etc., in which a word like fisco or aerario, denoting a physical place where monies are kept, has clearly been elided. But in experience payments are also simultaneously understood as being made to someone, and thus de ̄ (rather than ab or ex), in portraying two entities connected by a directional trajector, closely fits the schematic structure of such experience, which specifies a seller and a buyer, as well as the exchange of goods and money that links them together (cf. the usual syntax of emere aliquid de aliquo).28 Similarly, when Latin speakers use de ̄ to indicate the material of which some thing is composed, they rely on a metonymy by which material composition is also conceived in spatial terms—quite naturally, since experience teaches us that substances exist in space, and the creation of objects frequently involves their 26. For a discussion of linguistic and other behavioral manifestations of these metaphors, see Lakoff and Johnson 1980 and Radden 2003. 27. The same metonymy operates in English, where it is possible to speak of someone paying “out of pocket” even when writing a check or conducting electronic bank transactions. 28. That is, the structure of the image schema underlying de ̄ is easily superimposed on the structure of the prototypical commercial event frame: see Fillmore 1982: 116–17. </page> <page sequence="17"> 394 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 separation or differentiation from a larger mass of material (so, for instance, an amphora is perceived as made “out of” a lump of clay, a fibula “out of” a piece of bronze). Again, the image-schematic scenario underlying de ̄ (more than that of ex or ab), which portrays a trajector moving from one place to another, matches the structure of experience, in which created objects (amphorae, fibulae) are perceived as proceeding, materially and spatially, from an “origin” to a “destination.” Usage of de- in the sense of “cessation,” “negation,” or “reversal” (referring to an action) can also be explained in terms of this image-schematic scenario, given that in general circumstances and events are portrayed figuratively in Latin in terms of locations (cf. evenire in the sense of “happen, come about,” eventus in the sense of “occurrence, situation”; circumstantia; status, and so on). Since often in human experience the undertaking or completion of a specific act is contingent on its being performed in a particular location or in respect of some particular localized object, an action that is seen as moving “away from” or “out of” this required circumstance can be understood as “ceasing” to be a part of that circumstance. If this movement is complete, the action is viewed as “negated” (no longer part of the circumstance). Transformation effects also come into play. De ̄’s “privative” sense arises when the landmarks are instead interpreted as states of being, conceptual focus normally falling on the region—that is, the state—of origin, with the trajector seen as being “away from” this state: cf. Ov. Ars 2.564, Mars . . . de duce terribili factus amator erat as well as demens, dearmatus, debilis, etc. The meaning of decalvus—“(made) bald” when we might have expected “not bald”—may then be due to conceptual focus shifting to the region of destination, so that again de- highlights, metaphorically, the end-state of some action. Other extended senses of de ̄ may depend on more elaborate figurative un- derstandings, often in interaction with culturally situated meanings. Genealogical and kinship relationships are likely signified by de ̄ because of cultural beliefs about “genetic” inheritance as well as social practices relating to the represen- tation of family structure. As Mario Lentano (2007) has shown, Roman beliefs about sexual reproduction center around the notion that (male) children take part in their father’s bodily makeup, by receiving (in a very concrete way) a share of his blood.29 At the same time, visual representations of (aristocratic) fami- lies in the form of the stemma convey relationships between the founder on top and the generations of his descendants below, by strings or ribbons linking them physically in a sort of vertical network (see Bettini 1991). Moreover, Roman families tended to occupy the same physical spaces (as Dupont 1992: 103–106 has shown, the ideal form of the Roman family brought together three generations of men under one roof) and were closely identified with the physical space of the domus: a family was not only the collection of its members, but the place(s) these individuals jointly inhabited as such (so domus also denotes the members of the household: cf. Cic. Att. 4.12, domus te nostra tota salutat). In this sense, 29. See also Guastella 1985, Mencacci 1986, Beltrami 1998 and Bettini 2009a. </page> <page sequence="18"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 395 to speak of someone in Latin as being de genere, de stirpe, de gente, etc. is to rely on a complex configuration of bodily, visual and spatial images, which easily map to the structure of the scenario that constitutes the meaning of de ̄. Consider, too, Latin speakers’ usage of de ̄ in reference to time, in basically two senses: “(directly) after” and, more commonly, “during.” No doubt, such usage is motivated by their metaphorical understanding of time in spatial terms: as Bettini (1991: 121–33) has pointed out, expressions of time in Latin reveal that meaning in this domain is organized by related images of physical motion along a path: expressions such as tempus veniet (Verg. Geo. 1.493), anni venientes (Hor. Ars 175), and tempora labuntur (Ov. Fast. 6.771) reflect a horizontal model of temporal progression, in which distinct events in time are understood as objects that move towards the speaker, who occupies a fixed location (when speaking about temporal processes in which the subject’s role is viewed as somehow passive); temporal progression can also be understood as the subject’s own movement in relation to fixed locations (events) along the path of time (when the subject is viewed as more actively involved). De ̄’s sense of “after” can therefore be explained as a consequence of viewing two event-locations in respect of their relative positions in temporal space: in the perspective of a “subject who moves toward his own future,” any event-location (lm2) that is perceived to be “away from” another (lm1) (that is, at a point further along the path of time) will be understood as occurring “after” it. (If the mental image is rotated so that the linear configuration of the event-locations is inverted—and thus, metaphorically, their temporal relationship—an action or event can be seen as “reversed,” as in decrescere or dediscere.) On the other hand, the sense of “during” emerges when the two landmarks specified by the preposition are interpreted as marking the start- and end-points of a single durative circumstance, the action (corresponding to the trajector that moves from the region of origin to the region of destination) thus understood as occurring “within” this temporal extent. Turning to de ̄’s more abstract senses, we have already seen that the prepo- sition’s sense of “negation” emerges when the landmarks of the image-schematic scenario are interpreted as events or states of being, and when the movement of the trajector between these landmarks is viewed as completed, so that the trajector now exists in a different state of being—and therefore not in the previous state. If the scenario can be interpreted in this way, however, how is it possible for de ̄ also to have the sense of “completeness” or of “extensiveness,” as in debellare, defatigare, delaborare, and so forth? Again the nature of image-schematic under- standing helps account for such apparent contradictions in meaning, as this sense likely arises when the trajector’s movement between landmarks is conceptually foregrounded, emphasizing the process of transition from one state to the other. Similarly, de ̄’s opposing senses of strengthening and pejoration probably arise when the landmarks are attributed differential values, perhaps also in accor- dance with the entrenchedmetaphorical understanding of what is good as “up” and what is bad as “down” (cf. rectus, lit. “upright,” in the sense of “honest, good”; </page> <page sequence="19"> 396 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 superior, supremus, and inferior as synonyms ofmelior, summus, and peior; sub-, lit. “under,” with the sense of “reduced intensity in the action or quality”: Lewis &amp; Short, s.v.). Its ability to signify causality (indicating the cause of some state of being, as in Enn. Ann. 237, cum lassus . . . fuisset de summis rebus regundis; Ov. Met. 10.49, incessit passu de vulnere tardo; or Am. 3.5.6, umida de guttis lene sonantis aquae) or referentiality (indicating the model according to which something should be done, as in Pl. Most. 773, de exemplo meo ipse aedificato) likely depends on a construal of the scenario in which lm2 actually corresponds to the trajector, so that this landmark, interpreted metaphorically as an event or circumstance, is understood as being effectively “produced” from the region of origin (lm1), which can be another event, a behavior 3, idea, object, etc 0. As a final example, consider the case of de ̄’s frequent sense of topicality— i.e., when it is used to indicate the subject in regard to which some written or spoken discourse unfolds—as in, e.g., Pl. Merc. 642, numquid est quod dicas aliud de illo? (“Isn’t there anything else you can tell me about him?”) or 899, non curo istunc, de illa quaero. de illa ergo ego dico tibi (“CHAR. I don’t care about him, it’s about her that I’m asking. Eut. Then I’ll tell you about her”), or as, very commonly, in the titles of literary works. It may well be the case that this meaning emerged from a figurative understanding in which “the talking about a person or thing was represented as the removal of the speech-substance from the topic under consideration,” as Leumann, Hofmann, and Szantyr (1972: II, 261–62) suggest. There is some evidence that such a metaphor operated in Latin’s semantic system: For instance, we find that the Latin wordmateria, literally referring to the material substance of which something is composed, can also be used metaphorically (like its English relative, matter) in the sense of the “topic” or “theme” or “idea” of some discourse. However, this metaphor (“ideas are substances”), though regular in English, appears to be highly circumscribed in Latin not only lexically (substantia, for example, while a clear synonym of materia in its literal sense, does not share its metaphorical meanings) but also temporally and contextually, occurring primarily in the works of Cicero and, later, in Quintilian, Seneca, and Pliny (probably under the orator’s influence). In this sense, the metaphor can be considered an “expert” image, since it does not find widespread distribution throughout Latin expression. More likely, therefore, de ̄’s topicality sense should be explained in the con- text of a highly conventionalized metaphorical pattern in Latin whereby men- tal phenomena of all kinds—thoughts, beliefs, plans—are conveyed in terms of movement in physical space. I have demonstrated the structure of this metaphori- cal pattern, in which, specifically, images of motion toward, motion from, and 30. Cf. Nikiforidou 1991 on “causes are origins,” and Luraghi 2005. The metaphor exists in many languages besides Latin, including English, and may well be universal: see Croft 1991. This sharing of metaphorical understanding is the reason why, as Leumann, Hofmann, and Szantyr 1965: 262 remark, it is “usually possible to see how such metaphorical meanings develop.” </page> <page sequence="20"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 397 position in a location systematically deliver the categories of expression in Latin that pertain to “acquiring,” “relinquishing,” and “having” ideas in mind (Short 2012a). Thus, Latin speakers talk about formulating plans, considering ideas, con- ceiving notions, and so on, as “entering,” “occupying,” “coming to,” “returning to,” “moving to,” and even “falling” or “slipping into” a location, whereas they speak of having a thought in mind, agreeing with an idea, or holding an opinion in terms of “being” or “standing in” a location, and of abandoning a belief, giving up on a design, or changing one’s mind as “standing away,” “leaving” and “departing from” a location. Indeed, inasmuch as it provides the most frequent, most sys- tematically coherent, and most potentially elaborated metaphorical image, this metaphor likely represents Latin speakers’ “preferential” or “privileged concep- tualization” (Ko ̈vecses 2005: 82–86) of mental phenomena, thus constituting a more likely source of figurative meaning development. If, under this metaphor, an idea is conceived metaphorically as a location, then whatever sort of mental activ- ity (discoursing, writing, thinking, etc.) is seen as emerging “out of” or “from” that location will be understood as essentially related or conforming to—because originating from—that idea. Given what I have suggested is the most feasible motivation for the devel- opment of de ̄’s sense of “about” or “concerning”—namely, the metaphor “ideas are locations,” which structures much of Latin speakers’ talk about mental activity—it is interesting to compare this usage with the situation in Greek, where the same meaning is expressed by περ  + gen. or acc. or  μφ  + dat. Both prepo- sitions have the literal spatial sense of “on both sides, on all sides,” and so in Greek as well as in Latin mental phenomena appear to be understood in terms of locations: as Silvia Luraghi (2003: 258) explains, “The extension of prepositions meaning ‘about,’ ‘around’ to verbs of mental activity or communication (‘speak,’ ‘write,’ etc.) which one can observe in Greek not only with amphı ́ but also with perı ́ . . . can also be found in English as well as several other Indo-European languages; it is based on a metaphor according to which the stimulus with such verbs is conceived as being in a spatial location, and what is thought or said about it is conceived as developing in the area that surrounds it.” There is a difference between the Greek and Latin metaphors, however. In Greek, mental activity seems to be viewed as a kind of container or structure that is built up “around” the thought-location: John Onians (1991, 1992) has shown that the Greek mental vocabulary is in fact largely organized around “pottery” and “build- ing” metaphors. In Latin, on the other hand, mental activity is understood—as we have seen—above all in terms of physical motion toward or away from, or position in, a thought-location. This implies that semantic development, even at the level of individual word senses, must be explained by reference to larger patterns of figurative meaning internal to the language under consideration, and not imposed from outside. De ̄’s usage in reference to topicality “makes sense” to Latin speakers because it fits within their particular way of conceiving the mind, </page> <page sequence="21"> 398 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 which is very different from Greek speakers’—let alone English speakers’—way of doing the same. IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, I have discussed a number of cases in which the semantic value of de ̄ appears to go (often forcefully) against conventional “textbook” definitions of this word, which stress separation and downward motion as distinctive features of its meaning. But if the senses of “away from” and “down” do not always factor into our interpretations of de ̄—sometimes their opposites, “toward” and “up,” in fact better characterize particular uses—thenwhat, ultimately, defines this word? I have argued for a re-definition of de ̄ along cognitive linguistic lines— and specifically in terms of an image-schematic scenario—that takes the meaning of this preposition to be schematized embodied experience, rather than strictly propositional knowledge. Re-defining de ̄ in this way provides a more workable, and more cognitively realistic, semantic model that is capable of accommodating the variety of concrete spatial meanings as well as abstract figurative meanings the preposition demonstrates in actual usage, resting on the susceptibility of image schemas, as embodied patterns of experience, to equally embodied mental “transformations” that produce distinct changes in linguistic meaning, and to metonymic and metaphorical interpretation. The value of this model is that it permits all de ̄’s senses to be explained by a limited number of systematic, brain- based mechanisms of meaning extension. It also, more generally, points the way to engaging the study of Latin semantics in a broader endeavor in the humanities and the social sciences that seeks to shed light on the very meaning of “meaning” and to demonstrate how image-based meaning construction varies from language to language and from culture to culture 31. To begin with, the image-schematic (re)definition of de ̄ I have proposed has certain implications for Latin lexicography. DavidWharton (2011) has pinpointed several shortcomings of the nineteenth-century historical semantics traditionally governing Latin dictionary writing: that it fails to incorporate frequency data; gives peripheral, context-dependent senses the same status as central and basic senses; relies on the semantics of English to determine sense divisions in Latin; and so forth. More problematically in my view, this semantics does not include a well- developed theory of figurativeness (cf. Geeraerts 2010: esp. 25–31; Blank 1999), so that Latin dictionaries tend not to provide clear information about the relations between senses, beyond invoking simplistic or ad hoc principles of “tropic” or “transferred” meaning change. Lewis &amp; Short’s entry for de ̄, for instance, represents its significations “in space” (I.A) and “in time” (I.B) as equally basic (literal?) senses; but as time is conceptualized according to specific metaphorical models of spatial motion, would I.B not be listed more correctly as an extended 31. See esp. Palmer 1996. </page> <page sequence="22"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 399 sense of I.A? Similarly, de ̄’s signifying ancestral descent or familial belonging is given as a “tropic” extension of its usage “to point out the place from which any thing is brought” (I.A.2); yet filiation and kinship relations were scarcely conceived in Roman culture as physical removal. (In fact, an adequate account of this sense seems to require the integration of “encyclopedic” information, e.g., about social practices.)32 Thus, while doing a good job of documenting the range of historically attested senses and of cataloguing subtle variations in meaning, these dictionaries leave something to be desired in representing how Latin speakers actually understood words. Image schema theory (and cognitive linguistics more generally), by posit- ing that “much of our knowledge . . . is grounded in and structured by various patterns of our perceptual interactions, bodily actions, and manipulations of ob- jects” (Gibbs and Colston 1995: 347) and by recognizing a limited number of cognitively motivated construal operations (cf. esp. Sweetser 1990; Brugman and Lakoff 1988; Lakoff 1987) that guide meaning change both diachronically and synchronically, instead implies a clear organizational structure for the lex- icon and provides a consistent set of general principles for explaining meaning extension. At the global level of lexical ordering, it suggests that entries might be arranged within clusters or frames according to all-pervasive metaphorical patterns (cf. Moon 2004). For example, the metaphor motivating de ̄’s usage in reference to topicality—namely, “ideas are locations”—is the same metaphor that determines the polysemy of locus between “a location” or “place” and “an idea” or “subject of thought or discourse,” along with the figurative meanings of a great part of Latin’s regular vocabulary of physical motion, and many idiomatic expressions (see again Short 2012a). The linear alphabetical arrangement of a traditional dictionary obscures this kind of large-scale metaphorical patterning in Latin’s semantic system, however, giving the mistaken impression that metaphor- ical senses belong to individual words, or represent novel usages—rather than reflections of conventionalized supra-lexical meaning structures. At the level of entry arrangement, meanwhile, it suggests the listing and division of senses should follow from the nature of image schemas as embodied conceptual structures—that is, as mental representations of physico-spatial expe- rience susceptible to specific kinds of construal operations, including metonymic and metaphoric interpretation, that extend meaning into more abstract domains. Thus, the entry for de ̄ might begin with a graphical representation of the image schema, alongside a brief description of this schema, followed by readings in the spatial domain grouped according to the various transformations that this image schema is capable of undergoing in terms of vantage-point shifts, pro- filing effects, and topographical configurations, with consequent modifications of sense. Metonymically derived extended spatial interpretations (e.g., material 32. On the division between “semantic” and “encyclopedic” knowledge in lexicography, see esp. Geeraerts 1999; Gruber 1985. </page> <page sequence="23"> 400 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 composition) might then be listed, with highly abstract metaphorically moti- vated interpretations appearing under rubrics that indicate the target domain in question (e.g., ideas or events) and provide cross-references illustrating the un- derlying metaphor. So de ̄’s usage in signifying pejoration might fall (along with negation and privation) under something like “As interpreted of states of being,” with references to expressions reflecting both the “states are loca- tions” metaphor (cf., e.g., in dubio sum, sto, maneo, iaceo, haereo: see Fedriani 2011: 314–16) and the “good is up,” “bad is down” orientational metaphors motivating this sense. But my claim that de ̄’s meaning is best defined in terms of an embodied image schema has ramifications beyond our understanding of a single word, and beyond even our conception of the lexicon. Because image schema theory provides a framework for explaining meaning and semantic change systemati- cally and in terms of established cognitive principles—especially metaphorical understanding—it also opens a window on the interconnectedness of Roman society’s conceptual system. Under this theory, otherwise seemingly unrelated concepts can be brought into connection. The metaphors that Brucale and Moc- ciaro (2011) have identified as underlying the abstract senses of Latin per, and that Fedriani (2011) has argued organize Latin’s eventive and stative expressions, for example, very largely coincide with those operating on the meaning of de ̄. Of course, image schemas and their transformations can also motivate the meanings of more complex, culturally situated categories (cf. Ziemke et al. 2008). I have shown that the polysemy of the Latin word sermo can be accounted for in terms of the link schema and systematically related spatial re-configurations of this schema, which are then interpreted against metaphorical frames—including the vertical model of time that partially motivates de ̄’s usage in reference to kinship relations (Short 2012b). In other words, such a theory sheds light on meaning structures that work their effects across, and at different levels of, Latin speakers’ symbolic system. More broadly, by highlighting a level of shared and (so to speak) “baked- in” meanings, the approach I take here complements methods of studying Latin literature now dominant in Classical Studies, where the tendency has been to emphasize the individual dimension of meaning making and to focus on the open- endedness of interpretation (see, e.g., Fowler 2000). Instead of viewing authors as minds floating disembodied and disconnected in space, as it were—and explaining commonalities of expression primarily in terms of some ongoing game of liter- ary one-upmanship (cf. esp. Hinds 1998)—the embodied meaning perspective takes imaginative expression to be built up from symbolic structures that are par- tially emergent and partially codified, partially situated and partially conventional, partially contextual and partially cultural—and in some cases also partially uni- versal. Because emergent meanings can be shown to regularly elaborate, extend, and combine culturally situated meanings (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 52–53), far from diminishing authorial creativity this perspective actually helps illustrate how </page> <page sequence="24"> short: Latin De ̄: A View From Cognitive Semantics 401 authors fashion new meaning in context 33. Furthermore, it implies constraints on the boundless proliferation of meaning, since in cognitive linguistics sense mak- ing depends on the specific character of human cognition. Image schemas may be non-finitary in the sense that they mirror sensory experience “in a continuous, analog fashion within our understanding” (Johnson 1987: 4), but there are finite ways in which image-schematic meaning can be extended. In particular, in the form of the “Invariance Hypothesis,” this approach imposes a limit on the kinds of metaphorical associations Latin speakers might meaningfully have made 34. Image schema analysis in fact provides a strong foundation for “anthropolog- ical” studies of Roman society, especially incorporating comparison with other ancient or evenmodern societies. Because image schemas and themetaphors oper- ating on them are taken to be conceptual rather than strictly semantic structures— that is, structures of meaning potentially motivating and organizing forms of symbolic representation other than only language—this method suggests that identifiable patterns of linguistic usage can be linked to configurations of cul- ture at large—a society’s institutions, beliefs, values, theories, practices, and so forth, including its material artifacts. The “cultural linguistics” (Palmer 1996) or “cultural semantics” (Ko ̈vecses 2006) this points toward would aim to describe how Latin speakers’ ways of speaking, ways of thinking, and ways of behaving across even seemingly disparate aspects of life come together to constitute a coherent and unified signifying order. Additionally, by opening up a comparative perspective that begins from differences in how language speakers conceptualize given aspects of experience (cf. Bettini 2009b)—see the analysis of de ̄’s topi- cality sense above, or my discussion of Latin, Greek, and English’s differing metaphorical models of mind (Short 2012a)—this method would help tease out conceptual themes that mark these signifying orders as discrete and distinctive worldviews deserving to be viewed and appreciated on their own terms.35 University of Texas at San Antonio william.short@utsa.edu 33. E.g., in Short 2012b, I have considered how Vergil plays on image-schematically defined meanings of Mercury as part of the overall thematics of the Aeneid. 34. The “Invariance Hypothesis” or “Principle,” along with the theory of target-domain over- rides, has been stated in both strong and weak forms by different scholars working within the cognitive linguistic framework; perhaps the clearest definition is that given by Lakoff 1993: 215: “Metaphorical mappings preserve the cognitive topology (that is, the image-schema structure) of the source domain, in a way consistent with the inherent structure of the target domain.” See also Turner 1990. Brugman 1990 offers a critical view. 35. On metaphorical themes, see esp. Goatly 2007; cf. also Shore 1996 and Ko ̈vecses 2002 on the role of cognitive models more generally in shaping cultural artifacts. Danesi and Perron 1999: 294 refer to such culturally pervasive cognitive structures as “macrosignifieds,” or “signifieds that underlie the specific forms that various signifying structures assume across the signifying-order; i.e., a macrosignified is a signified that links together signs, codes, and texts throughout the culture.” </page> <page sequence="25"> 402 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 2 /October 2013 BIBLIOGRAPHY Baldi, P. 1999.
