<plain_text><page sequence="1">Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain" Daniel HSIEH Purdue University Introduction Among Du Fu's (712-770) earliest extant works is the poem entitled "Gazing at the Mountain" ("Wang yue" A*).' Traditional editors and commentators have included "Wang yue" among a handful of surviving pieces that appear to date from the period beginning with Du Fu's failure in the jinshi examinations of 735 or 736 through the several years he spent in the east and northeast during his travels in Qi Sand Zhao if.2 Modem scholars have generally agreed with the traditional chronol- ogy, and some have even maintained that "Wang yue" is Du Fu's earliest surviving poem.3 There seems to be no concrete evidence to warrant such precision; perhaps scholars such as Xiao Difei WIgP have been inspired to such conclusions, at least in part, by the poem's mood and theme, which seem to exude self-encouragement and youthful bravado in the face of Du Fu's recent failure in the exams. Though it is not necessary to insist that "Wang yue" is Du Fu's earliest extant poem, the circumstan- tial biographical evidence, combined with the qualities of the poem itself, have led most critics and commentators to conclude that "Wang Yue" was composed as early as 736-737 or soon afterwards. Because "Wang yue" appears to be one of the earliest of Du Fu's extant works, it has been the focus of much critical attention. Its famous third couplet, in particular, has provoked much discussion and controversy. A number of recent studies have attempted to reinterpret the poem, often using the startling, puzzling third couplet and the implications of its various possible meanings as a crux of discussion.4 But no 'I would like to express my gratitude to Jonathan Pease for his warm encourgement and his careful reading and editing of the draft of this paper. I also thank the three CLEAR readers for their helpful com- ments and suggestions. 2In editions that attempt to arrange Du Fu's poems in chronological order, "Wang yue" is placed among the first several works. For example, it is the first piece in Pu Qilong's .fgi (b. 1679) Du Du xin jie FiLf_; the second piece in Qiu Zhaoao's k{lJLE (1638-1713 or after) Du shi xiangzhu if? g:- and Yang Lun's %jli (1747-1803) Du shi jingquan f?n . 3See, for example, Xiao Difei Aig~@, trans., Du Fu shi xuanzhu -flnMN (Beijing: Renmin wenxue chubanshe, 1979), p. 2. William Hung has suggested that one and possibly two poems may be dated prior to Du Fu's taking the jinshi exam. See William Hung, review of A.R.

This study will review various discussions of the poem, attempt to reconcile some seemingly contradictory explana- tions, and offer a new interpretation. I also will attempt to explain its significance within the Chinese poetic tradition. Du Fu was the bridge between High Tang and Mid-Tang poetry (one could even speak of pre- and post-Du Fu verse with only slight exaggeration). Even in a work as early as "Wang yue" we can see features of Du Fu's distinctive style that both broke with and yet adhered to "classical" traditions and standards. By scrutinizing a single work we may better understand at least certain aspects of Du Fu's transformation of the poetic tradition. Setting In 735 or 736 Du Fu took the jinshi examination.5 Prior to the exam he had spent several years in the regions of Wu lq and Yue X (the southeast) wandering through an area rich in legend and history. Du Fu himself was a northerner, from Jingzhao ,,, the capital prefecture.6 It is not clear what prompted his southern travels. They seem to have begun around 730-731 and probably lasted until around 735 when he returned north for the exams. He presumably first took and passed the prefectural exams, earning the privilege of becoming what was termed "local tribute" (xiang gong 51~), and thus qualifying to take the jinshi. His subsequent failure in the jinshi must have been a great shock and disappointment. Du Fu, who was now a young man expecting to assume the role and duties of a scholar-official, suddenly found himself without entry into the civil service. Du Fu mentions his failure in several later poems. In works such as "Zhuang you" ?jp ("The Wanderings of My Youth") and "Feng zeng Wei zuocheng zhang ershier yun" fi'-n" ,~-~$5t i ("Twenty-two Rhymes Respectfully Presented to Assistant Director of the Left Wei"), Du Fu portrays himself as an assured young man, confident of passing the exams, suddenly shocked by the reality of failure.7 One would be hard pressed to design a better jinshi candidate. His learning, his literary gifts, his concern for the people and the dynasty, all would seem to guarantee success. It is true, however, that only a very small percentage of jinshi candidates passed.8 In Du Fu's descriptions of his failure and disappointment there is a clear Zhongguo shehui kexue chubanshe, 1982), pp. 456-459; Zhang Xuanqu M~f~, "Man tan Du shi 'Wang yue' zhu jie" ~-f-i~f, in Wenxue pinglun congkan vol. 13, pp. 460-465; Wu Mingxian IEJR, "Du Fu 'Wang yue' zhi bijiao" tt-;?- LVb , Du Fu yanjiu no. 3 (1988): 32-37; Yang Yuxiang $jt1, "'Wang yue' lijiaodian shixi" ~I Y ,F ~ Du Fu yanjiu no. 2 (1989): 56-57; Zhong Shuliang ~i , "Du Du Fu zaonian shi zha ji" ~ilt4~~f .L, , Du Fu yanjiu no. 1 (1990): 1-9. SThe date and location of the exam is uncertain. Most scholars have thought that Du Fu took the exam in 735 in Loyang (which was then functioning as the principal capital). William Hung (Hong Ye At) has vigorously argued that Du Fu took the exams in Chang'an in 736; William Hung, Tu Fu: China's Greatest Poet, with a supplementary volume of notes (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952), pp. 25-28, notes, pp. 24-25. 6Du Fu thought of himself as a man of the capital region of Chang'an, but his family also had roots in Yanshi ERdif near the Eastern Capital, Loyang. 7 Guo Zhida B;ZL (Song), ed., Jiu jia jizhu Du shi fL it?-,~ , in Hong Ye ,A (William Hung), et al. eds., Du shi yin de t?tg.

(1940 [in the Harvard-Yenching Institute Sinological Index Series]; reprint, Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1985) [hereafter Jiu jia], 12.169-72 and 1.1-3, respectively. 8William Hung assumes that Du Fu was a candidate from the Jingzhao prefecture. He notes that this in itself was a very great honor, and that such candidates usually passed the exams. Hung even maintains</page><page sequence="3">HSIEH Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain" 3 sense that his misfortune was undeserved, yet he does not try to explain or blame.9 It has been suggested that Du Fu's style did not fit with the current fashion, but this is speculative, and in the end we simply do not know why this seemingly ideal candi- date was not passed.10 Du Fu's experience with the jinshi exam may help us to understand "Wang yue." It is important that we have some idea of his frame of mind as he left the capital and headed east. The civil service exams were crucial to men of Du Fu's class; they could make or break a career. The joy, exhilaration and relief of success, but more often the shock and despair of failure frequently found expression in literati poetry. Failure could mark a man's personality for the rest of his life. The lives and verse of the mid-Tang poets Meng Jiao -iJ3 (751-814) and Li He -f- (790-816), for example, were crucially shaped by the frustrations and perceived injustices they experienced while struggling with the exams. Meng Jiao's bitterness and anger-the twisted, painful vision of the world portrayed in his verse-can at least in part be traced to his disappointment and shock at failing the exams twice (he finally passed in 796)." The exams were often a young man's first encounter with the realities of life. Previous to the exams he was innocent. The candidate studied the classics, composed poetry, and dreamed. But the exams showed him that the world did not necessarily work as it should. Passing the exams was a complex process with many factors: one's back- ground, connections, and politics could be as important as one's ability. It was not always fair. If one failed, there followed a critical period in one's life when one had to struggle to recover and adjust. In a number of post-exam pieces one finds writers expressing their disappointment and attempting to overcome their sense of failure.12 Gazing at the mountain Soon after failing the jinshi, Du Fu left the capital (whether Chang'an or Loyang we are not sure), beginning new wanderings that would last eight years. He headed east, the immediate goal of his journey probably being to visit his father who was assistant prefect (sima Q,) in Yanzhou :0J'I4 (present day Yanzhou 'Jl4'I xian, that Du Fu was the lone Jingzhao candidate to fail the jinshi of 736 (but this assertion appears to be based upon very slight, questionable evidence); Tu Fu: China's Greatest Poet, pp. 25-28. As has been noted, how- ever, the date and location of Du Fu's jinshi exam is still unsettled. Moreover, Du Fu may have been a candidate from Yanshi rather than Jingzhao. 'Du Fu uses the phrase wu xia f{-T to describe his failing the exam; see "Zhuang you," Jiu jia, 12.170. The sense of wu is difficult to fix. A.R Davis translates it as "perversely;" A.R. Davis, Tu Fu (New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1971), p. 20. William Hung suggests "thwarted"; William Hung, review of A.R.

Stephen Owen discusses the influence of the exams on Meng Jiao's verse, see The Poetry of Meng Chiao and Han Yu (New Haven and London, Yale University Press, 1975), pp. 55-72. 12 A clear, frank example of such a work is Han Yu's J., (768-824) "Rhapsody on Encountering Two Birds" ( "Gan er niao fu"  -,i ). This piece was composed after Han Yu had failed the placement exam (boxue hongci ~~ ) for the third time, and finally left Chang'an in defeat. See Han Yu, Han Changli wenji jiaozhu E - , ed. Ma Tongbo ,ffi (Shanghai: Gudian wenxue chubanshe, 1957), 1.2-3.</page><page sequence="4">4 Chinese Literature, Essays, Articles, Reviews 16 (1994) Shandong). Du Fu mentions his visit in his poem "Climbing the City-Wall Tower at Yanzhou" ("Deng Yanzhou chenglou" c# J(\'It[id)."3 Because Mount Tai was located within Yanzhou prefecture it has been reasonably assumed that Du Fu visited Mount Tai around this time, and thus "Wang yue" is usually assigned to the year 736 or 737. Though the evidence is admittedly tenuous, the traditional dating does appear to be a strong possibility. If "Wang Yue" was not composed around the time of his visit to his father, it was most likely composed soon afterwards, during the few years Du Fu spent traveling through the Qi and Zhao region, and thus is one of the few extant works from this period in his life: Mount Tai-What is it like? ,,, iJ Through Qi and Lu its azure never ends;  i-T Here the Creator gathers wonders divine, "i- Its northern and southern slopes divide dusk and dawn. jIJ B Heaving breast-growing layered clouds, J Split eye-sockets-enter returning birds; One day I (too) will mount the highest peak, ]], Where in one glance all other mountains dwindle.14 Though it is an early work, one immediately recognizes the touch of the man who would eventually become one of China's two most celebrated poets. This poem has long been admired for the strength and boldness of its voice. A number of critics, aware of the biographical setting-that the poem was composed soon after Du Fu's failure in the exams and subsequent retreat from the capital-have been especially moved by his spirit and youthful confidence. Instead of succumbing to failure, we find Du Fu gazing at a mountain and promising himself that he would someday (like Confucius) mount its peak and gaze down upon the world. The daring imagery, in particular the strange third couplet, is striking; it is an early example of a unique approach to language and diction that would eventually help transform poetry. But though "Wang yue" has long been appreciated and discussed, it is a far more complex work than has usually been thought. It is not only an expression of confi- dence and resolve; it also represents the balancing of a welter of seemingly "contra- dictory" thoughts and feelings, whose key lies in the third couplet. This couplet, with its striking, violent images and puzzling ambiguities, has been the subject of much admiration, controversy and discussion. Various interpretations of the couplet have led to varying explanations of the poem. No single interpretation has proven com- pletely satisfactory. Moreover, the question of the reasons for the couplet's difficulty and ambiguity has not yet been addressed. The rest of the poem appears to read relatively smoothly and straightforwardly. Why did Du Fu compose this couplet in the manner that he did? It needs to be recognized that these images and ambiguities are not simply the result of a desire to dazzle or impress. Du Fu composed these lines with a deliberate purpose; only after we have fitted the character of his language to his feelings and thoughts can we say that we understand his poem. The deliberate ambiguities of his lines are an attempt to reflect the complexity of his feelings and 3 Jiu jia, 17.273 14Jiu jia, 1.5-6.</page><page sequence="5">HSIEH Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain" 5 ideas. They should be seen as a signal, an invitation to the reader to reflect and reconsider. Read in the most natural, grammatically straightforward manner (assuming a s-v-o construction), the third couplet hardly seems to make sense: dang i xiong fl sheng t ceng e yun - Heaving/scoured - breast - gives birth to - layered - clouds jue '? zi ru n, gui ~ niao , split - eye-sockets - enter - returning - birds Du Fu is gazing at Mount Tai. What can it mean to say that his breast gives birth to clouds or that his eye-sockets split and enter returning birds? Clearly these are lines to wrestle with. Commentators have suggested a number of solutions which require adjustments of greater or lesser degrees of severity. The simplest, most common explanation assumes that this is an example of poetic inversion; a possible interpreta- tion of the first line being that it is Mount Tai that gives birth to layered clouds, the sight of which causes Du Fu's breast to heave in exhilaration."5 Dang M, however, has several other meanings in addition to "shake" or "heave," including "rush," "scour," or "cleanse." Commentators have noted that the phrase dang xiong Mh has a prece- dent in Zhang Heng's Nk{_ (78-139) "Nan du fu" MJ- ("Southern Capital Rhap- sody"), "The Yu River scours its breast" (Yushui dang qi xiong 7JC-h;,).16 Another interpretation thus suggests that the growing layered clouds and mists are sweeping past Du Fu's breast.17 This seems to better capture the vividness and power of the line (and possibly the sense), but it gives rise to the problem of exactly where Du Fu is in relation to Mount Tai. The title of the poem suggests that Du Fu is gazing at Mount Tai from a distance. But if this is the case, how could he describe the clouds and mists as rushing by his breast? Some commentators have thus suggested that Du Fu is somehow "imagining" his ascent, or as one commentator has put it: He imagines the ascent of the mountain in this way. It is not a realistic description. It cannot be explained by simply looking at the sentences and words. Du Fu's person is at the foot of the mountain, but his spirit is wandering at its peak.18 In a somewhat similar explanation, Qiu Zhaoao {)Ljlk (1638-after 1713) has de- scribed the poem as a progression of views: This was composed while gazing at the Eastern Mountain (Mt. Tai). The poem was written with four stages in mind. The first couplet is the mountain's appearance as observed while gazing from the distance. The next couplet is its stance (shi 3) when closely viewed. The third couplet is the scene minutely observed. The last couplet is s See, for example, Qiu Zhaoao's comment in his Du shi xiangzhu 5 vols. (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1979), 1.4; Xiao Difei, ed., Du Fu shi xuanzhu, p. 3, n. 5; David Hawkes, trans., A Little Primer of Tu Fu (1967; reprint, Hong Kong: Renditions Paperbacks, 1990), p. 4. 16 Xiao Tong ,?A (501-531), comp., Li zhu Zhaoming wen xuan EtEt2., ed.

The first six lines are a realistic narration; the last two lines are an imaginary depiction."1 A number of recent critics, however, are uncomfortable with the idea of imaginary ascents of the spirit and shifting viewpoints, and have attempted to overturn these traditional interpretations. They have gone so far as to suggest that Du Fu is not gazing at a mountain, but rather from a mountain, some saying that Du Fu has climbed one of the lower peaks and is gazing at the highest peak; others maintain that he has actually mounted the highest peak and is gazing downward. Only in this way do they feel they can account for the image of Du Fu apparently level with the swirling clouds and mists of the mountain heights.20 These recent interpretations are not very convincing. To begin with, they violate the natural reading of the title. Wang yue cannot mean "gazing from the Mountain." Such interpretations do show, how- ever, the problems that this line raises. Another recent and even more radical proposal suggests that the subject of the third couplet is not Du Fu, but Mount Tai itself: it is Mount Tai that is heaving its breast and giving birth to clouds and mist. The split eye-sockets are explained as caverns or grottoes into which returning birds enter. Paul Kroll argues that since each previous couplet focuses on the mountain itself, it is unnecessary to shift the focus toward the speaker. By taking Mount Tai as the subject one avoids the "...'daring' inversion of normal syntax and the logical incongruities necessitated by the approved interpretation."21 But one cannot help feel that this is going too far. This degree of anthropomorphism seems too extreme, even bizarre. With regard to the structure of the work, the third couplet of an eight line poem is the typical location of the break or turn, and thus a natural place for a change of subject or focus.22 More important, the rationale or intent of such a striking conception is not clear. One is left with a strange, gaping image (how and why do caves and grottoes become likened to split eye- sockets?) with little hint as to how it is to be "pursued." Accordingly, even Kroll backs away somewhat from his reading, acknowledging that both interpretations (his and the traditional) are possible. He suggests that Du Fu may have been deliberately ambiguous, and notes that Franqois Cheng has also explored this possibility: "1Qiu Zhaoao, ed., Du shi xiang zhu, 1.4. 20See Xu Yongzhang (1980), Xiong Zhiqi (1982), Zhang Xuanqu (1982), Yang Yuxiang (1989). 21Kroll, "Verses from on High...," p. 182. 22Stephen Owen notes that Du Fu often followed this pattern in his regulated verse; Traditional Chinese Poetry and Poetics, p. 74. It is true that "Wang yue" is not a regulated poem in terms of tonal prosody, but its structure is that of a regulated poem. Traditional critics have pointed out that the third couplet of a regulated poem, like the third line of a jueju, was the natural place for the "turn" (zhuan $~). It is interest- ing to compare the structure of "Wang yue" to an eight-line regulated poem by Wang Wan Ti (jinshi 712-13) entitled "Ci Beigu shan xia" ?M4L LLIT ("Stopping at Beigu Mountain"; Quan Tang shi, 115.1170). It also has a very striking third couplet, "The ocean sun is born in the remaining night,/ The river spring- time enters the old year." Stephen Owen says of the second half of this couplet, "...this line truly defies comprehension, startles the reader, and forces him to consider the couplet deeply." Stephen Owen, High T'ang, p. 15. Wang Wan's and Du Fu's poems are not related thematically, but they are similar in their use of the third couplet. Strangely enough, both couplets use sheng t and ru k in the forceful third position of the fifth and sixth lines respectively. It is possible that Du Fu was inspired by Wang Wan's couplet. Du Fu surely would have known Wang Wan's piece which was widely celebrated during his day. The third couplet in particular was especially admired. Zhang Yue Ra- (667-730) is said to have cited it as an exam- ple of a model couplet and had it inscribed upon the Administration Chamber (zhengshi tang *i1 2$); see Yin Fan B~AW, comp., He yue yingling ji ' Mffl IT4 (completed 753), juan B, in the Tangren xuan Tangshi S, -# (1958; reprint, Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1978), p. 106.</page><page sequence="7">HSIEH Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain" 7 In the absence of the personal pronoun it is possible to ask whether the "straining chest" and the "bursting eyes" are those of the poet, or of the mountain personified. In reality the poet is trying to express precisely the identification of the climber with the mountain, and to give a vision of the mountain within.23 Franqois Cheng's explanation is interesting. It is a daring attempt to both acknowl- edge and account for the ambiguities of Du Fu's imagery. However, while one should not immediately reject this interpretation, it still does not appear to fully explain the emotions and ideas that Du Fu may have been trying to express, and it is necessary to explore other possibilities.24 The second half of the couplet is just as striking and puzzling. The phrase jue zi j- (burst or split eye-socket) is extremely violent, as is the ensuing image, which a literal reading could take as birds entering into split eye-sockets or even split eye- sockets entering into returning birds. The usual explanation is that Du Fu is gazing so intently at the birds as they return to the mountain and enter his view that he strains his eyes until his eye-sockets seem to burst. While I would agree that the traditional explanation may serve as a basic interpretation, that is to say, this is one of the events that is actually taking place and being described, it does not go far enough in consid- ering the striking violence of the imagery and its possible significance. Why does Du Fu use such disturbing imagery and convoluted diction to convey a seemingly straightforward event? What is the intent of the image of split eye-sockets? Com- mentators have pointed out several precedents for this phrase. Cao Zhi's J -_4, (192-232) "Meng dong pian" jtpS-i ("Early Winter") contains the line, "They widen their eyes splitting their sockets," (zhang mu jue zi Nk [Ij) ).25 The phrase describes the fierce gaze of a hunter. Although this line helps us understand Du Fu's line-in each case we see a splitting of the socket caused by stretching or widening one's eyes-it is not being used in exactly the same sense. The other precedent often cited has nothing to do with gazing at all. In Sima Xiangru's I,,,UPH[ (179-117 B.C) "Zixu fu" '-TFJI ("Sir Vacuous"), in a section describing a hunt, there is the following passage: Their bows are not fired in vain; Hitting the mark they are certain to split an eye, Impale a breast, pierce a foreleg, p]80s Or snap the heart's cords.26 23 Franqois Cheng, Chinese Poetic Writing, trans. Donald A. Riggs and Jerome P. Seaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1982), p. 147. 24The Qing critic, Wu Jingxu ,itL, quotes several works which show that the interpretations of Cheng and Kroll were anticipated by certain traditional scholars: The Cao commentary to the Guangyun (Guangyun Cao zhu PClli~ ; I have not been able to identify) says, "'dang xiong' refers to the breast of the mountain itself. It is used to describe the enriching breath (run qi V,) of the clouds, which cleanse and scour (dang di Zi1) the man's breast." The Sansthan Laoren yulu . ,4 (by Hu Shunzhi M.Rpf [1083-1143]) says, "In Zhang Pingzi's XzfiT (Zhang Heng [78-139]) 'Nandu fu' there is the line, 'The clear waters scour the breast.' In Xiangru's (Sima Xiang-ru [179-117 B.C.]) 'Zixu fu' there is the line, 'The bows are not fired in vain,/Hitting their mark they are certain to split the eye-socket.' Du Fu borrowed the words from these twofu. 'Dang' and 'xiong' are spoken of with respect to the mountain. Some say they refer to the person. This is incorrect."

Original text in Wen xuan, juan 7.156.</page><page sequence="8">8 Chinese Literature, Essays, Articles, Reviews 16 (1994) Although several commentators have cited Sima Xiangru's line, they have not at- tempted to apply the image to Du Fu's line. Instead they have cited this as an exam- ple of Du Fu borrowing a phrase and then using it for his own different purposes.27 It may not be wise to ignore this possible signal; the precedent is possibly much more significant than has been thought. Stephen Owen, for example, while basically agree- ing with the traditional explanations, suspects that Du Fu is also drawing upon the imagery from the "Zixu fu" to suggest that his close attention to the returning birds is comparable to the archers taking aim when they hunt.28 However, we might take the hunting image even further, as will be discussed below. Another important question which has not been asked is why Du Fu's gaze should have focused on returning birds of all objects, and why they should impress him so much that they seem to enter his eyes (or his eyes even seem to enter the birds)? Up to this point the poem's subject matter has been fairly traditional. For example, clouds and mists are typically associated with mountains, and are often mentioned in the long tradition of Mount Tai poems. The image of returning birds is somewhat unexpected, though as will be seen it does have important precedents. The third couplet thus presents a host of problems. Du Fu's difficult, ambiguous language has caused commentators to differ on the literal meaning of his lines; more important, the rationale of his style and the significance of his images have yet to be fully explored. It is all very confusing. Before offering yet another explanation of these lines, I remind the reader that Du Fu's poem begins with him gazing at Mount Tai and then asking what in fact Mount Tai was like. As Paul Kroll has stressed, Du Fu's work belongs to a long tradition of Mount Tai poems, and Kroll's study, "Verses from on High: The Ascent of T'ai Shan" is an excellent review of this tradition. In addition, it is a helpful introduction to the place of mountains and specifically Mount Tai in the Chinese tradition.29 I will not go into detail on this important subject, but will simply review some points that we should keep in mind as we read Du Fu's poem. To begin with, mountains were sacred places. They were regarded as links between Heaven and Earth, and interme- diaries between Heaven and Man. Their peaks and clouds were seen as the source of rivers, rain, and fertility, hence generators of life; they were the abode of divinities, spirits, souls and immortals. Loved, respected and feared, they were repositories of a variety of spiritual feelings and thoughts, and meant different things to different people. They were the objects of state cults--emperors sacrificed at mountains; re- cluses retreated from the world into mountains; Daoists sought immortality in moun- tains. Each mountain had its character and significance. Mount Tai, object of Du Fu's gaze, most venerated of the Five Sacred Mountains (Wu yue HI ), was especially rich in traditions and lore. It was the site of thefeng 11 and shan 1i, the great imperial sacrifices to Heaven and Earth conducted by the emperor; it was the mountain that Confucius was supposed to have climbed; it was also known as an arbiter of fate, the controller of death and life, and it was to Mount Tai that the soul returned after death."3 In the body of Mount Tai verse one finds works reflecting these various 27 See the comments in Jiu jia, 1.6. 28 Owen, High T'ang, p. 380, n. 6. 29For a recent survey, see Kiyohiko Munakata, Sacred Mountains in Chinese Art (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1991). 30See Fan Ye rIfg, comp., Hou-Han shu /r " (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1965), 90.2980: "...The souls of the dead return to Daishan f[LJ (Mount Tai)."

See, for example, the story, "Jiang Ji" Mf from the Lie yi zhuan WIJ~f~ (traditionally attributed</page><page sequence="9">HSIEH Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain" 9 traditions ranging from celebratory verse, composed by officials accompanying their emperor's ascent, to yuefu laments and mourning songs. Cao Zhi, in his "Qu ju pian" ,E" , touches upon a number of these traditions, including the belief that Mount Tai was a spiritual site conducive to the pursuit of longevity and the immortality of a xian f1L.31 A mountain, then, was host to a variety of associations and traditions; it could mean many things. In the case of Mount Tai, a long, diverse literary tradition had developed around it.32 It was perhaps this rich tradition and multiplicity of meanings that drew Du Fu to the image of a mountain and led him to ask about its true nature. The "meanings" of Mount Tai would help him to explore, and finally resolve the complexities and contradictions that he saw in himself. When the reader comes to the sixth line of "Gazing at the Mountain" ("Split eye-sockets--enter returning birds"), he is at first puzzled and startled. The image is painful, violent, and the sense at first unclear. When the commentators cite Sima Xiangru's earlier use of the phrase jue zi, the impression becomes even more severe. The impact is eased, though, by the apparent explanation of the line. Du Fu simply seems to be describing his intense, strained gazing at the returning birds, albeit in a novel and forceful way. The traditional interpretation is correct. But it explains only one level of Du Fu's meaning. His choice of words and their effects is deliberate, and we should not ignore our first impressions. The painful, violent image and the asso- ciations with hunting and archery are Du Fu's way of alluding to his own sense of injury and distress. We know the impact that failure in the exams could have upon a man. It was an event that often found expression in poetry, and it is in the light of Du Fu's recent failure that we should read this poem. When Du Fu obliquely introduces the image of hunting and archery in this line, he is touching upon a metaphor that was often used by failed candidates. Examination lore was rich in imagery of success and failure. Taking the exams was often likened to doing battle. If you were success- ful you could be described as a dragon or an immortal: To succeed in becoming an official is like ascending among the immortals. To fail to become an official is like sinking into the Nether Springs (quan ,). The joy and the delight of the one, and the grief and bitterness of the other, are like the distance between Heaven and Earth.33 If you failed, you saw yourself as a bird shot down in mid-flight.34 Chen Zi'ang F-f~P' (659-700) opens his "Returning West After Failing: Parting From Wei Lin" ("Luo di xi huan bie Wei si Lin" "~fi~ ; j;~ji ) with the following couplet: A rolling tumbleweed-still not at rest, *4_T;t to Cao Pi f [187-226]); Li Fang JHJ, et al., eds., Taiping guangji ZVF1J (1959; reprint, Taibei: Wen shi zhe chuban she, 1987), 276.2177.

His ideals have been crushed, and his vision of the world literally shattered. Having to confront for the first time the realities of the world, Du Fu's feelings are complex. One of his thoughts is to retreat, to abandon the struggle. That is why Du Fu focuses so intently on the image of the returning birds. As was mentioned above, introducing such an image was not typical of Mount Tai poems.

The image and mood are peaceful and picturesque. These lines are among the most well known and loved in the tradition. But as James Hightower has explained, the poem is more complex than is ordinarily thought.38 Again, the clue lies in the image of the mountain. On the one hand, with the mention of the chrysanthemums and the linking of his southern hills (Lushan?) to the Southern Mountain of Shi jing no. 166 (ru nan shan zhi shou "rlj{ill2 "Like the longevity of the Southern Mountain"), Tao Yuanming is expressing a wish for long life. On the other hand, he is also expressing a longing to "return." The theme of returning was of course the central theme of Tao 3s Chen Zi'ang, Chen Zi'ang shi zhu *-J3--if4?I, ed.

In this instance, however, it is not simply a matter of reclusion, of giving up a career in the busy world for a quiet life, but of someday giving up life altogether and returning to his "true home," the southern mountains, the prospective site of his grave: My house is a traveller's inn, Al-iq_ And I am a guest about to depart; 4rag'g4 On and on, where shall I go? {,y To the southern hills, my old home.3" As Hightower has noted, the commentators agree that jiu zhai t?_ ("old home") refers to Tao Yuanming's grave. For Tao Yuanming, passing away was seen as a kind of return; at a certain point life and death are the same. In "Wang yue" Du Fu also uses the dual symbolism of the mountain to capture his feelings about living and dying, though his focus and intensity differ from Tao Yuanming. Tao Yuanming's voice is of that of a mature man accepting, even welcom- ing his ultimate fate. Du Fu is a young man shaken by failure, who yearns for escape and relief. Du Fu uses the image of the returning bird, a favorite symbol of Tao Yuan- ming's, not only to convey his longing to retreat and return, but also the sense that he had been "shot."40 Remember that Mount Tai was the mountain to which souls re- turned after death. This aspect of the mountain was often referred to in Mount Tai poems, some of which were mourning songs. For example, the Yuefu shiji preface to the yuefu title, "Mount Tai Song" ("Taishan yin" '~jJ4) notes: The "Taishan yin" speak of men dying and their spiritual souls (jing po a 4ER) return- ing to Mount Tai. It is in the same category of song as "Dew on the Shallots" ("Xie lu" tig) and "Haoli" AlT ("Artemisia Village"?).41 In his poem Du Fu has portrayed himself as a slain bird that has had its eye split, and I think one image of this line is that of a returning soul.42 One reading of this line then is, "Its eye split, the returning bird enters Mount Tai." To speak of returning to Mount Tai was actually a proverbial way of referring to death. It occurs a number of times in earlier verse: The joys of life not yet exhausted, XAMVf Suddenly one must return to the Eastern Mountain.43 I constantly worry I will soon be roaming Mount Tai, And never again see my friend.44 fRAVA, 39""Za shi" XRP no. 7; LQL, p. 1007. 4"Cf. "Gui qu lai ci" r f 0$ ("Return!"; LQL, p. 987): "When birds are weary of flight they know to return." Tao Yuanming also composed a series of poems entitled "Returning Birds" ("Gui niao" rig); LQL, p. 974. 41 Guo Maoqian -IYf-" is quoting the Yuefu jie ti Jf-N ; Guo Maoqian, comp., Yuefu shiji Jl$4Tf- (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1979), 41.605. "Dew on the Shallots" and "Artemisia Village" were both well known mourning songs. 42Birds would go on to become a favorite symbol and image of Du Fu's, e.g. "Lii ye shu huai," fiTz-; ("Thoughts While Traveling at Night;" Jiu jia, 27.415): "Floating, drifting, what am I like?/I am a single gull between Heaven and Earth." 43,"Yuan shi xing" ?i ff ("Song of Grief"); LQL, p. 275.</page><page sequence="12">12 Chinese Literature, Essays, Articles, Reviews 16 (1994) Once we understand the emotions and traditions that lay behind Du Fu's line we can approach the rest of the poem with fresh eyes. I have spoken of the multiplicity of traditions and beliefs associated with Mount Tai. While it was seen as the home of departed souls, it was also known as a source of life. Mountains in general, with their clouds, mists, and rivers were seen as sources of fertility. As Kroll has pointed out, Mount Tai, greatest of the sacred mountains, was particularly rich in this quality: Mount T'ai was naturally assumed to possess this life-giving quality in greater abun- dance than other heights, since it was the Marchmount of the East, the east being regarded as the cardinal direction of incipience for all creatures. One therefore sees why the souls of the newly departed dead were believed to make their way to T'ai Shan: they are returning back to their original place of animation.45 In the first line of the third couplet ("Heaving breast-growing layered clouds"), Du Fu draws upon this tradition of Mount Tai as generator of life. One traditional interpretation explains that Du Fu's breast heaves in excitement and exhilaration as he gazes upward at the clouds and mists. I would basically agree with this interpreta- tion; I do not think it is necessary to propose that Du Fu has already climbed or partially climbed the mountain. However, Wang Sishi's explanation that Du Fu had ascended in spirit to the heights of Mount Tai is insightful and suggestive. While he gazes at Mount Tai, Du Fu also pictures himself up among the mists and clouds. The image is, I think, of animation and birth. The word sheng t4, "to grow, give birth, to live" is crucial. It captures the dominant tone of this line, and contrasts with the violent and negative tone of the following line. Du Fu is exhilarated by the sight of the clouds and mists of Mount Tai; he imagines himself brushed by these same life generating clouds and mists; and finally the breaths emitted by his own heaving breast are seen as one and the same as the qi A, or life's breath of the mountain. I also wonder, however, if the image of the heaving breast may have another side. We have seen that in the following line, Du Fu saw himself as a fallen bird. The image he used was unusually striking and violent, and may "reflect" back on and add another facet to the image of the heaving breast. I wonder if Du Fu was imagin- ing his own stricken person. Perhaps his breath is a last, gasping breath, or his heav- ing breast a weeping, sobbing breast; his eyes split not only by arrows but by tears. As we and the Chinese say, "my tears fall like rain"; the Chinese could also say, "my gasps/sighs turn to clouds."46 It is typical of the young, especially children, to picture 44 Liu Zhen VIJ. (?-217), "Zeng Wu Guan zhonglang jiang si shou"  ~ ' e4  ("Four Poems for Leader of Court Gentlemen Wu Guan" no. 2); LQL, p. 370. 45Kroll, "Verses from on High...," p. 175. The Bowu zhi, quoting the Xiaojing yuanshen qi 4*ffITj$K1, notes, "Mount Tai is the grandson of the Lord of Heaven. It is in charge of summoning men's souls. The east is where the myriad creatures are first created, therefore it controls the length of a man's life." See Zhang Hua MSJ (232-300), Bowu zhi jiaozheng f-),-,, ed. Fan Ning -ii (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1980), 1.12. 46The image of one's sighing breath turning to clouds occurs in several earlier poems, cf. the conclud- ing couplet from Fu Xuan's fi42 (217-78) "Fang ge xing" f-l~~ff ("Letting Go"; LQL, p. 557), "A long moan, my tears fall like rain,/Deeply gasping (tai xi tf) my breath turns to clouds."

Admittedly this reading would seem unusually frank and extreme given the usual parameters of the poetic tradition, yet there is some precedent for it. Looking back at the literary tradition of mourning songs ("Wan ge" f.!R) and eulogies, we find a minor tradition of poets composing funeral pieces for or about themselves." Again, it was Tao Yuanming who returned to this theme several times: Last night I was a man among the living, RWIE~riAX This morning I am entered in the register of ghosts. 1 a- My soul-breath scatters, who knows where?

The first half of the couplet speak of the forces of life: exuberant gazing, life-giving mists. Yet even this positive picture has its negative side; the same images of life can also be seen as images of injury and sorrow. Du Fu's heaving breast may be sobbing, with his gasps turning to clouds. What is the proper reading? All are correct, all are expressive of Du Fu's thoughts and emotions at a single moment. Du Fu portrays himself as having been shot; as weary of the world and wanting to re- treat and return; he sees himself as wronged; perhaps he imagines his own death. Yet the sight of Mount Tai and the awareness of his mortality combine to trigger an equal and opposite effect: a new confidence, exhilaration, and resolve. With this couplet Du Fu has portrayed his encounter with his mortality and his reanimation or rebirth. This after all is "what Mount Tai is like." This multiplicity of meanings, and the inner unity of what sometimes may seem to be contradictory thoughts and emotions, run throughout "Wang yue." Du Fu describes Mount Tai as dividing yin P[ and yang W,. Commentators ordinarily read 47 After Tom Sawyer has been wrongly scolded by his aunt he takes solace by imagining his death: He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him, beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his poor hands still for ever, and his sore heart at rest.

Yet we now also understand that Du Fu was at the same time think- ing of yin and yang metaphorically. Mount Tai, as the destination of departed souls and also the animator or bestower of life, was the ultimate symbol of both life and death; of yin and yang together. Finally, Du Fu declares that someday he will mount the summit, where in a single glance all other mountains will dwindle. Du Fu is alluding to Confucius who was said to have climbed Mount Tai, the world dwindling before his eyes.52 By alluding to yet another Mount Tai tradition, Du Fu expresses the renewal of his hopes and ambitions. This was the sacred mountain most associated with statecraft. Emper- ors hoped to conduct feng and shan sacrifices there; officials hoped to climb it with their emperors;53 Confucius himself had been to the top.5 By declaring that he would emulate Confucius, Du Fu is indicating that his confidence and ideals have been "reborn." As was mentioned above, critics have particularly admired the strength and bravado of Du Fu's lines, especially in light of the fact that he had just failed the exams. We know of Du Fu's disappointment and pain, yet even while he was ex- pressing a sense of injury and a longing to retreat, this same person could declare that he would someday mount the summit as Confucius had. Once more, however, there is more to Du Fu's statement than meets the eye. This is more than bravado. Of course Du Fu will someday mount the summit. All men will mount the summit; all men will return to Mount Tai as departed souls. Du Fu's statement of bravado is also an acknowledgement of mortality. And it can be suggested that it was precisely this awareness of mortality that gave Du Fu comfort and strength. The word "gaze" (wang T) in the title of Du Fu's poem can also mean "expect," "wish," or "hope." Surely he had this other sense of wang in mind, as well as its basic meaning. He literally expected and hoped for the mountain and all the things that this meant. The inspiration for Du Fu's title was probably Tao Yuanming, who, as we have seen, also gazed at and longed for a mountain. It is true that most editions of Tao's collected works have jian QL ("to perceive, to catch sight of") rather than wang, and that critics from Su Shi ,,, (1037-1101) to James Hightower and Lin Wenyue have insisted that jian is the obviously superior reading.55 I personally prefer wang, in part because it has the secondary meaning of "expect" and "hope," and clearly Tao 51See the comments in Qiu Zhaoao, ed., Du shi xiang zhu, 1.4. 52Mengzi yizhu ?----, ed.

For Hightower's re- marks, see The Poetry of T'ao Ch'ien, p. 132.</page><page sequence="15">HSIEH Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain" 15 Yuanming, as Hightower has explained, was expecting or hoping as he gazed at his southern hills. I am not convinced by the usual poetic arguments that consider jian as more haphazard or uncalculated and thus more dramatic or natural. When one lives by a great mountain or by the sea, it is natural to regularly, even habitually, turn one's gaze in its direction, and Tao Yuanming must have often cast his gaze toward his Southern Mountain. Leaving aside, however, the question of the superiority of jian versus wang, it can be reasonably assumed that Du Fu was most familiar with the version of Tao Yuanming's poem that used wang. This is the variant found in the Wen xuan (juan 30; under the title "Za shi" Vol,), the anthology that was a cornerstone of the education of men in Du Fu's class. Du Fu of course may have had access to other versions of this poem found in collections of Tao Yuanming's verse, but he certainly knew the Wen xuan version well, and very likely had committed it to memory.57 Thus we can suggest that as Du Fu gazed at Mount Tai, he not only remembered Confu- cius, he also thought of Tao Yuanming, who had gazed at and had taken comfort in the sight of his Mountain. Du Fu began his poem by asking what Mount Tai was like. It was in fact many things. It was yin and yang; it was retreat and advance, life and death; it was the mountain of Confucius, and in a sense it was also the mountain of Tao Yuanming. It was precisely this multiplicity of meanings and traditions that awed and fascinated Du Fu. When he asked what Mount Tai was like, it helped him to answer the ques- tion of what he was like. The multi-faceted images of Mount Tai encompassed the many different, apparently conflicting emotions and thoughts that welled in his mind. As he gazed at the mountain, he found himself. Conclusion The difficulties and ambiguities of "Wang yue" have inspired many discussions and interpretations. As we have seen, the question of determining the "correct" inter- pretations is a more complex problem than has been thought. Different and, at first sight, contradictory explanations coexist. Du Fu is gazing up at Mount Tai, his breast heaving at the sight of the emerging layered clouds. At the same time he is up among the clouds and mists, his breast brushed and nurtured by the life-giving breath of Mount Tai. He is also a bird that has been shot, his breast heaving, gasping his last. The poem is a gesture of strength and bravado, but also an expression of weariness and retreat. His images and his syntax are deliberately ambiguous, in order to cap- ture the complexities of his thoughts and feelings. Du Fu reminds us that it is possi- ble, and very human, to feel and think at one moment quite different thoughts and emotions. His lines can and were meant to be read in different ways. In this study, I have attempted to reconcile a number of the traditional and modernm interpretations, as well as add new readings. Above all, I have tried to explain the rationale of Du Fu's ambiguity by first describing the personal setting that created his thoughts and feelings, then exploring the manner in which they guided Du Fu's vision. Admittedly the reading that has been presented is difficult and not always apparent, but the signs that point to such a reading are insistent. Du Fu's striking imagery and language have not been fully accounted for by previous explanations; they are invitations to explore. At the same time, however, my reading has been guided by certain</page><page sequence="16">16 Chinese Literature, Essays, Articles, Reviews 16 (1994) principles. I have simply asked what Du Fu may have been thinking and feeling at a distinct point in his life, and I have attempted to identify the building blocks avail- able to him when he composed his poem-images, symbols, traditions, and prece- dents-all the elements that shaped Du Fu's vision and in turn were reshaped in his verse. It is by identifying such fundamental facts as the historical setting of the poem, the meanings of Mount Tai, the crucial impact of the exams on poets56 and their poetry, the traditional images and lore associated with the exams, and the literary traditions and precedents that Du Fu was heir to, that we can attempt to recreate his world and understand how his poem works. Once we are aware of this evidence, the explanation of "Wang yue" presented here begins to make sense. As the poem's structural logic and internal harmony become clear, it takes on a new life, becoming a deeper and even greater work than has been previously recognized. In closing I would like to comment on the rationale of the technique and art seen in "Wang yue," and the place of Du Fu's poem in the historical context. Du Fu was a poet of the High Tang, the great classical age of Chinese verse. One of the distin- guishing features of a poetry in its "classical" stages is a sense of restraint. A classical style is in part characterized by the things it refrains from talking about, or the re- straint with which it deals with certain matters and avoids extremes of expression. In short it is guided by a certain degree of decorum and propriety. In Chinese poetics, the phrase "ai er bu shang" [i. ("grief not carried to the point of self-injury"), originally used by Confucius to praise the first song in the Shi jing, indicates the value placed on a sense of decorum.57 One of the fascinating aspects of "Wang yue" is the way in which it treads the line between classical restraint and the excess that would characterize certain types of post-High Tang verse.58 Mid-Tang poets such as Meng Jiao composed during a period when the stan- dards of decorum and restraint of an earlier age had apparently broken down. Meng Jiao's poetry in particular could never be mistaken for Early or High Tang verse. The painful ranting, the directness, the violent-almost paranoid-vision of the world, would have been practically inconceivable earlier. Meng Jiao's verse was admittedly an extreme example of Mid-Tang poetry that later ages would recoil from, but even Han Yu's work possesses a certain prosaic frankness that earlier poets ordinarily would have avoided. But it is precisely their outspokenness and frankness that make them so informative. For example, we understand better the pain, injury, and disap- pointment of a failed candidate from Mid-Tang works because they spoke freely where earlier poets would have remained silent or whispered. There was a place for sorrow, complaint and dispute in Early and High Tang verse, but in general decorum and propriety prevailed. We saw Chen Zi'ang, after failing the exams, comparing himself to a drifting tumbleweed and a stricken bird. But these metaphors were old and hallowed ones, their original force long since worn smooth, and in a way this 5 Yoshikawa Kojir6 has suggested that Du Fu not only memorized the text of the Wen xuan, but Li Shan's T- (c. 630-690) commentary as well; Yoshikawa KOjir6, "Tu Fu's Poetics and Poetry," Acta Asiat- ica 16 (1969): 9. The Song critic, Wu Zeng 4e, notes that Bo Juyi ngt-lJ (772-846) was familiar with wang, using it in one of his poems in imitation of Tao Yuanming, but that Wei Yingwu $819) (c.737-c.791) uses jian in a couplet that alludes to Tao's poem.

They were clear and direct, but safe in that they remained within the proper bounds. Du Fu's poem lies somewhere between the classical tradition of High Tang poets such as Wang Wei and such mid-Tang poets as Meng Jiao and Li He. In "Wang Yue" he is moving in directions that would eventually lead to the mid-Tang, and later. The frank, deeply personal tone, the startling, violent images, and the daring language are characteristically his. We see that Du Fu, even in his youth, was in advance of his era, going beyond convention and revitalizing the tradition. For him it is not enough to say that he is a stricken bird; rather he is a bird whose eye-sockets have been split, a bird that longs to return to Mount Tai. The image is a fresh, powerful restatement of what had been a convention. It is difficult to imagine any previous poet conceiving such an image. It is important to note, however, that Du Fu, in his own way, contin- ued to be guided by a sense of restraint and balance. He still does not say things out loud, and has compressed his thoughts and feelings in a series of shifting, interlocked images and allusions that balance each other. It thus can be suggested that Du Fu's ambiguity was, in this case, more than a poetic technique, but can also be seen as a kind of restraint, a way of taming and masking the powerful emotions that lay be- hind his poem. Most important, Du Fu chose to compose his poem not as a pure complaint or lament, but at a moment when he was able to come to terms with his failure, when he was able to balance and reconcile light with dark, and his desire to retreat with his resolve to go forward. There is pain in Du Fu, but it is restrained, suppressed, and finally overcome. Through poetry it is transformed, and emerges in a different and more noble form. Du Fu's "strength" was not solely a matter of individual character. If one can speak of High Tang poets as being greater than Mid- and Late Tang poets, it is in part because history and tradition provided them with a foundation that was denied to later poets. In Du Fu's time, the standards of propriety and decorum that had devel- oped over centuries were still in force. Most poets acknowledged them naturally and unconsciously. Of course propriety and decorum in themselves do not guarantee good poetry; in fact, in the High Tang we can see traditional standards being bent and stretched, and it can be argued that it is precisely periods such as this that pro- duce great poetry. Poets such as Du Fu and Li Bo, in their individual ways, pushed the rules and standards and at times went beyond them. The point, however, is that the tradition still held power. Part of the force and strength of a poem such as "Wang yue" lies in the tension between the demands of a tradition that advocated restraint and the powerful, extreme feelings of the individual. In this instance they are in balance, a kind of harmony has been achieved. But one senses that the balance is delicate, and that if it were upset, the effects could be likened to the bursting of a dam. Mid-Tang poets belonged to a different world from that of Li Bo, Wang Wei, and Du Fu. The catastrophes that had begun in 755 had drastically altered China. There had been a "fall," the old standards and traditions had broken down. Unchecked, poets such as Meng Jiao and Li He were free to pursue their personal visions of a world gone wrong. Not all writers succumbed: Han Yu is the great example of a man who struggled to revive and uphold tradition. In him one senses a strength of charac- ter and optimism (and perhaps naivetd) that provides a striking contrast to his friend Meng Jiao. The Song poet, Su Shi, presents a somewhat similar impression. But at</page><page sequence="18">18 Chinese Literature, Essays, Articles, Reviews 16 (1994) times one cannot help but feel that the apparent strength, assurance and optimism of men such as Han Yu and Su Shi were in part the result of individual effort and will, as if they were struggling to keep at bay dangerous forces that preyed on them all too easily. There is the individual, but there is also history and time. We stand in awe of the High Tang poets, and acknowledge that they are greater than the generations that followed. Yet we also recognize that they were not just individuals, but stages in a process. Decay and fall are inevitable; poets, as part of this process, take the steps and directions that are offered them. Du Fu was a great poet in part because the times let him become great. Poets may struggle against time, and we may admire their efforts, which can be heroic in the case of a Han Yu or a Su Shi. But even they were inevitably marked by time, and denied the classical balance and strength that was granted to an earlier generation. Chinese poetry, for the most part, was the product of a certain class of educated, adult males. Although poets began their training as children, they were inevitably guided into writing "adult" poetry. The available occasions, topics, and sub-genres, such as parting poems, poems on history, eulogies, and personal laments, belonged to the realm of literate adult males whose poetry often matured and improved as they grew older. Occasionally, however, one can still catch glimpses of youth in poetry. The examinations, so crucial in the lives of the literati, were usually first taken by young men. One can think of them as a rite of passage. The pain and disappoint- ment associated with the exams-this first encounter with adult realities-sometimes found their way into poetry. The results could show particular force and violence, and push the tradition to its limits. In "Gazing at the Mountain" we not only see Du Fu poised between youth and adulthood, but also Tang poetry-Chinese po- etry-poised at an edge, an early hint of the classical tradition beginning to be threat- ened. Du Fu stretches the tradition, yet continues to adhere to it, taking it into new worlds and new heights, but also balancing it on a brink, ready to fall from its classi- cal moral poise and restraint. The conflicts, pressures, and strange, powerful, won- derful shapes and images that resulted are part of Du Fu's greatness. They are also signs of impending and inevitable change. And when history and time inevitably took their toll, it was the legacy of Du Fu above all that would provide a direction for the poets who followed.</page></plain_text>
