Von : Der Held im deutschen und rus sischen M?rchen. Jena, E. Diederichs, 1912, 139 pp. M3. Siuts's investigation is the enlarged form of a prize essay on the " Hades-Journey " type of the German popular tale. The purpose is to show the great importance of the popular ideas of the "other world" (fairyland, the land of wonders in whatever form) for the proper understanding of the M?rchen and for the appreciation of its value for the history of Teutonic religion. The bulk of the book consists of direct quotations from the texts of Volksm?rchen (in the strict sense) ; thus the author is able to make his work clear to the reader at once. These passages are arranged according to an elaborate system, fol lowing the hero of the M?rchen step by step on the journey from the land of the living. First we are informed as to the situation of the "Beyond" ("realm of the departed"), the distance to it as stated in various tales, the way thither, the border regions (great forest, waters, or mountains, etc., the inhabitants and their abode, etc. ). Next we have the descrip tion of the other world itself which may be conceived as under the earth or water, within or upon a mountain, or, rarely, "Hades" may be in heaven (p. 58,245; or p. 302, as in "Marienkind," Grimm No. 3, through the influence of Chris tian legend). We get a view of the castle or other dwelling, its exterior, interior and surroundings. The inhabitants of that world are discussed under the headings of theriomorphism, transition to anthropomorphism and from that in certain cases to spiritualization. Ritualistic and other chthonic motives are likewise considered. The last seventy-five pages contain the essay proper, parallel in arrangement to the material of Part I. By comparing the variants of various tales Siuts attempts to arrive at the origin of the motives. A few examples follow. Food on the table in the enchanted dwelling is interpreted as pointing back to offerings once made for the departed; the treasures there are objects once buried with the dead ; a con nection is assumed (p. 257, Note 1) between the glass or flask containing the strengthening potion, of which the hero par takes in some tales, and the drinking-vessels found in ancient graves ; seven-league boots go back to the shoes once placed in graves; etc. Of course S. is careful to state that not all the numerous other-world conception he discusses are still understood as such, and that there has been a continual process of fading and</page><page sequence="2">478 Williams modernization. But in my opinion he often goes too far in identifying other-world motives and does not allow enough for what the imagination of story-tellers has added ; variants arising in this way may easily be more widely spread than he assumes. Just here there is need of comparison with the Volksm?rchen in other languages which could not be done in this work. The unique classification of the motives is some what overdone. One feels that very many confident asser tions in the essay proper should have been qualified by a "probably." L?wis of Menar limits his study to the hero (or heroine) of the popular tales of wonder and magic in Germany and Russia. In general he finds the Russian tales more consciously artistic than the German ; the language is archaic to a greater degree ; there is a fondness for dialog ; details are presented so fully as to leave much less for the imagination of the hearer than in the German stories. The Russians like to ascribe to their hero a superhuman origin and to give him a fanciful name. In both countries the hero of the Zauberm'?rchen is most often a prince, a peasant's son or a soldier but outside of these types there is much less variety in Russian stories. In the latter, sons or daughters of priests are not seldom the chief figures,?not so in Germany, owing no doubt to the influence of the Roman church during the formative period of the German M?rchen. The church is however scarcely ever men tioned in the German stories considered here but the Russian hero is strict in religious matters in not a few tales. There is a much greater variety of subordinate figures in the Russian stories, making the action rather too complex. University of Illinois C. A. Williams.</page></plain_text>
