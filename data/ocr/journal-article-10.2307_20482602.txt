ISBN: 978-0-19-923038-9. doi: 10 1017/S0009840X08001297 Hamilakis is one of the few scholars studying the reception of ancient Greece using a real diversity of material remains (including sites, monuments and moveable artefacts of prehistoric, as well as Classical, date). Combining ethnographic and sociological data with primary documentary and visual culture, he covers a rare diachronic range of receiving societies - mainly within Greece, where the remains have an especially strong resonance, different in many respects from that applying in western Europe. These extremely important and novel angles of research are now combined in a highly readable and important book (based partly on earlier articles) for reception scholars and those researching Greek history and prehistory. After an introduction touching on heritage presentation in the 2004 Athens Olympics, and a short chapter on the structuring/management of heritage in Greece today, a long key chapter covers reference to the Classical past in the emergence of Greek national independence and related thought. Following chapters cover the sociopolitical context and impact of the findings by Manolis Andronikos at Vergina; manipulation of notions of history and ethnicity under the Metaxas dictatorship; the The Classical Review vol. 58 no. 2 ?

A new commentary on the Elgin marbles controversy benefits from the book's broader context. Each study is compelling in showing how very differently loaded the same heritage has been at different points in the fairly recent past. Though a linear structure is avoided, the studies are underpinned with a lucid narrative of long-term changes in attitudes to heritage in Greece, Major themes include the historically close intertwining of para-colonial with nationalist understandings and agendas in regard to Greek heritage; the emergence in Greece during the nineteenth century of a bottom-up 'indigenous Hellenism', embracing the Byzantine past as well as the Classical past focussed on by western societies; the long-established attribution of anthropomorphic qualities and kin-like relationship with the nation to antiquities in Greece, and the 'sacralisation' of heritage at an everyday level there, with archaeologists functioning as 'priests'. Two arguments made about nationalism are (1) that the integration of heritage in nationalism can be a grassroots-based, organic and stabilising process, not necessarily a highly artificial, top-down activity: scholars should seek to understand it fully instead of using its deconstruction to attack 'native' cultures; (2) despite the advent of globalisation, nationalism is not dying, and material heritage continues to play a central role in its construction. A major claim made for the study is that it undermines the idea of heritage as a simple instrumental tool of nationalism and other modern political agendas, in suggesting that 'premodern' attitudes influence Greek interactions with heritage to an enriching and selective extent. The existence of a complex plurality of affective factors in the construction, understanding and 'feeling' of heritage over time is stressed, against the reductionism/functionalism that H. perceives as dominant in the literature. Issues arise about standpoint in humanistic writing, as in some other recent work by Greek emigre scholars claiming to act as participant observers on their home territory. Though H.'s own Greek background clearly provides excellent oppor tunities for in-depth research and special insight on that region, many readers will have a broad base of comparative knowledge about heritage construction and consumption, which could be engaged with more to achieve the ambitious aims outlined in the first part of the Preface. Notwithstanding the statement (pp. 9-10) that the book is not fixed in a single discipline, any truly influential sociological analysis, cultural history or anthropological study must make reference to a rich comparative factual base. The book would have greater weight if it dissected the contributions of its forerunners in more specialised disciplines in greater detail, and developed explicit new research methods and directions on this basis. Allowing assertion to permeate academic texts under the banner of authorial 'situatedness' has little place outside an extreme relativist perspective: reflexive passages need to be highlighted and examined explicitly to be really valuable. Here, though, we are sometimes asked to accept the author's assertions within the discussion, on the basis of the book's general claim to be a situated account. In the Andronikos chapter, the controversial issue of internal colonialism surrounding the Macedonian question is raised, but detailed dissection avoided (despite the avowed interest in addressing colonial perspectives on heritage) in favour of some rather bland assertions, e.g. 'In Greece names matter. In Macedonia they matter even more' (p. 152). The analysis of Andronikos's motivations in heritage manipulation highlights his personal political beliefs and 'dreams' in a surprisingly uncritical way,</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 587 presumably in support of the general argument against instrumentalist or reductionist views; reference is made to Andronikos's 'sacred mission' and his serving of the nation's 'need', with the assertion that 'most [Greeks] will be immensely thankful' (p. 164) added without further support. In contrast, in the Elgin marbles chapter, the para-colonial activities and outlooks of 'western' societies are deeply deconstructed and critiqued. Here too, assertions and judgements are sprinkled in without a balanced, explicit basis of argument. A systematic exploration of how different communities perceive and consume the marbles in their current location would be especially interesting here, and would add balance, given the depth of investigation into the nature of Greeks' attachment to them. Some unevenness and reductionism is seen in throwaway references to the concepts of 'the west' and 'colonialism'. The generalising tone again contrasts harshly with the subtle detail in which Greek responses to and structuring of heritage are studied. On p. 167 H. sets up a false premise (the notion that Greek archaeologists operate 'outside modernity') simply in order to contradict it, yet comments (without any specific follow-up point) that such a premise is 'ethically and politically suspect, a well-known strategy of the colonial imagination'. In the Makronisos study, a minor explanation about the Greek state's use of islands for political rehabilitation is linked to 'the western intellectual and political idea that sees isolated islands as appropriate "laboratories"'; again, the point hangs loosely. Are these attempts to keep tying the book's observations as a whole to a 'postcolonial' critique? If so, they backfire, diminishing the sense of a balanced historical perspective in favour of a heavily situated view. Imbalance and superficiality appear in the minimal fleshing-out of some case studies. The very interesting analysis of Greek conceptions of heritage in the context of a high-tech, globalised society, mainly via reference to the Ministry of Culture website (pp. 287-9), does not make the fullest use of the author's special expertise: a review of some other Greek web-based heritage presentations of 'official' and 'unofficial' type would be useful. In the Elgin marbles chapter, sets of very precise factual details appear in some places, but only brief references in others, mixing the impression of an educational account with that of an advanced commentary. Some interpretations seem superficially treated. The idea of a 'shamanistic' approach to the past seems overstated on the basis of the Andronikos case study alone. H. could have developed the general idea of exceptionally strong personal and emotional attachment to monuments in Greek culture, including professional culture, without the explicit link to shamanism, or supported the 'shaman' idea better by citing other examples of quasi-mystical outlooks on heritage by Greek archaeologists, which do exist. Using blocks of italicised text in the present tense to 'reconstruct' past events at which the author was sometimes present, but is sometimes only imagining himself to have been present, blurs assertion and fact further, underestimating readers' imaginative powers. These passages may be trying to remind us of the author's situated perspective, or to illustrate a sense of personal closeness to heritage. H. describes them as 'attempts to evoke a moment, an instance, an encounter, a dense social performance', claiming 'these key revelatory moments are too important to my argument here to be described in a conventional academic style' (pp. 24-5). Yet the usually pedestrian nature of the texts undermines this claim. One example records H.'s participation in a demonstration against the Elgin marbles' presence in the UK (pp. 243-4): he records his own feelings at length, but with no obvious following</page><page sequence="4">588 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW point. The short, unexceptional description of Andronikos' funeral (pp. 125-6) could equally well have been included within the main text. In the stimulating and valuable conclusions, one missed opportunity concerns potential application of the results of the research and a sense of where heritage perceptions are going in Greece today. In dealing with the material dimension of heritage and its remarkable power, it makes sense to look at how the habitus is still evolving, and at the political and practical implications. Major issues affecting the management, consumption and manipulation of heritage, with strong roots in the book's themes, are only briefly raised (e.g. the destruction of monuments during Olympics-related building): few ideas appear on how the scholarly perspective can help resolve them. H. could offer great insight on the implications of Greeks' unusually personalised relationship to their heritage for antiquities looting and trade, and on the long-term impact of 'the west's' para-colonial involvement with Greek heritage on the role of foreign institutions and individuals working with Greek heritage. Deeper investigation of antiquities' role as economic resources, and exploitative patterns developed in this connection, would be welcome. Given the political centrality of heritage, its high accessibility, and the distinctive acceptance of the need and right to 'feel' heritage in Greece today, what special positive features regarding protection of, and education on, heritage have emerged there? How easily might these be borrowed elsewhere? Given the argument (pp. 12-15) that nationalist constructs of heritage have intrinsic value and the 'western' dichotomy of authentic, scientifically documentable heritage and inauthentic or manipulated heritage is false, the question who currently defines authenticity in Greece, and how widely their right to do so is accepted, seems worth addressing. This lack of argued judgements on issues of pragmatic interest is at odds with the book's claim to a politically engaged viewpoint (though H. may be saving them for other works). Brave and ambitious enough to deconstruct the complex, sensitive and controversial historical issues around Greek heritage for an international audience, he might have achieved a more politically influential book by building a broader comparative base, developing stronger dialogue with related studies conducted outside Greece, and adopting a more evaluative, problem-solving approach to current hot issues.
