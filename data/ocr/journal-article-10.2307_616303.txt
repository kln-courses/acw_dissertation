Oxford: Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 1977. ?6. The Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, since their inception in 1908, have well served the purpose for which they were established, both by general surveys of aspects of Ancient Civilizations with reference to Bible Study, and by up-to-date reports of new discoveries impinging on this field. It is very timely that the Hittites should receive the attention of this series for the first time since Hogarth (Kings of the Hittites, 1924) and Cowley (The Hittites, 1918), a period when ' Hittitology' was still in its earliest stages. It is also most appropriate that it should be the religion of the Hittites which should be selected for consideration and that Professor 0. R. Gurney should have been invited to give the lectures. The religion of the Hittites is one of the best-known aspects of their civilization, since it is such a central preoccupation of so many of the transmitted texts. Archaeological investi- gation of the temples and the recovery of some of the cultic paraphernalia has helped to flesh out the picture drawn from the texts, as do also representations in sculpture and glyptic. The topic has generated a substantial biblio- graphy, as is shown by the very useful one accompanying the work under review, and many scholars of distinction have addressed themselves to general surveys of the subject, as noted below, following Gurney's system of reference. Besides one monograph now ageing (Furlani, 1936), the subject has been tackled in a number of symposia on ancient religions (Dussaud, 1945; Giiterbock, 1949; Otten, 1961 and 1964; Kiimmel, 1973), or by scholars within the context of their own or joint studies on the Hittites (Goetze, 1933/1957; Gurney, The Hittites (Penguin, 1952), ch. vii: Riem- schneider, 1954; Giiterbock, 1964; Klengel, Die Hethiter (Leipzig, 1970), 135-72; Mac- queen, 1975). At the same time, the process of publication of the new texts, the edition with commentaries of texts long known, and the completion of studies on selected themes continue apace, and these contributions accumulate with sufficient rapidity to necessitate periodic re-evaluations of the topic. The publication of Gurney's lectures a year after their delivery is thus to be welcomed both for its re-examination of links and parallels between the Hittite and Ancient Hebrew religions and for its review of the current state of knowledge of the former, including the most recent developments and advances in the general field of Hittitology. The aspects of Hittite religion handled in the three chapters (lectures) are Pantheon, Cult, and Magical Rituals, under which headings in fact the whole range of the subject can be subsumed. In the study of the Pan- theon, new perspectives are acquired as a result of recent work on the dating of texts, and in particular by the sharper focus in which the earlier material may now be viewed, thereby permitting a clearer view of diachronic development to be taken. The various in- fluences contributing to the highly syncretistic pantheon can be better identified and dated: the combination of the earliest, inherited Indo- European deities with the indigenous Hattian ones, as seen in the oldest texts; the position of Kaneshite and Luwian gods; and the gradual Hurrianization of the pantheon at a late date in the Empire period, as reflected in the iconography of Yazilhkaya. In this last regard, Gurney is able to utilize the most recent views on the readings of the Yazilhkaya epigraphs (Giiterbock, 1975). On the earlier stages of the pantheon, one may note that a recent study (Starke, ZA, 69 (1979), 47-120) suggests a radical reappraisal of the data, but even if this thesis is accepted, it will extend rather than contradict Gurney's picture. The chapter on the Cult makes use of the recent reconstructions of the outlines of the great seasonal festivals of the spring and autumn, and attempts a survey and interpreta- tion of the activities prescribed in these lengthy but banal texts. The ANTAH?UM, purulli and nuntariyalha festivals were already known in outline, and in the period since Gurney's work another major study (on the KILAM festival) has been completed (Singer, doctoral thesis, Tel Aviv University, 1978" soon to be published in the StBoT series), which will further enlarge the picture. Studies on the religious reforms of Tudhaliya IV and the associated cult-inventories have extended our knowledge of the cultic equipment, and in particular the part played by the huwagi- stones (compared by Gurney with the Hebrew ma8iboth), and by cult images both therio- and anthropomorphic. Among the Magical Rituals those con- cerning transference of evil are selected for consideration because of their relevance to the Old Testament, and also the related rituals of substitution recently edited (Kfimmel, 1967). Recent theories on the identification and purpose of Yazilhkaya are reviewed, i.e. whether it was indeed the ' henti-house ' and/or the mortuary temple of Tudhaliya. In the three years since it has appeared, this book has proved itself very useful for teaching and reference. It would be welcome if Pro- fessor Gurney, in his retirement, would give us other such valuable syntheses on aspects of Hittite civilization. .1. 1). HAWKINS</page></plain_text>
