Central to the interpretation of Euripides' Heracles is this notorious passage in which the hero denies the truth of certain 'wretched tales' about the gods and then proceeds to assert that 'God if truly god needs nothing'. Since these verses call into question the funda- mental presuppositions of the plot, interpreters have adopted a range of strategies to explain them or explain them away. Their views may be categorised broadly as follows. 1. There is no contradiction between the god of these verses and the traditional gods of the play. 2. Such a contradiction does exist, but the verses are extradramat- ic, being irrelevant to character and context and possibly an intru- sion of Euripides' own religious views. 3. The verses are in character and relevant to the immediate con- text, but their possibly subversive implications in the wider context of the play as a whole should be disregarded. 4. The passage is in character and relevant in the immediate con- text. Its wider implications within the play should indeed be disre- garded in order to avoid an internal contradiction. Nevertheless, the spectator is encouraged to reflect on the possible truth of Heracles' radical theology outside of the dramatic illusion, so that an ironical relationship is established between the spectator's reality and the world of the play. ?

Heracles' views in this passage, whatever their theological or philosophical implications, are simply mistaken in the play's terms and their implications outside the play are irrelevant. 6. The contradiction exists but can be resolved terminologically, for Heracles accepts the reality of the traditional gods as represented in the play while refusing, on moral grounds, to call them gods. 7. Heracles implicitly denies the traditional gods, and rightly so, thereby invalidating his own myth. The play becomes an impossible fiction, unrepresentative of reality and irrelevant to the audience's experience. 8. The play's world is a self-contradictory one in which the tradi- tional gods do and do not exist, but either (a) the contradiction is muted, though sufficient to encourage us to read the gods as sym- bols of t??? or the like, or (b) the contradiction has its full force and is indeed a deliberate strategy by which the reality of the ear- lier scenes is converted into a new reality. 9. Heracles' god is true for the play and incompatible with the Olympians, so that we are invited to deny that the traditional gods exist even on the literal level of plot and action. This bizarre and deservedly notorious theory of A.W. Verrall has long been discre- dited. The reader will therefore be spared a rehearsal of its defects1). Let us now examine each of the other views. 1. Some would have it that Heracles' theological critique applies only to the gods' mutual relations and that Zeus' adultery with the mortal Alcmene?one of the plot's major presuppositions?is not at issue2). Against this restriction of the passage's reference Halleran has recendy argued that "Theseus' words reply to and even echo the end of Herakles' speech, his condemnation of Hera in which he refers to this union.... And i) Four Plays of Euripides (Cambridge 1905). 2) See G.M.A. Grube, The Drama of Euripides (London 1941), 58: "there are no adulterous relationships between gods.... [Heracles] does not explicitly deny the story of his own birth; the audience, even the poet, may not have been alive to the impli- cations, because in their own day there must have been many who would accept myths about the divine birth of Heracles without a murmur but who would never accept the cruder stories of immorality on Olympus" (Grube's emphasis).

True, he does not refer specifically to his own circumstances, but in replying to Theseus' assertions, he echoes his earlier condemnation of Hera's sexual jealousy, the condemnation that concluded his previous speech. And Hera's anger at Zeus' adul- tery motivates the entire action of the drama"3). We might add that Amphitryon earlier had quite specifically rebuked Zeus for his adultery, though he would not perhaps have raised the issue had the god proven a true (piXos (339-47). But whether or not one agrees (as I do) with Halleran, Heracles' culminating assertion about the truly divine god remains problem- atical, for how could one contend that the gods of the play have no needs? Burnett, at least, has no difficulty reconciling such a god with the divinities of the play so long as we are not required to attribute to Hera so base a motive as sexual jealousy4). Unfortunately the tra- dition attributes just that motive to the goddess, as does Heracles himself (1309 f.), though Burnett thinks that Heracles' suicidal despair has warped his judgment. Against this it must be said that neither Theseus nor anyone else ever disputes Heracles' interpreta- tion of the goddess' motives, though Burnett sees Hera's ????? (840) as inspired by a sort of divine f????? quite untainted by sexual jeal- ousy. Now f????? may be implied in the ambiguous 841 f.5); but that motive would not necessarily preclude sexual jealousy. If f????? lies behind Iris' words at 841 f, Lyssa answers her in assert- ing that Heracles, far from encroaching on divine prerogatives, has actually upheld the t??a? of the gods6). This could be countered only by the argument that Heracles' intentions and even positive services to the gods do not cancel the greater threat that his super- human achievements represent7).

So Hera's moti- vation would remain morally indefensible, even if we could rule out sexual jealousy. And even if the goddess's conduct could be justi- fied, it would still be hard to reconcile any polytheism, however refined, with Heracles' independent god9). K.H. Lee has adopted a diff?rent strategy to cope with the god that has no needs. He takes the words to mean no more than that "the gods get what they want"10), but this is not a legitimate para- phrase. To have no needs is scarcely synonymous with having needs that are never permanently frustrated, and the idea of a god that needs nothing appears in Xenophon as a contrast to the life of lux- ury and extravagance11). The point there at least is the absence of desires rather than their unfrustrated fulfilment. It is implausible that Heracles is referring at all to the traditional gods; the tone of the passage suggests contemporary philosophy12). In the words of Guthrie, "[b]esides moral probity, self-sufficiency was being demanded as an essential property of deity. Aided perhaps by Xenophanes and Eleatic notions of God as 'unmoved' and 'impas- sible', the rationalism of the time saw the godhead as 'lacking noth- ing'13). In sum, we must grant the radical incompatibility of Hera- cles' gods with the gods of the play. 2. The view that the passage is wholly extradramatic is apt to look like a convenient evasion.

On the other hand, we cannot assume that ancient feelings about artistic unity were identical to our own, and I have yet to be con- vinced that Hecuba's philosophical Zeus at Troades 884-88 is rele- vant either to the immediate context or to the play as a whole14). Even so, extradramatic explanations should only be invoked provi- sionally, and in the case of our passage the tactic is misguided, for the discussion with Theseus is closely germane to the question of the hero's orientation to the world in which he decides to continue to Uve15). 3. The soft version of the extradramatic view allows the verses a limited relevance in the context16). For example, according to Heath, Heracles is indeed replying to Theseus' comments (as pro- ponents of the first view agree), and the implications of 1345 f. are radically subversive of the traditional gods of the play. But the audi- ence would not have been expected to trace the wider implica- tions17). Moreover, Heath raises a disturbing and important objec- tion to allowing the lines to resonate with their full force: "... if we do not accept this limitation of relevance, we shall be com- pelled to accept that Euripides was willing to destroy the effect of a scene of the highest tension and pathos by taking over a character in order to remind the audience?quite irrelevantly?that the story he 14) As K.H. Lee remarks (Euripides, Troades [London 1976], ad he), "the var- ious names given this controlling power are patendy undramatic, being a reflection of the influence of contemporary speculation on Euripides' own thought" and "Menelaus' surprise at Hecuba's revolutionary ideas is an attempt on Euripides' part to remedy the anachronism in the previous lines". To speculate on the philo- sophical implications of these views or the extent of their compatibility with tradi- tional religious ideas (see, e.g. C. Chromik, G?ttlicher Anspruch und Menschliche Verantwortung bei Euripides [Diss. Kiel 1967], 206-18; M.R. Lefkowitz, "Impiety" and "Atheism" in Euripides' Dramas, CQ,39 [1989], 70-82, at 72 f.) does litde to explain their relevance. 15) See below, p. 15. 16) See Halleran (n. 3) 178 f.: "Herakles' statement does make sense in context and on the level of character: a proud man's response to Theseus' arguments and his own plight.... But although Herakles rejects the view espoused ... at 1340 if., the audience need not.... They, unlike the character Herakles, are free to evaluate it." 17) Heath (n. 3), 61.

Stinton, Si credere dignum est: some expressions of disbelief in Euripides and others, PC PS 22 (1976), 60-89, at 82-84 [= Collected Papers 262-4], that Heracles is merely expressing disapproval of the gods and not disbelief in them.</page><page sequence="6">134 S.E. LAWRENCE has chosen to dramatize is in reality not credible"18). However, the fact remains that we are so reminded, even if we agree, like obedient jurors, to 'disregard that remark' while as spec- tators we are immersed in the dramatic illusion; and the conse- quence of having heard the remark is, as for a jury, a kind of awk- ward ambivalence. We may feel that Heracles' conception of the true god is true for the real world, though false for the play, that is within the restricted parameters which we as spectators (again like the jury) have implicitly agreed to accept. 4. This brings us to our fourth category, Halleran's view that the full resonance of the lines is indeed extradramatic, the result being an ironic interplay between the world of the drama and our own world, or at least world-view19). Similarly, Vickers believes that Euripides is not attacking the gods but human views of them, views which have to be accepted as dramatic presuppositions: "We might prefer to believe in a true god ... but we cannot deny that both Heracles himself and the whole represented action of the play are not poets' lies but exist before us." Vickers suggests that Euripides may well have wanted this dilemma left unresolved in order to pro- voke us "to see the absurdities inherent in anthropomorphic myths of the gods". Michelini remarks that in "the plane of the play's mimesis of reality, what Herakles says is patendy untrue", but with "the overt reference to the possibility that the ????? of the poets may be false, we are forced to consider that Herakles itself... is also a mere fiction"20). Now with Halleran, Vickers and Michelini we are teetering before the abyss of Greenwood's fantasy theory, the notion that the play is an impossible fiction and to be clearly recog- nised as such by the audience21), though Greenwood leaves the play strangely meaningless, while Halleran and Vickers find meaning in the interaction, as it were, of the play's impossible world-view with that of the spectator. This, like Greenwood's theory, necessarily entails a certain detachment from the dramatic illusion itself, since 18) Heath (?. 3), 61. 19) Halleran (?. 3), 179 f. 20) ?.

This is unfortunate, for they are relevant to the hero's reorientation to life. 5. The theory that Heracles' view is mistaken seems at first sight an elegantly simple solution to the dilemma. It is a view that partially overlaps with (4) since, if (as Halleran and Vickers hold) the gods of tradition are presuppositions of the play, Heracles' philosophical god is false for the play22). According to Lee, as we saw, the true god of Heracles is merely the god who gets what he wants and therefore is compatible in principle with the Olympians23). However, in Lee's opinion, Heracles is wrong and the gods are not fully in control, but, as Iris and Lyssa convey to us in the peripety, act "as and when they can"24). Foley, on the other hand, equivocates somewhat between the view that Heracles is merely criticising the traditional gods and the idea that he is denying their existence outright in an act of "redemptive self-delusion" that "remasks" the gods in "incompre- hensibility", for he does not wish to live with the (true) notion of unjust gods25). Mastronarde, however, asserts unequivocally that the verses "do not merely express disapproval, they express a wilful (and wishful) rejection", but he agrees with Foley in seeing Heracles as in a way deluded: "the psychological reflex of a good man defiant- ly insisting on imposing an ideal order and morality on experi- ence"26). But a closer look at Heracles' truly divine god will show that the hero is not in fact imposing "an ideal order and morality on expe- rience", for the god who needs nothing is as remote from human experience as the gods of Aristode or Epicurus27). Such a deity does not mitigate the evil of the world one jot. Had Heracles posited a 22) See ?. 19, 20 above. 23) See ?. 10 above. 24) Lee (n. 10), 45. 25) Foley (n. 5), 165. See also 197. 26) DJ.

LAWRENCE benign and helpful divinity, his own experience would indeed have refuted him, but this god is, as Heracles says about Theseus' reli- gious remarks, 'irrelevant' (p??e??a, 1340) to his concerns. The behaviour imputed to the Olympians is irrelevant because untrue, while the true god is irrelevant because he is totally aloof. What Heracles has effectively done here is to emancipate himself from a literal belief in the traditional gods without self-deceivingly substi- tuting a more optimistic theology in the form of an actively benev- olent god. But there is a deeper difficulty with the position that the tradi- tional gods must be regarded as real in the teeth of Heracles' implic- it assertion to the contrary, for this can only work if the spectator is prepared to play by what we (rightly or wrongly) consider the rules of the game, which require that we accept the play's literal world as long as we are responding as spectators suspending disbe- lief like the jurors who wilfully disregard what they are told to dis- regard. Such rules are hard enough for a jury to observe. An audi- ence will surely proceed in a much more unruly and unreflecting fashion, importing their own views into the play if invited to do so, even if these are, stricdy speaking, irrelevant and even subversive. To allow one's own assumptions and beliefs to reassert themselves surreptitiously is easier than to say: "I know this is true, but I must agree to think it false." 6. Perhaps the simplest and most elegant solution of all is the view that the whole issue is one of terminology. Heracles is not denying Zeus, Hera, Iris, Lyssa or any of the mythic events of the play and its background?he is merely refusing to call such beings gods in the full sense28). If this were so, however, Heracles would have expressed his criticisms rather differently. Instead of denying that the gods commit adultery and chain one another, he could have conceded the truth of such stories and disputed the application of the term god to the supernatural beings that figure in them in the way that the nurse in the Hippolytus does not deny the destructive power of Cypris, but asserts that she is something more than a god {Hipp. 359-61). Heracles might have said: "Yes, Theseus, these tales are true enough, and they confirm my experience that leads me to 28) Desch (?. 7), 20 f.</page><page sequence="9">THE GOD AND THE UNIVERSE OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES 137 conclude that the so-called gods are unjust. But though these beings indubitably exist, let us cease to call them gods, for an unjust god is a contradiction in terms". However, not only does Heracles express himself in a way that suggests that he regards the stories as wholly fictitious, but he goes on to propose a sophisticated notion of divinity which, while it is not logically incompatible with the co- existence of the Olympians, certainly sorts ill with them. 7. Greenwood's fantasy theory was mentioned earlier, but I have postponed discussion of it because one of its corollaries leads us to our eighth category. Greenwood, we saw, dismisses the play as an impossible fiction on the ground that the passage in question ren- ders its traditional mythic and religious presuppositions utterly absurd29). The idea that the drama suffers from internal contradic- tion would seem to lend weight to the theory. But an important consequence of the fantasy view is that the play is rendered mean- ingless because it cannot be interpreted as a metaphor for real expe- rience. Greenwood himself realised that this conclusion is counter- intuitive and sought to obviate the problem by suggesting that Euripides could have written an almost identical play purged of the traditional gods which would have been self-consistent and relevant to our experience30). The spectator then would have to posit this fictitious drama while watching the real one, an idea as cumber- some as it is ludicrous. But this notion of another play can be con- verted into a symbolic theory in terms of which we do not imagine the gods replaced by correlative non-divine powers in another, phantom play; instead we understand them symbolically in this one. 8. This brings us to category 8a: those who play down or blur the disruptive effects of 1340-46 but understand the gods as symbols in some degree. Kitto, for example, interprets the verses as relevant in their context, in that they reveal Heracles' "moral instinct", untest- ed by intelligence, about the gods31). This instinct is, in Kitto's view, correct, but the conclusion that Hera is no divinity is "kept out of 29) Greenwood (?. 12), 63 f. 30) Greenwood (?. 12), 10: "the story he [Euripides] gives us is so similar to another story, a story he does not give us, that the human significance of the story he does give us would hardly have been affected if he had actually given us the other". 31) H.D.F. Kitto, Greek Tragedy (London 1961), 247.</page><page sequence="10">138 S.E. LAWRENCE the play", and the goddess remains "dramatically real". Heracles can only be correct outside of the play (where by definition he him- self is non-existent!), but his insight allows the audience, though pre- sumably not the characters, to construct a symbolic interpretation of the gods based on the depiction of their relationship within the drama. "If the co-paternity of Zeus is dramatically real, the hatred of Hera is mythologically inevitable. Heracles is of more than mortal birth, as also he is of more than ordinary genius and achievement. The genius derives dramatically from Zeus; it follows almost automatically that Hera must wish to destroy it.... when the labours are finished his 'destiny' ceases to protect him and Nature destroys what she has pro- duced and used." For Lesky, "Hera and her messenger do not embody the powers of a higher order that were vital to the poet himself. Tradition pro- vides him with the means to objectify psychological experiences, but this tradition has become doubtful even worthless to him"32). Lucas suggests that Hera is the "factor which delays and obstructs the ful- filment of the good" and that Zeus' "right to restrain Hera is con- ditional"33). But it is unnecessary, with Kitto and Lucas, to derive a detailed symbolism from the relationships between the gods as depicted by Iris. The theology of their relations is relevant only to these literal gods. These critics differ from Halleran and Vickers in applying the extradramatic insight (the absurdity of the traditional gods) to the action itself in the form of symbolic reinterpretation. We come now to the view (8b) that attempts a full integration of the contradiction between Heracles' god and the gods of the play. This is the most difficult position to articulate clearly and in such a way as not to make it seem implausible by its very complexity. Now in the real world the contradition with which we are faced here would be nonsensical, but the world of a fiction is ontologically more flexible. Arrowsmith speaks of "an utter transformation of assumed reality. The whole play exhibits, as though on two pla- teaus, a conversion of reality. A story or legend derived from received 32) A. Lesky, Greek Tragedy (tr. Frankfort) (London 1964), 163. 33) D.W. Lucas, The Greek Tragic Poets (Cambridge 1959), 220.</page><page sequence="11">THE GOD AND THE UNIVERSE OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES 139 beliefs ... is suddenly in all its parts, terms, characters, and the val- ues it invokes converted under dramatic pressure to another phase of reality"34). In consequence, "the Heracles does two things with Hera: it first dramatizes the legend which contains her action as incredi- ble in a goddess, and then, having shown and asserted its incredi- bility, it converts her into a hovering symbol of ail the unknown and unknowable forces which compel Heracles and men to suffer trag- ically and without cause or sense"35). The use of the terms "reality" and especially "phase of reality" is confusing here. I would prefer to say that Euripides begins his play by positing as a metaphor for experience the conventional dramat- ic world of Greek tragedy with its traditional gods. At 1340-46 he signals to us that this metaphor or dramatic world is now inade- quate and to be replaced by another dramatic world generated from Heracles' radical theology. This new metaphor might (but need not) be applied, as it were, retroactively. Up to 1340-46 we are content (if only by suspension of disbelief) with the literal reality of the Olympians, though we have come to see them as unjust in their treatment of the hero. But Heracles now goes further. He denies these gods. Naturally as spectators we are not now required to retrace our steps laboriously back through the preceding action, substituting the new dramatic metaphor for the old by meticulous translation of all divine causation. This would be tantamount to writing Greenwood's alternative play, the one Euripides could have written but did not36). We simply intuit the deeper meaning behind the dramaturgical devices, which is what the gods (and everything else in the play) in the last analysis are. What was previously our sense of Hera's injustice is now felt less specifically as powerlessness in the face of a mysterious, impersonal and possibly random uni- verse37). 34) W. Arrowsmith, in: D.

LAWRENCE I remarked that it was possible but not necessary to apply the new metaphor retroactively. Indeed I would say that it would be prefer- able not to do this. Hera and the traditional universe are powerful cultural symbols which function to create a tremendous dramatic impact. The epiphany of Iris and Lyssa is especially effective in pro- ducing shock and moral indignation. At that point in the play the traditional religious world is exactly what is required. In any case the Heracles myth is inconceivable without it. Not only does Hera's hostility appropriately direct our (and Heracles') indignation against a personal target, but Zeus's paternity highlights in the most pow- erful way a sense of cosmic ingratitude and betrayal, feelings that we and the hero of the play experience until we learn (when it is time for us to learn it) that the universe is quite impersonal. Similarly, the supernatural labours and the semidivine status of the hero focus for us the sense of the greatest conceivable, and seem- ingly invulnerable human being. An important message of the play is that Heracles is after all only a man. The implied demythologis- ing of the universe at 1340-46 goes hand in hand with Heracles' dissociation of himself from Zeus and thereby from his own semi- divinity. The spectator's adjustment here from moral indignation to a sense of its irrelevance reflects a certain dichotomy in Greek deities themselves, for these personal gods were also in some cases imper- sonal forces. The dichotomy applies in Euripides' plays most strik- ingly to Aphrodite in Hippolytus and Dionysus in Bacchae. In so far as these deities have a conscious purpose and motivation our response to their activity is moral, but in so far as Aphrodite is iden- tified with the sexual instinct and Dionysus with natura naturans a response of moral indignation is beside the point; and in each of these plays Euripides encourages us to respond to the deity in both ways, as personal divinity and impersonal power. Hera, on the other hand, is not an obvious symbol, and the idea of Tyche that, loosely speaking, replaces her does not reflect simply her activity (the instigation of madness) shorn of hostile and personal motiva- tion. At first glance the Athena of the Troades might seem a better can- didate for a symbol of t???. In the prologue of that play Poseidon accuses her of capriciousness in abandoning the Greeks for the</page><page sequence="13">THE GOD AND THE UNIVERSE OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES 141 Trojans (67-8), and Hecuba's vision of the world much later in the play seems to echo this passage (1202-6). However, Athena rebuts the charge of caprice, explaining her about-face by the most readi- ly intelligible divine motive for hostile action against a mortal: the Greeks have dishonoured her by failing to punish Ajax for sacrilege (69-73). Moreover, Athena's initiative will come into effect only after the events on stage. On the surface then the HeracUs contradicts itself, or at least the dramatic counters contradict one another, but below this level on the plane of what these counters mean there is no contradiction. Stated thus, this view does, I believe, allow the lines their full reso- nance within the play while dealing satisfactorily with the contra- diction. It is important to stress that the spectator's penetration beneath the dramaturgical signifiers is intuitive. Any suggestion of laborious translation or decoding of all material involving the traditional gods flies in the face of commonsense about the possible or indeed desir- able emotional and intellectual responses of an audience. It is the business of interpreters to explain how the contradictions can be resolved, but such explanations are not rehearsals of the putative mental processes of hypothetical (let alone actual) spectators. In order to show that the intuitive adjustment imputed to the spectators at 1340-46 is plausible, I shall now attempt to trace their progressive responses in more detail and demonstrate thereby the organic nature of 1340-46, that is the relevance of the passage to Heracles' reorientation to the world. I have argued that after 1340-46 we sense that Zeus and Hera are merely dramaturgical counters or indicators that point to an underlying reality, but the play requires throughout constant adjust- ments by the audience to what they conceive its world-view to be. The quantum leap at 1340-46 is only the final and most sensation- al of these adjustments. At the outset, in the suppliant action, the play is set in the rather vaguely defined but familiar universe of Greek tragedy, a world of gods and heroes. But there is "litde or no sense of the divine"38), and Amphitryon calls Zeus into question in respect of his f???a, morality and power (339-46).

In any case the issues are raised and placed in a context of general moral unsatisfactoriness, for the evil (one's enemies) are prospering while the good (one's friends/rela- tives) are weak through gender, youth or old age40). In the second stasimon, after Heracles' return, the chorus, with naive idealism, complain that the gods' conception of justice is awry by our stan- dards because good people get old and die (655-72). Furthermore, while the existence, though not the justice of the traditional gods is taken for granted, much greater emphasis is placed on forces or principles such as fortune, necessity and time, notions perfectly compatible with the Olympian gods but attributed so much promi- nence here that they seem to have all but usurped the functions of those gods41). Nominally then there is the traditional world of Greek tragedy, but in effect?as an audience would sense?it is a world in which the gods are all but superfluous. At this point there is no con- tradiction. The traditional mythic world-view provides an adequate, if not entirely appropriate metaphor of the way things are in the play. Now, with the arrival of Heracles and the dispatch of Lycus, Zeus is apparendy vindicated; and, if an audience has the time and the inclination to reflect on Amphitryon's emphasis on t??? and his criticisms of Zeus, they will conclude that he was in error. In any event, at this point they will have adjusted themselves comfortably back into the traditional world of myth, laying aside the misgivings of the previous scene, misgivings that threatened but did not destroy that traditional world. With the epiphany of Iris and Lyssa the question of divine justice is reopened with increased urgency as the gods (apart from Lyssa) are clearly shown to be unjust. The audience are rudely returned to Amphitryon's view of Zeus but not to his emphasis on t???. (That will come later.) There is nothing random about Hera's as- sault on Heracles.

A goddess may be expected to harm an enemy, as would any decent Greek with the power to do so; and even if such a specta- tor were persuaded of Hera's injustice on the higher consideration of Heracles' services to gods and mortals, he or she would know that the gods are sometimes unjust and that there was no point in requiring them to be otherwise. On the other hand, any one in the audience inclined to associate deity with justice would already be unhappy with the Olympians and would be accepting them now in the theatre only by suspension of disbelief. The play at this point, at any rate, depicts these gods as real and powerful, but unjust. That they are unjust is undeniable in the light of Iris' failure to offer a reasoned rebuttal of Lyssa's objections (846-57) and Zeus's failure to frustrate Hera's initiative (827-32) is left morally and even mytho- logically undefended42). Even a spectator previously content with unjust Olympians is required here to question their morality or at least be stirred to uneasiness through indignation at the hero's fate. When Heracles wakes from his post-manic sleep he begins to come to terms with his predicament. His sense of Hera's injustice (1303 ff.) accords with the spectator's own indignation, and his con- demnation of his tormentress comes to a head with the question: 'Who would pray to such a goddess?' (1307-8). The implications of this are more radical than they appear at first sight to a modern reader. To anyone who thinks that God is morally perfect it is quite uncontroversial to suggest that an unjust god is not worthy to receive our prayers. But this is not a traditional Greek view. Cer- tainly the ancients were capable of religious adoration (though indi- viduals like Euripides' Hippolytus were doubdess exceptional), but the prerequisite for praying to a god was simply the god's divinity with that term's implication of overwhelming power. When Hera- cles virtually advocates excommunicating Hera, he is effectively (though not necessarily intentionally) rending the fabric of Greek religious observance, always a thing of more social and political importance than mere theological heresies43). Heracles' position 42) Contrast Artemis' explanations for her own and Poseidon's non-interven- tion in Hippolytus' behalf (Hipp. 1318-30). 43) According to Guthrie (n. 13), 227, "There is plenty of evidence that the hold of religion over men's minds was weakening in the intellectual ferment of the Periclean age, and also that Athenian officialdom was nervous and touchy about</page><page sequence="16">144 S.E. LAWRENCE here, posing as it does an implied threat to ignore Hera's cult, is at least as subversive as his remarks at 1340-46, by which point he has struck out at both religious observance and religious belief. Once the audience reach this point (i.e. at 1346) Heracles has in effect denied much of his own myth; but, since that myth is finally only a metaphor, it is only a metaphor that destroys itself here. These traditional data are merely the means by which the dramatist embodies his conception of a supremely capable and moral human being. But why should Euripides adopt such a seemingly complicated strategy rather than giving us a single seamless metaphor of reality as he saw it? It is too negative to say merely that tradition com- pelled him to work with the myths with their built-in world-view. He could have left Zeus and Hera out of the play, given no expla- nation of Heracles' madness, and played down the supernatural aspects of the labours. The gods might have been a matter for dis- cussion but their reality left uncertain. However, apart from giving us Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark, Euripides would have conveyed his meaning much less incisively. It was better to appear to confirm the traditional world-view only to destroy it, to take us on a similar theological Odyssey to that of the characters. Once Heracles rejects Hera's morality and, by implication at least, her existence, he thinks of his predicament in purely secular terms, notwithstanding his subsequent reference to Hera's t??? (1393). But if Hera and the gods are rejected as inadequate metaphors, how do we explain the events of the play in such a way as to preserve a significant causal sequence? We saw how in the suppliant action Amphitryon and Megara evinced more confidence in t???, Necessity or Time than in the benevolent concern of Zeus. With Heracles' return, however, Zeus seems vindicated?and even more so when Lycus is killed44). But the madness that follows imme- diately upon this good fortune makes nonsense of the idea of the god's benevolence. According to Iris, Zeus protected his son until the completion of the labours (827-9). She does not say that he it. The cult of the gods was integral to the life of the state and a powerful cohe- sive force". 44) w.773-80, 798-814 (note that the adultery is now celebrated and time has become, as it were, benign: contrast 506 f.).</page><page sequence="17">THE GOD AND THE UNIVERSE OF EURIPIDES' HERACLES 145 brought him home in time to save his family. Had he done so he would appear not so much indifferent as viciously ironical. We are not told how Heracles happened to return at such a significant junc- ture, and of course Theseus' arrival is similarly timely. Once the tra- ditional symbols are removed these events are left unexplained. The notion of t???, as remarked above, is quite compatible with the operation of the traditional gods or any form of purposeful uni- verse, since it does not necessarily entail that the world is quintes- sentially chaotic. There was no need to go so far. All that is required is a recognition on the part of Heracles and the audience that we have to survive as best we can in an unpredictable world that lacks the coherence of even a goddess' hostility. Heracles' new god, as we saw, is in no way reassuring45). He is Euripides' way of giving his hero a purely secular orientation without turning him into an athe- ist (if that term is appropriate in the Greek context). That Heracles' new orientation is indeed secular is best brought out by contrasting his reflections with those of Sophocles' Oedipus after the self-blinding. Oedipus, like Heracles, is aware of the god responsible for his predicament (OT 1327-35), but he never con- demns that god and, in the belief that nothing can ever kill him, he speaks of being saved for some great misfortune (1455-7). Such a view is based on faith in a pattern to events, though Oedipus cer- tainly never suggests that the pattern is benign, just or rational. He goes on then to accept whatever destiny may bring (1458). Sopho- cles' hero is emotionally shattered, but his experience has only con- firmed the traditional religion. Indeed, the idea of a random uni- verse which he briefly entertained with Jocasta's encouragement has been tragically invalidated (OT 977-9, 1080-5). Heracles, on the other hand, is principally concerned to cope with each unpredict- able and perhaps inexplicable t??? as it arises (1347-57). Theseus, of course, proposes turning him into a cult figure after his death (1331-3), but there is no intimation of a genuine apotheosis nor any enthusiasm for the proposal on the part of Heracles, who does not even refer to it in his lengthy reply to the rest of Theseus' speech. Otherwise the only aspect of his attitude that could be called reli- gious is his sense of his own pollution (especially at 1399) and its 45) See above, p. 135 f..</page><page sequence="18">146 S.E. LAWRENCE likely consequence of barring him from not only human contact, but the whole of the natural world (1281-98). But Theseus strongly discourages his anxiety on this score (1231-4, 1399 f.), though he advises his friend to act for the sake of ????? by leaving Thebes and cleansing his hands of blood guilt in Athens (1332-4). This emanci- pated attitude contrasts with Creon's towards Oedipus (OT 1424- 31) and is completely in accord with the generally anti-convention- al tenor of the final scene. For this reason our passage (1340-6) is no extradramatic embarrassment but a significant part of Heracles' reorientation. I must finally consider a possible objection. Am I not placing too much emphasis on a mere seven verses, and in particular two of those verses, as if an audience at that point were suddenly vouch- safed a revelation without which Euripides' meaning would be entirely missed? Of course it would be absurd to ask the passage to carry so much weight. But let us consider the consequences of ignoring it altogether. In that case the audience would be brought to see the injustice of Hera and her unworthiness to be revered as a goddess, but they would be left with her reality. The original world of the play would remain intact. None of this would obscure Heracles' secular orientation. The audience would simply be spared the invitation to make the leap from unjust god to no god?a leap that is indeed undertaken by a character in one of the extant frag- ments46). Without this leap, Euripides' meaning and the play's impact remain essentially undisturbed, for whether or not the gods are real, Heracles certainly will turn away from them for his human f????. The meaning of the drama then does not depend utterly on this passage, but it is certainly enriched by it, as Heracles' new sec- ularity is supported by a religious insight that forces upon at least the more intellectually capable members of the audience a theolog- ical challenge for which the play has in its own way carefully and progressively prepared them.
