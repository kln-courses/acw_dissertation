<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ten Contaminants: Unheimlich Trajectories of Architecture STANLEY TIGERMAN University of Illinois at Chicago Architectural embodiment perpetuates the myth that architecture brings human activity home. Architects and their constituents are just as nomadic now as they were when the redactor of the Bible referred to dwelling as tent and thus equated dwelling, being, i.e., existence, with eternally movable. The initiation of an architecture having fixed limits, i.e., presence, is first inscribed biblically in the ninth century B.C.E. with the construction of Solomon's Temple (see my Architecture of Exile, published by Rizzoli, 1988). Architecture is no more at home in building-as-presence than it is in the quintessence it dissimulates. A building's form of existence is as itinerant as its location on the planet Earth generally, or as failed as its contaminants degenerate it, specifically. The presumptions that imbue its presence signify humankind's determination to resist dwelling in nature naturally and to replace mobility with static images simulating an unrealizable permanence. Architecture's inability to define itself inherently brings forth its "unheimlich" condition every bit as much as when humankind, individually and collective ly, denies its own temporality. The conceit underpinning the presence of building leads to a false sign of endurance. Deconstruction appears to have coaxed architecture's uncanny nature out of its repressed state: it is uncertain at this time whether it can ever be 32</page><page sequence="2">THE TEN CONTAMINANTS 33 suppressed again. The only hope is that, once out, the initial shock of the unexpectedly disjunctive forms of this new architecture will, through reitera tion (the first signs of convention), become sufficiently familiar to suggest elaboration and embellishment. Thus impelled, architect and generalist alike may come to understand that architecture's undigested (and unsynthesized) constituencies only relieve those who practice the discipline from unnecessary and/or exaggerated obliga tions toward seeking closure through unnaturally forced acts of "resolution." The slippery way in which architects have traditionally repressed expressing the constituent parts of their craft without digesting (and synthesizing) its several parts may come to be seen to be just as horrifying as the way in which the field's uncanny counterpart is perceived currently. The problem, delimited by the presence of architecture, is one of embodi ment. The subtext of architecture's absent mythic state, once thought to be locked into its location in memory recorded by history, is disrupted and dislocated by dredging it up into a state of embodiment. The house of architecture is thus haunted through embodying its memory by endowing it with an artificial form out of time. In this way history is exploited as a rationale, though that claim is made only in the name of the perpetuation of architectural language. The evolution of that language, combined with the ostensibly natural desire to seek its roots both etymologically and actually, is presented as sufficient justification for this activity. Certain conditions exist which displace our understanding of architecture as being a series of "readable" forms that, through closure, attain compre hensibility. These conditions relate directly to the inability that architects have in overcoming their insistence that nothing resists positioning the field as an autonomous discipline. This insistence distorts the fact that while architecture is measured continuously by its endlessly significant "others," the building discipline is presented as being innocently free of contaminants, despite the fact that it is the contaminants that energize the field, giving architecture much of its vitality. The insistence that architecture is an autonomous discipline is relevant only if it exists independently of its con taminants; but before questions of sovereignty can be taken up, the reciproc ity between architecture and its contaminants is a subject insufficiently scrutinized until now. Now it is certain that architecture is both defined and conditioned by many significant others, among them: capital, religion, ethics, gender, in equality, the body, measure/finitude, and correspondence/technique of the Other. (These significant others were the subject of an unrealized symposia that John Whiteman, W.J. T. Mitchell, and I posited as a yearlong Uni versity of Chicago seminar, culminating in a special issue of Critical Inquiry on</page><page sequence="3">34 STANLEY TIGERMAN the subject of the crisis in architectural language.) There are ten contaminants particularly that I wish to focus upon here that trouble a discipline in search of itself. They are: 1. CONGESTION (the gathering of forces that help to locate and define eccentricities of building semiotically, i.e., the coding of appurtenances, apertures, and places of penetration generally); 2. DEATH (the continuous spread of congestion, leading inevitability to, and/or architecturally describing, the imminence of an absence that ultimately displaces presence); 3. DIMENSIONALITY (the inability of two or more physical elements to inhabit the same space at the same time); 4. GRAVITY (the irrefutability of downward motion, collapsing bodies, and buildings, not only locally but generally); 5. INDETERMINACY (the difficulties connected with resisting the desire to present architecture as being definitive); 6. MIMESIS (imitation, or [re]presentation); 7. NOSTALGIA (the insistence upon corroborating a rearview dependency upon precedent, combined with an irresistible desire to intersect with origins [divine or secular]); 8. OTHERNESS (architecture's insistence upon being defined by any thing other than its own quintessence); 9. STASIS (a stable state characterized by the cancellation of all forces by equal and opposing forces); and 10. SYNTHESIS (the assembling of primary or subordinate parts into new, and presumably unexpected, forms). These ten contaminants help to define architecture's resistance to present ing itself in ways that defy our perception of it as either a social, or as an artful, expression. Taken separately, the study of these contaminants will help to illuminate the density layered upon "the mother of the arts" and in so doing edify its unheimlich state. The First Contaminant: Congestion The use of congestion as an architectural strategy denoting penetration, fenestration, and other disjunctions of its surface, i.e., its presence, is acti vated by employing the tactic of "coding" the elements of building so as to make a particular architecture "accessible." The use of a code provides an opportunity to convey the nature, even the predominance, of certain parts of a building that are distinct from other parts. A code can also explicate the transformation of both general as well as local site information, relocating it onto the face of the building in an attempt to "ground" (or graft) a project onto a site larger than the actual one that it inhabits. One possible result of congestion is closure, or death. As in the case of congestive heart failure, architectural congestion, even as it is utilized to semiotically convey, for example, entrance into a building, when carried to extremes can result in closing (or collapsing) the very opening which it signifies initially as being accessible. Architects eschew this problem by</page><page sequence="4">THE TEN CONTAMINANTS 35 relying upon their unique ability to exploit "aura" (the result of a process leading to aesthetically arbitrary judgement, sometimes referred to as con noisseurship). The operative view about architectural congestion, or excessive accumulation—or overcrowding—is that it is to be avoided at all costs. Indeed, there has always been a luster attached to simplicity. The expression of excess has not found a happy home in architecture, yet the distribution and organization of excess is understood programmatically as a conventional architectural task to be dealt with. (Louis Sullivan's utterance "form follows function" could have easily been transposed to read "form follows the orderly distribution of human needs, of which excess is a significant factor.") Excess can be viewed as being without roots or homeless (unheimlick) at least in the context of a fixed architecture that is situated in a particular place. Excess contaminates fixed things by deforming them into unexpected ly unpredictable, but always undesirable, shapes (possibly because they cannot be anticipated), a condition that is unwelcome in the house of architecture. Thus congestion is something to be organized and simplified, not accepted as it stands. It is NOT a strategy for design—it is a contaminant. The Second Contaminant: Death The most provocative of all the ten contaminants is death itself. The excru ciating pull toward the absence of presence is the particular preoccupation here. Normally, aspirational qualities connected with life after death find concomitance with that status of architecture whose expectation is to be "judged by all the ages." It is rare that architecture is employed to haunt its very denotational condition; and yet the very materials that delimit architecture are by definition unmoving (because they themselves are dead), since the prerequisite of statics insists upon unmovability. Built for the living, valorized by "all the ages," architecture leaps over death as if it were not there precisely because it is the most tainted of all contaminants: it is death after all that robs architecture of both its life as well as its life after death. The invulnerability often associated with an architecture of fixity comes from a conscious avoidance of the vulnerability associated with temporality. It is the biblical tent that is anything but stationary that most closely resembles temporality, architecturally speaking; and it is the tent that is more vulnerable precisely because it is NOT stationary. To live with the imminence of death is the destiny of humanity, but it is not the destiny of the stationary architecture that houses humanity immutably: that subject's goal is to be measured throughout all the ages, and the conceit that posits that desire is only possible by absenting the absence of death.</page><page sequence="5">36 STANLEY TIGERMAN The same faith which conditions attitudes about life after death is the presumption that is superimposed artificially on a fixed architecture mea sured by all the ages. History does not interpret after all; it records. Inter pretation indeterminately informs theory, while faith delimits history; and the opposite is also true: interpretation undermines history, while faith undermines interpretation. It is no wonder that Western architecture is rooted in Greco-Christian histo-theology. The transcendence of death into an afterlife is thought to reinvigorate humanity (or at least make life palatable) as well as architecture; death, after all, is a terminal contaminant. The Third Contaminant: Dimensionality The particular problem whereby dimensionality aggravates architecture consists in the way in which it defies the simultaneous appearance of separate and/or different elements in the same location at the same time. Nonetheless, architectural production persistently presents the elements of its situation (columns, beams, etc.) as if they were in the same plane, even if literal structure (and construction) has to be displaced perceptually by something other than itself in order to overcome the difficult reality of the elements that support each other failing to exist simultaneously. What is not generally understood is that when architecture fails to convene two or more elements in the same place at the same time, it engages in acts of eccentric loading; i.e., it engages in acts that complicate embodiment within the discipline that grav ity enforces (see the fourth contaminant). Therefore, problems of architectural embodiment are problems complicated by eccentric loading, or if you like, eccentricity; i.e., the problem is one of stabilizing an architecture in danger of toppling over. The problem becomes one of "restraint." All this comes from the inability to situate more than one element in one place at one time. Therefore, simultaneity problematizes an architecture whose components as well as whose totality are situated in one place at one time. This kind of architecture can be referred to as unitarian: one unit, one place, one time (and, through faith, all time). Thus dimensionality is a contaminant of the worst kind—it challenges the unitary condition of the object by subjecting it to substitution (the substitu tion of one element for another by displacing the former in the location in which it exists by the latter). Architecture's presence delimited by dimen sionality is overturned when dimensionality's existence can only be delimited by resisting simultaneity, the very element that challenges architecture as a fixed situation located in a particular place.</page><page sequence="6">THE TEN CONTAMINANTS 37 The Fourth Contaminant: Gravity The incessant pull of gravity, though seemingly inescapable (particularly in the shrinkage of bodies sited perpendicularly to what passes for the earth's horizontal surface), continues to problematize architecture. Regardless of their resistance to gravity, the most flexible elements of both tectonic and anthropomorphic bodies are the ones most subject to shrinkage over time, thus changing their characteristics through compression compounded by movement of any kind (vibration, oscillation, etc.). This shrinkage remains generally unacknowledged in both holistic as well as detail aspects of architecture. If compression were expanded upon continuously, the results would be unthinkable—a kind of uninhabitable, flattened architecture leading to its own disappearance. But that is precisely what happens to buildings as well as bodies impacted upon by gravity over varying degrees of time until all that remains are tectonic as well as anthropomorphic skeletons. Architects normally dissemble problems delimited by gravity, avoiding yet another level of complexity (and/or meaning, depending on your view). In the insistence upon closure, continuous, albeit locally miniscule, downward motion is viewed, not as something requiring expression, but rather as something to be avoided, if not suppressed outright. Therefore, gravity is a contaminant, not a strategy for design. The Fifth Contaminant: Indeterminacy Architecture's project is nothing if not determinate. The fact of its presence, combined with the single understanding of that presence as representative of a fixed, unchanging image, regardless of individual interpretation, has di minished whatever potentiality architecture has to incorporate, indeed to embrace, change. Its immutability, so resistive to change, shifts the burden of interpretation away from itself to that of the spectator/user/interpreter. In this, architecture is curiously post-structural in its (un)intentionality if not in its literal self, since the notion of indeterminacy is easier to posit than to actuate in the architectural sense of presentness. Deconstruction's project, architecturally speaking, is to give form to the unimaginable—in this case, to the indeterminate. It is a project that quite possibly is unrealizable, but dialectically it remains a contaminant nonethe less, for every time determinacy is invoked in the name of architecture, its counterpart is inferred.</page><page sequence="7">38 STANLEY TIGERMAN The Sixth Contaminant: Mimesis Mimesis in architecture is brought about by a disillusionment with the present. This disillusionment is caused by an exaggerated belief in the validation that comes about by (reiterative exercises in the use of precedent. Normally exploited by an epoch that is insecure about its collective self, the condition was first apparent in Europe during the Renaissance. Chaucer, Spencer, and Shakespeare are among the many writers that helped to define this malaise from a literary vantage point (see A. Bartlett Giammati's Exile and Change in Renaissance Literature)·, but it is the architects of the day who most poignantly expressed the sense of loss permeating the times. By first remov ing the theocentric "center" so common to architecture predating that period, only to subsequently reinhabit that center by positioning man into what was originally a space occupied only by a divine being, the architects of the Renaissance concretized feelings of collective insecurity about a present that for them was stunningly absent. The anthropocentric rationalization that followed was thought to challenge humankind's mimetic relationship to the divine being. By mimetically committing themselves to reiterative operations attached to Greco-Roman precedent, the architects of the Renaissance attempted to validate their epoch by exploiting history even as they inadvertently invali dated their era as providing any source of intrinsic inspiration when de tached from historic corroboration. Succumbing to the sadness resulting from overwhelming nostalgic desires to intersect with a divine being, the architects of the day engaged in (r€)iterative projects in order to substantiate an age detached from itself (see the seventh contaminant). The problem with mimesis is that once the commitment to a position of perpetual imperfection is undertaken, the mime is guaranteed the rewards of imperfection: the faults, flaws, and defects connected with playing that role. The copy contaminates the original into a state of hopeless irretrievability. The Seventh Contaminant: Nostalgia Nostalgia, as it is presented in this context, is shown to be the single most debilitating source that keeps architecture within itself traditionally and resultantly deflected away from whatever trajectory that might reflect a potentiality for change. The perpetual search for precedent and analogy at once inhibits, even as it verifies, architecture. The resulting legitimation keeps architecture "in its place" like little else. The opportunities for displac ing nostalgia, precisely in the way that nostalgia displaces architecture toward its significant "other" rooted in the picturesqueness of originary yearnings, are opportunities for overturning nostalgia on itself and replacing</page><page sequence="8">THE TEN CONTAMINANTS 39 it with the invigoration of a present in search of its own intrinsic self. Nostalgia breeds a sadness stemming from the yearning to return. The optimism firmly embodied in an architecture believing itself as presenting a moral imperative (a force for change rather than a force for (re)presenting a status quo) is lost in much the same way as nostalgia itself characterizes loss. Sadness is the inevitable result of a contamination so virulent that no antidote is capable of redeeming that optimistic spirit that comes about as a result of a collision with what is new and unknown. The comfort connected with familiar forms emanating from a nostalgic view of things creates an overwhelming desire to reconnect with origins and is too much to resist. Melancholy results. It is the melancholy of the unhealable wound stemming from a contaminant that debilitates the body of architecture. The Eighth Contaminant: Otherness Architects traditionally define their craft as something other than what it is at its essential core. Through approach avoidance, architects look for defini tion elsewhere than in the home that is architecture's own house. Function, structure, need, use, referentiality, and in turn, deferentiality, are among those characteristics that continuously defer the need to look inward into architecture's own precinct, so to speak, for understanding what, if anything, constitutes its essence—its autonomy. Among the many extrinsic forces that seduce architects away from their craft, two—metaphor and metonymy—stand out as more dominant than others. Metaphor, i.e., where one object is likened to another, has been an architectural referent throughout the history of Western architecture. Metonymy, i.e., consisting in the naming of a thing by one of its attributes, has been another architectural referent by which forms are deflected away from the expression of their own essence. Beyond metaphor and metonymy, other diversions distract architects away from probing at the essence of their craft. Functionalism, formalism, structural expressionism, and regionalism are but a few of the many distrac tions that dull the attention that architects might otherwise have so as to define their discipline from within. This need to search for an "other," i.e., that which is extrinsic to architecture's innate substance, defers perpetually the potential to illuminate what otherwise might be intrinsic to that sub stance. In order to resist the temptations to defer defining architecture from within, it is necessary to conceive of it as being removed from all of those elements that deflect that search away from itself. Such an architecture of resistance is difficult to conceive when it is stripped of all of the conventions that have traditionally defined it. It is not unreasonable to do away with</page><page sequence="9">40 STANLEY TIGERMAN metaphor which traditionally prohibits an understanding of the nature of material by burdening it with images that have nothing to do with it. It is also not unreasonable to resist the conventional condition that architects have traditionally subjected their production to, i.e., the condition of being "secondary" rather than "primary." Plato's charge that "art is in the shad ow of truth" is perpetuated in the mother of the arts when architects distance themselves from their craft by engaging in acts of "otherness," reinforcing that philosopher's precept that art (architecture) is a secondary, not a primary, activity. The Ninth Contaminant: Stasis The myth that architecture is static is reinforced by our perception that buildings do not seem to move. Of course we know that gravity impercep tibly causes bodies as well as buildings to compress as they fail utterly to resist downward forces. What is not immediately understood about the myth of stasis is the immense energy required to resist ceaselessly the natural desire for architecture's constituent elements (columns, beams, trusses, gird ers, and walls) to become dynamic in their inevitable departure one from the other. The conventional ways in which these constituent elements are assembled defy natural forces (gravity, lateral forces, etc.) to cause those elements to dissemble. It is only by taking the most extraordinary measures that the benign appearance that buildings convey is at all even possible. An example of equal and opposite forces appearing as static is represented by the conventional force diagram that resists gravity by thrusting it into equilib rium through the introduction of structural elements that by their very name (compression members) indicate the direction that they will ultimately, albeit slowly, move. The characterization that opposing forces cancel each other out speaks to the interdependency delimiting architecture such that, in certain circum stances, projects evolve precisely on the basis of internalizing their own stabilizing condition. Another way of describing the balancing of opposing forces is countervalance, in which the potential for deterioration is implicit in the particularities of juxtaposition. Actually, architecture is always in the process of being destabilized, even as it presumes neutrality in such things. But destabilization is not a characteristic that is easily accepted: certainly not within the context of that overwhelming cultural force—history—that causes architecture to sustain itself through its own validation. Despite the physical law that posits that a body at rest wants to stay at rest, problems of stasis represent a particular architectural problem whose resolution requires immense energy to create the perception implied by the subject. Stability, in a word, is not always that which is perceived. On the</page><page sequence="10">THE TEN CONTAMINANTS 41 other hand, deterioration (degradation), or the collapse of apparently per petually static essences causing them to "flow" or to change velocity or in any case to change their appearance, represents the kinetic counterpart always implicit in stasis. The development of an architecture that resists the constancy normal to the composition of counterpoised physical elements represents the challenge inferred by stasis. Such an architecture is subversive to precedent and as such is a clandestine operation abnormal to technique inscribed by evolution valorized by history. The Tenth Contaminant: Synthesis The last problem I wish to focus upon is that of synthesis, i.e., the assembling of separate or subordinate parts into a new form, i.e., the complex whole resulting from its parts. The tradition of architecture is, in part, based on its determined search for closure. Closure, in architectural terms, is perceived as the inevitable result of consummating often disparate forces into a newly arrived-at form which of itself presumably results from the amalgam of those disparate forces. There is a certain implication of equivalency in such think ing, but in architecture, as in Hegelian philosophy, nothing could be further from the truth. Synthesis comes about through the subordination of one or more of the constituent parts that are themselves being digested, or synthesized, in favor of that specific, overriding particularity that will ultimately dominate the whole. It is seldom that a building evolves that presents an equivalency repre senting fairly all of the elements that go into its formulation. The problem of privileging one element over another in the continuous quest for closure is endemic to synthetic thought. In other words, oppositional dialectical theories are seldom so equivalent in their orientation that stability or equilibrium between oppositional essences is maintained. The resistance to privileging one element over another is a constant irritant to the architect disposed to synthetic thought. The difficulty of producing an architecture that does not privilege one element over another remains one of the greatest challenges facing architecture. Unresolved dialectical thought is one strategy available to architects who feel determined to resist the pressure to synthesize their production. The problem with this strategy is that it goes against the grain of the optimistic spirit that has always conditioned architecture from a humanistic viewpoint. At the sacrifice of this humanistic tradition, the value of using unresolved dialectical thinking is reasonable, if only from a short-term point of view, since it opens up possibilities not always available in the synthetic province.</page><page sequence="11">42 STANLEY TIGERMAN (in)Conclusive Conclusion The study of these contaminants has increasingly occupied my mind (as well as my architectural production) in recent years. These studies grow out of an increasing dissatisfaction with architecture as a secondary, rather than as a primary, pursuit. While I have no conclusive proof that architecture has constituent features that could identify it as being primary, my suspicions are that this is the case; and my goal through this work is to ascertain whether these suspicions are grounded in fact. The burden of history weighing down a particular discipline such as architecture with the continuous need for (re) validation enervates this physi cal trace of culture. It is useful to identify problems that (dt)limit this human activity so as to reconstitute it in a primary as well as a secondary way, since it is generally acknowledged today that architecture (and many other disci plines as well) is a multivalent activity. Contamination of bodies and buildings, hybridizing them from their pure state, opens up new ways of scrutinizing a discipline like architecture that has retained distance from its epoch, presumably for the purpose of idealiz ing the real. But ideality no longer utterly dominates ideas, and the hydrid as well as the pure flower can exist in tandem. Seeking a better way may not be as mutually exclusive from "reflecting the will of an epoch" as once thought. The nomad and the ostensibly permanent dweller may yet have much to learn from their significant other.</page></plain_text>
