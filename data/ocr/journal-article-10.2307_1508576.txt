<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE H. J. ROSE UNIVERSITY OF ST. ANDREWS, SCOTLAND HERODOTOS (ii, 52) gives us the following theory, which I quote in the charming translation of Mr. J. E. Powell: And formerly the Pelasgians in all their sacrifices prayed unto The Gods. . . . but they gave none of them any name or surname; for they had not yet heard thereof. . . . But when a long time afterwards they learned from Egypt the names of all the gods except Dionysus, whose name they learned much later, they consulted the oracle at Dodona con- cerning the names. . . . And when the Pelasgians consulted the oracle at Dodona, asking if they should receive the names which came from the barbarians, the oracle answered that they should use them. And so from that time forward, when they sacrificed, they used the names of the gods. And the Greeks received them afterwards from the Pelasgians. MODERN philology of course forbids us to accept the suggestion that the divine names in use among the classical and pre-classical Greeks were of Egyptian origin, although I remember a Greek attendant at the National Museum in Athens still stoutly main- taining that Athene was simply Neith written backwards. But modern philology in its latest pronouncements does little to re- place the Herodotean theory with another and more convincing set of etymologies. That Zeus is the same as Iup(piter) and Dyaus is indeed a universally accepted result of earlier researches. Hades seems also to be a good Greek name, whether we are con- tent with the older suggestion that he is the Unseen One, 'AFCI8, or hold that he is god of the earth, ala, as some would have it. But here the list of anything like certainties appears to end, so far at all events as the principal figures of cult and mythology are con- cerned. Athene is certainly not Greek in origin; if the name of Hera is really the feminine of ijpog, that is a title, "Lady," and no proper name. To connect Artemis or Artamis with ipracpog is plausible but not very satisfactory, for she is a huntress, not a butcher nor a butcher's assistant. Demeter's name ends in a good</page><page sequence="2">4 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Greek title, and she is past doubt a mother, but her first syllable is a stumbling-block, and some are fain to connect it with a hypo- thetical name Da, attached to a rather dubious pre-Hellenic earth- goddess, who is also pressed into service to explain the third syllable of the name of Poseidon (Poseidaon, Poteidan). If this is right, neither deity can claim to be purely Greek, but must be rated as the half-breed offspring of Hellenic and non-Hellenic cult-names. Kronos is certainly not Greek in name, Apollo is by every test a foreigner, characteristic Greek though he became and uncertain though his ultimate origin may be. The hold of Hermes upon stone-heaps or rubble, Cp/ta, is I believe somewhat loosened by the latest investigations. That Ares is a foreigner from Thrace is asserted time and again by the ancients, who quite probably knew what they were talking about. The Protean name of Perseph- one is assuredly not Greek, and that her other self (through a false identification of early date) is called plain Kore is true but not in point; when was anyone, human or divine, Greek or bar- barian, named simply Girl? In one language or another that may be an affectionate nickname, like that of the heroine of The Maker of Heavenly Trousers, or a contemptuous title given to a boy who does not satisfy his fellows' standards of manliness; but a proper name it is not and never was. The Corn-Maiden simply has no name that we know of. Nor for that matter has the hearth goddess, for she and her fire share the same name, Hestia, whether that has anything to do with the Latin Vesta or not. If, as is generally held, the name of Dionysos was learned much later, still it was learned from a people to whom the syllable nys meant something, as it apparently never did in Greek. And this does not take into account the long list of deities whose names no modern ever tried to make out to be Greek, or whose Greek etymologies have broken down hopelessly (as in the case of that manifest Asian, Aphro- dite), or of whom we know no names but only titles, or who show in their formation that they come from the pre-Hellenic popula- tion, as Hyakinthos, or who have faded into heroes and heroines, with perhaps a pun by way of etymology, like Helen. The minor figures of cult make a somewhat better showing. Pan yields a respectably Wiro etymology, the Nymphs and the various classes of Nymphs have Greek titles, and the Nereids at</page><page sequence="3">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 5 least have a Greek suffix, though the Tritons show the non-Greek syllable tri-, which apparently has something to do with water. But, and this may be a point of some significance, these are nearly all class-names (even Pan has a plural, although not early nor commonly attested).' Apart from such persons as river-gods, we seldom find one of the plebs superum with an individual appella- tion of his or her own, except in myths, where now and then a Nymph, for instance, has a personal name. We are thus faced with the fact that the earliest Greeks of whom we can hear or at whose language and customs we can intelligently guess were in much the same state as Herodotos' Pelasgians with regard to most of the objects of their worship. In their heaven was, we may safely enough assume, Zeus with his control of the weather, and at his side perhaps the shadowy Dione who con- tinued to be his consort at Dodona. Beneath the earth were, at least at certain seasons of the year, Kore, presumably Pluton, not yet confused with Hades, and probably not yet accompanied by his rather featureless doublet Plutos or the rarely mentioned Plut6 who was the mother of Tantalos, and conceivably, if a Greek derivation can be found for her, by Demeter, or failing her by some equivalent goddess. On earth there was hardly anyone whom we can name, save that a river would be credited with the presence of a god named from it, an Inachos or an Acheloos, or whatever streams were familiar at that early date, or a mountain haunted by a similar being, an Olympos perhaps or a Kyllene. What, then, are we to think of the earliest Greek pantheon? Several solutions appear possible and worthy of consideration. One is, that the various communities into which Greeks of every age that we know about tend to split were more or less henotheis- tic, or at any rate worshipped very few deities. If this was so, there would be little need of names for them; they could be simply "the god" or "the goddess," some laudatory title being perhaps 1 The earliest certain instance of the Panes is Ar.,Eccl.Io69. The supposed oc- currences of the plural in Aeschylus and Sophokles rest on the evidence of scholia which strike me as not only uncertain in text but muddled and suspect in contents, see the notes respectively of Nauck (ed. 2) and Jebb-Pearson on Aesch.fgt.35 and Soph.fgt.136. Especially do I doubt the statement of schol.ps.-Eur., Rhes.36 that Aesch. distinguished two Pans, one the son of Kronos and one of Zeus. In itself the plurality is perfectly credible. Cf. Nilsson, GgR i2, p. 236.</page><page sequence="4">6 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW added. A certain amount of evidence for this is forthcoming. We have only to consult Pausanias to find a number of small local cults addressed to beings of whom, apart from pious speculations by the periegete himself, nothing seems to have been known. A glance at the index to the Teubner edition furnishes a dozen or more examples. Passing to more important worships, it is well known that various states tended to emphasize the importance of some one deity or of a very few above the rest. Thus at Pylos, as the Linear B tablets show us, Poseidon held a leading position from fairly early Mycenaean times, while at Athens he almost rivalled Athena and the two of them quite dwarfed Zeus, to judge from the ecclesiastical calendar of the state. At Eleusis, again, Demeter and her daughter were outstandingly the main objects of cult. The earliest Dorian remains at Sparta show something very like a predominance of Ortheia. And as for the common adoption of new gods from various sources, we have a parallel in the religious history of the pre-exilic Hebrews, who manifestly tended, despite the efforts of the more zealous worshippers of Yahweh, to supplement his cult with that of sundry local Ba'alim and other importations and borrowings from near neighbors or the earlier inhabitants of the land. Certainly even our admittedly imperfect documentation is rich enough to show us an increasing number of objects of official worship, to say nothing of those pri- vately introduced in sundry thiasoi and apparently tolerated by the State; and what certainly took place in fully historical times may have taken place also in pre- or protohistoric epochs. But if anything at all resembling this supposed henotheism ever did ex- ist, it must have been at an irrecoverably early date, for every- thing we definitely know about the cults of any Greeks whatsoever shows them worshipping a quite considerable number of deities, small and great, including those which were especially honored by enemies. For instance neither Athena at Sparta nor Apollo at Athens seems to have wanted worship and honor during the bitter- est struggles between these cities in the fifth century B.C., and when Homer gives us his account of the sympathies of the gods during the Trojan War he does indeed represent Athene, for in- stance, as rejecting the Trojan petitions and readily listening to</page><page sequence="5">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 7 those of certain leading Achaians,2 but says not a word to indicate that either party ceased to worship even the most unfriendly deity. Following therefore the sound principle hypotheses non fingo I should hesitate to suppose the existence at any time, how- ever remote, of a state of affairs of which at best only the vaguest indications are to be found in our documents, literary or archae- ological. It remains a theoretical possibility, no more. Another explanation which occurs to me is this. Wherever they came from, the Achaians were past all question immigrants into Greece. Now polytheistic cults have a strong tendency to be local, not because a deity is thought to be narrowly confined, but be- cause it is supposed that he or she prefers to work wonders and answer prayers at one place rather than another. The succession of events is in all probability, first that the spot itself is held to be holy or mysterious for one reason or another, e.g., from the presence there of some striking natural phenomenon, such as vol- canic activity, or simply of a river or the like. Next comes the institution of some kind of rudimentary cult, not necessarily in- volving anything so elaborate as the erection of even the simplest and most unpretentious building, but including, sooner or later, some fairly regular recurrence of sacrifice and other ritual on the spot. Finally the power thought to be active there is named, either being identified with a known god or simply given a name or honorific title. Vergil, whose insight in religious matters is always good, gives what I regard as an admirable description of just such a process when he imaginatively reconstructs the prehistory of the Capitoline cult: 3 Hoc nemus, hunc, inquit, frondoso uertice collem, quis deus incertum est, habitat deus; Arcades ipsum credunt se uidisse Iouem, cum saepe nigrantem aegida concuteret dextra nimbosque cieret.

For worship of a deity normally hostile who has shown his un- friendliness in the most marked way, see A 450-474 (Apollo graciously accepts the prayer of Chryses on behalf of the Achaians and is pleased with their hymn). 'Verg., Aen. viii, 351-54.</page><page sequence="6">8 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ports of an epiphany of a definite and known god, Zeus himself, but not yet, it seems, so confidently accepted as to lead to the establishment of his cult and his alone. For Greece we have the great example of Delphoi, which, if any historical truth hides be- hind what seems to be its local legend, as given by Aeschylus,4 was the supposed place of revelations by more than one deity before Apollo finally took possession. Now if the Achaians, as they assuredly did, entered Greece from another land where no doubt they had had their local rites at holy places, they could not take these traditional sites with them,5 and in quitting them may have felt that they were quitting their gods as well, except the great sky-god, who is manifest everyplace where there is weather, and not least in the Temperate Zone, with its frequent changes from rain to shine and back again, and perhaps the Earth-Mother, if they had got so far as to conceive of one goddess who is respon- sible for the fertility of the whole earth, and not for some par- ticular patch of ground a few miles wide. In such a case, with their inveterate tendency to worship a number of deities having more or less specialized functions and often favorite places wherein to manifest their powers, they would readily learn of and accept any and every god or goddess whose favor was worth hav- ing, and worship him or her under the local name, if they could learn and pronounce it, and at the traditional spot, Hera for ex- ample at Argos. That something of this kind did occur is I think fairly obvious, given the number of cults known to classical Greece which prob- ably had their origins in days before the Achaians arrived. Polytheism is generally broad-minded and ready to welcome new gods, while the decline and even disappearance of old ones is by no means unheard of, witness for instance the small importance of Kronos in historical times. But if we look at the prayers in Homer, we shall find that distance from a famous holy place does ' Aesch., Eumen., i ff. 5 This of course does not exclude the possibility that the Achaians brought with them small portable sacred objects. Such things as the famous stone at Delphoi which was later (Hesiod, Theog. 497-500) shown as the identical object which Kronos swallowed by mistake for Zeus may for all we know have been imports of this kind. But being uninscribed and probably shapeless they would easily become unintelligible, retaining only a vague holiness.</page><page sequence="7">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 9 not mean forgetfulness of it. It is true that Chryses praying to Apollo invokes him by local titles: 6 KXVOL ,uv, &amp;ilpyvpo'ro?',&amp;; Xpv'u-v a-,u~/8'/3Ka; KIXXav T(e C aO:v, Teve"oto'L TE ?tL av'aa't~. But when Achilles prays earnestly for Patroklos' victory and safe return, he addresses Zeus in a manner quite irrelevant to the geo- graphy both of the Troad and of Phthia: Z6a va, A1ocvaZc, IIcXaoyLKec, TrXoOtL vatowv, "Sw v? /LGSeO"V SVOyXctupOV. An Achaian in Greece, to judge from this and other such passages, could perfectly well have continued to appeal to the gods of his ancestors in the land of their origin by the traditional names and with mention of the places where earlier generations had adored them. In that case we should find a number, great or small, of divine names with recognizable Greek etymologies and titles which no doubt would include some referring to the functions of the deity (as Artemis Agrotera, Apollo Nomios), but also others derived from place-names outside Greece and so giving welcome informa- tion concerning the original home of the invaders. But in fact we find neither such names nor such local titles, therefore no such theory can hold water. It seems to me therefore that there is much to be said for Herodotos' idea that the Greeks originally had no individual names, or at all events very few, for their gods, and that the majority of those known from Mycenaean and later times were taken over from the "Pelasgians," that is to say from non-Hel- lenic sources, Minoan, Helladic, or other, if others there were. Clearly, since our very earliest written documents are of the full Mycenaean period, and those very scanty and gradually being interpreted by the labors of Messrs. Ventris, Chadwick, Bennet and others, we can have no direct proof of the state of Achaian cults at the beginning of their arrival or infiltration into Greece, perhaps about 2ooo B.C. We must therefore consider if any analogies can be found, or any likely survivals detected, of a stage 6A 37-8. SII 223-34.</page><page sequence="8">10 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW in which either "Pelasgians" or Achaians "in all their sacrifices prayed unto The Gods." I think that such analogies and survivals can be had, both in Greece and outside it. Good fortune and Roman conservatism have preserved for us a stage of religious development from which classical Greek polytheism might well be supposed to have grown. Notoriously, the earliest Romans of whom we have any knowledge had no myths concerning their deities and were content to know, or feel that they knew, that the objects of their worship possessed numen, or whatever term was in vogue at that date, for the word numen itself has not been traced further back than the second century B.C. Not only had these early gods no myths that we can hear of, but they seem to have had very little personality of any kind, and it is remarkable that many of them have no individual names, but only class-designations. We may take as an example the list of divinities contained in the formula of deuotio.8 Iane, Iuppiter, Mars pater, Quirine, Bellona, Lares, Diui Nouensiles, Di Indigetes, Diui quorum est potestas nostrorum hostiumque, Dique Manes. Here we have the old triad of high gods, Juppiter Mars and Quir- inus, of whom the third is said on good authority to have been originally a foreigner, Sabine and not pure Roman, and the second has a name of very dubious etymology. Before them comes a god who, by what seems to me the only likely explanation of him and his functions,9 owes his origin to nothing more recondite than a gate (ianus) or a street-door, ianua, that is to the concentration of numen which gathers about any beginning, including the begin- ning of a city or house, the point at which one enters it. The list of individual names ends with Bellona, a very vague personality. The rest of the formula is taken up with class-names, some of them of very uncertain meaning, and two of them at least, the Nouen- sides and the Manes, seem never to have developed a singular. In other words, though a few high gods had been worshipped from SLivy, viii, 9, 6. *I remain quite unconvinced by the attempts, although they do not lack learning nor ingenuity, to make Janus something else than a door or gate, e.g., to mention the last that I have seen, L.

Phil. 15, 4, PP. 157-82).</page><page sequence="9">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 11 early times, the Romans very often were content to use formulae which more or less definitely indicated the sort of numen with which they were anxious then and there to establish contact, not the person who might be supposed to possess that numen and be open to respectful suggestions that it be used for the benefit of those in need of it. It is in keeping with this that a certain number of divine names show themselves on inspection to be very doubtfully names at all, but simply adjectives, no doubt descriptive or complimentary. The obscure Falacer was once important enough to have a priest of his own, although his functions are quite unknown to us; but Falacer is an adjective as well as a substantive, if indeed it is a substantive at all and not purely adjectival, for the priest was called flamen Falacer, an adjective of the same type as alacer.0o Quirinus, whatever be the true etymology of that hotly disputed name," is again an adjectival formation; he is the god who be- longs to or has some connection with . . . and the rest, the mean- ing of the first syllable, is to say the least of it not too lucid for us. I am inclined to add another to the list, the name of Romulus him- self. It means simply "Roman," as Siculus means Sicilian, and there is a piece of evidence, slight but ancient, to indicate that before ever Greek-inspired fantasy made him into an early king and a son of Mars, he was a deity in his own right, for the famous Argeerurkunde tells us 12 that he had an aedes, which whether it was identical with the celebrated casa Romuli or not is far more likely to be his temple, that being the meaning of the word in the singular generally and especially elsewhere in this venerable docu- ment, than his house. He may therefore in the remote past have been the deity who belonged to Rome; I am not now concerned with the equation of him with Quirinus, which is of about the middle of the first century B.C. Now it seems to me not impossible, but rather a natural evolu- tion, that there was a time when Greek thought concerning their gods was not much clearer, or their imagination not much more o Varro, de ling.

To take the second point first, a fundamental myth in the divine history as we have it is the succession of lords of the uni- verse, Uranos-Kronos-Zeus. It had long been suspected that the wild story of filial rebellions and castrations of fathers which we have in Hesiod and later writers was not of Greek origin. It may now, thanks to the recovery of some part of Hittite mythology, be regarded as certain that this is so, and either the Achaians learned it through their contacts, as yet very imperfectly known, with the Near East or else it is an inheritance from a dim, perhaps even pre-ethnic past when such savage fantasies were satisfactory to the rude ancestors of Achaians and Hittites alike. In either case, it is not due to specifically Greek fancy, but inherited or borrowed by speakers of Greek. I refer of course to the myth of Kumbarbi,13 with its sequel, the conflict of the weather-god, Te- shub or whatever he should be called, with the monster Ullikummi, the Typhoeus, as it would appear, of the Hittite-Hurrite tradition. Certain details, rightly emphasized by Lesky, seem to me to make it more probable that early Achaians took over the tale more or less as we now have it than that both they and their eastern neigh- bors had inherited it from some hypothetical earlier stage in their history. I am not without hope that later discoveries or elucida- tions of Asian texts may show us the origin of one of the most extraordinary features of the conflict between Zeus and Typhoeus, the capture by the monster of the god's sinews and their subse- quent recovery,'4 a detail not to be found in Hesiod or any other surviving early author, and to my mind completely non-Hellenic.

But to pass to the more important subject of religious feeling and, if we may use so intellectual a term, theological thought at an early stage of Greek history, I have elsewhere 15 suggested that we may distinguish two grades or classes of religion in quite early times, corresponding in some degree to the respective attitudes of Homer and Hesiod. The religion of the nobles consisted essen- tially, so it would seem, in the worship, unattended by any very profound awe, of anthropomorphic beings, clear-cut and brilliant figures, who had little about them that was magical or mysterious, though they did possess some powers not granted to humanity, such as walking invisible to earthly eyes. These beings were on the whole tolerably just and reasonable, about as much so as the p3ao-tLxE1 who worshipped them, but were no embodiments of jus- tice and morality in their ordinary conduct. They formed a su- perior class, as inaccessible to mankind as, if not more than, the status of nobility was to the common man. But the common people, if Hesiod may be taken as being to any extent their spokes- man, had, not exactly a different religion, but a different emphasis. Justice, since its opposite might mean acute suffering to them, was a quality on which great stress was laid; she is the daughter of Zeus himself, and if anyone wrongs her, she goes and complains to her great father and incites him to punish the evildoers. Hesiod urges this with such emphasis 16 that it would seem he feels it to be a doctrine universally held and welcomed, except perhaps by the "bribe-devouring barons" whom he warns of the wrath to come.

So much for the difference of stress; the gods, at least those who are most concerned with the doings of mankind, are thoroughly just, and that is what matters most, at least to the mortals whose ways they oversee di- rectly or through their many invisible agents. Now as to the nature of these gods themselves. We do of course meet the fa- miliar Homeric names s18 and have no reason to suppose that the peasants of Mycenaean and post-Mycenaean times doubted the existence of the great deities; once more to consult Hesiod, we find him weaving their genealogies and, if we may so call them, their biographies up to the time of writing, into a long poem, the first mythological and at the same time the first theological treatise in any European tongue. This, however, is not the place to look for popular belief, whether of the upper or lower classes, for it is the work of a systematizer, and moreover of one who is the espe- cial charge of the Muses; for being a Boiotian he lived near their traditional haunt on Helikon and he claims (I do not know why we should disbelieve him, considering his date and his obvious piety) that he had had a vision of them and attributed his poetical powers to their grace and favor. Hence the fervor of his address to them, far exceeding in length and elaboration anything in Homer."1 If we would hear Hesiod speaking for the peasantry or small-holders of his age and country, we must consult the Works and Days. Of this poem, again, we must regard, not so much the proem in which Hesiod invokes the goddesses of his worship, for it is not everyone who is favored by them, but rather the precepts which form the body of the work. And here at once we come across a figure not to be found in cult, nor even prominent in myth, and that is Eris, or rather the two Erides, whom our more ana- lytical speech would perhaps label Strife and Emulation respec- tively.20 Why is it, early reflection seems to have asked, that Is We now know that at least many of them are pre-Homeric by several centuries; the Linear B tablets give us with more or less certainty Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hermes, Ares ( ?), Paian, Dionysos, Artemis, Athene, Eleuthia (Eileithyia), the Winds, and sundry less familiar figures. 19 Theog. 1-1o4. 2 W. D. ii ff.</page><page sequence="13">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 15 some men quarrel bitterly with one another, either in actual armed fight or in such unprofitable civil disputes as that by which Perses robbed his brother of part of the common inheritance, whereas others, however bitter they may feel (for "potter is wroth with potter and wright with wright"), yet do nothing worse than strive hard to outdo rivals in honorable and useful pursuits? The an- swer seems to have come readily enough; they are urged by dai- monic powers stronger than themselves, for the evil Eris is honored of necessity, the good one rouses the most handless and sets him unwillingly to work more or less efficiently. And hardly are the Erides disposed of than we plunge into an elaborate story con- cerning that wide-spread figure of many folktales in many lands, the Trickster, whom Greek tradition styles the Foreseer, Prome- theus.21 In telling it, Hesiod is sorely hampered by his reverence for Zeus, who plainly was originally the victim of Prometheus' wiles; for the tale is to the effect that when men and gods met to determine how sacrificial victims ought to be shared between hu- man and divine recipients, the Trickster put all the best parts of the beast in a very plain-looking package, all the poorer into an- other which he made attractive by wrapping the bones and offal in fat, and then bade Zeus choose. The simple-minded god took the rich-looking bundle, and consequently all the best of the meat has been available to the feasters at the sacrifice ever since. In the Works and Days Hesiod says plainly that Zeus was deceived, but in the Theogony he hastily inserts an assurance that he saw through the trick, a detail quite inconsistent with the rest of the popular aetiological myth which it clearly is.22 The next part of the tale even Hesiod's piety cannot disguise; Prometheus fairly befooled Zeus by stealing fire, it would seem from Olympos or heaven, and hiding his theft in a stalk of giant fennel until, pre- sumably, he had rekindled the earthly fires which were out and could not be started again because the god had deprived the manna-ash fire-sticks of their power to produce heat by friction.23 2W.

We may therefore look with some confidence into the rest of the poem for specimens of popular thought of that day, thought of a kind which is apt to persist among the less progressive elements of any population until a date far later than its earliest discoverable traces. This is not to say that Hesiod represents a mere transcription of peasant beliefs. His was an original mind, the mind of a systematizer who was also something of a prophet of righteousness, nearly as zealous for it as his probable Hebrew contemporary Amos; but his background, which must to some extent condition the thought-forms of any man, however original, was that of the small farmers of Boiotia, a region which continued to be conservative in many ways, hence no doubt its reputation for dullness among the quick-witted, ex- perimental Athenians. If now we pass beyond the history of the Five Ages, the origins of which are too imperfectly known for anything to be founded on it (though it is not unlikely that Oriental influence has been at work here), we find him adjuring the erring Perses to pay atten- tion to Justice. On the whole, we shall be likeliest to interpret his meaning correctly if we spell her name throughout with a capital, AIK7-, not 8K7-, although here we meet with one of the stock diffi- culties of Greek, which has no mechanical means of distinguish- ing between an abstraction and what we now call a personification. But anything which can not only be roughly treated, lament, hide in a mist and bring evil to men, but also triumph over Hybris in the end,24 is surely more of a person than a something which is perceptible only to abstract thought or at best poetical imagina- tion.

We are, moreover, not confined to Hesiodic or pseudo-Hesiodic evidence for his importance, since Apollo's own priestess testified to him in the famous oracle given to Glaukos, son of Epikydes, somewhere about 550 B.C.27 He has, she told the offender, a nameless son who has neither hands nor feet, yet can follow swiftly after a perjurer until he brings him and all his line to ruin. This is truly a deity not lightly to be neglected, yet he has really no name, merely a sort of epithet making it clear what form his divine power, his numen or mana, takes. He is a little more personal and definite than most Roman deities, but not much more. And it is not without significance, I think, that im- mediately after speaking of him and of his fellow-abstraction Justice, Hesiod the theologian gives us another account of the results of justice and injustice respectively; those who practice them are rewarded or punished, as the case may be, by none other than Zeus.28 Thus he gives us our choice; we may say that almost nameless powers punish the guilty (and presumably spare the innocent, but that is not what popular ethics generally incline to stress), or that there is a great and righteous ruler of the universe who sees to it. A moment later he has returned to what seems to me a more popular and more nearly primitive view of the matter. How does Zeus manage to oversee the numerous doings of men everywhere? The answer is simple; he has "thrice innumerable" immortals at work, who go everywhere on earth "clad in mist," i.e., invisible, besides the general oversight exercised by Dike, who regularly informs him of "crooked" dealings.29 We are not with- out grounds for saying that this is a popular and long-lived belief, especially as it has its parallels among other peoples who believe 'Theog. 231-32.

His philosophizing slave Onesimos is of opinion that to oversee all the inhabitants of the (civilized) world (at 7ira^o-at roAXES) would be too laborious a task for the gods; he modestly estimates the number of human beings in question at thirty million. To save all this trouble therefore they have given everyone a character ('rpo'0og), who commands the garrison that keeps the man and all that goes to make him up in proper subjection. This, according to his merits (presumably), brings about his salvation or his ruin and should therefore be treated as a god and its favor sought. It is probably from Diphilos, i.e., again from New Comedy, that Plautus got that famous passage in which he informs the audience, through the mouth of Arcturus, that the stars are assigned by Juppiter to over- see mankind and report to him.32 So here once more we find, not exactly replacing but certainly reinforcing the one supreme god, a great number of nameless but venerable beings whose vigilance nothing can escape. I incline to think that some such view was so firmly established as early as Hesiod that a mention of it was forced upon him, flatly though it contradicts his own assertion a few lines further on 33 that the eye of Zeus sees and notes every- thing. His fellow-countryman Pindar, some centuries later, was bolder in this respect, for his Apollo needs no spying bird to tell him of Koronis' infidelity but is informed of it by his own "all- knowing mind," a fairly plain hint that the poet knew and rejected the folktale.34 Continuing, we find a number of passages in which no named deity is spoken of, although divine reactions to human conduct are often mentioned.

The desirable kind of wealth does not come by robbery but is "godgiven." 38 If anyone "gets plunder from his tongue," it is "the gods" who ruin him.39 Zeus appears once more as the punisher of various particularly detestable sinners,"4 but Perses is advised to make regular sacrifices to the best of his ability in honor of "the im- mortal gods" generally.4' Zeus again can easily provide, if he will, for a family which has several sons, though the canny peasant mind apparently prefers to limit the number of sons to one and not trouble the god.42 When next he is mentioned it is simply as a sender of rain in its season.43 Athena gets as it were a salutation in passing; the joiner who puts the plough together is her servant, in other words that is a job for a skilled craftsman.44 It is still Demeter, this time coupled with the "chthonian Zeus," presumably Pluton,45 to whom the farmer ought to pray before starting to plough. Zeus reappears in three passages46 in his capacity as a weather-god, responsible for the rain which comes, or does not come, at the proper time to help the husbandman. A little later 47 we catch, perhaps, an echo of the cult of Dionysos in the month-name Lenaion, but unless we reckon the wind-name Boreas and the poetical expression "works of Aphrodite" for "sexual experi- ence," 48 the poet continues his good advice for many verses with- out mentioning any deities, until once more Zeus makes his ap- pearance as the "completer" or "perfecter" of a period of sixty days after which it is advisable to prune the vines.49 Except for SHes., W.

Even when Hesiod is giving his short and timid directions to sailors, if one must do such a risky thing as go to sea (for his own part, his nautical experience has been confined to one trip across the Euripos and back again)," Zeus is to the fore, still as weather- god, in company with Poseidon, whose ill-will towards someone's ship is the other suggested explanation of a wreck.54 It is note- worthy that so important a matter as marriage is dealt with on a purely secular basis; great care must be taken in selecting a wife of suitable age, the daughter of a neighbor for choice, but not a word is said of reverence towards the deities governing wedlock; perhaps that is simply taken for granted.55 In the series of precepts with which the "Works" end, we still hear little of specific gods. The hands must be washed before making the morning libation to Zeus and "the other Immortals." 56 There are certain indelicacies to be avoided in face of the Sun (it is not even mentioned that he is a god), and at night, "for the nights belong to the Blessed Ones," and the "godly man" (that apparently is the meaning of O6Eo0 in this passage) will act accord- ingly.57 Like decencies are to be observed before the domestic hearth, and here again we are not told, what no doubt everyone knew, that Hestia is a goddess.58 Fording a river is an act to be undertaken with due ceremonial, otherwise "the gods" will be righteously angry.59 Again, a pot of warm water ought not to be 50 Ibid., 597, 614. 1 Ibid., 626. 52 Ibid., 638. 5 Ibid., 650 ff. 54Ibid., 667-68. 55Ibid., 695 ff.

There is, a Polynesian or a Melanesian might say, mana in it."' Whoever wrote the "Days," he is not much more specific than the undoubted Hesiod. All days come from Zeus, be they lucky or unlucky.62 Certainly, for how should we know that another day has come or gone save by noticing the appearance of the sky, light or dark? One god is spoken of in accounting for the holiness of the seventh day of the month; it is Apollo's birthday.63 But the only other great deity to be mentioned at all is Demeter, and she only in the familiar kenning.64 Along with the mythological figure of Eris, however, we hear of a vague but formidable god, Horkos, who is simply the oath hypostatized. I have already discussed him (above, pp. 16-17). The poem ends, be it Hesiod's conclusion or an interpolator's, with a precept as vague as anything that has gone before. He has nothing to fear from unlucky days, it would seem, who has the appropriate knowledge and by using it lives blamelessly in the sight of the Immortals (not of any named de- ities), interprets omens aright and shuns transgressions. Thus we find, when Hesiod is not theologizing but giving advice to small landholders like himself, comparatively little mention of specific gods and their cult. Nothing is said of how any particular power is to be approached; presumably Demeter or Apollo, for instance, would have an available priest or priestess who would know the local ritual, and so expert advice could be got when needed. But certainly the impression left on any careful reader is * Ibid., 748-49, 735-36, 742-43. 6'Ibid., 763-64. 62Ibid., 765, 769. 6 Ibid., 77f. above, p.

Zeus, Demeter, Hestia, were all visibly present to countrymen, and their names at all events were known, together with something of their ritual, enough at least to make a daily liba- tion possible, periodical sacrifice to the corn-goddess not too diffi- cult (we are not told that her priestess was called in, though it is of course possible), and seemly conduct before the domestic hearth a matter of habit for all respectable householders. Anyone who looks into Cato's strange commonplace-book, the de agri cultura, will find a very similar picture in the observances pre- scribed for the landowner and his servants, who certainly are no priests and are Romanly incurious as to the nature and personal- ity of the powers invoked. If now we look further back than either Hesiod or Homer, we find in the Linear B tablets already mentioned evidence of a cer- tain lack of curiosity, at all events at Pylos, as to what the per- sonal name of the deity worshipped with apparent fervor might be. Tablet after tablet mentions offerings made, or has other refer- ences, to someone styled merely Potnia, in other words Our Lady, or The Mistress. It is quite the exception when, on a tablet from Knossos (V 52), we find the title coupled with a famous name, a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja, i.e., Our Lady Athena. Someone else, again, is mentioned simply as "the god" (unless the word is already of two genders, when it might be "the goddess"), for on several Pylian tablets, for instance EooI, we hear of a person described as te-o-jo do-e-ro, or do-e-ra, that is the male or female slave of the deity, OEO^o 8&amp;iXos (8o;Xv). Lack of a name therefore by no means con- notes unimportance, for the evidence is sufficient to show that these unnamed powers had quite considerable households, so to call them, at their disposal, in other words the amount of eccle- siastical property allotted to them was relatively large. If we could learn more of the religious life of these Mycenaean commu- nities, we should probably discover that sacrifices and festivals were neither uncommon nor on a very small scale, but details are unfortunately lacking. This much appears, that to worship un- named gods was a fairly common thing. Now and then we catch</page><page sequence="21">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 23 glimpses of a terminology still obscure to us. Who, for example, is the ma-te-re te-i-ja to whom ( for the phrase is clearly in the dative case) somebody recorded on the tablet from Pylos, 1955 (1202) makes offering of a quantity of scented oil? Is she Mother Theia, a deity mentioned a time or two in Hesiod and stated by Pindar 65 to have many names, or the Divine Mother, a quite con- ceivable title for a goddess, and not necessarily implying that she is a mother in the physical sense, compare the common use of Mater in the titles of Roman goddesses, who neither marry nor bear children, or finally (for adjectives in -io- seem to be often equivalent to genitives in Mycenaean as in later Greek), the Mother of the Gods? This last, Mr. Chadwick's suggestion, seems to me the least likely for so early a date, but we know too little about the religion of this obscure period to be unduly dogmatic. At all events, here is another deity with a doubtful name, if any, considering that the Titaness Theia herself is simply the Divine One. Another tablet, PY (1955) 1219, if Professor Palmer's interpre- tation is right 66 gives us a group of deities having what seems a strongly Roman flavor, i.e., to savor of a stage of religious develop- ment very like that of the Romans in the most ancient recoverable stage of their religious history. It reads wa-no-so-i po-se-da-o-ne, followed by the ideogram signifying oil, and therefore records an offering. It seems as certain as anything in this obscure field can be that the second group of signs is the name of Poseidon in the dative case. But who or what is the wa-no-so-i? The Linear B script had apparently no means of writing a final consonant, hence we are at liberty to supply one, and the only possible letter to give a Greek inflexion is n. This gives us a dual, Favo6-o-oL,"7 and there is evidence that the masculine forms of the dual were already 5 Pindar, I. v, i. For most of these references I am indebted to Professor L. R.

Thus we get the "two queens" (great ladies, princesses, or what- ever word we prefer as a translation of anassa), associated with Poseidon in a way very reminiscent of the Moles Martis, Virites Quirini and other Roman groups, save that the name of the god who would appear to be the chief of the group is not in the genitive case but left parallel to those of the apparently minor members.68 And this leads us to a curious set of facts recently drawn attention to by that diligent investigator of obscure corners of Greek cult, Bengt Hemberg.69 He points out that anax, anassa, anakes seem in the oldest records available to him (he had not access when he wrote to the tablet I have just quoted) not to be used indiscrim- inately of any and every deity. Homer never applies any of them to Ares, Dionysos, Hera or Aphrodite, who one would think have as good a right as any to be styled "lord" and "lady" or "king" and "queen." He hardly uses them of Helios, Hypnos, Hades, Hermes, Athena or Demeter, but twice of a river-god whose name is unknown to the speaker, Odysseus, thrice of Hephaistos, i.e., once in twenty mentions of him, and quite commonly of Zeus, Poseidon and Apollo."0 Hemberg comes to the very reasonable conclusion that the words were to begin with titles of certain de- ities only. Now it seems we have found two of these deities, and they have, so far as our records go, no names. He then proceeds, after briefly examining post-Homeric litera- ture, which seems to have partly forgotten or not noticed the epic restrictions on the use of the words in question,7 to look at the direct evidence from cult, i.e., at those passages from surviving books or inscriptions which tell us that a deity, named or un- named, was adored under one or another of these titles. He finds eleven instances of the deity so called being identified, more or less positively, with some known god or goddess, not one of the Dioskuroi; eight in which we hear of no identification; three cases s Aulus Gellius xiii, 23 (22), 2.

The name at least of Helen herself is not Hellenic; the manner of the birth of all three is remarkable, quite unlike that of normal figures of mythology, who are brought forth by women or goddesses in the usual way. The attachment of the Twin Brethren to any of the great cycles of saga is very loose, for Homer rather pointedly excludes them from the Trojan War,74 and their connection with the Argonautic adven- tures amounts to hardly more than a boxing-match won by Poly- deukes against the churlish Amykos. On their own behalf, they hover on the border between mortal and immortal, being either always together or never together as they pass on alternate days between heaven and the under-world. They carry off as brides two girls, one of whom has a Titanic name, Phoibe. Their chief function, which bears no very clear relation to their fragmentary mythology, is to rescue their worshippers when in danger at sea, or much more rarely, in battle. Their emblem, the dokana, was simply two upright poles with a third across their tops, whether this was a schematic representation of the two brothers standing with their hands on each other's shoulders, a model of a trilithon, or something entirely different. In any case it was very unlike what we think of as characteristically Greek cult-objects, for these are either more or less developed statues or else unwrought stones or stocks, leaving aside such things as holy trees, which again owe nothing to art, whereas the dokana were a manufactured ' Hemberg, op. cit., pp. 14-44. 8 F.

Again, the characteristic headgear of the Twins is the "Phrygian" cap which is also that commonly worn by another doubtfully Hellenic personage, Odysseus. All these things suggest very strongly that the Dioskuroi, whatever their exact origin, owe not a little to sources quite outside the main- stream of classical, or the later pre-classical, Greek religion. That they go back ao something local but pre-Hellenic, i.e., Pelasgian in the ancient sense, is perhaps too much to assume. It is one of the services of the ingenious F. Dornseiff to scholarship that he continually reminds us that Greece lay on the fringe of the Near Eastern cultures, which undoubtedly influenced early myths and cannot be dismissed without argument as possible sources for early cults as well. Still, the distribution of cults of the Twins suggest that they are Hellenic in the local sense, i.e., belonging to Greece proper, whatever be the date of their origin. Perhaps Homer, and those that follow him, are not so far wrong when they say that Lakedaimon was their father-land, provided that is that we understand Lakedaimon before the Dorians, even before the Achaians. In any case, we seem to have here another instance of gods who, if not exactly nameless, are vaguely and shiftingly named, and form a little group within which the distinction of personalities is as good as lost; the best the mythologists can do is to make one brother a rider (which they both are), the other a boxer. Another and a much larger work of Hemberg provides us with a most welcome store of material for the study of a number of groups of still vaguer deities.7" Besides the Kabeiroi themselves, whose non-Hellenic name indicates that they are foreigners, or just possibly pre-Greek, he has assembled a great number of other gods who form small groups, are very often described as "great," and commonly have either no names within the group or names patently the result of identifications by theologically-minded wor- shippers. Thus the chief of the Kabeiroi themselves seems often to have been known simply as Kabeiros, his younger attendant and cup-bearer merely as Pais. How to distribute the recorded names Axieros, Axiokersos and Axiokersa between these two and a pre- sumable third, female figure we do not know. In any case there 5 Bengt Hemberg, Die Kabiren, Uppsala 1950.</page><page sequence="25">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 27 is very little mythology attached to them, and what there is is late and may well have been corrupted in passing through our wit- nesses, some of them Christian and therefore hostile. The Great Gods of Samothrace, very often called Kabeiroi, seem not to have borne that name on the island itself. It need hardly be said that the Dioskuroi intrude into this region as into that of the Anaktes, and some boldly declared that the senior Kabeiros was no other than Zeus, and the "child" was Dionysos, but generally such rash identifications seem not to have been made. The generality of worshippers were, it seems, content to adore august and tradi- tional but vaguely conceived beings, who had in some cases at least power to do such useful things as encouraging the fertility of the earth and so forth. That one group, the Gods of Samo- thrace, showed its power also at sea is not very remarkable; they were adored on an island, and, since many groups had chthonian features or what appear to be such, their power might well extend to such things as quieting the storm-winds, which were associated with chthonians at least to the extent of being offered the same kind of (black) victims.76 Thus we find, apparently from quite early times and persisting to a late period, gods, sometimes single, sometimes in small groups, worshipped up and down the Greek world, who had little indi- viduality, often no known names, next to no myths, and generally scarcely any of the characteristics of the Olympians and the greater chthonians whom we think of as typically Hellenic. I see no reason to doubt that Herodotos was acquainted with some, probably many, of these obscure cults, and he perhaps founded his theory upon what he had observed. It remains to ask what a modern may reasonably make of the facts. I would begin by admitting that I have no ready-made solution of the problem, but merely a suggestion. It is, that the adoption, from whatever sources, of personal names for gods and goddesses, with all the attendant apparatus of myth and genealogy, was in its origin the work of Mycenaean nobles. We know from Homer that the heroes were ceremonious in addressing each other, in sharp contrast to the informal salutations used in democratic Athens. At least the patronymic was regularly used in any kind " Aristophanes, Frogs 847, and commentators there.</page><page sequence="26">28 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of formal public address; Agamemnon is called "Atreus-son" not only by Chryses, who is presenting a petition to him, but by Achilles, who is abusing him.77 Some laudatory phrase may re- place it,78 such as a reference to the relation of the person addressed to deity, or a mention of his honorable office; or we may get full name and title, with a compliment added.79 Now it appears to me that, at least to these nobles, the gods were a yet higher class of society, comparable to their own, and that there- fore a like politeness was called for in speaking to them. It was, however, impossible to use the regular forms unless there were names, preferably also patronymics of some kind, available. It is a curious fact that lOEa never acquired a vocative case until post- classical times, although 6Ea has one from Homer down and 8ait-ov occurs in that case now and then. OE6 was no one's name, till Jewish influence caused it to be regarded, at least in Jewish or Judaeo-Christian circles, as a kind of substitute for the ineffable appellation of the one Deity, but more nearly a predicate. Hence to speak politely to any god a heros must, by direct enquiry or otherwise, find out what he was called and for choice whose son he was also. Now if in early days that state of things was general which we have found sporadically subsisting in later times, namely wide-spread worship of deities who might form groups but had very little personality, the native stores of information on this im- portant matter must have been scanty. The enquirers therefore would draw upon foreign material if it was to hand, and it be- comes increasingly evident as our knowledge of proto-historic times in Greece and the neighboring countries improves that it was available, if not in Greece itself, then from the cultures of the Near East, possibly not even excluding Herodotos' favorite region, Egypt. The tacit assumption which seems to underlie so much an- cient theological speculation, that all men worship the same gods, or some of the same gods, merely varying their names, would make such borrowings all the easier. Hence it was no difficult matter to accept, for instance, instead of a vague deity or group of de- ities who protected herdsmen and their cattle, the clear-cut figure 77A 17, 122, 232. 8 A 74, 334. SI 96.</page><page sequence="27">DIVINE NAMES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 29 of Apollo Nomios, supposing that that was a primary function of the god of Delphoi. His importance would make it natural to at- tach him to the native sky-god, and if indeed he brought with him an Oriental mother, the Lady (Lada), she, with a little mispro- nunciation in Greek mouths, quickly became the Titaness Lato or Leto, and a fitting mate for Zeus. He, like an Achaian chieftain, could be hospitable to other mates than his lawful wife, and their offspring had a recognized place in the divine family. Hence a genealogy was easily arranged, not only for so outstanding a figure as Apollo but for other borrowings from various sources. Diony- sos, for instance, seems always to have been son of Dios and Zemelo,so that is to say of Father Sky and Mother Earth, in his native regions of Thrace and Phrygia, at any rate in the latter. These parents having obviously foreign names, it was not un- natural to attach the mother to a foreigner already well-known, Kadmos the "Phoenician," and make "Semele" his beautiful but ill-fated daughter. The Sky-Father hardly needed translation. And so, could we but know the full history of the various adop- tions, the process doubtless went on with deity after deity. It is not to be forgotten that in early times the outstanding, if not the only, kind of systematization was the genealogical tree. As in hu- man society a person's place was made clear when it was known whose son (or daughter) he or she was, so with many other things, including what we should call abstract qualities, a fact to which Hesiod's Theogony bears ample testimony. Such diverse con- ceptions, for instance, as Righteous Indignation, Deceit, Pleasure of Love, Old Age, and Strife seemed to become more intelligible when they were put together as the children of Night.s8 It is not always easy for us today to see what the connection was; clearly there must have been one to the mind of Hesiod. If this was so in what one might almost call the realm of abstract philosophy, or moralizing, it was much more the case when gods were in question, since they were not merely subjects for private speculation but also recipients of cult, daily, monthly or yearly as might happen. The worshipper was not only vaguely aware that he was addressing 8 If, that is to say, Zemelo as an earth-goddess survives the criticism of Professor Calder in M.A.M.

With such a being he could enter into intelligible relations, free from mystical fog or the oppression of the unknown or unknowable. The typical Greek liked his ideas clear-cut, in religion as in other spheres. There is a further indication that it was upper-class wor- shippers, in other words Achaian or Mycenaean nobles, who intro- duced the names. The vulgar have always and everywhere been suspicious of foreigners, even if they live but a few miles away and speak a closely related dialect of the same tongue. But wherever a noble class exists, it tends to be international. This is certainly true of Homeric nobles, and we may, I think, safely assume it of their predecessors, the barons who owned the overlordship of an Agamemnon or an Atreus. Menelaos spends much time in foreign parts on his way home, and gathers "much livelihood" there, how if not from the usual presents bestowed on a guest at his departure? 82 He was not a trader, and carried no stock with him, and he is himself generous, as becomes a wealthy noble, to his own guests.83 This tolerance of the foreigner holds good even in time of war, witness the agreement of Diomedes and Glaukos to avoid combat with one another "even in the thick of the fight," because there is a hereditary guest-friendship between their houses.84 Therefore an Achaian gentleman would welcome a for- eign god, as he would welcome a foreign visitor of his own class, and treat him with the honor due to his celestial rank. So I would provisionally modify Herodotos' theory somewhat as follows. In early days the Greek had very few personal names of deities, but invoked "the god," "the goddess" and so forth, adding it might be some laudatory title, as "good" or "powerful." This to some extent remained true of popular cults, many of which seem to have formed no part of what I have already called the mainstream of Greek religion and its attendant myths.

But it was different with the nobles. They no doubt would be courteous to the lesser powers, as Odysseus is to the local Nymphs in Ithaca,s7 for it would obviously be silly to offend even the humblest possessor of some modicum of divine power, and in any case, why insult one's own vassals by slighting the objects of their worship? But being great themselves, they would prefer to deal with the great, and to do so they must have the materials for the proper formulae of po- lite address, names and relationships. By what means they sought these out we probably shall never know fully, though as our ig- norance of the non-Greek cultures with which the early Greeks were brought into contact is gradually dispelled, we shall no doubt get at least broad hints at the way by which this or that divine name came within the knowledge of Mycenaean gentry. The re- sult was that first the upper classes and, following their lead in this as in other things, the lower orders became convinced that this or that name was appropriate for the wielder of such-and-such a kind of mana, and that he or she was son, daughter, brother, sis- ter or what-not of their own sky- and weather-god. To address the power in question accordingly would be a natural result, the more scrupulous adding, at least in later times, the famous formula EL'EE O1rWTO KaL oT1TOEY XaipEL ovo/La?o/LEVO, or one of its variants.88 We don't know, Plato is careful to explain, what the gods call themselves, though of course whatever names they do use must be the right ones; 89 but surely, we may add, a careful worshipper might judge from the fact that Poseidon, for example, did on See M.
