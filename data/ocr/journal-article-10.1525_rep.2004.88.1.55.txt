<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CANNON SCHMITT Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics I I D  P (1893), a remarkable nostalgic reverie about a journey to the fabled land of its title, novelist and ornithologist W.H. Hud- son claims that what cannot be forgotten is that which moves the emotions most powerfully—in his case, the plains of Patagonia.1 Hudson further contends that the desolate landscape’s memorability derives from its function as an instigation to remembering, and so returning to, an earlier mode of being. Describing the feelings that increasingly came over him during solitary rides on horseback through the Patagonian countryside, he writes: ‘‘Mymind . . . transformed itself from a thinking machine into a machine for some other unknown purpose. . . . My state was one of suspense and watchfulness.’’2 The cessation of thought, its replacement by appar- ently more primitive or basic mental states such as ‘‘suspense’’ and ‘‘watchfulness,’’ the advent of an expectant orientation toward the future that nonetheless remains in an eternal present: forHudson these changes indicate nothing other than a rever- sion to savagery. ‘‘For I had undoubtedly gone back,’’ he concludes, ‘‘and that state of intense watchfulness, or alertness rather, with suspension of the higher intellectual faculties, represented the emotional state of the pure savage.’’3 Leaving civilization behind, the wanderer in an alien land is restored, for a time, to an elemental self—and so remembers ever after where and when that resto- ration took place: the sequence derives from a more or less standard version of ‘‘go- ing native,’’ a narrative in which becoming savage amounts to revisiting the youth of the human race, turning back the evolutionary clock so as to enable the return to an earlier (and sometimes, as in this case, better) mode of being. Such a narrative typically depends on the infectious presence of ‘‘actual’’ savages, and at other points in Idle Days in Patagonia Hudson does find in the aboriginal inhabitants of South America remainders and reminders of an earlier age of human development, reve- nant ancestors incongruously leading outmoded lives contemporaneous with their up-to-date descendants. In a gesture Johannes Fabian diagnoses as the ‘‘denial of coevalness’’ and Anne McClintock calls the deployment of ‘‘anachronistic space,’’ he portrays himself as occupying a present understood as the era of the modern while representing indigenous peoples or ‘‘savages’’ as out of step with modernity’s  Tracing Charles Darwin’s repeated invocations of his initial encounter with the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, in this essay I argue that those invocations constitute a ‘‘savage mnemonics’’—a rela- tion to savagery that clarifies the nature of the work of memory demanded by the effort to grasp evolution- ary theory. / R     88.

Going native in this instance does not entail (re)joining the reified memories that are present-day savages so much as turning the sensory deprivation of Patagonia to account in the service of remembering the savage within. The narrative is stripped bare, and this is possible only because of Hudson’s belief that he has passed through a more primitive stage of development, a stage that has somehow been preserved intact and to which he can thus return. Implicitly endorsing a metaphorical version of Ernst Haeckel’s dictum that ontogeny recapit- ulates phylogeny (that is, that the embryological development of the individual or- ganism repeats in condensed form the entire series of evolutionary phases that the species to which it belongs has passed through), Hudson further imagines that cer- tain moments along the phylogenetic path to the present can be revisited, recap- tured, lived again.5 In viewing nineteenth-century Europeans (and European Americans such as himself ) as the end point on an evolutionary time line, a culmination in relation to which other peoples and cultures represent so many fascinating or disturbing but at any rate defunct stops along the way, Hudson stands heir to a long series of thinkers. As Robert Young notes, early in the nineteenth century it was John Stuart Mill who, borrowing from historiographical models developed during the Scottish Enlightenment, ‘‘formalized [the relation between civilized and savage] as a hier- archy of the historical stages of man, bringing geography and history together in a generalized scheme . . . that identified civilization with race.’’6 Significant contribu- tors to such developmental or stadialist thinking after Mill include T.H. Huxley and E. B. Tylor, both of whom Hudson cites.7 But for Hudson—and indeed for virtually everyone writing on or thinking about ‘‘savages’’ in the second half of the nineteenth century—the paramount point of reference is notMill, Huxley, or Tylor but Charles Darwin. Hudson can remember being savage because he cannot forget Darwin. Darwinian theory persuasively anchored the trope of anachronistic space in biology, giving scientific credibility to what had been little more than metaphor. More important still, Darwin’s own textual production from first to last takes shape in relation to savagery: for Darwin at his desk in Kent no less than for Hudson on the plains of Patagonia, the savage is unforgettable. Writing over a period from the 1830s to the 1870s, Darwin repeatedly invokes savages: in the midst of, and then again when bringing to a close, the account of his youthful circumnavigation of the globe; in the last few pages of the first full- scale elaboration of the theory of evolution by means of natural selection; as part of the conclusion of his efforts to demonstrate the applicability of that theory to humans; and, finally, when drawing up a collection of autobiographical notes on his life near its end. Savages, although seen as lacking a sense of history and hence possessing nomeaningful past of their own, refuse to be relegated to Darwin’s past.8 56 R     </page> <page sequence="3"> Returning to them at crucial moments of introspection, retrospection, and summa- tion, he seems as incapable of moving beyond them as he believes them to be of moving beyond their state of savagery without the European intervention that will either civilize them or lead to their extinction. While at points material to the theo- retical explication and empirical demonstration of the workings of evolution— their supposed position between ‘‘civilized’’ humans and other animalsmakes them indispensable to the argument that, like all other organic beings, humans evolved from earlier forms of life—savages in their various appearances in Darwin’s work exceed evidentiary and forensic functions. The shock he evinces at the sight of them and the thought of their proximity to civilized humanity ensures that Darwin can- not forget them. That same shock, however, also demands that savages be, if not precisely forgotten, then at least displaced from their position in a theory to which they nevertheless remain ineluctably central. In what follows I trace the workings inDarwin’s corpus of this savagemnemon- ics, which comprises two distinct but inextricably conjoined elements. On one hand, Darwin exploits a mnemonics of savagery, turning to savages in remem- brance of the origins of the civilized. In doing so he takes up and strengthens the hierarchical narrative of human development running from the Scottish Enlighten- ment through Mill to Hudson and beyond. On the other hand, Darwin refuses the anamnesis afforded by such a mnemonics. In particular, postulating human evolution requires that he distance himself from the savage, try to forget the savage’s kinship with the civilized. This vacillation between total recall and deliberate am- nesia may appear idiosyncratic or pathological—a Darwinian version of Freud’s repetition compulsion, perhaps, with the trauma of initial contact repeated end- lessly in a fruitless search for mastery. Its insistent presence, though, marks a signal moment in theVictorian relation to the primitive: a definitive version of the familiar story of civilization’s construction of itself in opposition to savagery, such vacillation reveals the paradoxical imperative within that story for the civilized, in constituting themselves as such, to take on the ‘‘savage’’ attribute of disregarding the very past that makes them who they are. Savage mnemonics also clarifies the nature of the work of memory demanded by the effort to grasp evolution, revealing, in the con- text of evolutionary theory, the imperative to remember as a necessary precursor to and component of the ability to understand. Finally, insofar as it stands as an exception to and even inversion of that work, Darwin’s savage mnemonics shows that, in a world otherwise completely assimilated to the natural and the animal— in which ‘‘man,’’ as Nancy Stepan puts it, is ‘‘merged . . . in animal nature’’—sav- ages for Darwin occupy the sole remaining locus of the human.9 I Darwin’s initial and defining encounter with savagery took place in South America during the journey around the globe he completed aboard HMS Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 57 </page> <page sequence="4"> Beagle between 1831 and 1836, a journey that might fairly be described as having had everything to do with time. Robert FitzRoy, captain of the Beagle during those years, writes that he and his crew set out on the voyage ‘‘entertaining the hope that a chain of meridian distances might be carried around the world.’’10 To this end, the ship maintained a battery of no fewer than twenty-two chronometers (deemed so essential by FitzRoy that he paid for some of them out of his own pocket), the careful use of which would establish precise longitudinal positions and aid espe- cially in the mapping of the southern coastline of South America. This mapping itself had another kind of temporal resonance. It was timely in that, in the wake of a series of independence struggles touched off by the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the Americas in the 1830s were for the British once again a ‘‘new world’’: newly opened to trade, investment, and exploration after centuries of inaccessibility.11 Darwin’s biographer Janet Browne notes: ‘‘The whole point of the British Admiralty’s desire to chart southern Latin America was to enable in- formed decisions to be made on naval, military, and commercial operations along the unexplored coastline south of Buenos Aires and to enable Britain to establish strong footholds in these areas, so recently released from their commitment to trade only with Spain and Portugal.’’12 In still another temporal register, Darwin’s own scrutiny of the geology, flora, and fauna of the region provided him with the data on which to construct what might be termed a ‘‘new’’ (or simply newly discovered) past for life on the planet, that past implied by the theory of evolution by natural selection propounded in On the Origin of Species (1859). At first a taxonomic exercise in filling out more and more blank spaces in Linnaeus’s static catalog of life, Dar- win’s assiduous investigation of the living archive that was South America eventu- ally contributed to the transformation of taxonomy into genealogy, opening up a biological time as profound as the ‘‘deep’’ geological time Charles Lyell proposed in his Principles of Geology (1830–33).13 Occupying a strikingly complex position in relation to such novel temporal depths are savages and Darwin’s relations with and memory of them. To attempt to get at that complexity, fraught as it is with the question of looking back, it seems best to begin with Darwin’s most evidently retrospective work, the posthumously published Autobiography (1887). Written over several months in 1876, six years be- fore its author’s death, the slim Autobiography resembles a desultory assortment of anecdotes much more than the masterful marshaling of great moments in the life of a great man that might be expected. Like more recognizable autobiographical enterprises, however, Darwin’s, too, is placed under the sign of memory: the top of the first page bears the words ‘‘Recollections of the Development of my mind and character.’’14 Such a title assigns two roles for memory in the work to follow. ‘‘Recol- lections’’ promises something like that deliberate use of memory peculiar to auto- biographical production: the selection and arrangement of remembered moments from childhood and youth so as to reconstruct a past sufficient to explain the adult- hood that follows as culmination. BecauseDarwin seeks to give an account, though, 58 R     </page> <page sequence="5"> not only of the events of his life but also of ‘‘the Development of [his] mind and character,’’ memory in the Autobiography is not understood as a technology of com- position alone, nor as a mere repository of raw material; it is also an object of scru- tiny in itself. Thus, when turning near the end of the text to an inventory of themental facul- ties that enabled him, as he puts it in characteristically self-effacing fashion, to ‘‘[in- fluence] to a considerable extent the beliefs of scientific men on some important points,’’ Darwin addresses his own faculties of recollection directly: Mymemory is extensive, yet hazy: it suffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that I have observed or read something opposed to the conclusion which I am drawing, or on the other hand in favor of it; and after a time I can generally recollect where to search for my authority. So poor in one sense is my memory, that I have never been able to remember for more than a few days a single date or line of poetry.15 If we can attend to this statement without feeling too implicated in its disarmingly acute articulation of a certain kind of scholarly recall, we will see that the memory it describes, ‘‘extensive’’ but also ‘‘hazy’’ and ‘‘poor,’’ might pose difficulties for the production of a text like The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), more than eight hundred pages in length and replete with minute behavioral and morphological details about an immense variety of animals—including, crucially and infamously, humans. To enable that production, to solidify the extensiveness and minimize the haze, Darwin fashioned an elaborate prosthesis for himself: else- where in the Autobiography he tells of the series of abstracts and indices he made of each book he ever read, mnemotechnic and compositional aids that he consulted anew each time he sat down to work.16 The construction and employment of this prosthetic memory, immensely sug- gestive insofar as it can be traced back to FitzRoy’s meticulous habits of note-taking and log-writing, which Darwin observed and emulated while aboard the Beagle and, hence, can be shown to have immediate and intimate connections with British imperial naval protocol, is something to which I will return.17 For the moment, I would like to consider another passage from the Autobiography, one focused on a memory that stands out in high relief: the memory of Darwin’s first contact with what he elsewhere calls ‘‘an untamed savage.’’18 Near the end of a section titled ‘‘Voyage of the ‘Beagle’: from Dec. 27, 1831 to Oct. 2, 1836,’’ Darwin singles out the three most memorable aspects of that voyage. Pride of place goes to ‘‘the glories of the vegetation of the Tropics’’; listed first, those glories also ‘‘rise before [his] mind at the present timemore vividly than anything else.’’ Next, anticipating Hud- son and preparing the way for his remembrances there, come ‘‘the great deserts of Patagonia,’’ a sublime landscape that ‘‘has left an indelible impression on [Dar- win’s] mind.’’ Third and last in this inventory of those things that a hazy memory has no trouble recollecting with clarity are savages: ‘‘The sight of a naked savage in his native land,’’ Darwin writes, ‘‘is an event which can never be forgotten.’’19 Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 59 </page> <page sequence="6"> Although he leaves the specifics to be inferred, the reference is certainly to a Fuegian, one of those inhabitants of the southernmost tip of South America that he first encountered when theBeaglemade landfall inTierra del Fuego inDecember of 1832. Featuring in the Autobiography as one of the episodes of the Beagle’s journey that remains sharpest in his recollection when he sits down to write a retrospective ac- count of his life, the encounter with Fuegians makes its initial public appearance in Darwin’s work forty years earlier, in the text that in later editions would come to be known asThe Voyage of the Beagle: the Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the Various Countries Visited by H.M. S. Beagle, Darwin’s contribution to the four-volume Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty’s Ships Adventure and Beagle (1839). Like the passage from the Autobiography from which I have just quoted the ‘‘retrospect’’ at the end of the Journal of Researches includes a catalog of those scenes and things ‘‘deeply impressed on [Darwin’s] mind’’ over the course of the journey. Prominent among them, as in the Autobiography, is to be found the following: ‘‘Of individual objects, perhaps no one ismore certain to create astonish- ment than the first sight in his native haunt of a real barbarian, of man in his lowest and most savage state.’’20 Astonishing at first sight and unforgettable ever after, Fuegian savages or barbarians obviate the need for abstracts, indices, or extensive notes of any sort.21 Fuegians make an indelible impression; they memorialize themselves. The reasons for this memorability are not far to seek. In the chapter of the Journal of Researches in which Darwin narrates his first sight of Fuegians, he claims that ‘‘it was without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle [he] had ever beheld’’ ( J, 178).22 ‘‘Curious’’ and ‘‘interesting’’ seem to assimilate Fuegians to other natural-historical wonders on offer in South America (parrots, volcanoes, the fossilized remains of giant sloths), a connection immediately borne out by the word ‘‘spectacle.’’ But the passage quickly leaves such intimations of gentlemanly spectatorship and cabinets of wonder behind, replacing them with the admission of a shock nothing less than categorical in its intensity. Fuegians figure not simply as curious and interesting spectacles but as barely human, preternatural, alien: ‘‘Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe they are fellow-creatures, and inhabitants of the same world’’ ( J, 184). Naked or nearly so despite inhabiting a land constantly subject to brutal storms and freezing temperatures, using few tools and poorly made boats, rumored to practice cannibalism (and in particular to con- sume elderly women in times of famine), without identifiable leaders, apparently without even basic social organization—Fuegians for Darwin incarnate the nadir of existence. They lack not only the accomplishments of other humans but also that joy in life occasionally evinced by such nonhuman animals as birds and even ants. ‘‘These were the most abject and miserable creatures,’’ he announces, ‘‘I any where beheld,’’ and in a footnote to that statement ventures the judgment that ‘‘in this extreme part of South America, man exists in a lower state of improvement than 60 R     </page> <page sequence="7"> in any other part of the world’’ ( J, 184, 184 n).23 The appearance of such debased misery, disturbing in itself, is still more so in that it shows every sign of immunity to change—is essentially ossified, fossilized. In the revised version of his narrative of theBeagle journey, published in 1845,Darwin writes that what little skill Fuegians possess ‘‘may be compared to the instinct of animals’’ because ‘‘it is not improved by experience: the canoe, their most ingenious work, poor as it is, has remained the same, as we know from Drake, for the last two hundred and fifty years.’’24 With no past such as Darwin has—their canoes remain as ineptly constructed as ever, whereas the mention of Sir Francis Drake alludes to a world that Darwin is both heir to and confident of having moved beyond—Fuegians fail even in the ability to imagine a time or place beyond the one they inhabit, a failing troped in Darwin’s account by their inability to conceive of a hereafter: ‘‘Captain Fitz Roy could never ascertain that the Fuegians have any distinct belief in a future life’’ ( J, 215). Abject, miserable, lacking a sense of history, incapable of progress and so shut out from futurity, unable to envision even the consolations of a life beyond death— as if all this were not enough, Fuegians are finally and, indeed, primarilymemorable for Darwin because they are themselves instigations to memory, living mnemonic devices. So much, at any rate, is conveyed by the full passage in the ‘‘retrospect’’ at the end of the Journal of Researches from which I have already excerpted passages: Of individual objects, perhaps no one is more certain to create astonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a real barbarian, of man in his lowest and most savage state. One’s mind hurries back over past centuries, and then asks, could our progenitors have been men such as these? Men, whose very signs and expressions are less intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals; men, who do not possess the instinct of those animals, nor yet appear to boast of human reason, or at least of arts consequent on that reason. ( J, 474) This excursus occurs amid a careful weighing of ‘‘the advantages and disadvan- tages, the pains and pleasures’’ of a circumnavigation of the globe ( J, 471). The account of pains, such as lack of privacy, loss of contact with friends, and perpetual seasickness, is set in the balance against the myriad pleasures involved in seeing tropical scenery and visiting a variety of foreign lands, gazing down at coral reefs and up at the constellations of the southern hemisphere. But this deliberate and symmetrical calibration of good and bad is brought up short when the list passes from scenery to human inhabitants in general and Fuegians in particular. Aston- ishing rather than advantageous or disadvantageous, painful or pleasurable, Fuegi- ans disrupt the organizational structure of the passage in which they appear, refus- ing to take their place in the litany. Such disruption, signaled by, among other things, the odd play of interrogation and declaration (the initial question seems to answer itself but is immediately followed by an answer that resembles still another question), is due to the fact that the memory of the first encounter with ‘‘man in his lowest and most savage state’’ is tied to and in some sense about a memory of another sort: ‘‘One’s mind hurries back over past centuries, and then asks, could Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 61 </page> <page sequence="8"> our progenitors have beenmen like these?’’ Fuegians, that is, disturb insofar as they give rise to something akin to racial memory in the observer.25 Seeing them causes Darwin to indulge in the quintessentially Victorian speculation that he might be face to face, if not literally with his own ancestors, at least with people very like them.26 And the thought is not a happy one, for even ‘‘domesticated animals’’ ap- pear preferable to these inexplicable and backward creatures, hideous skeletons in the familial closet. It is, however, haunting: Darwin would never forget it. II Like and unlike, near yet far, still alive and well but also outmoded and destined to disappear: such is the familiar stuff of the Victorian imaginary when it comes to savages. In Victorian Anthropology, George Stocking identifies these seem- ingly contradictory assumptions as fundamental to the comparativemethod, which is to say ‘‘the idea that in the absence of traditional historical evidence, the earlier phases of civilization could be reconstructed by using data derived from the obser- vation of peoples still living in earlier ‘stages’ of development.’’27 What makes Dar- win’s account different from and more interesting than most incarnations of this comparatism is, first, that his encounter with Fuegians takes up such a privileged place in the memory of his own early life and, second, that Fuegians and the ‘‘sav- ages’’ for whom they stand end up as both precisely what he must remember and what he needs to attempt to forget in order to defend the theory of evolution by natural selection and then apply that theory to humans. Darwin had, of course, been in contact with Fuegians before his arrival in Tierra del Fuego, simply not, to use his own language, ‘‘untamed’’ ones. Three Fuegians were aboard the Beagle on its 27 December 1831 departure from Dev- onport: twomen, YorkMinster and JemmyButton, and onewoman, Fuegia Basket. The three had been captured (or, in the case of Jemmy Button, purchased—his name commemorating his price) and taken to England during an earlier voyage of the Beagle and its sister ship the Adventure.28 Having been taught some English and instructed in Christianity as well as in such niceties as table manners and European dress—Jemmy Button’s dandyism was eventually lampooned in the British press— they were now to be returned to their homeland. Gillian Beer has argued that the time Darwin spent among these Anglicized Fuegians crucially shaped his response to the people he saw in South America late in 1832: ‘‘Darwin’s encounter with Fuegians in their native place gave him away of closing the gap between the human and other primates, a move necessary to the theories he was in the process of reach- ing. But it came after his experience of Fuegians abroad.’’29 Both sorts of Fuegian proved requisite to theorizing evolution. For to advance ‘‘savage’’ humans as part of the evidence for human descent from animals, Darwin required that Fuegians 62 R     </page> <page sequence="9"> be brutish and abject, and so plausibly close to animals, but also educable, and so like the rest of humanity. Something of this doubleness is made explicit in the Descent, where Darwin observes: ‘‘The Fuegians rank amongst the lowest barbarians; but I was continually struck with surprise how closely the three natives on board H.M. S. ‘Beagle,’ who had lived some years in England and could talk a little English, resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties’’ (D, 1:34). Eliding the distinction between ‘‘untamed’’ Fuegians and ‘‘the three natives’’ on the Beagle, Darwin here collapses the abject and the educable savage into a single collective entity—‘‘the Fuegians.’’ But his more frequent practice is to treat ‘‘untamed’’ Fuegians as repre- sentatives of savages generally and to distinguish Button, Basket, and Minster sharply from their less well-traveled kin. He observes in the Voyage of the Beagle, for instance, that ‘‘it was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages, when we landed, towards Jemmy Button.’’30 Such moments of distinction feature an incoherence or uncertainty that may usefully be clarified by contrast with other contemporaneous accounts of Fuegians. In the Proceedings of the First Expedition, 1826–1830, under the Command of Captain P. Parker King, the first volume of the Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M. S. Adven- ture and Beagle, Parker King notes of his own first sight of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego: they appeared to be a most miserable, squalid race, very inferior, in every respect, to the Patagonians. . . . [Their] seeming indifference, and total want of curiosity, gave us no favour- able opinion of their character as intellectual beings; indeed, they appeared to be very little removed from brutes; but our subsequent knowledge of them has convinced us that they are not usually deficient in intellect.31 Like Darwin, King makes sense of Fuegians by invoking a comparison: immedi- ately measuring Fuegians against Patagonians, King characterizes the former by finding them lacking, ‘‘inferior in every respect.’’ The effect of King’s comparatism, however, is quite different from that of Darwin’s, for King makes a place for Fuegi- ans, including rather than excluding them. Whereas Darwin’s surmise that Fuegi- ans resemble ‘‘our progenitors’’ contributes to establishing their uniqueness, their position as incarnations of ‘‘man in his lowest and most savage state,’’ marooned in the backwaters of time, King’s comparison of Fuegians to Patagonians connects them to other actually existing humans and, in so doing, acknowledges their inhab- itation of a present to which King himself also belongs. Moreover, King concludes with themention of a later and different estimation, one that marks his first opinion as erroneous: ‘‘but our subsequent knowledge of them has convinced us that they are not usually deficient in intellect.’’ At the beginning of the Proceedings of the Second Expedition, FitzRoy, describing his own response, revises King’s initial judgment of Fuegians still further: Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 63 </page> <page sequence="10"> During the time which elapsed before we reached England, I had time to see much of my Fuegian companions; and daily became more interested about them as I attained a further acquaintance with their abilities and natural inclinations. Far, very far indeed, were three of the number from deserving to be called savages—even at this early period of their residence among civilized people—though the other, namedYorkMinster, was certainly a displeasing specimen of uncivilized human nature.32 Especially notable is the explicit rejection of the applicability of the term ‘‘savage’’ to Fuegians, a rejection FitzRoy accounts for not by invoking whatever bits and pieces of English culture were forced on them during their time in England but rather by putting into evidence ‘‘their abilities and natural inclinations.’’ The close contact allowed by the Fuegians’ presence on the voyage back to England after their capture both elicits interest and gives the lie to a rush to judgment that would find in them confirmations of preconceived notions about savagery. Even the final refer- ence to YorkMinster, although pointedly characterizing him as ‘‘a displeasing spec- imen of uncivilized human nature,’’ achieves that characterization by individualiz- ing him and thus the others as well. Addressing FitzRoy’s and Darwin’s divergent reactions to Fuegians, Nigel Leask contrasts the former’s ‘‘Christian anthropology’’ with the latter’s ‘‘darker, more deterministic reading of bio-geographical pressure.’’33 Committed to the mo- nogenist position that all humans derived from the same aboriginal stock, FitzRoy approached Fuegians as a paternalist and philanthropist: for him they were improv- able, endowed with the potential to be Christianized and civilized. Such a view may have produced results both farcical and tragic, as the subsequent history of the three prodigal Fuegians demonstrates, but at base it presumed that savages shared essential ‘‘abilities and natural inclinations’’ with ‘‘civilized’’ humans.34 For Fitz- Roy, even YorkMinster possessed a ‘‘human nature,’’ however ‘‘uncivilized.’’ At the moment of his arrival in Tierra del Fuego, despite his reaction to Fuegians as if to aliens or demons,Darwin shared FitzRoy’s Christianmonogenism.35 Subsequently, Darwinian theory would play a key role in the biologization of race that Nancy Stepan and George Stocking have shown constitutes the dominant contribution of nineteenth-century biological and anthropological conjecture on the meaning of human difference.36 But in connection with Darwin this tells only half the story— or, rather, tells the story as if its grounds were not in the process of being shifted. It also neglects those moments when Darwin himself reads the savage peoples he encounters in the way that King and FitzRoy read them: as no different in es- sence from the civilized; as, in FitzRoy’s words, ‘‘ignorant, though rather intelli- gent barbarians.’’37 Predictably enough, given the history of European fascination with them, on the Beagle voyage it is Tahitians who seemmost promising to Darwin in this regard. Of his visit to Tahiti he writes in the Journal of Researches: ‘‘I was pleased with noth- ing so much as with the inhabitants. . . . There is a mildness in the expression of 64 R     </page> <page sequence="11"> their countenances, which at once banishes the idea of a savage; and an intelligence, which shows they are advancing in civilization’’ (J, 376–77). Other native peoples encountered include Auracanians in southern Chile, Australian aborigines, and Maoris of New Zealand. But memorable above all others are Fuegians, in whom Darwin finds no ‘‘mildness’’ and scant signs of ‘‘intelligence.’’ Indeed, his obsessive recourse to the moment of his landfall in Tierra del Fuego evidences little but the ‘‘negative’’ half of what Marianna Torgovnick, in Gone Primitive, calls the modern West’s ‘‘cherished series of dichotomies’’ about savages. InWestern representations, she points out, savages are ‘‘by turns gentle, in tune with nature, paradisal, ideal— or violent, in need of control; what we should emulate or, alternately, what we should fear; noble . . . or cannibals.’’38 Astonished to the point of horror on first viewing Fuegians, incapable of forgetting them ever after, Darwin’s repeated references to Fuegians attempt to place distance between their barbarity and himself, his (sym- pathetic) readers, and his work—even as those references serve as indispensable evidence of evolution. The ne plus ultra of savagery, so significant for and troubling to Darwin are Fuegians, that he invokes them in the concluding pages of the two central texts of evolutionary theory, On the Origin of Species and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. III In the Origin, Darwin scrupulously avoids speculation on the applicabil- ity of the theory of evolution to humans. The subject is touched on near the end of the text, and then only in a single coy sentence concerning the future of evolution- ary thought: ‘‘Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.’’39 Con- cerned to establish the evolution by natural selection of plants and (nonhuman) animals, he prosecutes his argument with painstaking attention to the geographical distribution, rudimentary organs, color patterns, nesting habits, and so forth of pi- geons, cats, ants, ostriches, geese, bees, beetles—an entire menagerie. Savages show up rarely, and then almost exclusively in connection with animals. Australian abo- rigines are mentioned, for instance, with an eye toward the dogs they keep and the livestock they do not (O, 215). In the ‘‘Conclusion,’’ however, which recapitulates the book’s ‘‘one long argument’’ (O, 459) and then speculates on some of its conse- quences, savages qua savages put in a brief and singular appearance as those beings who epitomize the attitude to nature that must be rejected if evolution is to be understood and appreciated: When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the sum- ming up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 65 </page> <page sequence="12"> we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become! (O, 485–86) The reference, again unspecified, is once again to Fuegians, about whom Darwin writes in the Journal of Researches that ‘‘simple circumstances . . . excited their admi- ration farmore than any grand or complicated object, such as the ship. Bougainville has remarked concerning these very people that they treat the ‘chef d’oeuvres de l’industrie humaine, comme ils traitent les loix de la nature et ses phe ́nome`nes’ ’’ (masterworks of human industry as they treat the laws of nature and its phenomena; ( J, 189). If the citation of Bougainville suggests that Fuegians fail to comprehend the status of HMS Beagle as built rather than created, the product of human artifice rather than divine fiat, the ‘‘Conclusion’’ to the Origin explains this lack of compre- hension as resulting specifically from an inability to see a ship as something ‘‘which has had a history,’’ which is to say something with a meaningful and recoverable past. Conceiving of Fuegians as part of his past rather than possessed of their own, Darwin enlists what he imagines to be their blank indifference to the historicity of ‘‘grand or complicated’’ objects in the service of promulgating his conclusions about the past of all life. Further, Darwin attributes a similar indifference to his opponents, those benighted anti-evolutionists who mistakenly ‘‘look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship.’’40 In the context of the paragraph as a whole, the simile achieves a complicated pertinence. The reference to what might be called a savage way of looking enables a specific critique: so synonymous with amnesia and impercipience has the notion of the savage become that it can be employed figura- tively to lambaste anyonewhowould deny theworkings of natural selection or claim that evolutionary theory drains the biological world of mystery or interest. But the very terms of the critique demand, of course, that reasonable readers not be savages, that they refuse the savage in themselves. This delicate exchange, in which savages must be remembered in order for savage ways to be abandoned or forgotten, is repeated and intensified in that later and, if possible, still more controversial text, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. Having throughout the Origin left the question of human evolution to one side, Darwin in theDescent sets out directly to demonstrate ‘‘that man is descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in its habits’’ (D, 2:389). In this text, that is, Darwin brings his great retrospective the- ory—which, in its refusal to view the natural world as a savage views a ship, invents or discovers a past for and a memory of life on the planet—to bear on himself and his readers. The effort demands particular attention to the early stages of human existence, and, according to the dictates of the comparative method, those stages are illuminated with myriad references to savages. A wide variety of remarks about their characteristics and habits litters the text, as indicated by index entries ranging from ‘‘Bushwoman, extravagant ornamentation of a’’ (D, 2:417) and ‘‘Malays, aver- 66 R     </page> <page sequence="13"> sion of some, to hairs on the face’’ (D, 2:445) to ‘‘Australians, colour of newborn children of ’’ (D, 2:409–10) and ‘‘Fuegians, resistance of the, to their severe climate’’ (D, 2:430). What such entries fail to indicate is the absolute centrality of savages to Darwin’s aims in the Descent, aims that he enumerates in the ‘‘Introduction’’ as follows: ‘‘to consider, firstly, whether man, like every other species, is descended from some pre-existing form; secondly, themanner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the differences between the so-called races of man’’ (D, 1:2–3). In their role as stand-ins for prehistoric forms of human life, savages and their ways provide key evidence for the solution to each of these three puzzles. It is not, however, until the very end of the final chapter of this mammoth text, in a retrospect titled ‘‘General Summary and Conclusion,’’ that Darwin returns again to the memory of his own initial experience of savages. The penultimate paragraph of the Descent begins as follows: The main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely that man is descended from some lowly-organised form, will, I regret to think, be highly distasteful to many persons. But there can hardly be a doubt that we are descended from barbarians. The astonishment which I felt upon first seeing a party of Fuegians on a wild and broken shore will never be forgotten by me, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind—such were our ances- tors. . . . He who has seen a savage in his native land will not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more humble creature flows in his veins. (D, 2:404) At last the link between the memorability of savages and their status as representa- tive of an earlier incarnation of humanity becomes explicit. The ‘‘for’’ in this pas- sage carries causal force: the encounter with Fuegians remains permanently lodged in Darwin’s memory because of the realization that ‘‘such were our ancestors.’’ At once impossibly different from Darwin and uncomfortably close to him, Fuegians constitute a nightmarish double—as the term ‘‘reflection’’ suggests: a thought or idea, ‘‘reflection’’ can also, of course, refer to the image reproduced by a polished surface.41 Both uses carry the root sense of turning back (Latin: re-, back or again; flectere, to bend), as does the meaning, once possible but most likely obsolete by the 1870s, ‘‘the recollection or remembrance of a thing.’’42 Recoiling from his own im- age as if from a distorting mirror, Darwin reflects upon (returns to, considers, re- members) his ancestors—and the reflection (thought, image, memory) horrifies. This horror, though, can be put to use. In the rhetoric at play in this passage, Dar- win calls upon Fuegians in order to ease acceptance of the notion of descent from animals. Once Darwin’s readers accede to the unpleasant but apparently self- evident fact that they are descended from savages, that is, they should find it less difficult, indeed in some sense a consolation, to admit that even further back in time their ancestors were still more ‘‘lowly-organised’’ forms.43 Still unforgettable, then, savages in the Descent return at first as that which makes the kinship between humans and animals more palatable. In the course of the paragraph, however, an odd shift occurs whereby Fuegians and Darwin’s mem- Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 67 </page> <page sequence="14"> ory of his encounter with them move from what enables acceptance of human de- scent from animals to what must be refused and replaced by that descent. ‘‘For my own part,’’ Darwin writes, I would as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey, who braved his dreaded enemy in order to save the life of his keeper; or from that old baboon, who, descending from the mountains, carried away in triumph his young comrade from a crowd of astonished dogs— as from a savage who delights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practises infanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no decency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions. (D, 2:404–5) Here Darwin asks readers to exercise their own faculties of memory in recalling an earlier moment in the Descent: the heroic monkey and loyal baboon alluded to are discussed in ‘‘Comparison of the Mental Powers of Man and the Lower Ani- mals,’’ the second and third chapters of the work’s first volume, the burden of which is to lessen the perceived distance between human and nonhuman with a barrage of anecdotes about animals’ courage, affection, sociability, aesthetic sensibilities, capacity for reflection, and, not surprisingly, memory (D, 1:34–106).44 At the end of the Descent, Darwin recurs to these anthropomorphized creatures in order to push civilized and savage humans further apart by grouping the former with ani- mals against the latter, who now stand outside of any community whatsoever. Be- lying the equivalence between animal and savage initiallymooted (‘‘I would as soon be descended from . . . ’’) and carrying an affective charge far in excess of the re- quirements of the analogical argument being prosecuted, the mention of savages and the demonization of savage behavior memorialize a deep antipathy to the thought of a kinship of which, however, ‘‘there can hardly be a doubt.’’ IV Half a century after Darwin’s encounter with Fuegians, when W.H. Hudson writes about his own travels in the southern cone of South America, he does so with Darwin constantly in mind. It might even be said that Darwin is to Hudson as Fuegians are to Darwin insofar as Hudson cannot help but recall Dar- win at crucial moments but also repeatedly refuses connection with him. Such re- fusal begins on his title page itself, which announces the intention to document not the (heroic, active, Odyssean) Voyage of the Beagle but instead Idle Days in Patagonia. Hudson is more like than unlike the author of the narrative of the Beagle’s voyage, though, insofar as a concern with memory suffuses his text as well, coloring the whole—or scenting it, it might be better to say, since the olfactory preoccupiesHud- son much more than does the visual. The final chapter of Idle Days in Patagonia, ‘‘The Perfume of an Evening Primrose,’’ conducts a nearly Proustian investigation of that titular perfume, its evocation of various pivotal events in Hudson’s life, and the more general claim that among the senses it is smell that can best ‘‘restore the 68 R     </page> <page sequence="15"> past’’ because, unlike sights and sounds, scents ‘‘cannot . . . be reproduced in the mind’’—cannot, that is, deliberately be remembered.45 Despite the emphasis here on the particular ability of scents to effect such time traveling, a similar restoration of days gone by occurs elsewhere in the text as a result of landscape. As we have seen, the plains of Patagonia function in much the same way as the perfume of the evening primrose, providing a mnemonic device so powerful that it obliterates the present, replacing it not with the personal past of a lost childhood but with the collective past of ‘‘the emotional state of the pure savage.’’ In connection with Darwin and Fuegians, the key point about Hudson’s rever- sion to savagery is neither its mere occurrence nor the particular stimulus that insti- gates it but rather the response to which it gives rise: ‘‘the feeling experienced on going back to a mental condition we have outgrown, which I had in the Patagonian solitude,’’ Hudson announces, is nothing other than ‘‘elation.’’46 Traveling back- wards in time so as to retrace and, in so doing, reverse the path of human evolution, Hudson arrives at what he takes to be the stark clarity and alertness of the savage mind with excitement, welcome, relief—the emotions of homecoming. The re- sponse is hardly unprecedented, for, as Torgovnick notes, ‘‘The metaphor of finding a home or being at home recurs over and over [in] Western primitivism. Going primitive is trying to ‘go home’ to a place that feels comfortable and balanced, where full acceptance comes freely and easily.’’47 Such yearning for a lost sense of belong- ing both structures and is rendered curiously obsolete by Idle Days in Patagonia, a text in which the chasm separating past from present, primitive from civilized, is at once insisted on and effortlessly bridged over. If such a chasm amounts to thou- sands or tens of thousands of years, that apparently insuperable temporal distance becomes inconsequential on the plains of Patagonia, disappearing to reveal the joy- ful truth that ‘‘in our inmost natures, our deepest feelings, we are still one with the savage.’’48 Hudson provides an especially intense but nonetheless exemplary instance of the romanticization of savage life and savage states of being—the welcoming em- brace of the savage that stands counter to Darwin’s fear and loathing. At the same time, despite his differences from Darwin, Hudson helps elucidate the double and contradictory place of the savage in Darwin’s work. For if, as Darwin writes at the end of theDescent, ‘‘there can hardly be a doubt that we are descended frombarbari- ans,’’ the likelihood that, as Hudson puts it in Idle Days in Patagonia, ‘‘we are still one with the savage’’ renders such indubitable knowledge insupportable. Incapable of exorcising the memory of his own encounter with Fuegian savages and, further, compelled by the exigencies of his argument to invoke that encounter to demon- strate the workings of evolution (and human evolution in particular), Darwin de- nies the savage in order to render the consequences of those workings tolerable. Certain of his kinship with savages, he nevertheless betrays a wish that he did not have to remember it. Hudson appears to reveal the motivation behind that wish as fear of atavism, of a literal return to savagery, and Darwin’s corpus amply attests Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 69 </page> <page sequence="16"> to such a fear. If we look back at the Autobiography, for instance, we find a passage explaining how, during the first two years of the Beagle’s voyage, Darwin gradually turned over responsibility for shooting specimens to his servant so that he might spend all his time cataloging and geologizing, a passage that Darwin concludes with the observation about himself that ‘‘the primeval instincts of the barbarian slowly yielded to the acquired tastes of the civilized man.’’49 Separated by only a paragraph from the account of the unforgettables of the Beagle voyage, and so from the mention of ‘‘the sight of a naked savage in his native land,’’ the confident pro- gressivism of this sentence remains vulnerable to reversal, to the slow yielding (or, as in Hudson, instantaneous reversion) of acquired tastes to primeval instincts, of the civilized man to the barbarian. Darwin might be said actually to have undergone such an atavistic reversal, and to have done so by way of the very forgetfulness he summons up to ward off that possibility. For among the various elements that constitute humanity for Darwin is, above all, the capacity to reflect on past actions and events, a capacity wholly depen- dent on the faculty of memory. Only in and through their employment of memory and reflection do humans as such, as ethical beings able to evaluate and alter their own behavior, exist.50 Hence the significance of Darwin’s repeated claims that non- human animals, too, have the ability to remember and reflect: if we are descended from them, they must possess, if only partially or incipiently, even those ‘‘higher’’ capacities (in this case, an ethical sense and the powers of recollection on which it depends) that set us apart from them.51 And so, again in the chapters of the Descent in which he undertakes a ‘‘Comparison of theMental Powers ofMan and the Lower Animals,’’ Darwin poses the following patently rhetorical question: But can we feel sure that an old dog with an excellent memory and some power of imagina- tion, as shewn by his dreams, never reflects on his past pleasures in the chase? and this would be a form of self-consciousness. On the other hand . . . how little can the hard-worked wife of a degraded Australian savage, who uses hardly any abstract words and cannot count above four, exert her self-consciousness, or reflect on the nature of her own existence. (D, I:62) What distinguishes savages from the civilized, and apparently even from ‘‘an old dog with an excellent memory and some power of imagination,’’ is their inability to reflect, itself rooted in an inability to remember.52 Fuegians display such an in- ability—as, in a different register, do the savage Britons who would oppose the the- ory of evolution. In incessantly recalling Fuegians and his encounter with them, then, Darwin enacts his own civilized humanity. As for so many other Victorian narrators, his engagement in retrospection makes him who he is. Looking back, he pieces together a story of origins and development that, because of its totalizing ambitions and the scope of its influence, becomes for a time the story of develop- ment, the privileged account by which nineteenth-century Europeans understood 70 R     </page> <page sequence="17"> themselves and how they came to be. Troubling that account, though, is the danger of a constitutive forgetting that, even as it works to distance past from present, sav- age from civilized, threatens to instill savagery in the modern. In wishing to ward off as much as to recall his proximity to Fuegians, that is, Darwin leaves open the possibility of succumbing to the very amnesia and incomprehension he condemns. Paradoxically desiring to look at savages in the way he claims savages look at ships and anti-evolutionists look at the natural world, Darwin risks becoming that most civilized of beings, the modern primitive. Despite the gestures of avoidance that run from the Journal of Researches (‘‘Could our progenitors have been men such as these?’’; J, 474) to the Descent (‘‘I would as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey’’; D, 2:404), however, Darwin never comes close to forgetting Fuegians. For how could he? His entire project de- mands that he remember—and that we remember with him—what he may not wish to and in a literal sense ( pace Hudson) cannot: the history of life as an unfath- omably long series of imperceptibly minute changes in millions of generations of millions of species of biological beings, including those human ancestors for whom, forDarwin and other practitioners of the comparativemethod, nineteenth-century savages stand. Thus, to return to and reinflect a notion advanced earlier in this essay, Darwin’s corpus may not resemble ‘‘one long argument’’ so much as one immense prosthetic memory. In the Principles of Geology, Lyell likens the geological record to a book in which, despite various missing pages, the earth’s past can be discerned.53 Darwin himself borrows and extends the analogy. ‘‘For my part,’’ he writes, ‘‘following out Lyell’s metaphor, I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a few lines’’ (O, 310–11). But Darwin’s textual production taken as a whole requires that the metaphor be reversed: geological strata (re)con- structed in and as language, like those strata it remembers for us what we are inca- pable of remembering ourselves. The imperative to remember characterizes Darwin’s work in another way as well, one that will return us for the last time to Darwin’s persistent and persistently resisted memories of Fuegians. The subtitle of the Origin defines evolution by natu- ral selection as ‘‘The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life,’’ and it is this view of nature as an arena of perpetual conflict that, for better and worse, has come to be indissolubly associated with Darwinism. For Darwin himself, how- ever, accepting evolution as a valid account of biological change always demanded a different struggle, the struggle against forgetting: We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these song- Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 71 </page> <page sequence="18"> sters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year. (O, 62) ‘‘We forget . . . we forget . . . we do not always bear in mind’’: without the necessary corrective of memory, immediate impressions of the natural world ‘‘bright with gladness’’ inevitably deceive. Beer beautifully limns this aspect of Darwin’s percep- tion of nature when she writes that ‘‘Darwin lives in a doubly profuse world—the plenitude of present life, its potential for both development and death, and the re- cessional and forgotten multitudes which form the ground of the present.’’54 Thus the justly celebrated ‘‘entangled bank’’ paragraph that concludes theOrigin, so often invoked as emblematic of Darwinian nature, provides at best a partial account. What is seen in that paragraph—‘‘elaborately constructed forms’’ that include ‘‘plants of many kinds,’’ ‘‘birds singing on the bushes,’’ ‘‘various insects flitting about,’’ and ‘‘worms crawling through the dark earth’’—can be comprehended only in relation to what is not—what is absent and somust be remembered (O, 489). The Journal of Researches, the Origin, the Descent, the Autobiography: each insists that there can be no understanding without recollection, no discovery without memory. More particularly, each aspires to serve as a reminder (as the passage just quoted serves as a reminder) of that which is easiest to forget but also, if evolution bymeans of natural selection is to be grasped, essential to recall: the ubiquity of conflict, loss, death. As Adam Phillips puts it in Darwin’s Worms: ‘‘One is, Darwin suggests . . . , more likely to forget what is disagreeable to oneself, but what is most disagreeable may be of most value.’’55 Phillips’s formulation, precisely accurate with regard to the place of starvation, predation, and extinction in Darwin’s corpus, strangely fails when it comes to Fuegians. Undoubtedly ‘‘disagreeable’’ and arguably of ‘‘most value’’ in thinking about humans and their origins, Fuegians are not simply unlikely to be forgotten by Darwin but actually impossible for him to forget. They thus constitute an excep- tion to or a short-circuit in the work of memory demanded by evolutionary theory. To explain why this should be so, let me advance once more a claim made near the end of the third section of this essay: namely, that Darwin anthropomorphizes nonhuman animals in order to group themwith civilized humanity against savages, who are thus effectively exiled, left without a place in the web of life. (Recall the Journal of Researches: ‘‘Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe they are fellow-creatures, and inhabitants of the same world’’; J, 184.) Such exile, I have argued, constitutes a refusal of the proximity of the savage to the civilized that is at once necessary and unbearable. But there is another, equally compelling and, I think, more suggestive way to conceptualize the displacement of the savage, one that has to do with the fate of the ‘‘human’’ under evolution. In the wake of Darwinism, the distinction humans make between themselves and other animals must be seen as essentially arbitrary. Like ‘‘species’’ in the Origin 72 R     </page> <page sequence="19"> (‘‘Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub-species . . . or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties’’; O, 51), ‘‘human’’ after the Descent becomes a term of convenience, a name for a differ- ence that may not actually exist.56 As evidentiary and rhetorical constructs, Fuegi- ans function to render this insight possible. Darwin’s repeated references to and incessant memories of them as inhuman or as occupying the borderland between human and inhuman enable the postulation of a continuum running from themost ‘‘lowly-organized form[s]’’ of animal existence to civilized humanity—a contin- uum that can be put in motion and read as a time line that tells the story of life. Necessarily a point on that continuum, Fuegians are also exiled from it. Neither human nor ‘‘animal,’’ too familiar to be ignored but too alien to be acknowledged kin (and, as Ian Duncan argues, vice versa), they stand alone.57 Because of this very isolation, however, Fuegians remain as a kind of last possibility for human exceptionalism in evolutionary theory. At amoment when other humans have been completely assimilated to the natural world, when the line between human and inhuman has been revealed to be a consolatory fiction, Fuegians preserve human separateness. Whence their place—and the place of savages more generally—in the play of memory and forgetting requisite to theorizing evolution: if understand- ing natural selection requires a struggle against forgetting what is disagreeable, the involuntary memory of Fuegians serves to forestall one of the most disagreeable consequences of evolution, the loss of human distinctness. As attested by the joyful embrace of the savage within evinced by Hudson and so many others since, Dar- win’s memory of ‘‘savages’’ on a wild and desolate shore should be understood as, among other things, a memory of the last fully human beings on earth. No t e s Research for this essay was undertaken with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities; the Newberry Library, Chicago; and the Josiah Charles Trent Me- morial Foundation. I am grateful to those institutions, as well as to trenchant (not to say savage) and unfailingly generous readers of earlier drafts, including Ian Baucom, Ian Duncan, Jared Gardner, Beth Hewitt, AndrewMiller, Dana Seitler, and the edito- rial board of Representations. 1.

As this definition suggests, Fabian concerns himself specifically with anthropologists and the temporal differential they assume exists be- tween themselves and their objects of study. But in this regard anthropology shares an assumption widespread in nineteenth-century European thought about non-European peoples.

Darwin is somewhat unusual in treating the terms ‘‘savage’’ and ‘‘barbarian’’ as synon- ymous. More common is John Stuart Mill’s usage in an 1836 essay, ‘‘Civilization,’’ where he asserts that civilization ‘‘stands for that kind of improvement only, which dis- tinguishes a wealthy and powerful nation from savages or barbarians’’—the ‘‘or’’ set- ting apart the two savage and barbarian types of people from each other as both are set apart from the civilized; John Stuart Mill, ‘‘Civilization’’ (1836), in Dissertations and Discussions, Political, Philosophical, and Historical, 3rd ed. (London, 1875), 1:160. Mill employs a tripartite division common as far back as the Greeks. Relatively new, how- ever, is his proto-evolutionary sense of savages, barbarians, and civilized peoples in- habiting different points on a developmental time line; Stocking, Victorian Anthropology, 8–14. The distinction as it appears in Mill, which was only strengthened in the wake ofDarwinian evolutionary theory, continues active right through to the end of the nine- teenth century and beyond. Witness, for instance, this sentence from the first chapter of Thorstein Veblen’s The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899; reprint, New York, 1934): ‘‘At a step backward in the cultural scale [from ‘‘lower barbarian culture’’]—among savage groups—the differentiation of em- ployments is still less elaborate’’ (5–6). 22. Compare the account of first contact with Fuegians written on 18 December 1832 in the diary Darwin kept during the voyage of the Beagle: ‘‘It was without exception the most curious spectacle I ever beheld. I would not have believed how entire the difference between savage &amp; civilized man is. It is greater than between a wild &amp; domesticated animal, in as much as in man there is greater power of improvement. . . . I believe if the world was searched, no lower grade of man could be found’’; Diary of the Voyage of H.M. S. Beagle, vol. 1 ofWorks of Charles Darwin, 111. 23. In this estimate of Fuegians, Darwin follows tradition. When Captain James Cook landed in Tierra del Fuego in January of 1769 he found the inhabitants ‘‘perhaps as miserable a set of People as are this day upon Earth’’; Cook quoted in J. C. Beaglehole, The Life of Captain James Cook (Stanford, 1974), 161. As Gayatri Spivak has pointed out, Immanuel Kant in the Critique of Judgment invokes Fuegians (along with Australian aborigines) as the epitome of the not-quite or barely human: ‘‘We do not see why it is necessary that men should exist (a question which is not so easy to answer if we cast our thoughts by chance on theNewHollanders or the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego)’’; Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Van- ishing Present (Cambridge, Mass., 1999), 26. 24. Charles Darwin, The Voyage of the Beagle, rev. ed. (1845; reprint, New York, 1909), 231. 25. Walter BennMichaels notes that the ‘‘obvious objection’’ to the use of the term ‘‘mem- ory’’ in this way (that is, as a name for Darwin’s reflections upon his own ancestry set off by the sight of Fuegians) is that ‘‘things we are said to remember are things that we did or experienced whereas things that are said to have taken place in the historical past tend to be things that were neither done nor experienced by us’’; Walter Benn Michaels, ‘‘ ‘You who never was there’: Slavery and the New Historicism, Deconstruc- tion and the Holocaust,’’ Narrative 4 (1996): 4. The assertion that Fuegians cause Dar- win to remember having been a savage himself, then, depends upon a slippage inmean- 76 R     </page> <page sequence="23"> ing between the individual-biographical and the world-historical. In the notebooks he kept from 1836 to 1839, and particularly in the 1838 notebooks devoted to transmuta- tion and the biological basis of human and animal behavior, Darwin’s speculations on memory nearly all turn on such a slippage because it seemed to provide an explanation for instinct. Thus, in the so-calledMnotebook, written between July andOctober 1838, he observes: ‘‘Now ifmemory «of a tune&amp;words» can thus lie dormant, during awhole life time, quite unconsciously of it, surely memory from one generation to another, also without consciousness, as instincts are, is not so very wonderful’’; Charles Darwin’s Note- books, 1836–1844: Geology, Transmutation of Species, Metaphysical Enquiries, ed. Paul H. Barrett et al. (Ithaca, 1987), 521. Perhaps the most resonant formulation along these lines occurs in the C notebook, kept during the first half of 1838: ‘‘Analogy. a bird can swim without being web footed yet with much practice &amp; led on by circumstanc it be- comes web footed, now Man by effort of Memory can remember how to swim after having once learnt, &amp; if that was a regular contingency the brain would become web- footed &amp; there would be no act of memory’’; Charles Darwin’s Notebooks, 293. As Laura Otis demonstrates, Darwin would later move away from this literalization of the associ- ation of memory with inheritance, contesting it in the work of Ewald Hering and other theorists of ‘‘organic memory’’; Laura Otis, Organic Memory: History and the Body in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries (Lincoln, 1994). My interest in this essay is with Darwin’s insistent invocation of memory not as an actual mechanism of inheri- tance but as a trope he elaborates in connection with Fuegians, a trope that at once troubles him and provides him with the ability to negotiate relations among Fuegians, himself, and nineteenth-century Europeans generally. 26. For another account of the encounter between the crew of theBeagle and the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, see Michael Taussig’sMimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses (New York, 1993). Taussig views this encounter as a signal moment in the history of the contemporary West’s relation to ‘‘mimesis,’’ here understood as ‘‘the nature that culture uses to create second nature, the faculty to copy, imitate, make models, explore difference, yield into and become Other’’ (xiii).

In the Descent, Darwin states his faith in the com- parative method directly: ‘‘We are chiefly concerned with primeval times, and our only means of forming a judgment on this subject is to study the habits of existing semi- civilised and savage nations’’; Darwin, Descent, 2:338. See also the companion volume to the Descent, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, in which Darwin de- clares that ‘‘the essence of savagery seems to consist in the retention of a primordial condition’’; Charles Darwin, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (2nd ed. 1890), vol. 23 ofWorks of Charles Darwin, 179. 28. In connection with Jemmy Button, I should perhaps write ‘‘supposedly purchased.’’ According to Lucas Bridges, son of theReverendThomas Bridges (Anglicanmissionary at Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, and a correspondent of Darwin’s), this account is ‘‘ridicu- lous . . . as no native would have sold his child in exchange for H.M. S. Beagle with all it had on board’’; Lucas Bridges, Uttermost Part of the Earth (New York, 1949), 30.

Farce: Button, Minster, and Basket were to have formed the nucleus of a Christian mis- sion presided over by a catechist namedRichardMatthews, whom theBeagle left behind early in 1833; the plan collapsed almost immediately: when the Beagle returned a few weeks later to check on its progress, Matthews ‘‘ran towards the captain’s launch screaming with terror and refused to go ashore again’’; Browne, Charles Darwin: Voyag- ing, 252–53. Tragedy: on 6 November 1859, Jemmy Button was involved in the massa- cre of another group of missionaries to Tierra del Fuego, seven Britons and one Swede, at Wulaia Cove; Hazlewood, Savage, 209. 35. Darwin ‘‘had no foundation for believing that . . . native Fuegians were in some way closer to animals than he was.

Subsequent citations appear in the text following the abbreviation O. 40. Darwin employs a similar but more elaborately developed simile in the next-to-last paragraph ofThe Variation of Plants and Animals under Domestication: ‘‘If it were explained to a savage utterly ignorant of the art of building, how the edifice [a building con- structed from ‘‘fragments at the base of a precipice’’] had been raised stone upon stone, and why wedge-formed fragments were used for the arches, flat stones for the roof, etc.; and if the use of each part and of the whole building were pointed out, it would be unreasonable if he declared that nothing had been made clear to him, because the precise cause of the shape of each fragment could not be told. But this is a nearly parallel case with the objection that selection explains nothing, because we know not the cause of each individual difference in the structure of each being’’; The Variation of Plants and Animals under Domestication (1868), vol. 20 ofWorks of Charles Darwin, 370–71. In his own comments on savages’ response to ‘‘grand or complicated object[s],’’ FitzRoy accounts for the astonishment of Fuegians viewing a steamship by likening it to the reaction of one of his English readers standing near a steam-powered locomotive for the first time; FitzRoy, Proceedings of the Second Expedition, 3. 41. Thus Gillian Beer on Darwin and Fuegians: ‘‘Darwin communicates a sense of fasci- nated helplessness at finding himself unable to interpret the profound difference of the other man. . . . Here no relation, in the sense of message or narrative, can be established. 78 R     </page> <page sequence="25"> The other is ‘inconceivably wild.’ But that which is inconceivable is also here a mirror- image’’; Beer, Open Fields, 25. 42. Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., s.v. ‘‘Reflection.’’ 43. Compare Darwin to Charles Kingsley, 6 Feb. 1862: ‘‘That is a grand &amp; almost awful question on the genealogy of man to which you allude. It is not so awful &amp; difficult to me, as it seems to be most, partly from familiarity and partly, I think, from having seen a good many Barbarians. I declare the thought, when I first saw in T. del Fuego a naked painted, shivering hideous savage, that my ancestors must have been somewhat similar beings, was at that time as revolting to me, nay more revolting than my present belief that an incomparably more remote ancestor was a hairy beast. Monkeys have down- right good hearts, at least sometimes, as I could show, if I had space’’; Burkhardt and Smith, Correspondence, 10:71. See also Neville Hoad, ‘‘Wild(e) Men and Savages: The Homosexual and the Primitive in Darwin, Wilde, and Freud’’ (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1998), 30–31. 44. See especially the paragraph that begins ‘‘It is almost superfluous to state that animals have excellent Memories for persons and places.’’ (D 1:45). Darwin’s commitment to establishing the fundamental similarity between the mental faculties of animals and humans persists right down to the final book he published during his lifetime, Charles Darwin, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits (1881; reprint, Chicago, 1985), half a chapter of which is devoted to demonstrating that ‘‘worms, although standing low in the scale of organization, possess some degree of intelligence’’ (98). As George Levine maintains, ‘‘anthropomorphism is not for Darwin a mere sentimental lapse. . . . It is rather a quite seriously worked out way of regarding a world in which there is an absolute continuity between humans and animals’’; George Levine, ‘‘ ‘And If It Be a PrettyWoman All the Better’—Darwin and Sexual Selection,’’ in Small and Tate, Literature, Science, Psychoanalysis, 49. Darwin’s insistence on the human capacities of animals necessitates a concomitant bestialization of humans, and of savages in particular; as John Durant pithily observes: ‘‘Thus was anthropomorphic zoology combined with zoomorphic anthropology in effecting the unification of animals and man, matter andmind, nature and morality’’; John Durant, ‘‘The Ascent of Nature in Darwin’s Descent of Man,’’ in The Darwinian Heritage, ed. Da- vid Kohn (Princeton, 1985), 292. 45. Hudson, Idle Days, 223, 226. 46. Ibid., 205. 47. Torgovnick, Gone Primitive, 185. 48. Hudson, Idle Days, 214. 49. Darwin, Autobiography, 79. Compare the following from Expression of the Emotions: ‘‘I remember once seeing a boy who had just shot his first snipe on the wing, and his hands trembled to such a degree from delight, that he could not for some time reload his gun; and I have heard of an exactly similar case with an Australian savage, to whom a gun had been lent’’ (51). In a footnote, Francis Darwin identifies the boy as Charles Darwin himself (51 n). 50. ‘‘A moral being is one who is capable of comparing his past and future actions or mo- tives, and of approving or disapproving of them’’; ‘‘Man, from the activity of his mental faculties, cannot avoid reflection: past impressions and images are incessantly passing through his mind with distinctness’’; Darwin, Descent, 1:88, 89. 51. As Robert J. Richards avers, in attributing reason to nonhuman animals, ‘‘Darwin really opened no new epistemological ground. . . . But [for pre-Darwinian thinkers] no animal . . . gave any hint of what was truly distinctive of human mind—namely, Darwin’s Savage Mnemonics 79 </page> <page sequence="26"> moral judgement. If Darwin were to solidify his case for the descent of man from lower animals, he would have to discover the roots of moral behaviour even among those creatures. And so he did’’; Robert J. Richards, ‘‘Darwin on Mind, Morals and Emo- tions,’’ inThe Cambridge Companion to Darwin, ed. JonathanHodge andGregory Radick (Cambridge, 2003), 95–96. 52. That ‘‘the hard-worked wife of a degraded Australian savage’’ stands as exemplary of savagery in this instance reveals the necessity for an additional analysis, one attentive to Darwin’s understanding of the ‘‘savage’’ inability to ‘‘exert . . . self-consciousness’’ as at least in part the result of a particular set of gendered social arrangements. In ‘‘Evolution, Domesticated,’’ a companion piece to this essay that I am now in the pro- cess of writing, I approach such an analysis by following the tortuous path of ‘‘domesti- cation’’ as it wends its way through Darwin’s corpus and considering the relation be- tween that path and the quite different one taken by ‘‘domestication’’ in the work of Alfred Russel Wallace. 53. Comparisons between the earth’s geology and a book either imperfectly preserved or difficult to interpret appear throughout; see, for instance, the opening of the third vol- ume: ‘‘As the first theorists possessed but scanty acquaintance with the present economy of the animate and inanimate world . . . we find them in the situation of novices, who attempt to read a history written in a foreign language’’; Lyell, Principles of Geology, 3:1. 54.
