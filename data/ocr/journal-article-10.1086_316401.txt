         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>Ever since the suggestion by
Hubble (1928) and
Mayall (1939) that the Chinese
Guest Star of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 could be interpreted as a supernova
associated with the Crab Nebula, there have been exhaustive searches to
find additional corroborating references in world literature. Efforts by
Ho et al. (1972), expanding on the
earlier work of Duyvendak (1942),
found references in both the Chinese and Japanese literature.
Brecher, Lieber, &amp; Lieber (1978)
describe an account of an Iraqi physician, Ibn Butlān, as recorded by
Abī Uşaybi’a in about <sc>a.d.</sc> 1242, connecting
the event to a plague in Egypt and Constantinople in <sc>a.d.</sc>
1054–1055, while Brandt &amp; Williamson
(1979) make an excellent case for the stellar explosion
being seen and recorded by Native North Americans. The absence of any
reference in the European literature has traditionally been something of a
mystery. Records of the supernova of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1006 and the
appearance of Halley’s comet in <sc>a.d.</sc> 1066 demonstrate that
astronomical phenomena were noticed and recorded by 11th century Europeans.
One of the traditional explanations for the absence of European references
as expressed by Williams (1981) is
that the weather was bad. However, since the supernova would have been
remarkably bright and visible for well over a year, that explanation seems
rather implausible. Thomas (1979)
and separately Zalcman (1979)
suggest that the absence is the result of some sort of censorship by the
Roman Catholic Church connected with the Eastern Schism, generally dated
to <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 16. This view was most recently echoed
by Lupato (1995),1
and Guidobani et al. (1992), who cite other examples of
such censorship during the 11th century.</p>
         <p>However, we suggest that there are indeed references in the
European literature of that time and that they serve to add to the
information concerning the appearance of the supernova.
Williams (1981) describes an
interesting reference in the Rampona Chronicles that was pointed out to him
by Newton (1972, pp.
445–446). Several references dealing with the death of
Pope Saint Leo IX are discussed by Guidoboni, di Marmo,
&amp; Polcaro (1992) and Breen &amp;
McCarthy (1995). McCarthy &amp;
Breen (1997) further discuss references in the Irish
annals that appear to refer to astronomical phenomena, possibly including
the supernova of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054. Finally, there is an Armenian
report discussed by Astapovich
(1974) that seems to refer to the supernova.</p>
         <p>The traditional approach concerning reports that might relate to
the supernova has been to decide which reference is the most definitive
and likely to be the most accurate. However, all of the references
available are derived from earlier sources and were written in their
present form centuries after the event. Therefore, it is not surprising
that inconsistencies occur between and often within specific reports. We
review these reports to see whether there is a series of astronomical
events that minimizes the apparent conflicts between them. In order to
understand the sources, it will be necessary to allow for the societal
constraints of the time and locale where they were originally recorded.
Mindful of the arguments of Guidoboni et
al. (1992), we should be careful of the
prejudices introduced by the translation of early documents into
contemporary language. We will find that some European sources are
metaphorical and occasionally anthropomorphic, in contrast to the oriental
sources, since the astronomical knowledge of the Dark Ages in Europe was
more primitive than in the East. However, we should remember that the level
of science in the Orient was far from what we would consider to be science
today. A primary motivation for heavenly observation was to search
for “signs” or omens, but these incorporated rather
accurate positional measurements. Indeed, as pointed out by
Ho et al. (1972), the Chinese did
not regard the stars as fixed. However, it is likely that they would
connect an occurrence at dusk with a similar occurrence in the dawn sky at
a later date. This is unlikely to be true in medieval Europe.</p>
         <p>We begin with the assumption that the supernova did indeed occur
in <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054, resulting in today’s well‐studied
Crab Nebula. This will enable us to incorporate astronomical constraints
in developing a sequence of events that will minimize the apparent
conflicts among the sources. For example, the Crab Nebula would have been
in conjunction with the Sun on or about <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 May 27. Thus,
had the supernova exploded prior to that date, it would have been invisible
for a period of time when it was close to the Sun. Recent advances in
almanacs for small computers make it possible to accurately describe the
sky as seen from any location on the Earth a millennium ago. We have used
the program REDSHIFT I (see Maris
1993) to reproduce the sky as seen from various locales
during the 11th century. Work by Upgren
(1991) and Schaefer
(1993) makes it possible to estimate the effect of the
dawn sky on the appearance of astronomical objects at the time of the
reported sightings. We begin by reviewing and interpreting a number of
European sources that suggest sightings of the supernova as an event in the
evening sky before conjunction with the Sun in late May of 1054. We then
briefly review reports from the East that are generally regarded as
definitive for establishing the Crab Nebula supernova as occurring in
<sc>a.d.</sc> 1054. It will be apparent that conditions of stellar
visibility in the dawn sky during the summer of 1054 cast doubt on the
traditional interpretation of the Chinese manuscripts. Finally, we will
apply astronomical constraints applicable to the Crab supernova in order to
establish a sequence of events that minimizes apparent conflicts between
various reports of the time.</p>

         <title>EUROPEAN REFERENCES</title>
         <p>Breen &amp; McCarthy
(1995) discuss several interesting possible European
references to the supernova collected by Guidoboni et
al. (1992). They cite three references to the death of
pope Leo IX, the most relevant of which is from the <italic>Tractus de
ecclesia S. Petri Aldenburgensi</italic>
(see Holder‐Egger 1888). The
third reference to <italic>De obitu Leonis</italic> by Libuinus, a subdeacon in
the Roman Church (see Watterich
1862, p. 176), describes
the soul of Leo being taken by angels up to heaven “as along a path
strewn with shining garments and lit by innumerable brilliant lamps.”
The second reference to <italic>Desiderii abbatis Casinesis …</italic>
also cited by Watterich (1862)
seems too metaphorical to be clearly connected to the supernova, but is
consistent with it. Breen &amp; McCarthy
(1995) dismiss these with the largely ad hominum
argument that one should not prefer “an eleventh century cleric in an
exuberantly papalist frame of mind being substantially more accurate in his
observation of SN 1054 than the Chief of the Astronomical Bureau in
China.” A more sober evaluation of the state of the Roman Church
during the 11th century as compared to the astrologically motivated Chinese
observation might call for a less extreme comparison.</p>
         <p>It should be noted that at the time of the death of Pope Leo
IX (1054 April 19), there was an extensive display of planets in
the western sky. Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Mercury were all visible at the
same time, along with the bright stars of Orion. It is not unreasonable
that these could well be the “the innumerable brilliant lamps”
of the third reference. Should the supernova have appeared, it would have
only contributed to the show. The first of these references refers to
“an orb of extraordinary brilliance” which briefly appeared at
the “very hour” of the death of Pope Leo
IX. Watterich (1862, p. 95), making
it clear that the canonization of Pope Leo IX proceeded with
considerable alacrity. A comparison of his accomplishments with those of
his predecessors makes it clear why this should have been so, and some of
the “exuberance” referred to by Breen
&amp; McCarthy (1995) may perhaps have appeared in the
form of poetic license regarding the precise timing of the event. However,
the description of the miracles required for sainthood would have been
founded in widely accepted fact.</p>
         <p>Perhaps the most unambiguous European reference to the supernova can
be found in the <italic>Rampona Chronicle</italic>. As stated by the
general editor, Sorbelli (1905),
the <italic>Corpus Chronicorum Bononiesium</italic> is a comparison of two
14th century compilations, the Rampona Chronicle and the Varignana
Chronicle. The former is a history from the beginning of the world to the
present (1425), while the latter, written in the Italian
vernacular, covers a shorter period of time. As mentioned by
Newton (1972, p. 690) and discussed
by Williams (1981), the
Rampona Chronicle describes a bright star appearing about the time of
the supernova. The Rampona Chronicle, complied by Muratori in the late
15th century (see Sorbelli 1905),
is derivative from a variety of sources that now appear to be lost.
The relevant Latin passage quoted below with our translation clearly
has trouble with dates, as exhibited by the curious mixture of Roman and
Arabic numbers, which Williams
(1981) cites as common in the 14th and 15th
centuries.</p>
         <p>
            <disp-quote>

               </p>
               <p>In the
year of Christ 1058 [1055] emperor Henry III was in his
49th [39th] year. He initially came to Rome in the month of May.
At this time there was famine and death throughout the entire land.
He occupied the Tiburtinam State [He stayed in the town of Tivoli,
east of Rome] for three days in the month of June. This Henry was
protector of the mother of the countess Mathilda [Beatrice, widow of
the duke of Tuscany and sister of Henry III] from whom the Marquis
Boniface begot Mathilda herself. This was the time of Henry. During this
time [Henry’s] an extremely bright star appeared in the
circuit of the new moon [at the location of the new moon, i.e., east
of, and close to, the Sun] at the beginning of the night of the 13th
of the kalends. At this time Cardinal Hildebrand, who later became Pope
Gregory, was in council as papal legate in France, where he moved against
those who were Bishops by way of simony, …</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>We have noted in brackets corrections or explanations of certain
aspects of the text. The chronicle continues from this point with a
detailed description of Hildebrand’s actions against simoniac bishops
in France. It is reasonably clear from the description that these were
actions taken under the auspices of Pope Victor II in <sc>a.d.</sc>
1055, specifically, at the councils of Lyons and Chalons, where Hildebrand
with full legatine authority dealt with several simoniac Bishops. An
alternative could be the Council of Sens, which concerned the heresies of
Berengarius and his philosophy concerning the celebration of the Holy
Eucharist. This Council was also presided over by Hildebrand with full
legatine authority in <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054.</p>
         <p>The opening references to the dates “m18”
and “x19” probably result from reading “mliiiii”
as “mlviii” and possibly “xxlix”
as “xlix,” since the
former dates correspond to the actual numbers appropriate for the text.
Emperor Henry III did indeed travel to Italy in the spring of
<sc>a.d.</sc> 1055 for the installation of Pope Victor II in Florence,
among other things (see Steindorff 1881,
p. 2). After the death of the Boniface, Marquis of Tuscany, in 1053,
Henry took on the role of “father protector” for his sister,
the widow Countess Beatrice. Hughs (1948, pp.
209–248, 267) notes that Henry found it necessary in
1055 to dissolve her subsequent secret marriage to Duke Godfrey II of
Lorraine, who had been at odds with the Emperor for some time. This may
have been because Tuscany was the center of opposition to the reform of the
Roman Church instigated by the German Popes appointed by Henry and he
simply could not afford a union between Tuscany and powerful Lorraine. This
would account for the references to the marriage in a source dealing
largely with the affairs of Henry III.</p>
         <p>It is interesting that famine and plague are also mentioned as
occurring at this time in the Near Eastern reference discovered
by Brecher et al. (1978). The
general temporal reference to a bright star near the location of the new
moon is in keeping with the chronology of this section. However, since the
reference clearly refers to the beginning of the night, it is likely that
the date is <italic>13 kalendas Juni</italic>, or May 20. As described above,
the supernova would have been 7° east of the Sun, at a location
commonly associated with the new moon.</p>
         <p>The diversity of sources noted by
Sorbelli (1905) is demonstrated by
the shift in text and style after the passage concerning the star. This
suggests a change of source from a secular one documenting the affairs of
Henry III to a clerical source concerned with the detailed actions of the
church. However, it is interesting that no mention is made here of the
major events in the church of 1054—notably, the death of Pope Saint
Leo IX on <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 April 19 or the Eastern Schism usually dated
to <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 16. This suggests that the entry point to the
now‐lost clerical source is likely to be <sc>a.d.</sc> 1055. While
it is tempting to dismiss a chronicle complied so long after the event and
containing numerous errors of dates, it must be remembered that the Chinese
and Japanese sources are also derivative sources complied at a much later
date than the event.</p>
         <p>To understand the significance of the Rampona Chronicle, it is
necessary to look at the material surrounding the reference to the star.
Virtually all the references before and after the section dealing with
Henry III and the star are clerical. Clearly, the references to the star
and the concerns of the Emperor Henry III were inserted into the church
history from a different source. The phrase <italic>Tempore ipsius
Henrici</italic> suggests that specific dates were relatively unimportant to
the original author. However, the choice of the Latin <italic>stella
clarissima</italic> to describe the star is as superlative as can be
expressed, suggesting that this was indeed a very bright star.</p>
         <p>Breen &amp; McCarthy
(1995) translate the words <italic>prime lune</italic> as
referring to the “first day of the calendar or ecclesiastical
moon.” Since there are no new moons on the 13th of the kalends, they
reject the entire reference out of hand. They further note that the date
disagrees with the Chinese date of July 4. This interpretation clearly
avoids the problem which led Williams
(1981) to state that he could make no sense of the
phrase <italic>in circuitu prime lune ingressa est</italic>. As appears clear
from the style, a secular account would be less likely than a cleric to
refer to the ecclesiastical calendar. Our interpretation that the phrase
denotes a place in the sky rather than a calendar date avoids this problem
and makes this a reference to a dusk sighting, most likely on May 20, when
the supernova would have been just where one would look for the new moon.
Since the events described in the chronicle match actual historical events,
it seems plausible to suggest that this indeed represents a European
sighting of the supernova of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054.</p>
         <p>Finally, there are two references from eastern Europe that
are important. The first, discussed at length by Brecher
et al. (1978), describes the report of an Iraqi
physician, Ibn Butlān, as recounted two centuries later by
Abī Uşaybi‘a. Two references to the end of the Hegira
year of 445 and 446 (corresponding to 1053 April 23–1054 April
11 and 1054 April 12–1055 April 1) are given in different
sections of the recounting by Abī Uşaybi‘a. The latter
range is generally preferred, since it agrees with the Chinese date and
subsequent visibility of the event, while the former is considered a
copying error. However, Guidoboni et al.
(1992) take these dates literally, suggesting that the
earliest date for the supernova should be <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 April
11.</p>
         <p>The second reference is to the Armenian Chronicles of the 9th
through 17th centuries complied by Matenadaran (specifically, see
the chronicle of Etum Patmich in
Akopan 1956).
Astapovich (1974) corrects the dates
and interpretation of an earlier translation by
Astapovich &amp; Tumanian (1969),
where they felt that the reports were of bright meteors. He now believes a
proper translation should read “1054 of the New Era was the fifth
year of the reign of Leo IXth. That year on the Moon’s disk a star
has appeared. It happened on the 14th of May in the first part of the
night.” He believes the reported
location, time and description more correctly describe the supernova event
of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054. Calculations with the program REDSHIFT show that
the Moon and the Crab Nebula were in conjunction on May 11 at approximately
0900 UT. This suggests that it is unlikely that the proximity of the Moon
to the supernova resulted in the phrase “on the Moon’s disk a
star has appeared.” The words
“that year” also suggest that it was more than an ephemeral
event, such as a meteoroid impact. Astapovich &amp;
Tumanian (1969) clearly had difficulty with the
translation and interpretation of this passage, but they make it clear that
the event was very striking and probably represented a new star. One
possibility consistent with their interpretation is that the star was first
noticed on the night of May 14 as a result of either increasing brightness
or weather, and that the phrase “Moon’s disk” can be
translated as “Moon’s
orb,” “Moon’s
orbit,” or “circuit of the
Moon,” indicating a place in the
sky, such as is the case in the Rampona Chronicles. Unfortunately, support
for this hypothesis is unlikely to be found without a reanalysis of the
original of the Chronicle, which is unavailable to
us.</p>

         <title>EASTERN REFERENCES</title>
         <p>The primary references to the supernova of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054
are found in the Chinese and Japanese chronicles. They were
comprehensively translated by Duyvendak
(1942), rediscussed and added to by
Ho et al. (1972), and reinterpreted
by Breen &amp; McCarthy (1995).
Ho et al. (1972) correctly point
out that there are a number of internal inconsistencies in many of these
sources, while Breen &amp; McCarthy
(1995) go to some lengths to establish that many of the
sources are derived from a single earlier source.
Duyvendak (1942) and
Ho et al. (1972) suggest that the
definitive chronicles are the <italic>Sung‐shih</italic> and the
<italic>Wen‐hsien T</italic>’<italic>ung‐k</italic>’<italic>ao</italic>
complied in 1345 and 1280, respectively. Breen &amp;
McCarthy (1995) take the <italic>Sung
hui‐yao</italic> complied by Chang‐Te‐haiang to be the
definitive text, even though Ho et al.
(1972) give the earliest known text as <italic>Hsü
Tzu‐chih t</italic>’<italic>ung‐chein ch</italic>’<italic>ang‐pien</italic>,
whose author, Li Tao, died in <sc>a.d.</sc> 1184. The suggestion is that
many of the later texts derive from this one. As they point out, the date
for the event in this earliest text is internally inconsistent and could be
either <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 4, June, or August. However, it must be
remembered that all the reports cited in the literature were complied after
the event and therefore represent a summary of observations of the
supernova made well after the explosion.</p>
         <p>While <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 4 of has become generally accepted
as the date of the explosion of the supernova, as pointed out
by Ho et al. (1972), certain
anomalies exist in the Chinese references that are regarded as definitive.
For example, the position of the “guest star” is given
as “several inches south east of ζ Tauri.” However,
the actual location of the Crab Nebula is about 1° northwest of
ζ Tauri. Ho et al. (1972) make
a convincing case for the named reference star actually being ζ
Tauri. However, the direction to the Crab Nebula is opposite from that
given in the chronicles, and the angular distance would correspond to much
less than “several inches” if the interpretation offered
by Ho et al. (1972) is correct. On
the other hand, if the reference
star is β Tauri, the
location of the Crab nebula some 6°45<sup>

matches the direction and magnitude given by the Chinese record remarkably
well. To evaluate the plausibility of the account in referring to ζ
Tauri, we used REDSHIFT to reproduce the eastern sky for the morning
of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 4. At the beginning of astronomical dawn,
ζ Tauri is a mere 3° above the horizon.
Upgren (1991) gives a minimum
altitude of 6°–8° for a third‐magnitude star to be
visible. This result is in full agreement with a more extensive extinction
calculation based on the work of Schaefer
(1993), described below. We suggest that a star too low
to be visible at the beginning of astronomical dawn is not likely to be
seen due to the rapidly brightening sky near the horizon. We will now
attempt to quantify this contention.</p>
         <p>To definitively describe the visibility of astronomical objects in
the dawn sky is extremely difficult, since the various obscuring
phenomena described by Minnaert
(1954) and Schaefer
(1993) are difficult to quantify and extremely complex.
However, we can attempt a conservative estimate of the visibility of stars
rising in the dawn using the following argument.
Schaefer (1993) provides various
values for the zenith sky brightness when the Sun is below the horizon. He
also provides a value for the sky brightness near the horizon at the
beginning of astronomical dawn. We assume that the eastern sky
will brighten at least as fast as the zenith, so that one can project a
lower limit for the sky brightness near the eastern horizon during the
dawn. That this provides a true lower limit only requires that the zenith
brighten no faster than the near‐horizon sky. This lower limit is
shown in Figure 1.
Using Minneart’s
(1954, p. 270)
estimate for the first appearance of first‐ and
fifth‐magnitude stars as a function of solar altitude below the
horizon, we can interpolate the sky brightness that would just mask the
appearance of any star of known brightness at the zenith. In
Figure 1 we show these results for
both β and ζ Tauri. However, on July 4 they will both be near the
horizon, so we can expect a higher value of the sky surface brightness to
mask their appearance due to the atmospheric extinction of the stars. This
can be calculated from Schaefer
(1993) by means of his equations (3a),
(3b), and (51), given the zenith distance of the two
stars for a particular solar altitude below the horizon. In
Figure 1 we give the results of this
calculation for both β and ζ Tauri as seen from Beijing. Since
observations made from the more southern location at K’Ai‐Feng
(see, e.g., Breen &amp; McCarthy
1995) will favor the visibility of ζ Tauri, we have
repeated the calculation for this case. The two visibility curves
for ζ Tauri are labeled “N” and “S,”
respectively, while the visibility curve
for β Tauri as seen from
Beijing is labeled “N.” The altitudes for the three cases are
indicated by values associated with arrows showing their position on the
respective visibility curves for the beginning of astronomical dawn. It is
clear that at no time would ζ Tauri be visible in the dawn sky from
either location in China on July 4. However, by virtue of its greater
brightness and higher altitude, β Tauri would be visible from either
location until nearly nautical dawn (i.e., the solar altitude is
−12°). The internal consistency of this procedure is nicely
demonstrated by the fact that the visibility curve for ζ Tauri crosses
Schaefer’s dark sky horizon line at an altitude value consistent
with Upgren’s (1991)
empirical value for the altitude for minimum dark sky visibility
of third‐magnitude stars.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>The response to diminishing atmospheric extinction with the rising
of the star supports the claim that a star not visible at the beginning
of astronomical dawn will generally remain invisible to the unaided
eye. Allowing for about 1° of motion along the steeply inclined
ecliptic per day, we can use Figure 1
to show that it would have been more than a week after July 4 before ζ
Tauri became visible in the dawn sky. Thus, the Chinese reference to ζ
Tauri as the companion star to the supernova is either incorrect or based
on later observations. In that regard, it is worth noting that the chief
astrologer did not make his prognostications concerning the “guest
star” until August 27 (see Ho et
al. 1972), by which time the supernova was no longer visible
in the daytime and would have faded to a more stellar‐like
appearance. In addition, it would have been well away from the Sun and
surrounded by a reasonably rich and presumably familiar stellar field from
which to establish its astrological significance. Thus, it would appear
that July 4 is just one of many observations that went into the Chinese
record and it is perhaps presumptuous to attribute any great significance
to the date as representing the date of the explosion.</p>
         <p>Ho et al. (1972) note that
the Japanese references all give the fourth month as the first appearance
of the supernova. One of the references specifically suggests May
20–29 for a date of the appearance of the star. However,
Breen &amp; McCarthy (1995) present
a protracted argument suggesting that all the Japanese references derive
from the same source and there is an error in the month, so that the date
should be June 28–July 7 in order to agree with the Chinese date.
They rule out the actual date of the fourth month by citing
Mayall &amp; Oort (1942) that
ζ Tauri was in conjunction on May 27 so that no “guest
star” would be visible. However, the actual Japanese date would place
it near Orion in the interval of May 20–29.</p>
         <p>On May 20, the supernova would have been 7° east of the Sun
and would be quite visible as a bright star, near the constellation of
Orion, as described, at dusk. However, the Japanese source refers to the
star as being seen in the east, and as Breen &amp;
McCarthy (1995) point out, Orion is not visible in the
morning sky during June and most of July. We confirm this by calculating
the visibility of α Orionis on July 4 and displaying the results
in Figure 1. It is clear that
this brightest Orion star would not be visible in the morning sky until
late July or August. This apparent inconsistency in the Japanese references
can be understood by consulting the translation of the <italic>Mei
Getsuki</italic> by Xi &amp; Bo
(1966):</p>
         <p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>After the 2nd third of the 4th month, the second year in the Ten
Ki period of Japan, at the time of Chou, a guest star appeared three times
at the Hsiu Tsui (Turtle). It was seen in the east, “with
Ten Kwan Hsing, as big
as Jupiter.”</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The references to multiple appearances suggests that this report
spans some time. This could include evening observations during the stated
fourth month, when it would have been seen in the vicinity of Orion during
May 20–29, as well as a later time when it appeared in the eastern
sky at dawn near the star Ten Kwan Hsing. These authors make this aspect of
the translation a separate sentence, whereas the translation presented
by Ho et al. (1972), which is
repeated by Breen &amp; McCarthy
(1995) and both of which derive from
Duyvendak (1942), include this as
part of the previous sentence, while the reference to “three
times” is absent. The presence of the “three times” also
indicates that the record is a summary of observations made well after the
event.</p>
         <p>Finally, there are two Chinese references that relate the appearance
of a “guest star” to a solar eclipse in 1054. The first of
these is the <italic>Ch</italic>’<italic>I‐tan‐kuo
chih</italic> (Text D of Breen &amp;
McCarthy 1995), written during the middle of the 13th
century. The second is the <italic>Sung‐shih hsin‐pien</italic>
prepared by K’o Wei‐ch’i in the 15th century.
Ho et al. (1972) give a translation
of the latter as</p>
         <p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>During the first year of the Chih‐ho
reign‐period [1054] there was a solar eclipse at midday
and a guest star appeared within the Mao [lunar mansion, the
Pleiades].</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>They further explicitly state that no date is given other than the
year and that the passage is the same as that given in the first reference
cited above.</p>
         <p>Their translation of that first reference is as follows:</p>
         <p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>During the eighth month [of the 23d year of the
Chung—his reign‐period, 1055] the King passed
away…. Previously there was a solar eclipse at midday and a guest
star appeared within the Mao [lunar mansion, the Pleiades]. The
Assistant Officer in the Bureau of Historiography, Liu I‐shou, said,
“Isn’t this an omen that [the King of
Ch’I‐tan] Hsing‐tsung will die?” The
prediction did come true. The same passage is given in
Liao‐shih‐i.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Breen &amp; McCarthy
(1995) translate this passage as</p>
         <p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>[In the 23rd year of the period
Ch’ung‐his] in the 8th moon the lord of the country died.
… Previously there had been a sun‐eclipse, and in the 1st
moon [1055 January 31–February 28] a guest‐star had
appeared in the Pleiades. Liu Yi‐sou, Senior Vice President of the
Bureau of Historiography, said “Now Hsing‐tsung has died,
[these omens] have indeed come true!”</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Ho et al.’s
(1972) translation suggests that the sighting of the
guest star occurred during the solar eclipse. Breen
&amp; McCarthy’s (1995) version suggests that the
guest star sighting had nothing to do with the solar eclipse and occurred
in 1055 January. If the Ho et al.
(1972) translation is correct, then a firm date and
location for the sighting can be found from the only solar eclipse in China
in 1054, which occurred on May 10. Had the supernova exploded in April or
early May, it certainly would have been visible during totality. We now
consider the extent to which astronomical information regarding supernovae
may relate to the various references to the visibility of the supernova
during the spring and summer of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054.</p>

         <title>ASTRONOMICAL CONSTRAINTS</title>
         <p>Much has been discovered about supernovae since the early discussions
of Mayall &amp; Oort
(1942). Determinations of the expansion age of the Crab
Nebula consistently give origin dates in the 12th century (see,
e.g., Trimble 1968;
Wycoff &amp; Murry 1971; and
Nugent 1998), which has been used by
Williams (1981) and others to
suggest that the event in <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 should not be associated
with the Crab Nebula supernova. However, contemporary thought suggests that
the expansion age is a lower limit, due to secular acceleration of the
nebula (see Trimble &amp; Woltjer 1971
and Bietenholz et al. 1991). Other
properties of the Crab Nebula, such as the distance (see, e.g.,
Trimble 1968, 1973)
and reddening (see, e.g., Miller
1973), have been determined, so we can assess the likely
maximum apparent magnitude of the various types of supernovae appropriate
for the supernova that led to the formation of the Crab Nebula. The light
curves appropriate for various types of supernovae can then be compared to
observations from the time in question. We have the following points on
such a curve. Ho et al. (1972)
conclude from <italic>Sung‐shih</italic> and the
<italic>Wen‐shien t</italic>’<italic>ung‐k</italic>’<italic>ao</italic>
that the duration of visibility was from <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 4
to <sc>a.d.</sc> 1056 April 17. The
<italic>Sung‐hui‐yao</italic> suggests that the duration of
daytime visibility was 23 days. Taking the initial observational date as
July 4, the supernova would have been about 60° west of the Sun 23 days
later, so that a comparison with Venus at greatest elongation, and which is
visible in the daytime, is not inappropriate. Thus, we might expect the
supernova to have been

            </inline-formula> kpc for the Crab Nebula, one would
expect an apparent visual magnitude at maximum to be between −6.0 and
−8.5. Correcting for interstellar extinction following
Miller (1973), these values are
reduced to −4.5 to −7.0 visual magnitude, nicely bracketing the
traditional value of −5 used by Mayall &amp; Oort
(1942). Even these reduced values would make the
supernova the brightest object in the sky apart from the Sun and Moon that
anyone of that time had ever seen. The twinkling of a point source of such
brightness would indeed appear to have “pointed rays shot out from it
on all sides,” as described by
the Chinese. However, it is highly likely that if maximum occurred
near conjunction with the Sun it would not be seen for several weeks.
In addition, to fit theoretical light curves we require the magnitude
at maximum to be appropriate for the type of supernova located at the
distance (see, e.g., Trimble 1973)
of the Crab Nebula and reddened according to
Miller (1973).</p>
         <p>In Figure 2 we show
the best fit between <italic>V</italic> light curves for typical supernovae
of various types and the estimated brightness for the Chinese dates. The
light curves were obtained from Doggett &amp;
Branch (1985). Only by taking the intrinsically
faintest type supernova at the greatest distance can we arrange to have the
maximum near July 4. The typical rapid decline to the logarithmic decay
curve for all but those supernovae exhibiting a high‐level plateau
would force the maximum to be well before July 4. The presence of a plateau
such as the Type IIP would push the date of maximum even earlier.
Therefore, it seems clear that the maximum must have occurred before July 4
for a drop to about −3.5 <inline-formula>

         <p>The strongest constraint on the light curve is set by the two
points marking the disappearance from the day‐ and nighttime skies.
It is difficult, but not impossible, to fit this slope with typical Type II
light curves. Even a Type Ib supernova fades too quickly to readily fit
the curve. However, it should be noted, as
Figure 2<italic>b</italic> shows, that
the light curve for Type Ia fits remarkably well with the most probable
peak, occurring around May 14. The effect of the conjunction with the Sun
for this probable peak is shown in the inset of
Figure 2<italic>b</italic>, utilizing the
visibility curves of
Schaefer (1993) for bright objects
close to the Sun.</p>
         <p>While some have suggested that the large temporal interval for the
two Chinese points is greater than any supplied by contemporary
observations, it should be noted that Kirshner &amp;
Oke (1975) followed Type Ia supernova 1972e for over
700 days and found no departure from the linear decline in
brightness. Minkowski
(1964), Shen
(1969), and others have also noted that a Type Ia light
curve fits the Chinese points better than any other options. However,
Minkowski (1968) found other
reasons to question the Crab progenitor being Type Ia and ends his review
article with the statement that “the available data are too scanty to
permit the assignment of a type to the supernova
of +1054.”
Certainly, contemporary models for Type Ia supernovae leave no residual
pulsar and therefore make it difficult to declare the Crab to have been a
Type Ia supernova. Nevertheless, the remarkable agreement of the light
curves with the Chinese points must be added to the growing list of
anomalies for the Crab. Apparently, abundances cannot definitively assign a
supernova type to the Crab (E. Luck 1998, private
communication). Van den Berg
(1973) notes that the expansion velocities agree better
with Type Ia than with Type II expansion velocities, and
Zimmerman (1998) has reviewed the
well‐known “missing mass” discrepancy, suggesting that
the mass of the Crab is only a few percent of that expected from a Type II
supernova explosion. Perhaps it is possible that these anomalies can be
resolved through the extreme variability of Type II supernovae or other
variations of Type I, so we adopt Minkowski’s
(1968) view given above. However, since noting the
accuracy of the fit of the Type Ia light curve to the astronomical
constraints is not the same as assigning the actual type, we proceed to use
that curve to provide an estimate for the brightness throughout the
duration of the event.</p>
         <p>A maximum apparent brightness of about −6 would have made
this event extremely spectacular. However, the conjunction of the supernova
with the Sun on May 27 means that even a maximum visual magnitude of
−6.5 would have been obscured by the Sun for some time.
Using Schaefer’s (1993)
estimate of daytime visibility of objects near the Sun, we show the minimum
magnitude for daytime visibility of the supernova during the time of
conjunction relative to the optimum date for maximum brightness of the
supernova. The inset in Figure
2<italic>b</italic> shows the period near maximum with the most
probably calendar date for the occurrence of maximum brightness. The
temporal errors are indicated by the dotted light curves to either side of
the most probably fit. As in the main figure, the dashed line shows the
minimum magnitude for the visibility of objects near the Sun during the
time of conjunction, from Schaefer
(1993).</p>
         <p>We can now suggest the following sequence of events, which
minimizes conflict between and within the historical references in a manner
that is consistent with known astronomical constraints. In April or early
May of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054, the supernova that has given rise to the Crab
Nebula exploded. The rise time to maximum brightness for a Type I supernova
is poorly known, but is expected to be about several weeks, while that
for Type II is even longer, ranging to months. If one takes the error
limits to their extreme, it is possible that the supernova exploded in
early April, which would make Brecher et
al.’s (1978) correction to the date given by the
Iraqi physician Ibn Butlān unnecessary, since the supernova would
have just appeared at the end of the Hegira year of 445. This appears to be
the view of Guidoboni et al.
(1992), who take April 11 as the first sighting of the
supernova. A somewhat later explosion would still have been early enough
for the supernova to have provided a heavenly sign for the canonization of
Pope Saint Leo IX with only minimal poetic license. It even allows for the
date of the feast of Saint George (April 24) given in the Irish
annals of the extremely metaphorical report discussed by
McCarthy &amp; Breen (1997) to be
accommodated. An early explosion date allows for the supernova to be
visible during totality of the solar eclipse of May 10 and shine brightly
in the dusk during the last 3 weeks of May. The Armenian report of the
evening sky on May 14 is then easily accommodated, as are the Japanese
reports of a new star appearing in the vicinity of Orion during late May.
It also fits the Rampona Chronicle perfectly, since the supernova would
have been just 7° east of the Sun on May 20, in the very location where
one looks for the new moon. Maximum brightness is liable to have occurred
near conjunction with the Sun, thereby minimizing its impact on observers.
The Japanese and Chinese saw it during late June and July. The
identification by the Chinese on July 4 is likely to have been made with
respect to β Tauri, which would have been about the only star visible
close to the supernova in the morning sky. The reported position is in
remarkable agreement with the location of β Tauri. Later, the
proximity to ζ Tauri would lead that star to replace β Tauri as
the identifier. Much later (August 27), when the stellar field
was more complete, the astrologers would be confident enough to interpret
the event for the emperor. By then the star would no longer have been
visible in the daytime sky and would properly be resembling a “guest
star,” rising before dawn. For astrological reasons, the Chinese
would have continued to observe the guest star until it disappeared from
the dark night sky a year an a half later. For convenience, we summarize
this sequence in Table

or brighter would have been an amazing sight. Near dawn the twinkling
and color variation due to atmospheric refraction would have made the
object appear even more active. It would not be surprising if it were
interpreted as showing a disk, which may account for the use of the
word “po,” usually reserved
for comets by the Chinese. Later, as it dimmed, it would become a
“guest star.” Finally,
after nearly two years, the star would no longer have been visible in the
night sky, leading to the final entry from the Chinese
reports.</p>

         <p>We have reviewed reports from the 11th century regarding events that
can be associated with the explosion of a supernova during
<sc>a.d.</sc> 1054, the remnants of which are most certainly what is
known as the Crab Nebula. The interpretation of the section of the Rampona
Chronicle dealing with the appearance of a very bright star is new and
provides a level of internal consistency, strengthening the view that this
is an evening sighting of the supernova. We have offered a sequence of
astronomical events consistent with most aspects of the various reports,
including a number from Europe. These reports, when combined with the
oriental reports, strongly suggest an explosion date of mid‐spring
<sc>a.d.</sc> 1054. However, all the European reports refer to events in
the evening sky during the spring of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054, while none found
so far refer to events in the morning sky of mid‐June and
beyond.</p>
         <p>This curious absence still leaves us with a bit of a mystery.
Indeed, since the references to earlier evening phenomena clearly
demonstrate that such heavenly events were of interest to the residents of
medieval Europe, the mystery surrounding the lack of reports describing the
later and more pervasive morning event is only increased. This state of
affairs would seem to lend credence to the “conspiracy view”
suggested by Thomas (1979),
independently elaborated on by Zalcman
(1979), and further developed by
Lupato (1995) that such writings
were suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The formal separation of the
Church of Rome from the Eastern Orthodox Church, known as the Great Schism,
is usually dated from the excommunication of the Eastern Patriarch Michael
Cerularius, the Emperor Constantine Monomachus, and their followers on
<sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 July 16 by three legates from the Church of Rome. This
event does coincide with the supernova being brilliantly visible in the
dawn sky and on into the day. According to
Runciman (1955), the Schism, while
of minor importance in the East, was viewed as a most important event in
the West, so that events surrounding it deserve some attention.</p>
         <p>While the stated mission that brought the three Roman legates
to Constantinople in the summer of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 was to form
an alliance between the Church of Rome and the Eastern Church by
smoothing over past differences (see, e.g.,
Runciman 1955; Steindorff
1881, p. 261), an excellent case can be made for the two
central parties to the Schism wanting the opposite. Cardinal Humbert, who
headed up the legation to Constantinople, made requirements that he knew
the Eastern Patriarch would not accept. On the other hand the Eastern
Patriarch, Michael Cerularius, regarded the Roman see as morally bankrupt
and controlled by German barbarians. He clearly desired primacy over his
own church. For a variety of reasons, including knowledge of the death of
Pope Leo IX in April (see, e.g., Every
1962) and the legate’s ties to the duplicitous
Marianos Argyros, military governor of the Greek colony in southern Italy
(see, e.g., Runciman 1955;
Gilchrist 1993), he distrusted the
legates and doubted the authenticity of their credentials.</p>
         <p>Zalcman (1979) points out
that Ibn Butlān, the Iraqi physician, Nestorian Christian, and
original author of the Constantinople reference to the supernova (see,
e.g., Brecher et al. 1978), was a
confidant of the Eastern Patriarch, so there can be little doubt that the
rather mystical (see Runciman
1955) Michael Cerularius was aware of the new star in the
sky. It takes very little imagination to see how he might have used such an
omen to support his suspicion of the papal legates. The legates, on the
other hand, would have preferred that such arguments and their visible
proof not be subsequently noted in the West. Thus, perhaps it is not
surprising that the only “eyewitness” record to what both sides
now seem to regard as a somewhat sordid affair is that of the chief legate
and papal secretary Cardinal Humbert de Silva. Some 2 years later,
following the death of Pope Victor II, another legate to Constantinople,
Frederick of Lorraine, became Pope Stephan IX (X) with the help
of Cardinal Humbert. Pope Stephan IX then elevated Cardinal Humbert to
Chancellor of the Roman see and Vatican Librarian. Cardinal Humbert’s
detailed account of the journey to Constantinople contains no reference to
the star.</p>
         <p>While this argument is largely circumstantial, it does provide a
basis for understanding the lack of subsequent references to the supernova
of <sc>a.d.</sc> 1054 in the largely clerical European literature. It
is also a superior to the “poor weather” hypothesis suggested
by Williams (1981) and suggests
that if further references are to be found they are likely to reside in
the secular literature and historical chronicles whose origin is other than
the Church of Rome.</p>
