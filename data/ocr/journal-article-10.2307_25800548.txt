Western Siberia Vitaliy Larichev,1 Uriy Khol'ushkin,1 and Inna Laricheva1 The beginning of the Upper Paleolithic in Western Siberia is now dated to almost 35,000 B.P. The earliest sites reveal a well-developed blade technology and very sophisticated mobiliary art. The evidence suggests that the early Upper Paleolithic developed within Siberia out of the local Mousterian and that there is no need to regard it as an intrusive phenomenon out of the west, as has been traditionally done. The florescence of the Western Siberian Upper Paleolithic began at about the glacial maximum and two major cultural groups can be identified. However, they share many features in common and seem not to have existed in isolation from each other; instead, it is possible to trace numerous complex and interwoven connections between them. Together, they form a Western Siberian Upper Paleolithic technocomplex, which was essentially local but fully as sophisticated and as technologically advanced as was that of Europe. KEY WORDS: Northern Asia; Western Siberia; Upper Paleolithic; D'uktai culture; Mal'ta tradition; Afontova-Kokorevo tradition. INTRODUCTION The study of the Old Stone Age in Russian archaeology began more than a century ago with the discovery of bone and stone artifacts during the building of a military hospital in Irkutsk. The finds would probably have remained unnoticed and lost to science, if they had not fallen into the hands 1 Institute of History, Philology and Philosophy, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk 90, USSR. 359 0892-7537/88/1200-0359S06.00/0 ? 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">360 Larichev, KhoPushkin, and Laricheva of two prominent specialists in Siberian geology, A. L. Chekanovskiy and I. D. Cherskiy. It is due solely to their investigations and publications (Chekanovskiy, 1871; Cherskiy, 1873) that these relics of the Siberian Upper Paleolithic (which were later lost during the 1879 fire in Irkutsk) are now known to science. We consider here the changes in our knowledge of the Upper Paleolithic of Siberia since that time and the current state of the archaeology of primitive societies of this enormous area as the study of them enters its second century. That first discovery of an Upper Paleolithic locality in Irkutsk, after being initially ignored, eventually became the catalyst in setting off a chain of new investigations and finds, which have since changed not only the available data but also the geography of the Upper Paleolithic of Northern Asia. It was followed by the identification of Upper Paleolithic sites near Krasnoyarsk (1884) and Tomsk (1896) and in the Trans-Baikal area (1889). In the prerevolutionary period, all such discoveries were made within the framework of the very few scientific and cultural centers which existed in those regions. However, field investigations became broader and more purposeful after the October Revolution, and Upper Paleolithic sites were found in many new regions of Siberia: the Altai, Tuva, Khakasia, Buryat, Yakut, Western Siberia, and the Soviet Far East (Fig. 1). The total number of localities known now approaches several hundred (Beregovaya, 1960, 1984). Because of this, many of the gaps in our knowledge of the Upper Paleolithic have now been filled, and although there are still blank areas on the map of Northern Asia, most of them may be explained by the lack of intensive surveys specifically for Upper Paleolithic sites within those regions (Larichev, 1972, p. 410), In addition, the characteristic features of the Upper Paleolithic of Northern Asia were identified, the sequence of developmental stages was worked out, and it became possible to correlate the Siberian Upper Paleolithic industries with contemporaneous industries in adjacent territories. The Upper Paleolithic of Siberia is better known than is that of adjacent areas. This is why much of the theoretical work on interregional correlations has been carried out in Siberia and has been based upon the Siberian data. Inevitably, some of the earlier interpretations seem naive to modern scholars: "However, this is the real history of one of the divisions of science, which deals with primitive society, with all its painful and complicated searches for truth, as well as its mistakes and failures" (Larichev, 1969, p. 12). The most important concepts in the archaeology of the Siberian Upper Paleolithic derive from the work of N. D. Cherskiy, I. T. Savenkov, B. E. Petry, N. K. Auerbakh, G. P. Sosnovskiy, V. I. Gromov, G. Merhart, M. M. Gerasimov, A. P. Okladnikov, U. A. Mochanov, and others. The development of these concepts was somewhat unusual in that it involved a well-established</page><page sequence="3">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 361 Fig. 1.

It is for this reason that there long coexisted two explanatory models of the origin of the Upper Paleolithic industries of Siberia: evolution and migration (Larichev, 1972, p. 5; Khol'ushkin, 1981, pp. 12-15). The evolutionary model was dominant for a long time. It first developed under the influence of the natural sciences (Bear, 1865), ethnology (Taylor, 1872-1873; Morgan, 1877), and French archaeology (de Mortillet, 1872) and later developed into a theory of stages. Gorodtsov (1908, 1923), Petry (1923), Sosnovskiy (1934), and Yefimenko (1934, 1953) played critical roles in the formulation of the evolutionary approach to Siberian archaeology. The models of diffusion and migration were introduced into Siberian archaeology from outside by practitioners of western archaeology (Merhart, 1923, 1924; Sawicki, 1928). These ideas were very influential at an early stage in the development of Siberian archaeology (Auerbakh, 1930, p. 41). They were also revived much later by Okladnikov to explain the phenomenon of</page><page sequence="4">362 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva MaFta (1950, 1955a). More generally and under the influence of Movius (1944), diffusionism was invoked by Zam'atnin (1951), Okladnikov (1955b), Sorokin (1953), and Grigor'ev (1977) to help explain local differences in culture. Subsequent accomplishments in the archaeology of primitive societies created a favorable environment for the beginning of research into more local phenomena, specifically into archaeological cultures. During this phase of research, a great number of works were published, which singled out local variants of Paleolithic industries within the territory of Siberia. However, it is not always clear what the defined cultures represent or what their historical and sociological meaning is. These and others are some of the major problems facing us as we stand on the brink of the second century of study of the Siberian Paleolithic. They are discussed as they arise in the following summary of the Upper Paleolithic industries of Western Siberia. THE PROBLEM OF INTERREGIONAL CORRELATIONS OF THE SIBERIAN UPPER PALEOLITHIC The first 15 years of the second century of Siberian Upper Paleolithic archaeology have been remarkable not only for the broad field investigations, surveys, and excavations of numerous sites, but also for the considerable effort that has been devoted to trying to understand and summarize the accumulated material. During this period, several monograph reports have appeared on the Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia (Gening and Petrin, 1985; Petrin, 1986; Markin, 1986) and of Eastern Siberia (Abramova, 1979a, b; Astakhov, 1986; Mochanov, 1977; Mochanov et al, 1983; Okladnikov and Kirilov, 1980; Bazarov et ah, 1982) and on the Paleolithic of the Soviet Far East (Derev'anko, 1983; Dikov, 1977, 1979). These volumes present our most recent ideas concerning the Upper Paleolithic and, as well as large amounts of basic data, also offer some fascinating scenarios for the origin and interaction of archaeological cultures in the Old and New Worlds. This has also involved a great deal of work in the definition of archaeological cultures (Mochanov, 1969,1977; Abramova, 1975; Khol'ushkin, 1983,1985). In the studies mentioned above, a large number of archaeological cultures have been defined, such as the MaPta, Tolbaga, Oshurkovo, Afontova, Kokorevo, D'uktai, Srostki, and Bedarevo cultures. However, it is not always clear at what point our divisions of cultures become too many and artificial. This problem is aggravated by the absence of precise quantitative characterizations of the cultural uniqueness of the various sites. The accepted idea that Paleolithic cultures are regional, chronological, and genetic phenomena (L'ubin, 1972, p. 18) is too general to help in the definition of</page><page sequence="5">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 363 individual archaeological cultures. In addition, none of the criteria used to characterize specific Paleolithic cultures has been worked out in sufficient detail. Thus, we are dealing with possible, rather than definite, characteristics. For this reason, it is useful to consider briefly each of these proposed characteristics in turn. Regional Aspect of Archaeological Cultures Only in recent years has much attention been paid by Siberian archae ologists to the regional aspect of archaeological cultures (KhoPushkin, 1981, 1985; VasiFev, 1984). However, the landscapes surrounding site locations have now been studied in great detail, as have also spatial distributions of archaeological cultures. For example, Mochanov (1977, p. 256) attempts to define two ethnocultural regions of the largest order of magnitude for the MaPta-Afontova and D'uktai cultures, with the boundary between them lying along the watershed of the Lena and Yenisei Rivers. Abramova (1975, pp. 19-31) believes that there is no justification for uniting the MaPta culture with those of the Yenisei Basin and she recognizes Southern and Middle Siberian areas, each with purely local cultures; the Afontova, Kokorevo, Oshurkovo, Tolbaga, and Srostki cultures are represented in the Southern Siberian area, but only the MaPta culture is known from Middle Siberia. In the Yenisei river basin, it is apparent that different archaeological cultures cross-cut the river basin. In essentially the same area, there existed the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures, in addition to those represented by the blade industries of Afanas'eva Gora, Tarachikha, and Golubaya I, which are reminiscent of the MaPta culture. Some investigators have noted not only the differences between cultures, as observed by Abramova, but also the great number of interrelated elements and contacts which they show. On the basis of these similarities, the archae ological complexes have been either linked together or, by considering con trasting combinations of elements, separated from each other (Klein, 1971; Mochanov, 1977; Okladnikov, 1981; KhoPushkin, 1981,1985; VasiPev, 1984). In particular, Klein has suggested that the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures could be functionally different manifestations of the material culture of a single population (1971). KhoPushkin and VasiPev see the main differences between the Kokorevo and the Afontova cultures as being technological, in that they are based on blades and flakes, respectively, which, in turn, has affected their typologies. Okladnikov did not see any qualitative differences between the Paleolithic industries of the Yenisei but saw variation between them as natural differentiation arising from a common sociocultural pattern (Okladnikov, 1981, p. 113).</page><page sequence="6">364 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva The above summary makes it apparent that not sufficient study has yet been devoted to the regional approach. It seems to us that its value would be considerably enhanced if it were to include such synchronic concepts as space and distance, activity areas, and a consideration of space as a factor in the chronological distribution of cultures. Chronological Aspect of Archaeological Cultures In the archaeological literature of Siberia, archaeological cultures are temporally placed with reference to age or periods. Radiocarbon dating and geological and paleontological data permit more precise dating of individual cultures (Table I). The dating of the D'uktai culture is quite acceptable. However, the apparent coexistence of the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures within the same territory demands further consideration, particularly since the later sites seem to be characterized by a mixture of traits typical of both cultures (Vishn'atskiy, 1984, p. 102; Drozdov and Akimova, 1984). Abramova (1979b) has pointed out that the Kokorevo culture did not penetrate into the Minusinsk Depression until relatively late, and this, combined with other preliminary estimates, would indicate a low density of population during the Upper Paleolithic (Hole and Flannery 1967, pp. 149, 154, 165; Wobst, 1974, p. 155; Bibikov, 1969, p. 20). In this case, the relative isolation and low population density could explain the coexistence of the two cultures. The characteristic features which are common to both could then result from the high mobility of Upper Paleolithic reindeer hunters, which would have led to a greater chance of contact between them. However, such explanations, which are expressed most strongly by Okladnikov (1981, p. 113), involve imprecise spatial and temporal characteri zations of the cultures, because the archaeological data are not adequate to define their essential characteristics. We can hypothesize spatial contact between cultures at certain moments in time, as well as formulate hypotheses about the observed similarities as the products of earlier periods (genetic Table I. Estimated Ages of Siberian Upper Paleolithic Cultures Culture Age (years B.P.) D'uktai 35,000-10,360 Mal'ta 24,000 Afontova 20,000-12,000 Kokorevo 15,460-11,600</page><page sequence="7">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 365 similarity). In Abramova's explanatory models, the mechanisms of genetic and spatial connections remain undeveloped and more attention is focused on the specific stage, or archaeological culture itself, as an explanatory variable. At present, there has been only one attempt to examine the process of temporal change in the archaeological complexes of the Yenisei river valley (KhoFushkin, 1985), but that study also requires considerable additional work. Genetic Aspect of Archaeological Cultures This aspect, which is closely connected with the temporal aspect, includes three forms of explanation: the strictly genetic one, which is the explanation of the common origin of archaeological cultures; the evolutionary one concerning the development of archaeological cultures; and the genetic and evolutionary one, which deals with both the origin and the later development of cultures. All of these types of explanation are to be found in studies of the Stone Age of Siberia. The first two were used during the early stages of Siberian archaeology (in the archaeology of primitive societies), while the third has been predominant during the last decade. In addition, there are significant correspondences in the views of different scholars concerning the genesis of archaeological cultures. For example, Mochanov specified the Southern Urals, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Northern China when discussing the sources of the Siberian populations (Mochanov, 1969, p. 235), while Okladnikov and Abramova referred to the Western, middle, and Southern Asiatic elements. This consensus results from the common history of investi gations into the Siberian Upper Paleolithic (KhoFushkin, 1981, p. 19) and does not reflect those changes which occurred with the discovery of Middle Paleolithic localities. However, it should be noted that, even in the 1930s, Sosnovskiy (1934) wrote that there was no reason to search outside Northern Asia for the parent cultures of the Late (Upper) Paleolithic, and it is now apparent that he was correct. Finally, let us consider the problem of the criteria used in defining archaeological cultures. According to Abramova, "the definition of archae ological cultures in Siberia is primarily based on the typology of the stone inventory, including not only tool-morphology but also flaking techniques and, as far as possible, functional characteristics" (1975, p. 24). This formu lation provides for rather detailed analysis of archaeological objects, but even so broad a statement of the problem does not help us to understand the principles by which specific cultures are defined, without some knowledge of the paradigms used by the investigator: the choice of one theory over another is clearly predicated on the paradigms of the individual scientist.</page><page sequence="8">366 Larichev, KboFushkiD, and Laricheva For example, Okladnikov and VasiPevskiy contend that, "the association of Upper Lena burins with Gobi cores may be considered the unifying element, which links together many sites scattered over the enormous territory from Central Asia to Alaska" (1976, p. 96). Mochanov considers that the presence or absence of bifaces is enough to define a "cultural community of the first order" (1969, p. 226). Abramova (1975, p. 24), on the other hand, prefers more detailed indicators and would define the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures as follows: large pebble-cores are typical of the Kokorevo culture, which also has a higher proportion of blades than the Afontova culture; bifacially flaked tools occur in the Afontova culture; burins and projectile points are rare and undiagnostic in the Afontova culture and have no parallels in the Kokorevo culture; and the Afontova microblades are pressure flaked along their edges and have truncated ends, while the Kokorevo micro blades have no secondary retouch. Markin believes that the Bedarevo culture of the Tom* river basin can be adequately defined by the presence of notches and denticulates and tools worked at the proximal end, the rare occurrence of wedge-shaped cores, and the absence of lateral burins (Markin, 1986, p. 159). Petrin, in turn, draws attention to the high degree of similarity between the stone industry of the site of Mogochino I and that of the Afontova culture. He considers this to be only a reflection of the shared level of technology, which was typical of that period, and does not assign Mogochino I to the Afontova culture because of its lack of bone artifacts (Petrin, 1986, p. 109). At present, it is difficult to choose among these hypotheses; all of them need to be tested. This will involve, first, determining what inductive methods are suitable for testing them and then determining to what extent the tests have supported or disproved each hypothesis. If we are to base our discussions on fact, then we must observe that there are no clear and unambiguous definitions of the archaeological cultures. Heterogeneous approaches are frequently used, without any theoretical justi fication, and this has left us with a wide range of essentially subjective taxonomies. It was Okladnikov (1981, p. 112) who pointed out the "narrow ness of the criteria" and their inadequacy for identifying the stone inventories attributable to particular cultures. Recently, some of the criteria of cultural difference mentioned above have been tested by statistical methods (Khol'ushkin, 1983, pp. 143-149), and it has been found that only the technological criteria of bifacial flaking and of the ratio of blades to flakes are of value. This indicates that the concept of "archaeological culture" is not the only way in which archaeological material can be organized and that, at present, because of the limited studies of the archaeological material in Siberia, we may speak only about the existence of regional technological cotraditions. As for the quantitative and percentage-based definitions of</page><page sequence="9">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 367 cultures, the various similarities and differences can also be seen in different parts of a single cultural layer (KhoPushkin, 1981, 1985). From these observations, we conclude that we will obtain a satisfactory understanding of the accumulated archaeological data only by means of more rigorous methods of analysis and more sophisticated theoretical constructs. Without these, our data concerning the Upper Paleolithic of Siberia will remain an intricate tangle of unsolved problems. THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC INDUSTRIES OF WESTERN SIBERIA The Upper Paleolithic of the southwestern regions of Northern Asia has traditionally been interpreted not so much from the numerous archae ological materials found in good stratigraphic context, but its geographical location at the junction of Mongolia, Northern Kazakhstan, and the Urals. Many Soviet investigators still carry on this tradition of search ing for the roots of the Western Siberian Upper Paleolithic industries in areas to the south and west (Abramova, 1979b, p. 191; Petrin, 1986, p. 109). Meanwhile, the large number of stratified sites that have been discovered in Siberia, with both Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic layers and common traits in the development of the stone industres of both, permits us to place the problem of the origin and evolution of the Upper Paleolithic on a local Mousterian basis; this is particularly so since some sites show continuity between the archaic and the Upper Paleolithic complexes. Nevertheless, much still remains unclear concerning the origin of the Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia. For example, it is apparent from the map (Fig. 1) that investigation of the Upper Paleolithic period within the territory has been very uneven. Several local concentrations of Upper Paleolithic sites may be noted: in the Western Siberian Plain, in the vicinity of Krasnoyarsk, in the Ob' and Tom' river basins, in the Chulim and Yenisei river basins (the Minu sinsk Depression and Western Sayan), and in the Altai. The distribution is even thinner if the sites are placed within the Quaternary climato stratigraphical units (Table II). Sites belonging to the earliest stage of the Upper Paleolithic (the Kargin interglacial) are the most rare. For example, among the finds exposed by erosion at Tuva, in the Sagly river valley, there were no elements indicating the presence of transitional types of sites. In Astakhov's opinion (1986, p. 124), the earliest Upper Paleolithic sites in this region could be Levallois in appearance and thus be unidentified.</page><page sequence="10">368 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva Table II.

This early Upper Paleolithic site has yielded dwelling complexes, diverse and stylistically varied mobiliary art, typologically distinctive and striking assemblages of stone and bone artifacts, and an abundance of mineral ore in the dwellings which was used for making paint, all of which have revealed many previously unknown aspects of the cultural history of Upper Paleolithic man of Siberia. Above all, the site has cast a new and unusual light on the intellectual world of the Upper Paleolithic (Larichev, 1978a, p. 105, 1984, pp. 20-31); several publications devoted to the carvings of mammoths, tortoises, and owls have discussed the problem of the cosmo logical ideas of the Upper Paleolithic inhabitants of Siberia (Larichev, 1978b, 1979, 1980). The age of the Malaya Siya site has been determined by radiocarbon. The first date, 20,370 B.P. ? 340 years (SDAS-1124), was obtained from a small sample of charcoal gathered by Ovodov from a large area of the cultural layer that had been exposed by a sand pit and is obviously too young (Muratov et al., 1982, p. 36). Radiocarbon dates on bones from the site are considerably older: 34,500 B.P. ? 450 years (SDAS-1286) and 33,060 B.P. ? 300 (SDAS-1287). The geomorphological studies carried out by Troitskiy and Muratov favor the older dating. The settlement is situated on the slope of a ravine, some 400 m in from its mouth and 38 m above the level of the modern White Iyus river. The ravine is older than the first terrace, since it is truncated by the terrace. The cultural layer of the site is associated with a series of terrestrial deposits, which are mechanically identical. They include heavy sandy loams and slightly sandy silt, which differ from each other in color, bedding, texture, and inclusions (Fig. 2). The frost cracks which cut the cultural horizon could have formed during the short Conoshchel' cold phase (33,000-30,000 B.P.) and the large ice wedges dissecting the cultural layer (which represent the upper limits of the site) would have been formed about 20,000 years ago, in the Gidansk stage of the Sartan glaciation (Larichev, 1978a, p. 107). Pollen analysis of soil samples from the cultural layer itself seems to correspond to the Conoshchel' cold phase and indicates a wormwood-cereal steppe, which extended over the low-mountain areas and yielded to forest associations farther up the valley of the White Iyus (Muratov et aL, 1982, pp. 45-46). The faunal remains, which include at least 13 species of mammals, are also indicative of the antiquity of the site. The following species have been identified: Elephas primigenius, Coelodonta antiquitatis, Equus caballus,</page><page sequence="12">370 Laricbev, KhoPushkin, and JLaricheva 1_* &amp; ^ ^ * A B C D Ei Ez Ez 0 40 CM i-1_i Fig. 2.

The presence of Coelodonta antiquitatis in the Malaya Siya faunal assemblage has evoked considerable interest, since, in Paleolithic sites of Southern Siberia, this species is an indicator of relatively high antiquity (Muratov et al.9 1982, p. 46). The cultural materials from the site are in accord with this conclusion. Apart from its own peculiarities, the Malaya Siya stone inventory is similar in appearance to contemporaneous assemblages from sites located east of Lake Baikal: Varvarina Gora [34,900 B.P. ? 700 years (SDAS-850)] and Tolbaga [34,860 B.P. ? 2100 years (SDAS-1522)]. Moreover, analogies occur not only in manufactural technology but also in the tool typology. The Malaya Siya assemblage is characterized by the presence of prismatic and</page><page sequence="13">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 371 cubic cores (Fig. 3: 18), from which blades of large and medium size were struck; however, the presence of microcores at Malaya Siya distinguishes it from the other two sites (Larichev, 1978a, p. 108). The stone tools include various types of large scrapers (skreblo), endscrapers (Fig. 3: 19), some of which are retouched along their edges (Fig. 3: 15), and circular scrapers with retouch over half of their perimeters (Fig. 3: 3); the last type is found later in the Afontova-Kokorevo sites. There are also many large and medium sized blades retouched along the edges (Fig. 3: 1,2, 4-6, 9), knives (Fig. 3: 10-12), fragments of these types, triangular and oval knives (Fig. 3: 13, 14), various types of burins (Fig. 3: 1,2, 7), and notched and denticulated pieces (Fig. 3: 8), some with spiny projections. The Malaya Siya tool-kit also includes blades with bifacial retouch, pebble tools, and bone implements (Fig. 3:16,17). On the basis of the artifacts, this site, together with Afontova Gora and Tolbaga, represents an early stratum of Upper Paleolithic localities preceding the Sartan glaciation (Okladnikov and Kirilov, 1980, p. 39). The mobiliary art is the most striking feature of this collection, and it provides a new comprehension of the specifics of the cultural process in Western Siberia. A single ornament, consisting of a half-disk of soft stone, was noted at Afontova Gora (Okladnikov and Kirilov, 1980, p. 33) and a sculpture of a bear was found at Tolbaga. In contrast, preliminary and still-incomplete analyses of the Malaya Siya site have already revealed various small specimens of art, such as sculpture, bas-relief, engravings, and stamps (Larichev, 1978a, p. 108) (Fig. 4), as well as an unprecedented artifact, which is semantically so complex that, in Larichev's opinion, it may represent a practical device for the calculation of time and, considering its geometric modulation, perhaps even an instrument for paleoastronomical observations (Larichev, 1984, p. 31). Malaya Siya has thus revealed the unexpectedly high age of the earliest Siberian Paleolithic art, which already shows developed and complex representational and compositional conventions. We may now continue the search for the source of Siberian Paleolithic art beyond the temporal limits of the Upper Paleolithic (Larichev, 1978a, p. 119). There is also a series of industries in the Altai, south of Malaya Siya, which are often referred to the initial stages of the Upper Paleolithic. One of these is represented at the Kara-Bom site, not far from the village of Yelo (Gorno-Altai Autonomic Region). The fifth and lowermost layer of this site yielded bones of Coelodonta antiquitatis, Equus caballus, and Bos or Bison, as well as stone artifacts which, according to Okladnikov's short description (1983, p. 16), included cores, a scraper, notches and denticulates, blades, and flakes. Okladnikov believed that the cultural layers of the site should date to about 40,000-30,000 years ago. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess the cores and tools from the various layers on the basis of the drawings of them. Overall, insofar as we may judge from the descriptions and drawings, the site</page><page sequence="14">372 Larichev, KhoPushkin, and Laricheva Fig. 3. Stone and bone artifacts from Malaya Siya.

Some scholars are of the opinion that the cultural layers of Denisova Cave date to the initial period of the Upper Paleolithic. The general charac teristics of the assemblages have been summarized elsewhere (Larichev et al., 1987). The MaFta Tradition The next stage of the Upper Paleolithic, which dates from the beginning of the Sartan glaciation in Western Siberia, is marked by the presence of two very different technological traditions: MaFta and Afontova-Oshurkovo (Okladnikov, 1968a, p. 69). The first tradition is represented by the following</page><page sequence="16">374 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva sites: Achinsk, Tarachikha, Afanas'eva Gora, Chernooz'or'e II, Tomsk, Shikaevka, and Golubaya I. Prismatic blades predominate at these sites and the typical "Siberian" traits are almost completely absent. The sites resemble each other in many respects and seem to have been occupied within the period 18,000-12,000 years ago. The Achinsk site is one of the most noteworthy localities of this group. It was discovered in 1963 by Avramenko (1963) and investigated by Mat'ush chenko (Anikovich, 1976) and by Larichev (1974). The site is in the upper part of a ravine which cuts into the valley of the River Tipt'atka (a right tributary of the River Chulim) on the southwestern outskirts of the city of Achinsk (Zeitlin, 1979, p. 49). The thin (1- to 2-cm) cultural layer is in the uppermost part of a swampy, yellow-gray, sandy loam, which occurs in the lower part of the top of the left bank of the ravine. The fossil fauna consists of Mammuthus primigenius, Equus caballus, Ovis ammon, Cams lupus, Alopex lagopus, and Lagopus lagopus, indicating periglacial conditions at the time of occupation. The situation of the site in the upper reaches of the narrow ravine, protected from the northerly winds by the high watershed on the right, also testifies to prevailing conditions of cold. The lithic assemblage from the early years of excavation at the Achinsk site was published by Anikovich (1976). The collection seems not to have included the wedge-shaped cores which are typical of the Siberian Paleolithic, but cores were present on which blades had been struck from the thicker end ("wide-platformed cores"; Fig, 5: 25, 27). There were many single-platform cores for the production of blades (Fig. 5: 22, 24), some of them heavily exploited and more or less pyramidal in shape (Fig. 5:26). Opposed-platform cores were quite numerous; blades were struck from them in one or several planes. There were also discoidal (Fig. 5: 23), 90?, and multiple-platform cores (Anikovich, 1976, pp. 157-159). Many of the cores from the site, including one discoidal example, were used as blanks for tools. Pebble tools were comparatively numerous and included a chopper (Fig. 5: 28) and several scrapers (skreblo) (Fig. 5: 16, 19, 29). Scrapers were a common tool class (Fig. 5: 11, 12, 17, 18, 20) and included nucleiform and keeled scrapers and end scrapers made on flakes. There were many notched blades (Fig. 5: 3-7, 14, 15), which together with the flake tools (Fig. 5: 13), formed a noteworthy series, and many blades with laterial or terminal retouch (Fig. 5: 1, 2, 8). Rarer types included scaled pieces (Fig. 5: 21), perforators (Fig. 5: 10), burins, a perforator-scraper (Fig. 5: 9), and ivory artifacts. Comparative analysis of the materials from MaPta and Achinsk reveals such common features as the flaking technique, notched and discoidal tools, truncated blades, and some types of retouched flakes. Avramenko and other later scholars (Abramova, 1966; Okladnikov, 1968b; Khol'ushkin and</page><page sequence="17">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 375 Fig. 5. Artifacts from Achinsk.

However, these similarities can be interpreted only at the most general level, as an illustration of the same type of cultural phenomenon, since there are just as many differences between the collections. We believe that the roots of the Achinsk site should be sought in the early stages of the Western Siberian Upper Paleolithic. A carved mammoth ivory baton found during the Achinsk excavations shows that these roots go back to the period of Malaya Siya (Arustam'an, 1987; Larichev, 1983, 1987; Larichev and Arustam'an, 1987). On the surface of the baton are engraved holes, arranged in lines, bands, and spirals (Fig. 6). These are usually regarded as decorative but, in fact, make up a numerical pictogram reflecting 3 years of a complex lunar-solar calendar system. The Tomsk site dates from the same period as Achinsk?18,300 B.P. ? 1000 years (GIN-2100)?but the lithic assemblage gives no indication of cultural affinity. The artifacts have been described by Abramova and Mat'ushchenko (1973, pp. 16-23) and it is clearly a blade industry, with blades struck from prismatic cores. The only published example of this is a photograph of a unifacial core with one striking platform (Fig. 7: 15). The tool-kit consists of two angle burins (Fig. 7: 1, 2), a scraper (Fig. 7: 3), two scaled pieces (Fig. 7: 4), and five blades with obverse lateral retouch (Fig. 7: 5-7, 9). Some scholars believe that this industry has analogies in the material from Achinsk and from sites in the Tom' river basin and in the valley of the Yenisei (Tarachikha). The industry from Tarachikha is quite different from that from all other known early sites in the Yenisei valley. The site was washed out by the Krasnoyarsk Sea, which redeposited the animal bones and flaked stones on a high terracelike projection without great disturbance (Abramova, 1983). The faunal remains included Mammuthus primigenius, Rangifer tarandus, Ovis ammon, Bisonpriscus, Bovidae, Alopex lagopus, Equus sp., Marmota sp., and Citellus sp. There were about 5000 flaked stones artifacts at the site, most of them simple flakes and chips. Various types of cores were found, and to judge from the negative scars, all of them were used for the production of blades and microblades (Abramova, 1983, p. 45). There were unifacial cores with one or two striking platforms, as well as cores with flake scars on their thicker ends and lateral surfaces, discoidal cores, and two wedge-shaped examples (Abramova, 1983, p. 46, Fig. 1). On the whole, the flaking technology at Tarachikha was similar to that of Afanas'eva Gora and MaPta, as well as of the Kokorevo sites (Abramova, 1983, p. 49). How ever, unlike the latter, at Tarachikha there were many cores for the produc tion of small irregular blades but typical wedge-shaped cores were almost absent.</page><page sequence="19">a Fig. 6. Calendrical baton from Achinsk, (a) Overall view; (b) position of spirals on baton surface; (c) schematic representation of spirals as tapes indicating numbers of holes. The tool-kit was rather unusual. It consisted mainly of large blades and small retouched blades (Fig. 8: 3, 4), including a blade with inverse denticu lations along one edge and microblades with notched or retouched edges. There were multiple, angle, and lateral burins (Fig. 8: 10-12), a perforator (Fig. 8: 7), and a blade with a notch from which a small burin spall had been</page><page sequence="20">378 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva Fig. 7.

There were numerous endscrapers made on complete and truncated blades (Fig. 8: 5, 8, 9) and various scrapers made on flakes. The large scrapers on blades (skreblo) at Tarachikha have no analogues among the inventories of known early European sites. A few pebble tools were found; some of them had been used as hammerstones and punches, and one was a typical chopper with a straight denticulated edge (Abramova, 1983, p. 49). Also of very great interest is the presence of a partially bifacial, leaf-shaped point (Fig. 8: 6). Bone tools were represented by a pendant made of a perforated deer tooth (Fig. 8: 2).</page><page sequence="21">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 379 Fig. 8.

The stone industry of the Afanas'eva Gora site also has its own peculi arities (Lisitsin, 1980, pp. 270-276). The technique of flaking was quite simple: cores were usually made on small pebbles, from which the top was removed by a single blow at an angle of 50? to the long axis of the rock; small blades were then struck from this plain platform. If the process was suc cessful, another plain platform was made at the opposite end of the pebble and blades were struck from both platforms. Ninety-degree cores were also used. In the entire collection, we have identified 15 single-platform and 15 double-platform cores and 5 with three striking platforms; there were also three discoidal and several amorphous examples (Fig. 9). One core was reworked into a discoidal tool with a zigzag edge. Except for the microscrapers, the tools found at Afanas'eva Gora were made on large and small blades. Retouched blades were quite numerous</page><page sequence="22">380 Larichev, Khorushkin, and Laricheva</page><page sequence="23">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 381 (Fig. 10: 1-11) and the best-made of them were quadrilateral pieces with retouched ends and edges (Fig. 10: 3, 9, 10). A second class was of blades retouched at one edge and end; the other end was snapped off or deliberately truncated (Fig. 10:1, 2,4,11). A type with a diagonally beveled and abruptly retouched distal end is also of some interest. The retouch was less pronounced on the smaller blades, which are characterized by the presence of separate areas of retouch. The points were atypical and undiagnostic. Notches were made on blades or flakes (Fig. 10: 26-29), some of them with two opposed notches. The burins included dihedral (Fig. 10: 17-20, 24,25), angle (Fig. 10: 22,23, 30), and lateral specimens. The single perforator was of a type unusual in the Yenisei Paleolithic (Fig. 10: 21). The numerous scrapers were made on flakes (Fig. 10: 12-16) and included endscrapers and sidescrapers. The collection also contained retouched flakes. Finally, one more of the Yenisei sites is worthy of note as having a somewhat unusual lithic assemblage: Golubaya I, which was discovered by Astakhov in 1971. The site is situated on an ancient promontory, 1 km from the mouth of the River Golubaya (a right tributary of the Yenisei). Occupation was contemporaneous with the sandy alluvium of the second terrace. In the third (main) layer was an oval concentration of cultural remains with a hearth built of flat stones in the center, interpreted by Astakhov as a light weight, surface dwelling (Astakhov, 1986, p. 103). The age of the site is based upon four radiocarbon dates: 13,050 B.P. ? 90 years (M-l 101) (on charcoal), 12,900 B.P. ? 150 years, 13,650 B.P. ? 180 years, and 12,980 B.P. ? 140 years (all on bone) (Astakhov, 1986, p. 101). Unlike Tarachikha and Afanas'eva Gora, there were no mammoth remains at Golubaya I. The faunal assemblage consisted of Bison sp., Bos sp., Cervus elaphus, Equus hemionus, Lepus sp., and Capricornus. This indicates a regional forest vegetation less rich than the modern one. Pollen analysis of a sample taken from the cultural layer yielded pollen of spruce, pine, and plantain (Astakhov, 1986, p. 101). The stone assemblage from the third cultural horizon yielded no evi dence concerning the primary flaking technique. The only cores in the collection were made on flakes and were used for the production of micro blades. As at Afanas'eva Gora, there were no typical wedge-shaped cores. The collection included wide-platformed cores and prismatic examples with two striking platforms. Large and small scrapers were the most common tool class; the four large ones were made on blades and flakes. The most common scrapers were endscrapers on blades and flakes, both whole and broken (Fig. 11: 14, 15). The specimens on flakes included double scrapers (Fig. 11:13) and nosed and shouldered examples. Laterally retouched blades were the second most numerous tool class (Fig. 11: 18, 19); one noteworthy example had two wide</page><page sequence="24">5 ^ ^ ^ a ^ 3 ^ ^^^^^ Fig. 10.

Micropoints ? ? + All of this shows clearly that the Golubaya I site is sharply different from the Afontova-Kokorevo localities. At sites of the Kokorevo culture, as defined by Abramova, there are some artifacts similar to those of Golubaya I: scrapers on retouched blades, laterally retouched blades, burins, and small cores resembling multiple burins. However, this is the limit of the similarities between Golubaya I and the Kokorevo sites, and there are few similarities between Golubaya I and Tarachikha or Afanas'eva Gora. At all three of these sites, the stone tools are made on narrow blades and there are no scaled pieces. Some of the similarities and differences in their inventories are given in Table III, which shows that the interconnections of these industries, which seem at first sight very similar, are in reality more complex than Abramova has suggested (1983). Two sites, where the technology was based on prismatic blades, are known in Western Siberia: Chernooz'or'ye II and Shikaevka (Petrin, 1986). Unfortunately, the collections from these sites are not large. According to Zeitlin (1979, p. 65), the Shikaevka occupation was con temporaneous with the second, 8-m terrace of the River Tobol. Cultural remains, including bones and flint tools, lay under both frost-affected deposits and the remains of two stages of soil formation. Stratigraphically, therefore, the remains should date to about 13,000 years (Zeitlin, 1979, p. 65). Pollen analysis of soil samples taken from the cultural layer of Shikaevka II indicates a cold climate (Petrin, 1986, p. 27). The samples contained some pollen of conifers (pine, spruce), a few spores of ferny and bog mosses, and pollen of wormwood and Compositae. The great majority of animal bones was of mammoth (227); the remainder (27) was of wolf, saiga, reindeer, hare, and yellow and steppe mice. The anatomical distribution of the bones is such that we cannot be sure where the mammoths were hunted, and it is quite possible that they were not hunted at all.</page><page sequence="27">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 385 Thirty-five blade tools, struck from prismatic cores, were found at Shikaevka II. The geometries (Fig. 12: 1-9) are the most diagnostic. There were also blades with lateral, sometimes partial, retouch (Fig. 12: 14-19), notched blades (Fig. 12:10-13, 23, 26,27), and unretouched blades (Fig. 12: 20-22, 24, 25). In trying to identify the cultural affinities of the locality, Petrin follows the traditional approach of looking westward for advanced technologies and does not consider Siberian analogies. For example, the nearest analogy he can find for the geometric tools is the Federmesser of the Late Paleolithic of the North European Plain (Petrin, 1986, pp. 33, 103). We believe that it is more useful to search for analogies closer to home. The closest analogues of the Shikaevka geometric tools are in the Mesolithic Yangel' culture (Mat'uskin, 1976, p. 161, Fig. 3: 1,2,4, 5,13, and 14 and Fig. 4: 1-3), but these represent a stage of development subsequent to Shikaevka II. Earlier analogues do exist in Western Siberia. For example, in Layer 9 of the Denisova Cave was an asymmetrical segment with a retouched convex edge and straight base, and Afanas'eva Gora yielded direct analogues for the blades with a retouched edge and end and with a beveled and retouched end and for the partially retouched blades. The second Western Siberian site, Chernooz'or'ye II, yielded three cultural layers contemporaneous with the second river terrace. In Zeitlin's opinion, the radiocarbon date for the site, 14,500 B.P. ? 500 years (GIN-622), is slightly too old (1979, p. 61). Petrin's publication of Chernooz'or'ye II suggests that wedge-shaped cores were absent. There were no large scrapers of the Siberian type and very few pebble tools. The tool-kit was based upon laterally retouched blades, scrapers on flakes, perforators, notched and denticulated pieces, and multi faceted and transversal burins (Petrin, 1986, pp. 104-106). The closest similarities to Chernooz'or'ye II may be found in sites of the Kokorevo culture, as well as in the Western Siberian blade industries discussed above. Finally, we come to recent discoveries at the Denisova Cave, which shows a steady evolution of the Upper Paleolithic between Layer 12 and Layer 9. Layer 12 retained distictly archaic features: the Mousterian index was 78.9 and tool blanks such as the microblade were lacking; there were, however, backed blades (Derev'anko et ah, 1985). The industry in Layer 11 was characterized by fewer Mousterian forms (the Mousterian index was 59.5); microblades appeared, including one with a backed edge, although the assemblage was essentially bladeless. Layer 11 yielded a bead decorated with a meander motif, an example of Paleolithic art which is unique in the Altai (Fig. 13: 9); there were also perforated pendants (Fig. 13: 10, 11) (Derev'anko et ah, 1985). In Layer 9, there was some admixture of archaic traits, such as</page><page sequence="28">386 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva 1^-0 ^-o 21 w l?f PI III Zs 26 27 i_1_1_i Fig. 12.

Levallois points, notches and denticulates, scrapers (skreblo), and knives with flat butts. However, there was also a scaled piece, a prismatic core (Fig. 13: 1), retouched blades (Fig. 13: 5), including some with distal truncations (Fig. 13: 8), and backed blades (Fig. 13: 3, 4). The backed blades with straight beveled ends have parallels at Afanas'eva Gora. Other tools in Layer 9 included endscrapers on blades (Fig. 13: 2, 7) and on blade fragments and carinated scrapers (Fig. 13: 6). These sites of the Western Siberian Upper Paleolithic have many features typical of the European Paleolithic. Nevertheless, the complex was not an intrusive phenomenon in the region, for which the roots must be sought outside Siberia. On the contrary, this complex of artifacts has a broad distribution over Northern Asia and deep, although poorly understood, roots which lead back through the early stages of the Upper Paleolithic and into the local Mousterian, as indicated by the presence of the Levallois technique.</page><page sequence="30">388 Larichev, KhoPusbkin, and Laricheva The Afontova-Oshurkovo Tradition We now turn to the sites which were traditionally regarded as typical of the so-called "Siberian Late (Upper) Paleolithic." It is important to reexamine this cultural "unit" carefully, since the sites of the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures, which were formerly considered to be purely local phenomena confined to the Yenisei river basin, now appear to be parts of a very broad, pan-Siberian cultural unity (Vasil'ev, 1984). This somewhat corroborates Okladnikov's hypothesis of the existence of an extraordinarily monotonous Afontova-Oshurkovo culture over vast regions of Northern Asia, from the Altai to the River Amur (Okladnikov, 1968a, p. 69). At present, several tens of localities are known in Western Siberia. Most of them have been quite well reported in the Western literature and are therefore only generally appraised here; more detailed characterizations are given of the recently discovered sites. The oldest of the sites under consideration are Mogochino, dated to 20,150 B.P. ? 240 years (SDAS-1513), and Afontova Gora II, dated to 20,900 B.P. ? 300 years (GIN-177). Mogochino is situated on a high terrace, 35 m above the modern level of the River Ob'. The faunal remains included mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, bison, horse, reindeer, fox, and Arctic fox. The complete sequence of stone tool manufacture could be traced at Mogochino. Wide-platformed (50.0%), flat (16.9%), and discoidal (3.6%) cores were typologically diagnostic. Flat and discoidal cores were used to produce blades and flake-blades, while the wide-platformed cores, most of which were wedge-shaped, served for the striking of small blades and micro blades (Petrin, 1986, p. 98). Petrin sees the flat cores as a further development of the tradition of core treatment from the Levallois technique and also traces a connection between the flat and the wide-platformed types. The assemblage from Mogochino I is most similar to those from Afontova Gora II and III, Tashtik I and II, and Kokorevo II and III. Typologically, the assemblage is characterized by large tools made on pebbles, blades, small retouched blades, scaled pieces (Fig. 14: 7), scrapers (skreblo) on pebbles and flakes (Fig. 14: 1, 2), endscrapers, scrapers on flakes (Fig. 14: 3-6), and burins. There are two groups of sites of the Afontova-Kokorevo culture in the Minusinsk Depression. One is characterized by the presence of mammoth bones and ash lenses; the second has neither mammoth bones nor ash lenses but has hearths curbed with stones (Abramova, 1979a, b; Safarova, 1985). The lithic technologies of the two groups are similar and flaking was done from Levallois and wedge-shaped cores. However, in the Afontova localities, flakes and microblades were produced, whereas blades and microblades were produced at the Kokorevo sites. The microblades were used without secondary retouch at the Kokorevo sites, but were retouched at the Afontova sites.</page><page sequence="31">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 389 1 /I e 7 Fig. 14. Stone artifacts from Mogochino. (1,2) Scrapers (skreblo); (3-6) scrapers; (7) scaled piece (Petrin, 1986). In terms of typology, both groups of localities of the Afontova-Kokorevo culture have archaic Mousterian tools and pebble tools associated with Upper Paleolithic types and thus form a single unit, within which there are many points of similarity between the groups. Nevertheless, there remain considerable differences between them. The Afontova sites are characterized by the presence of microadzes, micropoints, microscrapers, and double scrapers, as well as double scrapers (skreblo) on flakes with convex edges and inverse retouch, and large scrapers made on flake fragments with obverse or inverse lateral retouch; such tools are peculiar to the Afontova sites and they do not occur in Kokorevo I or Novos'olovo VI and VII. In turn, the Kokorevo sites are characterized by retouched blades, dihedral angle burins, lateral burins, a different style of retouch, and scrapers {skreblo) on blades, including convergent varieties. We should also consider, however, that recent work at Ber'ozoviy ruchey I (Vishn'atskiy, 1984) and Listvenka has revealed a mixture of the traits of these two industries. Farther to the south, in the upper reaches of the Yenisei, research has been carried out at a new series of Paleolithic sites, which chronicle the development of Paleolithic culture in the period 18,000-10,000 years ago. The main features of stone and bone inventories of some of them are briefly summarized below. At Kantegir /, the flaking technique was, on the whole, similar to that of most other Paleolithic sites in the Yenisei. Single- and double-platform cores were the most common, usually unifacial (Astakhov, 1986, p. 93); discoidal cores were rare. Wide-platformed (Fig. 11:2, 3) and single-platform prismatic cores (Fig. 11:1) were used for the production of microblades. Most tools were made on flakes. Typologically, the assemblages from the five layers of</page><page sequence="32">390 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva the site were characterized by the extensive use of scrapers on flakes (Fig. 11: 5-7) and various scrapers (skreblo; Fig. 11: 4, 8), most of them convex sidescrapers. The relative frequencies of artifact types vary between layers, but overall, they conform to the frequencies of types at the Afontova group of sites. Retouched blades and tools made on blades were very rare at Kantegir I; scaled pieces were quite common, and there were also pebble tools and denticulated and notched artifacts. We may also note a series of traits similar to those of the Kokorevo group: denticulated and notched pieces, the occurrence of polishers, and the manufacture of inverse scrapers. The collections from Maina, Joy, and Sizaya VIII are similar to that of Kantegir I. Of these, the largest collection is that from the nine cultural layers of Maina I (Fig. 15). The primary flaking was based upon discoidal and wide-platformed cores with one or two striking platforms (Vasil'ev and Ermolova, 1983, p. 73). Tool blanks were predominantly flakes, although microblade technology was also developed. Besides the usual wedge-shaped and wide-platformed types, there are also elongated cores made on retouched preforms. Scrapers (skreblo) were the principal tool class; most of them were convex or straight sidescrapers, but there were also double, transversal, canted, peripherally retouched and bifacially concave, circular, shouldered, notched, and other varieties (Vasil'ev and Ermolova, 1983, p. 73). Less numerous were notches, denticulates, pebble tools, retouched blades, projectile points, burins, and perforators. Layer 5 yielded an anthropomorphic statuette made of reddish brown, unevenly fired clay (Fig. 15: 7), which is unique in the USSR. The technology and tool typology are similar to those of the Afontova group of sites; however, analogies to the denticulated scrapers (skreblo) from Maina are found only in the Kokorevo sites. Layer 6 and Layer A of Maina I produced microcores, which had had small blades struck from the center of the perimeter; they resemble the multifaceted burins from Golubaya I and Kokorevo I. There are some analogies to the Yenisei sites in the Altai, in the lower cultural layer of Maina, at Ust'-Kuyum, and at Srostki. On the basis of analysis of the Srostki material, Abramova has tried to define a new culture, of the same name, similar to the Kokorevo culture (1979b). This seems to us to be unwarranted; on the one hand, such typical Srostki types as retouched blades, points, pebble tools, scrapers, and wedge-shaped cores also occur in the Kokorevo and Afontova groups of localities, and on the other hand, narrow "scraper(jfcreW0)-knives" (in Sosnovskiy's terminology) have been found as far east as Mal'ta, However, the diagnostic series of large scrapers and the predominance of tools made on flakes have many more points of resemblance to the Kokorevo II industry than to that of Kokorevo I. Finally, we mention the group of sites assigned by Markin (1986) to the Bedarevo culture. These sites include workshops, where the preparation of</page><page sequence="33">Upper Paleolithic of Western Siberia 391 Fig. 15. Stone artifacts and art from Maina [Layer 2 (4); Layer 3 (1-3, 5, 6); Layer 5 (7)]. (1) Scaled piece; (2) wedge-shaped core; (3) extensively retouched blade; (4) scraper (skreblo); (5) scraper(j/rr^6/(?)-knife; (6) single-platform core; (7) clay statuette (Vasil'ev and Ermolova, 1983). raw material took place (Shumikha I), and short-term campsites (Bedarevo II, IPinka II, and Shorokhovo I). The cultural horizons of these sites lie either in the uppermost sandy loams of the third terrace [Shorokhovo I, Il'inka II, Shumikha I(?)] or in the top of the slope deposits of the terrace. The technology was based upon parallel flaking of blades from wide-platformed, single- and double-platform cores. The tools included blades with retouched edges and straight or oblique retouch at the ends, notches and denticulates, specimens of thick ends, and angle and symmetrical burins. Some analogies</page><page sequence="34">392 Larichev, Khol'ushkin, and Laricheva to these forms occur at sites of the Afontova, Kokorevo, and Mal'ta groups. Localities similar to those of the Afontova culture occur in the series of Preangar'ye (Cher'omushnik, Shamotniy Zavod, Baday) and in the Trans Baikal area. Thus, sites with specific affinities are very widespread across Siberia. Their distribution is mosaic in nature and areas of different affinity cross-cut each other. Because of this, it is still not possible, given the data at hand, to delimit the territorial concentration of the main industrial variants of this time horizon in Western Siberia. CONCLUSION Study of the Upper Paleolithic localities of Western Siberia shows that two cultural groups, with their roots in the local Mousterian, existed in this region. The first group is characterized by a somewhat archaic stone inventory and by the presence of choppers, various types of large and small scrapers (skreblo), and wedge-shaped cores. The second group is represented by industries which show fewer archaic features, except for the notches and denticulates, which are as fundamental a feature of the sites as are the core types and the frequencies of blades. However, these defiined groups of sites were not isolated units in the Western Siberian Upper Paleolithic. There were many complicated and interwoven connections between them and many similarities. This brings us back to Mochanov's concept of the existence in the southwestern regions of Northern Asia of the MaPta-Afontova technocomplex, which would include groups of related cultures (Mochanov, 1977). Thus, we may no longer think in terms of the existence of "two worlds" of the Upper Paleolithic or of a special Siberian cultural area, which was different from Europe in the archaism of its typology and in the basic technology of blank production.
