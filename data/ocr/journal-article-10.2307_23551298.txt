<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON: COMMENTS ON HARVEY WHITEHOUSE'S INSIDE THE CULT AND THE TWO MODES OF RELIGIOSITY THEORY1 Gregory D. Allés Inside the Cult (Whitehouse 1995) is a wonderful book in at least two respects. The first seven chapters present an engaging ethnographic narrative of an eschatological movement that took place among mem bers of a religious community in Papua New Guinea known as the Pomio Kivung. The eighth chapter then seeks to explain significant features of that movement by formulating a vigorous and ambitious theory of two modes of religiosity, which Whitehouse calls imagistic and doctrinal. Whitehouse's two modes of religiosity stand in a line of dualistic classificatory schemes developed during the twentieth centuiy by schol ars such as Ruth Benedict, Jack Goody, and Victor W. Turner, all of which attracted a great deal of attention. The modes link thirteen pairs of variables from a variety of areas to a single causal mechanism, the variation between episodic and semantic memory identified by Endel Tulving (1972). Like many people, I find such schemes intuitively appeal ing, but I also try to approach them with caution. In the case at hand, I very much suspect that Whitehouse has conceived of the operations of episodic and semantic memory too schematically in terms of a sim ple, exclusive pair of opposites—a single, giant on-off switch (cf. Lawson and McCauley 2002). I am also waiting for studies that will provide statistically valid evidence to confirm all of the correlations that White house postulates, along the lines of the careful studies on cognitive con straint done by Justin Barrett and his colleagues (e.g., Barrett 1998b; Barrett and Keil 1996; Barrett and Nyhof 2001; Barrett, Richert, and Driesenga 2001; cf. Barrett 1998a). My fear is that what we will get instead is what previous generations got in James George Frazer's The 1 My thanks to Jeremy Carrette and Ulrich Berner for invitations to present ear lier versions of this essay at the Universities of Stirling, Scotland, and Bayreuth, Germany, as well as to those who commented, sometimes vigorously, at those pre sentations. I am also thankful to Dr. Asonzeh Ukah (Bayreuth) and Dr. Anne Koch (Munich) for written comments. All of the above have helped me tremendously. If I persist in following certain paths, that is certainly not because some people did not try energetically to dissuade me. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2004 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.nl 16, 266-291</page><page sequence="2">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 267 Golden Bough (1911-1915) and Mircea Eliade's Patterns in Comparative Reli gion (1958): long lists of anecdotes that make fascinating reading but that, in a strict sense, contribute nothing to verification or falsification. To a limited extent Whitehouse himself has already set off down this path (Whitehouse 2000). Conceiving and then conducting the necessary studies will require hard work, especially hard given the ambitiousness of Whitehouse's claims, but I will not contribute to that effort here. Instead, I will revisit his ethnographic data, with the aim of developing a complement to his theory. As Whitehouse makes clear, the villagers in Dadul, where the escha tological movement took place, like members of the Pomio Kivung in general, conceive of religious behavior in economic terms. (I use the ethnographic present for convenience; they may no longer do so.) For example, the people to whom the villagers belong, the Mali Baining, do not make a sharp distinction between exchange relations with the ancestors and those with other unseen beings, such as government agents (Whitehouse 1995: 39). In addition, both the Pomio Kivung and the Dadul splinter group nurture a premillenarian vision that is dis tinctly economic. The end of time will begin with the "Period of the Companies," "an era of unprecedented prosperity, which will result from the transfer of knowledge and an industrial infrastructure for the production of technological wonders and material wealth like that of the Western world" (Lawson and McCauley 2002: 90; cf. Whitehouse 1995: 43). It will culminate in the "Period of the Government," when such prosperity will be made permanent. This overlap between reli gion and economics was crucial to the founder of the Pomio Kivung, Michael Koriam Urekit. On the public level, his speeches referred to the material issues that politicians and developmental economists nor mally address. On a more esoteric level, he took up those same issues from a distinctly religious point of view (Whitehouse 1995: 42-47, 2000: 73-74). Indeed, such a conjuncture between economics and religion has been common in Melanesia (Whitehouse 1995: 39, and literature cited there). For example, Andrew Lattas has noted that members of a community in West New Britain used telephones "to make audible the increasingly distant voices of the dead who were enjoying and could bring about the white man's life style" (Lattas 2000: 341). More gen erally, Doug Dalton (2000b, following suggestions by Roy Wagner [1981]) has invited us to see cargo cults generally as a mimetic par ody, in indigenous terms, of the irrationality of the economic behav ior of the Western bourgeoisie.</page><page sequence="3">268 GREGORY D. ALLES I will not engage the question of bourgeois irrationality here,2 just as I will ignore the broader question of whether we should even speak of "cargo cults" (Dalton 2000a; Kaplan 1995; McDowell 1985, 2000; Wagner 1981). Rather, taking encouragement from the conjuncture of religion and economics among the Pomio Kivung and the Dadul splin ter group, I will re-read the ethnographic chapters of Inside the Cult from the perspective of economics informed by cognitive and behav ioral psychology. In doing so, I will take seriously the classical claim that economics does not pass judgment on what people value (Stigler and Becker 1977) but simply explains behavior within worlds as peo ple conceive of them, the worlds in which they make decisions and act. But before I develop my re-reading, I want to make a few more general remarks. In re-reading Whitehouse's ethnography as I do, I will address what others have seen as a defect in his modes of religiosity theory. Thomas Lawson and Robert MxCauley formulate the defect this way: "The ability of the cognitive principles to which Whitehouse appeals to make sense of either why a ritual system might alternate over time between rituals characteristic of the doctrinal and imagistic modes or how the two modes might become 'enmeshed' is entirely unclear" (Lawson and McCauley 2002: 109). But in re-reading Whitehouse's ethnography, I hope to do something more, too. In a recent essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education Robert Wuthnow (2003) singled out cognitive and eco nomic approaches to religion as the two "hardest" approaches in the scientific study of religions today. I find this juxtaposition intriguing, because outside of the study of religions there has been a growing rap prochement between economics and both cognitive and behavioral psy chology (e.g., Fehr 2002: 272; Frederick, Loewenstein, and O'Donoghue 2002: 393-394; Schlicht 1995). I want to suggest that this rapproche 2 Whether and to what extent "cargo cult" behavior is rational, in an economic sense or in any other, is a contentious issue. F. E. Williams brought cargo cults to wider attention under the title The Vailala Madness (1923), and Kenelm Burridge, in his classic book, Mambu (1960), held out hope that Melanesians would one day realize their material dreams through economically rational means (cf. Lindstrom 2000: 297). By the early twenty-first century the term "cargo cult" had become a popular metaphor for misguided, pseudo-scientific behavior (Brown 2001; Hirsch 2002; Lynch 1998). As one would expect, however, many, if not all, scholars with a professional interest in a plurality of human rationalities rejected the judgment that cargo cults were irrational (contra: Dalton 2000b; Wagner 2000).</page><page sequence="4">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 269 ment might be fruitful in the study of religions, too. But to judge from conversations with colleagues, that suggestion requires both preliminary clarification and defense. Any coupling of the words "religion" and "economics" today prob ably suggests the names of Rodney Stark, Roger Finke, and Laurence Iannaccone (e.g., Stark 1996, 2001; Stark and Finke 2000; Iannaccone 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, and, more generally, 1998) and debates over the degree to which religion can be explained in terms of rational choice (Bruce 1993; Iannaccone 1995; Stark, Iannaccone, and Finke 1996; Young [ed.] 1997; Iannaccone, Stark, and Finke 1998; Bruce 1999). This work is certainly worthy of consideration, but what I have in mind differs from it in several respects. First, these scholars, espe cially Stark and Finke, concentrate on competition between firms in a religious marketplace (see also Ekelund et al. 1996). Here, at least, I am not interested in what makes for successful competition between religious groups at a specific time. I am interested in variation within a specific group, the splinter group at Dadul, over time. That move ment is the unexplained variation between Whitehouse's two modes of religiosity. Second, Stark, Finke, and Iannaccone are supply-siders. They assume a constant demand for religion and explain variations in the size of religious groups by appealing to the differing effectiveness with which these groups meet that demand. I find this assumption prob lematic, first of all because I doubt that there is a singular universal "religion" for which there can be a constant demand, for reasons famil iar to most readers of this journal (e.g., Feil [ed.] 2000, Fitzgerald 2000, Saler 2000, and, in a somewhat different vein, Lincoln 2000). More to the point, I am not concerned here with "demand" for "religion" but for specific religious "products," and that demand, so far as I can see, can fluctuate over time just as easily as the demand for olives and hummus. Third, Stark, Finke, and Iannaccone insist upon the economic rationality of religious behavior. But if economic rationality means that on the whole human behavior conforms to normative recommenda tions about optimal behavior that derive from a logical analysis of games, strong evidence suggests that actual behavior is not rational. For example, the Nobel prize in economics for 2002 recognized Daniel Kahneman who, together with Amos Twersky (d. 1996), formulated prospect theory as an alternative to expected utility theory precisely to account for ways in which actual behavior diverges from "rational" behavior in the taking of risks (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1974, 1986; Kahneman and Tversky, ed., 2000; cf. also Thaler 1980, 1992, 1995; Russell and Thaler 1985; and Fehr and</page><page sequence="5">270 GREGORY D. ALLES Zych 1998, falsifying the claims of Becker and Murphy 1988). The present essay is concerned with whether we can give an account of religious behavior, not with whether that behavior is rational. At one point Iannaccone's human capital approach will become relevant to what I say, but only as one of several possibilities. Now I will engage in a little apologetics. In the essay mentioned above, Wuthnow (2003) writes: "Of course, humanistically oriented scholars and many in the social sciences would probably be put off by studies seeking to reduce religious impulses to hard-wired biological or economic concerns." Trained in the hermeneutical tradition of the his tory of religions as I am, I am well aware of this reaction. But being put off by a scholarly pursuit is an intellectual fault. It displays nar row-mindedness. Nothing that I have written here reduces religion to economics or biology, either in the technical sense of the word "reduc tion" that some prefer (Penner and Yonan 1972) or in the looser, pop ular sense that I suspect underlies Wuthnow's observation. In approaching religion as I do, I am not claiming that all of religion can be explained by cognitive science and economics or that cognitive science and eco nomics should stand at the center of religious studies. I am merely claiming that economics and cognitive science have roles to play in understanding religion. Some seem to think that economic analysis is flawed because it oper ates with our terms and questions, not indigenous ones. They may even claim that it improperly forces the rest of the world into a peculiarly capitalistic mold and suggest that it does so for insidious purposes. That is simply wrong. As already mentioned, the conjuncture of religion and economics among the Mali Baining and the Dadul villagers has encour aged me to take the approach that I take here. But I would also insist on a fundamental distinction between, on the one hand, the actual choices that the Mali Baining make, together with the values they hold and the beings they think exist, and, on the other, the extent to which they conceive of those choices in economic terms. The former is at issue here, not the latter. People do not need either to be conscious of or to endorse economic regularities in order to exhibit them. Conscious ness of economic regularities only becomes an issue when people want to manipulate them.3 3 Consider an example from a different context. Many university professors resist the application of economic analysis to their teaching, often for good reason. That does not imply, however, that one cannot explain certain fluctuations in course enrollment through economic models, even if the professors themselves are unaware</page><page sequence="6">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 271 I do find much to agree with when Gavin Flood, for example, writes, "Knowledge is always produced from a social base, though this base is rendered invisible by objectivist science" (Flood 1999: 9), and fur ther, "The dialogical nature of research entails an ethic of practice which reflexively recognizes the contextual nature of research and its implicit values and is sensitive to the power relationship in any epis temology" (Flood 1999: 15). I also concede that orthodox, neoclassical economics has its critics (e.g., McCloskey 1990, 1996, 1998; Cullenberg, Amariglio, and Ruccio [éd.] 2001; more generally, Monaghan 2003); and I myself find much to criticize in economic thought, starting with the virtual identification of three terms severely in need of disam biguation: value, utility, and monetary price (only hints in Alies 2001). At the same time, the contextual embeddedness of all knowledge does not permit anyone to dismiss claims simply because he or she wishes the world appeared different than it does. Just as one cannot reject atomic theory simply because it makes it possible to build extremely powerful bombs, one cannot dismiss claims about human behavior sim ply because they violate one's cherished convictions about the proper distribution of wealth or the culturally, socially, and/or linguistically constructed character of all human behavior. To do so is to abandon scholarship for dogmatics. I am confident that those who know eco nomics better than I do will judge my handling of it as, at best, rudi mentary. Given my training, that is inevitable. If I manage to draw attention to the possibilities of supplementing a cognitive approach to religious thought and behavior with an economic one, I will be satisfied. If others are moved to offer a better analysis, I will be delighted. Adherents of the Pomio Kivung regularly engage in exchange with their ancestors. For purposes of analysis we can distinguish two types of exchange in their activities. Using terms that are colloquial rather than technical, I will call them repeated exchange and term exchange. Repeated exchange involves a series of exchanges of similar goods with a specific set of exchange partners. It includes such behavior as vis iting the same grocery store, bakery, and petrol pump daily, weekly, or at some other periodic interval. It also includes the kind of regularized of or adamantly deny the applicability of those models. Suddenly tripling the amount of work required of students in a class is likely to decrease enrollment. The degree to which it does so reflects the elasticity of demand for the course within the given "price" range.</page><page sequence="7">272 GREGORY D. ALLES exchange relationships found in Malinowski's classic description of the kula ring in Melanesia (Malinowski 1922). Adherents of the Pomio Kivung engage in repeated exchange when they gather on a daily basis to listen to a cycle of sermons on the "ten commandments" (not the ten commandments of the Bible). They also do so when they make regular offerings to the ancestors. That is, at regular intervals mem bers of the Pomio Kivung give their ancestors goods, time, and atten tion; in return they receive forgiveness of sins and a restored relationship with the ancestors. But intertwined with this repeated exchange is term exchange. In term exchange the buyer makes a regular series of payments in the expectation that, at the end of the term, she or he will receive the promised good. Term exchange takes place, for example, when one purchases furniture on lay-away or life insurance. It also occurs when many of my Christian students do what God wants for an unspecified but finite term (their life) in order to receive promised rewards in heaven. The Pomio Kivung promises future rewards from an invisible source, too, but in the form of prosperity here on earth, not life in heaven. Although this prosperity will come in two phases—the Period of the Companies and the Period of the Government—precisely when it will do so is uncertain. Thus, within the Pomio Kivung term exchange ordinarily takes place in the context of what Joel Robbins has called "everyday millenarianism" (Robbins 2001: 526). A month or two before Whitehouse and his wife arrived in Dadul, this everyday millenarianism changed (Whitehouse 1995: 90). A promi nent member of the village, Tanotka, aided by his relative Baninge, began to teach that the return of the ancestors was imminent. This teaching split the Dadul villagers from other members of the Pomio Kivung and, as time proceeded, resulted in an accelerating enthusiasm. Whitehouse suggests that the movement received additional stimulus when he and his wife appeared in the village bearing letters from the government and then started to record everything that the villagers were doing. Villagers took them to be an advance delegation of the returning ancestors.4 Eventually the villagers sent insulting letters to 4 Gananath Obeyesekere (1992) has vigorously disputed whether people living on Pacific islands have actually associated European visitors with supernatural beings. Such claims, he says, are part of a dominant European myth. For a similar argu ment with respect to Melanesian cargo cults, see Lindstrom (1993). This contention has not, however, gone unchallenged. See Sahlins (1995) and Leavitt (2000). The dispute gives us reason to interrogate Whitehouse's claim carefully, but it does not entitle us to reject it without examining the specific evidence. Since I have no</page><page sequence="8">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 273 their neighbors and to the leadership of the Pomio Kivung, effecting a break with outside communities near and far. They spent an increas ing amount of time in ritual activity and simultaneously began to neglect their gardens and crops. They also gave up certain social conventions, such as the wearing of clothing. At the culmination of the movement the villagers slaughtered and ate all their pigs, moved to another vil lage, and held nightly rituals to the point of sheer exhaustion in antic ipation of the ancestors' expected return. Unfortunately, the ancestors did not return, and when the government sent agents to investigate the movement, it found the sanitary conditions among members of the community to be dangerous and forced the Dadul villagers to return home. There they faced the difficulties of repairing relations with their neighbors and rebuilding their lives. The theory of two modes of religiosity focuses upon the formal differences between the Pomio Kivung and the Dadul splinter group. To the extent that Whitehouse accounts for the shift from one to the other, he appeals to emotions, specifically, to feelings of boredom and impatience. Boredom comes from listening every afternoon to the same cycle of sermons on the Ten Commandments. Impatience comes from a desire for the ancestors to initiate the anticipated period of prosper ity sooner rather than later. But this explanation deserves further consideration, for boredom is no more a necessary characteristic of repeated exchange than impa tience is a necessary characteristic of term exchange. For example, for the last fifteen years or so I have repeatedly bought gasoline at regu lar intervals of, say, once a week. I have never been tempted to stop because I found it boring to do so.5 Similarly, I routinely make pay ments on a life insurance policy. I could save myself some money and increase the ratio of monetary benefit to monetary cost if I would just hurry up and die, but somehow I have never been tempted to do that, either. So while Whitehouse's appeal to boredom and impatience makes a certain amount intuitive sense, it leaves some explaining to do. specific reason to doubt Whitehouse's claim, for purposes of this essay I will let it stand. 5 I use examples, often framed in the first person, in order to clarify the gen eral points, not to establish them. Readers whose personal experiences diverge from mine should not reject the general claims simply on that account, but rather fault my imaginative ability in trying to formulate examples. The general claims refer to statistical probabilities, not universal necessities.</page><page sequence="9">274 GREGORY D. ALLES If I had to listen to the same cycle of sermons on a set of command ments for more than an hour every afternoon, I would quickly become bored. But this is actually part of the analytical problem. As Bronwen Douglas (2001: 624, 630) has recently noted, many anthropologists, enchanted by the romance of the exotic, have found quotidian Melanesian religious practices so boring that they have simply not wanted to give them serious attention. From such a standpoint it makes no sense that these practices perdure. Douglas makes her observations primarily about the anthropological study of Christian missions and mainstream Christianity. But they are not without implications for the study of cargo cults, for, as she points out, F. E. Williams long ago speculated about the causative role of boredom in the "Vailala Madness." The Madness, Williams wrote, was "perhaps a product of religious zeal plus boredom" (Williams 1944-1945: 140, cited by Douglas 2001: 624). Zeal plus boredom, impatience plus boredom—have we stumbled here onto a literary trope in the anthro pological writing of Melanesian religions?6 In Arguments and Icons Whitehouse (2000: 44-46) has generalized bore dom into what he calls the "tedium effect." Tedium is allegedly inher ent in the doctrinal mode of religiosity, because it is one of the unfortunate side-effects of the repetition that semantic memory requires. People get tired of hearing the doctrine repeated over and over again. Economists have a name for this tedium effect. They call it diminishing marginal utility. Under conditions of repetition, each successive encounter—each successive sermon on a given commandment—yields a smaller degree of positively valued psychological stimulation. According to the principle of equimarginality, ordinary exchange con tinues until the point when marginal utility balances out marginal cost. At that point, the villagers would find listening to any more sermons so boring that it would just not be worth their effort. In other words, unlike me buying petrol, they would stop attending the sermons. But that does not happen. People continue to listen to repetitive sermons, 6 We cannot, of course, simply dismiss Whitehouse's claim that the villagers of Dadul were bored by the sermons (cf. Fabian 2001), but Douglas does give us rea son to scrutinize it more closely. Perhaps I should confess, too, that I am not per sonally convinced that lack of boredom is always an important factor in assessing the strength of religious life. That could, however, reflect my limited personal expo sure to evangelistic and enthusiastic forms of Christianity and more broadly my limited interest in religion as entertainment.</page><page sequence="10">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 275 despite the apparent boredom, and they do so over an extended period of time. Either the marginal psychological utility of these sermons dimin ishes at an incredibly slow rate for Melanesians or, as seems more likely, people receive other benefits besides entertainment from listen ing to routine sermons. What might those benefits be, psychological and otherwise? How important are they relative to the psychological stimulation upon which the argument from boredom puts so much weight? How much explanatory weight can an appeal to boredom sustain? Whatever the benefits, the Pomio Kivung extends well beyond Dadul village, and I presume that the tedium effect applies equally to all the other repetitive ceremonies of all the other Pomio Kivung communi ties as well. Perhaps Whitehouse wants to advance a case-specific claim: either that levels of boredom in Dadul compared to other communi ties of the Pomio Kivung were so high that the Dadul villagers engaged in the eschatological movement to relieve their boredom, or that the level of boredom had somehow elevated to a crisis point, precipitating the eschatological movement to relieve the strain. But if so, he gives us no evidence. I think it more likely, however, that Whitehouse wants to advance a different claim, namely, that communities which exhibit higher rates of boredom show a greater propensity to eschatological movements—or at least to the kinds of small-scale movements that cor respond to the postulated imagistic mode of religiosity. Obviously, that claim cannot be established on the basis of a single case study, such as Inside the Cult. Before it can be established at all, one needs to be able to measure levels of boredom reliably across communities. In any case, this claim requires some other catalyst or catalysts to supply the stimulus that leads to the emergence of specific movements. It also requires us to look elsewhere if we want, as I do, to account for the courses that they take. So far as I can see, scholars have tended to explain eschatological movements in terms analogous to the economics of substitution. Indeed, with their notion of compensators Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge tried to explain pretty much all of religion in such terms (Stark and Bainbridge 1987). The economics of substitution concerns goods that people substitute for what they would otherwise purchase when the price of the normal good is higher than what they are will ing to pay or when their available resources are too meager (two ways of saying the same thing). For example, when I first began to draft</page><page sequence="11">276 GREGORY D. ALLES this essay, I was living in somewhat straightened circumstances. Although I wanted to buy Augustiner or Franziskaner beer at the grocery for between €0.60 to €0.70 a half-liter bottle, I actually bought Germania beer at the much cheaper price of €0.29 a half-liter can. When my circumstances improved, I occasionally bought more expensive beer. The good that people substitute for a more desirable good that they cannot afford can be called an inferior good. Scholars who do not share a particular religious vision often treat claims about the escha ton (the generic term I shall use for an end-time such as the Dadul splinter group anticipated) as an inferior or substitute good. When peo ple feel that they are relatively well off, their interest in the eschaton decreases. When they feel that they are relatively worse off, their inter est increases. This account is a particular instance of Marx's famous dictum: rich people can afford opium, poor people have to make do with religion. It is also, so far as I can see, a common attitude toward Melanesian eschatological movements. The participants would really like to have Western riches and goods, but since they cannot, and since they show no signs of acquiring the resources actually to procure them any time soon, they make do with religious expectations (cf. the cyni cal comments in The Economist 1991). I do not like this account of religion for a number of reasons,7 but only one of them is really relevant here: treating the eschaton as an inferior good is of no help in explaining the boom and bust scenario that stands at the heart of Whitehouse's ethnography. Whitehouse sug gests, however, another possible path when he speaks about impatience, and that path leads to a consideration of intertemporal choice, expected utility, and the assessment of risks, among other topics. Impatience is an interesting economic problem, although it is inter esting in a somewhat different way than in Whitehouse's account. In both contexts impatience involves excessive short-term consumption despite adverse long-term effects, but for Whitehouse the short-term consumption is of a tremendous magnitude and the long-term effects are not generally anticipated. For economists impatience works the other way around: when given a choice between a smaller benefit received sooner and a larger benefit received later, people tend to choose the smaller benefit (Fehr 2002). This kind of impatience relates directly to contemporary problems like balancing present consumption 7 Not the least of these reasons is that this account makes it impossible for us to understand how people of relatively good social and economic standing can par ticipate in religion to the extent that they do; cf. Collins (1997: 170-171).</page><page sequence="12">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 277 and saving for retirement, but it is hardly a relic of modern capital ism. When presented with similar choices, pigeons exhibit the same tendency as people, although over a much shorter time span (Green, Fisher, Perlow, and Sherman 1981). This kind of impatience may then be broadly characteristic of animal behavior.8 What does it say about eschatological movements such as the one Whitehouse witnessed at Dadul? For the sake of simplicity consider a simple, dyadic model of escha tological expectations whose two poles correspond to Whitehouse's exam ples of doctrinal and imagistic religiosity, the Pomio Kivung and the Dadul splinter group. The Pomio Kivung anticipates what we might call an indefinite eschaton: the desired event is coming, but we do not know precisely when, and it might be a long way off. The Dadul splin ter group anticipates a definite eschaton: the ancestors will return at a specific point in time, and that point is relatively soon. Both of these eschatons, definite and indefinite, are attractive, but they are attractive in different ways. On the one hand, nearness in time makes the definite eschaton more attractive than the indefinite one. On the other, belief in an indefinite eschaton is more attractive because it is less risky. Consider nearness in time first. Like pigeons, people discount utility over time.9 For example, I am very likely to value €1,000 received today more than I value €1,000 to be received 30 years from now. In a short article published almost seventy years ago, Paul Samuelson (1937) formulated the classic model for this discounting, according to which people discount at a fixed rate (simplified version in equation 1). Compared to an eschaton that occurs today, an eschaton that occurs thirty years from now is less valuable by an annual discount coefficient taken to the power of thirty. For example, if the discount rate (r) is 6%, an eschaton that appears thirty years from now is only worth 17.4% ([1/1.06]30) of what the eschaton is worth today. But the escha ton is somewhat peculiar, even for people who equate it with the arrival of goods produced by an industrialized or post-industrial society. Some people might claim that its value is infinite, and multiplying infinity by 8 But some of characteristics that I utilize in this essay are specific to humans, for example, susceptibility to the sunk-cost fallacy (Ayton and Arkes 1998). 9 I mention pigeons in part to make the point that I am not talking about the assignation of numerical value but about behavior to which such value can be assigned by researchers. I very much doubt that pigeons manipulate monetary values.</page><page sequence="13">278 GREGORY D. ALLES any finite number still results in infinity. So one could think of escha tological discounting in the following way instead. When the eschaton arrives, a person receives the sum of all possible goods and services at a particular point in time, indeed, at the final point in time. But unless one receives that package immediately, its value does not actually encom pass the sum total of till possible goods and services. Values are also associated with each period—day, month, year, whatever—that inter venes between now and the end of time.10 The longer the eschaton is delayed, the smaller the proportion that it accounts for with regard to the sum total of all value (see equation set 2). Indeed, much current research suggests that value erodes very quickly over intervals in close proximity to the present. For example, the difference between the val ues I assign to €1,000 received today and €1,000 received a month from now is likely to be much larger than the difference between the values I assign to €1,000 received in 30 years and €1,000 received in 30 years plus a month. (On Samuelson's model these differences should be identical; drawing upon the work of William Ainslee [1992], David Laibson [1997] has modeled actual discounting with a hyperbolic rather than an exponential function; see further Frederick, Loewenstein, and O'Donoghue 2002) As a result, if the eschaton is delayed, its value actually erodes much more quickly than my equations suggest. But intertemporal discounting is only part of the story. Attractiveness is also a function of perceived risk, and belief in an indefinite escha ton is considerably less risky than belief in a definite one. The belief that the world will end some day and that when it does, all things will be well, is unfalsifiable. The actual event can be postponed indefinitely, and the belief can almost count as a certainty. By contrast, the pre diction that on such and such a day, or even in such and such a month or year, the world will end has a much higher chance of being wrong. Indeed, most of the time most of us seem to reason that, if past his tory is any indication—and technically it is not—any single prediction of an imminent eschaton has very little chance of being correct. The orthodox way of approaching such situations is known as expected utility theory, and it suggests that rational agents simply multiply the amount to be gained by the risk co-efficient and choose the option that maximizes benefit. As Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have shown, however, the way people actually perceive and approach such situa tions is complicated, indeed, too complicated to discuss in detail here (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1974, 1986). For convenience I work with discrete rather than continuous time.</page><page sequence="14">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 279 But some features will help us formulate the present problem more precisely and then suggest an answer. Strong evidence suggests that most people, most of the time, feel more strongly about losses than they do about gains. For example, according to some estimates, it is twice as painful to lose an euro as it is pleasurable to gain one (Thaler 1995). As a result, people will be inclined to opt for a small, reasonably certain gain rather than a larger, riskier one. For example, say I face two choices: (a) a 90% chance that I will have enough food to eat for a year, and a 10% chance of starv ing to death, with the possibility of repeating the decision each suc cessive year indefinitely, and (b) a one-time, 35% chance that I will have all the food I will ever need to eat, along with a 65% chance that I will starve to death this year. I am likely to choose (a), although if I hope to live ten years or longer—and at my age I do—(b) would be the better choice. Although Whitehouse invokes impatience to account for the eschatological movement at Dadul, economists might see in that behavior a counter-instance of typical economic impatience. In this case, the villagers have abandoned the small, relatively certain gains that come from tending their crops and engaging in everyday mil lenarianism for what appears to us, at least, as the very risky venture of a predicted eschaton. A number of factors might lead people to do this. One might be what Tversky and Kahneman have called a "bias of imaginability." To quote them: "The risk involved in an undertaking may be grossly under estimated if some possible dangers are either difficult to conceive of, or simply do not come to mind" (Tversky and Kahneman 1974: 1128). Another involves framing. People will react differently depending upon how a scenario is presented to them (Kahneman and Tversky 1984; Tversky and Kahneman 1986; Benartzi and Thaler 1999). If they see it as an opportunity for gain, they will be more inclined to accept it; if they see it as an opportunity for loss, they will be more inclined to reject it. Third, the desires and expectations that people have seem— more precisely, marginal utility seems—to increase in the presence of certain circumstances, which David Laibson (2001) has denoted "cues." Given the right cues, people may be more inclined to disregard the risk involved in various ventures, among them eschatological move ments. In the events at Dadul one such cue may well have been the appearance of Whitehouse and his wife, regardless of what villagers thought them to be (see note 4). Fourth, people tend to underestimate the statistical possibility that certain combinations of events will occur. When they encounter combinations they consider unusual, they may</page><page sequence="15">280 GREGORY D. ALLES read more significance into them than is prudent (Tversky and Kahneman 1974). Fifth, like many objects of religious attention, the eschaton belongs to a class that some have labeled "credence goods," goods that peo ple must believe will be delivered in the future" (Darby and Kami 1973; Hull and Bold 1989; Ben-Ner and van Hoomissen 1991; Adams, Ekelund, and Jackson 2003; Rolleau and BenAbid 2001; Feddersen and Gilligan 2001; Emons 1997). Especially under these circumstances, the more trustworthy the person presenting a scenario is perceived to be, the more likely people will be inclined to act in accordance with it. Students at Harvard seem to be more likely to trust people with "social capital"—"family status, social skill, and charisma" (Glaeser et al., 2000)—and although social capital may be defined differently in Dadul than at Harvard, I suspect similar effects of trustworthiness operate there as well. Whitehouse's description of Tanotka and Baninge sug gests that they enjoyed a high degree of social capital, and one would expect their higher status to make their predictions more credible. Finally, eschatological movements like the one at Dadul introduce group dynamics that economic psychologists sometimes study under the unseemly name of "herd behavior" (e.g., Banerjee 1992, Lux 1995, Shiller 1995). One feature associated with herd behavior is what has been dubbed the "information cascade," the tendency for people to disregard what they think privately—their own doubts, if you will—in favor of what passes for public knowledge (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch 1992; Anderson 2001; Anderson and Holt 1997; Noth and Weber 2003; Hung and Plott 2001). The list in the previous paragraph is only suggestive, not exhaustive. In any case, I am in no position to explain the precise events that led to the eschatological movement at Dadul. I am not working with my own data. But for whatever reasons, people at Dadul did shift from an everyday millenarianism that expected the eschaton to occur some day to one that expected the eschaton to occur at a specific date in the relatively near future. Predictably, as the expected date of the escha ton drew nearer, its value increased (equation 2b), and so did the amount of money, goods, time, conviction, attention, and so on that villagers were willing to commit to it. 11 Life insurance is an example of a credence good. I pay premiums in the belief that the insurance company will pay a benefit when I die. Although I may have good reason to believe that it will do so, I will never actually be able to witness the payoff.</page><page sequence="16">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 281 In important respects, however, the eschaton is unlike ordinary com modities. For one thing, it equals the sum of all available goods and services at the time when it arrives. For another, when it arrives, it effectively marks the end of economic time. Then again, it has never actually occurred. The interaction of these three factors introduces dynamics that are unlike what happens in other cases when demand shifts. Ordinarily, changes in demand result in the establishment of a new equilibrium, but in the case of a definite prediction of the escha ton, the result is a period of intense escalation followed by collapse. One reason escalation occurs is that, as the predicted moment of fulfillment approaches, all intervening value approaches a limit of zero, while the value of the predicted eschaton approaches the absolute sum of all values (equation 2b). The amount that people are willing to com mit to other goods decreases, while the amount that they are willing to commit to the predicted eschaton approaches the limit of their resources. Given the appropriate formulation, they may even be will ing to exchange their lives—that is, to commit suicide—in order to achieve the promised benefits. We might say that demand for a definite, proximate eschaton approaches a condition where it ceases any longer to be a function of price and becomes instead a constant—a vertical line on a standard supply-demand graph. People are willing to pay any price that they think is necessary in order to achieve it. The only con straint lies in the imagination of the people making the promises. Another dynamic effects the escalation, too. Under ordinary conditions human beings seem to have a propensity to over-consume. As a result, under the conditions of late capitalism they often require external stim uli in order to save sufficiently for retirement (Thaler and Shefrin 1981; Thaler and Benartzi 2001). When people expect an imminent escha ton, these dynamics reach an absolute limit. The eschaton represents ultimate, eternal fulfillment and the effective end of economic time. As a result, people who believe that the eschaton is imminent have no incentive to save for the future. As the anticipated eschaton approaches, consumption approaches its absolute limit. But so far, and despite all predictions, the eschaton has failed to occur. Beginning with Leon Festinger's famous book (Feistinger, Riecken, and Schachter 1956; cf. Stone, ed., 2000), what happens "when prophecy fails" has been much studied, but here I am interested only in the intersection of major outlines of Whitehouse's account with contem porary models of economic behavior. Orthodox economics generally works with simple, market-clearing models, that is, with models built on the assumption that the effects of</page><page sequence="17">282 GREGORY D. ALLES changes will occur instantaneously. On such a model the failure of an imminent eschaton to appear would be followed by an immediate col lapse. As the failure became apparent, demand for the definite, prox imate eschaton would approach zero. People would no longer want it at any price. They would wake up, as if from a bad dream, and the activities surrounding the promise of a definite eschaton would cease. The result would be rapid, downward movement in search of an equi librium in terms of the conviction, time, goods, and so on that are expended on relations with the ancestors. In real life several factors complicate market-clearing models. It is a common experience that a substantial prior investment makes people less willing to abandon a commitment that they have undertaken or a purchase that they have made. If I have spent a considerable amount of time and energy on a student at risk, I will be reluctant to throw in the towel, because I do not want all my effort to go to waste. This behavior has been denoted the "sunk-cost fallacy" (Thaler 1980; Ayton and Arkes 1998), a term that refers to most people's inability to sur render a commitment if it means giving up on "sunk costs," costs that have already been incurred. The attractiveness of the sunk-cost fallacy introduces a considerable amount of stickiness into the market-clearing model sketched above. One would expect that once people had expended and consumed an incredible amount in the belief that the eschaton was about to occur, they would be unwilling simply to abandon that conviction. As Whitehouse reports, although members of the Dadul splinter group were disappointed by the first failure, they persisted in their behavior and sought to cover it with ad hoc explanations. When Tanotke and Baninge showed signs of lagging interest and conviction, an alternative leader, Lagawop, temporarily arose to fill the void. The splinter group only abandoned its activities when forced to do so by the government. The subsequent response to this failure was predictable. A small num ber of younger people responded to the collapse by abandoning not just their conviction that the eschaton was imminent but also the beliefs and practices from which that conviction grew, namely, exchange rela tions with the ancestors for forgiveness of sins and belief in an indefinite eschaton. Most, however, did not. To be sure, those beliefs and prac tices are not without their costs, as Whitehouse's tedium effect high lights, but they do not carry anything like the risk of disaster that is associated with a mistaken conviction that the eschaton is about to occur. In addition, the social costs of abandoning these beliefs is quite high in comparison with the costs of continuing to hold them, as</page><page sequence="18">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 283 Whitehouse also makes clear. Iannaccone's (1990) human capital approach provides a nuanced account of these costs. In the case at hand it suc cessfully predicts which people will abandon their prior beliefs and prac tices. But other accounts are possible, too, such as the adaptive preference model that Darren Sherkat invokes in response to Iannaccone (Sherkat 1997: 69-70, 75-76). In addition, I wonder whether something analo gous to what behavioral economists refer to as anchoring (Tversky and Kahneman 1974: 1128-1130) enters into play. Most judgments do not occur in a vacuum; they are influenced by prior knowledge or sug gestion, and the results can be quite surprising. For example, when people spin a number wheel at random and then guess the number of African countries in the United Nations, they tend to guess a lower number of countries when they get a lower number on the wheel, say 20, than when they get a higher number, say, 80. When the eschaton fails to occur, the villagers at Dadul do not suddenly look at the world with pristine eyes. Rather, they look at a world colored by a prior set of assumptions. Their views may diverge somewhat from those assump tions, but they are still defined as movement from an initial starting point. Whatever the explanation, in the short term most of the Dadul villagers generally returned to a more sustainable situation in which smaller, regular, less risky exchanges with the ancestors yielded for giveness of sins and the hope of an indefinite eschaton. I suspect, too, that the failure of the eschaton to appear and the high costs incurred— the destruction of all pigs, the failure to tend gardens, the looting of the gardens by neighbors—led the villagers to frame thoughts about an imminent eschaton in terms of loss rather than gain, making it rather unlikely that eschatological enthusiasm might break out again any time soon. In the long term, however, the specific memory of the events surrounding the movement should degrade, and it will once again become possible to frame an imminently expected eschaton as a major potential gain. So long as eschatological beliefs remain, there remains the possibility that one or more villagers will be struck by the presence of certain cues, that one or more trustworthy people will pro claim that the eschaton is about to occur, and that another period of temporary escalation, followed by collapse, will ensue. In the preceding pages I have re-read the eschatological movement that Whitehouse documents in Inside the Cult in terms of economics, especially behavioral economics. Implicit in my re-reading is a model</page><page sequence="19">284 GREGORY D. ALLES of eschatological movements rooted in a marriage of economics and cognitive as well as behavioral psychology, granted, a different form of cognitive psychology from that which interests either Whitehouse or scholars interested in cognitive constraint (Boyer 1994, 2001; Barrett 1998a, 1998b, 2000). This form of cognitive psychology talks about the way people perceive such things as risk and uncertainty, probabilities, gains and losses. My implicit model entails certain predictions, which I summarize as follows: (1) Given the generality of loss aversion, most people most of the time who entertain expectations of an eschaton will endorse the considerably less risky view of the eschaton as an ill-defined, indefinite certainty rather than as an event predicted for a specific time (Robbins 2001). Given the possibility of reframing potential losses as potential gains, however, it remains possible that people will turn to the belief that the eschaton is imminent. Given that memories lose vividness and impact as they get older, under the proper conditions, such as appropriate cues, it is possi ble that an oscillating rhythm characterized by recurrent eschatological movements will be established. (2) Although the advent of a specifically predicted eschaton may be antic ipated in advance, to the extent that discounting is hyperbolic—or in any case very steep in close proximity to the present, relatively flat at times remote from the present—expenditure for a specifically predicted escha ton will remain close to expenditure for the indefinitely expected escha ton until the time between the present and the anticipated events becomes relatively short. In proximity to the anticipated event, expenditure and consumption will approach as a limit the totality of expenditure and con sumption possible. (3) If the predicted eschaton fails to come about—as has always happened to date—a new equilibrium at a heightened level of expenditure and con sumption will not be established in the long term. Instead, the escalation will give way to an ultimate collapse. But in the wake of the collapse it is likely that people will shift back to a relative equilibrium of religious activity that involves belief in an indefinite eschaton. Honesty requires me to stress that I am no more of an expert on escha tological movements than I am on economics, cognitive psychology, or Melanesian religions. Although these predictions seem intuitively appeal ing to me, they need both theoretical refinement and empirical exam ination. I cannot provide either now. In closing, I simply return briefly to a topic that I have ignored for too long: the implications of my re reading for Whitehouse's postulated two modes of religiosity. What Whitehouse treats as exogenous or independent variables are, in my account, endogenous or dependent ones: namely, episodic and semantic memory. Quotidian transactions that involve belief in an indefinite eschaton or everyday millenarianism either are at relative</page><page sequence="20">SPECULATING ON THE ESCHATON 285 equilibrium or change relatively slowly. They will be encoded in seman tic memory. Movements that arise around specific predictions of the eschaton do not reach equilibrium and will be infrequent and of rel atively short duration. As a result they will tend to be encoded in episodic memory. This mechanism answers a real theoretical need in Whitehouse's account, namely, the need to account for a variation between semantic and episodic memory, and thus between the doctri nal and imagistic religiosities that allegedly arise from the utilization of these forms of memory (McCauley and Lawson 2002: 109). Thus, a consideration of Whitehouse's two modes of religiosity theory adds another prediction to my previous three: in form, religiosity associated with everyday millenarianism will tend to be what Whitehouse calls doctrinal, while religiosity associated with the expectation of a definite eschaton will tend to be imagistic. In itself the different standing of episodic and semantic memory in my re-reading speaks neither for nor against Whitehouse's two modes of religiosity. It is common in the social sciences for the same variables to function endogenously and exogenously in different accounts. The function of the variables depends upon the questions being addressed. But in treating these two modes of memory as endogenous variables, we might also look for some nuance in their operation. What I doubt happens is that the participants in eschatological movements suddenly cross an invisible line at which all events stop being encoded in seman tic memory and start being encoded in episodic memory. Rather, the closer one gets to the predicted eschaton, the larger the number of unique events, and so the larger the number of events encoded in episodic memory. That shift would be most prominent in the hypo thetical situation of a "market" that clears immediately. The more that various sources of stickiness, such as the sunk-cost fallacy, prolong the eschatological movement, the more likely it becomes that certain events will be encoded in semantic memory. These events may be very significant to the movement itself. As McCauley and Lawson have pointed out, it would be hard to imagine that the repeated ring rituals, which were crucial to the movement at Dadul, were ever encoded in episodic mem ory alone. In any case, it is in principle possible to measure the degree to which the events that Whitehouse observed were encoded in seman tic and episodic memory. To the best of my knowledge, that impor tant test of the theory has never been done. In the years since the publication of Rethinking Religion (Lawson and McCauley 1990), the intersection of cognitive science and religion has become an ever more vigorous arena of discussion and an increasingly</page><page sequence="21">286 GREGORY D. ALLES fruitful source of insights into beliefs and practices that we ordinarily call religion. Harvey Whitehouse's thesis about two modes of religios ity has made a major contribution to these discussions, and the very existence of this essay, along with many others, testifies to that contri bution. If there is a subtext to my remarks, perhaps it is Schopenhauerian: the world is not something that we merely conceptualize and remem ber; it is a place where we live. Organisms do not cognize the world for the sheer pleasure of doing so; they cognize the world in order to live in it. I expect that studies of the way in which human beings con ceptualize and remember will continue to enrich our understanding of religion for many years to come. But scholars of religions may also benefit from exploring other forms of cognitive psychology as well. In particular, they might want to explore those forms which link up with economics.
