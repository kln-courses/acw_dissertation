Previous contributors include Stewart Macaulay, John Griffith, William Twining, Carol Harlow, Geoffrey Bindman, and Harry Arthurs. It is quite a task to write about a single book that affected my career and judgement! I confess that I was just a little jealous on reading John Griffith's description of his discovery, while still new to the career, of an author who influenced him for life.2 I would like to have stimulated the reader by using terms like 'turning point' or 'shift'. Heureusement, or perhaps malheureusement, my trajectory appears with hindsight more like that of a long, peaceful river. Not boring, but definitivement linear. To be truthful, I cannot cite just one book that made for a real turning point in my life as a scholar. Unless it was The Alexandria Quartet. That ability to distance himself that led Lawrence Durrell to take up the same tale from various points of view quickly became a constant interest of mine and made The Quartet a bedside companion. It was thus that I began to want to view a single subject - law - from different perspectives. Originally a historian, I moved across to philosophy, then took up a billet in legal theory before, dissatisfied with the latter, moving into the sociology of law. As Griffith would have it, during this pilgrimage I have come across many writings that have truly 'marked' me.

Reading Montesquieu, Pascal, Jean Domat, Grotius, Pufendorf, and other legal thinkers from these centuries made me understand the intellectual roots of our laws and rights. They gave the direction of my efforts firm guidance. During the high years of 'critical legal theory' (1970-80) I also discovered that certain nineteenth-century currents of legal thought had nearly said it all. From within my more recent reading - I confess to being an insatiable reader - I would mention the satisfaction experienced on reading a work which I can entirely recommend: La democratie providentielle (Providential Democracy) by Dominique Schnapper.3 She gives an admirable analysis of a number of tendencies in the field of human rights, especially the search for equality through the realization of multiple rights to benefits provided by the State ('droits-creance'). These have overtaken both the number and power of those abstract rights proclaimed in the first Declarations. She describes in plain terms what consequences there have been for the very notion of citizen- ship. I have found in her work very substantial food for thought. But such is the life of a researcher - I might have said of an 'explorer' - in which, to repeat Antonio Machado's fine aphorism, discoveries are made by going forward. Nevertheless, through my long journeyings as a researcher I owe it to several other writers that I have more particularly thought through and then rethought my own approach to law and its relation to society. It is not at all that I considered myself or found myself exactly in the line of thought of these authors. Their key ideas were exactly opposite to mine. I am thinking particularly of Michel Villey and of Friedrich A. Hayek. Villey's Historical Lessons from Legal Philosophy4 and his The Development of Modern Legal Thought5 with Hayek's Law, Legislation and Liberty6 have not only considerably enriched my own thought but, as I freely admit, have also caused me to take up some firm academic positions. I certainly expected neither of them to join the critical legal studies movement. But my apprenticeship as a critic was considerably advanced through contact with them. Both have successfully denounced the wrong turnings taken by 'modem' legal and political thought, or at least, by its interpretation and implementation. (Philosophers understand by 'modem' the period from the 'Second Scholastic Period'7 through to Kantianism.) These two slayers of the disastrous consequences of modernity had set out on this road from two entirely different disciplines. One was a legal thinker and (neo-)supporter of natural law thought; the other was an economist and epistemologist. But they shared one feature at least; both were pursuing the 3 D.

They sought to know what this other choice and other road would have been, and how we might turn back from the wrong track already taken. It is even possible that they met since Michel Villey's brother, Daniel Villey, the economist, was invited to take part in the work of the Mont-Pelerin Group, a working group chaired by Hayek from 1947 to 1960 which succeeded in advancing neo-liberalism in opposition to the dominant Keynesianism. I owe my development to Michel Villey. I found in his work a matchless blast against dogmatism and legal positivism. Taking this road, I came to see the Code Napoleon in an unexpected light. I came to regard it in general, beyond its undeniable origin in the legislative process, as the fruit of a 'doctrinal' experiment essentially based on tradition, a tradition touched by Reason.8 But this lesson, however fundamental, quickly seemed limited in the opportunities of purpose that it offered. What had affected me most deeply was Villey's 'style', the critical approach that he recommended. Now, since it was based solely on Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, this style seemed unable to push consequences all the way. To take the critique forward implied taking new avenues. It was here that my path ran into the work of Louis Althusser and Etienne Balibar, Claude Levi-Strauss, Michel Foucault, Georges Mounin, and Gilles-Gaston Granger. These kept company with my next enquiries. I now came to see the French Code Civil as part of the rules of the game of the pax of bourgeois society.9 It took me a good two decades looking for a promising horizon before I got over a certain disappointment and understood the real importance of Villey's teachings. I used those decades to get to know the work of legal sociologists, notably those in Italy, Germany, Britain, and North America. Without Villey, I would probably never have discovered as richly as it deserves the significance of the trilogy published by Friedrich A. Hayek. This work allowed me to remake contact with legal and political thought without seeming to distance myself from the preoccupations of the age. Thus, I was able to turn with more energy towards a study of the meaning of the radical transformations brought on by the process of globalization, of the impact of this process on the laws of nations, and of the march towards what might be a global system of law. We are no longer at the point where we can imagine running a changing society with 'makeovers' ('replastering' in Villey's original French), that is, adaptive responses made now and then to meet social, technological, economic, and financial shifts.

The contemporary relevance of a combined reading of Villey and of Hayek seems to me to be threefold: relevance for method, for a conception of legal order, and for the fundamental values underlying the political organization of society. METHOD Michel Villey invites us to understand 'the nature of things' on the basis of observation. Citing Aristotle, he liked to take the beehive as the example of society. In Villey's opinion the beehive is the prototype of all social organization. I was always asking him to remember the sad fate awaiting the drone after mating with the queen bee, but Villey thought this no more than my little joke! In the hive every bee has its predetermined place and role, so that the whole may function correctly and perpetuate itself. Hayek, on the other hand, dismisses such an animistic and anthropomorphic vision of society. In Hayek's opinion not only does this vision not reflect reality, it is also the basis of totalitarianism. Hayek belongs to that tendency that sees a direct connection between society and socialism. That is why he prefers to write of an 'extended order of human cooperation'. Whilst in his writings Villey does not disguise his preferences, proclaiming himself to be an Aristotelian and a Thomist, this is not the case with Hayek, who is no natural law theorist. Rather, he considers Cicero to be one of the most important precursors of liberal thought. So, on one side Villey criticizes subjectivism, which he sees as responsible for having introduced a disastrous transformation, towards the end of the Second Scholastic Period, in the meaning of the word 'law'. Held to be, up to that point, 'the just relation between things', law thence becomes a 'capacity'.?1 This 'capacity' is the origin of subjective rights. As Dominique Schnapper shows, of these subjective rights, individuals have tended to retain only their character of claims on the state.1 And, for Villey, here - along with positivism and scientism and their triumph in the nineteenth century - lies the origin of the wrong direction taken by the societies in which we live. For his part, Hayek rejects any vision claiming that within social phenomena can be seen universal and recurrent regularities, developmental laws that can be exploited to predict the future. He labels this perspective as historicist. If Hayek also dismisses scientism, it is not because it has been responsible for the disappearance of law as 'ars'. He dismisses scientism for having imposed a belief, erroneous in his eyes, in the heuristic character of the application within the social sciences of the language and method of the 10 Translator's note: 'facultY' in the original, rendered here as 'capacity'. 11 'Droits de creance', Schnapper, op. cit., n. 3. 444 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="5">natural sciences. And this misdirection is attributed to what Hayek terms 'constructivism'. One of the really interesting features of Hayek's critique lies in the fact that he does not consider that he is writing strictly from within economics nor politics. Hayek asks questions about the future of humanity. The origins of his struggle lie within knowledge. He notes that our modes of production of rules are becoming disastrous and wonders what sort of regulation would be appropriate for society. This leads him to investigate the basis of this wrong direction, which he terms the fundamental intellectual error, our mistaken understanding of the world, and our faulty knowledge. Hayek regards these mistakes as dating from the moment a choice was made in favour of a mode of thought which he terms 'constructivist rationalism'. He locates the origin of this in Descartes.12 Not to admit, as the logical conclusion of this line of thinking would have it, that humans owe all their success to the product of human rationality implies rejection of the role played by history, tradition, and customs. In reality - a fundamental issue for consideration - if we express this in epistemological terms, we would speak rather of the Cartesian position in positivist terms rather than of constructivism. Positivist epistemology is in effect based on axioms that do not allow us to cross the gap that exists between law and the social sciences. Ontologically, positivist epistemology postulates both the duality of subject and object, and the reality of the real. Several major principles flow from this ontological position - most notably the principles of exclusion, subsumption,13 dispensation,14 and of non-contradiction. In law, this means that the number of sources of law is determinate and finite; that these sources form a hierarchy; that a lower source contradicting a higher source will be eliminated; and that sources of the same status level may not contradict one another. Moreover, following the determinist postulate, also a basis of positivist epistemology, what is real may be known, and the universe follows laws that we simply need to discover in order to arrive at perfect knowledge. This gives rise to the idea that, just as in the physical world, law emerges from a coherent 'programme', a programme that presided at its creation; and to the idea that past and future dissolve into an eternal present governed by a legislator using whatever state of knowledge is available. Changes in the law, which - from this point of view - can only be for the better, derive from what is termed progress. As for legal knowledge, since it is formed by information on what constitutes the object of law, it will likely evolve in step with improvements in the quality of information. 12 See the first volume of his trilogy. 13 'Subsomption' in the original French text. 14 'Derogation' in the original. 445 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="6">To talk of 'constructivism'15 in contemporary terms is to make reference to a completely different perspective.16 Bachelard had already written that nothing is given, that everything is constructed.17 Constructivism is born at the moment when it is accepted that problems are not necessarily posed a priori, but that they have to be constructed.18 Henceforward the question becomes how can knowledge itself create the conditions and instruments of knowledge? Otherwise expressed, with intelligence organizing the world as intelligence organizes itself, knowledge becomes the actualization of possibilities, or the creation of new possibilities. Beyond the reappearance of the idea of 'end' in epistemology, we find new postulates suggested, replacing those that underpinned the positivist epistemological edifice. In this way, constructivist epistemologies counter the postulate of the reality of reality with the principle of the representability of experience. Knowledge now appears as a quest for an 'appropriate' way to behave and to think. The purpose of reasoning is therefore to arrive at an adequate solution following the principle of 'what is most satisfying' in the sense of the 'satisficing' criterion of Herbert A. Simon. This in turn allows us to imagine the possibility of many different rationalities. In its own turn, the principle of intelligent action, opposing that of least action, leads to the invention or development of an action or strategy for action based on proportionality between the situation as perceived and the response envisaged. Any decision taken in line with this principle will become a deliberation in favour of inventing strategies for action appropriate to the author of the response. Knowledge is no longer that of an object and its objectivity; within the perspective of interaction between object and subject it becomes knowledge of a project for response, what is termed the principle of projectivity. But Hayek would also have been opposed to that sort of constructivism. 15 We should really speak of 'constructivisms' in the plural since we can today identify several families of constructivist epistemologies. Most notably we have, in their French versions: epistemologie de la conception (H.A. Simon), epistemologie de la complexit6 (Edgar Morin), epistemologie inforgetique (G. Bateson), epistemologie tectologique (A. Bogdanov), epistemologies constructivistes radicales (E. von Glasersfeld). 16 In epistemology, constructivism is born out of Piaget's genetic epistemology. Noting that law is a system of rules (logique et connaissance scientifique), Piaget wrote that this system is not available to scientific knowledge in the strict sense of the term (nomothetic science) since rules arise not from what is true or false but from codified sets of values. Piaget suggested that in order to explore relationships between rules and societal phenomena we should develop a sociology of law in order to make a nomothetic study of rules, especially of their genesis and to the exclusion of issues of validity which is the subject of law itself. 17 G. Bachelard, La formation de I'esprit scientifique (1983) 14. 18 The anthropologist Louis Assier-Andrieu attributes to Hoebel the insight that 'a social rule is also constructed by the observer' (citing A.E. Hoebel, The Law of Primitive Man, A Study in Comparative Legal Dynamics (1954) 6-11). 446 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="7">He was a convinced adherent of a moderate methodological individualism that avoided basing itself on individual rationality. Instead, his methodological individualism allowed the deduction of laws conceived as objective and ready to permit the vision of a world consciously and permanently under construction. If social phenomena are determined by the actions and behaviours of individuals, at least these individuals are never fully conscious of the role that they play. For Hayek, most great human achievements are the result neither of consciously directed thought nor of deliberately coordinated effort. While remaining opposed to behaviourism Hayek believes, above all, in experience, particularly the experience of generations, that totality of sensations anchored in memory and transmitted by language. To learn through experience is, says Hayek, a process that begins with the observance, diffusion, transmission, and development of practices that have prevailed because they were a success. THE NOTION OF LEGAL ORDER From all this can be understood the notion of legal order that Hayek made so much his own. Reflection on Hayek's formulation is appropriate, given the disqualification by contemporary thought of the notion of legal order inherited from 'modern' thinkers. The obligatory questions are: does a 'spontaneous order' really exist? What does this sudden interest in a 'nomos' really mean? What conclusions can be drawn from the latter concerning a universalist vision of global order? What definition of equity flows from this? What consequent role could be devolved to the State in some future? Hayek gives a defintion of order that Michel Villey would not have rejected, especially when he notes that social life is marked by a certain order, a coherence, and permanence. Coming from the observer of natural order, from the order that derives from the nature of things, this should not surprise us. But for Hayek, it is not a question of something static. He calls this order spontaneous, or even self-generating. Indeed, in his third volume (published at the end of the 1970s), he favours the expression 'self- organizing structure' and developments in systems theory. Would the theory of autopoiesis allow us to take Hayek's line of argument further? The question is worth studying. The importance of the notion of spontaneous order - a middle way between nature and artifice - is fully visible in a world undergoing globalization. Spontaneous order is order that is not created by an external agent. It is formed out of the adaptation of its individual constituent elements to circumstances affecting only some of them. No element needs to know all the pertaining circumstances. Moreover, we can only know abstract characteristics of this order, without having the least possibility of acting on them. Thus, this order is the result of human action but not human design. This order has not been 'constructed', wished for, foreseen. Hayek's order 447 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="8">differs radically from the natural law positions which, with their foundation in the idea of a programmed universe, an idea characteristic of positivist epistemology, argue for an unknown order of the human brain that could, nevertheless, be revealed by the accumulation of findings. A timeless myth, indeed! Money and markets are two archetypes of spontaneous order. Villey removed money and markets from his analysis because he wanted to write at a philosophical level; but did Aristotle and St Thomas Aquinas write solely about abstractions? With money and markets as the point of departure, the analysis offered by Hayek is an aggressive one, whilst Villey remains on the defensive. First, this is a door opening onto a political system with a minimal State, even if, as issues are developed, Hayek does not appear passionately devoted to such minimalism. Indeed, because spontaneous order is essential to the maintenance of society, it should not be upset. It follows that any 'order' created by an organization (in fact, by the State) should not be able to interfere with spontaneous order. A number of questions emerging from this invite more research. Is this spontaneous order not an ally of historicism - itself a view explicitly rejected by Hayek? And what justifies the prohibition against interfering with spontaneous order? Is it not, on the contrary, for the State, as the agent of the individuals who form a social grouping, to frame this order so as to foster respect for it, or going totally in the other direction, to limit some of its potentially dire effects? It is here that the idea of 'nomos' comes in. It is not an idle remark to observe that this concept of 'nomos' plays a central role in many works of legal and political thought. The idea is found at the same time in three authors representing differing points of view - Villey and Hayek and also Carl Schmitt.19 For Villey, 'nomos' should be contrasted with 'dikaios'. 'Nomos' is what is rule-governed (laws, for instance), in contrast to 'dikaios' (what is just). So, law as a body is referred to in classical writing as 'to dikaion'. Such law is Juristenrecht, expertly hand-made, the product of jurisprudence and case-law. Now, this is what Hayek calls 'nomos' in contrast to 'thesis' (which is Villey's 'nomos'). Finally, for Carl Schmitt 'nomos' is the principle of calculation on which all later measures are based. It is following this 'nomos', fundamental order, the first phenomenon of territorial distribution, the vital principle and source of legitimation for all legal order, that the original division of space has come about. In the eyes of Schmitt, if 'nomos' has later come to mean rule creation it is because rule creation, by virtue of what precedes it, is necessarily tied to the localization of space. The interest presented by this reminder, as by common usage of the expression 'rule creation', comes from the fact that the current problem of the world can be approached outside of any legal positivism. In the opinion 19 C. Schmitt, Der Nomos der Erde im Volkerrecht des Jus Publicum Europaeum (1988). 448 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="9">of Schmitt, 'nomos', in Villey's sense, dates not from classical times but from the interpretation of nineteenth-century positivism. A more distant and tangential question emerges, beyond any interest (as an aid to careful reading) that might be found in the identification of the unique and competing meanings of these writers. This question concerns the appropriateness of a distinction between a common (universal?) order and any particular order artificially constructed by the legislator, dictated in sovereign fashion, and tied to one territory. This might allow us, for example, to appreciate the distance between the universalist claims of 'moder' philosophy and the contemporary process of globalization.20 Contrary to the latter, moder philosophy was able to reach universal conclusions regarding the basis of the idea that norms of behaviour are etched into the heart and reasoning of every individual. The body of observations on legal pluralism that sociologists of law have so far achieved finds an echo here. It has been shown often enough that, alongside State law, other orders (or systems) of law exist. And these other orders spring up more or less spontaneously - though opposite to Hayek's spontaneous order - as necessary, in circumstances that State law can not fill. There are now classic analyses of, among others, Boaventura de Sousa Santos on legal relationships in the favelas of Brasil, Sandra Burman and Wilfried Scharf on the resolution of conflicts in apartheid South Africa, and Christine Harrington on what she calls Shadow Justice. As a whole, these writers wanted to shake the faith of lawyers in the existence of a single and totalizing State legal order in matters of social regulation. Now, if we push further into the interpretation of the existence of these legal orders paralleling State law, we must ask even deeper questions. Are these orders not, in fact, the (spontaneous) expression of a wish to participate directly in the management of certain situations? State law might then well appear to be essentially a balancing tool, used within a precise context and through the legitimate representation of the social group in question, rebalancing the distortions inevitably produced by the spontaneous character of participation in social life.21 20 This is a theme of my book, Entre modernite et mondialisation. Cinq leqons d'histoire de la philosophie du droit et de l'Etat (1998). 21 This interpretative prism would be useful in looking at the mass rapes conducted by order of certain tribal leaderships, and recently condemned by the international community. 449 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="10">POLITICAL ORDER AND ITS FUNDAMENTAL VALUES Certain themes present in Villey, in Hayek, as in all thinkers tackling the issue of law, recur like leitmotivs. These are equity, democracy, and human rights. Equity is not a new notion introduced, or reintroduced, by neo-liberal thinkers in their attack on government abuse and in the quest for a mathematical equality between individuals, at least within the welfare state.22 In the western legal tradition equity has always been considered to be the foundation of law, with reference to natural law and thence to reason. Moreover, it is this conception that has introduced a kind of assimilation of custom into equity. In contrast to systems of Romano-canonical law, common law is the very arena in which equity plays the weightiest role in the creation and interpretation of law. With the rise of neo-liberal thought, it is true that equity has become a point of reference in the regulation of areas undergoing globalization. Indeed, this process inevitably leads to a weakening of the unifying obligations held towards other members of the same small group. We should therefore admit that the advances in social justice achieved by states are merely the remains of a bygone tribal era. We must ignore the appeals of the limited group in order to advance deliberately towards a global society, what Hayek terms a society of 'free men'. As for the return to universalism: it is only by extending spontaneous order and by divesting rules, rules that can not be universalized, of their obligatory character that the world will assume an order of universal peace. Social injustice? Certainly, any game played according to rules can never treat the players justly. But this has nothing to do with equity. Equity is achieved as soon as there is an identical treatment of all in accord with the abstract rules of fair play.23 As for equality of opportunity, this is limited to the declaration of equal treatment before the law. Thus, in the context of spontaneous order, neo-liberal equity is intolerant of what we may call 'social justice'. The latter is a simple mirage (the subtitle of volume two of Hayek's trilogy). Other values: democracy and the respect for human rights that flows from democracy. There is a very great similarity between the basic principles of moder, rationalist natural law doctrine (and these led to the various declarations of human rights) and those adopted by Hayek. For Hayek, peace, freedom, and justice are the principles underlying a democracy. When he ventures to supply a model constitution for a real democracy, within an 'open society of free men', to use his own words, he affirms that the basic 22 Compare A.J. Araud, 'Equity' in International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences (2001). 23 Translator's note: 'juste conduite'. The term 'fair play' used here tends to have greater resonance. 450 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="11">clause would be that humans could not be prevented from doing what they wanted, nor constrained to do certain things, except in accordance with spontaneous law. Peace, freedom, and justice are 'negative' values. This means that their protection requires the pronouncement of prohibitions against what would hinder them. They are indispensable foundations of civilization, and the only ones that the State must guarantee through the use of its power of restraint against those who seek to spoil these foundations. As freedom is a product of civilization, it is appropriate to maintain discipline, discipline in the sense of a system of rules of behaviour. Based on these premises, democracy appears to be the sole means yet discovered by humankind for a peaceful change of government. In virtue of this, democracy is infinitely precious even if not, by a long way, the highest political value. Every democracy is stalked by the possibility of not knowing where the limits are, and the disastrous consequences are easily imagined. It is here that Hayek lets himself go with a discussion of the 'pernicious' principle of parliamentary sovereignty bequeathed to the world by Great Britain along with 'the precious institutions of representative government'. Hayek believes in a democratic ideal conceived as a procedure for determining government decisions within the limits that he confers. These sometimes lively observations join those of commentators who recognize the dangers stalking parliamentary democracy in countries following the welfare-state path. As with freedom and justice, democracy risks being severely threatened by the wish to give the notion a positive content. Once again we return to the problem of needing to achieve balance between participation and representation in the passing of legislation. Decisions on common problems should be taken by the shared opinion of a majority of citizens, and not by interest and pressure groups that many representatives feel unable to refuse. I willingly affirm that the course of my research has been influenced by the reading of these works.24 Most importantly, a multi-disciplinary approach has proven fully justified. How would it be possible to broach issues in the sociology of law without reference to the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of behaviour and institutions? The specific areas of research in the sociology of law have been transcended. Beyond the essential activities of observation and analysis, we should question the too frequent rejection of 'grand theory'. Humility should certainly be the constant of academic research. But, having made observations in the smallest areas of research in the field, how could we not wonder about the totality of findings. The smallest observation deserves to find its place in a general consideration. Taking only some of the examples with which I am familiar, I 24 Although quite far from the core theories presented by their authors. Compare, for example, my book Gouvernants sans frontieres. Entre mondialisation et post- mondialisation (2003, forthcoming). 451 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page><page sequence="12">would say that this general consideration will be concerned with participation and social movements, with governance and the new models of how legislation may be produced, and consequently with the crisis of representative politics, even unto a questioning of the social contract that binds our societies to their particular state. This is nothing less than to turn our backs on Hobbes, Locke, Hume, and Rousseau. In the area of inter- national relations, it is Grotius who should be re-examined. And so over to the younger generations! I have one vivid memory. Just a month before his death, at a meeting in a seminar on the teaching of legal philosophy, Michel Villey confided to me, 'In the end, Arnaud, you are my only true follower'. That was where my real thinking began ... 452 ? Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003</page></plain_text>
