There are two major turning points in Wiechert's career: the first, his con- version from the despairing iconoclasm of his youth to a system of values predi- cated upon human dignity, and faith in the healing and self-perpetuating forces of nature; the second, the violent collision of his ideology with fascism, his reaction to the suffering and misery of Nazi persecution and the Second World War. Fries, in his well written and - from the standpoint of Christian theology - closely argued pamphlet, is primarily concerned with refuting the atheistic ten- dencies increasingly evident in this latter period, particularly in Das einfache Leben and Die Jerominkinder. From these works Fries draws five theses, ranging from Gottes zweifelhafte Haltung bei Seegefechten to Gott ist tot, and against these he directs his attack. The essence of Fries' criticism is that Wiechert is guilty of anthropomorphic and anthropocentric thinking. From the human, relative, limited viewpoint, a world in chaos and the murder of innocents may appear to support Wiechert's theses. But, argues Fries, the evils he decries are the work of man or the devil, not of God. At the most they are the result of man's freedom of choice, bestowed on him by God, the liberty to choose evil as well as good. Quite rightly Fries sees in Wiechert's preoccupation with this problem an indication of his deep desire to find God. His atheism is born of love; he is a Christian in spite of himself. His apparent loss of faith in the face of catastrophe is doubly unfortunate because of the persuasive eloquence with which he proclaims his views. Countless others in similarly tragic circumstances have found faith, but few of these have been able to give their experience equally forceful expression. University of Wisconsin. -J. D.
