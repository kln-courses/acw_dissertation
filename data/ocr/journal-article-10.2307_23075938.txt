<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAURA E. PARODI TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM Abstract The two pages from the Late Shahjahan Album (Mughal India, circa 1650-58) discussed in this essay contain allegorical portraits of the first two Mughal rulers, Babur and Humayun, surrounded by elaborate figurai borders. This detailed icono graphie analysis raises issues of broad relevance for understanding the processes involved in creating Mughal albums as well as their informing principles and their place in relation to the Persianate album tradition. It addresses atelier practice, authorship, the way allegory was conceptualized in the Mughal context, the roles of landscapes and jewels in allegorical Mughal portraits, the relative chronology of Late Shahjahan Album pages, the function of Mughal albums, and the relevance of studying literature to recognizing the processes involved in creating and appreciat ing such works of art. More specifically, it argues that existing scholarship, concerned for the most part with a preliminary categorization of the styles associated with individual peri ods, patrons, or painters, has necessarily focused on the recurrent iconographie themes of Shahjahani painting, and the ensuing narrative has possibly induced the misleading impression of overwhelming repetition, as opposed to the endless vari ations that probably dominated contemporary perception, in a complete parallel with literature. Some further directions are suggested for research that could pro vide additional insight into the connections between literature and painting. But internal difference Where the meanings are — Emily Dickinson THE RECENT EXHIBITION Muraqqa: Imperial Mughal Albums from the Ches ter Beatty Library, Dublin (presented at various locations in the United States in 2008 and in Dublin in 2010) has provided scholars and the general public with an unprecedented opportunity to study and appreciate one of the worlds richest collections of seventeenth-century Mughal album pages. In the related catalogue, Elaine Wright and others not only contribute the most comprehensive discussion to date of a few particular albums, but for the first time they also address questions relevant for understanding Mughal albums as a broader phenomenon. Over the past years I have been developing ideas on the subject myself, most notably on the so-called Late Shahjahan Album (hence, LSJA) as well as on the ori gins of the Mughal muraqqa. Wright's pioneering effort now allows some of these ideas to be put in context.1 In this paper, I shall discuss two of the most complex LSJA pages and provide remarks of a more general scope in the process. 267</page><page sequence="2">1 Page from the LSJA (ca. 1650-58) with a posthumous portrait of Babur (ca. 1640?) in an idealized landscape.

In her 1992 book on Mughal painters, Amina Okada discusses two album pages with posthumous portraits of the early Mughal rulers Babur and Humayun (figs. 1 and 2).2 (The portrait of Babur is in the Musée Guimet, Paris, while that of Humayun is in the collection of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Insti tution, Washington, D.C.) The pages feature borders associated with the so-called LSJA, ascribed to the Mughal imperial atelier in the last years of Shahjahan's reign (circa 1650-58), and possibly were once part of more than one album.3 While Okada's argument in favor of an attribution of both principal images to Payag (who signed one of them)4 remains undisputed, her suggestion that the pages were originally paired5 was recently disproved. Wright's comprehensive examina tion of surviving LSJA pages demonstrates that openings, in this most pictorial of albums, were designed in compliance with the principles of bilateral symmetry (qarïna) that are characteristic of Shahjahani art and architecture.6 In this case, she convincingly argues that the figures in the outer borders differ significantly in size, posture, and placement, and therefore the pages could not have constituted a pair.7 268 LAURA E.

Sackler Gallery, S 1986.400. 2 While endorsing this view, which disproves my original assumption, I still con sider it fruitful to examine the two pages together. Their main images not only are by the same hand but also represent variations on a single theme, that of a ruler sitting in an idealized landscape and holding a jewel in his hand. As scholarly insight into albums progresses, it is increasingly clear that such variations were the norm rather than the exception, and they were one of the means by which the specific narrative of albums unfolded.8 These two paintings may well be chance survivors from a larger group of "dynastic pictures," conceived together and subsequently "reconfigured" for inclusion in one or more albums, whose initial connection would not have been lost on the viewer. In their turn the borders allow comparison of the way different art ists responded to similar images, and thus they provide glimpses into atelier practices that are potentially applicable to other LSJA pages, if not to Mughal albums at large. The Main Images My attention was first drawn to the page now in the collection of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery due to a rather unusual feature: Humayun is sitting close to a young TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="4">plane tree that appears to have regrown after being cut back (fig. 2). A large plane tree (occasionally a poplar) is frequently included in Timurid paintings from the late school of Herat, where it might depict actual settings.9 In paintings produced by later schools, the inclusion of a plane tree is usually interpreted as a manner ism—a relic of, or a quotation from, the Timurid style—but in this case, because of its curious appearance, I would suggest it designates something more specific, namely, the Timurid lineage itself. In Persian as in other languages a genealogi cal "tree" (Pers. derakht) stands for a family, clan, or dynasty. The plane may have been chosen for its perceived connection with the Timurid homeland as well as for its longevity and potentially majestic proportions—qualities of which the Mughals were well aware.10 The continuing importance of trees for Turkic peoples even after Islamization should not be overlooked. In the dream foretelling the fortune of his descendants, Osman visualizes his lineage as a large tree—possibly a plane—whose shade "compassed the world."11 My reasons for making this connection have to do with another detail in the painting: the sarpïch, a headgear ornament held by Humayun, appears in a form common in the mid-to-late seventeenth century rather than the sixteenth. The art ist's main aim here is not historical accuracy, and for its part, the emperors like ness, closely modeled on a portrait painted during his lifetime,12 is endowed with a sensible black egret sarpïch.13 The jewel in Humayun's hand is a different matter, as is shown by comparing it with other seventeenth-century "allegorical portraits" of deceased or living Mughal rulers. Alternating with other royal attributes, such as the crown, the sarpïch would seem to symbolize the transmission of power from one member of the Timurid lineage to another.14 Examples are plentiful, and the equally numerous objects used may well convey subtly different meanings—an issue worthy of further consideration. Indeed, once this principle is acknowledged, all images of rulers or princes "inspecting," "presenting," or "receiving" jewels (to or from their offspring or officers) acquire additional interest.15 On the basis of this combined information, we may plausibly hypothesize that the young tree beside Humayun represents the Timurid lineage, whose florescence in the Subcontinent—to pursue the vegetal metaphor—was severed by the Sur takeover in 1540 (symbolized by the cut-off trunk) and restored several years later, with Humayun's return to Delhi in 1555 (represented by the tree's new growth).16 More specifically, the image may be interpreted as a celebration of the Timurids' final triumph after their temporary setback, whereby royalty (mulk, here signified by the sarplch) was "restored" to their lineage (derakht, the tree). The idealized set ting consequently may be inferred to represent Hindustan. The connection with Humayun's temporary loss of the throne of Hindustan from 1540 to 1555 is reinforced by another curious detail: at variance with customary LAURA E.

A. 17, fol. 15a. 3 practice that was duly adhered to in Babur's case, Humayun is shown seated on bare ground rather than on a folded felt rug.17 This apparent lapse in etiquette can be linked with at least two instances recorded in the chronicle written by Jawhar Aft abchi when Humayun actually found himself with nothing to sit on.18 A possible visual parallel may be found in a contemporary painting ascribed to Dust Muhammad (also known as Dust-i Diwana), datable to circa 1546, and later mounted in Jahangir's Gulshan Album (fig. 3), where the customary para phernalia of royal receptions—a carpet, cushions, and possibly a raised seat for the ruler—are rendered in solid rock. The painting records a historical event but is replete with allegorical and literary references.19 Although the "rock paraphernalia" in that instance might possibly allude to the hardship experienced by Humayun, the impression prevails of his figure being cast as Gayumarth, the mythical ruler of Iran, probably with an allegorical intent. In seventeenth-century Mughal art, we should expect similar processes to be at work, as it increasingly becomes clear patrons demanded paintings be more than mere descriptions, whether of histori cal events or of individuals. For this reason, the absence of a carpet in this painting should not be overlooked. The two portraits otherwise mirror each other closely. They are consistent in size and were similarly enlarged to fit within the standard borders of the LSJA. In a process known from other seventeenth-century paintings, some archaizing 271 TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="6">4 A Likeness of Shah Tahmasb, by Sahifa Banu. Mughal, early 17th century. Victoria and Albert Museum, London (Wantage Bequest, no. 27). 4 features are introduced to infuse them with Timurid flavor:20 a (now-tarnished) silver stream bordered by boulders and plants, a conventional mountain backdrop crowned by stylized trees, and a gold sky with clouds reminiscent of Chinese qi. Both Babur and Humayun appear with haloes, indicating their dignity as divinely ordained rulers. Each holds a jewel in his hand, and in both cases a tree figures prominently beside them. While these paintings are in many ways unique within the surviving LSJA corpus, parallels may be suggested with other seventeenth-century Mughal works that help us trace some of the artists' potential sources of inspiration. Among these is the closely similar composition (minus the mountain back drop) that characterizes another imaginary portrait of a ruler in an earlier seventeenth-century Mughal album. This painting, executed under Jahangir, is now in the Wantage Album in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. It is inscribed as shabih-i Shäh Tahmäsp, raqm-i Sahifa Bänü (fig. 4).21 Only the clothes are after a sixteenth-century Safavid model;22 the remaining features are seventeenth-century Mughal. Payag's pictures are doubtlessly more ambitious, but their close resemblance to Sahifa Banu's work suggests a common source of inspiration, if not direct filiation. A certain similarity is also apparent with a figurai shamsa inscribed as the work of Bihzad, preserved in an anthology copied in Herat in 1524 (fig. 5).23 The manuscript, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, was at one time in the imperial Mughal library and therefore potentially LAURA E.

Similar hillocks recur in various seventeenth-century "allegorical group portraits" of Timurid rulers, and it may be no coincidence that they serve as a backdrop for images unfolding dynastic discourse. Whether through an allusion to a physical landscape (the Timurid homeland, which lay beyond mountain ranges), or by reproducing con ventions typical of Timurid painting, or both, they convey an atmosphere that is as Timurid as could possibly be achieved at that time. Only the lush vegetation bears the imprint of Payag and the hallmark of its time,25 but it is there for a purpose. On closer look, the meadow is in its turn revealed as more than a landscape notation: fertility, abundance, and wealth must be implied, in a close parallel with the setting of Shahjahan's early audience halls and their cypress-like columns and lavish floral carpets.26 Significantly, the boundaries of the lush green area, which contrast sharply with the barren mountain backdrop, are not outlined on the basis of illusionary principles, but instead rise up to encompass the emperors' hands and the jewels they hold, in a remarkably effective visualization of the idea that prosperity emanates from the royal person. The fact that the stream in both cases circles around the rulers' bodies—creating an "island" around them—is also rather unusual. (In the Bihzad roundel, the stream bends but does not form a circle.) This 273 TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="8">deviation from standard iconography on the part of the painter may have been intended to convey some specific meaning, but I am unable to make a precise sug gestion at this stage. In addition, the jewel in Babur s hand is a bäzüband, an ornament worn on the upper part of the arm and is believed to grant victory in battle.27 If we accept the idea that it also conveys some meaning, it may refer to the conquest of Hindustan and Babur s related assumption of the title ghäzt. Again the shape of this bäzüband is Shahjahani; and again, perhaps, this is not historical inaccuracy as much as a deliberate attempt to signal continuity from past to present. After all, like those of Humayun, Babur's clothes are a plausible attempt at depicting dress from the later years of Timurid rule. Babur's left hand rests on a book, which must be the Bäburnäma. Its provision is consistent with other allegorical portraits of Babur datable to Shahjahans reign. This may well be interpreted as an "attribute" embodying literary achievements and relating to the bäzüband paratactically, so as to characterize Babur as a warrior and writer, respectively. Let us consider for a moment, however, the possibility of it being a visual prompt for the narrative contained in it, one that connects the other visual components of the painting in a coherent syntax. As with Humayuns portrait, only an underlying narrative would account for some visual oddity in this painting, where the flowering tree is set so close to Babur that it seems to share the carpet with him, if not to spring directly from his body. For this reason I initially regarded it as an afterthought, but close examination dis proved this possibility. Were this the work of a mediocre painter, it could be dis missed as an unsuccessful compositional device, but the artistic accomplishments of Payag force the consideration of other possibilities.28 Given that the tree seems to share the rug with Babur, it would be tempting to see it as yet another visualization of lineage, with its blossoms suggesting fruits to come. This conjecture is based on a "Western" type of allegorical reasoning, however, and for its part the visual gram mar implies alternatives more in keeping with the Persianate tradition. From a for mal point of view, the tree is rendered as a visual extension of Babur s halo, and it similarly appears to emanate from his body—not unlike the flowery meadow, only more explicitly. A viewer familiar with Persianate pictorial language would have been challenged to read it, in the manner of a halo, as the visualization of an inner quality. If conversant with the Bäburnäma, the same viewer probably would have made a connection with Babur's claim to have turned the dusty, orderless plains of Hindustan into a garden—the garden later celebrated by Shahjahans panegyrists as a mirror of the cosmic order.29 Thus the painting possibly provides a visual synthe sis of Babur's conquest of Hindustan and its transformation into an ordered realm, as related in the Bäburnäma. 274 LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="9">A potentially complex narrative emerges from this brief analysis of Payag's por traits of Babur and Humayun, one pertaining to the dynastic discourse cherished by Shahjahan and visualized by means of a combination of attributes and landscape elements.30 No detail seems superfluous: the whole picture resonates with coherent imagery. The response elicited from the viewer is remarkably similar to the chal lenge posed by certain kinds of riddles: three clues must be identified before an answer is safe to pronounce. One clue is straightforward—this must have been the case with the jewels.31 Another clue is provided by a deliberate lapse—the missing rug and the misplaced flowering tree. A third and final clue—the cut plane tree and the book—triggers a narrative that binds everything together. This impression is further confirmed by an analysis of the borders, and it is to these that I now turn my attention. The Borders Evidence that the two paintings were entrusted to different artists (or teams of art ists) for inclusion in the LSJA, substantiating the claim that they formed part of distinct openings, is found in the areas that were added in order to bring them to a size suitable for their double set of borders. In the Guimet page, atmospheric clouds derived from European art were added at the top and the stream and meadow were plausibly continued at the bottom, whereas in the Sackler page the artist seems to have proceeded more rapidly, using plain gold above and a brown wash, sugges tive of arid ground, below. Payag's paintings already show diverging features: the hillock is painted gray in one case, yellow in another. Given that color consistency seems to be a major concern in the pairing of images within the LSJA,32 it is pos sible that the portraits were not conceived to be viewed together from the outset but instead formed part of a more elaborate sequence, as suggested by Wright.33 A possible objection to her hypothesis that Babur once faced Timur is that the latter s positioning on the left-hand side seems to have been contrary to practice. As far as I am aware, where Timur is concerned, Mughal painting seems to comply with the logic of writing, signalling the ancestor s "precedence" by invariably placing him to the right (and/or having him look to the viewers left). It must be noted, however, that Wright presents some evidence of other possibly paired paintings where the recipient of imperial authority is indeed placed on the right. Both arrangements may well have been acceptable.34 After enlargement, each portrait was framed within two borders, with an inner one bearing tiny gold floral designs on a peach ground and an outer one compris ing the figurai designs characteristic of the LSJA group. Imperial portraits such as these are typically framed by figures arranged in a hierarchy of levels, with human beings occupying an intermediate space between angels above, holding royal 275 two pages from the late shahjahan album</page><page sequence="10">attributes, and animals (or occasionally servants) below in various attitudes. By contrast, non-royal subjects are as a rule surrounded by human figures exclusively, and in no instance are they accompanied by angels.35 It is commonly assumed that these borders postdate Payag's paintings by sev eral years;36 they unquestionably differ in authorship between themselves as well as from the main images. Disclosing the identity of the hands that painted them is no easy task. To my knowledge, the issue has never seriously been raised in relation to the LSJA. This is surprising, considering the borders from this group are occasion ally of such high quality that they could well have been painted by the same great artists who signed some of the main images. After all, precedents for this practice are already documented in Jahangir's reign. Although figurai borders were intro duced several decades earlier,37 the increasingly standardized approach of Shah jahan's artists, who followed recognizable patterns,38 not only contrasts with the variety encouraged by Jahangir but also recalls similar trends witnessed in other arts from the same period. This does not mean Shahjahan's artists were not allowed to innovate, as is testified by an analysis of these two borders, but it does mean they acted within more prescriptive rules. For some time LSJA borders have been acknowledged to "frequently provide thematic extensions of the subject of the central illustration,"39 and these pages are no exception. In the case of the Guimet border (fig. 1), the book in Babur's lap pro vided the artist with an opportunity to create a unique variation on the motif of angels carrying royal paraphernalia. While angels in comparable LSJA pages nor mally bear royal attributes, such as crowns, parasols, or arms,40 here they carry a scroll and a book, complementing the characterization of Babur as a writer. The scroll most likely refers to the now-lost khatt-i bâburî, a script he devised around 1504.41 Books are also a leitmotif with the figures in the outer border. At first sight the three men appear not dissimilar from the "mystics" in several other LSJA pages who were formerly interpreted as men of religion;42 years ago they struck me as possible "companions" of Babur in his literary achievements. At the same time, a certain religious aura is unquestionably there. Note in particular the rosary one of them holds. These suggestions may be further refined when considering the fact that the figures in the LSJA borders are always carefully individualized, and some of them have been acknowledged as portraits of Shahjahan's contemporaries. In this case, it is possible that equally plausible "portraits" of renowned individuals were intended and would have been recognizable to viewers by means of appropriate clues. That these men are not Shahjahan's contemporaries, however, is underscored by the pronounced differences in their headgear and clothing, which suggest differ ent moments in Islamic history as well as different regions of the world. LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="11">Much like a visual riddle, the books bear no inscriptions, only tiny and delicate gold vegetal designs—yet they establish the right trail, not so much by qualifying these men as writers, as I had initially assumed, as by referring to specific texts. The clothes worn by the bottom figure point to a Timurid milieu: the striped coat is traditionally worn by Uzbek and Tajik men to this day, and the headgear closely resembles that of Babur. The rosary in the man's hand, an attribute of the Naqsh bandi, is a decisive clue in favor of an identification with Abd al-Rahman Jami (1414-1492), who was closely associated with the court of Sultan-Husayn Mirza of Herat (reigned 1470-1506).43 It is an especially appropriate attribute, referring at once to Jami's capacity as the head of the Naqshbandi order and to the title of a well-known section of his Haft awrang, the Subhat al-Abrär (Rosary of the pious). Once more a further clue may be found in the trees, if they are taken to be more than ornamental. Although palms are frequently depicted in Mughal painting, these are prominently characterized as date palms (Phoenix dactyliphera), a spe cies closely associated with Arabia.44 Shahjahans contemporaries would have been aware that Jami had performed the Hajj, and even the most skeptical reader would have to admit that this is a more economical explanation than a mere coincidence. The emergence of principles similar to those governing the main images adds cre dential to the suggestion that these figures deliberately addressed an audience that was acquainted with riddles—in particular, with mu'ammas, which held clues to names—and expected intellectual as well as visual delight when looking at these albums.45 The middle figure, a cheerful old man with a large turban and three conspicu ous books, may be identified on the basis of similar principles. His large turban and white beard provide the first clue. Although similar to many "old mystics," rang ing from mythological figures such as Khwaja Khizr to actual contemporaries of the Mughals, the man bears a certain resemblance to seventeenth-century Mughal images of Sa'di (circa 1213-1292).46 Accordingly, the three books may represent the Büstän, the Gulistän, and another of his works, possibly the Risàia. The third clue is his cheerful attitude, if it is taken to be a visual-verbal pun on Sa'dt (saadat = happiness). This only makes sense with the adoption of the logic of riddles and their continuous bouncing back and forth between concepts. The ensuing narrative echoes the main image at multiple levels. There certainly is an adab dimension to the Bäburnäma (Sa'di is, accordingly, the author most often quoted by Babur), and the garden metaphor identified as a prominent theme in the principal image reso nates with the same imagery as works by Sa'di. Further intertextual connections may be drawn between Sa'di's Gulistän and Jami's Bahäristän, texts that held special importance for Shahjahan. The combined figures of Sa'di and Jami are the protagonists of at least one more LSJA opening. 277 TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="12">6 6 Sa'di and companions, by Bichitr. Folio from the LSJA. Mughal, ca. 1650. Border, ca. 1650-58. Chester Beatty Library, Dublin, In 07B.24. While the whereabouts of its left half (where Jami figured in the main composition) are unknown, and its border has never been published, the border surrounding the image of Sa'di with companions (fig. 6) contains a close parallel for the purported Jami.47 It is possible that the artist had this very opening in mind when painting the Guimet border. The complex intertextual references that emerge suggest intellectual delectation remained a major concern even at a time and place so far removed from our idea of proper "Persian" albums—and the choice of authors was at once distinctively Mughal and fully within the fold of the Persian canon. The topmost figure is the most problematic. He is a middle-aged man, with a beard but no moustache, whose complexion is slightly darker than the other two. His small turban closely resem bles those seen in paintings ascribed to the Delhi sultanate,48 but attempts to iden tify him with Amir Khusraw Dihlavi (1253-1325) meet with relevant objections. Amir Khusraw died in old age and could not have been deemed superior to Sa'di, nor did he precede Sa'di in time—therefore he could hardly have been assigned a higher place. As is further testified by the Sackler page (see below), the vertical hier archy would not seem limited to the three broad sections of a border, but it is most likely in place at every level within the page—a relevant point for future research on LSJA borders. Possibly artists followed the same criteria in structuring borders as they did with traditional texts, such as consulting biographical dictionaries to flesh LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="13">out their depictions of historical figures (see below). If this were the case, we should expect "descent" to be defined by a chronological succession as well as by hierarchi cal principles, in the manner of isnäds for texts (or sibilas for individuals).49 Then, of course, the overall conception for these borders—with a hierarchy of beings cul minating in heavenly creatures surrounding an icon—follows well-known princi ples in Indian religious iconography, and its introduction is most plausibly ascribed to the artists in Shahjahan's service, the majority of whom were non-Muslims. With this in mind, various details suggest this is none other than the Prophet. Although the choice of clothes may be questioned, the figure's attitude in particu lar hints at a dimension beyond the page, one towards which an angel also looks. Note the connection that the mans gesture establishes between Babur and the text contained in the book he holds open. This suggests—in accordance with this inter pretation—not only an acknowledgment of Babur as a legitimate Muslim ruler but also a reference to some more specific "prediction" associated with a verse in the Koran. For the creation of this daring and possibly unprecedented image, the artist may have adapted a European model. The profile view was probably chosen as the one most suited to an idealized, dignified image.50 At a time when one of Shahja han's artists went as far as depicting God himself,51 this hypothesis should not be discounted—although alternative suggestions are welcome. The combination of heterogeneous models may possibly account for the slightly ineffective juxtaposi tion of seated and standing figures in this section of the border. Nonetheless, both visually and conceptually, these are elaborate, impressive figures. A relative disappointment occurs when turning to the lower portion of the bor der. The two animals, stiff and naïve, are not among the best of their kind in the LSJA, yet they also bespeak conceptual refinement. In principle, they are but one more variation of the "golden age" theme that was first introduced at the Mughal court in the sixteenth century and was especially popular under Jahangir and Shah jahan.52 The herbivore, however, is unusual. This is especially remarkable when considering that, judging from its wooden stance and the lion's anthropomorphic expression, the painter was neither particularly interested in fauna nor working from direct observation. Why, then, did he resort to an exotic-looking animal (the amount of fur alone indicates this was not a familiar sight on the plains of Hindu stan) instead of using one of the countless species with which he was doubtlessly more acquainted? It is indeed likely that this is a yak, as Amina Okada first suggested to me,53 and its inclusion here may reflect an intention to visualize Babur's rule over two lands. The idea that this "northerly" quadruped embodies Transoxiana (the Timurids' homeland, which was historically coveted by Shahjahan) will become more plausible when viewed in light of established Mughal pictorial conventions. Consider such precedents as fahangir's Dream in the Freer Gallery of Art, where a 279 TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="14">lion and a ram (more like a lamb, actually, and not without purpose) are associated respectively with the lands of Hindustan and Iran.54 This reading receives further support from the main image. If the latter represents the narrative of the conquest contained in the Bäburnäma, the animals echo its structure and chronology, where Hindustan is clearly set apart from the Timurid homeland.55 The Sackler page (fig. 2) has a similar structure, but its outer border comprises only standing figures that are somewhat larger and less successfully distributed.56 Two of the objects carried by the angels are familiar royal paraphernalia: a globe and a rather large crown. The third is less usual: it is a cüdäyantra (ring dial), an astronomical instrument traditionally used in India to determine time precisely, especially at birth, and therefore it is essential to the calculation of horoscopes, an art practiced by Humayun.57 In this respect, the cüdäyantra constitutes an alter native to the compasses that are more commonly seen as Humayuns attribute in Shahjahani painting, here replaced in his hand by a sarplch. By considering the cüdäyantras association with an "auspicious hour," an organic interpretation of the attributes maybe achieved, with the insignia—a globe, an astronomical instrument, and a crown—at once hailing the reconstitution of Timurid power at a divinely sanctioned time and containing a multiple visual-verbal pun on Humayun's name: "august, auspicious, royal."58 As Okada has already acknowledged, the figures in the outer border allude to Humayun's sojourn at the Safavid court (1543-44).59 They all wear Safavid (or pseudo-Safavid) clothes, although several features in their costume are anachronis tic—more suited to Shahjahan's contemporaries than to the age of Humayun and Tahmasb. We are now fully equipped to address them as responses to the narrative unfolded in the main image. The topmost figure is the most visually rewarding. The fur-lined brocaded coat and richly embroidered Täj-i Haydarï complete with an assortment of feathers signal high rank. Note in particular the sarpïch made of egret plumes, a hallmark of royalty virtually identical to that on Humayun's Täj-i 'Izzat.60 An identification with Shah Tahmasb is likely. Although the latter's facial features in his mature years have not been recorded in Safavid painting, Sahifa Banu's earlier work (fig. 4) testi fies that Mughal artists felt free (or were possibly urged by their patrons) to create portraits of the shah based on their imagination. In the Sackler page the resem blance with Shahjahan's near-contemporary Shah Abbas (reigned 1588-1629) is remarkable—and indeed suspicious. His features, including a characteristically large moustache, were well known to Mughal artists from a series of portraits based on life sketches commissioned by Jahangir.61 The man's deferent attitude and the gold tray in his hands suggest an offering. If Tahmasb indeed was "reconstructed" by casting Abbas in early Safavid garb, the tray most likely signals his support of 28ο LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="15">Humayun—with temporary hospitality, troops, and doubtlessly a fair amount of cash—in perfect consonance with the theme of the main composition.62 The signif icance of the lilies, if not merely a formal device linking different borders (compare this with the other page examined), remains to be assessed. The other two figures, dressed in simpler clothes and holding a parasol and a sword in its casing, respectively, may be identified as attendants.63 Although their primary visual relationship is with the main image, the clothes are sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Safavid, and the willow behind the young attendant—a motif common in Safavid painting—further strengthens the connection with Iran. Are they attendants of Humayun or of Tahmasb? A more specific identification of these figures may prove impossible to achieve in the absence of detailed biographical information, but a closer examination of the plants associated with them may pos sibly prove rewarding in the future. For their part, the palms flanking the other figure belong to the Mughal decora tive repertoire and likely tell a more complex story.64 At least one of them seems to serve the primary function of separating the visual space of the outer border from that inhabited by the animals: compare it with the line of shrubs in the Guimet page. The association of a tree with a clinging creeper, however, also evokes loyalty. Could this be someone Humayun first met in Iran and who subsequently became one of his retainers? The animals are the most remarkable feature of this border, and for once they are not a variation on the "golden age" theme, although they are similarly based on ancient, pre-Islamic iconography. A boldly drawn male lion is shown receding in the face of a charging buffalo. For all its resonance with the eternal cycle of light and darkness, the bovine creature is neither of the appropriate species nor—judging from appearances at least—of the prescribed gender. Equally unusual is the atti tude of the two animals. The buffalo charges and the lion recedes, although with unsheathed claws that testify to a willingness to fight back. Both animals are mas terfully rendered, and they are doubtlessly based on the artist s direct observation. The buffalo appears to snort as its foreleg strikes the ground, its eye upturned in fury, while the minute wrinkles on the lions nose and forehead precisely convey the attitude of a frightened cat. These are arguably the most sensitively rendered animals in the whole LSJA. The lion's attitude in itself is not unique, but it is part of a stock repertoire that Mughal artists used when depicting large cats. There are paral lels even within the LSJA album,65 yet in the hands of different artists, this familiar cliché could produce widely different results, from blind repetition to a masterpiece such as this one. Here, too, it is legitimate to wonder why a buffalo was chosen in place of a more familiar herbivore. Unlike yaks, buffalos (wild or domesticated) are a common 28i two pages from the late shahjahan album</page><page sequence="16">sight in India, but they are not frequently encountered in Mughal art. Perhaps this is due to its traditionally negative connotations on the Subcontinent, where buf falo is in turn the vehicle (vähana) of Yama—the guardian of the South, a direc tion associated with death—and a form of the demon Mahisha that symbolizes the chain of death and rebirth from which human beings seek deliverance.66 In view of the general theme of this page and of its apparent dominance over the lion, this buffalo might stand for Humayun's arch-rivals, the Surs who ousted the Mughals from Hindustan. If a variation on the theme of the competing forces of light and darkness was intended with some derogatory meaning, a she-buffalo was probably the artist s best bet at achieving this.67 Authorship Given the high quality of the LSJA borders, it is surprising scholars have not made hypotheses on the identity of the artists involved. Different hands undoubtedly cre ated the two borders under discussion; the animals alone provide ample evidence for this. While I agree with Okada that neither border can be attributed to Payag,68 his hand is possibly recognized in another LSJA border, the main image of which is by a different painter.69 By looking at other LSJA pages, the consistent impres sion emerges that painters provided borders for their colleagues' work but not their own. Further research may substantiate or disprove this paradigm and provide a glimpse into the way work was distributed in the atelier for the shaping of a Mughal album. In attempting to identify specific hands, we are confronted in the first place with the nature of border illustrations, which—even when successful—do not necessar ily show a degree of finish comparable to that of the paintings they frame. This may be the outcome of masters working at different speeds, but it may equally well point to the work of more junior artists. The possibility remains that a team produced them rather than an individual hand. The varying degree of finish in different areas of the same border may similarly reflect adherence to specific conventions or indicate specialists were called in to create certain sections. Last but not least, as even this limited sample shows, borders probably rely on existing models more frequently and possibly more literally than individual paintings, which further confuses the picture. The angels in these two pages are one example. Unlike the remaining figures, they are only lightly tinted, but why this is the case—could it be different authorship, aesthetic conventions, or reliance on diverse models?—is a matter of debate. The appearance of the Guimet page (fig. 1) suggests it was created by an art ist fully at home with some of the Europeanizing conventions typical of Mughal art in the seventeenth century. The artist displays a consistent preference for soft LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="17">7 Detail, Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram, attributed to 'Abid, ca. 1635. From the Windsor Pädshähnäma, fol. 192v. 7 modeling, with an extensive use of shading as well as white highlights to create supple forms that are best exemplified by one of the angels. The contrast between the human figures and the animals is remarkable. This might point to two different hands, possibly in the roles of master and assistant, or to a single skilled portraitist who was especially uncomfortable with depicting animals. The hypothesis of two concurrent hands would at first seem supported by the appearance of the angels, whose treatment is remarkably different, but the significant iconographie differ ences between them (especially their wings) speak in favor of reliance on distinct sources.70 The painter active under Shahjahan who makes the most consistent use of white to highlight figures is arguably Govardhan, who would have been especially at home with the mystics-literati, but I find no conclusive evidence to associate this page with his hand. Furthermore, as testified by one of his signed works as well as by other paintings ascribed to him, Govardhan is one of Shahjaharís great animal portraitists.71 While this may lead back to the issue of joint (if not team) authorship for this page, the consistent use of white highlights does support the idea that one particular master supervised and finished its design. Despite a less-successful distribution of the figures, the Sackler border (fig. 2) conveys an impression of greater homogeneity The face of the angel to the right is particularly impressive, and so is the "portrait" of the purported Safavid shah, although a slight stiffness in posture characterizes these figures when compared to those in the Guimet page. This painter makes a far more restricted use of shading. His figures somewhat lack corporeity, but he makes up for this with a vibrant line. Alternatively, again, this may be the outcome of joint work by a master and an assis tant. The angels are closely modeled on those depicted under the rulers jharoka in a page from the Windsor Pädshähnäma, thus providing further insight into atelier practice (fig. 7).72 More of these connections are likely to emerge as research on LSJA borders progresses. I do not lay claim to any revolutionary hypotheses as to the artists who painted these borders, but a preliminary examination of the Sackler page, in particular of its boldly rendered figures, both human and animal, suggests a possible connec tion with Bichitr. Unfortunately, animals are more rarely depicted in Shahjahani painting than in his predecessor's reign. To make matters even more difficult, they often appear as sketches or as minute architectural ornaments. This creates a lim ited scope for comparisons. This painter used an especially fine line to outline the contours of his figures. The result is a vibrancy not seen in any of the other LSJA ani mals, even the most successfully rendered ones.73 Among the great masters, Bichitr TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="18">Detail, Jujhar Singh Bundela Kneels in Submission to Shah Jahan, by Bichitr. Mughal, ca. 1630-40. From the Minto Album. Chester Beatty Library, Dublin, In 07A.16. and Govardhan share this trait. Both of them were skilled animal painters, yet Bich itr alone displays a predilection for relatively flat surfaces, with subdued shading and, where applicable, an emphasis on pattern. The human figures in the Sackler border point in the same direction, and a strong similarity exists between the young Safavid attendant and the chauri-bearer in a page from the Windsor Pädshähnäma signed by Bichitr. Despite their tiny size, the animal figures under the jharoka on the same page provide a close parallel for those in the Sackler border.74 A further example of Bichitr s ability to create impressive animal portraits is provided by a detail in one of his signed works from the Minto Album (fig. 8). Note especially the similar approach to some of the anatomical details.75 Although further research is needed, attempts to connect individual artists with the best from among the LSJA borders may ultimately prove rewarding. Conclusion Since my research on these two pages first began, at least one more essay on the LSJA album has been published, besides the one included in the Muraqqa cata logue. Written by Amina Okada and focusing on a single page, that article demon strates the potential of an approach sensitive to iconographie details combined with accurate historical research.761 have meanwhile identified yet one more LSJA page with promising biographical connections to explore.77 It would seem that research on Mughal albums is entering a new phase. The two pages examined in this essay raise numerous questions concerning the processes involved in creating Mughal albums, in shaping their informing prin ciples, and in determining their place in relation to the Persianate album tradition. In regards to making albums, the pages provide evidence of collaborative patterns within the imperial atelier. Along with other LSJA folios, they suggest painters did not provide the borders for their own works. While this may not be the only para digm, it is certainly worthy of attention, as is the question of whether a single mas ter created or supervised the overall design of borders associated with surviving openings. Judging from these two pages, the coordinated effort would not seem limited to individual works. Even though produced by different hands and not originally meant to face each other, these borders appear to have been conceived 284 LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="19">as variations on a predetermined scheme. This is underscored by the uniquely rich array of atmospheric elements associated with the angels, by the matching inner borders, and especially by the plants flanking the figures in the outer borders. Upon close observation, the plants reveal subtle variations on a unified scheme.78 Such underlying structural elements must have subliminally contributed a great deal to former perceptions of these pages as a pair. Although it now seems this was never the case, their high degree of visual coherence indicates they must have been part of a carefully planned sequence of openings. Perhaps comparable sequences will be identified on a similar basis in the future. Equally relevant to an understanding of the album-making process is the iden tity of the professionals involved. These pages point to the artists' confident hand ling of the biographical information required for an accurate representation of the subjects. Was this knowledge their own or were they assisted by scholars? On the one hand, it is increasingly clear that the distinction between "Hindus" and "Mus lims" is hardly applicable to the Mughal environment, where education followed similar patterns. Seventeenth-century painters, though mostly non-Muslim, must have had greater familiarity with Persianate culture than has long been assumed, especially if they were born at court (khänazäds).79 At the same time, the possibil ity should not be discounted of other professionals being involved. Wright hints at this in her discussion of the Salim Album (circa 1600-1605) when she remarks on "the literary facility of the individual who was able to call to mind a verse that would respond to the painting (and sometimes in a slightly humorous way)."80 Even in the LSJA, where the paintings are complemented by images rather than by texts, pages such as these suggest textual references continued to provide a background. It would be challenging to identify some of the biographical dictionaries and other textual supports that are implied. A wider corpus of manuscripts than the richly illustrated ones could fruitfully complement the art historians work.81 A final question relevant to album-making concerns the accessibility of models and the use of motifs from stock repertoires. The angels in the Sackler border are a case in point. They suggest motifs adaptable to different contexts—such as album borders and sketches mimicking architectural decoration—were available for ref erence and use. The issue of paintings echoing other paintings leads to a second group of ques tions that are relevant to understanding the principles informing Mughal albums. While paintings within paintings have a long history in Mughal art,82 the two pages under scrutiny prompt us to wonder whether the introduction of figurai commen taries around paintings in the seventeenth century followed similar principles, and whether the practice was similarly aimed at evoking complex visual as well as textual connections. At variance with the prevalent narrative of Mughal albums TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="20">embodying the culmination of a process of increased formalization and an empha sis on figurai painting—first challenged by David Roxburgh83—they force us to consider the resilience of the trope as a structuring factor in Mughal albums.84 Evi dence from these two pages makes a strong case for bringing Mughal albums back into the fold of the Persianate tradition. It is possible that the sophisticated visual language emerging from the present analysis is specific to albums and was inspired by established literary conventions. What literature should be considered in this connection is an interesting question. Ebba Koch warns, "Court historians and poets were clearly more restricted than the artists in the selection of topics by the stylistic and thematic conventions of their genre, which they seem to have been incapable of or prohibited from breaking."85 Perhaps the issue is whether literary parallels should be confined to the best-known works from among the genres practiced at court—and whether it is satisfactory to look at Mughal albums primarily, if not exclusively, from the perspective of court art.86 For all their emphasis on royalty, these two pages seem to point to a broader literary spectrum than that of contemporary eulogistic poetry and historical court writing. While their primary theme might well be royalty—or the oft-quoted "legiti mization"—their context (the album) is defined by a longer history and a wider tradi tion, and their primary aim may well have been intellectual delectation, if not moral instruction or the reinforcement of a shared ethos through shared experience.87 Thus far scholarship, concerned for the most part with a preliminary catego rization of the styles associated with individual periods, patrons, or painters, has necessarily focused on the recurrent iconographie themes of Shahjahani painting. The ensuing narrative has possibly induced the misleading impression of over whelming repetition, as opposed to the endless variations that probably dominated contemporary perception. Achieving a finer appreciation of the literary texts that were popular at court and those that made up the building blocks in the education of youths would in this sense be especially important. Again this would require a broader range of manuscripts than the lavishly illustrated ones usually considered by art historians. An approach more sensitive to the way modes and codes inherited from a prior tradition were interpreted in Shahjahani album painting would pos sibly open up new perspectives on this period, which is often referred to as maturity foreshadowing incipient decadence. After all, it is precisely this constant reworking of a coherent visual-textual corpus that constitutes most of the appeal of Timurid painting. The outward dif ferences in the pictorial modes adopted by the Timurids' Indian descendants and the visual innovations of the late sixteenth to early seventeenth century should not detract from an awareness of their shared background. For the Mughals, painting was in essence about the revelation of inner truths.88 Increased visual effectiveness LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="21">and a more inclusive style, one capable of drawing in a broader audience—in a man ner not dissimilar from the translations of the Sanskrit classics promoted by Akbar or Dara Shikoh's visionary synthesis—were only improved means to a familiar end. A related issue is the necessity to refine the current idea that allegorical dis course in Mughal court painting was to a large extent prompted by contact with European art. Although European influences are undeniable, prior research has shown the Mughals selectively adapted themes and motifs and grafted them onto a familiar discourse.89 Mughal art is so imbued with a sense of the celebration of power that to date research has focused mostly on related imagery, but by devoting greater attention to literary themes, we may well be able to enrich this view. Accomplishing this has a direct bearing on the way we usually understand the term "allegory" to apply to Mughal painting. A finer appreciation of the origins of Mughal albums would make all the difference here. So far, Mughal allegorical paintings have arguably been approached in a manner similar to European exam ples—as a kind of allegory with which Western scholars are more familiar. Connec tions with allegory as conceived in Persian literature have not received sufficient attention. Research in this domain necessarily entails work on the early phases of Mughal painting and the first steps of the Mughal album tradition, particularly at a time when European influence could hardly have played a significant role. As my current research shows,90 the widespread idea that Mughal painting originated with Humayuns contact with Tahmasbs atelier during his sojourn at the Safavid court between 1543 and 1544 requires refinement. Muraqqa's are explicitly mentioned at Humayuns court alongside illustrated manuscripts as early as 1534 ce, a full decade before his sojourn in Iran.91 It is premature to say whether the passage refers to albums and illustrated books produced in his kitäbkhäna92 or to Timurid heir looms, but most likely it is to both. While some inferential evidence supports the former, even the latter would imply continuity with—and access to—the Timurid tradition. This should come as no surprise: Humayun was himself a Timurid, and in the dispersal of artists and artworks that followed the decline and fall of the dynasty he inherited his share. (See Parodi and Wannell, "Earliest Mughal Painting," for a discussion of currently available evidence.) While the issue cannot be dealt with at length here, this suggestion is reinforced by the dating of the earliest known Safavid album, one produced for Bahram Mirza, the shah's brother, shortly after Humayuns passage in Iran. Far from being a coincidence, this connection opens up fascinating new perspectives on how these two refined patrons of the arts may have interacted. According to Jawhar, Humayun developed an especially profound friendship with Bahram Mirza. It is therefore possible that the concept for the lat ter's album, if not some of the materials therein, originated from conversations and majlises entertained at the time of Humayuns visit.93 Although limited pictorial TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="22">evidence survives from Humayuns reign, and none can be securely ascribed to the period prior to his sojourn at the Safavid court,94 a reassessment of painting during his reign is urgently needed. Its implications for the study of Mughal painting, and the Mughal album tradition in particular, cannot be overestimated. The two pages under scrutiny also point towards a more refined dating for vari ous LSJA pages. The figures of S ad i and Jami in the Guimet border (fig. 1) suggest the artist must have had another LSJA opening in mind: this implies a relative chro nology. Since the general appearance of these two pages betrays greater maturity and complexity than most surviving LSJA materials, they may be the product of a somewhat later phase, if not part of a different album. This in turn depends on our understanding of Mughal albums, and of the LSJA in particular, as either closed or open entities. While it is premature to venture any conclusions, the question will have to be addressed from a wider range of perspectives in the future. As a tree first prompted this research, it is perhaps fitting to conclude this dis cussion with a vegetal metaphor. Mughal painting has in the LSJA one of its most delicious fruits. The Timurid legacy, however, is much like a tree, whose branches become thinner the farther away they grow from the trunk that sustains them and the roots that nourish them. The underlying Timurid pictorial imagery has here thinned almost beyond recognition. By comparison, the structure of Humayuni (and early Akbari) painting appears more solid and coherent, and their more com plex syntax poses even greater interpretive challenges.95 Indeed, the more we look at these pages, the more we are reminded of the respective places of the Taj Mahal and the tomb of Humayun in the history of Mughal architecture.

The addition of Shahjahans likeness shows that seventeenth-century Mughal artists had access to the painting. 13 Although Timurid egret ornaments are commonly known in scholarship as sarpichs, the name jigha was current at the time. Sarpïch more properly refers to the ornaments used by Shahjahan: see Susan Stronge, "Jewels for the Mughal Court," V&amp;A Album 5 (1986), 309-17. The term sarpïch is used here for reasons of clarity and consistency. Sultan-Husayn Mirza wears an almost identical ornament in his turban in a well-known portrait (Lentz and Lowry, Timur, no. 136), in accordance with Babur's description: Bäburnäma, 206 (fol. 164a). 14 This is suggested by Stronge, "Jewels for the Mughal Court," 313.

A similar page is illustrated in Barbara Schmitz and Ziyaud-Din A. Desai, Mughal and Persian Paintings and Illustrated Manuscripts in the Raza Library, Rampur (New Delhi: Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, 2006), pi. 62. One example in point is the painting showing Shah Shuja' and Maharaja Gaj Singh of Marwar (Okada, Le Grand Moghol, 166 and fig. 202), where the prince holds up what I would suggest is a jade thumb-ring in his right hand while he converses with the maharaja. Milo Cleveland Beach, The Grand Mogul: Imperial Painting in India 1600-1660 (Williamstown, MA: Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 1978), 102, suggests a dating to 1638, when the experienced Gaj Singh was assigned to support the prince in his Qandahar campaign. The thumb-ring, symbolizing prowess in battle, possibly refers to this relationship. A series of portraits of royal offspring standing and prominently holding sarpichs is equally worthy of attention: see for example Okada, Le Grand Moghol, figs. 201,215; Wright, Muraqqa', no. 81.

Similarly complex narratives are seen already in the spectacular group of allegorical portraits painted a few decades earlier for Jahangir, Shahjahan's father. A seminal discussion is found in Richard Ettinghausen, "The Emperors Choice," in Essays in Honour of Erwin Panofsky, ed. M. Meiss, DeArtibus Opuscula 40 (New York, 1961), 98-120.

One page has not retained its outer borders, but on each of the others the upper border is filled with pairs of flying angels, though with the exception of three pages on which there are instead flying birds.... The European-style angels of the upper borders carry crowns, globes, swords, and parasols, all symbols of Mughal imperial authority and might, which, as the presence of the angels themselves proclaims, is divinely bestowed upon the figures above whose heads they hover." 41 Bäburnäma, 186 (fol. 144b); see also 223, 422 (fols. 179a, 357b). 42 "Ulémas," according to Okada, Le Grand Moghol, 210. Borders featuring religious figures are illustrated in ibid., fig. 207; Wright, Muraqqa, no. 68A; Soudavar, Persian Courts, no. 129c. 43 The Bäburnäma, 221 (fol. 177b) includes a biographical entry for Jami among the distinguished intellectuals of his time. 44 Credit goes to Amina Okada for first prompting me not to overlook these palms, long before I had even begun to approach these borders as visual riddles. 45 David Roxburgh's seminal work on albums is especially relevant to an appreciation of this aspect: see especially Prefacing the Image: The Writing of Art History in Sixteenth-Century Iran, Studies and Sources in Islamic Art and Architec ture, Supplements to Muqarnas (Leiden and New York: E. J. Brill, 2001), 50-51. The Mughals continued to cherish Jami's works. The Muraqqa' catalogue provides several examples (see nos. 3,5,7); among these is his treatise on riddles, the Hilya-yi Hiulal (Embroideries of robes): 291 TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="26">see Wright, Muraqqa', no. 3. On the mu'ammä, see Paul E. Losensky, Welcoming Fighänl: Imitation and Poetic Individuality in the Safavid-Mughal Ghazal (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 1998), 154-64. 46 See for example Wright, Muraqqa, no. 63, discussed below; Richard Ettinghau sen, Paintings of the Sultans and Emperors of India in American Collec tions (New Delhi: Lalit Kala Akademi, 1961), pi. 11; or Toby Falk and Mildred Archer, Indian Miniatures in the India Office Library (London: Sotheby Park Bernet, 1981), no. 83. The latter is an interesting case, where Sa'di is part of an "allegorical group painting" (by Hashim, ca. 1650) depicting Timur and his descendants up to Jahangir. Timur, Babur, and Humayun, which are also by Hashim, are virtually identical with those in Goswamy and Fischer, Wonders of a Golden Age, no. 40 (see n. 14 above), but only Babur preserves his attribute, while Sa'di's attitude suggests he is "awarding" Timur with a book (possibly the Gulistän). Could this mean Timur is thereby acknowledged as a model ruler? In light of these findings, it would be worth considering some of Ettinghausens suggestions regarding the artists' differing interpretations of the ruler-dervish relationship under Jahangir and Shahjahan (see "Emperors Choice," esp. 110-19). This, however, falls beyond the scope of the present essay. 47 For a discussion see Wright, Muraqqa', no. 63. 48 See for example Karl Khandalavala and Saryu Doshi, An Age of Splendour: Islamic Art in India (Bombay: Marg Publications, 1983), color pi. 11. 49 Compare this with Roxburgh's discussion of the chains of practice contained in Safavid album prefaces: see Prefacing the Image, 136-42. 0 Compare Koch's discussion of the use of the profile view in Shahjahani painting in Beach and Koch, King of the World, 135-36. 1 See Lowry with Nemazee, Jeweler's Eye, no. 55. 2 Wright, Muraqqa, 122-23; see also Koch, Mughal Art, for a more detailed discus sion. 3 Personal communication, January 2001. Wright mentions this with a question mark: see Wright, Muraqqa', 123. 4 See Ettinghausen, Paintings of the Sultans, pi. 12. 5 The Bäburnäma is actually divided into three sections corresponding to the regions successively ruled by Babur— Transoxiana, Kabul, and Hindustan—in a "descent" that is, I believe, not merely geographical or chronological. For all his acknowledgment of Hindustan's riches, Babur remained firmly rooted in his sense of Timurid superiority. That two, rather than three, animals are depicted here should not discount this reading, given the strict criteria that governed the LSJA and the need to harmonize this page with the one facing it, which is now lost. 6 Wright,Muraqqa, 124. 7 According to the Humäyünnäma, fol. 43b (see Thackston, Three Memoirs, Persian text, 1: 37, and English transla tion, 1: 37), Humayun himself calculated the most auspicious hour for his marriage with Hamida Banu. The cüdäyantra is often seen in the hands of astrologers in paintings recording the birth of Mughal princes. The instrument is described by S. R. Sarma, "Astronomi cal Instruments in Mughal Miniatures," Studien sur Indologie und Iranistik 16/17 (1992), 249-52.1 am indebted to Amina Okada for pointing this detail out to me and for providing me with the relevant bibliography. 58 Each of the three objects in turn may be associated with one of the meanings of the name humäyün. I have previously pointed out a comparable pun on the expression sarir-i humäyüni (imperial throne/throne of Humayun) contained in the Akbarnama: see Parodi, "Humayun's Sojourn," 153. 59 Okada, Le Grand Moghol, 210. 60 On the Täj-i Haydari and the Täj-i 'Izzat, see Parodi, "Humayun's Sojourn." 61 See Asok Kumar Das, "Bishandas: 'Unequalled in his age in taking likenesses,"' Mughal Masters, 112-33, esp. 119-28. 62 Even though the tray appears empty under magnification, minute engravings of objects, such as coins or stars, are sometimes visible on such trays only through macrophotography. Amina Okada, personal communication, May 2007. 63 Compare the figure with the correspond ing attendant in "Princes of the House of Timur," illustrated in Canby, Humayun's Garden Party, 60. 64 Palms of this type are discussed in Laura E. Parodi, "Alcune osservazioni sulle decorazioni della 'Casa della Sultana Turca' a Fatehpur-Sikri," Haft Qalam: Studi in onore di Bianca Maria Alfieri (Naples: Arte Tipografica, 2000), 51-68. 65 See for example Soudavar, Persian Courts, no. 129d. Parallels may similarly be found for the posture of the lion in the Guimet page. See for example Wright, Muraqqa, no. 69. 66 See Susan L. Huntington, The Art of Ancient India: Buddhist, Hindu, Jain (New York: Weatherhill, 1985), figs. 15.25 and 15.20, respectively. 67 It occurred to me that there might be a more specific reference to wild buffalos LAURA E. PARODI</page><page sequence="27">or possibly a domestic breed from the Sur's stronghold of Bihar. South Asian water buffalos, whether wild (Bubalus arnee) or domestic (Bubalus bubalis arnee), display a wide variety of horn shapes (see www.arkive.org/asian-buffa lo/bubalus-bubalis/). Subject to further confirmation, horns similar to these would indeed seem to be associated with the buffalos of northeast India. See for example www.payer.de/amarakosa2/ amara209b.htm. I personally have not come across comparable examples in other parts of the subcontinent. 68 Okada, Le Grand Moghol, 210. 69 Wright, Muraqqa', no. 61. Okada, Le Grand Moghol, 214-15, suggests his authorship of some other LSJA borders. 70 This is not without precedent in Mughal art. Compare the various angels and winged creatures illustrated and discussed in Koch, "Jahangir and the Angels: Recently Discovered Wall Paintings under European Influence in the Fort of Lahore," in Koch, Mughal Art, 12-37. 71 See for example Okada, Le Grand Moghol, figs. 44,237. 72 Illustrated in Beach and Koch, King of the World, no. 37, attributed to Abid who, on stylistic grounds, cannot be the author of the Sackler border. Interestingly, this is not a case of passive reception. The face of the angel to the right is significantly improved, and the globe is transferred from Khwaja Khizr's hand to the other angel. Then, of course, both surviving instances may have been based on an earlier but now-lost model. 73 See for example the animals in two more Sackler borders, illustrated in Lowry and Beach, Annotated and Illustrated Checklist, nos. 332 and 338, and one in the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin, illustrated in Wright, Muraqqa', no. 69. Illustrated in Beach and Koch, King of the World, nos. 12-13. For a complete illustration see Wright, Muraqqa, no. 51. Amina Okada, "Un ambassadeur uzbek à la cour du Grand Moghol: note sur un portrait moghol conservé au Musée Guimet," La Revue des Musées de France—Revue du Louvre 1 (2007), 41-49. I believe I can recognize all four sons of Shahjahan in the border surrounding a portrait of Sayyid Hidayatullah Sadr (illustrated and discussed in Soudavar, Persian Courts, no. 129c, where only Dara Shikoh is mentioned). Counterclockwise from the top and not counting the figure in the top left corner (who may be the son or a disciple of the Sayyid) are Dara Shikoh, Aurangzeb, Murad Bakhsh, and Shah Shuja'. The arrangement suggests Aurangzeb was the one most directly associated with the Sayyid (who was to serve as sadr during his reign; see ibid.), while Dara and Shuja' are shown convers ing with spiritual mentors. Further historical research may help flesh out this suggestion and identify the remaining figures. The top figures are accompanied by white lilies, the middle figures by willows, and the bottom figures by far palms (see Parodi, "Decorazioni"); the other plant varies in each case, but it is generally consistent in color and type, with the remarkable exception of the poppy, which is associated with the purported figure of the Prophet. It may be further noted that the pink tulip in the inner border of the Sackler page is the result of a patch most probably obtained from a LSJA calligraphy page at the time when the album was disassembled and its folios auctioned off. Interestingly, patches of paper with pink tulips were used to repair the inner border of a page of the Nasir al-Din Shah album (Wright, Muraqqa', no. 77). Possibly this is more than a coincidence; perhaps they shared part of their history after dispersal from the Mughal library. This was highlighted in various papers presented at the international workshop Munshis, Pandits and Record-Keepers: Scribal Communities in India, held at the University of Oxford (13-14 June 2008). I raised the issue of painters increasingly entering the "frame of the imperial image" in the age of Jahangir and Shahjahan, a fact that may not only testify to their increased status but also indicate they participated in the more refined circles of Mughal society. Wright, Muraqqa', 64-66. An equally interesting suggestion follows: "In a culture where the talents of the poet were traditionally held in far higher esteem than those of the painter, the paintings perhaps functioned as visual prompts: one quick look at the painting called to mind not only the verses actually on the page, but also those that might originally have preceded or followed it, or other verses by other poets that expressed a similar sentiment" (ibid., 66). While existing scholarship, such as Okada, Ambassadeur, demonstrates the relevance of Shahjahani chronicles for an appreciation of the portraits of his contemporaries, only a broader range of sources, such as tadhkiras, could support an interpretation of other subjects. See for example Akbar's Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, London, Or. 12208), illustrated and discussed in Barbara Brend, The Emperor Akbar's Khamsa of Nizami (London: British Library, 1995). Roxburgh, Persian Album, 323. For a discussion of the relevance of the trope in album prefaces from the Timurid and Safavid period see 293 TWO PAGES FROM THE LATE SHAHJAHAN ALBUM</page><page sequence="28">Roxburgh, Prefacing the Image, 14-17. See especially ibid., 16, which stresses the dominance of poetry in the Persianate literary complex, "with its established rules of meter, rhyme, and structure as well as its constellation of images," and the ensuing "strong intertextuality and referencing of precedent [whereby e]ach work of prose or poetry occupied its place in a sequence of texts that ran backward and forward in time. Parallel creative processes obtained in the arts of calligraphy and depiction [where] newly made works responded and alluded to the art of the past." Roxburgh further suggests that by considering "this aesthetic of familiarity, of repetition and perpetual return, of always already knowing ... we might be in a better position to assess and define the nature of a viewers visual and verbal engage ment with a work in the context of reception and parameters of judgment." 85 Preface to Koch, Mughal Art, xxiii-xxiv. 86 I find here an intriguing parallel with what Losensky points out in Welcoming Fighänl, 142-43: "Although the increas ing predominance of the ghazal has often been noted, it has had little impact on the modern critical assessment of Timurid Turkmen literature. While most scholars recognize that the ghazal was 'by far the most popular poetic genre' of the period, we seldom find examples of this genre quoted or analyzed, and discussions of later Timurid poetics focus largely on rhetorically complex instances of the qaslda and masnavi" 87 The latter two aspects may prove difficult to postulate as a result of the current fragmentary state of material remains for the LSJA, as well as the absence of evidence (which does not constitute evidence of absence) for the existence of a preface, such as those described by Roxburgh, Persian Album, 13. He further warns that "general statements about the purpose of albums [found in their prefaces]—to instruct or to provide visual pleasure and amuse ment by way of recreation—fall short of the mark [as albums were] inherently discursive space[s experienced in social contexts of] which the viewer is remind ed over and over again through the many representations of courtly figures and practitioners engaged in the cultural practices of reading poetry, writing, and discussing" (ibid., 306-307). Whether this can be applied to the albums created for Shahjahan is, of course, open to question. 88 As testified by the Â'în-i Akbarï, translated by H. Blochmann (repr. New Delhi, 1977), 1:114. 89 See for example "Shah Jahan and Orpheus" and other essays contained in Koch, Mughal Art. 90 Seen. 19 above. 91 Humäyünnäma, fol. 27a (Thackston, Three Memoirs, Persian text, 1:22, and English translation, 1:23). While a few scholars have mentioned this reference in passing, no one—at least to my knowl edge—seems to have commented on its implications. In my 2006 essay (Parodi, "Humayuns Sojourn"), before I in my turn realized the importance of this passage, I attempted a more balanced assessment of early Mughal-Safavid cultural relations based on other textual references. 92 It is interesting to note that the word kitàbkhâna has virtually escaped art historians for the reign of Humayun, perhaps because early translators invariably rendered it as "library." Compare the passage in Akbarnäma II, 67, where the child Akbar is said to have drawn figures in Humayuns kitàbkhâna, leaving no doubt that an atelier is LAURA E. PARODI intended. The kitäbkhäna in Dinpanah, the city he founded in Delhi in 1533, is also the place where Humayun met his death shortly after observing the planet Venus. This suggests astronomical treatises may also have been copied there for him. Tadhkira, fols. 81a, b (Thackston, Three Memoirs, Persian text, 1:52, and English translation, 1:129). Humayun apparently had both his library and his painters with him even in the years 1540 to 1545, when he was not in possession of a throne or a stable seat for his court. A few instances are discussed in Parodi, "Humayuns Sojourn." Some of the paintings currently ascribed to other schools (primarily Bukhara and possibly Herat) may in fact be misla beled. I am thinking of its greatest achieve ments, such as Celebrations for Akbar's Circumcision in Khwaja Seyaran (fig. 3) (see n. 19 above). The connection is supported by the fact that surviving materials from Humayuns reign are for the most part individual paintings of the type associated with albums.</page></plain_text>
