According to Mr Jordan, philosophy is the attempt to comprise all available knowledge, then to forget it and eventually to gain a correct world view which will result in active wisdom. "Philosophy is art and not science." "Art is pragmatic, and so is wisdom, and so is philoso- phy." Mr Jordan emphatically rejects philosophy as it is taught generally by departments of philosophy in universities. Writing on his farm in South Africa, he declares that most philosophy of the last hundred generations appears to us as pure speculation, an interesting game of words and nebulous concepts without knowl- edge. "Nearly all former philosophy is naively egocentric and anthropomorphic and starts from the philosopher as the center of the universe." "So this egocentric philosophy, classical and romantic, idealistic or realistic, sounds false and pretentious and utterly obsolete in our ears. Most of it has only museum value." Mr Jordan expresses great respect for Aristotle, who is declared to have searched and inquired into the facts about man and nature in the most ex- emplary fashion. "He is, however, frequently wrong, and his conclusions are in many in- stances as obsolete as the Greek gable on the New York Stock Exchange." Since the time of Aristotle, philosophy has developed an abstrac- tive technique which has resulted in gigantic abstractions. "This faulty technique was first evolved in Alexandria in an age of decreased general stimulation which had inherited a great philosophical tradition." "Many generations have tried in vain to blow life into the stillborn children of Alexandria, whose ghosts still haunt our universities." Mr Jordan is especially scorn- ful of Hegel, "who arrived from the flimsiest and shakiest material at the abstract concept of his dialectical trinity and who then proceeded to force each and every event into the strait jacket of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. It is a concept obviously abstracted from sexual life and reproduction, and it is as erroneous as all concepts based upon the deceptive appearance of sex. It is particularly unfortunate that Marx and Engels should have combined this fantastic nonsense with urgent social problems of their day." Mr Jordan believes that the present age is one of stimulated life, which like the archaic period of ancient Greece offers the prospect for a new philosophy that is thoroughly grounded on the facts of all the sciences. He has studied the fields of physics, chemistry, geology, geography, climatology, biology, anthropology, and so forth. From the facts of science one learns that man belongs to a macrocosm which is the part of the world that we can experience with our senses, aided and unaided. Beyond the macrocosm is the megalocosm of interstellar events and radia- tions; below the macrocosm is the microcosm of the subatomiic world. The macrocosmic world inhabited by man is five dimensional: three dimensions of space, one of time, and one of individuality. "All abstractions -words, con- cepts, ideas, thoughts, speculations, fantasies- are macrocosmic, individual, discontinuous events in our brains." The basic idea of Mr Jordan's New Perspective is that all life is carbon metab- olism which constitutes a thin film in the plane of friction between the surface of our globe and its atmosphere. It is an erroneous idea derived from the machine age, he holds, that life con- tains an immanent force to evolve and a guiding engineer to steer this evolution. Mr Jordan acknowledges the role of causality in the world, but he also stresses the role of accidents and tendencies in events. The evolution of life on earth is nothing but the way life adapts itself to ever changing and never repeated conditions. In the course of evolution there was evolved the intelligent animal, then IIomo sapiens, finally HIomo sapiens socialis. "That man exists, how- ever, as the multicellular phase in a rhythm of multi- and unicellular life where the unicellular phase is biologically the more important could not have been known before our generation." "Mind is the reflective nervous center in action, expressing the whole human individual of which it is a part." "These nerves in action are our mind; they are our imagination, our reflection, our abstraction, our intelligence." "The urge to philosophize is an accidental caprice in the adult form of man, caused by the faculty of conscious reflection and by intellectual activity and by stimulated curiosity, accidentally conditioned further by leisure or by suffering, by a suitable tradition and climate and personal tempera- ment." Most contemporary philosophers refrain from creating speculative abstractions in the grand manner of the past. Mr Jordan's rejection of past philosophical systems might strike a re- sponsive chord in them. But the anti-meta- physical movement in philosophy is also asso- ciated with the logical and semantical analysis of the concepts of science. Such analyses are exemplified in the "Contributions to the Analysis and Synthesis of Knowledge," sponsored by the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 89 Institute for the Unity of Science and published in the Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. (See the review immediately following.) In the judgment of this reviewer the use that Mr Jordan makes of scientific ideas implies an uncritical acceptance of science. Per- haps Mr Jordan would deem contemporary philosophical concern with problems of meaning and denotation as a relic of the faulty technique which he declares to have been initiated in the Alexandrian period of ancient philosophy. Mr Jordan has brought to his task a broad knowledge of all aspects of human activity and presents the results of his self-assured reflective analysis in an aphoristic style. His comments are often fresh and stimulating. To the citations already given may be added the following. "The great and urgent problems of our age are all sociological, arising from the adjustment of the great new masses of men to conditions on earth." "The scale of water management reflects the increase both in the number of men and in the intellectual powers of free surplus energies." "Complete freedom of arts and sciences and competition upon morally neutral fields all com- bine to act as safety valves for much unavoid- able and healthy aggressiveness." "The founda- tion of philosophy is unprejudiced curiosity. Much more philosophy can be found today in some of the geographical magazines than in most of the philosophical ones." V. F.
