<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mïlosao: A Popular and Classical "Lyrical Romance" ARSHI PIPA ABSTRACT The Italo-Albanian poet Girolamo de Rada is a major representative of southern European romanticism. His Milosao (1836) is the poetic diary of a medieval Albanian prince who has fallen in love with a girl of low birth. The "lyrical romance" was lived in part by its author, who wrote it under the double influence of Albanian popular poetry (he was at the time collecting Albanian folk songs in his native village, Macchia, in Calabria) and Greek lyrical poetry (he had just graduated from the Sant'Adriano college, where the study of Greek was emphasized). Milosao is thus a hybrid combining elements from Albanian and Greek cultures and from Italian romantic poetry as well. It is at the same time a highly original work, written in a language that is the more suggestive as it is elliptical and at times even hermetic. (AP) Girolamo de Rada was born in 1814 in Macchia, an Albanian village of Calabria, the son of a Greek Catholic priest. The state- ment needs explanation, since it relates three seemingly disparate concepts in the person of the subject: Italian birthplace, Albanian nationality, and Greek Catholic religion. A minority of more than 300,000 Albanians live in Italy today, mostly in Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, and Sicily.1 They speak Alba- nian and call themselves Arbëresh. Half of them are Catholics of the Greek rite.2 Their ancestors came to Italy beginning with the fif- 336</page><page sequence="2">"milosao" 337 teenth century. During that century, the Albanians, led by their national hero, Scanderbeg, put up a stubborn resistance to the Turkish invasion of their country. Since the Albanians were Chris- tians at that time, their fight for their country was also a fight for their faith. When Albania was overrun by the Turks, many Alba- nians from southern Albania left their country and settled in Italy. There they lived for centuries, proud and distrustful, isolated from the rest of the population, speaking only Arbëresh and preserving jealously their mores and customs. Italy remained to them "the foreign land" from which they hoped to depart one day to their own country, a hope they entertained with epic memories of the bygone glory that had once been the Albania of Scanderbeg and his heroic fellows. Such a life is romantic in itself and it is no wonder that a romantic poetry ante litteram developed among the Italo-Albanians in a popu- lar form. It combined some of the principal ingredients of romanti- cism: praise of chivalric and Christian ideals, nostalgic love of the past, and a sense of estrangement from the surrounding world. The tradition of oral poetry was continued by some talented poets of the nineteenth century, in a period of flourishing romanticism.3 Of this romantic literature de Rada is the leading figure, and his Milosao the highest artistic expression. Milosao was first published in 1836, with the Italian translation facing the Albanian text. Its full title is Poesie albanesi del secolo XV: Canti di Milosao, figlio del déspota di Scutari {Albanian Poems of the Fifteenth Century: Songs of Milosao, the Son of the Despot of Scutari).* The work is, as the title suggests, a collection of lyrics deal- ing with imaginary events which are loosely connected but have a certain development and denouement. The young prince has hardly come home from a stay abroad when he meets a girl with whom he falls in love. The girl is usually referred to by her mother's name, as "the daughter of Cologrea," an indication of her low social origin.5 The subject is thus a varia- tion of the popular as well as romantic theme of Cinderella and the prince. The difference in social status keeps the lovers apart for a long time; Milosao's mother especially is opposed to their marriage. The hero goes to war against the Turks, then returns; his love for the poor girl seems hopeless. Suddenly, an earthquake destroys Scutari, and with it any social and economic differences between the</page><page sequence="3">338 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES two lovers. They abandon their native town in ruins, and the town soon falls into the hands of the enemy. They finally marry and a child is born to them. But Milosao's happiness is short-lived: the child dies, and soon after, his wife also dies. Faithful to the memory of his wife, he never marries again. In his bereavement, however, he becomes more and more melancholy; and toward the end of the story, a sentiment of bitterness for his wife, "the stranger who took him away from his mother/' enters his heart. "Mother" here, as in many other places, stands for "motherland": Milosao's sorrow is in fact his remorse for having abandoned his country in order to be happy with the girl of his heart. The following lines in Canto 28 are the key to this interpretation: Forëmadhe m'ëma ime pat besë me ushtëren Arbërit t'i ndighja; e lja besa e prá vëdiq. My proud mother trusted that I would help [free] Albania by taking the lead of the army. I betrayed her confidence, and she died. Milosao's remorse is thus a case of the classical conflict between love and patriotic duty. The form, however, that his remorse takes is typically romantic: the hero feels a longing for death. Death is invoked to end a life that has been a failure. The last canto shows Milosao among his soldiers - we think he has finally resumed the leadership of his men to free Albania from the Turks. From the tent in which he lies dying, he can (or imagines he can) see Scutari, dis- cern its houses, and smell the odors of its gardens brought to him by the wind as a last salute. In such an atmosphere of homesickness Milosao is said to pass away "as [in] a dream." The tedium of life that nostalgic memories of love exacerbate rather than soothe, the attachment to one's country, and the desire of evasion - such elements in Milosao set this work in the tradition of the kind of European romanticism which may be called aristo- cratic, from René and Corinne to Childe Harold and Ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis* The hero is both a prince and a poet, with a trouba- dour's heart under a Crusader's cuirass. But the work is also romantic in another important aspect, that of democratic romanticism. The prince is princely only in appearance; his behavior, his feelings, and</page><page sequence="4">"MILOSAO" 339 his tastes are really those of a commoner. Only toward the end of the work (in the last six cantos, to be precise) is Milosao depicted as a sophisticated hero brooding moodily on the transiency of life. The rest of the work (which has thirty cantos) shows the hero as a healthy, though sensitive, young man who dallies with his friends and dances with the village girls. The idyllic - but not Arcadian - atmosphere in which the work develops does not prevent him from noticing the plight and poverty of his people. The prayer to the Madonna in Canto 15 asks not only protection for the crops and the herds but also "forgiveness" for "the girls / who do not have enough bread to eat" ("vajzat çë me buk se frighjen"). In Canto 6, the hero, oblivi- ous of his high birth, sings in praise of his girl "of good manners / who was not born in silk sheets" ("Ajo vashë zakón-bukur / se ljeu ndër të mundafshta") and is ready to live with her in an "abandoned cabin." Romanticism delivered popular poetry from the neglect and con- tempt in which it had been held by classical literature, and folklore was found to be the incarnation of the national genius. Milosao has a folkloristic basis. The rhythm of its cantos is the same as that in the Arbëresh folk songs,7 and its ethical substratum reflects the Italo- Albanian way of life. The author may announce in the title that the songs are of Milosao, the prince of Scutari in the fifteenth century; but the toponymy in the text belies the title, for the names of most of the sites are Arbëresh, and Milosao is a hero in the tradition of the epic songs, akin to Nik Peta and Milo Shini (notice Milosao's resem- blance to the latter). Likewise, in Cologrea's daughter every young woman in the village can recognize herself. The religious rites, the beliefs and superstitions, the mores and customs, are those of the Albanian villages of Calabria: boys exercise in the meadows, girls dance in the village square, lovers meet at the fountain or at street corners, men till the soil or tend herds, mothers sing their children to sleep, women work in vineyards and olive groves and at home make bread, weave, and embroider. Such a life is not so much narrated as it is represented in action; the cantos, like the popular songs, abound in dialogue. The charac- ters are popular, mostly farmers and shepherds, and rather than representing social categories, they represent family relationships: parents and children, brothers and sisters, married and betrothed couples, relatives and neighbors. The nobility is strikingly absent; Milosao's father, the Despot of Scutari, is mentioned only in the</page><page sequence="5">340 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES title, while the "Lady" his wife, who is often mentioned, never appears. Life in the palace differs little from life in the cottages; the economic disparities are blurred, and the stern code of ethics is the same for all. The prince must abide by that code as must everybody else; his nobility does not exempt him from the sanctions of public opinion. The only differences in this classless, almost patriarchal community are those between the sexes: the woman is subordinate to the man, more important as a mother than as a wife and impor- tant as a sister little less than as a wife, the sister being considered as the mother's substitute.8 Quite in popular - and partly in romantic - fashion, ghosts, ani- mals, and natural elements appear among the dramatis personae. In Canto 15, Milosao has a conversation with his dead brother, while in Canto 26, the ghost of Milosao's wife appears to his sister. Ani- mals occasionally perform as messengers; for example a dove awakes Milosao in Canto 1, and a partridge feeds his son in Canto 18. Canto 16 consists of a dialogue between the hero and the North Wind. Folkloristic Patterns Popular poetry affects both the structure and style of the work. A comparison of Milosao and Rapsodie di un poema albanese, de Rada's collection of folk songs, shows both that entire cantos of Milosao have been patterned after popular lyric genres and that various popular stylistic devices and movements have been struc- turally incorporated into Milosao.9 Canto 15, for instance, starts with the two lines that also begin a well-known folk song common to both Albanians and Italo- Albanians: "Duro, zëmër, e duro / sa duroj malji me bore" ("Bear, my heart, bear on, / like the mountain that bears the snow"). The canto, which is about marriage, includes another pattern, one on the number nine, which popular belief held sacred: "shkeptin nënt dielaz" ("Nine suns shone") is an echo of the following lines from a folk song that is also about marriage: Ε m'i shtuu te nyynt boor; Prana u dylhiir ditta. Shcheptin e aky diela. (I, 14) Nine times it snowed, then the day cleared up and so many suns shone.</page><page sequence="6">"milosao" S41 The beginning of Canto 13, Prá çë, zot, ké t'na ljësh vash si nj'il çë dritjen nënk bjerr tek udh' e tij, Since, my lord, you are leaving us may you go as a star that loses no light on its way, resembles these lines from the wedding song "Carme nuziale": Porsi t'erdh hera e nissyn Pash ti hee, mòtyra imme, Porsi dieli kour délh. (II, ) Since your time has come and you must leave, may you be, my sister, like a rising sun. The canto and the folk song are both sung by women, except that the former is addressed to Milosao going to war, while the latter is addressed to a bride leaving her parents' home. In Milosao ("Vjersh i se biljes Kologrés"), Cologrea's daughter la- ments the departure of her lover in the following manner: "E nd' at katund ku sonte të m'arrësh / se ké të foljët anë, se ké ti shpi" ("In the city in which you will arrive tonight / you will not find our language, you will not find a home"). In a folk song (I, 12), the same initial movement is found: "Pondy dheet cu ti ty vesh / Triesen cush my t'e shtron" ("In the country to which you are going / who sets the table for you?). A perfect parallelism can also be seen in the closing lines of Canto 16, "Mba tutjè, bushtëra voré, / se më ngrinë eshtërat" ("Away from me, you cruel North Wind, / you have frozen my bones"), and the following lines in the well-known legend of Con- stantine and Garentina (I, 17): "Mba tuttje bùshtra vydèche / Cy m more nyynt bilht" ("Away from me, you cruel death, / who took from me nine sons"). In the same canto, the girl is imagined by the hero as "dancing with a young nobleman"; she is happy, and "her eyes speak": me te bardhethin kopilj ljodnej milordeza . . . e m'i £ jisin sizit. In a popular love song, both the situation and the expression are quite similar: Atje vasha lhoddfnej Ε butty me gn' biir Zotti.</page><page sequence="7">342 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Sishit mech e fisnej trimi Drittysoi aira. (1,2) There the girl was sporting gently with a noble young man. His eyes fixed at her made the air shine. In Milosao one can even discover whole cantos whose patterns are similar to those of folk songs. For instance, the motif in the earth- quake canto (20) seems to be derived from the description of an earthquake in a folk-song elegy on Scanderbeg's death (III, 17). A line from that elegy, "Scanderbeccu s'ysht myy" ("Scanderbeg is no more") is echoed at the end'of Miloaso: "S'ë më e Milosát" ("Milosao is no more").10 A lullaby in Rapsodie (III, 1) has been partly incor- porated in Canto 23.11 The last canto is modeled on an elegy containing the following lines: Tech ciucca e gnij ráhi Nyn heen e gnij lhissi Prapt dèrgkej Deddi Scura, . . . Ezzuni, shoch, ju me shyndét, U me juu as vign myy. (II, 19) On the top of the hill in the shadow of an oak tree Ded Scura was dying. . . . Farewell to you, my companions, I never will be with you again. The popular hero is dying from wounds received by the Turks, exactly like de Rada's hero. Compare the lines above with these from Milosao: Friti erë e maljevet e rrëzoi hén e ljisit: gjaku im te ljumi Vodhit. Ghapni spërvjerin, ushtërtor, se u të shogh Skutarin . . . Më atjè s'zgjonjem. . . . The mountain wind has blown, fallen is the crown of the oak tree, my blood [flows] down the Vodhe River. Open my tent, my warriors, that I may see Scutari . . . There I shall awake no more. . . .</page><page sequence="8">"milosao" 343 Classical Influence De Rada usually calls his compositions "songs" or "odes," and occasionally "idylls" or "pictures." 12 Most of the time his songs are idylls, but not so much in the classical as in the Leopardian sense - the former being descriptive of nature and the latter contemplative moments bearing on natural scenery. It is possible that the Albanian poet read the Canti of the great Italian who spent his last years in Naples at a time when de Rada was studying there ("La ginestra" was composed in the same year in which Milosao was published).13 Traces of Leopardian sentiment can be discovered in the cantos, but they are to be attributed, I think, to the kind of romanticism tem- pered by classical education that was common to both poets. More than once in his prose, de Rada suggests that poetic origi- nality was the objective he pursued during his life. Originality is synonymous with novelty to a great extent, but the novelty de Rada strove for is not absolute; it is, rather, a reshaping of traditional elements. We come thus to the effect classical poetry had on Milosao. We have already seen how de Rada made use of popular poetry by appropriating some of its linguistic and stylistic elements. Classical poetry affected him by its underlying conception of life. According to that naturalistic and aesthetic conception, life may not be a boon, but it is made bearable and enjoyable by the contemplation of beauty. Since beauty resides in the apprehension of forms, in natural phenomena and artificial objects alike, and since nature in its cycli- cal process is the never-ending source of new forms (Lucretius' "daedala tellus"), the perception of those forms refreshes our senses and rekindles our zest for life. Poetry seconds life. Such a conception of poetry underlies the first canto of Milosao, which starts with the following lines: Ljis jeta kishë ndërruar, uj të ri ndë dejtit kaljthëruar te dit'e ré: po lumbardhë e Anakreontit rronej Tempe e moçëme. The earth had changed [its] oak trees, new waters in the sea [were] made blue in the new day. But the dove of Anacreon was living in Tempe as of old. The poet then tells us how the dove (a symbol of erotic poetry as</page><page sequence="9">344 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES well as a real bird) came from the valley of Tempe to the "Greek Sila" to awake the poet.14 The dove awakes him kúr te drita dheu me shpi u sbuljua, je dejti, si gharea çë delj per sish.15 when the earth with houses and the sea revealed themselves in the light like joy radiating from the eyes. The time of the year is early summer, "the grapes are almost ripe" in the vineyards, the flax plant is in bloom. The poet contemplating this scenery becomes "oblivious of human sorrows" ("Ti ruaje e se kultonje/një mbuinë njerëzish"). The catharsis, however, is achieved with the concurrence of an affective element: Milosao's delight in being back home from "the foreign land." The stress on home, especially in its ethnic development, brings us back to romanticism. The naturalistic spirit that pervades the work is most apparent in Canto 29, which is quoted here in its entirety: Ujtë ghumbur, rá vorea, malje e sheshe u veshëtin. U si udhë e ëgjëlit, verë, të shogh e trëmbjem. Djaljëri çë jetën bushtër nëng njoghu më të qeshën, si shtjerrat ndë barishtet. Degë e trëntafiljevet shkundën shithin mb'ajrit, vashës i mbjon këshetëthin çë piksi me jothi, mbjon djaljë e gjitònjes çë i ljuan te prëghëri. Ajo e puthën e më nkuqet se f jantaksën djaljë e malit çë asaj t'i ljeghej. Butën peljat se t'i hipinj, pendët zogjëvet i shkuljën burri, kriet për të stoljisur; si vorea përthajti ljuljet shakëmizën sheshe sirk, një të veshurë të bënj. Fanmirë ndë piksnej rrëmpat e dielitl Vera më e magjepsënith: ljulje të bardha, ljulje të verdha,</page><page sequence="10">"milosao" 345 të përghapta t'vjerra dojn goljen sá t'i f jisinl The showers ceased, the North Wind fell, mountains and fields are dad in green. I look at you, Spring, as at the angel's path, and am afraid. The youth unaware of cruel life smile at you, like lambs in the meadows. The rose branches shake off their drops in the wind, they fall on a girl's hair entwined with violets, they fall on the neighbor's child playing in her lap. She kisses him and blushes imagining her own child born of love. Man tames the mares to ride them, plucks feathers from the birds to adorn his head, dries out flowers like the North Wind, destroys acres of silkworm to make himself a garment. Happy if he knew how to weave the rays of the sun. Spring charms him more: flowers white and yellow pendant and open lack only voice to speak to him. The lyric is composed of two parts, the first of which contains Leopardian accents (as in "La quiete dopo la tempesta"), while the other half presents striking affinities with the first antistrophe from the second chorus of Sophocles' Antigone: The light-witted birds of the air; the beasts of the weald and the wood [Man] traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood. Master of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart Who roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art; And the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.16 This chorus, which celebrates the powers of man, is analyzed by Heidegger as an example of his thesis that poetry is an expression of "the being of the strangest being": the violent one who trans- gresses his own limitations, disrupts the natural order, and sub- jugates other beings by means of violence and guile.17 De Rada, on</page><page sequence="11">346 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the other hand, is not praising man for his conquests over the rest of the world; he is, rather, expressing regret that man destroys nature to achieve civilization. The romantic theme of contrasting nature and civilization appears at this point, but the theme is developed by means of classical imagery. It is possible that de Rada, who was conversant with Greek poetry, derived his reflections on man's ingeniousness from Sophocles. The affinities, however, between the two poets can probably be better explained by reference to the cultures to which they belonged. The pagan joy of life, which Christianity in the Mediterranean countries diverted but could not quench, resounds in Milosao despite some overtones of melancholy and weitschmerz. The Greek sarcophagi contain bas-reliefs with figures singing and dancing, as well as scenes of everyday life such as those depicting the tilling of the soil, the gathering of grapes, or the hunting of beasts. Milosao's farewell to life in the last canto - a final hymn to life - is in this pagan spirit although the form is romantic. The oak tree has shed its leaves, the river flows into the sea carrying the hero's blood; he "shall awake no more / among the flowers that the wind moves." The images of the oak tree, the flowers, the water, the wind, are all present, as they were at the beginning of the work; but now there is no more awakening, for the cycle has ended. Original Language and Technique Having shown the influence of the Albanian popular poetry and that of Greek poetry on the genesis of Milosao, we now approach the work as the product of an authentic poetic experience - as the efflorescence of de Rada's personal genius. The language of the work (which to a great extent accounts for its originality), its imagery, and its style is examined here with the intention of arriving at a defini- tion and explanation of the author's technique and his conception of poetry. The first line of Milosao contains an image most indicative of that conception, that of an oak tree as a resistant and long-lasting tree. To measure the ages of the earth by the duration of oak trees is to measure time on earth by its own yardstick, just as the time of day is measured by the shadow of a stick. The image in this case defines, not merely illustrates or describes, the essence.</page><page sequence="12">"MISSÃO" 347 In Canto 11 the girl's sadness (which is prompted by the people who envy her happiness) is likened to si një qeljqë ndë m'i frinë bjerr të feksurit te vogha, porsa mbrënta lamparisën. a glass which loses its luster when one blows on it but shines inward. The girl's state of mind could hardly be expressed more adequately: her sadness is the result of her exposure to the world, but inwardly she is happy because she is in love. The image at the beginning of Canto 7 is more complex: Dreq rehet e detit gëzoi dita e kaljthërëz valevet kopiljvet. . . . Toward the hills and the sea the blue day exulted at the girls dancing. . . . The image is dynamic: a torrent of light inundates the sky in the direction of the hills overlooking the sea; in the hills, girls are danc- ing. The phrase "blue day" is an instance of syntactic condensation, since it means "daylight irradiating the blue sky." "Toward the hills and the sea" means "toward the hills overlooking the sea," and is therefore a case of parataxis involving ellipsis. The movement of light is perceived in synchronization with the dancing movements of the girls. The synchronization is made by means of the verb "exult," which logically refers to the dancing movements but syntactically appears as a predicate to "light." By this device de Rada is able to link nature and mankind, thus conveying his poetic idea of an unbroken continuity from the former to the latter. The syntactic order of the sentence indicates that de Rada's conception of life is naturalistic, not anthropomorphic: nature is first and then comes man, found in nature as part of it. The poet's communion with nature is, as we know, a characteristic of romanticism in general; but de Rada's feeling for nature, unlike that of romanticism in general, is not an emotion coloring a natural object: it is a perception of the natural object by the perceiving subject so as to make subject and object coincide. Such poetry is proof that de Rada was seeking a means of expression that was new</page><page sequence="13">348 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES for his times. The beginning of Canto 8 is an example of such perceptive poetry: Mnizë e verës bardhulore biu një ré monosaqe për ndër mest gurëvet: kanë gharé te shtrushi ljumit. Pá një ré malji me bore i buthtonet njerëzvet; ata ljutënjën të korrat. Si thelëza te foljea u pushonj ndë kët dimër. Ngrejti degë ulliri shkundur. . . . Promise of the white summer, a bunch of violets has grown among the stones; they rejoice at the river's murmuring. The cloudless mountain [white] with snow reveals itself to men; they pray for a [good] harvest. Like a partridge in her nest I repose in this winter. The branches of the shaken olive tree rise up. . . . The lyrical landscape is painted with rapid brush strokes; no com- ment accompanies the direct rendering of the natural phenomena, which are, however, perceived in consonance with the human heart. The only subjective note ("I repose") refers to the habits of animal life (the partridge in her nest), while the next image is taken from the realm of vegetation and brings the naturalism of the lyric to a sharp point. The term of comparison is omitted this time, but we have no difficulty understanding that the olive tree- devoid of its fruit, not of its ever-green leaves, and with its boughs raised toward the sky - portrays the poet in a moment of contemplation, free from "human sorrows." Such poetic effects are achieved by means of a minimum of vocabu- lary, which is, however, subject to special techniques. De Rada describes Milosao's style as "bare and active." 18 The description is most pertinent. What he calls "bare," today we call "essential": an extreme case of verbal concision and condensation, which may at times result in obscurity. De Rada's obscurity is in great part the consequence of an adopted stylistic device: ellipsis. Elliptical expres- sions have been already encountered in lines and passages quoted so far.19</page><page sequence="14">"milosao" 349 An elliptic style entails fragmentary composition. Those who have criticized Milosao for being fragmentary do not seem to be aware that the work is a "lyrical romance" ("romanzo lirico"), not a narra- tive poem.20 The work does not purport to be a chronologically or- dered sequence of events linked together into a story, but only the record of some significant moments of that story. The moments are lyrical fragments in their own right; narrative is the framework into which they are collected. Like all true poets, de Rada knew by instinct that the genuine poetic voice may have little range but must have a unique tone, the verbal translation of a deep and all- pervading feeling. That feeling in Milosao is one which comes from a total openness to the outside world, perceived especially in its beautiful aspects. The word "joy," which indicates that feeling, recurs in Milosao again and again. This is how Cologrea's daughter expresses it ("Vjersh i se biljës Kologrés"): "Si pá ftes u xheshem te shtrati / e zëgjonem e gharepsur se u zëgjova" ("Like one who is innocent I undress [and lie] in my bed / and awake happy because I awake"). The delight of being in love could not be expressed in simpler words and yet with a directness and impact that cut across the very meta- physics of life. This is the language one imagines a plant or an ani- mal would use, had they that ability, to announce its awakening to the light of day. Milosao compares his joy for coming home from "the foreign land" to that of a virgin" feeling her breasts swelling": kúr vajza e ngroghët ndien për të parëzën sist çë i frighjen. Now, the swelling of a woman's breasts is perfectly analogous to the swelling of a plant's buds by its lymph: the human being is thought of as essentially vegetal. The language is so pertinent to this concept of life that it seems to have grown out of life itself, as a flower buds and blooms upon its stalk. It is, indeed, a language of flowers: M'u pataksa e ruata jashtin. Rrusht pak skalankurë dheut ënë i kinë hé; ljulje ljiu të hapura, nd'era i tundën e përzien, nd'at ninulj qeshënjën. (Canto 1) I leaped to my feet and looked outside: the grape vines almost ripe</page><page sequence="15">350 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES adorned the land; the blooming flax plants as the breeze rocked and mingled them smiled in that lullaby. The flax flowers "rocked by the breeze" recall movements of dance; their "mingling" suggests the display of colors on a canvas; the flowers speak a language of gestures and hints. On the other hand, the "smiling" of the flowers is an example of the language of signs. Such gestures and signs stand here for words - expressive media constituting a kind of vegetal primer. Canto 29 (quoted in full above) spells out this idea: flowers white and yellow pendant and open lack only voice to speak. . . . In conclusion, the peculiar nature of Milosao is a composite one. It represents an Ionian Sea culture to which three civilizations have contributed: Greek, Italian, and Albanian. If Albania was de Rada's country of origin and Italy his adopted one, Greece was his ideal country, just as it was for Foscolo and Hölderlin. It is not an acci- dent that Milosao bears as an epigraph these lines from Pindar's third Olympian ode: Thus the Muse stood by me who found the glorious way to adjust the voice to the Dorian mode. Arshi Pipa · University of Minnesota NOTES 1. According to the 1901 census, there were 81 Albanian settlements, with a population of about 200,000 (Giuseppe Schirò, Storia delta letteratura albanese [Milan, 1959], p. 18). The Annuario statistico dei comuni italiani ([Rome, 1958] pp. 47-50, 80-81) lists 36 settlements, with a total population of 10334. Not included in this list, however, are a number of villages that were not of commune status. Domenico Zangari (Le colonie italo-aibanesi di Calabria, storia e demo- grafia, secoli XV-XIX [Naples, 1941], pp. 48-50) lists 36 localities in Calabria alone. Georges Nicholas Nasse (The I talo -Albanian Villages of Southern Italy [Washington, D.C., 1964]) lists 44 localities of which 42 are albanophones. With regard to religion, 21 follow the Greek rite and 23 the Latin rite. The statistical tables at the end of Fjalor i Arbëreshvet Vitalise (Dizionario degli Albanesi d'ltalia) by Emanuele Giordano (Bari, 1963) gives 55 localities that speak Albanian (with a total population of 135,811) and 40 localities that speak Italian (with a total of 182,182). According to Giordano, the number of Italo-Albanians reaches</page><page sequence="16">"milosao" 351 317,993. He states in a note that his statistical data come from Annuario générale del Touring club italiano of 1961. Considering that the 1901 census has a figure of about 200,000, Giordano's data based on the Italian Touring Club statistics of 1961 make sense. 2. Their church, which is united with the Roman Catholic Church, is or- ganized in two dioceses with centers in Lungro in Calabria, and in Piana degli Albanesi in Sicily. 3. Besides de Rada, the most important are Gabriele Dara, Giuseppe Serembe, Giuseppe Schirò. 4. The work had two other editions, in 1847 and 1873, which are alterations of the original. For this reason, only the original is considered here. Our quotes are from Girolamo de Rada, / Canti di Milosao, ed. Giuseppe Gradilone (Florence, 1965). 5. "Kalogrea" means "nun/* "sister in charity, in Greek. The phrase means "the poor woman's daughter." 6. Mme de Staël's Corinne was one of the favorite books of young de Rada, along with Ariosto's Orlando furioso, Tasso's Gerusalemme liberate and Guarini's II pastor fido. De Rada read also Byron, and there can be no doubt that Foscolo's Ultime lettere was well-known to him (see Girolamo de Rada's partial auto- biography, Autobioloina, 4 vols. fNaples, 1898-18991, 1, 12-13). 7. The rhymeless Arbëresh verse is basically octosyllabic and can be lengthened or shortened by one or more syllables, whereas the proper Albanian octosyllabic line is a rhymed trochaic tetrameter. I suspect that the loose rhythmic texture of the Arbëresh verse is the result of the influence exercised by Italian prosody and especially by the national Italian verse, which is an iambic endecasyllable. 8. The Albanian word for "sister" is "rnoter," which is cognate with "mater." The characteristically Albanian cult of the sister appears in the first canto ("From the foreign land / 1 had come back to my sisters") and reappears in the last one ("Open my tent, / my warriors, that I see / Scutari and my sister"). 9. Girolamo de Rada, Rapsodie di un poema albanese (Florence, 1866; photo- static éd. [Editrice Casa del Libro], Cosenza, 1964). The parenthetical references in my text use roman numerals to refer to the four sections of the volume, arabic numerals to refer to the songs within a section. De Rada not only collected but also arranged and commented upon (in collaboration with Niccolò de' Coronei) the Rapsodie. Not seldom he retouched the songs, at times omitting whole lines and at other times adding his own. To this conclusion one comes by comparing variants of the same song in Rapsodie and in other folkloristic collec- tions. Suffice here an example. The well-known poem whose theme is the recogni- tion of the sister by her brother is found in the oldest text containing Italo- Albanian popular poems, the so-called Manuscript of Chieuti (eighteenth century). There the poem starts: The girl who was gathering flowers on the plains of Anápolis all day gathered flowers. When the silent hour came, she made them into a bouquet. Ah, poor mel Darkness has fallen now on the mountain, this solitary mountain. In Rapsodie (III, 23), the corresponding passage reads: In the sad rays of the setting sun</page><page sequence="17">352 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the girl was gathering flowers; she gathered the new violets in the plain of Corone. She gathered flowers and sang her sad fate. De Rada's variant has two romantic lines lacking in the other text. On the other hand, two lines from the Chieuti Manuscript do not appear in de Rada's variant. Again, the original name of the place in which the story occurs, Anápolis in Greece, has been changed to that of Corone. If one reads the rest of the poem, other discrepancies appear. The Chieuti text is straightforward, concise, with a dramatic movement; whereas de Rada's text contains elaborate lyrical expressions and many epithets. An important detail shows definitively that de Rada has retouched the original. When the girl is asked by her brother to identify herself, she answers simply: "I stem from a noble family." De Rada has instead: "My family is most distinguished, / it stems from the lords of Mirdita." Now, Mirdita is a region in Northern Albania and there is no trace of the lords of Mirdita in the Italo-Albanian folklore; only de Rada, who was conversant with the history of Albania, could know of that region. Clearly, de Rada's variant is in part his version. The same holds true for many other poems in the collection. And so our comparison between the Rapsodie and Milosao risks misleading in part. But only in part, for there is no doubt that some at least of the stylistic patterns found in both works are of popular origin. 10. The derivation of the earthquake motif from the popular elegy is con- firmed by the canto's modified text in the second edition of Milosao, which reproduces the apocalyptic atmosphere in the elegy, including such details as the splitting of the mountains and the collapsing of the belfry. 11. This is the lullaby as it appears in Rapsodie: A wind blows, a soft tiny whirlwind, it pushes the door open gently and rocks my baby in his cradle. It rocks him, it awakes him. Here I am, my son, the dance is over, your mother comes back to you. She comes with fingers full of rings, her neck full of flowers, she gives you her breast and puts you to sleep. De Rada prefaces this lullaby with the explanation that, most probably, the birth of a son has come to crown the happiness of the protagonists in the pre- vious stories (namely, the songs preceding this lullaby in Rapsodie, III). In Canto 23, we are told of Milosao's happiness, which is crowned by the birth of his son: I married the one whom I loved, the girl with the beautiful figure, a child was born who takes after her. Happy in my house she rocks him while embroidering my belt. The affinities between this canto and the lullaby are so evident that I suspect de Rada retouched the text of the popular song with this canto in mind. If this is true, the contaminatio would be a striking instance of the characteristically romantic conception of popular poetry as collaborative result. 12.

De Rada never mentions Leopardi in his Autobiologia, although he men- tions other nineteenth-century poets such as Monti and Foscolo (I, 13). 14. Sila is the mountain in Calabria at whose feet are located six Albanian villages and towns, including Macchia. "Greek Sila" is an expression used by Norman Douglas in his Old Calabria (London, 1938), referring to the Albanian Greek Catholics inhabiting those localities. 15. Cf.
