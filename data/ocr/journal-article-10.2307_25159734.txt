This was almost wholly due to the special loan exhibition program. Four major exhibitions were shown-5,000 Years of Korean Art, Old Master Paintings from the Collection of Baron Thyssen Bornemisza, The Realist Tradition: French Painting and Drawing, 1830-1900, and The 61st May Show. Another, Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting, was a joint project with the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum and opened in Kansas City before coming here in early 1981. There were also significant exhibitions in the Prints and Drawings galleries-Crosscurrents: Neoclassical Drawings and Prints from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, Thomas Moran's Watercolors of the American West, and Connoisseurship in Italian Figural Composition. In addition seven smaller, Museum originated, exhibitions were held in the classroom level exhibition area; four of them complemented major loan exhibitions. While all of these involved the staff in the usual logistics, the Realist Tradition and Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting re quired the production of major catalogs resulting from years of preparation. Includ ing the special lectures during the international symposium held in connection with The Realist Tradition, there were thirty-one guest lectures. Add to this twenty-seven major musical programs and forty organ recitals as well as other exhibitions, publi cations-such as the four Themes in Art series titles-programs, courses, and more, and the magnitude of the 1980 activities becomes clear. Attendance remained close to the pattern of recent years-461,564. In blacker moments some of us may think of Thomas Mann's image in The Magic Mountain of tubercular fever as an index of modern discontent as barely adequate to describe the hectic pace of the year. In a lighter mood one might recall the insistence of Lewis Carroll's White Queen on running as fast as possible so as to remain in the same place. But the lighter moods pass only too soon in the face of the very real demands made by this hyperactive program on limited amounts of time, money, and energy. In 1873 Walter Pater suggested that "All art constantly aspires towards the condi tion of music." In 1980 one might suggest that the visual arts encompassed by the art museum aspired to the condition of the performing arts. Clearly the immobility of paintings, sculptures, and the so-called minor arts, disturbs late twentieth-century people or at least, is considered uncongenial. As a result the objects are moved about and put into performances which have beginnings and endings and a box office suc cess measurable either by admission fees or simple attendance figures. I have noted on numerous occasions that neither Time, nor Newsweek, nor even The New Yorker, has a regular, weekly section on the visual arts in contrast to the regular treatment of theater, movies, music, and books. When support of the arts is discussed, the per forming arts are center stage. As an aside, this is fortunate, for the practitioners of 223</page><page sequence="3">those arts are far more articulate than those expounding the merits of inanimate objects. Still, we simply must recognize that the level of activity in 1980 was abnormal and should represent an inadvertent high tide. It would never have been reached at all without the project aid of both Federal Endowments-Arts and Humanities-and the operating support from the Ohio Arts Council, used by this Museum solely for public programs, special exhibitions, and lectures in particular. But these funds pay only the external costs and take no heed of the added load on the minds and bodies of the staff at all levels that must be carried if these special programs are to attain the quality we have come to expect. In retrospect we should look on this decade's in creasing activity as a variation on a "Great Leap Forward," followed by a period of consolidation to begin without delay. One result of hectic 1980 was the delay of several permanent collection projects which are only now, at the time of writing this report, nearing completion-notably a new and safer installation of the Louis XV bed along with its embroidered coverlet by Phillipe de la Salle and a new and clearer installation of the important collection of English gold coins given some years ago by Mrs. R. Henry Norweb. Numerous other such delays can be cited. All of this is a cautionary tale, told because it must be, since 1980 was such an active and largely successful year. The June Bulletin detailed the acquisitions of 1980 so there is no need to elaborate those activities here. The bequest of Noah L. Butkin, however, should be noted because of its particular character and generous size, as it gives quite a new dimension to the Museum's nineteenth-century holdings in painting and sculpture. One wishes, nevertheless, that this bequest would have been far in the future, for the loss of our Trustee, Mr. Butkin, is a grievous one. The Junior Council is to be congratulated and thanked, not only for their usual general support, but in particular for their sponsorship of the lecture series on Korean art and for their volunteer activities at both the Information and Sales Desks. The large number of visitors make these volunteer positions especially important for the Museum's relationship with its various publics. For all this help we are most grateful. Very special attention should be given to the achievements of the members of the Publications Department in 1980. In addition to continuing the high standards of the Bulletin, they saw through the press two major book-catalogs, The Realist Tradi tion (by Gabriel P. Weisberg) and Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting. All this was achieved at the same time that other catalogs, Themes in Art series titles, and ex hibition guides were being published.

That exhibition, with its comprehensive catalog, was organized by the Curator of Art History and Education and proved to be a major contribution to knowledge, not only of a little-studied area of nineteenth-century French painting but also of the socio-artistic climate of France prior to the rise of Impressionism. International interest was demonstrated by the success of the symposium held here November 15-17 and by the fact that the exhibition travels to Brooklyn, St. Louis, and Glasgow. The Department of Musical Arts had an especially active season and its Gala Subscription series, now only in its second year, has begun to shine as one of the highlights of the active music scene in Cleveland. The yearly growth of the Library in both titles and services, as well as the necessary expansion of the Museum's Conservation Department, has made it only too evident that some judicious expansion of the Museum's physical plant is necessary. The Trustees commissioned the Cleveland architectural firm of Dalton, van Dijk, Johnson &amp; partners to design and produce complete drawings and specifications for a new Library wing at the west side of the present building-between the two stair and elevator towers of the 1958 wing. These have been finished and now await the orga nization of a capital fund raising campaign before they can be implemented. Staff and Trustees alike look forward to the accomplishment of this much needed project, which will also provide modest additions to the gallery space allotted to nineteenth and twentieth-century Western art. The financial report again demonstrates the sound base from which the Museum operates. The Trustees, after careful study, have retained two financial consultants for Museum investment policy-National City Bank and Alliance Capital Manage ment Corporation. The most optimistic but prudent projections of future income, however, do not include sufficient funds to cover the additional operating expenses required by any physical expansion. Even if no additional space were contemplated, the fiscal erosion caused by inflation makes it absolutely necessary to enlarge the Museum's endowment funds for operations. All funds not largely restricted to acquisitions or special purposes, such as book purchases, musical programs, or lec tures, are used for operations. And more will be needed in the future simply to main tain the high standards of this institution's present services to the region and to the world of art. The annual meeting of the Board of Trustees ratified the retirement of Lewis C. Williams as President and the election of James H. Dempsey, Jr., as his successor. Mr. Williams will continue as a Trustee and member of the Executive Committee. His ten years of service will be warmly remembered by all as one of an ideal combina tion of growth and harmony. Alton W. Whitehouse was elected as chairman of the Finance Committee to succeed A. Dean Perry after twelve years of successful leader ship in this important position. 225</page><page sequence="5">There were several major changes in the staff of the Museum. A. Beverly Barksdale retired after ten years of cheerful and able fulfillment of the responsibilities of General Manager. Albert J. Grossman, Operations Administrator, a thirty-two year indis pensible incumbent, was appointed Assistant Director for Operations and Finance, while William Talbot, Associate Curator of Paintings, became Assistant Director for Administration. A much needed replacement for William D. Wixom, formerly Chief Curator of Early Western Art, was found in the person of Patrick M. de Winter. Changes in Trustees, staff, programs, collections, and indeed in all of the appurten ances of this art Museum are both inevitable and desirable. The conditioning require ments of suitability and reasonableness for change, however, are appropriate to a museum, an institution dedicated to the conservation of our now world-wide and time-free traditions. This Museum's reputation for excellence in its four major responsibilities-collection, conservation, display, and elucidation-is due to the support of its friends and intimates and the dedication of its Trustees and staff. As we enter our sixty-fifth year, we owe all who have made our record possible much thanks and the fervent hope for continued and sympathetic support. SHERMAN E. LEE, Director The President, Vice Presidents, and Treasurer are in frequent contact with members of the professional staff and the other members of the Board of Trustees. The com position of the Board changes periodically; six new members were appointed during the ten years that I have been privileged to serve as President. This "younger group" -which includes George M. Humphrey II, Mrs. Edward A. Kilroy, George Oliva, Jr., Mrs. Seth C. Taft, Alton W. Whitehouse, Jr., and Dr. Norman W. Zaworski will have an increasing impact on the Museum's development in both conventional and progressive areas. It has been a genuine pleasure to work with this group as well as our more senior Trustees. The next ten years have every prospect of being a fruitful and exciting period for this museum. A solid base for further growth has been established by our present staff. The Cleveland Museum of Art has every reason to be listed among the top museums of our country. The present Board of Trustees is fully qualified to insure that this status will continue for the balance of the 1980s, and I am sure they will do so. LEWIS C.

During those years, the Museum acquired twenty-five works of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art, most of which were fitted into the existing galleries one by one. With this many additions over a period of years Gallery 9, which holds the small classical objects, seemed not only crowded but rather disjointed. For this reason several months in 1980 were devoted to building new cases for Gallery 9 and redesigning the display. Greek vases and separ ately Greek, Etruscan, and Roman small-scale sculptures are now presented in chronological order to clarify the develop ment of styles. Coins and small pieces of classical jewelry have been placed very close to the case fronts so that the viewer may examine them easily. In some display cases objects portraying similar subject matter, but of different materials or media, are juxtaposed for comparison and contrast of style and tech nique. Additions and adjustments were also made, on a lesser scale, to the Egyptian and Near Eastern galleries. The other major project for the year centered on the ad vance preparations for the 1981 exhibition of a collection of ancient animal figures. Belonging to Leo Mildenberg of Zurich, the more than 240 objects come from Egypt, the Near East, and the classical world. A few small but very fine objects entered the ancient col lection. Perhaps the two most remarkable are the Egyptian bronze Kneeling Priest of Amun with its attentuated forms and delicately worked drapery and the large Luristan bronze horse bit with cheekpieces in the form of elegant winged ibexes. The Museum also acquired the upper half of a very fine and very rare Middle Kingdom hematite shawabti, or funerary statuette. Donors were exceptionally generous to this Department in 1980. Cyril and Jessica Aldred of Edinburgh, Scotland, sent a beautiful, tiny blue faience frog with red eyes as a mate for the miniature cornelian frog already on exhibition. Vivian Merrin of New York donated an elegant Greek bronze libation dish. Mr. and Mrs. Max Ratner of Cleveland gave a set of bone inlays in the shape of birds which once decorated a cosmetic box. These little birds very possibly come from the area of Jericho and are the only Bronze Age objects from Israel in the collection. John Herrmann, Assistant Curator in the Department of Classical Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, discovered that a group of Roman marble sculptures in this Museum since 1916-including a table, a fountain, and four herms-had been excavated near Pompeii along with painting fragments that are now in the Boston Museum. In order to reunite these pieces, Cleveland de-accessioned them and sold them to Boston. The Ancient Art Department turned over the respon sibility for Islamic Art to the Textile Department. The Department sent loans to two important exhibitions: the Sardinian bronze warrior and bull appeared in Art and Culture in Sardinia in Karlsruhe and Berlin, and the Archaic Greek kouros in Images of Man in Berlin. Visitors included Richard DePuma (University of Iowa), K. Patricia Erhart (University of Southern California), Jay Gates (The Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, Memphis), Sidney M. Goldstein (The Coming Museum of Glass), John Herr mann (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), Kurt Luckner (The Toledo Museum of Art), Leo Mildenberg (Zurich), David Gordon Mitten (Harvard University), Helen Murray (The Griffith Institute, Oxford), and Jon van de Grift (Columbia University). The Department was greatly enhanced by the addition of Jenifer Neils, Assistant Curator (part-time) and Assistant Professor at Case Western Reserve University (part-time) through a special grant from the Mellon Foundation. Dr. Neils is a graduate of Bryn Mawr College and has received graduate degrees from the University of Sydney and Princeton University. Especially interested in ancient painting, she has archaeological excavation experience in Italy and Greece. In December she read a paper on Greek vase painting at the annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America at New Orleans. The Associate Curator in Charge, Arielle P. Kozloff, gave the following lectures: The Painters of Dynasty xvIII (Staten Island, in March); The First 4,000 Years: The Ratner Collec tion of Judaean Antiquities (Portland, in October). In March she visited museums and archaeological sties in Israel and throughout the year traveled to Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Coming, and Boston to see collec tions and dealers and to do research. In November she traveled to Egypt with staff from the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery and the "Memphis-in-May" organizers to advise in the selec tion of objects from the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, for an ex hibition in Memphis, Tennessee. In May she retired as pres ident of the Cleveland Society of the Archaeological Institute of America. 228</page><page sequence="8">EARLY WESTERN ART Few but selective additions were made to the collections for which this Department is responsible. Foremost in importance is a majestic Corpus domini from Romanesque France. Finely carved and with still some of its original polychrome, our Crucified Saviour is an outstanding example of the spiritual ized art of the twelfth century and is akin to the sculpture of the great tympania of Vezelay and Autun. A devotional panel by the Sienese painter Nerrocio de' Landi was added to our early Renaissance gallery. Here, the Madonna is represented in three-quarter length, hands clasped, contemplating the nude Christ Child who, sitting on a ledge paralleling the pic ture plane, is blessing the beholder. With its fluid lines and contrasts between subtle and sharp tones, this picture exempli fies the mannered elegance of the late Quattrocento while con veying the introspective devotional spirit of this period. With the accession of a seventh-century Anglo-Saxon bronze fibula -an impressive cross-shaped pin with potent anthropomor phic forms-made, no doubt, to be worn by a proud chieftain, the Department enlarged its still modest but distinguished holdings of migration period ornaments. Two most welcome gifts broadened our collection of Renaissance bronze plaquettes. A very fine cast of the Presen tation in the Temple in a classical setting produced by the prolific North Italian sculpture Moderno was given by Dr. and Mrs. Sherman E. Lee. A round plaquette representing Leda and the Swan, was presented by the Blumka Gallery of New York. This last piece, with figures in high relief and rather lyrical in mood, can probably be assigned to a South German artist working in Augsburg or Nuremburg in the mid-sixteenth century. Through the generosity of an anonymous lender, the Early Western Art galleries have been enhanced by a distinguished group of rare panel paintings, sculpture, and objects ranging from the eighteenth century BC to the fourteenth century AD. The Department lent a precious sixteenth-century soft paste plate to the exhibition Firenze e la Toscana dei Medici nell'Europa del Cinquencento, held in Florence, while a small German bronze of the mid-fifteenth century was bor rowed by The Cloisters, New York, for a show entitled The Wild Man: Medieval Myth and Symbolism. On May 27 Patrick M. de Winter became Curator of the Department, replacing William D. Wixom, who had left in April 1979. The holder of a Ph.D. in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, Dr. de Winter took his M.A. and Bachelor's degrees from Columbia Uni versity. He has taught at Rutgers University, Barnard Col lege and the Brussels International School. A specialist in the painting and sculpture of the International Gothic style of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, he has published noted articles in those fields. In the interim period, Philippe Verdier served as consulting curator. In the last few months of his curatorship, Dr. Verdier did research both in the British Museum and the British Library. In May he lectured at the Pierpont-Morgan Library, New York, on the reliquaries of the True Cross in twelfth-century Mosan Art. In October he joined the curatorial staffofthe Menil Foundation in Houston. The Curator of Paintings, Ann T. Lurie traveled to Europe, New York, Washington, and many other cities in order to do research and visit dealers, archives, and museums. She also coordinated the four-day orientation course for new Junior Council members given by curators and various department heads. Dr. de Winter, who worked at reorganizing the Department, traveled to Europe in the late summer in connection with the Medici show. He was in New York in October on Museum business. That same month, he attended the Byzantine Con ference Studies held at Oberlin College. LATER WESTERN ART From the most generous bequest of Noah L. Butkin thirty nine paintings entered the Later Western Art Department's collection. One of the most singular among these works is a Study of Rams' Heads by the seventeenth-century Dutch painter, Nicolaes Berchem. The Butkin bequest is especially important for increasing our ability to show the variety and accomplishment of French painting of the nineteenth cen tury. Among the landscapes were an unusual stark alpine view by Jean-Leon Ger6me, a colorful Italian farm scene by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and a Rosa Bonheur painting of wild boars in a snowy wood. From an era of great industrial growth came a view of a factory with a tall smokestack by Antoine Chintreuil and the age of cast iron is evoked in Building an Elevated Railway by Paul Trouillebert. Among the Butkin pictures were examples of the nineteenth century interest in themes related to antiquity. Dream of Happiness by Pierre Paul Prud'hon depicts a boat occupied by languid figures, both classically nude and draped. Two oval overdoors of mythological figures borne by fantastic beasts were painted by William Adolphe Bouguereau. Religious allegory found strong expression in Octave Tassaert's Heaven and Hell with its dramatic fall of the damned. Battle painting is represented by a mounted Turk slaying a fallen Greek in a picture by Horace Vernet and the death of a French general by Jean Victor Schnetz. Thomas Couture painted a repentant Pierrot with Harle quin playing learned counsel before two sleeping judges in a witty and deft satire. More sombre with its rough earthy quality is Theodule Ribot's portrait of an old blind beggar 229</page><page sequence="9">jealously clutching his pot of wine while a sly urchin prepares to suck the contents through the spout with a straw. Among the French artists who revived still-life painting at mid-century were Philippe Rousseau, Adolphe Cals, and Francois Bonvin. A canvas by each in the Butkin bequest brings a variety of subject but consistently high quality to the Museum collection. The Cobbler's Quarters by Jean Alphonse Duplessy shows the disorder of an artisan's domestic place of work with meticu lous attention to details. The 1851 portrait of the painter Leo Lehman by his son Rudolf is the one German painting in the Butkin bequest and shows an artist in formal dress drawing with a chalk holder. Monsieur Martin, a veterinarian in Cherbourg, was painted in 1840 by Jean Francois Millet and due to Noah Butkin's generosity enters the Museum as its first portrait by this important Barbizon painter. Constant Troyon is usually known for his landscapes with cows or sheep, but he could also paint fine portraits such as the one of a boy glancing alertly over his shoulder. These are only a sampling of the Butkin paintings which so greatly enrich our collection. In addition to these splendid paintings, a smaller, but nevertheless significant group of sculpture came as part of the Noah L. Butkin bequest, including works by such nineteenth century French masters as James Pradier, Jean-Baptiste Clesinger, and Jean Baptiste Carpeaux. A related work, a fine terra cotta by Jean-Jacques Feuchere, was given in his Memory by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Kashey and Martin L. H. Reymert. A sculpture of great aesthetic distinction, but difficult to place in time and space, is the recently acquired Saint Sebastian in painted and gilded wood. Included a few years ago in an exhibition of the art of the Ticino, an Italianate Canton of Switzerland, it is clearly the product of a region where north ern and southern traditions intermingled. David d'Angers was the most distinguished French por traitist in sculpture in the first half of the nineteenth century. He had the typically romantic ambition to portray all of the most famous men and women of history. In 1829 he made a medallion relief of the composer Rossini and the next year a bust of him. The Museum has recently acquired a marble, dated 1831, which is presumably the bust which David d'Angers is recorded as having presented to his sitter, the composer whose opera William Tell had just been received with great acclaim in Paris. During the past year several notable, but quite various, acquisitions were made in the field of silver. A simple, almost austere, English Communion Cup of 1671 is a particularly distinguished and well-preserved example of a form common since the late sixteenth century. Quite different is a small silver-gilt Ewer, with restrained but exquisite neoclassic orna ment, which was part of a large service bought by Count Nicolas Demidoff from the famous Parisian craftsman, Jean Baptiste-Claude Odiot, in 1817. Several decades later, his son, Charles-Nicolas Odiot, supplied to Louis Philippe, King of -v--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~j~ ||,l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ii;;...'~P':(W--~?is ~;~~:: rallery s iew of merican Realism ad the Industrial</page><page sequence="10">France, the Centerpiece, which comes to the Museum among the many works in the Butkin bequest. Quite extraordinary is a Tea Set made in France in the early twentieth century after the designs of the Italian architect Carlo Bugatti. Each of its vessels is in the form of an imaginary animal, with small ivory tusks serving as finials. This tea set, which was purchased for the Thomas L. Fawick Memorial Collection, is one of the most exceptional extant examples of the Art Nouveau style. Other notable acquisitions for the year included: a Nymph enburg porcelain Pipe Head of the mid-eighteenth century, modeled by Franz Anton Bustelli; a fine Tiffany glass Vase in the so-called paperweight technique, a welcome gift of Audrey Calvert Caunter; a group of twentieth-century decorative arts, among them an especially fine bronze Hand Mirror designed by Rene Lalique, which was the gift of Louise Rorimer Dushkin; and Dominick Labino's Faceted Fountain of 1978 a glass sculpture presented by Mr. and Mrs. James A. Saks. The paintings collection was enhanced by the acquisition of the Still Life with Sweets by Juan van der Hamen y Leon, a rare and beautiful example of the concentrated realism and mystical flavor of early Spanish seventeenth-century still-life painting. The Baroque gallery was enriched with a small can vas by Sebastiano Ricci believed to be a bozzetto for one of the pendentives in the Ossuary Chapel of San Bernardino, repre senting an Apotheosis of a Saint. Accessions representing the eighteenth century include an early sensitive Self-Portrait in pastel by Anton Raphael Mengs, the first example by this German artist in the Museum collection, and a signed still life of Kitchen Utensils with Leeks, Onion, and Eggs of ca. 1734 by Chardin, giving us an excellent early example of a series of this type before the artist changed to a lighter palette as re vealed in the Museum's own Still Life with Herrings of some years later. Among 1980 purchases was a landscape by Theodore Caruelle d'Aligny of Nymphs Bathing in a Forest Pool, painted about 1860 in cool colors with somewhat broad and simplified trees, giving a rather modem look to an antique subject, similar to the spirit of Puvis de Chavannes. Another d'Aligny of a quite different subject, a Landscape with Medieval Castle atop a rocky hill, came to the collection through the Butkin bequest. Also purchased was View on the Coast of Capri, a small oil of the imposing headland below the palace of Tiberius, by Jean-Achille Benouville, painted in delicate half-tones which produce a subtle effect of atmosphere. A small, beautifully executed 1851 version of a quintessentially romantic subject by Ary Scheffer inspired by Canto V of Dante's Divine Comedy was bought by the Museum. The shades of slain lovers, Paolo Malatesta and Francesca de Rimini, appear to Virgil and Dante in the circle of Hell reserved for carnal sinners. A splendid 1980 gift was the likeness of an alert Boston octogenarian, Mrs. Anna Dummer Powell, painted in 1764 by the leading American colonial portraitist, John Singleton Copley. This family portrait was given in memory of a Powell descendant, Mabel Cabot Sedgwick, by Ellery Sedgwick, Jr. The collection of pre-Columbian art was enriched by several attractive gifts. From Mr. and Mrs. H. S. Weiner came a Maya terra-cotta Rattle in the Form of a Female Figure. Mrs. Theodate Johnson Severns gave an anthropomorphic gold Pendant from Colombia in the Tolima style, a variety pre viously unrepresented in our collection. A Stirrup Jar with Monkey and Three Fruits, made somewhere along the north coast of Peru late in pre-Columbian times, was presented by Rabbi and Mrs. Daniel Jeremy Silver. The single addition to the North American Indian collection was a late nineteenth century Sioux Pipe Bag made from trade canvas and decor ated in a geometric pattern with dyed quill work. The manuscript for the Museum's Catalogue of European Paintings, 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries was completed. The renewed interest in the more academic aspects of nineteenth-century art produced several exhibitions to which loans were made. Augustus Saint-Gauden's Diana of the Tower and William Morris Hunt's Winged Fortune were lent to The American Renaissance: 1876-1917, organized by the Brooklyn Museum and shown in Brooklyn, San Francisco, and Denver. Four French sculptures and one painting, Ary Scheffer's Princesse Marie d'Orleans, formed part of the ex hibition The Romantics to Rodin, shown first in Los Angeles and later in Minneapolis, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Boston. Among forty-two pictures from our collection of American and European paintings loaned to other Museums during the year were Aved's Portrait of M. Jean-Gabriel de la Porte du Theil to the Staatliche Museen in Berlin for their exhibition Images of Man in Western Art, celebrating their 150th an niversary. While Cleveland's Twilight in the Wilderness by Frederick E. Church and pictures by William Bradford and William Stanley Haseltine were on loan to the National Gallery in Washington for American Light: The Luminist Movement 1850-1875, we had the pleasure of Winslow Homer's Breezing Up in the gallery of later nineteenth-century art. The Museum also loaned six other American pictures to five special exhibitions organized elsewhere, among them J. Alden Weir's Building a Dam at Shetucket to Storrs, Connecti cut, for Connecticut and American Impressionism. Twenty five American nineteenth-century paintings were loaned to the Beck Center of Cleveland, and our Audubon Duck Hawks to the Beachwood Museum. The Museum's French Volunteer was seen in Springfield and Williamstown, Massachusetts, as well as in Detroit, in the exhibition, Enrollment of the Volun teers: Thomas Couture and the Painting of History. 231</page><page sequence="11">Visitors to the Department included A. L. den Blaauwen (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), Gillian Wilson (J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu), Pierre Ennes (the Louvre), Frank Trapp (Director of the Mead Art Museum Amherst College), and Hal Opperman (University of Washington). In March the Chief Curator, Henry Hawley delivered a talk at the Mid-West Art Historical Conference in Columbus, Ohio. He visited museums and private collections in northern Italy and Switzerland in June. The furniture of Latz and Oeben was the subject of his lecture at the annual meeting of the Antiquarian Society at the Art Institute of Chicago in November. In October and early December he visited dealers in New York, and in the latter month he was in Paris and London viewing works of art and doing research. In August Mr. Hawley assumed the duties of editor of The Decorative Arts Society Newsletter. The Curator of Paintings, Ann T. Lurie attended a two-day seminar on the Art of the Age of Carlos II, King of Spain (1759-1788), at the Spanish Institute in New York in April. During 1980 the Associate Curator of Paintings, William S. Talbot attended the Allston symposium in Boston and a museum administration seminar in Washington. He delivered a paper on conservation and curatorship at the annual meeting of the American Association of Museums in Boston and at tended the annual meeting of the Ohio Museums Association. He supervised the Cleveland showing of Thomas Moran: Watercolors of the American West, an exhibition organized by Carol C. Clark of the Amon Carter Museum, based upon her dissertation directed by Mr. Talbot in the Art Museum Studies Program. In May the Assistant Curator, Virginia Crawford, traveled to Washington to study North American Indian artifacts at the Smithsonian Institution. PRINTS AND DRAWINGS The year began impressively with the acquisition of a large and dramatic drawing, The Funeral of Decius Mus, by Jean Honore Fragonard after a painting by Rubens. Dutch draw ings-for many years a strong area of the Museum collection -were enhanced by the addition of Aelbert Cuyp's Landscape with a Windmill near a Farmstead, Abraham Bloemaert's A Barnyard with Goats and a Goatherd, and Allart van Ever dingen's A Rocky Cove with Fishing Boats. The seventeenth century in Flanders is now represented by Sebastien Vrancx's allegorical drawing, Proverb on Death. At year's end, the quality of acquisitions was upheld by the purchase of a small and rare sixteenth-century Italian drawing possibly by Dosso Dossi. Rembrandt's etching Sheet of Studies was a major addition to the Museum's growing number of fine Rembrandt prints, representing a type of print, indicated by its title, of which we had only one other example. Two sixteenth-century German prints, Albrecht Diirer's The Virgin with the Swaddled Child and Hans Baldung's The Body of Christ Lifted by Angels, augment a particularly important area of the collection. Until this year, the Museum lacked a print by the English artist George Stubbs. This shortcoming was corrected bya rich impression of A Sleeping Leopard. In addition, the Museum purchased seven more drawings and thirteen prints. The deeply appreciated generosity of donors once again contributed a major part to this year's accessions. The Print Club of Cleveland gave its 1980 Presentation Print, T.L. No. VI by Jack Tworkov. Seven members of the Print Club contributed individual gifts. Mr. and Mrs. Robert Shearer gave a mezzotint by Sir Frank Short and an etching and soft ground etching by Ferdinand Schmutzer, the latter in memory of Janet L. Mack. From Mr. and Mrs. Henry Steinberg we received Andy Warhol's offset lithograph Liz Taylor, in memory of Katherine C. White, and Roy Lichtenstein's litho graph, Shipboard Girl, in memory of Anne Steinberg Heil brunn. A set of twelve etchings by Samuel Prout, in memory of Print Club member Margery Irish, and a lithograph by Eugene Delacroix, The Wild Horse, were the gifts of Mr. and Mrs. Wilbur D. Prescott. The generous bequest of Noah L. Butkin enriched the drawing collection with two works by Leon Bonvin, one by Francois Bonvin, and one by Felix Bracquemond. A drawing by Louis Auguste Mathieu Legrand, The Serenade, was a gift in memory of Mr. Butkin. Untitled #5, a paperwork by Laurence Barker, was given in memory of Janet L. Mack. Mrs. Paul B. Travis donated two etchings by Wilhelm Leibl, Head of a Peasant and Head of a Peasant Woman, in memory of her artist husband. Three counterproofs of lithographs by William Sommer were the gift of Clayton J. Bachtel in memory of Bruce Bachtel. The drawing of the Funeral Mountains by Mel Pekarsky entered the collection as a gift in memory of Moselle Taylor Meals. Arnold Klein gave a mezzotint by Sir Frank Short in memory of Robert Reese Larsen. The drawing Outer Staircase of a Gothic Ruin by the German artist Domenico Quaglio was added in honor of Leona E. Prasse to our growing collection of German drawings. The Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Prasse Collection was augmented by five engravings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, eight studies by Richard Parkes Bonington, and a drawing by Gaetano Gandolfi. The modem part of the collection received significant addi tions besides the Warhol and Lichtenstein mentioned above. Barbara and Larry Robinson contributed four etchings by 232</page><page sequence="12">Donald Judd, Mr. and Mrs. William E. Ward a screen print by the Japanese artist Noriyuki Nakamura, Mr. and Mrs. Robert I. Broida a Sol Le Witt lithograph, and Jerome Flum the portfolio of five prints, Ruins and Landscapes, by Philip Pearlstein. With the exceptions of Lichtenstein and Pearlstein, these gifts mark the first time each of the artists is represented in the print collection, as does the anonymous gift of a litho graph Self Portrait by Raphael Soyer. Twenty-seven prints, seven drawings, and two monotypes were prepared and loaned to exhibitions in this country, Canada, Europe, and Japan. Two monotypes were lent to The Painterly Print, shown at the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and three prints to Printmaking in the Age of Rembrandt at Boston and St. Louis. The exhibition of works by Camille Pissarro held at the Hayward Gallery in London, the Grand Palais in Paris, and also at Boston included one print from this Museum. Two Cleveland drawings were included in The Realist Tradi tion exhibition, which originated here. One drawing and four prints were sent to two separate exhibitions in Tokyo. Among visitors welcomed by the Department were Bogo mila Welsh-Ovcharov (University of Toronto and Art Gal lery of Ontario), Jacquelynn Baas Slee (University of Mich igan), John Hand (National Gallery of Art, Washington), Arlette Serullaz (the Louvre), Innis H. Shoemaker and Katherine Lee Keefe (William Hayes Ackland Art Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), David Brown (The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), Agnes Mongan; Ken neth McConkey (New-Castle-on-Tyne), Charles Helsell (The University Gallery, University of Minnesota), Timothy Riggs (Worcester Art Museum), Heidi Gealt (Indiana University Art Museum), Christian von Heusinger (Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig), Ronald Pickvance (Uni versity of Glasgow). Both the Chief Curator, Louise S. Richards, and Assistant Curator, Anne I. Lockhart, visited galleries in New York and attended the meeting of the Print Council of America in New Haven. Miss Richards was a delegate at the New York meet ing of the International Advisory Committee of Keepers of Public Collections of Graphic Art, marking the first time that the Museum was represented on the Committee. Ms. Lockhart was present at the Annual Meeting of the College Art Associa tion in New Orleans. Karen W. Smith traveled to Paris and London on a Kress Foundation Dissertation Research Grant. For further training in her work as Preparator, Kim S. Clift spent time at the Intermuseum Conservation Laboratory in Oberlin. In late November and early December, Paper Con servator Keiko Keyes made her annual visit to continue work on the conservation and preservation of the collection. Louise S. Richards became Chief Curator of Prints and Drawings this year. Karen W. Smith replaced Josephine Poda as Secretary in early January. In September, Hilliard T. Goldfarb joined the staff as Assistant Curator (part-time), the recipient of a five-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Gallery view of The 1980 May Show</page><page sequence="13">Foundation to the Museum and Case Western Reserve Uni versity where he is an Assistant Professor (part-time). Dr. Goldfarb graduated summa cum laude from Bowdoin Col lege with a degree in philosophy and religion. He holds M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in art history and has been assistant to the curator of drawings at the Fogg Art Museum. He has lived and studied in Europe where he assisted with the catalog of the exhibition of drawings by Titian at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, in 1979. He is co-author of European Master Drawings of Six Centuries from the Collection of the Fogg Art Museum (Tokyo, 1979). MODERN ART Among gifts welcomed by the Department during the year is a most impressive group of photographs including forty-five prints by Clarence H. White along with some by his students (three by Ema Spencer and one by Julia McCune), dating from 1896 to 1915; these were most generously given by Elizabeth Flory Kelly, John Flory, and Phoebe Flory. In addition, Minor White's Golden Gate Bridge came from Nicholas C. Hlobeczy and Martin Linsey's The Texan from the artist. These were also gratefully received and add new notes to our growing collection of photographs. Gifts of paintings which were accepted with appreciation include Reclining Nude, by Lennart Anderson, from The National Academy of Design, New York, and Stereography, a construction by Vivien Abrams, from Joseph M. Erdelac. Of special note are eleven paintings and four sculptures which came to the Department from the estate of the ever generous Noah Butkin who had been a Trustee of the Museum and an avid collector. The artists represented in this fine group of works are the painters Jacques-Emile Blanche, Leon Bonnat, Eugene Carriere, Paul Camille Guigou, Jean Baptiste-Armand Guillaumin, Leon-Augustin Lhermitte, Henri Alexandre Georges Regnault, Germain Theodore Ribot, Jacques Joseph Tissot, and Jean Georges Vibert; sculptors included are Louis-Ernest Barrias, Vincenzo Gemito, Paul Paulin, and Denys Pierre Puech. Purchases include a major Synthetic Cubist canvas, The Coffee Mill (Le Moulin a Cafe), dated 1916, by the Spanish artist Juan Gris, our first painting by this artist; a fine abstrac tion by Jackson Pollock, Number 5, 1950, which fills a gap in our collection of American Abstract Expressionist painting; Dancing Sailors by Charles Demuth, a figure composition which joins three important flower compositions by this im portant American water colorist; a small and elegant papier collh by a young American artist, Ellen Stavitsky; and a unique iron sculpture, Pensive Face, by another great Spanish artist and friend of Picasso, Julio Gonzalez. Five important photographs: Columbus Circle by Berenice Abbott; Rue du Regard by Eugene Atget; Stonehenge by Paul Caponigro; Mondrian's Studio by Andre Kertesz; and Homage to Edward Hopper (purchased from the artist) by Willard Traub, also add significantly to the photograph collection. Nineteen works were loaned by the Department to fourteen exhibitions at other institutions. Two went to London, one to Paris, one to Liege, Belgium, one to West Berlin, and six went to the Pablo Picasso exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Forty-six works made up the exhibition The Cleveland Museum of Art Collects Cleveland Art, held at the Frank J. Lausche State Office Building, in celebration of Cleveland Art Week. Thirty-four long-term loans to other Cleveland institutions were extended, and seven works were returned from the American Embassy in Vienna where they had been on long term loan. Ten works were lent to the Modem Art Department of The Cleveland Museum of Art on a long-term basis, and forty nine other loans were extended. Included are major works by Henri de Fantin-Latour, Camille Pissarro, Paul Gauguin, Milton Avery, Jean Dubuffet, Robert Motherwell (from the artist), Arakawa, Adja Yunkers, Edouard Vuillard, and Maurice de Vlaminck. In addition to the ever popular May Show, the Modern Department mounted three exhibitions: Cleveland Collects Modem Art, The Cleveland Museum of Art Collects Cleve land Art (at the Frank J. Lausche State Office Building), and Paintings by Abel (Buck) Warshawsky. Distinguished visitors to the Department included: Robert Buck (Albright-Knox Gallery of Art, Buffalo, New York), Roland Penrose (London, England), Isamu Noguchi (New York and Japan), Gyorgy Kepes (M.I.T., Boston), George Rickey (New York), Deborah Remington (New York), and Fernand Vellozo (Museum of Contemporary Art, Brazil). The Chief Curator, Edward B. Henning, lectured at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and traveled to New York several times to visit galleries and museums and to act as an advisor for a film on Surrealism. He also traveled to Miami, where he served as an expert witness in a tax case involving modem paintings. In the fall he visited galleries, museums, and monuments in London, Cologne, Basel, Zurich, Dijon, Vence, Avignon, and various other cities in Western Europe. He and the Associate Curator, Tom Hinson, also visited galleries and studios in this region, served on committees, and as advisors and trustees of a number of local art organizations. Mr. Henning continued to organize the Museum's film program (see report under Department of Art History and Education). Mr. Hinson served on the jury for the Three Rivers Art Festival in Pittsburgh, the Toledo Area Artists 62nd Annual 234</page><page sequence="14">Exhibition, and the Michigan Artists 80/81, organized by the Detroit Institute of Arts and held in Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. Besides carrying out assignments in Europe, he visited museums, galleries, and studios in New York, Phila delphia, Pittsburgh, and Detroit. TEXTILES AND ISLAMIC ART The single but highly significant acquisition made in the Islamic area was a large, white bronze salver from Afghan istan, dating from the Ghaznavid Period (twelfth century). Engraved with a courtly scene in the center and with an animated Kufic inscription around the rim, the salver is one of very few surviving examples of Ghaznavid metalwork. The only other comparable piece in a museum collection is a bowl in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The earliest of the textiles acquired during the past year is a fragmentary hanging from sixth-century Egypt. It is clearly related in technique, color, and style to a series of tapestry panels belonging to a school of weavers associated with the city of Antinoe. A gift from Mr. and Mrs. William Robertson was a welcomed addition to the Museum's important group of fourteenth-century Italian silks. Also significant for the collection was the addition of three Indonesian textiles: two hinggi, or mantles, with bold designs of animal, plant, and patola motifs from the island of Sumba, and a pua, or hang ing, from Borneo. All three are ikat dyed and date from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. Several embroideries from sixteenth-century Italy and seventeenth-eighteenth-century England were loaned to the exhibition, The Art of the Needle, sponsored by Pennsylvania State University. A stimulating program presented by The Textile Arts Club included a series of lectures and workshops on techniques of weaving, photo imagery on fabric, quilting, and basketry. Rhoda Levinsohn of Cleveland also lectured on The Decora tive Arts of Southern Africa. The high point of the year was Microfibers, a juried exhibition of miniature work in fiber that was sponsored by The Textile Arts Club. Held at the Beck Center for the Cultural Arts from October 22 to November 16, it featured entries (no larger than 9 inches in any direction) submitted by artists living within a radius of 250 miles of Cleveland. In April and May the club held its annual juried exhibition of members' work at the Museum. In the conservation division of the Department, Hermine Altmann implemented a new storage method for over 1,200 pieces of lace and supervised the washing, blocking, and re pairing of many of the pieces. In addition, the large Swiss embroidery, The Holy Kinship, was repaired and mounted as were a number of important medieval textiles from Egypt, Iran, and Italy. In the spring, Jane Teasley joined the depart ment as a trainee in textile conservation. One of the textile storage rooms was completely remodeled, resulting in con siderable expansion of our over-crowded storage facilities. The Chief Curator, Dorothy G. Shepherd, attended the Byzantine Studies Conference in Oberlin and chaired a ses sion of the fourteenth Annual Middle Eastern Studies Assoc iation Meeting held in Washington, in conjunction with the Conference of Islamic Art Historians of North America. Traveling abroad, she went to Spain and then to London where she attended a colloquy, Between China and Iran: A Group of Paintings in Four Albums in Istanbul, sponsored by the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art. In addition, Miss Shepherd supervised the reorganization of the Museum's Islamic galleries and, with the Assistant Curator, Anne Wardwell, prepared for final editing the first volume of the medieval textile catalog. ORIENTAL ART Major efforts of the Department were devoted to the exhibi tion Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting which was organized jointly with the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum, Kansas City. Comprising more than 300 works from the two collec tions, this is the largest and most comprehensive exhibition of Chinese painting ever seen in this country. The exhibition opened in Kansas City on November 6 and would later travel to Cleveland, New York, and Tokyo. A fully illustrated catalog written by Wai-kam Ho, Sherman E. Lee, Laurence Sickman, Marc Wilson, and others documents and interprets the ex hibition. In conjunction with Eight Dynasties a special work shop on Chinese painting, organized by the University of Kansas and sponsored by The American Council of Learned Societies, was held in Kansas City. Mr. Ho chaired the session on Court Patronage and Dr. Lee was co-chairman of the panel on Collecting Chinese Painting in America. Some of the most interesting acquisitions in Chinese art in 1980 include three bronze sculptures, all in modest sizes. The powerfully cast chimera of the Six Dynasties (ca. third-fourth centuries) is one of the most elegant examples known of Chinese animal art. The deeply cut, sharp facial characteriza tion of an ascetic holding a skull is a veteran from the great 1935-1936 exhibition at Burlington House. It is Northern Wei style at its most striking and original, reflecting the best Yun-kang tradition (i.e., caves 18, 33) for representations of Hindu figures and arhats. Originally the caparisoned elephant was the vehicle of a now missing image of Samantabhadra. While labeled in the auction catalog as a Ming piece, it is un doubtedly a rare example of the tenth- to eleventh-century Buddhist art of the Khitan people. Almost equally rare in 235</page><page sequence="15">ceramic is a Chi-chou pottery mei-p'ing of the Southern Sung Dynasty (thirteenth century) with stylized waves vigorously and freely painted in dark brown over a tan colored slip. Although pieces with similar wave design have been found in the Nan-ch'ang area, this by comparison is the largest and the most complete example of its type. A gap in the ceramic col lection was filled by another fine piece from the same auction -a ch'ing-pai cup and stand beautifully potted in the shape of a petalled flower blooming in stylized pale-blue elegance. The painting collection has continued to grow during the joint exhibition. Some new accessions, such as the Ch'ing-pien Mountain, the celebrated masterpiece of Tung Ch'i-ch'ang and one of the great monuments in Ming painting, are dis cussed in the Eight Dynasties catalog. Among the others which came too late to be included in that exhibition is an important hand scroll of the Southern Sung, illustrating the Odes of Pin. Probably painted by a painter of the Academy, the scroll is not only one of the earliest examples for this ex clusive didactic subject derived from the Confucian classics, but a fresh and unaffected interpretation of the poem which unfortunately eventually became stereotyped as a result of being monopolized by court painters. Japanese accessions are headed by a group of Edo Period (1615-1868) paintings acquired this year. Among these Watanabe Kazan's (1793-1841) Portrait of Ozora Buzaemon must be considered the most significant. It offers a poignant, life-size (over 7 feet) study of the samurai and would-be sumo wrestler, a pathetic giant of nineteenth-century Japan. Kazan, a student of Tani Buncho (1763-1840), is noted for his por trait-sketches (such as this example) done in a Western influenced manner. Buncho was an establishment figure, an art historian, and a renowned painting teacher, capable of mastering diverse brush techniques. The set of Four Views of West Lake illustrates a keen and subtle understanding of Ming (1368-1644) painting styles then popular in Japan among connoisseurs and collectors. Gion Nankai's (1677-1755) Landscape also reveals an in terest in Chinese painting, but at the beginning of this im portant development. A noted calligrapher and painter of bamboo from the Kansai (Kyoto-Osaka-Nara) area, Nankai's influence on late literati artists was considerable. One of these, Matsumura Goshun (1752-1811) painted in a number of styles during his lifetime. The small screen Traveling to Shu depicts a traditional Chinese theme on an unusual back ground, half gold and silver. The result is one of the most striking combinations of decorative and literati styles, but one in harmony with Japanese taste. "Tea-taste" is exemplified by the Iron Kettle with crane designs, a vessel used for heating water in the preparation of tea. The tea ceremony served as an artistic "event" of crucial importance in Japan, and the various utensils used on a particular occasion were selected with the water container and kettle serving as focal points. Consequently this acquisi tion is a major addition to an already distinguished, if small group of tea ceremony objects in the collection. The Indian and Southeast Asian collection was enriched by the addition of an attractive Gandharan bracket with two figures of musicians. This architectural fragment, quite West ern in appearance, brings to mind certain medieval European cathedrals, although it probably comes from the area of Butkara in the Swat Valley. The opposite southern corer of India is represented by a Chola bronze depicting the monkey-god, Hanuman. This popular hero of the Ramayana epic, helped Rama recover the abducted Sita from the hands of the demon Ravana. Hanu man is not often represented in Chola bronzes since his own cult evolved much later. Thus, the bronze-along with the famous Tanjore Hanuman in India, representations in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and in a private collection in this country-is one of only a few known. A significant addition in the field of Indian painting is the Kishangarh miniature, representing the high point of that style, the reign of Maharaja Swant Singh (ca. 1750). It is the only example of the desirable Kishangarh School in the collection. The Himalayan area is represented by the acquisition of an important early Nepalese stone sculpture of Vishnu. Its style closely relates to that of the Changu Narayan temple, ca. eighth century, and represents the earliest Licchavi style of Nepalese sculpture. The Javanese collection was enriched by two purchases and an important gift. Each of these represents a different media. The purchases are a bronze Varahi dating to the ninth century, displaying unusually dynamic movement, and a Majapahit Dynasty (fourteenth century) terra-cotta piggy bank. The latter, playful and humorous in treatment, is intact. This is a rare phenomenon, since piggy banks filled with coins were usually broken then in the same way they are today. Finally, the generous gift of Dr. Norman Zaworski provides the col lection with a handsome example of stone sculpture depicting a sensuous and graceful celestial being representing classical tenth-eleventh-century Prambanan style. Loans for exhibitions held elsewhere included four hanging scrolls to Tokyo National Museum for the exhibition, Art of the Tea Ceremony; and six Chinese jades to the Lowe Art Museum, University of Miami, for Jade, East and West. Six Japanese objects were loaned to the Museum of Albuquerque for a Japanese Art Exhibition; and eight Tz'u-chou ware ceramics were sent for four showings of Freedom of Clay and Brush through Seven Centuries in Northern China: T'zu-chou Type Wares, 960-1100 AD at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, China House Gallery (New York), and the Denver Art Museum, as well as at Cleveland. 236</page><page sequence="16">ik Gallery v-iew of 5,000 Years of Korean Art. I r I '3 F-llery view of 5,000 Years of Korean Art Gallery view of 5,000 Years of Korean Art Among the many foreign visitors were Bunsaku Kurata (Nara National Museum), Shigemi Komatsu (Tokyo National Museum), and Chai Zemin (Ambassador from the People's Republic of China). In addition, the 5,000 Years of Korean Art exhibition brought accompanying curators as well as special visitors including Sunu Choi (National Museum of Korea), Yong Shik Kim (Ambassador of Korea), and Byong sam Han (Kyongju National Museum). The Chief Curator, Sherman Lee, attended meetings of the Association of Art Museum Directors, the American Associa tion of Museums, the Gallery Committee of the Japan Society (New York), the Indemnity Panel of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities, The American Arts Alliance, the Trustees of The Asia Society, the Trustees of the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, and the Museums committee of CULCON, the Japan-American Friendship Association. He gave lectures at the Atlanta Historical Society, the Indian apolis Museum of Art, and the Nelson Gallery (Kansas City), and a Convocation address at the University of Notre Dame on the occasion of the opening of the new art museum there. In July he was guest in Germany with other museum directors at the 150th Anniversary of the founding of the museums of Berlin. Dr. Lee and the Curator of Chinese art, Wai-kam Ho, were among the invited speakers at the First International Con ference on Sinology sponsored by the Academia Sinica in Taipei in early August. They jointly presented a paper on Liang Ch'ing-piao, the great seventeenth-century collector and his collection. The Adjunct Associate Curator of Japanese art, Michael Cunningham, traveled to the Art of the Tea Ceremony exhibi tion at the Tokyo National Museum for study and research, to the Maruyama Okyo-Shijo School exhibition in St. Louis, and to the Denver Art Museum for the installation of Master works of Japanese Buddhist Paintings from Western Collec tions. He also delivered two lectures on Japanese prints at the Sunrise Museum, Charleston, West Virginia. The Curator of Indian and Southeast Asian Art, Stanislaw Czuma, delivered a lecture on Hindu Art at Oberlin College. 237</page><page sequence="17">THE JUNIOR COUNCIL The Council assists the professional Museum staff by manning the Information Desk, supervising the operation of First Thursday when curators examine works of art belonging to the public, publicizing Museum events, and promoting mem bership. Every other week a member records an announce ment of a current exhibition, activity, or membership benefit for broadcast on WCLV-FM during the Saturday night program featuring a recorded Museum concert. Council members con tinue to assist in the East Cleveland Project and during 1980 helped at the Sales Desk. The 1980 Lecture Series New Perspectives on Korean Art featured three speakers on: the archaeology of early Korean states, classic Korean ceramics, and the influence of China on Korea and of Korea on Japan. The series was held May 20, 21, and 22, attracting nearly 700 persons. We were happy to assist in the housing and entertainment of couriers and guest lecturers on the occasion of the opening of and symposium on The Realist Tradition in November. We helped the Museum with receptions at five Members' Previews of exhibitions last year as well as assisting with sales at both previews of the May Show, hosting post-concert receptions, and aiding Musical Arts subscription ticket sales. The Council contributed books to the Library, flowers to the North Lobby and the Garden Court, and made a gift to ward the purchase of works of art. As a group we widened our familiarity with other museums by visiting the Henry Francis Dupont Winterthur Museum at Winterthur, museums in Akron, and the Picasso exhibition in New York City. We endeavored to increase the support for arts funding in Ohio through the Ohio Citizens' Committee for the Arts. We have 300 members, some of whom are among the originators of the Council and many of whom are active on eighteen committees. Present members propose new members with experience or interest in the Museum collection or pro grams and who are willing to volunteer their time and energy over a ten-year period. We contributed over 2,000 hours in 1980. Our Executive Committee met once each month to plan programs and activities for the monthly membership meetings which usually featured a talk by a Museum staff member. We added fifteen new members to help at the Information Desk and three new honorary members associated with the Museum staff. As my two-year term as Chairman comes to a close I would like to thank the very helpful Museum staff and the tireless members of the Council for their support. MRS. DAVID T. MORGENTHALER GENERAL MANAGER In 1980 this office arranged the previews for the exhibitions The Year In Review, The May Show, 5,000 Years of Korean Art, Old Master Paintings from The Collection of Baron Thyssen-Boremisza, and The Realist Tradition: French Painting and Drawing 1830-1900. Substantial grants were received from the National Endow ment for the Arts for the exhibitions Chardin 1699-1799, The Spirit of Surrealism (both held in 1979) and Old Master Paintings from The Collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza, and for conservation of works of art on paper. The National Endowment for the Humanities also made a grant for The Realist Tradition: French Painting and Drawing 1830-1900. A grant was also received from The Ohio Program in the Humanities for The Draftsman's Eye: Late Italian Renais sance Schools and Styles (held in 1979). The College Library Resources Program of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare provided funds for the purchase of books for the Library. Again the Ohio Arts Council granted funds for operations. September saw the beginning of the joint appointment with Case Western Reserve University of two persons to serve as assistant professors-assistant curators in Ancient Art and Prints and Drawings, generously funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The Japan Foundation continued its support of the joint appointment of the assistant professor *associate curator of Japanese Art. In November the Museum served as co-host for a public meeting of the Crafts Planning Task Force of the National Endowment for the Arts. It also provided a reception, launch ing the publication of Abel Warshawsky's autobiography, The Memories of an American Impressionist, by the Kent State University Press. The General Manager continued to serve as Vice President for Ohio of The Midwest Museums Council, as a board mem ber of the Ohio Museums Association, and as chairman of The Northeastern Ohio Inter-Museum Council. The post of General Manager was created mid-1970. The opportunity to share in the administration of this great Mu seum and to participate in its programs provided challenges and substantial rewards. In concluding this final report, I wish to express my appreciation to the Director and Trustees for the confidence placed in me, to colleagues and the Junior Council for their support, and to my secretary, Kathryn Curtis, for her loyal and devoted service. After more than forty years as an arts administrator in Ohio, I can approach retirement with a host of memories and a sense of fulfillment. A. BEVERLY BARKSDALE 238</page><page sequence="18">ART HISTORY AND EDUCATION The total number of participants in all aspects of our educa tional program decreased from 128,871 in 1979 (a corrected figure) to 127,943 in 1980. The decrease in general program attendance must reflect the rise in fuel costs and the general state of the economy, while an increase in other attendance figures may reflect a public interest in low-cost programs. Several special programs were initiated, and the didactic exhibitions contributed to the understanding of the visual arts in Greater Cleveland. Young People's Programs Self-guided and staff-conducted classes during 1980 included 54,606 young people-an increase of 3.93 percent from 1979. Since the Cleveland school year was extended in 1980 due to teachers' strikes, their students could not attend summer programs resulting in a 14.7 percent decrease in attendance. The city school system's financial problems also resulted in a 20.3 percent decrease in attendance in the regular Museum classes for young people. The East Cleveland Project continued in its eleventh year under support from federal grants. In the fall of 1980 Susan Kaesgen became a full-time staff member and assumed re sponsibility for it. Cleveland Public Schools have continued to send one class per day for a Museum tour. These tours, conducted by Museum staff members, in addition to the University Circle project, make a substantial program with the Cleveland Public Schools. Children's Saturday Classes took advantage of the special exhibitions: 5,000 Years of Korean Art; Korea: Bridge of Culture; and The Realist Tradition: French Painting and Drawing 1830-1900. Special classes were designed to ac company these shows: Oriental Treasures; People, Places, and Things; and The Peasant or The Cube. High School Programs Ronnie Zakon taught the second semester of the Advanced Placement Program in Art History to fifty area students. Thirty-nine of these took the national Advanced Placement examination in May, and 75 percent received advanced credit. Katherine Solender took over teaching this course in the fall. The Martha Holden Jennings Foundation grant for Advanced Placement scholarship aid ended with the 1979-1980 school year, and the Department then assumed responsibility for the scholarship. For the fifth year, the Arts of China and Japan course was offered by Marjorie Williams. Twenty-seven area high school students took the eight-week course in the fall, and thirteen students from Beaumont School earned partial credit for it. In January one student from Beaumont School did an independent project under the supervision of Ellen Breitman. In May Ronnie Zakon supervised seven area high school seniors working on independent projects. The majority of them involved observing departmental activities and doing research on Museum objects.

Cunningham Another of the degree candidates in the Art Museum Studies Program completed the requirements for her Ph.D. degree. Carol C. Clark finished her work on the artist Thomas Moran. Continuing Education In 1980 twenty-four courses were offered to adults; total attendance was 4,126. The Museum, for the seventh consecutive year, offered a series of cultural and social events for the public on four Wednesday evenings in July. Large and appreciative audiences enjoyed the Wednesday Evening Summer Festival series. Four, well-attended lectures were offered in support of the 5,000 Years of Korean Art exhibition. As a model for departmental involvement in connection with a special exhibition, no better example can be used than the following one related to the Realist Tradition exhibition: 1. Mini-Courses Beginning three weeks before the exhibition opened, a series of four lectures to familiarize the general public with the ex hibition was scheduled at twelve public locations and for five private groups throughout the metropolitan area. Each lec ture, including the fourth which was given in the exhibition gallery, was purposely planned as a separate entity in case not everyone could attend all four. There was no fee involved, but advance registration was requested by the Museum. 2. Films on Art and Artists A series of films about the art and artists of 1830-1900 was shown during the run of the exhibition. 239</page><page sequence="19">3. Complementary Exhibition American Realism and the Industrial Age and The Drawings and Water Colors of Leon Bonvin accompanied the primary exhibition. See the exhibitions listing elsewhere in this Bulletin. 4. Special Lectures A series of free, guest lectures dealing with issues suggested by the content of the exhibition was offered. 5. Publications One major catalog for The Realist Tradition plus smaller ones related to the complementary exhibitions were published. An exhibition guide, entitled "Notes on the Exhibition," was written by Helen O. Borowitz and distributed to the public, free of charge. A grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities supported its publication. 6. Symposium The European Realist Tradition in the Nineteenth Century was an educational examination of the development of the Realist-Naturalist movement. Coordinated by Mark M. Johnson under Gabriel Weisberg's supervision, the three-day symposium (November 15-17) involved a series of presenta tions by twelve scholars, augmented by panel discussions. It drew an attendance of 2,886 individuals. 7. Other Slide-tape programs were prepared and shown; daily gallery talks were scheduled in the exhibition area during the first week of the show; and guided tours were available to school groups or they could come in on a self-guided basis. Printed flyers announcing the various events were prepared and dis tributed throughout the community; all events were free and open to the public. Packets of slides, the "Notes on the Exhibition" guide, and other educational materials relating to the exhibition were distributed to area schools. Programsfor the Handicapped Gallery talks on the first Tuesday of each month, at 1:30 pm, with an interpreter for the hearing impaired became a regular offering by the Department in January. Mark Johnson, who oversees this program, presented talks which surveyed the Museum collection. Other instructors covered exhibitions and specialized topics. In 1980 few requests from the visually handicapped were made. One Cuyahoga Community College student who is both blind and deaf requested a general tour of Western art to supplement his class work. Barbara Kathman and the student's own interpreter assisted him in increasing his under standing of art history. Subsequent discussion with his pro fessor led to further information on how the Museum could help handicapped individuals. In conformance with federal guidelines, the Museum desig nated James A. Birch as its 504 coordinator. Educational Exhibitions Six thematic exhibitions were organized by members of the Department: Science within Art by Lynette Rhodes; Idea to Image: Preparatory Studies from the Renaissance to Impres sionism by Mark Johnson; Korea: Bridge of Culture by Marjorie Williams and Joellen DeOreo; Japanese Woodblock Prints: Themes and Techniques by Marjorie Williams and Mark Johnson; The Drawings and Water Colors of Leon Bonvin by Gabriel P. Weisberg; and American Realism and the Industrial Age by Marianne Doezema. Details appear in the Exhibitions listing in this Bulletin. Education Publications Adele Z. Silver moved to the Museum's Public Relations Department as Assistant Manager and Editor. The Themes in Art series of publications was turned over to the Publica tions Department. Films, Public Lectures, and Audio-Visual Programs Edward B. Henning, Curator of Modem Art, again organized the adult film program. A film series, begun the previous fall incorporating aspects of the Surrealist spirit, was completed in the spring. It included eight films by directors such as Rene Clair, Luis Bufiuel, and Marty Feldman. The summer series was devoted to nine American films from the 1930s. The Thin Man, Ninotchka, and Dinner at Eight were representative of the best Hollywood products of the period. In the fall, a series entitled Realism in the Film served to complement the exhibition, The Realist Tradition. The special categories used in the exhibition-such as rural and urban labor, domestic life, war, and natural disasters-were also used in selecting the films. They illustrated many kinds of realism, from the lyrical documentary-such as Georges Rouquier's Farrebique and Robert Flaherty's Man of Aran to the harsh naturalism of Carlos Saura's The Hunt and the introspective reality of Robert Bresson's Diary of a Country Priest. Thirty-one guest lectures were given throughout the year, twelve as part of the three-day Realist Tradition symposium. Non-symposium lecturers included Anthony Addison, Wayne E. Begley, Pramod Chandra, Carol C. Clark, Tony Cohn Barter, Petra Chu, Beatrice de Andia, Laurinda Dixon, Erica Cruikshank Dodd, Marvin Eisenberg, Thomas W. Gaehtgens, B. N. Goswamy, Anne Clark James, Kenneth McConkey, Donald Posner, Philippe Verdier, Gillian Wilson, and William D. Wixom. The following lectures were given as part of the symposium: Petra T. D. Chu, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Memory Drawing; Francoise Forster-Hahn, Aspects of 240</page><page sequence="20">German Nineteenth-Century Realism; Theodore Zeldin, Social Themes in Realism; Gabriel P. Weisberg, The Petits Maitres as Masters of Realism; Theodore Reff, The Laundress in French Art from Philipon to Picasso; Albert Boime, Pour ing New Realist Wine from Old Academic Bottles; Robert L. Herbert, Courbet and Millet; Linda Nochlin, Later Realism and the Documentary Impulse: Illustrators, Photographers, Painters; Genevieve Lacambre, Toward a Clearer Definition of Naturalism in French Nineteenth-Century Painting; Hans Liithy, World and Country Aspects of Realism in Switzerland; H. W. Janson, Realism in Sculpture: Limits and Limitations; Ronald Pickvance, Degas's L'Absinthe. In addition to the guest lecturers, Dr. Lee spoke twice on Korean art and Gabriel P. Weisberg once on The Realist Tradition exhibition and again on the Drawings and Water Colors of Leon Bonvin. Ann T. Lurie gave three lectures on various aspects of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza's collection against the background of the Museum's own master paintings. Fourteen new audio-visual programs were completed or initiated during the year by Fred Janesch with textual content approved by Helen Borowitz and Gabriel Weisberg. These included: The Realist Tradition by Helen 0. Borowitz; American Realism and the Industrial Age by Marianne Doe zema; Conservation and Restoring Mummy Cases by Jay Hoffman; Idea to Image: Drawings into Paintings and The Collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza (prepared for use only with the exhibition) by Mark Johnson; The Year in Review by John Moore; Baron Vitta and The Rodin Hand Mirror, Theodule Ribot, and Bonvin by Gabriel P. Weisberg; and 5,000 Years of Korean Art and Korea: Bridge of Culture by Marjorie Williams. Slide tapes and video presentations were begun for the Chinese paintings show. Slide-tape presentations for use with traveling exhibitions were prepared and existing slide-tapes were reprogrammed and improved. Tapes were made for airing on WCLV-FM an nouncing coming events at the Museum. Extensions Division Exhibitions prepared by the Extensions Division appeared at various sites in the community during the year. The Kenneth C. Beck Center for the Cultural Arts received Graphics of the American Scene, Surrealism in Perspective, and American Paintings 1825-1915; Karamu House had Japanese Hand crafts, Wood Sculpture, Glass, and Japanese Woodblock Prints; and the Ashtabula Arts Center featured Arts of Japan. Special exhibits were prepared for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Women's City Club. Science within Art, first seen at The Cleveland Museum of Art, later traveled to the Beachwood Museum. Prints from the New Deal Graphics Projects was seen at the Willoughby School of Fine Arts and the Geauga Campus of Kent State University. Portable modular units were utilized in various areas: New Realism and Super Realism traveled to Solon, Twinsburg, and Maple Heights Regional libraries to display contemporary prints; The Realist Tradition: French Painting and Drawing 1830-1900 is traveling extensively; Cleveland Heights, Euclid, and Lorain County Community College libraries received a display on bronzes. An additional modular unit was built to service the Brecksville School System and Margaret Wagner House of the Benjamin Rose Institute. Robert Eskridge and Ann Boger joined the staff as full-time members. The Extensions collection was enriched by the addition of fifty objects, either by gift or purchase. A detailed list appears at the end of this report. As an added responsibility, the Extensions Division ac cepted a summer intern. John J. Taormina worked at the Museum from May 13 to August 13 on a project dealing with the organization and development of an exhibition of twen tieth-century lithographs. The theme of the show, to be cir culated among the outreach galleries in the community, was the relationship between lithographic processes and the re sulting image. He also observed as much Museum activity as possible: attending gallery talks, using library and print study room sources, and visiting various storage areas and laboratories. During 1980, the major focus of Gabriel P. Weisberg's attention was The Realist Tradition exhibition which opened on November 12. As organizer of the exhibition which cul minated five years of research on the subject, he completed the preparations for the accompanying catalog and oversaw many of the details for the exhibition itself as well as the accompanying special programs outlined above. In addition he maintained a busy schedule of writing articles for various publications in connection with the exhibition, giving guest lectures, and supervising the ongoing activities of the Department. In January of 1980 Michael G. Lawrence resigned his position as staff instructor; Susan M. Kaesgen joined the staff as full-time instructor in the fall. Ronnie Zakon resigned in August to assume the post of Director of Education of the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design.

MUSICAL ARTS In 1980 the Department of Musical Arts sponsored seven Gala Subscription Series concerts and eight performances in the Summer Series. The Musart Society presented twelve con certs in The Musart Series and gave the Museum a new forte piano-built by Philip Belt of Pawcatuck, Connecticut, after an instrument by Anton Walter, once owned by Mozart. The fortepiano was dedicated in a weekend of lectures and a con cert, featuring the builder and Malcolm Bilson, a foremost American fortepianist. Visiting organists from the United States and abroad in cluded Herndon Spillman, Daniel Hathaway, Wolfgang Riibsam, and Antonio Baciero (who also played the piano in the second of four recitals of early Spanish keyboard music presented in northeastern Ohio). Vytautas Smetona, William Bolcom, and Nicolas Constantinidis performed as solo pian ists. Harpsichordists Lucille Gruber, Preethi de Silva, Karyl Louwenaar, and Ray Ferguson were heard in solo perfor mances. Singers Joan Morris, William Parker, and Seth McCoy presented voice recitals. Chamber music was played by the Toulouse Chamber Orchestra, the Alban Berg Quartet, the Portsmouth Chamber Ensemble, the Freiburg Baroque Soloists, the Boston Musica Viva, the Boehm Quintette, the Erdely Duo, the Prague String Quartet, and violoncellists Zara Nelsova and Roger Drinkall, as well as a number of local musicians. Other individuals and ensembles included Masayuki Koga playing the shakuhachi, the Ohio Boychoir, the Trinity Cathedral Choir, tubist Michael Lind, the Blossom Festival Vocal Chamber Ensemble, Sam Finger and the Dixie Dandies, the Footpath Dance Company, actor Richard Curnock, and musicologist Frederick Neumann. The Curator played twenty-seven recitals and made a recording on the McMyler Memorial Organ in Gartner Auditorium. His performances outside the Museum included a concert tour of Japan, during which he dedicated a new instrument. He also premiered Cleveland composer Donald Erb's new work Nebbiolina, commissioned by the Museum's Walter Blodgett Memorial Fund, at the national convention of the American Guild of Organists in Minneapolis. Bruce Shewitz was promoted to Assistant Curator. He played several impromptu organ recitals and instituted gallery talks about the organ. 242</page><page sequence="22">LIBRARY Books cataloged 3,436 titles in 4,138 volumes Gifts 1,854 titles Exchange 2,337 titles Volume count 12/31/80 105,289 Outside readers registered 4,356 Book circulation 27,883 Interlibrary loans processed 503 Serials: subscription and membership 612 titles exchange 849 titles Volumes bound 906 Last year-the first complete year the Library used the com puter-based Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) to catalog its book and serial acquisitions-was full and varied. In this cooperative cataloging endeavor which in volves some of the major university and art museum libraries in this country as well as the Library of Congress, it is a sig nificant measure of the Museum's activities and of the effi ciency of its Library staff that nearly six in every ten titles added by the Museum to the RLIN database were unique at the time they were cataloged in Cleveland. Such originiality adds richness to a national bibliographic resource and makes the Museum's cataloging available to others as it in turn utilizes others' cataloging information. The Librarian and other mem bers of the professional staff met with their counterparts from the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Research Libraries Group to continue implemen tation of common cataloging standards. The Library's RLIN activities were funded by the second year of a three-year award from the A. W. Mellon Foundation. In July and August the entire card catalog (compiled over 65 years, with an estimated 600,000 cards) was refiled with simplified filing rules. Minor editing and error detection were incorporated in the process, and the catalog was expanded after refiling. A partial stack inventory was done at the same time. In the fall the Associate Librarian, Judy Frost, held in formation sessions about RLIN for Museum staff, and the Serials librarian, Bonnie Postlethwaite, received additional training at RLIN headquarters, Stanford University. Work essentially was completed on architectural working drawings for new space for the Library's three departments. Although installation of compact book storage stacks in the Oriental Study Room relieved overcrowding in that area, the Library's main stack reached capacity in 1980. Book storage problems began to affect library services adversely. Services will continue to deteriorate until additional space is available. For the second year we note the generous gift of important back runs of serials from the Cleveland Public Library. Donors to the Library are included in the composite list else where in this Bulletin. Library circulation manager Al Habenstein keeps more than 100,000 volumes in order.</page><page sequence="23">Members of the professional staff attended meetings of the College of Art Association and the Art Libraries Society in New Orleans and the Special Libraries Association in Washington. The Library hosted the fall meeting of the Ohio chapter of the Art Libraries Society. Roberta Young was appointed Assistant in the Catalog Department, as was Hilde Klingler. Cherie Bauer and Janice Fleischner resigned, and Hana Groszspitz was appointed Assistant to the Librarian. SLIDE LIBRARY Slides accessioned 21,023 Gift and exchange 1,736 Slides cataloged 11,521 Slide count 12/31/80 251,287 Circulation: Public 34,175 CMA Staff 13,059 Two of the Museum's major special exhibitions, The Realist Tradition and Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting, dominated activity in the Slide Library in 1980. To support the Chinese exhibition and symposium, 6,124 slides (more than 50 percent of the total cataloged for the year) were added, while a smaller number provided material for the education programs and seminars surrounding The Realist Tradition. Slide use by CWRU faculty in the Museum's joint program in art history increased by 40 percent over 1979, accounting for just under half the total circulation. The Slide Librarian, Sara Jane Pearman, served as chairman of ARLIS/Ohio, conducted a session on living artist archives for the Midwest Art History Society, and spoke on the theory of slide cataloging at the Mid-America College Art Associa tion meetings in Houston. PHOTOGRAPH LIBRARY Photographs purchased 2,282 Gift and exchange 2,467 Photograph count 12/31/80 85,144 Circulation 1,723 Photograph Library use increased markedly in 1980. Sub stantial additions were made to the special collections, par ticularly in microfiche format. Of special interest are the illustrations to Christie's sales catalogs, totaling more than 70,000 images of items sold by the London auctioneers since early in this century. Stanley W. Hess, Associate Librarian for Slides and Photo graphs, resigned to become Librarian of the Nelson Gallery Atkins Museum, Kansas City. LouCinda Holt, inadvertently omitted in the report for 1979, completed her second year as photograph cataloger. PUBLIC RELATIONS AND MEMBERSHIP Two major exhibitions organized by the Museum and two important traveling exhibitions were at the center of the Public Relations Office's work in 1980. The Realist Tradition: French Painting and Drawing 1830-1900 and its attendant activities involved the Public Relations staff throughout the year, resulting in the greatest amount of coverage in the local, national, and international media for an exhibition at the Museum since The European Vision of America exhibition in 1976. Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting: The Collections of the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum, Kansas City, and The Cleveland Museum of Art was an exhibition which did not open in Cleveland during 1980 but nevertheless required much effort on the part of the Public Relations Office. The Manager, David Patterson, worked closely with the Kansas City staff in preparing materials for the show and presenting it to the national media. Two major traveling exhibitions were shown at the Museum in the summer and fall: 5,000 Years of Korean Art and Old Master Paintings from the Collection of Baron Thyssen Bornemisza. They both received a great deal of local coverage and were well received. The Realist Tradition, Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting, 5,000 Years of Korean Art, and Paintings from the Collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza along with the May Show received the most attention in the local media and were the most popular of the year. Attendance at the Museum for 1980 was 461,564. A total of 107 press releases and public service announce ments covering exhibitions, activities, acquisitions, and other events went to the press and electronic media during the year. Publications carrying articles on the Museum or its activities included Newsweek, Los Angeles Times, Art Journal, Bolaf fiarte, Financial Times of London, Realities, Museum Maga zine, Connoisseur, Connaissance des Arts, and 19th Century. A total of 1,470 new members joined the Museum in 1980. The annual Holiday Gift Membership offer brought in 110 new members. Cancellations in 1980 totaled 1,229, leaving a net gain in membership of 241. Total active membership at year end was 9,285. One new Individual Endowment Fund was established: David H. Jacobs. The amount added to Endowment Funds and Contributing Endowment Funds totaled $64,493.43, and $25,225 was added to the Life and Fellow classifications. Annual, Sustaining, and Corporate membership contribu tions totaled $136,005, a decrease of $8,646.50 from the 1971 total. Responsibility for publishing the News &amp; Calendar was transferred to this Department with Adele Z. Silver, formerly of the Art History and Education Department, as editor. In the membership office Margaret Winiski retired. 244</page><page sequence="24">Mr. Patterson traveled to New York twice to promote Museum exhibitions. In addition he went to Chicago and Kansas City to confer on exhibitions. He also attended a development conference in Minneapolis and lectured in Indianapolis. The Assistant Manager, Ann Edwards, attended a membership conference in Denver. Denver. REGISTRAR The Museum collection is always active. During the year it contracts and expands with loans, gifts, and purchases. All changes and transfers of objects are tracked by the Registrar's office. In 1980 3,427 objects entered the Museum. These objects were received as possible gifts or purchases, for study, exami nation, conservation, photography, or as loans to special exhibitions. Of that a total of 344 objects were accessioned into the collection: 186 as gifts and 158 as purchases. The 1,094 objects received as loans were for the special exhibitions held during the year. More than half of these loans were borrowed for the year's three major exhibitions: The May Show, 227 objects; 5,000 Years of Korean Art, 349 objects; and The Realist Tradition, 251 objects. Five hundred and ninety works were received for study, examination, con servation, and photography. Condition reports are prepared for every work of art as it enters the Museum and is insured on the Museum's Fine Arts Insurance policy. When the object arrives at the Museum, it is unpacked by the art handlers in the presence of someone from this Department. If the work was accompanied by a courier because of its extremely fragile or valuable nature, the courier is also present at the unpacking. The condition report is prepared at that time and compared to a report made prior to shipment. For the foreign incoming loans for The Realist Tradition exhibition the Registrar traveled to London and Paris to prepare the condition reports for U. S. Government Indemnity insurance before the pictures were packed. The Registrar, Delbert Gutridge, also accompanied the loans from Great Britain to Cleveland. There were 3,171 objects in outgoing shipments checked by the Department during 1980, each requiring condition reports, insurance, and supervision for packing. Loans from the Museum collection going to other institutions for special exhibitions accounted for 464 of these objects. They were lent to 44 galleries and museums: 449 in the United States and Canada and 15 to other foreign countries. One of last year's largest shipments contained the 159 Chinese paintings which were sent to Kansas City for the Eight Dynasties of Chinese Paintings exhibition. They were divided into three separate shipments which were courier accompanied. Other loans went to Florence, Italy; London, England; The Museum of Modem Art, New York; The St. Louis Art Museum; and the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto. For all shipments, incoming and outgoing, the Registrar works with the Museum's insurance broker to see that in surance is properly placed. During the year, the shipping schedule must be closely watched to see that each risk is studied and reported monthly to the insurance company. The 87 import and 47 export shipments take special handling, with each one scheduled through the Museum's customhouse broker, freight handler, and U. S. Customs. After an Accession Meeting, the cataloger assigns an acces sion number to accepted gifts and purchases and prepares the initial draft of a catalog card. The draft is sent to the appro priate curator who completes the data on the card and returns it to the Registrar's Department for final typing. Four cards are typed for each object accessioned. In 1980 over 2,000 cards were typed. In addition to the objects accessioned during the year, cards were prepared for many objects which had been changed or reclassified by the curator as a result of further study. Photographs of objects in the collection, loans, and works sent for examination are taken by the Museum photographer and prints are filed in our office. Over 900 photographs had to be cataloged and filed during the year. This file is kept current for consultation by students and visitors who use them to purchase prints for their research. These orders are also handled by the Department. In May the processing of all orders and requests for per mission to reproduce works from the Museum collection in various publications, including films, was turned over to the Department from the various curatorial offices. This involves checking each request with the available photograph or trans parency, placing an order with the Photo Studio, and invoic ing the purchaser, all of which must be done promptly. Visitors included Mr. Ching She, Registrar, Palace Mu seum, Taiwan, and Ms. Katherine Gates, Registrar, Portland Museum of Art. Frances A. Fleming retired in December after thirteen years of illustrious service. The good wishes of the staff go with her. In November Jacquie Casey joined the Department. This report would not be complete without giving due credit to all the members of the Department for their efficiency and loyalty throughout the year. 245</page><page sequence="25">CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT The Painting Conservators extended a major effort in the preparation and installation of the Old Master Paintings from the Collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza and The Realist Tradition exhibitions. In the Thyssen collection, all 57 paint ings were examined, and 10 were given minor treatment. Over 250 works of art were examined for the Realist show: 122 received minor treatment, 5 received major treatment, and 7 were given technical studies including.infrared and ultraviolet photography and x-radiography. Major treatment, which began in 1979, was completed on the Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Horatius Codes Defending Rome Against the Etruscans (CMA 49.571). Other paintings that received major treatment in 1980 included: Anonymous Florentine, Madonna, Child and Angels, CMA 16.791 Chardin, Still Life with Copper Pot, CMA 80.37 Henri Fantin-Latour, Red, White and Yellow Roses, CMA 79.137 Lanzani, Death of the Virgin, CMA 16.797 Bernardino Luini, Madonna and Child, CMA 16.812 Mengs, Self-Portrait, CMA 80.38 Maurice Prendergast, On the Beach, CMA 1653.26 J. S. Rousseau, Rogers Room Panels, CMA 42.4, 42.5 and 42.7 Peter Paul Rubens, Triumph of the Holy Sacrament Over Ignorance and Blindness, CMA 16.1037 Vlaminck, Paysage au la Barque, CMA 82.73 In addition to the above major treatments, 68 paintings were examined for accession or loan, and 35 were given minor treatment. The Preparators glazed and carried out minor frame res toration on 21 paintings in the Thyssen exhibition and ap proximately 50 works of art in The Realist Tradition, in addi tion to 150 paintings in the Museum collection. X-radiography and technical photography were completed on 130 paintings, while 165 paintings were unframed for photography. Over 150 works of art were rematted, 48 of them for the Eight Dynasties exhibition. The Preparators also supplied the Ex tensions Division and Prints and Drawings Department with plexiglass as needed. A total of 169 works of art were treated in the Department's Objects Laboratory, as follows: Ancient Art, 33; Early Western Art, 18; Later Western Art, 51; Modern Art, 15; Oriental Art, 40; Textiles and Islamic Art, 4; and Art History and Education, 8. The following objects of special interest were treated: Bronze Luristan Horse Bit, CMA 80.102 Polychromed Wood Corpus, CMA 80.1 The Reliquary of the True Cross, CMA 52.84 Wooden Italian Lectern with Pope Clements XI Coat-of-Arms, CMA 15.572 Gilt Bronze Ascetic Holding a Skull, CMA 80.25 Wooden Standing Kuan Yin, CMA 80.80 Bronze Chimera, CMA 80.184 The Objects Conservators also aided in the installation of the exhibitions: 5,000 Years of Korean Art and The May Show. During the fall, Keiko Keyes spent a month at the Museum as Resident Paper Conservator treating approximately 300 Japanese prints and examining a variety of Western prints and drawings. Earlier in the year, she treated three works of art at her studio in San Francisco. Three prints and drawings from the Museum collection were treated at the Intermuseum Con servation Laboratory, Oberlin, by Paper Conservator, Tim Vitale. Outside analytical studies were made on eleven works of art by Herron Testing Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio; Beta Analytic, Inc., in Coral Gables; and Walter C. McCrone Assoc., Inc., in Chicago. Along with routine examinations and treatments, Karen Crenshaw and Zahira Veliz, Mellon Fellows in Painting Con servation, conducted research projects which will result in publications. Ms. Crenshaw recently completed an investiga tion of George Inness' painting technique as related to his style. She also spent a month in England visiting conservation studios and museums. Ms. Veliz traveled through America and Europe examining and studying the painting technique of Francisco de Zurbaran. In addition to lending practical assistance in the Department, the Mellon Fellows have con tributed ideas and enthusiasm. During the year, the following Seminars and Conferences were attended: at the Intermuseum Conservation Laboratory in Oberlin, The History of Frames (Christman, Crenshaw, Rivera, and Veliz), Conservation and the Curator (Pre parators), Conservation Procedures for 20th-Century Works of Art (Crenshaw and Veliz), and The Mechanical Behavior of Paintings on Fabric (staff); the American Institute of Con servation Annual Meeting in San Francisco (staff except Veliz); the Wooden Objects Symposium in Ottawa (Christ man); and a symposium on The Conservation of Contem porary Art in Ottawa (Crenshaw). The Conservation staff presented tours and lectures to a wide variety of visiting groups. Ross Merrill presented lectures regarding conservation procedures to the Optical Society in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and to the Northeast Museums' Group at the Carnegie-Mellon Institute of Research. He also presented a lecture on Painting Techniques: The Flemish Tradition in Spain and Chardin, the Non-Conformist, at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Karen Crenshaw lec tured to the Courtauld Institute and the Hamilton Kerr Institute in Great Britain on the use of interleaf materials in 246</page><page sequence="26">the lining of paintings. Zahira Veliz served as a panelist in a Women in Science Symposium at Notre Dame College. Frederick Hollendonner traveled to Greece to oversee the packing of the exhibition, In Search of Alexander, sponsored by the National Gallery of Art. Beverly Goldbeck joined the Department as Administrative Assistant replacing Elizabeth Bailey, who left to enroll in a graduate program at Case Western Reserve University. BUILDING AND GROUNDS Aside from the carpentry and masonry work required to partition the Public Relations area into three separate office units, repairs and replacements accounted for the greater portion of the Department's work in 1980. Plumbing repairs were required in the kitchen, cafeteria, and 1916 building, and in the air conditioning unit in Gartner Auditorium. Closed circuit Tv cameras were replaced in Gal leries 13 and 14, as was the aerofin coil for the library fan room, west galleries. Grilles at the North Entrance and in the lower education area were repaired; damaged stucco panels on the Breuer building were removed and repaired; joints in granite panels of the outer garden court were re-caulked; a sewage pump was replaced; the lower parking lot platform and steps were reconstructed; and broken sidewalk along the north side of the building was replaced. New installations included lighting and thermostats in the greenhouse, a security alarm at the roof hatch, pyro-alarm detectors in the roof above the ceiling of the Gartner Auditor ium, new cushions for marble benches in the north foyer of the Breuer building, cut curbing for wheelchairs in the visitors' parking lot, and a marble rosette at the south entrance of the original building. The copper water lines were completed in the lower parking lot. Many varieties of floral and foliage plants were displayed in seasonal arrays at the North Entrance and the inner and outer garden courts. Three large trees from the west side of the building were moved to different locations. The Department received 2,272 requests for service.

REPORT OF ERNST &amp; WHINNEY, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS Board of Trustees The Cleveland Museum of Art Cleveland, Ohio We have examined the balance sheets of the Operating and Capital Funds of The Cleveland Museum of Art as of December 31, 1980, and the related statements of income and unexpended income and capital fund principal for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and, accordingly, included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. In the absence of established generally accepted accounting principles for this type of organization, the Museum carries no value in its financial records for land, buildings, equipment, and art objects owned through purchase or contribution, and no determination has been made of the aggregate carrying values of such assets. Income from investments is recorded on a cash basis. The Museum's accounting policies are further described in Note A. These practices differ in some respects from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in con formity with generally accepted accounting principles. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly the financial position of the funds of The Cleveland Museum of Art at December 31, 1980, and the results of its operations and changes in fund balances for the year then ended, on the basis referred to in the preceding paragraph, which basis has been consistently applied.
