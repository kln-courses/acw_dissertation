<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT HERRICK: THE ENGLISH HORACE (Concluded from page i8i) There are certain recurrent themes in Herrick's poetry whose treatment shows particular Horatian influence. These appear in his poems on poetry itself, poems on a type of man who may be called the Stoic hero, Epicurean verses, poems on a simple life in the country. Herrick's poems on poetry are To his Booke, on his Pillar of Fame and to his readers. One of the most striking, To his Booke', is very like in spirit to Horace Epp. I.20. In each case the book is personified as a wanton girl who has lost her modesty on publication, who longs for publicity, and who now is resigned to her fate by the poet. In another poem', Herrick fears for his book the fate of beinig used as wrapping paper by the grocers, just as Horace in Epp. 2.I at the end fears lest he be bornc to the street which deals out incense and perfumes and pepper and everything that is wrapped in worthless manuscripts. Quotations from Horace's Ars Poetica occur in three passages. Herrick's To the generous Reader reflects several lines of the Ars Poetica-on the need of overlookinig small faults3 and on the fact that Homer CVCLe iS known to nod4. See, and not see; and if thou chance t'espie Some aberrations in my Poetry, Wink at small faults, the greater, ne'rthelesse Hide, and with them, their Father's nakedness. Let's do our best, our Watch and Ward to keep: Homer himself, in a long work, may sleep5. A couplet entitled Parcell-gil't-Poetry again quotes the Ars Poetica: Let's strive to be the best; the Gods, we know it, Pillars and men, hate an indifferent poet6. Also a poem on Master Fletchers Incomparable Playes describes their value in Horace's own terms: O Volume worthy, leafe by leafe, and cover, To be with juice of Cedar wash't all*over'. Lastly, Herrick's Pillar of Fame begins with Hor- ace's words for his own monumentum: Fames pillar here at last, we set, Out-during Marble, Brasse, or Jet8. Herrick's poems on what I have called the Stoic hero have no such pagan titles; yet his Christian Mil- itant is that Horatian type "prepar'd against all ills to come" and "made up all of rocke and oake". Jt is the same hero who appears in Herrick's Desired. Give me a man that is not dull, When all the world with rifts is full: But unamaz'd dares clearely sing, Whenas the roof's a 'tottering: And, though it falls, continues still Tickling the Citterne with his quill9. The fourth line of this verse seems to echo Horace C. 3.3, while another short poem called Purposes is almost a translation of the same Ode: No wrath of Men, or rage of Seas Can shake a just man's purposes: No threats of Tyrants, or the grim Visage of them can alter him; But what he doth at first entend, That he holds firmly to the end'. Herrick's Good Precepts or Counsel bestowed upoIn this hero quotes three lines from Horace: In all thy need, be thou possest Still with a well-prepared brest: Nor let the shackles make thee sad; Thou canst but have what others had. And this for comfort thou must know, Times that are ill won't still be so. Clouds will not ever poure down raine; A sullen day will clere again. First, peales of Thunder we must heare, Then Lutes and Harpes shall stroke the eare 1 3.8. 2 2.290. 8 Epp. 2.3.35I-352. 4 Epn. 2.3.359. 5 I.-3. 6 3.46; Epp. 2.3.372-373- 3.ii0; Epp. 2.3.331-332. 8 3.88* C. 3.30. 9 3,50. 10 2.i88. 11 2.242.</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY For the Horatian lines see C. 2.IO.14-15, 17; 2.9.1-2. Herrick shows the same mixture that Horace does of Stoic and Epicurean feeling, for side by side with these verses on the Stoic hero stand Epicurean poems on the old themes of Wein, Weib, und Gesang. In three of these poems, Horace himself is celebrated by name, in each case in company with Anacreon. The longest of these, A Lyrick to Mirth, is Herrick's Epicureanism at its fullest. While the milder Fates consent, Let's enjoy our merriment: Drink, and dance, and pipe, and play; Kisse our Dollies night and day: Crown'd with clusters of the Vine; Let us sit and quaff our wine. Call on Bacchus; chaunt his praise; Shake the thyrse and bite the Bayes: Rouze Anacreon from the dead; And return him drunk to bed. Sing o're Horace; for ere long Death will come and mar the song"2. In an Ode to Sir Clipsebie Crew, describing his own life in very Epicurean terms, Herrick speaks first of honoring the verse of Anacreon, and adds: Then cause we Horace to be read, Which sung or seyd, A goblet to the brim Of Lyrick Wine, both swell'd and crown'd, A Round We quaffe to him13. Again in his Farewell to Sack, Herrick tells his favorite drink: Horace, Anacreon both had lost their fame, Hadst thou not fill'd them with thy fire and flame"4. At another time, his drink is the "Cecubum" which Hlorace celebrated'. In a poem lamenting the un- happiness of his country at the time of the common- wealth, he says he is "dull" and "lost to all Musick now" and longs to get back his joys and his power of lyric poetry: I should delight to have my Curles halfe drown'd In Tyrian Dewes, and Head with Roses crown'd. And once more yet (ere I am laid out dead) Knock at a star with my exalted head'6. The spirit of the four lines as well as the exact words of the last line are Horace's. Herrick's poems on a simple life in the country are full of the spirit of Horace as well as of quota- tions from him. Grosart has pointed out that the long poem called A country-life: to his Brother, M. Tho. Herrick" is "on Horatian wings"; indeed in general style and thought it is not unlike some of Horace's Epistles. It contains also several phrase- imitations of Horace. The first line, Thrice and above bless'd, my soul's half art thou, contains two phrases from Horace. Felices ter et ampliu.r", and Animae dimidium meae'9. "Those who have the itch of craving more, are never rich" paraphrases Multa petentibus desunt multa'. Faunus who in the Vision comes to keep, From rav'ning wolves, the fleecie sheep is the very god of Horace's farm celebrated in C. 3.I8 and C. 1.I7. The "Holy-meale and spirting salt" are the farre pio et saliente mica of C. 3.23.20. "Un- taught to suffer Poverty" is direct translation of in- docilis pauperiem pati and A heart thrice wall'd with Oke, and Brasse, that man Had, first durst plow the Ocean is a translation of C. I.3.9-12. But one must read the whole poem to catch the Horatian tone. 'So again in A Thanksgiving to God for his House, Herrick is close to Horace's own feeling for the simple life on the Sabine farm and at the end echoes a phrase from Serm. 2.6.3-4, Horace's own gratitude to the gods, in All these and better thou dost send. In the same spirit is this quatrain which takes its last line from Horace: Happy's that man, to whom God gives A stock of Goods, whereby he lives Neer to the wishes of his heart; No man is blest in every part21. Herrick uses Horace's key-note phrase for the sim- ple life, contentus parvo, in two poems, in Who with a little cannot be content Endures an everlasting punishment'. and again in this: To Bread and Water none is poore; And having these, what need of more? Though much from out the Cess be spent, Nature with little be content2e. A warning against the dangers of high estate copies Horace's warning illustration to Licinius: Lastly, be mindfull (when thou art grown great) That Towrs high rear'd dread the lightnings threat Whenas the humble Cottages not feare The cleaving bolt of Jove the Thunderer'. The conclusion of the whole matter for Herrick and for Horace together is: Who with a little cannot be content. Endures an everlasting punishments. Besides these groups of poems on poetry, the Stoic hero, Epicurean pleasure, a simple country life, Her- rick contains many scattered allusions to Horace which can hardly be classified. He uses Danae in her tower three times as an illustration as Horace used her2'. He hopes that he may not throw away his shield upon the field of battle, having in mind surely Horace's humorous rhipsaspis'. Then he is full of moral sayings taken from Horace's poems. Vertue conceal'd (with Horace you'l confess) Differs not much from drowsie slothfullnesse&gt;. Although our suffering meet with no reliefe, An equall mind is the best sauce for griefe29. Men must have bounds how farre to walk; for we Are made farre worse, by lawless liberty'4. 12 I.67. 132 i6o-i6I. 14 I.77. 15 2.178. 16 2.I88; C.

Sin leads the way, but as it goes, it feels The following plague still treading on its heels'. I might quote many more Enough material has been given to show Herrick's kinship with Horace and the inherent paganism of the English poet. But most of the material used has been taken from the Hesperides and account must be taken of His Noble Numbers, or his Pious Pieces, published in I647. All the natural gaiety, irresponsi- bility, and joyousness which laughs through so much of Herrick's verse is here gone; indeed so different seems the clergyman writer from the Horatian poet that a case of dual personality almost appears be- fore us. Happy pagan and solemn priest stand out sharply contrasted in the introductory pieces to the two books. However, although the conventional language of the Church fills the great majority of these Pious Pieces, the real Herrick of the Hesperides now and then shows his smiling face. The most charming and tender humor appears in two poems to the Christ Child. An Ode of the Birth of our Saviour regrets that the child was born in a stable instead of in all luxury. Even lighter and more unconventional is an- other poem-To his Saviour, a Child, a Present, by a Child: Go prettie child, and beare this Flower Unto thy little Saviour; And tell Him, by that Bud now blown, He is the Rose of Sharon known: When thou hast said so, stick it there Upon His Bibb, or- Stomacher: And tell Him-(for good handsell too), That thou hast brought a Whistle new, Made of a clean strait oaten reed, To charme His cries (at time of need) Tell Him, for Corall thou hast none; But if thou hadst, He sho'd have one; But poore thou art, and knowne to be Even as monilesse as He. Lastly, if thou canst win a kisse From those mellifluous lips of His; Then never take a second on, To spoile the first impression'. The baby Christ is here as real and childish as one of Corregio's lovable little angels, and the spirit of approach is surely pagan in the anthropomorphic rep- resentation of deity. Compare Horace's lines on the small Mercury and his roguishness'. I have already spoken of the secular poem on a simple life in the country, A thanksgiving to God, for his House, which appears in Noble Numbers'. It is a homely genre picture of the "Little house, whose humble Roof is weather-proof". And in it the Lord is thanked for "Worts, the Purslain, and the Messe of water-cress", and it is the Lord who is told 'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering Hearth With guiltlesse mirth; And giv'st me wassail Bowles to drink Spic'd to the brink. And again Thou mak'st my teeming Hen to lay Her egg each day. Most genial and happy is the tone of such recognition of the Lord's blessings, but surely very different from the usual conventional tone of the Pious Pieces. A familiarity with God which I cannot help but call Pagan is manifested here, as again in a prayer where Herrick begs his Lord to come to him always in friendly and happy aspect. Come to me God; but do not come To me, as to the gen'rall Doome, In power; or come Thou in that state, When Thou Thy Lawes didst promulgate, Whenas the Mountain quak'd for dread, And sullen clouds bound up his head. No, lay thy stately terrours by, To talke with me familiarly; For if Thy thunder-claps I heare, I shall lesse swoone, than die for feare. Speake Thou of love and I'le reply By way of Epithalamie, Or sing of mercy, and I'le suit To it my Violl and my Lute: Thus let Thy lips but love distill, Then come my God, and hap what will"7. Another poem in the same friendly tone is To God, His good will. Gold I have none, but I present my need, O Thou, that crown'st the will, where wants the deed. Where Rams are wanting, or large Bullocks thighs, There a noor Lamb's a plenteous sacrifice. Take then his Vowes, who, if he had it, would Devote to Thee, both incense, myrrhe, and gold, Unon an Altar rear'd by Him, and crown'd Both with the Rubie, Pearle, and Diamond&gt;-. In this, not only is the spirit like that of Horace's Ode to the country woman, Phidyle, in which he assures her that if the hand that touches the altar is pure, it is not more acceptable when it brings rich victim'3, but also the line A poor Lamb's a plenteous sacrifice echoes Horace C. 2.I7.32, Nos humilem feriemus agnam. So that even in his religious pieces Herrick has something in common with Horace, and in them shows something of the gay and familiar at- titude towards the gods that was possible to the old pagan world. It is this familiar Herrick of the cheerful heart who seems to me so truly Horatian. For that subtle thing, literary kinship, is a matter of temperament in the last analysis, however much correspondences in times, education and facts of life may seem to pre- pare the way for it. So the English bachelor who was attracted by many maidens, but not supremely by any one, who delighted in flowers, animals, festi- vals and all the simple joys of the country, in spite of protestations of its dullness, who loved the city S' 2.263; Epp. I.6.48. a2 3.I56; C. 3.2.32. 88 Cf. 3.3! and Epp. 2.2.176 * z.io and Epp. T.I8.
