<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON BOOKS. The third edition of Kolle and v. Wassermann's handbook of micro-organisms8 is appearing seriatim. We mentioned the publication of previous fasciculi in our issues of May 7th, 1927 (p. 839), February 11th, 1928 (p. 223), and October 27th, 1928 (p. 751). Seven further fasciculi have reached us?namely, Part 29 of vol. i, in which the subjects of allergy, anaphylaxis, and the relation of colloids to the immunization process are reviewed ; Parts 23 and 24 of vol. iii, dealing with serological, chemotherapeutical, and epidemiological topics ; Part 25 of vol. v, which is largely concerned with leprosy ; Parts 27 and 28 of vol. vi, containing numerous articles on bacteriological and worm infections ; and Part 26 of vol. ix, which is devoted to certain veterinary and botanical diseases. The high standard of the previous volumes is well maintained. 8 Handbuch der pathog'enen Mikroorganismen. Begr?ndet von W. Kolle I und A. v. Wassermann. Dritte, erweiterte Auflage. Jena: G. Fischer; j Beilin und Wien : Urban und Schwarzenberg. 1928 und 1929. l Practical parasitology,9 as its name implies, is essentially a handbook for use in classes of human parasitology. Most of the parasites and their vectors encountered in the ordinary I course are discussed, and brief notes are given on their biology and pathogenicity. In addition to the protozoa, helminths, and arthropods, chapters are included on the spirochaetes, fungi, intermediate hosts, and on technique. There are numerous black-and-white illustrations, all of them full-page size and I well reproduced. The volume is excellently written, in easy ! French, by two well-known authorities and teachers, and it is published at a very low price. It will prove an invaluable laboratory companion to all students of the subject. In ancient times philosophers expatiated on morals, and sought after absolute goodness, truth, and beauty. The dis ! coveries of science, however, have compelled them to take I cognizance of human development and structure; hence the { numerous attempts to reconcile science, philosophy, and religion. I Of such efforts, From the Seen to the Unseen,10 by the Rev. j J. H. Best, vicar of Little Marlow, is certainly one of the most i readable. Mr. Best has read much; he possesses an extensive | knowledge of science, and he is clear in exposition. His object | is to prove the existence of purpose, and with relentless purpose ! he expounds the purposeful aims of Providence in the develop ! ment of man. We are led through the pathways of physiology, ; embryology, psychology, evolution, and astronomy with the idea that they all lead to the goal of conviction that man is the highest product of the Divine Mind. Religion would appear, from Mr. Best's arguments, to involve a kind of spiritual anthropomorphism. As the world is beautiful, we must attribute to the Divine Mind which designed it a feeling for beauty. So that the Divine Mind not only possesses intelligence and will, but also, like the human mind, is susceptible to emotion. Mr. Best believes that in every germ cell there is a "psyche," which in some way is part and parcel of the Divine Mind, and he argues skilfully that only on some such assumption can memory be explained. In fact, his chapter on memory, and his exposition of the weak points in theories that seek to explain evolution, from the pangenesis of Darwin to the latest views I on Mendelism, are among the cleverest things in the book. ? Towards the end, however, when Mr. Best begins to resume | the role of clergyman, and much poetry creeps into his text, he may be found less convincing. To the mi'nds of some the attempt to solve insoluble problems brings satisfaction. Others can only sum up their experiences by saying that they " came j out by the same door as in they went." S Our Tounis College11 is a collection of verses published in the students' magazines of Edinburgh University during the last century. The Students' Representative Council is responsible | for the production of the volume, and most of the selections are | verses by undergraduates that were published in The Student. ! Some of the verses bear well-known names, and especial mention l must be made of those by the late Professor Mair. Among these is his famous Greek rendering of the song " Clementine," in which the rhythms of the original are carefully preserved in ! the Greek. In a different vein is his beautiful lament for the vanished students, which was written in 1917. The great interest in the volume lies, however, in the average verse that i it contains?-verse which records the thoughts of youth for a century, sometimes cynical, sometimes sentimental, usually critical, changing with the changing generations, and yet always touched with the same enthusiasm and energy. Most i readers will find much to interest and amuse them in this volume, but it will, of course, appeal specially to that great band that is scattered over the five continents, the Edinburgh alumni. The Students' Representative Council and its editors are to be congratulated on having rescued from oblivion this interesting record of student thought. In the Writers* and Artists' Year Booh, 1929,12 those who are interested in the press as a market for their literary, artistic, musical, or photographic works will find much useful informa tion. The main feature is a directory of British and American publications, with notes on their requirements and scales of payment. Advice is also given on questions of copyright, publishers' agreements, etc. [ The British Goat Society's Year Book for 192913 contains, in I addition to articles and poems in praise of the goat?which, as ! 9 Travaux Pratiques de Parasit ologie.
