<plain_text><page sequence="1">AVRAHAM YASSOUR PHILOSOPHY - RELIGION - POLITICS: BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV AND LUNACHARSKY The awakening of interest in A. A. Bogdanov-Malinovsky's oeuvre, theories and activities has lasted about two decades,1 but was and still is very fruitful. This growth of interest has given rise to plenty of studies that have contri buted to our knowledge of Bogdanov's relations with Lenin and Plekhanov,2 his attitude toward and inferences from the 1905 revolution,3 and his stand point in the context of the revolutionary events from February to October 1917.4 The relevance of Bogdanov's theories is mentioned in comparative studies of Gramsci's contribution to Marxist theory5 and by scholars inter ested in the ProletkuVt policies6 following the Bolshevik revolution. The variety of writings concerning the extent of Bogdanov's accomplish ments will restore his place in the history of Russian philosophy and Soviet social thought. We know a great deal of the history of Bogdanov's rivalry with Plekhanov and Lenin, but little was done, to my present knowledge, to reveal Bogdanov's influence outside his Party and faction (Vpered). Due to some theoretical disagreements and factional splits among Marxists in Israel,7 a new direction of "Bogdanovist" influences has been explored and we have found some surprising political and ideological implications arising from his theoretical influence. This paper deals briefly with several interpretations given by Ber Borochov, the leader of the Jewish Marxist-Zionist labour party ? Poalei-Zion ["Workers of Zion" (Palestine)], who elaborated an original theory of the "national question"8 on the basis of the "Bogdanovist approach" to historical material ism.9 Ber Borochov also wrote a critical analysis of A. Lunacharsky's theory of religion10 based on Bogdanov's empiriomonist theory,11 and on his own "virtualism". Borochov's attitude toward the achievements of the February revolution and his reservations about the Bolshevik policy of pushing forward the revolution were similar to those of Bogdanov.12 His experience abroad and the new political realities on the eve of World War I brought Borochov, in his contributions to the Third Convention of the Jewish Social-Democratic Workers Party (Poalie-Zion) in Russia (in Kiev, August 1917), to clarify and redefine some of his former theoretical positions.

Reidel Publishing Company.</page><page sequence="2">200 AVRAHAM YASSOUR Curiously, Ber Borochov is absolutely unknown to most historians and analysts of Russian socio-political thought; his doctrine was not subject to general academic scrutiny outside Israel. A short biographical survey will be appropriate in order to place Borochov's contribution in context. Born on June 21, 1881, in Zolotonosky in the Ukraine, Borochov passed his youth and studies in Poltava,13 a center of active propaganda for socialism and Zionism (his father was a member of the "Lovers of Zion" group). He was an avid reader, inspired by travel-stories14 and later attracted to the study of languages, philosophy and economics. He studied the works of R. Avenarius, and was even praised by V. V. Lessevich, the well-known Russian empiriocriticist.15 Before graduation, he was familiar with the Russian illegal literature and, in his local Gymnasium, with anti-Semitism. He claimed later that he was an organizer of the Jewish self-defence group. In 1900 he joined the Russian S. D. Party in Ekaterinoslav, but was expelled a year later because of his independent controversial stance on the problems of nationalism and specific Jewish needs.16 He developed close relations with some of the leaders of the Russian Zionists (M. M. Ussishkin, Sh. Levin) and was involved in permanent controversies concerning Zionist ideology. Borochov became an organizer and a travelling lecturer-propagan dist. Addressing himself to the Jewish workers in a general spirit of socialist Zionist ideology, he necessarily confronted social democrats and Bundists17 ? both of them explicitly anti-Zionist. The challenge was, however, to attain a viable synthesis integrating Zionism with Marxism. That kind of integration meant a creative approach to the national problem, one not conforming to the prevailing orthodox Marxism of Kautsky and Plekhanov which ignored (as Marx) the growing importance of the need for a theory of nationalism. To my knowledge Borochov was one of the first to formulate a consistent Marxian theory to explain the phenomenon of nationalities and national conflicts. To be attracted, in fin de si?cle Russia, by possible combinations of Marxism with "scientific philosophies", was not at all original;18 Borochov's originality and achievement was to find there a solid base for his theory of nationalism and for Marxist Zionism.19 Referring to his Ekaterinoslav period, Borochov wrote: I used to imbibe freely of Karl Marx and Richard Avenarius. We were only lads of nine teen, but we knew Marx' Capital by heart. We agitated among the workers - Christian as well as Jewish - and distributed illegal pamphlets. My duty was to read Bogdanov's popular book Principles of Political Economy with the workers.20</page><page sequence="3">BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV, LUNACHARSKY 201 In 1902 Borochov published his essay 'The Nature of the Jewish Intellect', his original philosophical debut.21 The empiriocritical theory of R. Avenarius, alongside those of Marx and Bogdanov, impressed the young, talented, erudite Borochov immensely, even if he objected to some of their ideas. In his essay the intellectual characterisations of the outstanding Jewish geniuses are reduced to their convergence with perfect monism (philosophers: Moses Maimonides, Spinoza et al.; sociologists: Marx et al.; economist: David Ricardo). From this intensive period in Borochov's life we have a corpus of manu script notes and "thoughts"22 on ethics, philosophy and the social sciences. He became familiar with Marx' economics and sociology and with Bogdanov's empiriomonist critique of Avenarius, Mach and Marx. From now on we will find in Borochov's writings terms deriving from Avenarius and from Bogdanov's version of Marx' theories: "affectionals and virtuals", "relative distinct environment" (explaining individuality and differentiating nations), "national character is embodied in the character of the nation's geniuses",23 "monism" (and monotheism as a superior, preferred religion), "social co-ordination and selection", "socially-organized experience", "adaptation and harmony", etc. Ideology is considered a socio historical adaptation, having the power to mobilize social movements. Na tional survival by negative external selection was a seminal thesis for the further development of Borochov's national theories. Borochov joined the Poalei-Zion Party24 in 1905 and became involved in the vigorous debates of the scattered P?Z groups, travelling through the party branches in southern Russia, lecturing and debating day and night. This tenuously organized party searched for a viable synthesis of class-struggle ideology with Jewish national aspirations that could assure the adherence of the different groups to the Zionist ideology of the "Palestinians" (thus competing with the Minsk group known for its "territorialist" inclination). Borochov published To the Question of Zion and Territory,25 an important contribution to the ideological formation and integration of the young party. It was his task to convince his readers that territorial concentration of the Jewish people in Palestine would cure the anomaly of Jewish existence in exile and normalize the class struggle of the Jewish proletariat suffering from a twofold and abnormal oppression.26 After several splits, the first Conference of the "Palestinian" wing of P. Z. was convened in December 1906 and a program was adopted: Our</page><page sequence="4">202 AVRAHAM YASSOUR Platform21 ? formulated and edited by Borochov ? following intensive discussions on the program committee. Our Platform was written in Russian and published in Evreiskaya Rabochaya Khronika, the official organ of the party, edited by Borochov in Poltava. The subtitle was: 'What is the Jewish national question? How is it raised by the Jewish proletarian? How is he solving the problem?' In this program the "Borochovist" terminology: was developed "ex-territorial nations", national conflicts and the diversified attitudes of different classes to nationalism, "strategic base" for the class struggle and "proletarian Zionism" (expounding the vital need of the Jewish working class to achieve a sane and stable "strategic base", permitting the performance of their cardinal role in production). Earlier, in Berlin, Borochov had written his central theoretical book, Class Moments of the National Question, published in the Zionist monthly Evreiskaya Zhizn' in December 1905.28 To my knowledge, this is the earliest attempt to develop an extended Marxist theory of Jewish nationalism. It was a non-canonic Marxist approach to the national question, to normal and abnormal nations, and to national conflicts. Borochov used Marx' socio economic concepts "mode of production", "forces of production", "relations of production", etc. He developed the term "condition of production", found in the 3rd vol. of Das Kapital29 and constructed his theory to explain the existence of peoples and nations and their struggle : nations are said to appear and consolidate from the "relative diversity" of the natural and social conditions of production, and the national conflicts are defined as "conflicts between the development of the forces of production and the state of the conditions of production". A nation is a socio-economic organism; hence we have a two-fold division of mankind: peoples-nations and classes; history knows normal nations and abnormal ones (such as "landless nations", polit ically oppressed, and culturally deprived nations) which strive for normalcy and need a "therapeutic movement"30 to regain the status of a normal nation (one with territorial independence and normal "conditions of produc tion"). Borochov's theory of nationalism was adopted by some Zionist groups as a model of a therapeutic movement toward the normalisation of the "extra-territorial nation": the possession of an independent territorial base (the most important "condition of production") as a prerequisite for freedom, national self-determination and a "normal" class struggle that leads the nation to a socialist classless society. Summarizing his book, Borochov declared:</page><page sequence="5">BOROCHOV,BOGDANOV,LUNACHARSKY 203 Genuine nationalism is that nationalism which does not obscure class-consciousness. It is to be found only among the progressive elements of oppressed nations. ... (this) is presented in its minimum program. Such demands have the clearly marked aim to attain, by the establishment of the national under normal conditions of production, a normal work-place and base of struggle for the proletariat.21 Borochov stressed that the Jewish proletariat in Diaspora, as an oppressed class of a landless nation and compelled to emigrate, looks for a territory (in a "spontaneous (stichiny)" process) as a place of employment and for a sane and safe sovereign "strategic base" for survival and for its struggle for socialism; and in this quality it is the core of a progressive Zionist movement. This was a strong argument against the "Bund" and the "territorialists" (based, as Borochov argued, on the historical-materialist doctrine, that explains the attachment to Palestine as the only desired territory); at the same time Borochov became "the man who transformed Marxism from a deleterious to a constructive factor for Zionism".32 June 3, 1906, the day of the dissolution of the First Duma, was the night of Borochov's arrest by the Russian police.33 In prison he established a "People's University" and taught the prisoners his new theory of nationalism and national liberation. He gained influence over Ukrainian Democrats who adopted parts of his national theory and some of them called themselves "Borochovists". (Relations with Ukrainian Social Democrats would be renewed in 1917.)34 Those months in prison were productive: teaching, writ ing and collecting material for a projected philosophical study on ethics.35 Out of prison in 1907, he arrived in Minsk. He lived in Minsk and Vilno ? both centers of Jewish workers organisations ? where he studied and began to write in Yiddish. Later in 1907, he started his wandering years: Krakow, the Hague, Vienna and many party conferences. Lecturing and editing the party organ was his vocation and his main occupation. Marxist economy and sociology were to become the solid theoretical basis of the Poalei-Zion party. In the meantime, he collaborated on the writing of entries for the Russian Jewish Encyclopedia in the Yiddish language, becoming one of the first scholarly writers in the field of Yiddish philology.36 We know Borochov's interests in this period, according to his writings (pub lished in part posthumously): articles on the Jewish national abnormality;37 the unique characteristics of the Jewish labour movement (Borochov worked</page><page sequence="6">204 AVRAHAM YASSOUR in the Bund-Archives, kept then in Geneva): and his book, so important for our subject-matter, Virtualism and the Religious-Ethical Question in Marx ism 38 ? a critique of A. Lunacharsky's theories concerning religion and the proletarian attitude toward faith, known as "God-building".39 From the years 1907?1910 we have also a collection of excerpts and notes prepared by Borochov for his long-projected book on ethics and gnosiology.40 Borochov left Vienna when the First World War erupted, staying in the U.S.A. until the outbreak of the February Revolution in Russia. In the United States he was active in Poalei-Zion party work from 1915, organizing, lecturing, and participating in the debates among the party factions (he thought of himself as belonging to the "social-democratic" option for a critical historical materialism and defined himself as a socialist-anarchist concerning the future socialist society). In 1916 he published a series of articles in the Poalei-Zion Yiddish weekly on 'The Economic Development of the Jewish People',41 where he noted the two important phenomena in "Jewish economic production": (a) the preponderance of the element of human labor over the elements of nature; (b) the preponderance o? mental labour over physical labour,42 concluding his analysis by revealing that here he found "the chronic malady of Jewish history", a malady that has no remedy in exile, which is to say: "Zionism is the only movement capable of introducing reason, order and discipline into Jewish life. It is the only answer to the economic and historic need of the Jewish people."43 Another article published by Borochov, entitled 'In the Struggle for Jewish JRights', bears witness to his ideas concerning the dangers confronted by the Jewish people and democracy inside the Jewish community, com batting the wealthy assimilationists and cosmopolitan socialists. He was critical of the socialist parties supporting the war and also of the pro-Allied stand of the majority of his own party. "Proletarian Zionism" from the old Russian days was now transformed into a new political stand: "A national front against the anti-Zionist coalition" ("Anti-Zionist Front", 1911).44 In other articles he expressed his new thoughts and reconsiderations of the national problem in wartime and under the post-war arrangements. His fears and hopes were explicitly indicated in his intensive activity and writing, calling for "national self-help": Death and suicide are the most radical reliefs from disease. Similarly, assimilation is the most radical solution of the Jewish problem. Nevertheless, no medical expert would advise his patient to take poison for a cure. No honest statesman or idealist ever</page><page sequence="7">BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV, LUNACHARSKY 205 attempted to solve, for example, the Polish question by suggesting that the Polish people should cease existing. Furthermore, how would the Belgians, in their present plight, look upon anyone who gave them the excellent advice to assimilate with the Germans, and to cease to exist as an independent nation? Only to us Jews have self-appointed 'physicians' had the audacity and the shamelessness to preach national suicide. Political rights grow only through bitter struggle. Oppression maintains itself as long as the oppressed have not the strength to throw off the yoke and to institute a new equilibrium ... The emancipation of the Jewish people can be gained only by our own efforts ('National Helplessness Versus National Self-Help', 1915).45 Borochov considered himself obliged to return to Russia, as soon as possible, in the days of freedom after the February Revolution in 1917. On his way he passed through Stockholm to be part of the Poalei-Zion delegation to the Dutch-Scandinavian committee preparing the international socialist conven tion. He co-authored a memorandum dealing with the status of the Jewish people and the workers' movement in the post war era. Arriving in Russia, he participated in the Third All-Russian Poalei-Zion Convention held in Kiev (August 26 ? September 1,1917).46 The convention took account of the new realities of the national and international scenes. Borochov announced his plans and his intention to edit a revised version of Our Platform. (Reminicences bear witness that he abandoned his interpre tation of Zionism as a "stichic" deterministic process, emphasizing the prime role of the social elite, the vanguard halutzim, in the progress of Zionist realization in Palestine). Borochov was nominated to be a member of the Poalei-Zion delegation to the Conference of Nationalities convened in Kiev.47 He delivered a keynote address entitled 'The Federation of Nationalities in the New Russia', where he developed the idea that "a federal socialist republic", a free decentralized union of nations, is the only reasonable outcome from the successful Russian Revolution. His contribution was impressive and his campaign for national rights in Russia brought his nomination by the Conference to participate in the delegation to the projected "Democratic Assembly" in Moscow. But he died before he could take part, in December 1917 in Kiev. After Borochov's death fierce debates on Zionism, on the Bolshevik Revolution, on the British Mandate in Palestine, and on the meaning of constructive work in Palestine caused the Poalei-Zion party to split. In 1920 one part adherent to the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, and another part tried to continue along the path of "proletarian Zionism", remaining critical even concerning the realisation of socialism in Russia.</page><page sequence="8">206 AVRAHAM YASSOUR This sketch of Ber Borochov's life and accomplishments will allow us to compare Bogdanov's philosophy and sociology with Borochov's key positions on the national question and Lunacharsky's religious philosophy. A In the two decades before the 1905 Revolution, Marxism in Russia (or "Russian Marxism") was rent by deep divisions that came out in abundant theoretical debates.48 Russia's realities gave Marx the opportunity to specify his legacy; but what is called the "orthodox trend" was not very attractive. Even a cursory analysis shows that it is easy to recognise here all the possible interpretations of some ambiguities contained in the original texts. Among these, we know well Bogdanov's path from economic determinism to prole tarian culture. Such evolutions and splits among Marxists were defined in a sophisticated terminology as tension between the "nomological trend" and the "praxistic trend"49 and they seemed to characterise the revolutionary intelligentsia, dissatisfied with the lacunae in the original Marxian theoretical corpus. Ber Borochov declared himself a Marxist. In his first written publication he expressed his devotion to the monistic trend in philosophy and sociology, referring to Spinoza and Marx.50 He was strongly influenced by "the apostle of pure experience", R. Avenarius. After becoming familiar with Bogdanov's philosophical works, Borochov moved from empiriocriticism toward historical materialism in Bogdanov's earlier interpretation.51 Our author wrote of Marx as "our teacher". He used the nomenclature of a "realistic" and "collectivistic" worldview, trying to base his mature theory concerning the national question, nations and conflicts on his own Marxist and empirimonist exegesis.52 Ber Borochov was engaged in a controversy and dispute with the "territo rialist" movement among the Russian Jews. Looking for arguments within the common background, he managed to convince his adversaries that territory as a cure for Jewish national abnormality (landlessness), means only and exclusively Palestine (Zion). Borochov, dissatisfied with canonic Marxism, was looking for new developments and interpretations. From his attachment to empiriocriticism (insisting on the biological and economic functions of thought) he passed, under the influence of his prolific studies and originality, to consider Marx to be "the greatest thinker of the capitalist era".53 Over and over, he mentioned as his "masters": Avenarius, Mach, Marx and Engels,</page><page sequence="9">BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV, LUNACHARSKY 207 Nietzsche, Bogdanov.54 But, Borochov was a very independent and profound thinker. He developed his own variety of Marxism, traversing Bogdanov's empiriomonism, which he called "virtualism".55 Later, in 1915, he summarized his non-conformist uses of the Marxian theses and his attitude toward Marx: Historic necessity will deliver us into the promised land of socialism - this Marx con ceived, and this Engels popularized. Have we need to think any more? Are not all ques tions solved now? ? Marx was undoubtedly the greatest thinker of the nineteenth century. None has better analyzed the complex problems of our social organisation. But because Marx is dead and because new problems have arisen, we must think indepen dently and arrive at our own solutions; we must accustom the world to utilize its own mental faculties.56 B In his search for arguments against the "territorialist trend"57 Borochov was frequently in need of Plekhanov's version of historical materialism; but he was aware of the difficulties and the ambiguities that orthodox Marxism presents both to him and to his opponents, striving to convince them that the only "real" territory for the Jewish territorial concentration is Palestine ("Zion"). From the first collection of Borochov's Thoughts5* and his first two articles, we know about his distrust of old orthodoxies that he identified with the "authoritarian mode of thinking".59 He developed his argumen tation as appropriate for a "synthetic" and "realist" type of psychic struc ture.60 Borochov was familiar with Bogdanov's works from the first phase of his evolution,61 as is easily observable in his articles and "thoughts", where he is looking feverishly for a theoretically consistent explanation of the role of the intelligentsia and ideals in social movements.62 The problem was "Zion" (Palestine) or "Uganda" (any available territory) as the locus and focus for the national aspirations of the Jewish people and the practice of the pioneers (vanguard) of the Zionist movement.63 Borochov actually joined the "praxistic" variety of historical materialism and he found in Bogdanov's writings tools to define the role of the intellectuals in the spontaneous (stichinyf) process and the importance of organisation and consciousness for historical evolution.64 Borochov was also attracted by Bogdanov's as sumptions concerning "secular monism" as a worldview correlated with the "exchange stage" in human history.</page><page sequence="10">208 AVRAHAM YASSOUR Borochov was seriously involved in absorbing the "scientific philosophy" of Avenarius and passed from empiriocriticism to empiriomonism. He deals with all the complexities of this in his notes and excerpts, but in his articles we already find a new, amalgamated theory ? very original even if not always consistent.65 A keystone of this new approach was a theory of the "thera peutic movement" - an organisational culture using the remedy of a "posi tive ideal" against the "anarchic-psychic" state-of-mind of the followers of "territorialism". This kind of movement possesses the abilities to normalize disharmonies rooted in the pathological situations of a social organism.66 While a follower of Avenarius, Borochov decided to study Bogdanov's theories concerning selection and adaptation, conjunction and disjunction, adjusting processes and functional-organisational ideologies as adaptive techniques, increases and decreases in social energy, spontaneous movements toward elimination of internal and external contradictions and tendencies to restore harmony and soundness.67 Borochov developed for his own intellectual needs the conception of "plastic reaction". This is one of the Bogdanov's universal categories for expressing social processes with a supreme form of adaptive technique, related to a developed conscience and requiring an organisational ideology which is characteristic of a "synthetic psychological structure".68 In these categories of Bogdanov, Borochov found the components of his own original theory of therapeutic activity as regulative pioneering reaction to abnormal situations in a social organism. In this way, he achieved the elaboration of a set of arguments in favour of his theory on the priority and exclusivity of Zion-Palestine as the only territory attractive for the Zionist pioneers and militants.69 C Borochov was influenced by Bogdanov and others when the former elaborated his social and national theory, but he did not become entangled in the diffi culties of the organic bio-sociology70 when he wrote his major study on the national question.71 It is not accidental that this essay starts with a commen tary on a large quotation from Das Kapital. In this section we will try to indicate some similarities between Borochov's social categories and those found in his theory of normal and abnormal existence of nations, national and social conflicts and national liberation movements. We have no clear</page><page sequence="11">BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV, LUNACHARSKY 209 evidence that Borochov was aware of the cosmopolitan and nihilist attitudes of the various trends of European socialism toward nationalism in general and in particular toward the Jews.72 Neither Marx nor Kautsky nor Plekhanov developed a concise socialist theory of national diversity and a particular set of categories to explain the national question ? although they had done it concerning classes, their struggle, and social change. It was a common attitude in the socialist parties to ignore the importance of a theoretical foundation for an appropriate political approach to the national question (what is a nation?), the character of national conflicts and national aspirations, and the fight for survival of abnormal nations. Borochov succeeded in working out an original theory which explains the correlations between the division of humankind into classes and nations, and the interweaving of class struggle and national liberation.73 Borochov started with the observation that human society is divided along a twofold division: into classes and into nations. How do those diversities arise? He answers: "Our Masters" (in the Aesopean language of the Russian Marxists) explained the class divisions, the class struggle and the revolutions but they failed to formulate a theory which places the national factor in their elaborated social-revolutionary doctrine of social change. Groups which are differentiated according to their various relations of production are the social classes. "But what is responsible for the differences between the various societies which give rise to the whole national question and its concomitant struggles?" To answer this central methodological question, Borochov intro duced the category of "conditions of production",74 found in the third volume of Das Kapital. "Conditions of production" are geographic, anthro pological and historical. Production develops in dependence on certain conditions which are various and distinct in different natural and cultural environments. Consequently, In this conception of the 'conditions of production' we have a sound basis for the development of a purely materialistic theory of the National Question. For in it is contained the theory and the basis of National struggles - We, therefore, come to the formulation and explanation of the following two sorts of human groupings: (1) the groups into which humanity is divided according to the differences in the conditions of relatively distinct type of production are called societies, socio-economic organisms (tribes, families, peoples, nations); (2) the groups into which the society is divided according to their role in the system of production itself, i.e., according to their respec tive relations to the means of production, are called classes (castes, ranks, etc.) - the class struggle assumes the character of a social problem wherever the development of</page><page sequence="12">210 AVRAHAM YASSOUR the forces of production disturbs the constitutions of the relations of production. - the same is true of the national struggle. - The national problem therefore arises when the development of the forces of production of a nationality conflicts with the state of the conditions of production. - The assets of a social body lie in its control of the condi tions of production.75 The analogous ("monist") interpretation of class struggle and national con flicts is a key-thesis of what is called "Borochovism"; from this observation Borochov concluded that the nationalism ("the feeling of kinship created as a result of a common historic past and common conditions of production") of the different classes is diversified; classes have their own "conditions of production" and in accord with them they have diverse nationalist ide ologies76 and interests. From common harmonized interests arises the con science of solidarity, and a people becomes a nation dit this higher stage of its development; nationalistic world-views as ideologies reflect and reinforce modes of production, and their roots are in human productive practice, in work experience. Collective labor activity implies a collectivistic-solidarist ideology,77 as the common interest in particular. For the middle-class and for the proletariat the national territory is the focus: for the former as a market-place; for the latter as a work place and a strategic base for a sane development of the class struggle. Lack of class consciousness among the workers is accompanied by individualistic and chauvinistic ideologies which are due to the abnormal existence of their people. Oppressed nations offer an uncertain "strategic base" to the proletariat with national consciousness: the class struggle assumes national characteristics. The proletarian of oppressed or landless nations cannot achieve his socialist goals before the normalisation of his "conditions of production". His national ideology and struggle is a "real nationalism": a combination of a "therapeutic movement" to cure and liberate his nation with the revolutionary struggle for the abolition of the class society. Borochov applied these general theoretical assumptions to the particular situation of the Jewish people and proletariat in a programatic document of the Poalei-Zion party, Our Platform. It is argued there that the Jewish people falls under the category of abnormal nations as an extraterritorial (landless) one; their adjustment to their environment among other nations ("conditions of production") leads the Jews to assimilation, a "negative" kind of balance which is counter-balanced by their isolation. The Jewish pro letarian is remote from nature and from primary industries;79 he is subjected</page><page sequence="13">BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV, LUNACHARSKY 211 to a double oppression: social and national. This weak economic position ("work experience") strengthens his ideological solidarity. These peculiar deficiencies will be cured by the attainment of a safe and sound "strategic base" by settlement of the Jewish people on its own territory. But the choice of the national territory is not a free and deliberate choice; Jewish mass emigration and settlement are stichic80 processes but it is also vital to "organize and direct" the migration to its historical locus ? that is Palestine Zion. Territorial concentration or normalisation of the economic structure of the Jewish people will occur only in Palestine, where the class struggle will become "normal" and lead to complete socialist liberation. Borochov was sure that he had found a solid base to define the specific mission of the Jewish proletariat as a part of the Jewish modern national movement (Zionism). A clear statement is found in Our Platform : Territorialism apart from a particular territory is Utopian. - Abstract territorialism is an incomplete ideology of national emancipation; the whole and synthetic form is Zionism. - Because proletarian Zionism has recognized the spontaneous concentration of Jewish immigration into Palestine, it has completely shaken off all former Utopian concepts with regard to the realization of territorial autonomy. - Thus we have liquidated the "search for a territory". This task we entrusted to the inherent processes of Jewish immigration. Our task is not to find a territory, but to obtain territorial political auton omy in Palestine. - The bourgeoisie regulates the creative factors of the spontaneous process; the proletariat regulates the liberating factors. - We ask: 'What role can our will, out consciousness, play in the historical processes of Jewish life?' To the conscious interference of human will there must be added another factor, that of organisation. Organisation is not a mere sum of individual efforts, but rather a collective social force. Along with the historical social tendencies we must introduce planning. To regulate historical processes means to facilitate and accelerate their progress, to conserve social energy, and to obtain the optimum results from the labor put forth.81 A careful reading of Boro?hpv's Class Traits of the National Question and Our Platform, written in Russian in 1905?6,82 reveals clearly Bogdanov's influences on Borochov's social and political philosophy. To develop an original theory of nationalism implied going beyond Marx and the "Masters"; and Borochov did it as pajt of his political activity in the P. Z. party, adhering to the party's leading group. His account of ?ogdanov's philosophy and polit ical economy is mentioned in the reminiscences of his close friends83 and in his "thoughts". I find similar conceptual apparatuses in their writings concern ing definitions of class production, consciousness, class-character of ideologies and nationalism, psychic structure of different groups, "boycottage", etc.84</page><page sequence="14">212 AVRAHAM YASSOUR Introducing the conception of "conditions of production", Borochov tried to give a strictly monistic theory of class differentiations and national diver sities ("the twofold division of humankind"). "Monism" was accepted as the "scientific" postulate by Bogdanov and Plekhanov. Bogdanov was even more extreme in his view on the unity of nature ("conditions") and society. And more: the influences and the motivation for human activity emerging from the natural environment is accentuated by Bogdanov in his manual of political economy and several other writings.85 Both use functional defini tions for classes ("domination", "subordination", "organisation"), class consciousness, and "productive" classes.86 Bogdanov wrote about "forces of production" and "conditions of work" of the proletarian class and analyzed the "class character" of Russian liberalism87 in a way similar to what we found in Borochov's analysis of the nationalism of the great landowners, of the great bourgeoisie, of the middle-class and of the proletariat. Those classes that have the diverse relations to the "conditions of production" develop their proper ideologies: Genuine nationalism in no way obscures class-consciousness. It manifests itself only among the progressive elements of oppressed nations. The genuine nationalism of the progressive class of the organized revolutionary proletariat of an oppressed nation expresses itself in the strong, clearly-defined demands embodied in its minimum program. It is the purpose of these demands to assure the nation normal conditions of production, and to assure the proletariat a normal base for its labor and class-struggle.88 Borochov used the term "natural selection" to explain the survival of the adapting groups ("social organisms") and from the "psychic selection" he deduced the "collective character" of social groups. The adaptation process is a "socially organized experience" which is expressed in ideology and nationalism.89 Dealing with the nationalism of the great landowners which interweaves with their traditionalism, Borochov cites Bogdanov's theory on "authoritarian thought" concerning traditionalism and metaphysics. These are related to the hierarchical structure of "domination and obedience", known also from their being the core of the bureaucracy and army. In this context, Bogdanov is praised as "one of the best-known thinkers of our time".90 In the existence of oppressed nations the "energy balance" is destroyed and the lack of harmony is expressed in chauvinism and violent nationalism.91 The "real (genuine) nationalism" is a nationalism that does not obscure class consciousness, because its aim is to restore normalisation of the "conditions</page><page sequence="15">BOROCHOV,BOGDANOV,LUNACHARSKY 213 of production" and the "relations of production". Borochov's analysis of the bourgeois intelligentsia reminds us of Bogdanov's attitude toward it, on several occasions, where he identifies consciousness, being, sociality, ideology and work-practice.92 Borochov idealizes the Jewish proletariat just as Bogdanov talked about the proletarians as owners of the properties of the "synthetic psychic structure" ? a psychic type which is able to combine organisation with work-performance and will be that of the builder of the future state (i.e. socialist society in the Aesopian language).93 In similar logical inferences Borochov declares the "progressive elements", and later-on, the Jewish proletariat, as having the mission of being the historical agent for Jewish territorial redemption in Zion. D We have a bunch of notes, excerpts and original thoughts94 from the time when Borochov left Russia until he went to the U.S.A. These are mostly in Russian even though he had already then started to write on Yiddish philology. In a preliminary draft for a book on the national question,95 Borochov is much more explicit concerning his theoretical inspirations and well aware of the lacunae in his already published works. His compendium starts with a general introduction to his "gnosiological premisses", namely: "The general trends in the modern theory of knowledge; Hume's problem; Kant; the immanent-monism; Mach; Avenarius' empiriocriticism; Guyau's sociomor phism; Marx and Engels; Nietzsche; Bogdanov's empiriomonism", etc. A second paragraph is devoted to the inquiry into "historical materialism", dealing with problems like base and superstructure; social collectives; what is a social problem and what is a social movement? biological necessity; "stychic processes"; historical necessity and conscience; immanent and transcendent historical necessities; the social problem and the national problem as conflicts, etc. Other parts of this compendium are: different definitions of nation (development of social organisation; critique of Otto Bauer's theory); the national and the social in our days (capitalism and the national problem; class characteristics of nationalism); the modern national movements (minorities, extraterritorial nations); national autonomy and national equal rights. In the second part of the collection of his Thoughts from the years follow ing 1907, we find numerous excerpts and notes commenting on Bogdanov's writings, on Nietzsche, Stirner, Schopenhauer, Spencer, Kant, Spinoza,</page><page sequence="16">214 AVRAHAM YASSOUR Marx, Lunacharsky, Gorky and others.96 There is no specific subject-matter for all his Thoughts; we find there notes on politics and on ethics, philoso phical hints and psychology of nations, and a whole range of excerpts accord ing to the changing focus of his political and intellectual interests in those years of wandering. But the inclusive corpus of Thoughts sets the tone for the subject-matter of Borochov's further preoccupations. From a letter written to his friends we know that when Lunacharsky's first volume of Religija i socializm91 appeared, Borochov decided to work on a critical review of Lunacharsky's theory.98 Arguing on religion was popular in post-revolutionary times among Russian intellectuals.99 It was self-evident that Borochov was concerned with "ideological" problems and preoccupied with his search for an understanding of national sentiments of traditions (especially Jewish). He followed with interest new publications, reacted critically and developed his own viewpoint. At that particular time, Borochov (residing in Belgium) referred to Bogdanov's empiriomonism (the "philosophy of living experience") as an integrated new and holistic worldview 10? and from this point of depatrture he made an original attempt to submit Lunacharsky's theses to a critical analysis. In doing so he concluded to a set of tenets intitled "Virtualism which may solve the problems raised in Lunacharsky's new (Promethean or proletarian) religion".101 What is Virtualism? In Borochov's letter it is defined as follows: Virtualism is a psychology which deals with the psychic life and Ufe in general as "based" on active motion of the organism and not on passive perceptivity of external irritations; not sensation but movement; not sensorial reactions but motor activities. (Virtualism) does not grasp reality in reducing it to the data of "pure experience" but postulates the world as a non-exhausting struggle of powers. The basic element of religion "I saw in emotion and intellectual passivity" and in the human and social self-splitting which contradicts the conscious activity of the new human person; "the proletarian morality is prospective", enlightened activity, inspired by "historical necessity". Borochov pro mises to deal with labor as prerequisite for consciousness and with the phenomenon of "God-seeking" from the standpoint of "Marxist analysis of the moral conscience, corre lated directly to the evolution of the relations of production in society."102 For a young erudite this is an awesome task; even for a genius. But not all that was promised was realized. "Virtualism" was Borochov's attempt to surpass empiriomonism and orthodox Marxism,103 and to develop his own "virtualistic Marxism" as a worldview, based on and surpassing Bogdanov's empiriomonism, but capable of explaining the phenomenon of religion and of facing the need to reply to the "ethical problem in'scientific socialism".</page><page sequence="17">BOROCHOV,BOGDANOV,LUNACHARSKY 215 Borochov starts accordingly. His book states that the religious "seekers" are not newcomers among the socialists, but his attention is attracted to Lunacharsky, "prophet of a new religion", who is an adept of Avenarius and a follower of Marx,104 and who uses anthropomorphic and sociomorphic metaphors in his exposition of the positive sides of religion. Borochov is developing his critique and his "virtualist worldview" from "Bogdanovist" positions. At this point Borochov describes his personal path from empiriocriticism ? the doctrine that "purified experience" ? passing through class, party and national struggles, where he experienced "living life", through the "flames of the revolution" (1905), when the "last sensualist layers" were flooded by the waves of the social quarrels. When he approached the working masses, he confesses, he felt another purification of experience, this time from the "fetishist blend". Adding practice to contemplation (sensations) the "author become a Marxist, a virtualist".105 The difference between "Marxism" and "virtualism" is obscure today; in the context of his days, it seems that Borochov sees "virtualism" as his original variety of Marxism, meant to be a "Bogdanovist Marxism" applied to the problems of nationalism, tradition, religion and ethics.106 The theoretical base was his understanding of the relations between labor and consciousness, solutions of disharmonies by organized collectives, the new world picture and the new image of the "future state". Borochov charges Lunacharsky with substituting the old animistic-fetishist religions by his "socialist religion" which is supposed to offer "a meaning" to our existence and to procreate the "new proletarian world-evaluation". Borochov is sure that it is "illogical tp apprehend world-evaluation beyond the animistic faith. Anthropocen trism failed. Scientific socialism transcends, once and for all, the problem of world-evaluations; world-evaluation is beyond good and evil on the cosmic scale".107 "Virtualism" seems to be conceived by Borochov as his original con tribution to the development of Marxism. It is very close to Bogdanov's version and uses many of Bogdanov's conceptions to develop a gnosiological methodology, critical of the reminiscences of the empiriocritical-sensual ap proach. The critical review of Lunacharsky's premisses for his "God seeking" is an attempt to advance Bogdanov's cognitive models based on "collective labour practice". In the meantime, Borochov is deducing a "pluralistic monism" which implies not dealing with all phenomena only as degrees of</page><page sequence="18">216 AVRAHAM YASSOUR "organized labor experience" and "technical adjustments". He is opposed to static bio-mechanics and favors an active dynamism of vital aggressivity which firmly increases human potentialities to overthrow every fetishist characteristic due to authoritarian thinking. The author's promise is to supplement "sociomorphism" with Marx' theory about the derivative char acter of religious phantasies (developed in his critique of Feuerach and Strauss and in the writings on commodity fetishism).108 Borochov mentions some obscurities in Marx' "psychology"; e.g. in his treatment of the problems of labor. His interest is anthropology: con sciousness is the crystalised collective labor experience, which frees man from external causality; consciousness is a specific form of human autonomous activity, derivative from his labor practice. The author is aware that this is "common to the progressive adepts of Marxism", and he mentions Bogdanov and Lunacharsky, including Bogdanov's writings (beginning with Poznanie, etc. to Ocherki po filosofii marksizma).109 But Borochov wonders how Lunacharsky can proclaim that "socialism is a religion" and explains that his failure is methodological: has he not understood that animism is a constant component of every religion? This was also expressed by Plekhanov.110 To find a religion without God as Lunarcharsky tried (mentioning Spinoza's pantheism) is impossible and it is a result of his "too broad definition of religion". In the "virtualist point of view, religion is always identical with cult".111 According to Borochov, Lunacharsky is "deviating" from Marx' theory when he derives religion from human nature and the individual psyche".112 Borochov is referring to Marx' famous theses against Feuerbach (theses 6 and 7) in his critical argument. The third chapter of Virtualism is devoted to a general "view of religion in the light of virtualist Marxism",113 and Borochov deals there with animism, cults (as "active emotions") and different contem porary theories of religion. He mentions the roots of his Virtualism in the teachings of thinkers like Mikhailovsky, Nietzsche, Guyau, Spinoza ("who was a great virtualist under the heavy scholastic rind"), and Marx, who developed his conception of "forces of production" as a criterion for progress, providing virtualism with "its social character, by translating into sociological language what the bourgeois virtualists have expressed in a language of pure biology".114 This achievement, says our author, allows us to evaluate realities from the point of view of the "virtualistic ideals" of growth or degeneration, as accepted in Bogdanov's Strana idolov i filoso fija marksizma and sometimes even by Lunacharsky.115</page><page sequence="19">BOROCHOV,BOGDANOV,LUNACHARSKY 217 "Religion is a passive connection to fetishes and to other objects of the living animistic faith. Lunacharsky's (fallacy) is his ardent will to vindicate religion and to join together religion with socialism. But it is an impossible mission to impose passiveness and saintliness on socialism", Borochov as serts.116 He claims that Lunacharsky is heavily influenced by Feuerbach; that faith is the weakening of knowledge, as even Avenarius was aware, and that Bogdanov explained correctly the deliberately willed character of faith and its subordination to authority.117 Borochov declares that his aim is to accomplish this analysis. Curiously, all of them were different kinds of "Nietzschean Marxists".118 Borochov cites abundantly Nietzsche "as a model of virtualist posing of the problem";119 but he always returns to the empiriomionist theses: "all is produced by collective experience"; "the religious consciousness is an authoritarian sociomorphism", etc.;120 and Borochov admits that he cannot say more than Bogdanov has already written concerning the social genesis of religion, e.g. that "the religious consciousness is an authoritarian socio morphism".121 But in a note he expresses his reservations about Bogdanov's thesis about the conservatism of the main organisational forms of labour and thought; some elements of the authoritarian model of thought lasted and they are observable in the renewed temptation to revive religion. The new (modern) human person, enlightened and autonomous in his creative work and in shaping his fate, is less-and-less subjected to inner splits; this evolution eliminates religious superstitions (Borochov uses Bogdanov's 'Sobiranie cheloveka').122 Borochov admires some of Lunacharsky's pages where he exposes ideals of social justice,123 but he is critical concerning Lunacharsky's "social escha tology and his indulgence toward bourgeois ideologists".124 Life is always activity, aggressive initiatives in dealing with nature, objectively summarized collective labor, experience ? as conceived by "the consequent virtualist point of view". Religious feelings and world-evaluation are relived past experiences, reified "affectionals" and anthropomorphisms.125 The "future society" which will be rational, "labor organized", will reach "a stable balance with nature"; "the morals of behavior" or "ethics of life" (as was practiced in Pythagorean and Christian communities and in the modern proletarian organisations) will reign in highly organized collectivist society.126 In this context the ethics of life is " . .. practical idealism"; practical idealism is eternal; religion is nothing else than a configuration of such a kind of "idealism". What Lunacharsky calls "the new (needed) socialist religion"</page><page sequence="20">218 AVRAHAM YASSOUR is the ethics of life of the proletarian class, which deals with the relations of production. In the future socialist society this will change completely: only the growth of the social forces of production will be the proletariat's concern.127 "The ideal of the proletariat is not a biological one, but a social one: it is not the wholeness of the species, but the growth of the forces of production of the social collective. On this point, Lunacharsky's position is fallacious and logically unsound."128 The "socialist ethics of life" rejects the "belief in justice"; it is an "act of theoretical and moral risk", of venture into historical necessity, meant as hope and chance, which inspires "a melan cholic quality of bravery" and proletarian "Stoicism", far from apathy.129 In this "proletarian idealism" there is a drop neither of religion nor of animism. "We find a religious psychology among some social democrats, but it is nonsense to talk about a religion of socialism. Lunacharsky's Atheism and his Religion and Socialism are like the Book of Psalms in a modern style, odes in praise of the species and labor ? but socialism has its own (different) romanticism. ? We reject every mysticism". Lunacharsky brought a lot of light and beauty into our proletarian culture; "he deserves our thanks, but if in our camp there are preachings for a new religion, our definitive answer is a refusal to accept it".130 E Last but not least, there were the problems of the "boycottist-otzovist" policies, as an aspect of proletarian revolutionism. Borochov asserts that the "economy of energy" is a subordinate element in the case of the pro letarian attitude toward religion as is his position with regard to parliamen tarianism. The principal criterion should be: "will parliamentarianism amplify the influence and increase the capacity of the proletariat to govern the prevailing tone of social life?"131 We will try to sound Borochov's intentions on two occasions: the Duma elections, and the days of 1917. (I) Bogdanov's argument is well-known: after the boycott of the consul tative "Bulygin Duma" he and a group of other socialists supported strategies of boycott, "otzovizm" (recall of the Duma deputies) and "ultimatism" (subordination of the Duma-faction to the C. C. of the Party) which split the RSDRP and the Bolshevik faction in the perod of the Tammerfors (Bolshevik) Conference in December 1905, the Stockholm Congress (April 1906), the All-Russian Conference in Kotk (July 1907), the meeting at</page><page sequence="21">BOROCHOV, BOGDANOV, LUNACHARSKY 219 Gorki's house (Capri, April 1908), the meeting of the editorial board of Proletarii and the formation of the Vpered ("Forward") group.132 The conflict between "parliamentary" and "revolutionary" tactical tendencies (maybe they really were different strategies), was a good oppor tunity for a discussion, "seeking parallels with the German revolution. The Russian S. D. now asked: should we persevere with the tactics of '1847' or go over to those of '1849'?"133 Participation in elections, working within the Duma etc., was conceived as giving legitimation to the "pseudo-parlia ment" and an anti-revolutionary policy for the Party which would then be concentrated around legislation and the pettiness of parliamentary routine ("parliamentarian cretinism"). The time of reaction is the time for raising revolutionary consciousness and cultural hegemony (proletarian collectivism) as a preparatory phase for the coming socialist revolution.134 Controversies concerning the Duma arose as well in the Poalei-Zion party. Borochov's position was favorable to boycott of the elections to the First Duma. The "active boycott" was a common tactic in 1905-6 for the Jewish "Bund" and for the P. Z. party until the P. Z. party conference in Grodno (October 1906) which decided by a tiny majority to participate in the elec tion to the Second Duma.135 In the same resolution of the party conference it was decided to participate in the Zionist Movements' Congress (a pluralistic, broad national alignment). But several P. Z. party branches of the Russian P. Z. were favorable to the boycottist tactics, until the All-Russian P. Z. conference (held in Vienna on September 1909) proclaimed a definitive change of strategy. Borochov wrote at that time that the "otzovist" trend is disappearing and there is no more reason to remain loyal to the old tactical resolutions. Riapczynski remembers Borochov as being sympathetic to Bolshevism and radicalism.136 On the eve of the Stockholm, "unification", Congress, Borochov was favorable to the Bolshevik faction in general.137 He mentioned that their loyalty to the majority decision does not mean acceptance of those tactics concerning the participation in the Duma elections.138 In the new circum stances there are no hopes in that "impotent Duma" and it is only "con stitutional illusions" that motivate the Menshevik majority.139 Borochov published an article, 'The First Duma\ in which he wrote that the activities of the Duma put an end to the "constitutional" and "patriarchal" illusions of the masses, and time for revolutionary actions is coming.140 Well-known tones! Concerning the Second Duma, Borochov condemned Kadet opportunism and</page><page sequence="22">220 AVRAHAM YASSOUR the Menshevik thesis that even a Kadet-Duma is "revolutionary tool",141 and what is needed is a "revolutionary Duma" of workers and peasants against the Tsarist autocracy. Freedom, he declares, will be conquered by revolution. Following the disbanding of the Second Duma, he wrote (in July 1, 1907) that nothing was achieved and the strategy of boycott was appropriate anew - "but for the moment we say frankly: ignoramus".142 In his speech at the P. Z. party Conference in Vienna Borochov talked about the activity of the S.-D. faction in the Third Duma, mentioning that the P. Z. party was consistent in boycotting the elections, but the Russian working class and the Jewish workers are still interested in the S.-D. faction's activity in the Duma. The "otzovists" disappeared (only the S. R. party remained "boycottist"), he says, and we P. Z. are alone in keeping to our old positions. The Duma faction's activity is not satisfactory concerning the problems of the national question, and especially in regard to Jewish national ones; but it has done positive work and it is our duty now to support the Duma faction. "Boycottism is a strategy in time of revolution";143 P. Z. parties in other countries are participating in parliamentary work, and they have good reasons. Borochov's draft for a resolution was confirmed by the majority of the Conference.144 Before the election to the Fourth Duma (Winter 1912), he published an article, 'What Should be our Party-Line?', where he poses the question: should the new election campaign be according to the "class-line" or the national movements? The "neutralist" Bund decided in favor of a class-line, de-emphasizing anti-Zionism. But the most desirable could be a "united class-line of all the Jewish workers".145 Later, at a con ference of the Russian P. Z., a resolution demanding that the S.-D. faction in the Fourth Duma initiate laws assuring civil rights for the Jews and bringing an end to "The Pale" was put forward.146 (II) The split between the "Leninist" Bolsheviks and the "Bogdanovists" was definitive in 1909?1910. During the First World War Bogdanov served as a doctor at the front. He adopted the "internationalist position" toward the war and predicted the coming crisis of 1917. He was not opposed to an armed revolution but he had fears that the situation in Russia is not "ripe" for the socialist revolution. This was the reason for his support of a democratic republic and for a Constituent Assembly and he required a phase *of cultural (proletarian) building and of strengthening the proletarian con sciousness of the masses.147 The February Revolution, being a "democratic revolution", was supposed to establish "democratic institutions". After the</page><page sequence="23">BOROCHOV,BOGDANOV,LUNACHARSKY 221 July Crisis, Bogdanov preferred "a revolutionary democracy" and some sort of socialist coalition which would lead to the Constituent Assembly and to universal, equal and secret franchise. This revolutionary democracy should be organized as a "people's state"148 and will be the transitional phase to socialism. What we know about Borochov's positions and thoughts when he returned to Russia (August 24, 1917) is surprisingly close in principle to Bogdanov's positions. Unfortunately, we have only sporadic documents and knowledge concerning his attitudes and deeds of that very short period in his life (he died December 4, 1917).149 Borochov participated in the Third Convention of the P. Z. party (in Kiev from August 26 to September 1) and, from what was published in those busy days of revolutionary events, we know about the disputes inside the party and in particular Borochov's controversial stands expressed in the debates on Russian realities and Jewish-Zionist problems. Borochov was very active and from his speeches at the P. Z. convention and the "Peoples Assembly" convened in Kiev (September 8?16, 1979) we know about his new stands and emphases. He warned his party against a pre mature adherence to the Bolshevik strategy. He expoused f?d?ralisation and autonomy for the Ukrainian people (Ukrainian representatives were present at the P. Z. Convention and they were saluted with cries: "Long live Ukrainian territorial autonomy!"). Borochov represented his party at the "Peoples Assembly", gathered on a Ukrainian initiative, where he clamored for "per sonal national autonomy" for the Jews. He represented the P. Z. party at the Fourth Congress of the Ukrainian S.-D., where he declared the political and national programs of both parties to be similar. The P. Z. party adopted the "internationalist" stand on the questions of war and peace and concern ing the unity of Russia.150 After his stay abroad, especially in the U.S., Borochov had some new ideas concerning the specific Jewish national question: problems of the dynamic of Jewish emigration; socialist solutions for oppressed and landless nations, that he prepared for presentation at international socialist forums. He now favored explicitly political activity of conscious agents interfering in the "stychic" processes of Jewish emancipation: "It is time ... to demand our right to build our own home" and to concentrate constructive efforts in a proletarian imperative.151 When Borochov wrote in 1905: "Investigators who ignore the role of the</page><page sequence="24">222 AVRAHAM YASSOUR conditions of production and concern themselves exclusively with the rela tions of productions, are not in a position to comprehend the national question"152 he opened a new path for a radical-progressive synthesis of socialism with national liberation. In his eulogy, delivered in the name of the Ukrainian Rada, Vasilevsky called Borochov the leader and fighter for the rights and liberation of the Jewish and the Ukrainian proletariat. With good reason we may conclude that Borochov's writing and statements assured a long career to his theory, beyond pre-Israeli Zionism and Marxist socialism.

Frankel, Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism and the Russian Jews, Cambridge, 1983. 17 The "Bund" (General Jewish Workers' Alliance) founded in 1897, the leading Social ist party active among Jewish proletarians and artisans, considered itself a Russian Socialist party for the Jewish worker; the party propaganda conducted in Yiddish, was anti-Zionist. Although the Bund was militant in all political and union problems, it took a "neutral" stand concerning the future of the Jewish nation. 18 See: A.

Borochov's Marxian approach to the problems of the Jewish national movement was original and non-orthodox. Before he developed the Marxist Zionist doctrine there were different other theories based on synthesis of socialism with Zionism (A. Lieberman, N. Syrkin and others). Cf. J. Frankel (Note 16, above). 20 Cf. Borochov's article, 'At the Cradle of Socialist Zionism', published in New York, 1916. See: Nationalism and the Class Struggle, New York, 1937,^p. 180, Note 2: "My duty was to read Bogdanov's popular book, Principles of Political Economy, with the workers, explaining it to them in simple words and by concrete illustrations. I do not remember what made me change my ideas. It must have been after a chance joint meet ing of Jewish and Christian workers that the truth of Socialist Zionism dawned on me. Years later Pazniakoff again became a devout Christian mystic. Taratuta became a terrorist anarchist and fell in an armed struggle. What can an expelled Russian Social Democrat do when he becomes a Zionist "unbeliever"? I joined a large educational club of Jewish students and made them the first Poalei-Zionists in Russia".

Mintz edited and published an Index to the "Thoughts" of Ber Borochov (Philosophy and Ideas about Society and Nation), Tel Aviv, 1975 (Diaspora Research Institute), 249 pp. 23 "Thoughts" - Index and Mintz, op. cit., 46-47; 81-82. 24 Mintz, op. cit., ch. 3. 25 'K voprosam o Sione i teritorii', in: Evreiskaja Zhizn\ 1905, 6, 79-110; 7, 69-110; 8, 41-73; 9, 27-66, 10, 32-49.

For different purposes this book was deliberately translated, adapting the basic terminology to a Plekhanovite orthodox version, as the first Hebrew translation in 1928 shows. This popular version was translated into English: Nationalism and Class Struggle N.Y., 1937,135-166. There is an adequate new Hebrew translation, in Works 1,154-180. 29 Borochov cites Marx from a German edition, translating into Russian the relevant passages. See the English translation, pp. 135-1 ; Das Kapital, I?III, MEW, Bde. 23-25. 30 'Thereapeutic movement' is a term developed in Borochov's article 'On Zion and Territory'; Works I, 49 and Note 49. Borochov uses this term for "conscious practice" as distinct from "stichic spontaneous" movement. See: Mintz, pp. 145?151. 31 The National Question and the Class Struggle, Chicago, 1935, p. 44. The Russian 1906 text is: "real'nyj nacionalizm - eto imeno tot tip kotoryj ne zatemnjaet klassovogo samosoznanija. Vstrechaetsija on tolko v stede peredovych ugnetennych nacij," p. 32. A sane class structure is the conditio sine qua non for the normalisation of national life and the class struggle. See: S. Ben-Nahum, 'Borochov's Doctrine: What Remains Valid and what Passed away?', Hedim, 75-76,1964. 32 Kollat, op. cit. p. 235. This is not the place to explain the details of the "prol?tarisa tion" debate; see Mintz, pp. 59-62. 33 According to Mintz, Borochov was arrested in July 1904 and from then on there are files on him in the Okhrana Archives. The second arrest dates from July 18, 1906. The first arrest was for self-defence activities.

Until 1905 they were active inside the Zionist organisation. Some of the "territorialists" used "historical materialist" arguments. 58 The first collection of "Thoughts" is a collection of excerpts, aphorisms and notes from May 1902 and 1905. Mintz published a bunch of them concerning 'The Jewish National Question', in: Zionism, Studies in History of the Zionist Movement III, Tel Aviv, 1973, 502-519. From an index of names we can infer his theoretical interests at that particular time. 59 "Authoritarian mode of thinking" in this use is the Bogdanovian term. At that time</page><page sequence="28">226 AVRAHAM YASSOUR Bogdanov's books and articles had already appeared and Borochov was familiar with the most important of them and maybe with all of them. 60 Works I, 91 -92; Bogdanov distinguished 3 types of "psychic structures", namely the electric, the anarchic and the synthetic, which is the most progressive and realistic one. 61 Concerning the periodisation of Bogdanov's evolution, see Vucinich, 1976, p. 210 and my 'Bogdanov - La voie de l'empiriomonisme', Cahiers de IT.S.E.A., Paris, 176 (1966), 141. 62 Mintz, p. 78-79. 63 'K voprosam o Sione etc.', Works I, 63-65 and the collection of Thoughts published in Zionism III, 506 cf. (in the original Russian and translated into Hebrew). 64 "Since the Jewish nation has no peasantry our analysis of its national problem deals with urban classes; ... a new and conscious element is required. The Jewish emi grating masses must be organized and their movement directed. That is the task of the conscious Jewish proletariat. The schema of the dynamics of Jewish Ufe operates as follows: (1) emigration of the petty bourgeoisie who turn to prol?tarisation; (2) con centration of Jewish emigrants; and (3) organized regulation of the emigration. The first two factors are the products of the spontaneous processes operating in Jewish life; the last, however, is introduced by the organized Jewish proletariat'. Selected Essays in Socialist Zionism, London, 1948, 45, 49. For similarities in methodology (spontaneous ness, organisation, hegemony), see Zochor, op. cit., on Bogdanov and Gramsci). 65 Mintz, 81-85 and Note 95 on p. 82. He is analyzing the excerpts, 1526, 1613,1661, 1711, 1751, 1871, and 1887 of the Thoughts, where Borochov deals with Bogdanov's writings. 66 Mintz (p. 145) claims that Borochov was then completely persuaded by Bogdanov's social methodology; but it seems to me that in Bogdanov's "philosophy of living experi ence" and organisation, the "social organism" is merely a "structured" part of nature and "subject of self-adjusting natural processes" (Vucinic, pp. 210?212). Borochov was acquainted with the organicist theories of that time (Mintz, p. 146, quoting Lilienfeld, Worms, Schaffle and Fouill?e - all of them figuring also in Vucinich's Index). 67 Excerpt 1887 and Mintz, pp. 147-151.

The place mentioned in Das Kapital is: MEW, 25, 799 [Produktionsbedingungen]. 75 Nationalism, etc., 1937, 136-141. In the more adequate Hebrew translation, Works I, 154-159, we have a more explicit expos? of Borochov's relations to other thinkers like Bogdanov's notions on society as extension of the natural environment, and adap tation and "psychic selection" as basis for a collective character ; and Sombart's twofold division of human society {Works 1,156-7). 76 Marx and Engels, Kautsky and Plekhanov have not in their vocabulary the notion "condition of production" for different classes. Similar definitions by Borochov may be found in Bogdanov's Kratkij kurs ekonomicheskoj nauki, Moskva 1897 (The Hebrew translation is from a 1924 edition). In our time, Olafson has written: "The geography in question is human geography. . . All too often this interdependence of natural setting and human activity has been for gotten or left implicit ... in the geographic sections of history books" (Olafson, F. A., The Dialectic of Action, Chicago, 1979,140). 77 Cf. Jensen, pp. 115-119 on empiriomonism as a "labor worldview". Every chapter in Bogdanov's Kratkij kurs etc. has a paragraph dealing with ideology as reflection and reinforcement. 78 'Nasha Platforma', in Evreiskaya Rabochaya Khronjka, 1906, No 11, 2, 3 and Molot, 1906, 2; Hebrew: Works 1,193-310; Enghsh: Nationalism, etc., 1937,183-205. 79 One aspect of the problems faced by the P. Z. party was the definition of the Jewish proletariat and the processes of prol?tarisation of the Jewish petty-bourgeoisie. The abnormal national existence of the Jews determined the occupational distribution of all the groups and classes and increased the "process of declassification". From that "labor practice", characterised by their weak position in production, emerges the peculiar ideology. For a discussion on the problems of the Russian proletariat, see Marxism in Russia, 1983 (N. Harding's introduction). 80 By "stichic" process Borochov means historically necessary processes, without the intervention of conscience and will ? a meaning that was common among his contemporaries. Bogdanov used this term in his manual of political economy. (Hebrew, 9, 169). Later, in 1917, Borochov used "stichic" to name "organic processes" that include a strong voluntaristic-pioneering element. See: Nationalism etc., 1937, pp. 127-128 and 200. 81 'Our Platform', in Nationalism, etc., 1937, pp. 201, 203-5. 82 For the Class moments, etc. see our note supra.
