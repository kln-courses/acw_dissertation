<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMUEL BECKETT AND TRADITION PATRICK MURRAY ONE of the most notable features of Beckett's work for the stage is its rich vein of comedy. It is not without reason that Waiting for Godot is called a tragic-comedy. Beckett is able to suggest more successfully than any modern dramatist that 'there is a humour that treads the brink of tears, and tragedy which needs but an infinitesimal shift of perspective to disclose the infinitely varied riches of comedy'.' The situations in which the characters find themselves may be painful and apparently hopeless; time and again, however, Beckett makes us laugh with them as they reveal the macabre or grotesque side of their predicament or that of their fellow sufferers. There is comedy in the feeble, pathetic, sentimental mutterings of Hamm's legless parents Nagg and Nell in Endgame as they converse and make requests from their dustbins. They even find their present situation diverting. 'Do you remember', asks Nagg, 'when we crashed on our tandem and lost our shanks?' They laugh heartily. 'Nothing is funnier than unhappiness,' Nell tells him soon after. The treatment of tragic or unhappy situations as matter for laughter is a recurring motif in Beckett's novels as well as in his plays. In Watt (1953), several kinds of laughter are analysed, but 'the laugh of laughs, the risus purus' is the one that has its source in 'that which is unhappy'. IRISH ECHOES Beckett's propensity for macabre and grotesque humour, his intimate knowledge of the territory that lies on the black border of comedy, to gether with his irreverent treatment of the most sacred traditions and values of mankind, all suggest a strong Swiftean influence to more than one critic. Vivian Mercier, in his book The Irish Comic Tradition, looks at &amp;ckett's work, along with that of Swift, Joyce, Yeats and Synge, against a far more comprehensive background, and suggests that neither he nor any other Anglo-Irish poet, dramatist, novelist or satirist can be fully understood or appreciated without some knowledge of the Gaelic literary heritage. The tradition in which Mercier places all the major Anglo-Irish writers from Swift's day to our own is one which, he believes, can be traced from the very beginnings of Gaelic literature. There is, however, no suggestion that the continuity of Swift, Beckett or any of the others with the Gaelic tradition is necessarily the result of deliberate imitation. As Mercier sees it, 'We have the peculiar case here of an Anglo-Irishman who, like Swift, seems to fit comfortably into the Gaelic tradition, yet has almost no STUDIES Summer 1969 166</page><page sequence="2">conscious awareness of what that tradition is. Beckett might be described as in the Gaelic tradition but not of -ie.' Mercier does succeed in relating, though perhaps rather tenuously, various features of Beckett's novels and plays to some distinctive qualities in Gaelic humorous writers: their fondness for the grotesque and the macabre, their indulgence in fantasy and verbal wit, their talent for ridicule and anti-climax. These qualities are shared by Swift and Joyce. One trait that Swift may well have inherited from his Gaelic predecessors is his tendency to regard no aspect of life as too sacred to be beyond the pale of mockery. In his Vision of 7udgement he makes the Deity the mouthpiece of his own contempt for the human race. But in his scornful derision of things sacred Beckett goes much further than Swift or the Gaelic satirists, or, for that matter, even than Joyce. 'How', asks Winnie in Happy Days, 'can one better magnify the Almighty than by sniggering with him at his little jokes, particularly the poorer ones?' 'What but an imperfect sense of humour', a character en quires in Murphy, 'could have made such a mess of chaos?' The title of All That Fall, a play for radio, is derived from the scriptural text, 'The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down'. The exiguous plot deals with the fate of a little girl who falls or is pushed from a train and meets her death under the wheels. Whether or not it is profitable to see Beckett's work as belonging to the mainstream of the Irish tradition, it is certainly appropriate to place as a novelist, in the company of the 'satirists, black humorists, and learned wits'-Rabelais, Swift, Fielding, Sterne and Joyce.' Time and again like them he parodies learned arguments, takes audacious liberties with learned ideas and makes comic use of esoteric information. One of his favourite devices, to which Rabelais and Swift were also notably addicted, is the use, even in the plays, of long catalogues of oddly assorted objects for comic purposes7Lucky's amazing speech in Godot owes much of its effect to this technique of exhaustive enumeration. While Beckett's novels clearly owe a good deal to Joyce and Proust-he devoted some critical commentary to both of them-he is much more restrained and sober an artist than the former, indulging far less in pedantic excess and exuberant verbalism, and at the same time abandoning both dialogue and the narrative form. Behind his almost classical control and discipline one can sense the influence of Swift, whose most characteristic mode of irony, the adoption of a calm, detached, almost dispassionate tone to convey the most unspeakable horrors, Beckett also makes his own. In Watt, Kate Lynch 'is covered all over with running sores of an unidentifiable nature, but otherwise fit and well'. In All That Fall Mrs Rooney remembers attend ing a lecture given by a psychiatrist, who told the story of a little girl, Summer 1969 STUDIES 167</page><page sequence="3">very strange and unhappy in her ways, and how he treated her unsuccess fully over a period of years and was finally obliged to give up the case. He could find nothing wrong with her, he said. The only thing wrong with her as far as he could see was that she was dying. And she did in fact die, shortly after he washed his hands of her. Reading the numerous examples of this kind of thing in Beckett, one is inevitably reminded of Swift: 'Last week I saw a woman flayed, and you will hardly believe how much it altered her person for the worse.' At times, the debt to Swift is even more specific. In Molloy, the central figure gets into communication with his abstracted mother by knocking at her skull. 'One knock meant yes, two no, three I don't know, four 600ey, five good bye.' This unusual procedure evidently owes something to a Laputan custom described in some detail by Swift in Book III of Gulliver's Travels. Finally, Beckett and Swift have in com600 an obsession with filth and human deformity; Beckett's novels are even more densely packed than any of Swift's satires in prose or verse with images of foulness and vileness. SHAKESPEARE No account of Beckett's debt to the literary past would be complete without some mention of Shakespeare's King Lear. Recent existentialist criticism of this play, particularly that of the Polish critic Jan Kott,' has been largely concerned with making Shakespeare appear as a prophet of the absurd. Kott's basic argument, which he supports by citing a wealth of parallel passages and situations in Lear on the one hand and Godot and Endgame on the other, is that Shakespeare and Beckett have more in com 600 with each other than either has with nineteenth-century drama, whether romantic or naturalistic. Both dramatists, he suggests, have a highly-developed sense of the grotesque, of the great gulf that is fixed between the idea of absolute values and the fragile human order, and in his greatest drama Shakespeare offers I what is essentially a grotesque, rather than a tragic, vision of the world, thus appearing very much our contemporary. In grotesque drama, God is replaced by various kinds of impersonal, hostile and blind mechanisms. The absolute is an absurd automaton. In grotesque, as in tragic drama, ultimate issues are raised: human fate, the meaning of existence, freedom, inevitability. But whereas the downfall of the tragic hero is a confirmation and a recognition of the absolute, the downfall of the grotesque actor, means, as Kott remarks, 'mockery of the absolute and its desecration'. Gods, Nature and destiny are exposed to ridicule. Sketching in the historical background to King Lear, Kott finds that it belongs to a period of great upheaval, marked by STUDIES Summer 1969 168</page><page sequence="4">the disintegration of established values-very much like our own. Because of this, Shakespeare could not appeal to God, Nature or history from the tortures inflicted by the cruel world. As a result, King Lear, like Beckett's plays, makes 'a tragic mockery of all eschatologies : of the heaven promised on earth, and the heaven promised after death; in fact of both Christian and secular theodicies; of cosmogony and of the rational view of history; of the gods and natural goodness.'5 Kott chooses Gloucester's suicide attempt to establish a fundamental relationship between Shakespeare's art in King Lear and the techniques of the Beckettian theatre. Although Gloucester's situation is tragic it is, like similar situations in the plays of Beckett, shown in pantomime, through clowning. Edgar and Gloucester can be made to appear remarkably like prototypes of Beckett's Estragon and Vladimir in Godot. They, like Gloucester, make their futile suicide attempts, and Gloucester's attempt, like theirs, is framed in grotesque terms. It is, in Kott's view, a tragic act transmuted by Shakespeare into farce. But most Shakespearians would probably feel that in his anxiety to enlist Shakespeare in the ranks of the existentialists, Kott has radically misapprehended the essentially tragic quality of the Lear universe. Shakespeare's world, whatever may be thought of Beckett's, is one which does take for granted the existence of supernatural powers, moral absolutes and laws of nature to which the actions of men may be opposed, often at the price of terrible suffering and sacrifice. It is a world in which hubris must be punished, in which man's lot is terrible rather than ridiculous. And the note on which Lear is re solved has little in com600 with the bleak despair of the close of Endgame. It is true that the dominant impression at the end of Lear is one of extreme suffering, but Shakespeare has not abandoned us to despair.' What Kott's study de600strates is not that Shakespeare was a late Renaissance harbinger of Beckett, but that the latter was stimulated by several incidents, situations and speeches in King Lear. Shakespeare's fool, like Beckett's tramps, regards profoundly tragic circumstances as matter for a joke. In Lear, as in all of Beckett's plays, we find tragedy frequently interspersed with grotesque humour. In Act I of Godot the arrogant Pozzo leads his starving servant Lucky on a rope. When they reappear in Act II Pozzo is blind and Lucky is dumb. Readers of Lear will naturally be re minded of Edgar leading the blinded Gloucester, and the latter's comment to an old man as Edgar is about to lead him away: 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.' (IV, i, 46. The pronouncements of the blind Hamm from his wheelchair in Endgame are in some ways reminiscent of Lear's after his abdication. Hamm, although powerless, still wants to remain master, and is constantly giving orders and directions to Cloy. In Summer 1969 STUDIES 169</page><page sequence="5">one London production of Endgame, the wheelchair was made to suggest a throne and Hamm was dressed in a faded purple gown. Like Lear, he was a degraded and powerless tyrant. After his abortive suicide attempt, duplicated in Act Without Words as well as in Godot, Gloucester talks with the distracted Lear. In Godot, Vladimir and Estragon carry on a very similar conversation, as a background to which the fallen Pozzo, like Lear another 'ruin'd piece of nature', writhes, groans and beats the ground with his fists. Even small details in Godot are suggestive of Lear. In the latter, for example, the old king orders that his boots be taken off. At the beginning of Godot Estragon is deeply preoccupied with the selfsame task. There are, too, some similarities of phrase and idea in the two plays which can hardly be accidental. 'We have time to grow old. The air is full of our cries,' says Vladimir. Pozzo is furious when Vladimir asks him when Lucky became dumb: 'One day, is that not enough for you, one day like any other day, one day he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we'll go deaf, one day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for you [Calmer They gave birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more.' Lear in his madness sees the lot of man in similar terms: we came crying hither. Thou knowst the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools. (IV, vi, 179-84. THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD In spirit and technique, and in the attitudes towards man's plight which they seem to imply, Beckett's plays have numerous features in com600 with the writings of that group of dramatists and novelists classified some what arbitrarily by critics as the School of the Absurd: Camus, lonesco, Adamov, Pinter and Genet. The influence and example of Sartre are also frequently invoked, and existentialist slogans used to sum up Beckett's basic themes. By now, these slogans have become clichds. The terminology of 'the absurd' has likewise become overworked. For these reasons, and because Beckett is essentially an individualist, not fully committed to the doctrines of any particular school or movement, one hesitates to label his work. Despite all this, it cannot be denied that he has important affinities with each of the writers already mentioned, and that he has been influenced by many of the same general attitudes as they express. Most of the basic ideas found in the writings com600ly classified as absurd or grotesque are STUDIES Summer 1969 170</page><page sequence="6">clearly set forth in the novels of Albert Camus. The locus classicus is, per haps, Le Mythe de Sisyphe (1942). Here we have the famous declaration: 'The world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of the irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart." The word 'absurd' literally means 'out of har600y'. To a greater or lesser extent all the dramatists and novelists of the absurd, as well as Beckett, are conscious of an impassable abyss between the mind that desires and the world that disappoints. Man is seen by them as an alien in a universe that is proffigate and disgusting; once he discovers what it means to exist in such a world he can feel only dread and nausea. He experiences a sense of nothingness, a loss of identity. Existence has no ultimate purpose or significance; it is de trop. God is dead or absent. 'The sun shone, having no alternative, on nothing new,' is the opening sentence of Murphy. The spirit that informs Beckett's work-although here Godot stands somewhere apart-is a grimly pessimistic one. The general picture of man's lot in the universe is as bleak and dreary as that offered by any of the existentialists. The flashes of humour that light it up from time to time serve only to intensify the settled sense of gloom and doom. In the plays, imagery and symbolism contribute powerfully to the general effect. The 'slow burial that begins with birth', a recurring Beckettian theme, is en acted before our very eyes in Happy Days as the 'old extinguisher' the Earth steadily drags the central character down, until only her head is visible as the curtain falls. The dominant image in All That Fall is one of rotting leaves in a ditch. Associated with it are images of dust, dung, broken equipment, disease and death. Life itself is a long sickness. Mr Rooney has often felt the desire to kill a child, 'to nip some young doom in the bud,' as he puts it. 'It is suicide to be abroad,' says Mrs Rooney. 'But what is it to be at home?', she asks Mr Tyler. The answer: 'A lingering dissolution.' She becomes most eloquent, as, indeed, do many of Beckett's characters, at the thought of passing the rest of her days free at least from the horrors of physical and mental suffering which never cease to trouble the inhabitants of Beckett's world. His work as a whole is re markable for the number of maimed, diseased, tortured and crippled derelicts with which it confronts us. Normal, sane and healthy forms of life and attitudes are beyond its scope. In All That Fall, apart from the barely 'half alive' Mrs Rooney and her blind husband, 'alive and twitching', we have Mrs Tully, whose husband is 'in constant pain and beats her unmercifully', and Mr Slocum, whose great concern is to keep his ailing mother out of pain. Even the horse gazes at Mrs Rooney with 'great moist cleg-tormented eyes'. In Godot Estragon has spent the night in a ditch Summer 1969 STUDIES 17</page><page sequence="7">having been attacked and beaten by 'the same lot as usual'. Pozzo is blind and Lucky is dumb. In Endgame, 'the whole place stinks of corpses'. Hamm, his legless parents and Cloy live in a shelter, apparently the last survivors in a desolate world on the brink of extinction. Hamm is unable to stand while Cloy cannot sit. Beyond their present abode is what Hamm calls 'the other hell', a phrase which calls to mind Sartre's treatment of a some what similar theme in Huis Cbs. Hamm's great dream is of a world 'where all would be silent and still, and each thing in its last place, under the last dust'. He keeps asking for his pain-killer; he is quite content to watch his parents die, and becomes wildly agitated at the news that Cloy has found a rat and flea. These must, he decides, be exterminated lest the evolu tionary process should start all over again. For such characters as these there is no ray of hope, nothing to make life endurable. Hamm asks Cloy to look into the dustbin where his father lives. Hamm: What's he doing [cLoy raises lid of Nagg's bin, stoops, looks into it. Pause. Cloy: He's crying. [He closes the lid, straightens up. Hamm: Then he's living. [Pause Did you ever have an instant of hap piness Cloy: Not to my knowledge. As in the plays, so in the novels. The central figure of Malone Dies (1951 lies in filth awaiting death. He misses 'not being able to crawl around any more'. Moran, like Mrs Rooney, contemplates with delight 'the advantages of a local and painless paralysis'. Molloy, like Estragon, has suffered violence at the hands of others: 'I have gone in fear all my life, in fear of blows. Insults, abuse, these I can easily bear, but I could never get used to blows. Even spits still pain me.' Beckett's picture of human suffering and of the degradation to which men can sink has its counterpart in the work of Camus. Some passages in the latter's brilliant 600ologue La Chute (1956), carry hauntingly familiar associations for readers of Beckett: Ended the glorious life, but ended also the frenzy and the convulsions. I had to submit and admit my guilt. I had to live in the little-ease. To be sure, you are not familiar with that dungeon cell that was called the little ease in the Middle Ages. More often than not, one was forgotten there for life. That cell was distinguished from others by its ingenious dimensions. It was not high enough to stand up in nor yet wide enough to lie down in. One had to take on an awkward manner and live on the diagonal; sleep was a collapse and waking a squatting... STUDIES Summer 1969 172</page><page sequence="8">Have you at least heard of the spitting-cell, which a race of people recently thought up to prove itself the greatest on earth A walled-up box in which the prisoner can stand without moving. The solid door that locks him in his cement shell stops at chin-level. Hence only his face is visible, and every passing jailer spits copiously on it. The prisoner, wedged into his cell, cannot wipe his face, though he is allowed, it is true, to close his eyes.' Beckett's work, then, has significant points of contact with a great range of diverse literary and intellectual traditions from Shakespearian drama to the theatre of the absurd; with Gaelic satirists and parodists, with Rabelais, Swift and Joyce. As a novelist, he has affinities with Proust. In an essay on the latter he pays tribute to him for having broken with estab lished scientific and logical modes of observing the phenomenal world; his own aim, like Proust's, is 'a non-logical statement of phenomena in the order and exactitude of their per300tion, before they have been distorted into intelligibility in order to be forced into a chain of cause and effect'. If we are particularly interested in 'movements' and 'schools', we may associate Beckett's dramatic work with a growing reaction in French literature in the nineteen-fifties against abstract systems and doctrinaire involvement, a reaction expressed in the avant-garde theatre of lonesco and Adaxnov, as well as in much novel-writing of the period. Again, various theories have been proposed to account for Beckett's use of grotesque clowning, farce and mime to express what one critic has called 'a view of life as grimly deter ministic as any Greek's'. The com600est explanation invites us to con sider the steady erosion of the tragic sense in 'serious' post-war drama, whose heroes are no longer destroyed by uncontrollable cosmic forces. As Kenneth Tynan puts it, 'the assumption that man is capable of moulding his own destiny has become the idce rebue of modern drama. Radical social reforms are inimical to tragedy and the tragic sense, since they offer alter natives to defeat. Comedy, meanwhile, has occupied the territory that tragedy has vacated." This is Beckett's kind of comedy, but in a play such as Endgame and in the Act Without Words that forms its epilogue, the vision is so cynical and hopeless that the final effect is far more appalling than in many a straightforward tragedy. Finally, if we are looking for a frame of reference for Beckett's progressive abandonment of language in drama, we may find some satisfaction in the suggestion recently put for ward" that the horrors of the contemporary world are so literally unspeak able that language must inevitably fail to express them adequately. All that then remains for the dramatist is to do what Beckett has done in Play: people his stage with characters whose efforts to convey their sense of the grim reality are pathetic and incoherent. But in Murphy there is a sentence which Summer 1969 STUDIES '73</page><page sequence="9">might seem to offer another explanation for the drama of virtual silence, one that is engagingly simple, unphilosophical and persuasive. 'Once a certain degree of insight has been reached,' said Wylie, 'all men talk, when talk they must, the same tripe'. The numerous elements that Beckett's plays and novels hay in com600 should not be allowed to obscure certain important differences. For one thing, Godot, the greatest and most universal of the plays, is full of an explicitly Christian symbolism that we do not find in the novels, while Endgame also has Christian overtones. What emerges for most readers from Beckett's novels is a sense of blank, unmitigated despair. A600g the plays, Godot, at any rate, hardly conveys such a mood. It is a profoundly disturbing work, but intelligent critics have felt able to discuss its total effect in terms of religious hope, and even to describe it as a compelling evocation of the Christian sense of dereliction. In this matter there is no appeal to external evide?ice. Beckett himself has maintained a characteristic reticence about his meanings and intentions, and such novels as Molloy, Malone Dies and Watt, although they belong to the same period of com position as Godot, offer few helpful indications. UNDERSTANDING Godot Anyone who advances a 'serious' interpretation of this play must be pre pared to face the possibility that there is really nothing very profound to interpret, that Godot is no more than a brilliant theatrical tour de force about nothing in particular or, if we must talk about subject-matter, about waiting, passing the time or boredom. Such a reading may well be valid. On the other hand, there are strong indications that there are deeper levels of significance than this in the play, whatever we think may have been the dramatist's conscious intention. Here, of course, it must be borne in mind that this intention, even if we were in a position to know much more than we do about it, is not necessarily the only guide to interpretation. A re viewer of the first edition in The Times Literary Supplement rightly argued that with a play even more than a poem, we have to consider 'not what the author, in a conversation, might say he believed about "life"-but the whole complex significance, the valid levels of meaning, of a coherent structure'. The same reviewer hazarded a generalized statement of the theme of Godot, describing it as 'a prolonged and sustained metaphor about the nature of human life'. But even if we agree that this play is concerned in a funda mental way with the exploration of ultimate issues, there are obviously many different ways in which a work of art may comment on so comprehensive a subject as 'the nature of human life'. The critic concerned to show that Godot deals with human experience STUDIES Summer 1969 174</page><page sequence="10">in a way that can best be apprehended by constant reference to traditional Christian thought starts with one distinct advantage. The basic imagery of the play is Christian, while direct references and allusions to the Christian story are both numerous and recurrent. By the roadside stands a tree near which the two tramps Vladimir and Estragon wait for the mysterious Godot. It is, we are told, a willow. With the progress of the play it acquires various symbolic meanings, all of them obviously Christian. With the tree as the only object visible in the background, Vladimir discusses the fate of the two thieves on Calvary. 'How is it', he wonders, 'that of the four evangelists only one speaks of a thief being saved?' Whether or not we temporarily identify Beckett's two tramps with the two thieves, and interpret Vladimir's genuine interest in their history as a reflection of his concern for his own and Estragon's salvation, it is clear that at this point in the play we are meant to see the tree as a symbol of Christ's cross. At the opening of Act II, we learn that the tree has sprouted four or five leaves, recalling the Tree of Life in Genesis. Midway through the act, terrified at the thought of facing Godot, whose approach Vladimir triumphantly announces, Estragon goes and crouches behind the tree, 'realizes he is not hidden, comes out from behind the tree'. Again, we are inevitably reminded of Genesis: 'And now they heard the voice of the Lord God, as he walked in the garden in the cool of the evening; whereupon Adam and his wife hid themselves in the garden a600g the trees. And the Lord God called to Adam; Where art thou he asked. I heard thy voice, Adam said, in the garden, and I was afraid, because of my nakedness, so I hid myself.' (Gen. III, 8-to). It is Estragon, we realize, who, when Pozzo asks him his name in Act I, replies 'Adam', and who suggests to Vladimir that they hang themselves. Towards the beginning of the play we have this intriguing exchange: Vladimir: One of the thieves was saved. [Pause It's a reasonable per centage. [Pause]. Gogo. Estragon: What Vladimir: Suppose we repented Estragon: Repented what Vladimir: Oh. . . [He reflects We wouldn't have to go into the details. And at the end, as they stand under the tree, Estragon with the cord in his hand, and prepare to hang themselves, we think of the story of Judas. The tree, a central symbol of the play, is only one of the many elements drawn by Beckett from the Christian tradition. The desert, the palm-tree, its shadow and the water in Act Without Words also have Biblical over tones. The nature and identity of Godot are, of course, central to any Summer 1969 STUDIES '75</page><page sequence="11">interpretation of the whole. Though he never appears he is constantly being mentioned; his mysterious shadow hovers over the landscape of the play. One theory concerning the origin of Beckett's tide is that it was suggested to him by Clifford Odets's Wiiting for Lefty (1935), a play about a tradeunion leader who fails to turn up at a meeting during a taxi strike because he has been murdered. It is, perhaps, rather too fanciful to press the analogies between the two plays to the limit, and to suggest that Godot (or God does not appear because he, like Lefty, no longer exists, one of Beckett's purposes being to dramatize the Nietzschean 'death of God'. There is, at any rate, sufficient evidence in the imagery and in direct refer ence to justify the assumption that Godot stands for an anthropomorphic image of God. Lucky talks of the existence of a personal God 'with a white beard'. When the boy, Godot's messenger, finally arrives with news that his master will not come until the morrow, he is questioned for the second time about Godot's activities and appearance. His reply, in the light of Lucky's reference, seems to confirm that the one for whom Vladimir and Estragon wait 'in fear and trembling', who would punish those who 'dropped him', is, indeed, an image of God. Vladimir's evident agitation, and particularly his final comment, powerfully reinforce this impression: Vladimir: Has he a beard, Mr Godot Boy: Yes, sir. Vladimir: Fair . . . or [he hestitates or black Boy: I think it's white, sir. [Silence Vladimir: Christ have mercy on us If Godot is meant to symbolize God, the boy he sends on his errands can be seen as an angel. In fact, it seems that Godot sends two different messengers, both looking exactly alike, since the one who comes at the end of Act II tells Vladimir that it wasn't he who came on the previous day. The treatment by the master of his messengers, and the tasks assigned to each, recall various passages in the New Testament. The boy who appears in Act I announces that he works for Godot and minds the goats, while his brother minds the sheep. Godot treats him well, but beats his brother. At least two scriptural texts are pertinent. One underlines the significance of Godot's separation of sheep from goats: 'And all nations will be gathered in his presence, where he will divide men one from the other, as the shepherd divides the sheep from the goats; he will set the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.' (Matt. XXV, 32-3 The other suggests why the one who guards the sheep-the saved souls-is chastised by Godot while the other escapes punishment: 'My son, do not undervalue the correction which the Lord sends thee, do not be unmanned when he reproves thy faults. It STUDIES Summer 1969 176</page><page sequence="12">is where he loves that he bestosscorrection; there is no recognition for any child of his without chastisement.' (Heb. XII, -.6 In Godot, then, Beckett's central themes and images are derived from Christianity. This does not mean that it is necessarily a 'Christian' drama. Its dominant note is not one of joyful expectation that all will ultimately be well. Few concessions are made to optimism. On the other hand, by comparison with the later Endgame, it is not a pessimistic play. The true nature of the relationship between Godot and the ragged tramps-images of fallen man who 'do not move' at the end of each Act because it is not yet time for them to leave the stage which represents the world-is never really established. The expectations of Vladimir and Estragon are doomed to disappointment, nor are we offered any assurance that their patience will have its reward. They will strive to represent 'worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us'; they know that the hours are long while they wait, but they have kept their appointment. For a long time now, it seems to Vladimir, their minds have been 'straying in the night without end of the abysmal depths'. It is, however, precisely this sense of abandonment, emptiness and lonely fear, this consciousness of the with drawal of God's hand, that informs some of the most powerful religious utterances from Job to Hopkins: 'And still I repine bitterly as ever, no groaning too heavy for the wounds I bear. Ah, if I could but find my way to God, reach his very throne, in reproachful accents plead my suit before him.. . . But no, travel I east or west, I find no trace of him, turn I north or south, I have no skill to catch sight of him. And he, all the while, keeps watch over my doings, tests me like gold the fire assays'. (Job XXIII, 2-1 1 Endgame If Godot is Beckett's Purgatorio, Endgame is his Inferno. At the end of one we feel some measure of consolation and hope, even if faint and quali fied; the other leaves us feeling that whatever powers preside over its cheer less and dark universe are careless of man's good or even hostile to it. Here the existentialist view of man's lot comes into its own. 'Use your head,' says Hamm, 'you're on earth, there's no cure for that!' In the epilogue, called Act Without Words, the forces external to man are certainly not indifferent: they are actively hostile and malicious. The single human actor is repeatedly 'flung backwards on the stage'. In a desert beneath a blazing sun a tree and a carafe of water appear suddenly before him, but as he tries to avail of their benefits they are withdrawn from him and disappear. In Endgame Cloy sees himself as the victim of some wicked demiurge with an endless capacity for inflicting suffering : 'I say to myself-sometimes, Cloy, you must learn to suffer better than that if you want them to weary of punishing you.' At Summer 1969 STUDIES '77 6</page><page sequence="13">one point, Hamm proposes that they all pray silently to God. Attitudes of prayer are adopted but soon despairingly abandoned. 'What a hope!' says Cloy. 'Nothing doing!' says Nagg. Hamm concludes by paradoxically curs ing God because 'He doesn't exist'. G. S. Frazer has suggested that Beckett's plays can be called, 'though in a peculiarly desolating way', religious drama, adding that 'perhaps this desolation of the sense of God's absence, or of man's wilful rejection of him, is the only way that religious drama can now exist'." It is certainly true that much of the significance of these plays can best be defined by reference to the Bible, and in particular to the Book of Job, itself a religious drama as much pervaded by feelings of despair and dereliction as anything Beckett has written, though of course resolved on an optimistic note and given a decidedly happy ending. There are times when Beckett's debt to Job is far from being a vague general one; several passages in Endgame and some in Happy Days suggest a more direct influence. Cloy recalls that friends have tried to dispel his doubts by asking him to raise his head to the heavens to 'look at all that beauty, that order'. Eliu used the same argu ment to convince Job. Winnie under 'a hellis sun' in Happy Days is acutely conscious of emptiness, futility and boredom; her life is a struggle to occupy the long, weary hours, 'all day long, between the bell for waking and the bell for sleep'. At times, Job's vision of man's life on earth is as bleak and cheerless as Beckett's: 'Like a hired drudge he passes hi time away; nor ever was slave so weary, longing for the shade, or drudge so weary, waiting to earn his hire, as I have been, counting these 600ths of emptiness, these nights that never brought rest. Lie I down to sleep, I weary to be up with the day; comes the day, I weary for the evening, com fortless until dark.' (Job VII, 2-4 Endgame, like the Book of Job and Lear, is a look at the worst. Although Beckett is not writing from the standpoint of religious belief, and although his use of Old Testament and Christian materials may be ambiguous and bitterly ironical, he nevertheless succeeds at times in probing far greater depths of religious experience than many a writer who has a frankly Christian message to convey.
