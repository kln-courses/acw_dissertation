<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDEOLOGY OF FORM: PARTIAL SYSTEMS IN LA VIEILLE FILLE Fredric Jameson Whatever else it may mean, the term ideology may be taken as a sign designating the agreement of those who use it on a common field of study or problematics, if not a common solution to the latter's problems: those who consent to pronounce it, or who insist on doing so, may indeed be supposed to share at least a minimal conviction that the forms of consciousness are shaped or at least influenced by their social or historical ground, and that this "determining" relationship is worth studying in its own right. On the other hand, the analyst of ideology ought always to take into account the possibility that, once raised, the concept of ideology may ultimately prove more troublesome than it is worth: in it, indeed, two contradictory tendencies are at war-the one, a promise, held out by the very application of the name itself to so many diverse social phenomena, that it will be possible to elaborate a model of the relationship in question; the other, a pressure from the historical side of the same concept which, by insisting not only on the variations in the nature of ideology from moment to moment within a given social system, but above all on the immense changes in the structure of power from one type of system to anotherl, begins to make us feel that there is something misleading about using the same word for all of them. Nowhere do the antinomies of the concept of ideology manifest themselves more dramatically than in what is practically a locus classicus of such study, the novels of Balzac: socially and politically polyvalent enough to make the construction of an ideological model an exciting task, they ultimately inspire the feeling that they are too exceptional, owing to the unique transitionality of the age which they reflect, to be of any use in understanding the literary and ideological structures of other periods. The ambiguities in Balzac have frequently been rehearsed, generally in an attempt to do away with them in one way or another and thereby to have peace, as the Brechtian character said; but most recently, one has the impression that it is the Left that has won out, and this partly because of the disappearance of the old classical and monarchist Right, and partly because the reigning liberal intellectual establishment (with its ideology of modernism) has been less well able to assimilate Balzac than other, more individualistic or stylized writers of the same period, such as Stendhal or Hugo. So the very choice of Balzac as object of study has come itself to have the value of a sign, and to function a little like a declaration of Marxism (and let the present essay be no exception). Not that the Marxist solution to the "problem" of Balzac is without substance in its own right: on the contrary, the recent Mythes balzaciens of Pierre Barbdris has demonstrated, with an overwhelming fullness of detail, the truth of Lukics' canonical assertion that there is a narrative logic in Balzac's novels which is in direct contradiction to his professed political convictions. Barbdris shows that Balzac's conservatism and royalism can only be considered an "abstract" or "ideal" position-his concrete judgements on the ancien rigime and the historical Restoration Sub-Stance No. 15 29</page><page sequence="2">30 The Ideology of Form being as severe as any passed on the bourgeoisie itself-the abstractness of which alone, however, affords the novelist the distance he needs to register the raw material of his society as a whole, and in that respect this imaginary standpoint enables a "politique du reel" beyond the perceptual capacities of later novelists, more progressive or even realistic though they may have been in their social views. Yet in literature there is a reality of the appearance just as much as an appearance that distorts a more fundamental reality: in the case of Balzac, we cannot completely ignore what he said he was, and what he thought he was, if only for the reason that at certain moments in history, readers believed him. So we tend to forget that the great rediscovery of Balzac in the Third Republic was essentially a conservative operation; just as the discovery of Stendhal by the same people-Taine, the positivists, Bourget-was that of a preeminently aristocratic and anti-bourgeois writer. Bourget's essay on Balzac is eloquent testimony to the fact that there was a time when Balzac's ideas were taken seriously, and when he was thought of as a social and ideological prophet not unlike, say, a Dostoievsky or a Nietzsche in our own time (and with similar results). Even the novels must have looked different: rather like those of Barbey d'Aurevilly, I would imagine, all romance and lost causes with a little whiff of "Blut und Boden" to come. Yet Taine's own study of Balzac suggests something else as well: that the greatness of the novelist was to have been himself the first to make a systematic study of the problem we raised above, namely the relationship of consciousness to its social ground. Is it possible indeed that the ideology of Balzac fascinates us precisely because Balzac was himself fascinated by ideology? I. ANATOMY OF A PHYSIOLOGIE The ambiguity of the term "code" becomes manifest when, deciding whether to use it in the singular or the plural, you suddenly realize that these alternatives designate two very different types of communication. In an everyday interpersonal situation, for instance, it would be misleading to speak about "codes", for the good reason that if more than one are involved, the message itself will only be imperfectly transmitted: your code, in other words, is Morse, or English, or deaf-and-dumb, but the whole point of the operation is to use but one at a time, and to make sure that your opposite number is aware which one it is. And clearly enough, this literal use of the concept of the code, in the singular, will not be very suggestive for literary analysis. But literature is precisely not an instance of direct face-to-face communication: on the contrary, it is something like deferred or mediated communication in which certain of the Jakobsonian "factors"2 (the addresser, for example, or the context) have been suppressed, those factors then being replaced by a relatively unnatural and artifical compensatory reenforcement of some of the remaining ones. (The other historical development which must be held accountable for the new pluralization of the phenomenon of the linguistic code is, of course, the emergence of a secular society itself, in which the hegemony of a single overall code-what we call religion-has been</page><page sequence="3">Fredric Jameson 31 broken and given way to a host of private languages, codes agreed upon only by small sub-groups within the new Gesellschaft.) Under these circumstances, it may become interesting to speak in terms of codes in the plural, provided we understand the consequences that spring from this new and extra-linguistic, relatively metaphorical use of the word. For one thing, our subject will then always implicitly or explicitly be that of an inconsistency or a contradiction between one or more of the codes in question: for if there were not so much as a latent incompatibility between two or more of our plural codes, there would clearly be no need to ascribe independent existence to them, and the one would automatically fall into place as a simple sub-group of the other. Then too, I think that as a methodological fact of life we will find that as our attention to the plurality of codes increases, along with our emphasis on their mutual contradictions, our awareness of the correlated factor of the message will decrease proportionately. But how can one speak meaningfully of a code, even in the plural, without taking into account the message or messages which it was designed to transmit? The tendency, I am afraid, will be towards some MacLuhanite resolution, in which it is the codes themselves, or rather their contradiction, which become the message, a formula that seems to me to raise more problems than it solves. We are thus led to ask ourselves whether the conflicts between the various codes at work in a given literary text are to be understood as virtual only, or whether, indeed, we can isolate certain key moments in which those conflicts become actualized, moments in which the foregrounding of some kind of interference between the various literary codes then momentarily constitutes something like a narrative event in its own right. For ordinarily, surely, the codes of a given narrative function in a relatively secondary and semantic way, and their study is little more than a kind of object- or value-oriented lexicology. This is to say that for the most part such codes are called upon to furnish the raw material of what are termed the "indices" of a given text: thus, the drumming of the fingers, in one cultural code a graphic shorthand for impatience, might in some wholly different one function as the sign of some dawning musical reverie, if not simply a way of getting your waiter's attention. The principal interest of such a lexicology of codes will then lie in the realm of comparative culture. Yet there are other moments, in certain narrative forms, in which codes are foregrounded in such a way as to suggest what the Hegelians would call a virtual coming to consciousness of their existence and functioning in and for itself: such, for instance, are those long descriptive passages in Balzac, from which-portrait or interior-the characters and their acts recede, and in which the properties of a given object-a human being, or a house, or a particular district in a city-come to lead something like an autonomous narrative life of their own, thereby at the same time making themselves accessible to the watchful reader in the form of so many organized codes or systems which are perhaps-in the fragmentary and secular context of the modern middle-class world-not without their similarity to those primitive classification schemes described by Levi-Strauss in his study of archaic thought or pensde sauvage. The opening section of La Vieille Fille, the portrait of the Chevalier de Valois, a bravura piece which for wit and high spirits, and a manic and irrepressible volubility</page><page sequence="4">32 The Ideology of Form has no equal anywhere else in Balzac, may serve as a useful illustration of this process. It falls into three main sections, each of which reveals the Chevalier through the lens of a different topic, showing him now in his social deportment, now in terms of gallantry, now finally as he struggles with his own penury and invents ingenious strategems to make ends meet in some less than humiliating manner. These three groups of data about the Chevalier we will characterize as so many different codes, and the interest of the portrait will then lie in the relationship of the three codes to one another and the manner in which their alternation may be said to constitute something like a protonarrative in its own right, one which presumably, in something more fundamental than the simple establishment of the necessary preliminary information, sets the stage for the narrative proper which follows. The first code, that of manners, might no doubt itself be resolved into a host of sub-codes such as that of clothing, storytelling, table manners, personal hygiene, and the like. For the moment it is enough to observe that this particular code is organized around a historical-or rather, more properly, a generational-opposition between the manners of the ancien rigime and of the authentic pre-revolutionary nobility, and those, henceforth secularized and bourgeois, of the imperfectly named Restoration itself. The Chevalier, as a kind of complete social microcosm in his own right, is something like a sign in which the two regimes mingle in unstable temporal coexistence: withness his "costume de transition qui unissait deux siecles l'un a l'autre"3, a compromise which shows a good deal more realism than the intransigeant loyalty to the past of the mummified inhabitants of the companion Cabinet des antiques, but which nonetheless shares at least some of the absurdity of Scott's Knockdunder, who, uniting a Highlands outfit with the "fierce cocked hat deeply guarded with gold lace" of the civilized Lowlands, looks, "as someone said who had seen the executions of the insurgent prisoners in 1715 ... as if some Jacobite enchanter, having recalled the sufferers to life, had clapped in his haste, an Englishman's head on a Highlander's body."4 Yet the justaposition with Scott and the national oppositions at work in the latter suggest that Balzac's sequence of historical moments must also be ultimately rooted in the more basic sociological reality of a synchronic opposition, although in his case the polarization is not that of social forms (the barbaric Highlanders versus the civilized Lowlanders or Sassenachs), but rather that-henceforth determinant in the post-revolutionary countries-of social class. For obviously, what is meant but what is not said, is that the Chevalier's attire combines modern bourgeois features ("habit marron a boutons dores ... culotte a demi juste en pout-de-soie et A boucles d'or .. gilet blanc sans broderie," (212)) with vestiges of the old aristocratic finery in the form of the "cravate serree sans col de chemise", the "boucles d'or carrees" of his shoes, and not least the "deux chaines de montre qui pendaient parallelement de chacun de ses goussets" (212-213) and which echo the "deux petites boucles representant des tites de negre en diamants" (211) in the lobes of his ears. The point is, however, that the class content of this particular code, that of the Chevalier's clothing, is systematically underplayed: its modern, or Romantic, early-nineteenth-century features are for instance attributed, not to Restoration middle-class fashion, but rather to that "haute elegance anglaise" (212) associated with</page><page sequence="5">Fredric Jameson 33 the British aristocracy and Beau Brummel. For the moment, in other words, Balzac passes that open conflict between aristocrat and bourgeois, which is the deepest subject of his novel, off as an internal inconsistency within the aristocracy itself, whether it be a question of successive generations or a distinction between national styles. We will suggest therefore that at this stage the initial class opposition is for whatever reason repressed, so that at the outset we are not confronted with two terms which define themselves in some stark antagonism to each other, but rather merely two separate and autonomous historical or stylistic phenomena, each of which-that of the ancien regime, and that of the lbstoration-enjoys some plenitude of existence in its own right. Meanwhile, in the course of the articulation of this initial code of manners, we find the account interrupted by considerations of a rather different sort. It is, indeed, as though the logic of the first code, carried to its conclusion, suddenly produced quite a different effect than that initially desired, suggesting the need, if not to call it into question, then at least to establish some new and hitherto unexpected dimension to the portrait under construction. Here is the first discordant note in the account of the Chevalier's appearance: "Seulement, cet Adonis en retraite n'avait rien de male dans son air, et semblait employer le fard de la toilette pour cacher les ruines occasionnees par le service militaire de la galanterie ..." (212) What this reversal suggests is that a positive feature of one code may not turn out to be nearly so desirable in the terms of a different one: thus the very completeness with which the Chevalier is able to embody the spirit of the ancien regime, with all its elegance and sophistication, sets unwanted vibrations going in the wholly different area of sexuality, in which it proves merely to signify effeminacy. The new code, of course, is a system in its own right, and its signals-the "ruines" of the description already quoted, but also the meaning of Du Bousquier's gaze, "fin comme celui de M. de Talleyrand, mais un peu iteint" (226)-ultimately derive from a whole metaphysic of energy-expense and longevity the monument to which is of course La Peau de chagrin, but which draws its social value from the deepest superstitions about the effects of sexual activity, and seems, indeed, in this relatively systematic form, to have been Balzac's legacy from his father.5 Yet this semantic value of the sexual code, the content it is able to supply to the various narrative "indices", is overshadowed by its demarcation from the preceding one, and from the heightened antitheses at work in the new context. At this point then the fundamental conflict in the novel-systematically concealed by the code of manners-seems much closer to making its appearance on the very surface of the text: the new code creates a situation in which contradiction seems unavoidable, what is positive in the first code (elegance) proving negative in the second (effeminacy). And indeed at a later stage in the narrative, the Chevalier's rival, Du Bousquier, will step into the empty slot which has been waiting for him in this new opposition, and lend it all to the substance of his Herculean physique, so fascinating, in spite of herself, to Mile. Cormon: "de moyenne taille, gras comme un foumisseur, faisant parade de ses mollets de procureur 6grillard.... Ses mains, enrichies de petits bouquets de poils a chaque phalange, offraient la preuve d'une riche musculature par de grosses veines bleues, saillantes. Enfin, il avait le poitrail de l'Hercule-Farnise, et des Cpaules i</page><page sequence="6">34 The Ideology of Form soutenir la rente." (226) The mocking clink of the metaphor of opulence, however, reminds us that by the time we reach this second portrait the sexual code has already proved somewhat inadequate, at least as far as Du Bousquier is concerned. The shift from one code to another does not, however, involve a complete abandonment of the earlier data; rather, the continuity between the two sections, between the account of the Chevalier's behavior in society and those euphemisms (transparent for Balzac's audience) which supply the appropriate sexual information, is preserved by the persistence of certain common features of both descriptions, features which are then reorganized into what, following Tynianov or Althusser, we might call new hierarchies of dominance and subordination. Take for example the Chevalier's nose ("au nombre des propribt6s du chevalier, il faut compter le nez prodigieux dont I'avait dou6 la Nature. Ce nez partageait vigoureusement une figure pale en deux sections qui semblaient ne pas se connaitre et dont une seule rougissait pendant le travail de la digestion," etc.,210), a relatively secondary feature of the first section of the portrait, which, metonymically proving him, if not wholly worthy of his name, then at least emblematically akin to the dynastic spirit of the Bourbons as well as their predecessors, at best strikes a faintly discordant note in the general roll-call of his physical graces (blond, slender, youthful, and so forth). Yet when this same nose reappears in an overtly sexual context, from subordinate and negative it becomes at once the "fundamental signifying trait" in terms of which all the rest are interpreted: "Le chevalier avait la voix de son nez, son organe vous eft surpris par des sons amples et redondants" (212). The symbolism of the Chevalier's nose, which the new context makes it impossible to overlook, derives of course from the oldest sexual folklore of the human race, and thus-to anticipate a methodological concept to which we will retumrn in the second part of this essay-functions as much as a connotation of the narrator's social role itself (identification with some "genuinely" national and no doubt imaginary peasant background and culture), as it does as a sign in its own right. Yet at the same time the revaluation of this sign system throws the whole message of the portrait into some confusion. The new sexual code had allowed us to glimpse, for the first time, some genuine opposition in the antithesis of the blond and ageing Adonis of the salons of the ancien rigime to the robust Farnese Hercules of the Directory, seen now as something like an athletic champion of the rising industrial bourgeoisie. Yet the Chevalier's nose is there to remind us pointedly that this antithesis will prove itself to be a misleading and indeed erroneous one: the real opposition subsequently turning out to be, not that between elegance but effeminacy on the one hand, and crude and muscular energy on the other, but rather simply that which holds between sexuality and outright impotence. At this point, then, we begin to understand that the inconsistency between the two basic codes of the portrait, that of manners and that of sexuality, raises the even more fundamental problem of their mutual adequacy in accounting for reality itself: thus our attention shifts from the object being coded (the Chevalier) to the very nature of the picture of reality suggested by the codes themselves, and the contradiction between them-better still, the antinomy to which they give rise-is not without its analogies to those basic contradictions which according to Levi-Strauss it was the function of the mythic</page><page sequence="7">Fredric Jameson 35 narrative to resolve in the first place, contradictions to which we may equally well apply his striking formulation of the content of ritual: "Ce qu'en d6finitive le rituel cherche i surmonter, n'est pas la r6sistance du monde g l'homme mais la resistance, a l'homme, de sa pensde."6 In these terms, we may suggest that the subsequent narrative may be seen as an attempt not merely to answer the basic question: How is it possible for the graceful, effeminate, elderly Chevalier to be more potent than the rough-and-ready bourgeois banker Du Bousquier? but also and above all, by so doing, to resolve the ultimate social contradictions (aristocracy versus bourgeoisie) of which the incompatibility of the two codes is something like a symptom. Yet the final ironic twist of the description of Du Bousquier's physique ("des 6paules g soutenir la rents") reminds us that we have not yet come to terms with the code in which the third and final section of the Chevalier's portrait is expressed, namely that of money itself. At this point, also, we must evaluate a formal pattern of the micro-narrative which becomes more and more insistent in the final section, even though it is present in the very first words of the novel (who is the so-called Chevalier de Valois, really? ), and this is, of course, the indication of the presence of a secret and the rhetorical organization of the reader's anticipations around the breathless promise of a revelation to come. This anecdotal structure (Enigma/Revelation) is something like an empty form which in principle ought to be serviceable in the articulation of any code;7 yet in practice, for reasons yet to be determined, it would seem to enter- tain a privileged relationship with the final account of the Chevalier's finances, where as in a kind of preview of the narrative proper, Balzac organizes a bewildering and vir- tually Proustian series of reversals around the termini of Mystery/Solution and Appearance/Reality, and the progressive generation, at each step, of some wholly unexpected result which serves to perpetuate the process on a higher plane. Thus, the fact is that the Chevalier (whoever he is, secret) is wholly destitute (secret), having but a modest pension; however (revelation), by allowing everyone to learn this fact, he gets himself invited to dinner every night of the week, thus making ends meet (unexpected denouement). Yet the real point of getting invited out is in reality (secret revealed) to earn money at whist, money which he then (further revelation!) sends himself so as to perpetuate the impression that he is receiving a modest pension which indeed he is not (a revelation which is transformed a posteriori back into a deep secret), etc. The ultimate secret of this otherwise infinite series is that of desire: the Chevalier has the project of marrying Mile. Cormon, and ironically, it is the very success with which this ultimate secret has been kept which ensures the failure of the project: for Mlle. Cormon finally ends up accepting Du Bousquier at least partly because she has failed to detect any signs that the Chevalier, whom in some ways she prefers, is interested in her. Her "stupidity" is thus only too systematically complementary to the Chevalier's deviousness: his secret is as frustrating for her in its own way as is that of Du Bousquier himself. For we must juxtapose this positive secret, of desire, with the latter's negative and indeed wholly physical secret of impotence, symbolized throughout the book by the baldness beneath his wig. Here, indeed, the reader's efforts to discover the key to the mystery is mocked by a curious formal echo-chamber: we think we get the point about Du Bousquier ("il ne pouvait plus &amp;tre qu'ambitieux", 230), but if so, then Suzanne's accusation does not make</page><page sequence="8">36 The Ideology of Form much sense. But when Du Bousquier seems himself in doubt as to whether he might or might not be responsible for the (false) pregnancy, the reader begins to wonder whether he has understood the joke properly in the first place, and indeed, in a very real sense, his own impotence becomes the textual analogon of that of Du Bousquier in the narrative: a secret which is not a presence, not a positive phenomenon, but rather mere absence, frustration, incomprehensibility, and so forth. Not that the Chevalier's secret fares any better, for as so often in Balzac it is as though the truth of desire were associated with unfulfillment-"Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart-a small spark, all the rest on's body cold." And the sudden deterioration of the Chevalier's appearance, the abrupt on-set of genuine old age after the failure of his dynastic hopes, dramatically underscores the deep underground affinity Balzac senses between desire, the timeless eternity of the unconscious, and the month-by-month and year-by-year decline of the human organism through time and history. But the ultimate explanation for the predominance of the rhetorical figure of the secret in this final section of the portrait devoted to money lies in the peculiar and distinctive kind of opposition governed by the latter and inherent in its code. For in terms of money, there can be no genuine opposing term of any real substance: the opposite of having money is simple privation, and the "decent" poverty of the Gransons is simply a half-way house to suicide and not, as the conclusions to books like Illusions perdues might suggest, some positive and honest virtue in its own right. In this light, the successive oppositions generated by the successive codes of the portrait seem to fall into a pattern of increasing negativity but also increasing impoverishment as well: in the code of manners, for instance, it was still possible to be an aristocrat if one was not a bourgeois, to be a bourgeois if one was not an aristocrat: the two terms were felt to be not so much contraditions as rather simple contraries, and even here, as we saw, their mutual exclusiveness was systematically muffled and weakened by the text itself. In the second code, also, that of sexuality, it seemed as though one could either be effeminate or be masculine, and that each mode of being still retained some positive content in its own right. Already here, however, the reader begins to suspect that the antithesis is simpler than this, the mere either/or of sexuality or impotence, and it is this stark alternative of simple affirmation or negation which will become dominant in the operation of the final code of money. Nor does the latter leave the former codes unaffected by its new structure: on the contrary, it may be said that like the money economy itself, the money code operates something like a demystification (Deleuze and Guattari call it a decoding in their terminology8) of the earlier codes, whose illusions are thereby unmasked. These demystifications are, of course, simply the effects of fresh restructurations of the type we have already described in connection with the Chevalier's nose: elements persisting through all three sections here finding yet a third position in yet a third signifying system. So, for instance, the extraordinary whiteness of the Chevalier's linen is in the first section of the portrait clearly enough a sign or index of the elegance with which he moves in social life as in his very element. But this same feature, persisting into the force field of the second, overtly sexual code, now gives off overtones of a somewhat different and much stronger kind: now the "blancheur" extends to the Chevalier's</page><page sequence="9">Fredric Jameson 37 underlinen as well, and is set in opposition, not to the unfashionableness of bourgeois dress in general, but rather specifically to the food-spotted and urine-stained garments of other elderly people, in contrast to which the Chevalier's dazzling cleanliness becomes an explicit sign of youth and of constant preparedness for amorous encounter. From one interchangeable sign among others, therefore, this datum has become dominant (one which is indeed relatively conventionalized in the novels of this and the preceding period). This element now continues to emit signals from well into the third section of the portrait, where however they are once again transformed, this time almost beyond recognition. For what we discover in the third section, dealing with the Chevalier's finances, is something' like an overdetermination of the first two: better still, the readings suggested by the earlier codes were simply wrong, and it turns out that the spotlessness of the Chevalier's linen is neither proof of his elegance nor testimony of his erotic triumphs. On the contrary, there is another, far simpler explanation, which like Occam's razor slices across the earlier two and makes the reader wonder why it never occurred to anyone before: the Chevalier's clothes are as clean as they are for a much more basic reason than any already given, namely that he boards with a laundress! (gros rire, etc.) Thus the new code is not simply another, equivalent one in a long series, but rather comes with a kind of etiological finality, and has the result of effectively discrediting all of the earlier ones and of supplanting them with a new type of thinking about their objects. The illusory richness of the older codes is demystified, and stripped of its capacity to mislead, but at the same time nothing replaces it but the abstract system of financial cause and effect itself: the object's value as a sign or a symbol is here systematically deleted, and we witness something like that passage from quality to quantity which for Marx and Engels, but also for Hegel himself, characterizes the coming into being of capitalism, and the replacement by the market system and its measurable equivalencies of the older qualitative values of pre-capitalist societies. In Capital this process is described in terms of the shift from production based on use value (in which each object is somehow unique, and carries its own properly incomparable charge of libidinal energy) to that on the basis of exchange value, where objects are related through the neutral medium of money itself, which, by rendering them indifferently equivalent, reduces their former qualities to the grey tastelessness of sheer number. But information theory has given us another terminology in which to see this process, which we may then also usefully describe in terms of the passage from analog to digital systems: in the analog machine, indeed, "there is no true zero (at "zero" the machine is "off'). All the quantities involved are positive; there are no minus quantities."9 An analog world (or an analog representation) would thus be, following Wilden's terminology, one of sheer qualitative difference, in which each term-fact or object-knows a kind of autonomy in its own right. Digitalization now replaces that plenitude with a network of simple distinctions or off/on oppositions: its data undergo a kind of rationalization and standardization which reduces the older, relatively dialectical relationships between them to the newer relatively more static type of the binary opposition. From the point of view of information theory, of course, all</page><page sequence="10">38 The Ideology of Form communication is a mixture of these two modes of thought, which may be characterized as the iconic (the analog) and the metalingual (the digital) respectively: but the thrust of the theory seems to me to retain the historical implications of the older Hegelian terminology outlined above, insofar as the "fall" into digitalization is felt to constitute both an advance in man's capacity to control the world and, at ohe and the same time, an impoverishment of the preceding modes of existence. The information model has the additional benefit, in the context of narrative analysis, of directing our attention to other key features of the process of digitalization, namely the appearance of the subject or shifter, the capacity for metalanguage, and the emergence of negation or of the zero. The progression of codes in the Balzacian portrait can now be understood, therefore, as a way of programming the reader for the narrative to come; and the final money or digital code must now be understood in connection with the most fundamental rhythm of Balzacian plot as a whole, whose breath-taking and monotonous alternations must be understood as one gigantic off/on system in which the characters are systematically lifted on the crest of success and just as systematically dashed to the ground again. Indeed, it is in this light that the fundamental problem of Balzac's aesthetic can be understood: how, in a world of simplified digital oppositions, in which the hero can only win or lose, the predictability of these outcomes can be disguised. Balzac must preserve his system of expectations (the semantic content of his heroes' quests being varied along a broad spectrum that runs from money and power and social status through invention, art, "gloire", to sex and love) while systematically sowing false clues and monitory intimations ("ce geste fatal", "comme la suite le montrera", etc.) which can then be contradicted by the immediate results of a given episode, even though they will be confirmed in the long run. There thus comes into being a unique temporal structure-something like a meta-melodrama-in which the reader's most characteristic reactions are neither hope nor fear but rather something like "hope against hope", a negation of some already present temporal perspective, which, as soon as expectation has ratified it in its turn, will be itself the object of some new reversal "beyond all expectations". So it is that the final and most unexpected reversal of all will be that in which both success and failure are cancelled out, in that desolate transcendence of which the conclusion of La Vieille Fille furnishes a triumphant and intolerable realization (married and an old maid all at once!). Balzacian plot is thus profoundly compromised by these rhythms of appetite and acquisition which are only too clearly those of the nascent capitalist system, and it is too easy to suggest-even though it is also true-that Balzac thematizes the new digital and decoded forms, thus making them available to us in a critical way, his own novels furnishing something like a formal commentary on their own content. The trouble is that the reader must find it in himself to share the appetencies that drive the plot along: his very excitement is the sign of his own symbolic participation, and there is no disengaged, ironic position provided for him (as in Flaubert) so that he can survey the narrative without being compromised by it. It is more honest, with Lucien Goldmann,lO to recognize that Balzac is in this respect also unique among the great nineteenth century writers and that to him alone the Lukacsian concept of the</page><page sequence="11">Fredric Jameson 39 "problematic hero" does not apply. His real descendency is not Flaubert or naturalism, but rather the best-seller, with its thinly disguised wish-fulfillments and its cult of success and consumption. The most corrupt of all the great nineteenth century novelists, Balzac is also the most lucid and realistic, because the peculiar elements that make up his form do not only stem from personal choices and psychological attitudes, but also and above all from a unique transitional situation in the history of the novel, and in the development of the novel's raw materials, or in other words, capitalism, as well: and to say so is to recall that Balzac is also anti-capitalist, and that the other side of his ideology functions precisely as an accusation and ajudgement on what we have seen to be the deepest rhythms of Balzacian narrative. II. CHARACTER SYSTEMS AND POLITICAL ALLEGORY But what about point of view? comes the inevitable objection. What about tone, narrative voice, authorial persona, implied or explicit? what about irony? And it is certain that at the level at which our analysis of the Chevalier's portrait takes place, these surface phenomena do not seem particularly relevant: on the other hand, clearly, that admission will itself amount to a declaration of methodological bankruptcy in the eyes of that American academic criticism for which "point of view" is the fetish. I have suggested elsewhere that "point of view" in the novel is itself to be understood as a historical phenomenon, its codification contemporaneous with the fragmentation of middle-class life towards the end of the nineteenth century, and thus the immediate precursor of that whole thematics of subjectivist relativism visible in Conrad and Ford and Pirandello and Gide in a formal experimentation whose ideological content-the reflection of a monadized society-is immediately apparent. But, it will be objected, surely point of view in the generalized sense is a necessary feature of all narratives, which must-whether they are oral and primitive or the most modernistic samples of "6criture"-convey their information from a determinate angle. Two separate implications of point of view theory must, however, here be distinguished: the problem most immediately suggested by this objection is that of the identification of the reader with a given character. But there is also the somewhat different matter of the so-called authorial persona, or in the late nineteenth century the gradual depersonalization of narrative and the elimination of all traces of the old omniscient narrator. The first of these areas we associate with the name of Henry James, the second with that of Flaubert. But to deal with the second of these problems first, it seems important to understand that the depersonalization of narrative which we associate with Flaubert is precisely a negative, rather than a positive phenomenon, and is related to the status of the artist himself and to the disappearance, under capitalism, of some socially sanctioned institution of storytelling in which the activities of both sender and receiver, narrator and public, correspond to roles recognized and codified within the social order itself. In this light the depersonalization of Flaubert may be understood as a symbolic attempt to deny or negate the problem itself, and by doing away with the troublesome reminders of the now problematical artist and his now-problematical</page><page sequence="12">40 The Ideology of Form public, by substituting for them the supreme reality of the work as object, indifferent to creator or public alike, to eliminate the anxiety which its recognition would involve. But in Balzac's works, at a far earlier stage in this development, the writer's strategy is clearly different, and amounts to an attempt, following the lead of Sir Walter Scott, to revive an old pre-capitalist mode of storytelling, to combine elements of the old storyteller of inn or village with those, equally feudal, characteristics of the high-society wit and raconteur. It is in this sense that the most useful critical instrument for dealing with authorial "persona" remains that pre-structuralist concept of connotation developed by Barthes in Mythologies11, a method which allows us to understand the multifunctionality of a text like that of the Chevalier's portrait, which now, in its entirety, becomes a sign of Balzac's social status and of the social sanction he demands for the act of storytelling itself. As for the rather different problem of the identification of the reader with this or that character (and it is this particular problem which gives rise to those two equally problematical notions of a novelistic "hero" and of "irony"), it seems to me that a post-individualistic age is in a better position to understand the difficulties involved in the idea that the reader must identify exclusively with a given character, an idea which itself presupposes that the reader "has" some unified personality or consciousness to use for that purpose. If for identification, we substitute some such concept as that of libidinal investment; if for the idea of taking sides, we substitute some such model as that of play12, in which sometimes we are spectators, sometimes actors, and that in all of the various positions in turn, then perhaps we may begin to glimpse a way of thinking about the whole question of the characters in a narrative which avoids the pitfalls of the ideology of the subject. In any case, in what is in Balzac something like a pre-individualistic narrative, it is clear that the concepts of identification and point of view have not yet become relevant: the Chevalier is obviously grotesque and Balzac's attitude towards him obviously heavily ironic-unfortunately, the opposite is also true and in another sense the Chevalier is the hero of the work, the figure in whom Balzac's own values and wish-fulfillments are the most deeply invested-and this in a discontinuous way which prevents the formation of some homogeneous ironic vision and which suggests that in Balzac value-investment takes place at a different level than that of the individual characters, who are the mere occasions for its expression. Indeed, no analysis of Balzac is satisfactory unless it comes to terms in one way or another with this profound indifference of Balzacian narrative with its "bearers", who are distanced or suppressed with an arbitrariness that is properly meaningless in terms of the ethical criteria of point of view theory: witness the abrupt reversals of such early works as the Maison du Chat-qui-pelote or Ferragus; above all, see those moments in which supposedly autobiographical characters like Lucien manifestly exceed their author's patience and are abandoned to a ruthless derision that has no equal in the defensive self-deprecation of the irony of books like Madame Bovary or the Portrait of the Artist. What such moments suggest is that Balzac's identification is not with the character, but with the situation itself: the latter, indeed, the moment of "first love", of the initial bright conquest of fame, of friendship, or the moment of scientific inspiration or scientific triumph-these empty situations receive the full orchestration of Balzac's</page><page sequence="13">Fredric Jameson 41 sentimentality, but they do not ensure the continuation of that sympathy for the individual character involved. There is at work here a refusal of identification, and of the literary categories through which it operates, a kind of strange anti-Aristotelianism avant la lettre, not without its parallels to Brecht's depersonalized epic theater: only where in the latter, the literary form was or tried to be post-individualistic, here we find ourselves at a moment that precedes the formation of the classic categories of nineteenth century bourgeois individualism, and of its ideology of the subject, categories which in their turn imply a whole psychology and a whole set of literary features as well, of which irony is one. The difference is, of course, that in Balzac these empty situations still spell out a profoundly acquisitive, middle-class myth of human destiny and of life in the world, itself also distanced in Brecht: so that in the former, the function of the refusal of identification would appear to be the very reverse of that intended by epic theater, namely to chastise individual deviations from the bourgeois myth of individual success in order the better to encourage the realization of the latter. Still, to repudiate the categories of point of view and irony and the ideology of the subject to which they correspond commits us to a search for some more adequate structures to replace them, structures which will account for the peculiar relationship between individual character and impersonal evaluation which we have noted as a feature of the process of reading Balzac. As far as the evaluation is concerned, our problem is facilitated by the open didacticism of La Vieille Fille, a humorous object lesson, or wry political sermon, whose complexity or "tension" (in the old New Critical sense) derives from what the Sartre of What is Literature? would have called its happy necessity to reconcile several different and conflicting publics all at once: in the present case, aristocratic/bourgeois, Parisian/provincial, finally even women readers versus those of the masculine persuasion: to each of these groups or sub-groups some special message is being emitted, a clin d'oeil ~ la Legrandin, which must be tactfully placed without interfering with the other messages in course. The overall lesson is fairly clear: the struggle for Mlle. Cormon's hand is meant as the figure, if not of the struggle for France itself, then at least the rivalry for everything that is most deeply and authentically French in the post-revolutionary state, and of which that older provincial bourgeoisie, with its aristocratic features (noblesse de robe) and its wealth and immemorial custom (embodied in the houses and gardens of Alengon), above all the slow eternity of its way of life, is the privileged manifestation. The lesson is then one of tactics: the Chevalier, as the figure of the aristocratic contender for this prize, is both too subtle and too sophisticated to take the drastic steps necessary. In socio-political terms, then, the critique suggests that this particular group or party is still too deeply affiliated with the spirit of the ancien regime to understand the need for the aggressivity and energy that Balzac associates with the Napoleonic era (and which is useful to him archetypally precisely because it is in some sense dissociated from the class significance of either aristocratic or openly bourgeois regimes). The characteristic military imagery of the moment of truth ("ces petits choses d6cident de la fortune des hommes, comme de celle des empires", etc., 303) is a call to the aristocracy to return from out of its self-imposed isolation after</page><page sequence="14">42 The Ideology of Form the July Revolution, and, on the level of the "imaginary" or of personal fantasy, amounts to an insistent suggestion that this class take unto itself a few of those energetic and Napoleonic men of common blood-e.g., Balzac himself, as a royalist candidate for the Chamber,-who can best manage their cause and bring it to ultimate fruition. But the lesson is also a strategic one, an education in ultimate values as well, and here its public is obviously that represented by Mlle. Cormon herself, or in other words that genuine and authentic, mostly provincial, population of French men and women uncorrupted by the new ways, by money or by revolutionary ressentiment: to them, her fate is a horrible object lesson in making the wrong political choice and mistaking appearance for reality. The ironic distance from a character like the Chevalier (articulated in the splendid opening sentence which begins as Marx might have said in the high seriousness of history itself-the revolutionary aftermath-and ends in the low farce of multiple pretenders) has therefore a very precise structural function in this narrative, namely, to control the degree to which we are to read him as "typical", in Lukics' sense, of the aristocracy as a whole; and this problem is related to the allegorical nature of the work itself. Indeed, what allows Balzac to emerge, unscathed, from the outrageously simplified antithesis which is the very source of the narrative is his apparent reversal of the old medieval structure: "Les 6poques d~teignent sur les hommes qui les traversent. Ces deux personnages prouvaient la virite de cet axiome par l'opposition des teintes historiques empreintes dans leurs physionomies, dans leurs discours, dans leurs idles et leurs costomes. L'un, abrupt, inergetique, g manieres larges et saccadbes, I parole brave et rude, noir de ton, de chevelure, de regard, terrible en apparence, impuissant en realiti comme une insurrection, representait bien la R~publique. L'autre, doux et poli, 616gant, soignC, atteignant a son but par les lents mais infaillibles moyens de la diplomatie, fiddle au gott, etait une image de l'ancienne courtisaneiie" (229). What prevents this sudden blurting out of the allegorical content from ruining the narrative is that it is given to us by way of sharpening what we may call the existential level of the conflict. In medieval literature, individual detail and the individual "characters" and their destinies are there to make more vivid the abstract conceptual content which is the "substantificque moelle" of the narrative; here the convention is the other way round, namely, that if Balzac finds himself obliged to have recourse to this ultimate allegorical gloss on his own text it is merely by w~ay of making the concrete anecdote more vivid. So the ultimate interpretive cries that escape the narrator in his enthusiasm ("Enfin la R~publique impuissante l'emportait sur la vaillante Aristocratie et en plein Restauration", 319) is to be read, like Balzac's other battery of signals (the belle-lettristic one, for instance, this scene was like a Dutch portrait! etc.), simply as a way of reenforcing the anecdotal situation itself, which he pretends to despair of conveying to us in all its intensity. Proust's later historical metaphors (Tante Ldonie as Louis XIV) will merely make this structure self-conscious and dispense with the signals for audience emotion (what in Balzac's period is known as the "sublime"). Yet in spite of this structural inversion, by which an appearance of allegory is somehow corrected, its reality remains to trouble the reader who is surprised not least</page><page sequence="15">Fredric Jameson 43 by the continuing vitality of a narrative line which ought to be sapped by such schematic intentions. It is not only the oversimplified interpretation of the rivalry between the Chevalier and Du Bousquier as the opposition between Aristocracy and Bourgeoisie which ought to bother us more than it does: allegory is a totalizing mode of reading and interpretation which, once set in motion, is only contained with the greatest difficulty, so that we ask ourselves, why, having set the first foot on this dangerous path, we do not find ourselves impelled to read meanings into everything else as well. For if the relationship between the Chevalier and Du Bousquier is the only allegorical element in the story, then we begin to wonder why it was necessary to add in other ancillary and apparently non-allegorical figures, such as that of the would-be Romantic poet Athanlase, who amounts to something like a Lucien de Rubemprn who succeeds in killing himself before he even gets to Paris. We remember also a fourth male figure, the Count de Troisville, whose return precipitates the final d6nouement; and, as if those elements were not enough to cast serious doubt on the allegorical scheme as a whole, we recall the character of Suzanne, whose departure to Paris and to the fortunes of a high class courtesan may be said to be the only success story in the book. We can, however, interpret the character of Suzanne allegorically without forcing the framework of the book too much: she would then represent that rootless demi-monde or Boh~me of which the supreme exemplars in other novels are the journalists, in a sense the only parties to have profited personally from the generalized failure of the Restoration as a whole; and the sex of Suzanne would underscore this parasitic character of the demi-monde, and its distance from some genuine progenitive class status. This interpretive possibility suggests that the other masculine figures also may entertain some more fundamental signifying relationship to each other than we have yet been able to disengage. M. de Troisville's physique, for instance ("en deux mots, Du Bousquier gentilhomme. Ii y avait entre eux toute la difference qui s6pare le genre vulgaire et le genre noble... La force du vicomte avait toute la distinction de l'616gance," etc., 295), suggests that we are here in the presence of a combinatoire in which the constituent elements or properties of the older characters are recombined to generate new ones (and to suggest this possibility is then to realize the degree to which even Du Bousquier himself was generated by a simple play of oppositions and inversions from the initial properties given in the portrait of the Chevalier itself). It is therefore difficult to avoid the hypothesis that "character" in this work of Balzac is not to be taken as the final narrative entity, but rather that the characters are themselves the combinations of more fundamental unities, traits or "shmes", whose systematic relationship to each other it ought to be possible to map out. Greimas' semantic rectanglel3 provides a useful way of replacing the older anthropomorphic categories with the model of a sign system, the initial features of which must surely be the relationship-already underscored in the opposition of the Chevalier to Du Bousquier-between the ancien rngime itself and its twin negations in the form of Napoleonic energy on the one hand, and the bourgeoisie on the other. In Greimas' terms these two negations of the initial starting point may then be seen as something like the opposite of the initial term, the anti-ancien-regime or -S, and its simple contradictory or the not-ancien-regime or S. Completing the logical possibilities, we</page><page sequence="16">44 The Ideology of Form emerge with a picture like this: S r S ancien rgime energy (Napoleon) naction -S S not-action bourgeoisie The first advantage of such a scheme is to explain our initial problem of how so grotesque but attachant a personality as the Chevalier could both typify and not typify the aristocracy itself, or better still, do both in succession. It now becomes clear that the Chevalier is himself only one possible combination of "shmes" among others: clearly, he is a composite of the terms offered by the left-hand side of the rectangle (ancien regime + not-action, or culture), while Du Bousquier unites those on the right (-S + S, or energy plus bourgeoisie). But this leaves two other logical possibilities, namely a combination of the two upper terms in a positive synthesis which would then amount to a transcendence of the initial opposition (S + -S); and a negative or private synthesis, which combining the two lower-level terms of -S and S would amount to something like the worst of both worlds. Let us suggest that this negative synthesis or neutral term can only be embodied by poor Althanase himself, Balzac's allegorical representation of Romanticism, in which culture and bourgeois origins unite in a sorry and self-cancelling amalgamation. This leaves the final or complex term, the positive synthesis, which can clearly designate none other than M. de Troisville himself, utopian synthesis of aristocracy and energy, the ideal husband for Mlle. Cormon, on whom the fabulist does not bestow him precisely because he is ideal. This is the significance of the fact that M. de Troisville returns from military service in Russia (that powerful force for reaction during this period with which Balzac himself had a complicated personal identification through the affair with Mme. Hanska): the Russian exile means simple that within the framework of the present cautionary narrative, the ideal synthesis is unavailable-it is not part of the spectrum of realistic French possibilities, yet must be included in the narrative in order to fill out the logical combinatoire and also as a prospect for the future. Our scheme now reemerges as follows: Troisville . S ..* oO ?? , S ancien regime energy? Chevalier Du Bousquier **,-~--r .* culture bourgeoisie " ? Athanase *'</page><page sequence="17">Fredric Jameson 45 The peculiar position of a character like the vicomte de Troisville indeed has significant implications for the kind of narrative form Balzac develops on the basis of such a characterological system. As a structural ideal, Troisville is both within and outside of the empirical action of the plot itself: a kind of horizon-character which allows Balzac to transcend the later antithesis that will emerge between a purely empirical satire of a degraded present and a tendentious or didactic sermonizing call for future action: Troisville's presence, as it were, marks the place of the future, keeps it warm, while permitting at the same time a pitiless dissection of the inadequacies of the present. His function in La Vieille Fille is therefore the normative one of the neighboring chateux of Ronquerolles and Soulanges in Les Paysans, which, never really represented in the narrative as such, mark the possibility of another and more genuinely aristocratic solution to the problem of the land than that, disastrous, executed by Montcornet whom we remember on this occasion to be representative only of the Napoleonic nobility and not the real thing itself. So the structure of the fable bears out Barberis' excellent characterization of the spirit of Balzac's political speculation: "Entre une aristocratie, contre tout espoir et toute possibilitY, a faire, et une bourgeoisie engagee sur la voie de la trahison, I'esprit h6site, vaguement attire, comme l'Histoire, en avant."l4 Such hesitation-rich with political content and animated by the qualifying and decoded movement described above-is inscribed in the very character system of the work, whose articulation then becomes the narrative itself. III. THE CONCEPT OF CHARACTER AND THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBJECT The preceding analyses have shown that the concept of character is doubly misleading, and conceals a variety of discontinuities beneath an appearance of homogeneity and a suggestion of regularity. For one thing, we have seen that, far from being the fundamental constitutive element or building block of narrative (all stories being presumably stories about "people"), a literary character can on occasion be the latter's locus, and serve itself as the framework within which the protonarrative of a play of partial systems and their transformations takes place. Meanwhile, in our discussion of Balzac's character system itself, we have begun to grasp the essential heterogeneity of a text in which satire and utopia coexist, and in which the so-called characters themselves entertain varying and quite distinct relationships with being and with historical possibility (or represent what Todorov would describe as varying degrees of modalization). The point, however, is not to substitute more refined categories for this evidently confused and, as we shall see shortly, fundamentally ideological one; but rather to problematize the notion of the literary character itself, and to make its unavoidable discussion into a permanent occasion for interrogating the nature of the subject itself (a word we here use in the twin sense of the psychological subject-what is more loosely and inaccurately called the ego or self-and the grammatical subject). Thus, the notion of the "horizon figure" which has been introduced here is not intended, whatever relevance it may have for certain other bodies of narrative, to</page><page sequence="18">46 The Ideology of Form provide a new category for narrative analysis in general, but rather to stand as the sign of a specific historical solution to narrative problems which was that of Balzac and which is unlikely to find exact structural parallels elsewhere. Indeed, the attempt to perfect a mechanism for the analysis of all narrative, or of narrative in general, must ultimately be sterile insofar as it presupposes a reduction of all types of narratives to an identical structural format. The semiotic approach to narrative is indeed fruitful only when it provides the materials for a combinatoire 15, that is, when its uniform conceptual machinery is directed towards the perception of historical difference and of the structural specificity of works from a given formal and social situation in comparison with those produced under different conditions. The other danger of the semiotic approach lies in the mirage of a complete mapping or blueprinting of the narrative work, for such an ideal tends fatally to suggest that the work is itself somehow a complete object, which can be analyzed in terms of pure positivities, without recourse to the negative perceptions of dialectical thinking, and which knows no discontinuities or sudden lapses of being. Yet the literary "character" presents, as we have seen, just such a discontinuity which cannot be dealt with in the fashion of the positive categories of scientific models. Nor would we wish the foregoing analysis to represent an endorsement of systems analysis as such; the term "partial system" was intended to underscore the incommensurability between any given individual system and the work as a whole. Indeed, the reader will have understood that from our point of view all systems are in this particular sense of the word merely "partial" systems. It is becoming more widely appreciated that, along with a number of other key concepts of traditional literary criticism, such as the notion of the "organic unity" of the work of artl6, the category of the literary "character" is an ideological one whose function lies in reinforcing that philosophy of the subject itself-with its substantive unity as a self or ego-which is a fundamental component of bourgeois individualism. Frangois Rastier has indeed made a semiotic analysis of the various ways in which the traditional perception of literary characters emits the lateral ideological message of a universal human nature.'7 Here if anywhere, we may see confirmation for the Tel Quel position that the very act of reception of the traditional literary work has an ideological function, that the very formal categories of the classical work, whatever its local historical or psychological content, constitute a kind of ritual whereby a certain number of metaphysical-but also social and historical-propositions are implicitly affirmed or reinforced (this is not the place to suggest that ideology has other, less formal delivery mechanisms as well, nor to demonstrate the ahistorical fashion in which the Tel Quel group reifies its basic ideological categories). What is perhaps less well understood is the systematizing and homogenizing effect even of those theories of the literary character which attempt to register some fundamental discontinuity within the phenomenon so named. Thus, it is clear that Forster's "round characters" and "flat characters", and above and beyond that, the various theories of "point of view" which all in one way or another try to distinguish between something like a "being-for-itself" of the observing consciousness and a "being-for-others" of the individual character seen from the outside, are attempts to bring back under a single common denominator realities which are quite</page><page sequence="19">Fredric Jameson 47 incommensurable with each other. Neither the proponents of one or another version of the notion of "identification" nor its adversaries have been successful in devising a systematic view of dcharacter able to do justice to this heterogeneity, which is a good deal more complicated than a simple dialectic between the "self'" and the "other". The semiotic reduction, indeed-proposing to replace the anthropomorphic category of the "character" with such more formalized categories as Propp's "function" or Greimas' "actant"-continues to maintain the relationship between something like a gram- matical subject on the one hand and a series of actions on the other which constituted the metaphysical and ideological content of the older concept in the first place.18 Meanwhile, Hans Robert Jauss' revision of Northrop Frye's typology of the distances between the reader and the various types of narrative herol9 usefully reminds us of the aesthetic distance implicit even in the classical conceptions of "identification" to be found in Aristotle and Kant; and has the added merit of introducing greater historical specification into Frye's typology by distinguishing between the content of such notions as sympathy in the classical period, the middle ages, the 18th century, and so forth. Yet insofar as his discussion is limited to the "hero" or the protagonist of narrative, it presupposes the very concept of character which we have here been concerned to call into question. Jauss' first type of identification, indeed-which is misnamed the "associative" and which has historical as well as logical priority insofar as it designates that "transitivistic" or role-shifting, pre-aesthetic structure of games that characterizes ceremony or ritual-usefully redramatizes the problem for us. For the inadequacy of the traditional conceptions of character, while brought home to us by many of the experiments of modernism, cannot fully be measured until we step outside the bounds of the European canon and begin to sense the profound structural differences it presents, in this and other respects, with what has generally been called the archaic phenomenon, not only of ritual, but also of primitive myth, and, indeed, of some of the narrative materials of our own dreams. The latter, indeed, with their strings of episodes and their "heroes" with whom no identification is possible, and to whom the notion of any psychological unification is patently inapplicable, set the terms and fix the boundaries of the problem of character in such a way as to demand the rethinking of all of our traditional categories in this area. To do justice to the problem would be tantamount to developing a post-individualistic theory of the subject, as well as a vision of the place of the subject in some more genuinely collective social form. There are, of course, scattered anticipations of the form such a theory might take, particularly in Lacan's notion of the decentered subject20 and Bakhtin's conception of dialogical speech.21 The notion of a character system developed here22 is not a contribution of that kind, but may nonetheless serve to illustrate something of the complexity of a narrative in search of a narrative subject.
