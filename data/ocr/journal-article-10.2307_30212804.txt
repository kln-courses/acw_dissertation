<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Jeremiah Wells: An Early Keatsian Poet PRISCILLA JOHNSTON EVEN though a great deal of work has been done on writers who influenced Keats, writers who were influenced by the poet have attracted little commentary. One of the authors most neglected by students of influence has been Charles Jeremiah Wells (ca. 18oo00?-1879),1 certainly the earliest and probably the most overt follower that Keats ever had. A sometime friend of the Keats brothers, the eccentric, mercurial Wells published only one book of poetry, a Biblical closet drama entitled Joseph and his Brethren which promptly followed its models into early ob- scurity. Critically ignored at its first publication in 1824, Wells's Joseph was uncovered twenty years later by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who made it "a kind of Shibboleth-a rite of initiation into the true poetic culture."2 In league with some dozen of the better-known late Victorian writers, in- cluding Swinburne, J. A. Symonds, and George Meredith, Rossetti suc- ceeded in having a revised version ofJoseph issued in 1876. The second edition, however, disappeared into oblivion as rapidly as the first, despite widespread critical praise sprinkled with comparisons to Shakespeare, Blake, and Milton. When the work came out, no one thought to compare it to Keats's poetry, and no one made much of Wells's biographical association with Keats. Yet we can instantly see that Joseph and his Brethren shows an aware- ness of, and a skill in, even the most arcane aspects of the Keatsian style. Although much of Wells's lengthy drama is marred by bombast erring on the side of Beddoes, the poetry of its nondramatic portions-prologues, 1. The date of Wells's birth remains uncertain, as much because of his own obfuscation as for any other reason. In "Charles Jeremiah Wells," Keats-Shelley Memorial Bulletin, 22 (1971), 7, Molly Tatchell follows most sources in suggesting 1800 as the correct date, but a number of sources give either 1798 or 1799; other attributions ranging from 1793 to 1802 only augment the confusion. 2.

Let us take, for example, a passage from the Pro- logue to Act I, in which Wells evokes a scene of early pagan man com- pletely in harmony with his natural universe-and which presents, in fact, another version of the feast scene that introduces Endymion: The shepherd beats his bell; the tranquil herds Lowing obedience, from the dimpled spring (Where the bright flowers disturb'd with their sweet breath Tremble like starry gems in Dian's hair), Slow wind the hill, and in their staked folds Snuff the fresh straw and scent the keener wind, Crook their sleek knees to welcome night's repose. The Sun while sinking from his daily round Had starr'd the heavens like a fiery flaw, Showing his glory greater than the west: Glancing the Moon and frightening her faint beam, Across the barred portals of the East His fulgent heat reflected glowing fire. The dying embers of the burnish'd king, Now sunk behind the mountain'd hemisphere, Were fading fast away. He was declin'd (Not like pale Cynthia to her bath, a lake Rich in its violet sward and jasmine bowers), A god gigantic habited in gold, Stepping from offa mount into the sea: The evening breeze that whispers of repose, And fans the crimson'd marygold to sleep, Grows sharp and brisk; and silence on the light Gains step for step, as light retires to shade. The tawny harvestmen from yellow fields Their sweet repast, their lated meal enjoy Hard by their tents, beneath some ample oak, Or vine, or fig-tree burthen'd with its fruit And fragrant to the air.3 3.

Indeed, such an assimilation of Keatsian modes and motifs becomes especially clear in comparison to Endymion's passage on sunrise at Latmos: Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed So plenteously all weed-hidden roots Into o'erhanging boughs, and precious fruits. And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep, Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep A lamb stray'd far a-down those inmost glens, Never again saw he the happy pens Whither his brethren, bleating with content, Over the hills at every nightfall went. Paths there were many, Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny, And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly To a wide lawn, whence one could only see Stems thronging all around between the swell Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell The freshness of the space of heaven above, Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove Would often beat its wings, and often too A little cloud would move across the blue. Full in the middle of this pleasantness There stood a marble altar, with a tress Of flowers budded newly; and the dew Had taken fairy phantasies to strew Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve, And so the dawned light in pomp receive.

(1.63-75, 79-100oo)4 Not only has Wells appropriated the more obvious aspects of Keats's pas- sage-the Grecian subject matter; the synthesizing alternation between heaven, earth, and man; the cast of pastoral characters-but he has manip- ulated these elements with more technical skill than Keats himself pos- sessed at this time, showing far more control over line endings and place- ment of the caesura. Most striking, however, is Wells's assimilation of that lush sensuousity so characteristic of Keats; indeed, Wells nearly out- does Keats himself in "loading every rift with ore," packing his scene with parenthetic extensions of images, piling simile on simile and sense-stimu- lus on sense-stimulus. And Wells shows uncommon perception intoKeats's use of exact and startling word combinations which pull the poem out of normalcy into an exotic fantasy-realm, with the help of lush phrases like "violet sward," archaisms like "burthen'd," and arcane Latinisms like "ful- gent." In fact, Wells's effort to achieve a Keatsian art-language goes far deeper than a rendition of his model's surface mannerisms: for example, he adopts such an obscure technique as Keats's own coining of process- verbs from adjectives, here compressed back into adjectival form: "crim- son'd marygold." Elsewhere in the poem, Wells introduces entire characters which seem to come right out of Endymion-country, again showing remarkable per- spicuity as to Keats's own purposes. For example, even though Keats's description of Cynthia in Book I has been criticized as so much youthful extravagance, we see that its alternation between anthropomorphic and natural elements actually provides a sophisticated solution to a difficult technical problem: how to incarnate a goddess without impoverishing her immateriality: Ah! see her hovering feet, More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows 4. This and all further quotations from Endymion are taken from The Poetical Works of John Keats, ed. H. W. Garrod, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford Univ.

(Endymion 1.624-632) Wells faces a similar problem when he tries to depict Rachael, Joseph's deceased mother, and he solves his problem with a descriptive method which is certainly modeled on Keats's Cynthia: The dim-blue-laced veins on either brow, Neath the transparent skin meandering, That with the silvery-leaved lily vied; Her full dark eye, whose brightness glisten'd through The sable lashes soft as camel-hair; Her slanting head curv'd like the maiden moon And hung with hair luxuriant as a vine And blacker than a storm; her rounded ear Turn'd like a shell upon some golden shore; Her whispering foot that carried all her weight, Nor left its little pressure on the sand; Her lips as drowsy poppies, soft and red, Gathering a dew from her escaping breath... (i.iii, pp. 35-36) Not only has Wells realized (as modern critics have not) Keats's actual purpose in the Cynthia passage-to give substance to someone who is not really there, whether she is a goddess or a dead spirit-but he has also realized (as his own age did not) that such apparently stylistic manipula- tion actually confirms a significant epistemological stance: in both poets, a belief in the immanent, sensuously available principle of beauty. At times, however, Wells's keen sensitivity to the most arcane details of Keats's style leads him into downright plagiarism: for instance, Joseph's "dimpled spring" more than likely sprang from Endymion's own "fount," which fish were "dimpling" in Book rI, line 136. And, if we are seeking the source ofJoseph's headpiece of"poppied corn," we need only look as far as Keats's "Hymn to Pan" for the same startling phrase (1.255). While</page><page sequence="6">Charles Jeremiah Wells 77 Joseph abounds with such verbal echoes, however, they generally occur in the far less egregious form of unconscious plagiarism, with Wells seizing upon a single Keatsian detail, as in the year Grows lush in juicy stalks ... ere yet the bees Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, (Endymion 1.45-46, 51-52) and elaborating it into a full-blown description: The grass is thick with flowers upon crisp stalks Full of the juicy virtues of the place: A rainbow garland for the brow of spring With globed clover full of honey-dew And sweeter than the cowslip. (I.iii, p. 27) However greatly the Victorians admired such description, they were completely oblivious to Wells's primary interest for us: his skillful and canny manipulation of the Keatsian idiom. Such keenness becomes all the more remarkable when we consider that Wells was apparently alone in the depth of his stylistic understanding; that Joseph was his first attempt at a serious poem; that it was written at the age of nineteen or twenty; and that it was not followed by another published poem of any significance.5 Such a bizarre combination of circumstances may be explained by looking at Wells's own life, and particularly at his association with the Keats brothers. Wells was something of a cipher, a man so various that his own brother- in-law called him "a most dangerous and insidious person," while his most intimate friend recalled only his intense charisma: "He had only to see a man to make him do anything."6 Wells himself enjoyed such con- fusions, and later augmented the enigma by lying about his age, equivocat- ing about his poetry, destroying his personal papers, and circulating odd tales about his private life.

Wells shared similar family circumstances with Keats: both sets of parents came from a rising Cockney middle class; both families consigned the youths to respectable professions for which they had little inclination. In Wells's case, such familial aspirations forced him to become a solicitor, much against his will. Wells seems to have become acquainted with the Keats boys in 1816, when he was attending school at Edmonton.7 He first grew friendly with Tom Keats, closest to him in age, and then with John, who was appren- ticed to an Edmonton apothecary at the time. The association was close enough for Wells to become the subject of one of the poet's early com- memorative sonnets, "To a Friend Who Sent Me Some Roses" (written 29 June 1816). Wells also received a presentation copy of the 1817 Poems with a dignified inscription, "From J.K. to his young friend Wells." Per- haps Keats-at twenty-one, about four years older-felt it necessary to remind the somewhat rowdy Wells that he was a mere young thing-a perceptive remark, in view of Wells's later behavior to Tom.8 Leaving Clarke's school in 1817, Wells went through the motions of a legal apprenticeship in London: he was "articled... to some near relation," said a friend, "and the amount of law-reading and knowledge possessed by both was just as little as possible."'9 Fortunately for Wells, the Keats brothers had also moved to London. In November 1817, Tom-ailing with tuberculosis-was packed off to Teignmouth in George's care, while Wells and John spent the next two months in the city. Sometimes their 7. Like so many episodes in Wells's life, the place where he attended school is not certain: it is possible, for example, that he may have gone to John Clarke's school at Enfield with Tom Keats. Wells was certainly the schoolmate of R. H. Home, but we do not know for certain where Home himself was educated. One of Home's biographers, Ann Blainey, suggests that the two attended Clarke's school (The Farthing Poet [London: Longmans Greene &amp; Co., 1968], p. 13); but Home himself remembered Wells as "my friend since we were schoolboys together at Edmonton" (letter to the Academy, 19 April 1879, p. 350). Tatchell offers further evidence that Home and Wells attended school at Edmonton ("Wells," KSMB, 22 (1971), 8), making this the likeliest possibility. 8. Buxton Forman suggests that the sonnet was occasioned by a practical joke played by Wells upon Tom Keats ("Concerning the Friend Who Sent Keats Some Roses," Twelfth Year Book [Boston: Boston Bibliophile Society, 1913], p. 78). But there is no firm evidence to support such a story, apart from speculation by R. H. Home; it may well be one of many inaccuracies in Forman's reminiscences about Wells. 9.

But his letters to his brothers often describe more riotous episodes in which Wells figured prominently: "Wells &amp; Severn dined with me yesterday: we had a very pleasant day-I pitched upon another bottle of claret-Port-we enjoyed ourselves very much were all very witty and full of Rhyme-we played a Concert from 4 o'clock till to-drank your Healths."11 Wells also took advantage of his actress mother's theatrical connections, bringing along the dubious Keats, who relates that yesterday evening I made an appointment with Wells, to go to a private theatre &amp; it being in the neighborhood of Drury Lane, &amp; thinking we might be fatigued with sitting the whole evening in one dirty hole; I got the Drury Lane ticket &amp; therewith we divided the evening with a spice of Richard m.12 Such diversions came to an abrupt end in March 1818, when Keats left for Teignmouth to nurse Tom, whose condition had deteriorated dan- gerously by late spring, after they returned to London. Between July and August, Tom was inundated with lovesick letters from one "Amena Bellefila"-who was presently exposed as Charles Wells himself. "It is a joke so obvious," observes Robert Gittings, "that it seems certain it was meant to be found out." The body of these cruel letters consisted of "a parody of the romantic mock-Spenserian language used by the Keats boys and their circle . . . packed with pointed references to some of the worst lines, couplets, and stanzas of Keats's own youthful poems."i'3 A sample: Now would dame Fortune Fickle Jade grant me but my request Id prove to the[e] whether I could be ungrateful this Instant would I bind about thy Loins a Cuirass a Shield &amp; Sword Id give to the[e] Tempered with my Virgin Blessing upon thy head so honorable would I place a to.

Like his brother, he tended toward emotional extremes, and his "chagrin at the discovery of the deception was so desperate that his brother John believed it to have hastened his end."15 Tom died on 1 December 1818. The jejune prank drove John frantic with rage-he was, after all, far from well himself-even though he did not grasp the full extent of the deception until the year following Tom's death, when he went over "Amena's" letters and his brother's credulous replies: I have been to Mrs Bentley's this morning and put all the letters two [sic] and from you and poor Tom and me-I have found some of the correspondance between him and that degraded Wells and Amena-It is a wretched business. I do not know the rights of it .... I hate it to a sickness. When he finally pieced together the whole affair, Keats became the im- placable enemy of Wells, recording his horror and rage with a bitterness almost unparalleled even in his darkest late correspondence: "I have been looking over the correspondence of the pretended Amena and Wells this evening," he writes to George, and I now see the whole cruel deception.... The instigations to this dia- bolical scheme were vanity, and the love of intrigue. It was no thought- less hoax-but a cruel deception on a sanguine Temperament, with every show of friendship. I do not think death too bad for the villain. S. . I consider it my duty to be prudently revengeful.... I will be opium to his vanity-if I cannot injure his interests--....

Among the Keats papers, there is no further mention of Wells, while Bux- ton Forman's collection of Wells letters observes a pristine silence about the whole affair. Cruel, tactless, and tawdry though the Amena debacle appears, it does provide an early example of Wells's extraordinarily firm grasp on those essential qualities of Keats's immature poems: the vivid Spenserian dic- tion, the dependence on romance, and, above all, the hyperbolic sensu- osity that Keats later tamed into effective verse. Indeed, like all burlesque, the Amena letter indicates in crude form an acute critical comprehension of Keats's verse, foreshadowing that more serious emulation that we saw in the] Joseph passage at the start of this paper.17 In fact, the Amena affair and the subsequent rupture with Keats pro- voked Wells into writing Joseph, the poem which was to make him a celebrity fully half a century later. Many years after the rupture, Wells claimed that Keats's wrath had directly impelled him to write his "master- piece," admitting rather pathetically that "I wrote it in six weeks to com- pel Keats to esteem me and admit my power, for we had quarrelled, and everybody who knew him must feel I was in fault."'8 The date of the poem's inception is uncertain, but it was probably composed sometime between 1 818 and 1820 for, by Wells's own account, he was twenty years old at the time. News of Keats's death, which did not reach him until early 1822, probably puts an outside limit on the composition. Apart from helping to date the work, Wells's recollection may provide 17. Wells does, however, collapse into "Amena" jargon at infrequent spots in] Joseph, al- though the 1 876 revision exises most of the offending lines. A sample that remained in the later edition: and his sable hair, Like strakey as a mane, fell where it would, And somewhat hid his glossy sun-brent neck And carcanet of precious sardonyx. (m.iii, p. 189) But the phrase occurs in the midst of a massive new interpolation: probably Wells lapsed into Keatsian Spenserisms just as his model lapsed into Huntisms at points of fatigue during Endymion. 18.

Wells himself failed to take the poem seriously as a work of art: after completing the manuscript, he simply shelved it and for a while forgot its existence. Perhaps, having word of Keats's death, he felt that the literary riposte was pointless; just as likely, the phlegmatic Wells simply lost interest in his future "master- piece," for he was always unable to evaluate his own work, always amazed and amused that others saw merit in it. Besides, Wells had by this time dashed into further literary enterprises, again sparked by Keats's interests. Before the break with Wells, Keats and Reynolds had concocted a scheme to versify certain of Boccaccio's tales, and Wells promptly set to work on his own volume emulating the medi- evalizing mood, though not the subject matter, of Boccaccio. The result, entitled Stories after Nature, was "a curious little volume of brocaded prose"19 which adopted a half-Gothic, half-Keatsian manner, tracing protagonists with fantastical names like "Casimir" and "Cleone" through various intrigues which often amount to little more than a collection of elaborately choreographed gestures. Much of the material remains at the level of the Amena letters, as the following swashbuckling description indicates: But when his wandering eyes settled on his brother's face, he spread his arms like a demon, and staggered forward with a face loaded with malice and wilful power (though masked in blood), and ran upon Claude's sword, raising up his heavy arms with out-spread hands, he stood as if invoking the demon of his incorrigible will; and drunk with his own blood, and stupified with wounds, fell flat on his back, haggled and bloody, like a dog.20 The sentence is one that Horace Walpole could well be proud of. At other points, however, Wells abandons his debased Gothic style to insert a passage emulating Keats's style, particularly his method of prolonging a simile to elicit a certain vague mood: "As a wizard sitteth at a moonlight casement by a magic torch, knitting a vexed brow, and sweating at the discovery of some webbed problem of enchantment, so Theodose set 19.

Indeed, Wells's simile is essentially a prose version of the moody writing of"Isabella" and Keats's other medieval poems. Wells, however, viewed his volume rather casually, as another riposte to Keats's anger. Keats's own final volume, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve ofSt. Agnes, and Other Poems, had appeared in 1820, followed the year after by Reynolds' work; and Wells's brother-in-law recalled that the Stories had then been produced "in the purest spirit of jocose rivalry" with Keats, Wells being unaware that the poet was then dying in Rome.22 Stories after Nature was published privately, at Wells's expense, by T. &amp; J. Allman and C. &amp; J. Ollier in 1822, not long after Wells had received word of Keats's death the preceding year. The volume was critically ig- nored, but perhaps the mere fact of its publication incited him to dust off the]oseph manuscript, or-just perhaps-even Wells was not brash enough to publish such a close emulation of Keats while the poet was still on the scene, still enraged, and still supported by Hunt and his set. In any case, Wells decided to try his luck with] Joseph-hardly a pro- pitious undertaking, since a closet drama recounting the story of Joseph and the coat of many colors, which was, moreover, in the "Cockney" Keats vein, could only excite indifference, if not downright ridicule. After many rejections, Whittaker agreed to undertake the book, and it appeared in December 1823, under the pseudonym of "H. L. Howard."23 Even before its publication, Wells abandoned his poem, letting a friend work over the proofs; his negligence even caused him to forget his own pseud- onym at a meeting with George Whittaker, an omission that Wells con- sidered hugely funny and quite in the spirit of the game. The critics shared his nonchalance. "Never did a book fall more dead from the press than did] Joseph and his Brethren," Rossetti later recalled; in fact, he could find only one critical response, consisting of "a brief and depreciatory paragraph in the Annual Register for 1824."24 Sales were so 21.

Thus, ignored by critics and public alike, the venture seemed to have failed quite decisively. Wells was not perturbed, for he was completely unable to stay with any project for longer than a few weeks. Indeed, from this point on, his life became increasingly erratic, broken into a series of brief, intensive experi- ments and quixotic moves. Shortly after the quarrel with Keats, he made friends with William Hazlitt, then argued with him; he attempted more dramas, then tore them up, claiming that the ruptures with Keats and Hazlitt had broken his spirit. He abandoned law for a bee-keeping enter- prise, then abandoned that in turn. In fact, hunting and horticulture be- came his only consistent interests, although he persisted in writing verse as an occasional pastime. Having experimented with various homes in England, he moved to Brittany around 1840, leaving his family to pursue a rather haphazard existence in both France and England. (His son, Charles Wells, Jr., became as irregular as his father, for a series of investment hoaxes landed him in various English and French jails, and made him hero of the song "The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.") Thus, to all appearances, Wells himself had settled into the role of a dissolute country squire; but his Joseph inspired almost uncanny appeal for a few friends, who refused to let it remain interred by the public. Richard Hengist Horne (1802-1884), an old schoolmate and later, an au- thor and friend of the Brownings, tried to create a stir for Joseph in several articles during the '30's and '40's, recruiting the help of the neo-Shelleyan poet Thomas Wade. Their enthusiasm assumed an oddly fanatical aura: Horne, for example, turned the affable Wells into a tragic latter-day Byron, one of those who may write an occasional tragedy for their own satisfaction, or that of a friend, but they do not deign to offer them to the be-devilled bear- garden of the royal patent theatres! They prefer retiring into the wilds of Yorkshire, Cumberland, or North Wales; and not unfrequently seek a precarious existence in voluntary exile to some far distant country.25 25.

In the mid '40o's Rossetti had borrowed Joseph and the Stories from a friend and, raving about them with "insane exhultation," made the volumes required read- ing for his flock of aspiring Pre-Raphaelites who, as Theodore Watts- Dunton later recalled, "had to read Joseph and his Brethren in order to exist."28 Only one other poet-Keats-achieved this degree of stature in the Rossetti circle, even though, amazingly enough, no one thought of comparing the two. With Rossetti's energetic backing reinforced by Swinburne, the Wells revival picked up momentum that had not been possible under the more decorous agency of Horne and Wade. By 1849, Rossetti had determined to see Joseph reissued, enlisting numerous acquaintances to campaign with 26.

All three objectives came to nothing. However, the new interest in Joseph stimulated Wells to release some old writings from Brittany, just as the Stories had renewed his interest in] Joseph decades earlier. He sent over two hunting articles, which were published in Fraser's in 1846 and 1847;29 a historical romance, which was not published at all, and--most important-a new revision of Joseph, adding several hundred lines, mainly description, and pruning anachronisms, weak rhythms, and forced imagery. Wells thus flooded the market with a wide variety of genres in the hope that something would catch on, thereby demonstrating his extraordinary flexibility and skill at assuming different authorial guises, the persona of John Keats being only one guise. An accomplished "PR" man, he sent over his wife along with his writings to pleadJoseph's cause. But publishers were still chary of the drama, for its Biblical subject mat- ter and nugatory 1824 sales had made the book an obvious risk. A break- through did not come until 1875, when the firm of Chatto &amp; Windus engaged to undertake the volume on the condition that Swinburne edit it and that he publish an essay far enough in advance to insure public interest -and, incidentally, good sales. Swinburne accordingly placed an essay in the Fortnightly Review for 1 February 1875; Wells-aged seventy-five or seventy-six-received his revision back for final changes and immediately lost it. (It has not turned up since.) Unperturbed, he produced an en- tirely new revision in several weeks, expanding descriptions and pruning technical errors as he had in the lost revision. Joseph finally reappeared in 1876, fully fifty-eight years after its incep- tion in Wells's rupture with Keats. This time, the book attracted wide and nearly unanimous critical acclaim which, among other hyperboles, termed Wells a "mute inglorious Milton" and compared-or rather, equated- him with Shakespeare.30 Ironically enough, one of the most enthusiastic appraisals of Wells's Keatsian poem appeared in the London Quarterly 29. "A Boar Hunt in Brittany" appeared in October 1846, followed by a "sequel" in June 1847: "Love-Passages in the Life of Perron the Breton." 30. An especially egregious instance of such indiscriminate criticism appears in the review of the Athenaeum, 5 February 1876, p. 192, which exclaims in "astonishment at the sight of genius, ordinarily so robust, withdrawing in pain before an untimely breath of frost," and inveighs at great length against "Fate which refuses to youthful brows the coveted and ap- propriate crown, and places it, as if in derision, upon whitened temples."</page><page sequence="16">Charles Jeremiah Wells 87 Review, the periodical which had printed the Endymion review by John Wilson Croker which Shelley believed to have caused Keats's death. Nonetheless, Joseph's second edition met essentially the same fate as its first, for such critical excitement-much of it generated by members of Rossetti's and Swinburne's own circle-failed to stimulate sales; in fact, the book could hardly be given away. Wells, painfully ill, contemplated still another revision, this time along religious lines in keeping with his new interest in Roman Catholic mysticism; but the book's unpopularity made such a revision unthinkable.31 He died almost penniless in 1879, having impulsively burned some ten volumes of poetry, stories, novels, and essays-the body of his life's work. Although the 1876]oseph was revived in 1908, it soon passed out of print for the last time. In 1913, Buxton For- man brought out a final essay on Wells, and, with the exception ofMolly Tatchell's biographical article on Wells, his uniquely interesting work has been ignored ever since. Such oblivion seems both remarkable and undeserved. Granted that Wells's magnum opus is badly flawed-its "plot" trifling, its length exces- sive, its preaching sometimes intrusive--Joseph's poetry still makes fasci- nating reading both for its own beauty and for its uncanny Keatsian aura. Other nineteenth-century closet dramatists-Beddoes, Darley, Taylor- are well known by students of Romanticism who do not recognize Wells, even though he is at least as interesting as, and perhaps more talented than, the other practitioners of the genre. Even apart from his work's own merits, Wells's complex biographical association with Keats should rec- ommend him to our attention, while the zany comedy of errors that con- stitutes Joseph's publication history provides still another link between Keats and the late Victorians that should not go ignored.
