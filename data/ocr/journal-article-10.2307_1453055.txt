<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RABBINIC MIND IN UNDERTAKING the scientific task of analysing the rabbinic mind,* Dr. Max Kadushin recognized that, if he was not to follow the beaten track, he would have to call into play an effective vocabulary of rabbinic thought. The vocabulary would have to serve as pointers to the con- cepts of the rabbis and not be confused with their own terms. He was further aware that any presentation of rabbinic statements, even if it were only a classification, would constitute an interpretation. He had to guard himself against treating their teachings alone without relating them to the whole texture of rabbinic thought. His work, therefore, is devoted to two main interests, to the creation of a descriptive vocab- ulary for rabbinic ideas, and, with its aid, to re-examine much of the content of rabbinic thought. His first four chapters are concerned with rabbinic value-concepts, their organization and the ways of their identification. He, then, dis- cusses the "category of significance" in the aggada and in halaka, indeter- minancy in thought and in action, the concepts of natural order, miracle and the common-place and the holy. The section on "normal mysti- cism" includes an analysis of the experience of God, revelation and man's relationship to God. The closing chapter on "this side of philos- ophy" deals with anthropomorphism, organic development of rabbinic thought, the otherness of God, anthropomorphism and Targum Onkelos and rabbinic dogma. It is Kadushin's contention that scholars have failed to find an organizing principle for the systematization of the varied rabbinic statements because they have approached the material from a philo- sophical point of view. They were eventually bound to find that rabbinic statements do not fit into any logical scheme. He therefore undertook to go beyond the rabbinic utterances to the concepts which they embody and which they themselves had crystallized into single words or terms. He considers these concepts elements of a "great organismic complex," and holds that rabbinic thought, far from being chaotic, is completely coherent. "We have to do here," he adds, "not *The Rabbinic Mind, by Max Kadushin. The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New York. 1952. Pp. xvii-394. 244</page><page sequence="2">THE RABBINIC MIND-COHON 245 with a system of thought projected by a mind but with the rabbinic mind itself, with the elements of the mind as they grasp the facts of normal, every-day experience" (p. 31). Kadushin coins the term "value-concept" to express rabbinic ideas. These value-concepts differ from philosophic ideas in that they are not "fully formulated." Instead of being a defect, the absence of a clear definition is regarded a virtue, inasmuch as it permits "the rabbinic concept to function easily and effectively." What is more, the value-concepts are not only undefined, but also undefinable. Hence they are flexible and can respond to and express the differentia of personality. At the same time they convey abstract, generalized ideas common to all the members of the group. Consequently the complex of value-concepts is sufficiently meaningful and colorful to make the individuals employing them a unified group of a recognizable character. Value-concepts are, then, decisive factors in the development of the self and in the stabilization of society. As such, their importance is not confined to the rabbis and their followers but to every civilized society. The reason for the failure hitherto to identify value-concepts, despite the common use of "values" and "value-judgments," Kadushin ascribes to their being frequently unapparent. They are symbolized by words or terms but only when the concepts are referred to abstractly. In all other instances they are "not mentioned by name but are, as it were, imbedded in an action or a statement" (p. 3). Hence they pass un- noticed. Kaddushin is not quite satisfied with the term. The component "concept" suggests that the ideas are communicable and may be shared by others, while the other component "values" suggests that, in a degree, they are subjective. Neither does the term convey the fact that they are commonly shared,- folk-ideas. The word can be taken further to mean that "the concepts evaluate, appraise or estimate," which is not always the case. They "endow actions or situations or events with significance" and "in terms of the particular concept embodied in the situation or event" (p. 5). Being single words or terms, value-concepts cannot be organized into a static system. Only as they are employed in speech or in action can their coherence be demonstrated. This coherence is an organismic one, a fact which has many consequences. One of them is the atomistic effect of value-concepts. Each one of them is "a complete and inde- pendent entity in itself" (p. 5). Not articulated into a hard and fast system, they can convey the individual's moods, his reactions under</page><page sequence="3">246 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW trying circumstances, his own peculiarities of temperament and his deep rooted convictions. Accordingly, these value-concepts, in the view of Kadushin, possess the dynamic power to function to a greater degree than philosophic concepts. While logic does not build them up, logical analysis plays a role in the evaluational life, enabling us to apply the value-concepts. This is particularly the case in the halaka. Because of the common usage, value-concepts appear simple. Actually, they "involve one subtle experience after another" since they pertain to the inner personal and social relationships. Each value-concept is represented by a conceptual term, always "substantive, connotative and peculiar to the particular concept," as, for example, derech erez, malchut shamayim, mizwah, etc. Ideas not represented by conceptual terms serve only as "auxiliary ideas, different in character from dynamic value-concepts" (p. 58). The conceptual term is not necessarily present wherever the concept is embodied in a rabbinic statement, but is bound to occur in some passages. In their relation to the Bible Kadushin distinguishes three types. First, there are concepts having conceptual terms not contained in the Bible, but are clearly foreshadowed there, as in the case of malchut shamayim, kiddush hashem, teshubah, middat hadin, middat harahamim, etc. A second type consists of concepts in which the conceptual term is the same as in the Bible, but with wider and more universal connotation, like ger, Israel and olam. The third type is related to the second, except that in it the conceptual term has a different meaning from that which it had in the Bible, as in the case of goy, nes and zedakah. (The rabbinic connotation of zedakah as charity appeared in late strata of the Bible.) By virtue of having a name, Kadushin points out, value-concepts are able to perform the dual function of abstraction and classification. They are abstractions with idea-content. Their presence in rabbinic literature shows that genuine abstract thought is not limited to philosophy and science. The question suggests itself: May they not rather show that rabbinic literature contains abstract valuational concepts akin to those used in philosophy? The terms nes and sidre bereshit, whose relation to philosophy Kadushin acknowledges, need not be exceptional. The same applies to olam and particularly to hochmah, binah and daat, which he does not mention at all. Value-concepts, in Kadushin's view, are not inferred and cannot be the result of speculation or observation. However, he admits that they have a history (p. 47). Their very relation to the Bible indicates a development by way of clarification of meaning, of universality or of</page><page sequence="4">THE RABBINIC MIND-COHON 247 contrast. How did these and related concepts arise in the Bible itself and in rabbinic literature? Kadushin negates the efforts of anthropol- ogists like Tylor, who tried to seek the origin of the belief in the soul in dream experience, or of Bible scholars like G. A. Smith, who found in the irregularity of Palestine's climate a contributory factor in the rise of the belief in providence, and of others of the Wellhausen school who endeavored to account for the origin of monotheism by the political events of Israel's history. It may be admitted that this or that attempt at explaining the appearance of a concept has failed of its purpose without removing the need of searching for more adequate explanations. In keeping with his hypothesis of "organismic thinking," Kadushin denies the existence of a "hierarchical system" in rabbinic thought. In his earlier work, the "Theology of Seder Elijahu," he tried to show that rabbinical literature is dominated by four concepts of a special character, viz., God's justice, God's love, Torah and Israel. (These concepts are too narrowly drawn. If Israel is a main concept, then why not also the nations and man, and if the attributes of justice and love, then why not unity, the key concept of Judaism?) Each one of these four has its own sub-concepts. Together they play the dominant role in the organization of the complex of rabbinic ideas. However, no one of them is placed above the others as if it were of major and the rest of minor rank. They belong to the same group rather than being placed together by conscious valuation. Rabbinic thought seems to teach the contrary. For example, the Mekilta (ed. Lauterbach, II, p. 237) derives obedience to the mizvot from the acceptance of malchut shamayim. And may we not consider malchut shamayim as the prime concept from which Kadushin's four main concepts derive? In the absence of abstract terms for the auxiliary ideas of God's omniscience, omnipotence, etc., Kadushin sees a characteristic of rabbinic religion. If rabbinic Judaism were a kind of religious philos- ophy there would have been an attempt to represent all ideas, including the auxiliary ideas by abstract conceptual symbols. But rabbinic Judaism had no occasion to speak of these ideas in any abstract manner (p. 220). Furthermore, to treat auxiliary ideas as if they were ideas in themselves is to do violence to rabbinic thought (p. 221). This applies to conceptualizing these ideas. We wonder what "violence" to rabbinic thought would have been done if terms for "omniscience," "providence," "revelation," "original sin," etc., had been coined? To hold, as Kadushin does in the case of</page><page sequence="5">248 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW "omniscience," that the term adds nothing to the general statement "all is foreseen," begs the question. We may say the same of his argument that in the statement "everything is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven" the rabbis were not concerned with freedom of the will but only with the consideration that the "fear of Heaven" is not forced upon man (pp. 52 ff.). To call these concepts auxiliary, does not account for the absence of conceptual terms for them. It is hardly possible that the rabbis had no occasion to speak of them in abstract conceptual symbols. The fact is that numerous vital ideas, which formed the very substance of rabbinic thought, had not been conceptualized. This applies, in addition to the above named, to concepts like Judaism, chosen people, revelation, immanence, transcendence, immortality, etc. Instead of justifying the absence of these concepts on "logical" grounds, it is sufficient to note that rabbinic thought had not evolved all the abstract terms necessary for adequate religious purposes. As an example of the "violence" done to rabbinic thought by treating an auxiliary idea as if it were an idea in itself, Kadushin cites the parallel between the soul and God drawn by the midrash to Psalm 103.1. "Modern scholars," he writes, "with their philosophic bias, often point to this midrash as an expression of the Stoic doctrine that God is the soul of the universe." Among these scholars he names Schechter, whom he generally follows with utmost reverence. "Does this passage," Kadushin demands, "actually compare God to the soul of the world? Supposing the passage to contain this idea, is it the theme of the midrash? We take the theme to be that it is appropriate for the soul to praise God, a theme involving the concept of prayer, and we regard the idea of God filling the world, or His omnipresence, as an auxiliary idea" (p. 222). Having demoted the idea to the rank of an "auxiliary," has Kadushin done away with the parallel between the soul and God? Furthermore, the parallel is developed in passages that do not refer to prayer at all, as in Deut. R. 2.37. Judging by the numerous occasions in which the idea is utilized, we may conclude that the rabbis considered it quite important and that it is not to be ruled out from the sphere of rabbinic theology on the ground of a hypothetical classification. The proof text used in most of the midrashic variants on this theme, Jeremiah 23.24, "Do I not fill heaven and earth," appears in numerous other connections which can only be taken as teaching not only divine omnipresence but immanence. Kadushin takes pains to rule out the entire concept of immanence from rabbinic theology. The issue obvi-</page><page sequence="6">THE RABBINIC MIND-COHON 249 ously hinges on the right definition of the term. He observes: "If 'immanence of God' means that God is present within men or within any place as a kind of permanent inherent principle, we have to do with an idea foreign to rabbinic thought, with a philosophic conception" (p. 255). The presence of the above cited parallel between the soul and God runs counter to Kadushin's view. True, the rabbis do not draw all possible conclusions from that parallel, and thus avoid the danger of Stoic pantheism. But they affirmed with Nehemiah 9.6 that God is not only the creator of heaven and earth but that He also animates and preserves them. However, Kadushin's definition of the term is not the only one. A. C. McGiffert, in the article "Immanence," in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religions and Ethics, vol. VII, p. 172, comments that common as it is, immanence is seldom clearly conceived or carefully defined. "With most," he says, "it is hardly more than an instinctive protest against traditional mechanical and external notions of the relation of nature and the supernatural, or against the deistic banish- ment of God from the world and from human life." Funk and Wag- nall's New Standard Dictionary defines the term, as used in theology, in these words: "the essential presence of God in all the universe and yet, as personal being, to be distinguished from it." While the terms immanence and transcendence derive from the vocabulary of philosophy, the ideas which they represent are deeply imbedded in both biblical and rabbinic theology. In addition to Jer. 23.24, we may point to Isa. 6.3, Amos 9.2-4 and Psalm 139.7 ff., as examples of immanence or omnipresence in the Bible. Instead of con- ceiving of God as remote and inapproachable, Judaism learned to view Him as both high, mysterious and holy and also as near to the lowliest of men (Isa. 57.15; Psalm 113.5). He is near to all who call upon Him in truth (Psalm 145.18). In the words of the rabbis: "He is near in all kinds of nearness" (Yer. Ber. 9.1). In discussing Genesis R. 68.9, Kadushin recognizes the idea of im- manence in the rabbinic appellation makom for God, but he adds: "It is not a passage on the Shekinah" (p. 256). How does that affect the presence of the idea of immanence in rabbinic theology? As to the term Shekinah, it must be noted (as Kadushin recognizes) that it denotes different things in different places. In some instances it unmistakably points to immanence. For example Tanluma (old), Vayakhel, 7, discussing the name of Bezalel, uses the proof text from Jer. 23.24, and cites R. Levi's parable of the cave situated near the sea. As the tide rises, the cave is filled with water, without depleting the sea.</page><page sequence="7">250 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW So the Shekinah concentrated itself in the tabernacle and in the ark (as in Ex. 40.34 and Josh. 3.11) without diminishing the Divinity in heaven and earth (Ps. 148.18; Comp. Num. R., Naso 12.4; Midrash Psalms 24.1). Present everywhere in the universe, God is nearest to man. "Wherever thou findest the footprints of man there I am before thee" (Mek., Vayyasa', 7). In the words of R. Gamliel, there is no place on earth empty of the Shekinah (Pes. 2b). Wherever men gather for prayer or for study, the Shekinah is present. While, as Kadushin observes, the Shekinah is not "a residing principle within Israel," it follows the people into all the lands of their wanderings and shares in their afflictions. On the one hand, the Shekinah is repelled by the people's sins, and, on the other, dwells with them even in their un- cleanness (Mek. Pisha, 14). Kadushin asks with regard to the discussion of the appellation "makom" in Gen. R. 68.9: "Were these statements, which are not very clear, influenced by the philosophical conception of immanence?" and replies: they may have been, but if so, the figure with which the passage closes shows that the idea of immanence was soon eliminated." In proof he refers to the parable of R. Abba bar Judan, drawn from Hab. 3.8, regarding the hero riding on a horse, and commenting that the horse is secondary to the rider, not the rider to the horse (P. 257). Kadushin fails to note that in rabbinic as in biblical theology, imma- nence combines with transcendence. Hence, R. Abba's parable is not a retraction of immanence but a natural complement to it. Kadushin characterizes his work as a psychological study of rabbinic Judaism (p. 10). This is its nature in so far as it concerns itself with the kind of ideas and the types of concepts underlying the aggada and the halaka. This concern, however, with rabbinic ideas and concepts places his study - much against his will - within the realm of rudi- mentary philosophy. His inhibition against rational interpretations and against seeking the origins of religious ideas impairs his efforts. Does his insistence that in rabbinic Judaism as in the Bible we have an "experience of God rather than a God concept" (p. 300), account for the monotheistic faith of Judaism? Experience of God led many other peoples of anitiquity to polytheism. How, then, did it happen to lead Israel to monotheism? And why did the attributes of justice and love come to play so important a role in rabbinic Judaism? Kadushin treats rabbinic thought as something virtually static, unaffected by either external or internal developments. He does, however, admit (p. 367) that "it is quite likely that the very crystallization of the</page><page sequence="8">MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE-SILBERSCHLAG 251 rabbinic dogmas was primarily due to the sectarian conflicts of those times." Nevertheless, he does not pursue the matter any farther, and nowhere indicates the possible effects of those conflicts on rabbinic thought as a whole. On the other hand, while opposing the tendency to intellectualize rabbinic thought, Kadushin himself forces it into a modern semantic mould. Though he stresses that the hypotheses of value-concepts and organismic thinking are not contained in rabbinic literature but are his own creation, the effect of his effort amounts to forcing the simple and fluid ideas of the Rabbis into a rigid mould of modern construction. By way of example we may cite his arguments that "the experience of God is associated with the integration of value-concepts" and that "the process of integration of the value-concepts is also the process of integration of the self." "The awareness or experience of God," he concludes, "is thus a phenomenon associated with the integration of the self. What stimulates the awareness of the self also stimulates the experience of God" (pp. 257-8). What Kadushin says about anthropo- morphism applies to his own speculations: "Such problems are not in any sense within the rabbinic universe of discourse not even by impli- cation, and are not to be injected there even for the purpose of analysis" (p. 283).
