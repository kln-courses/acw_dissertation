<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Dog Days Kevin A. Morrison Syracruse University Critics and biographers of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, although rarely invoking Sigmund Freud, often draw loosely on the psychoanalytic cat egory of substitution when recounting key details of her life.1 According to this line of thinking, her brother Edward (or "Bro," as she affectionately called him) constitutes the prototype of every subsequent relationship she entered into after his drowning in 1840 at the age of thirty-three off the southern coast of Devonshire. There is, of course, much evidence for this assertion. Barrett frequently defined her relationship with Bro in terms of harmony and organic wholeness. "There was no harsh word, no unkind look" from her brother throughout her life, she once recounted; "A leaf never shook till the tree fell. The shade was over me softly till it fell."2 The poet considered Bro her "best beloved" and her "first and chiefest affection"; she loved him "best in the world beyond comparison and rivalship" and received from him nothing but "the tenderest affection."3 Hence, critics have repeatedly concluded that in every subsequent relationship, Barrett attempted to find a suitable replacement for the lost object of her affec tions.4 Enter Mary Russell Mitford and her cocker spaniel Flush. Four years before Bro's drowning, Mitford was already providing Barrett with a sound ing board for her ideas and serving as an increasingly significant source of moral and intellectual support. After Bro's death, Mitford was in a position to help Barrett "turn again to life and to high poetic aspirations."5 Dorothy Mermin has pointed out that "Miss Mitford gave her young friend what she needed: flowers, . . . letters full of warmth and affection and the daily bustle of life, and literary encouragement."6 Perhaps the greatest gift that Mitford gave Barrett, however, was the puppy of her own dog, each bear ing the name Flush. Margaret Forster remarks that "Mitford empathised completely with [Barrett's] anguish" over Bro's death and believed that the cocker spaniel would provide, "if not anything as insulting as distraction, an outlet for her distress, [and] some tangible comfort."7 In such accounts, Flush becomes a substitute for "the tenderest affection[s]" Barrett received from and showered on Bro: "Even when perfectly aware that she was being faintly ridiculous Elizabeth could not restrain herself: all the demonstrative love of which she was capable gushed out over Flush."8 Peter Dally similarly remarks that although her "loss was irreparable" and "no one could take Tulsd Studies in Women's Literature, Vol. 30/ No. 1 (Spring 2011)/ pp. 93-115. © University of Tulsd/ 2011. All rights to reproduction in any form are reserved.</page><page sequence="2">Bro's place," Barrett "now had a companion who spent much of his time on her bed."9 Flush, on the one hand, is often figured by biographers as bestow ing physical affection on and generating much amusement for Barrett. Mitford, on the other hand, is often seen as drawing out Elizabeth's poetic sensibilities, which prepares her to enter her union with Robert Browning on an equal literary footing. Both helped to ease Barrett's pain. When she meets and ultimately marries Robert Browning, the chain of substitutions is both extended and completed. According to Dally, "Elizabeth knew for certain that Robert could combine the roles of teacher and companion, and become the person for whom she had long held 'blind hopes', who could stand in place of Bro, and provide the mental stimulation she so much lacked" (p. 101). Unlike Mitford and Flush, it seems, who are at best par tial replacements, Robert is a condensation of both, uniting in one person all the qualities and characteristics Barrett previously associated with her brother. These biographical accounts have inevitably shaped the way we read Barrett Browning's poems about Flush, reflecting, as they seem to do, largely commonplace ideas of a dog's unconditional love, loyalty, and steadfastness to its owner.10 The poems have come collectively to signify Barrett's rela tionships with Mitford and Flush as intermediary or transitional and to stand as symbols of the comfort she received from them during a period of pronounced depression. Perhaps one reason for the discomfort evinced by critics and biographers alike over Barrett's attachment to Flush, and hence the frequent dismissal of the poems as unexceptional lyrics, is that adults who have intense and sustained emotional ties to animals cannot be posi tively accounted for in psychoanalytic theory. In classical psychoanalysis theory, adult attachments to a love object are understood to be normal when they are between two culturally sanctioned subject positions: male and female. The reproductive capacity of that relationship is key to its normality. The point of proper objects, after all, is to make us recognizable subjects. One of the problems with the idiom of classical psychoanalysis, even if it is only rudimentarily deployed in the biographies that I have just cited, is its inability to account for relationships outside these parameters.11 As Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have argued, the cultural machine of psy choanalysis insists on seeing affection as substitution within an Oedipalized framework.12 The only legitimate, legible, and codified relationships are those that are mappable onto a human, and indeed distinctly reproduc tive, grid.13 However, the Oedipal notion of substitutive love obscures the unmappable relationships with which these poems are concerned: that is, Barrett's ties to Flush and her epistolary friendship with Mitford. In fact, the tendency to see Flush as a substitute for Bro ignores both the 94 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="3">prominent role that the cocker spaniel plays in the expressions of love between Mitford and Barrett and the specificity of the human and nonhu man animal relationship. In contrast to the logic of substitution, therefore, I want to argue for the more flexible and nonteleological notion of the supplement. I suggest that Barrett Browning conceives of love as initially involving both substitution and accretion before it evolves toward a unique specificity. What I wish to call supplementary love undermines the logic of substitution that has governed biographical accounts of her life. My essay proceeds in two parts. In the first section, I contend that the emotional intensity of Barrett and Mitford's relationship is largely transacted through Flush. The unorthodox intimacy and kinship between women of different generations is displaced onto the equally unorthodox relationship they have to their respective cocker spaniels. Yet, as I go on to suggest, Barrett refuses the proposition that Flush is merely a stand-in for the geographically distant Mitford, whose ministrations are themselves often seen by critics and biographers as a replacement for Bro's affections. Flush emerges as a subject to be loved in his own right. In the second sec tion, I situate two of Barrett Browning's poems, "To Flush, My Dog" (1843) and "Flush or Faunus" (1850), within the larger context of her struggle with the epistemology and the phenomenology of love in order to demonstrate how the poems grapple with new ways of conceiving relations between human and nonhuman animals in terms of reciprocity and relationality.14 II Introduced by the writer John Kenyon in 1836, Mitford and Barrett were immediately captivated with each other. Both Barrett and her father had long admired Mitford's Our Village: Sketches of Rural Life and Scenery, a series of literary essays on the English countryside published in biennial volumes between 1824 and 1832, as well as her famously steadfast devo tion to her ailing, invalid father, with whom she lived at Three Mile Cross, Berkshire. When Kenyon arranged for the two to spend an afternoon at the Diorama and Zoological Gardens in London, the nearly starstruck Barrett "spent the morning walking up and down the house, too agitated to read or write."15 As soon as they met, Barrett took Mitford into her confidence as a friend and, especially, as a literary guide. In her sonnet "Mary Russell Mitford in Her Garden," Barrett contrasts her own verse with that of her mentor's, "in whose dear writings drops the dew / And blow the natural airs": What time I lay these rhymes anear thy feet, Benignant friend, I will not proudly say As better poets use, "These flowers I lay," Because I would not wrong thy roses sweet, Blaspheming so their name.16 95</page><page sequence="4">Refusing to equate her rhyme with the beautiful and natural profusion of flowers in the garden, she nevertheless notes the tenderness with which Mitford approaches both. In the sonnet, Mitford, whose love of gardening surpasses all other pleasures, is portrayed as saying Low-rooted verse may reach some heavenly heat, Even like my blossoms, if as nature-true Though not as precious, (p. 52) For Barrett, however, the real comparison is between Mitford's sunny out look, in its nurturing fullness, and the natural world itself: "thou, who art next I To nature's self in cheering the world's view" (p. 52). Mitford, in turn, is instantaneously captivated by the younger woman's beauty and literary potential. Recounting her first impression of Barrett in Recollections of a Literary Life, she writes: "Of a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on either side of a most expressive face, large tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, a smile like a sunbeam"— echoing the natural imagery Barrett uses in the poem cited above—"and such a look of youthfulness."17 The two soon began a largely epistolary friendship that would last for nearly twenty years. At the time of their ini tial correspondence, Barrett was thirty and still struggling to write poetry. Mitford, at the age of forty-nine, had already achieved success as a writer of literary sketches and dramatic literature. Finding her career increasingly on the wane, Mitford could devote much of her energy to encouraging her protégée. The intense emotional intimacy they achieved, perhaps because of and not despite the epistolary medium, is evinced in the sheer range of topics they discussed: politics, gossip, literature, various physical ailments, love, and loss. "To no other correspondent," Meredith B. Raymond and Mary Rose Sullivan point out, does Barrett tell so much about her remorse over Bros death and its effect on her already complex relationship with her father; her fascination with George Sand as a writer and a woman; . . . her chafing at the overbearing behavior of a visitor, and hopeful suitor, Rev. George B. Hunter; and her appetite for sensational French novels and for gossip about the marriage prospects of Home, Kenyon, and Tennyson.18 Through letters addressed to each other as "dearest" and "darling," as well as gifts, including a "precious ringlet" of Mitford's hair mailed to Barrett at her request, the two strengthened their intellectual and emotional ties.19 Following Bro's drowning, Mitford was one of the few who could pen etrate the shroud of grief that enveloped Barrett.20 A continual stream of flowers flowed into Torquay, where Barrett was convalescing, from Mitford's garden in Berkshire. "My dear Love," Mitford addresses her, "Oh, how I wish we could transport you into the garden where they grow!"21 96 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="5">These were flowers about which Barrett often thought she should "sing instead of say,"22 as she does in "A Flower in a Letter": By Loddon's stream the flowers are fair That meet one gifted lady's care With prodigal rewarding: (For Beauty is too used to run To Mitford's bower—to want the sun To light her through the garden).23 Mitford's bouquets were, in fact, the only ones Barrett admitted to her room: "I have looked at them &amp; seen you in them, &amp; borne for your sake that some of them shd be put into a vase in my room."24 The flowers serve here as metonyms for Mitford herself; Barrett declares, "There have been no more flowers in my room [since Bro's death a year earlier] until now. . . . I denied nature, but could not deny you!" (1:274). To Mitford, Barrett insists, she owed "a new spring" (1:274). With that fresh season came a return to verse. Throughout the period of Barrett's convalescence, Mitford continued to nurture her younger friend's poetic sensibilities: "My love and my ambition for you often seems [sic] to be more like that of a mother for a son, or a father for a daughter (the two fondest of natural emotions), than the common bonds of even a close friendship between two women of different ages and similar pursuits. . . . It is a strange feeling, but one of indescribable pleasure."25 In her gloss on this passage, Marjorie Stone remarks that "Mitford . . . played a vital role in fostering Barrett's ambition—in effect, 'mothering' the poet's mind . . . as the Brownings later did for each other" (p. 24).26 With her usual acu ity, Stone emphasizes how, in contradistinction to the prevalent scholarly assumption, "Mitford significantly contributed to [the renaissance of verse in Elizabeth's life] well before Barrett ever met Browning" (p. 25). By using the term "mothering," however, to signify less the "oceanic feelings" that psychoanalysis ascribes to the bond between mother and child than a transitional phase of preparation for Barrett's later marriage to Robert, Stone inadvertently reinforces a teleological Oedipal narrative: Mitford prepares Elizabeth to enter into a reciprocal relationship with Robert. However, Mitford's appeal to the "natural emotions" of a father or mother in articulating her own understanding of that relationship is suggestive of the conceptual difficulties that women often faced in articulating such a "strange" but indescribably pleasurable bond. The familial idiom was one way of framing forms of companionship and kinship that flourished outside of normative strictures and regulating categories. Barrett repeatedly struggles with the question of how to account for her relationship with Mitford. When Mitford suggests that, after Bro's drown ing, Barrett could turn to the large network of family and friends around 97</page><page sequence="6">her for support, she replies, "True that I have still a broad circle of family affection,—even now—even with these gaps in it—the dearest of the dearest [Bro] away!—but how wrong you wd be, how you wd wrong me, should you suppose for such a reason that I cd love you less."27 Members of the family have been looking after her, Barrett acknowledges, but this fact does not immediately translate into emotional intimacy or psychological comfort. She tells Mitford, "What heaps of cousins &amp; uncles &amp; aunts I have, whom, for love's sake, I shd be ashamed to mention in the same page with you .... Hearts wont branch out after the pattern of genealogical trees" (1:265). How, then, to describe this relationship that supercedes familial ties? Unlike Mitford, who draws on the familial idiom, Barrett figures their bond as indefinable: "You hold a place all to yourself in my affection &amp; power of appreciation, dear in a manner peculiar" (1:265). Although this sentence would seem to invite a symptomatic reading, the term "peculiar" may be seen to register the individuality or particularity of their relationship for which the familial idiom and notions of substitutive love are inadequate. Critics have found it difficult to appreciate the peculiarity of Mitford and Barrett's relationship on its own terms, as they themselves have noted, without immediately describing it as transitional; it seems to me that this difficulty is in part because of the prominent role Flush played in their lives. A large percentage of Barrett and Mitford's correspondence, much to the bemusement and embarrassment of critics and biographers alike, is devoted to the cocker spaniel's various exploits. These seemingly trivial and superficial discussions do not fit within the current understanding of Barrett Browning as a serious poet and thinker who tackled complex philo sophical and social issues. Additionally, the shared pet was often central to female marriages and romantic friendships. The relationships of Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper and of Emma Stebbins and Charlotte Cushman are just two of many in which a pet dog was central.28 As such, any con sideration of the triangulated relationship of Barrett, Mitford, and Flush would detract from the spectacular love story of Elizabeth and Robert with which so much criticism is invested. While the relationship of Mitford and Barrett is certainly not comparable to Bradley and Cooper's or Stebbins and Cushman's, it does evince a kind of intense emotional intimacy that has caused some critics at least to pause and note its contours. Martha Vicinus has suggested that "Barrett Browning's long-standing friendship with Mary Mitford did not threaten the status quo; she could pour her emotions onto paper without any threatening physical proximity."29 For Vicinus, in other words, the precariousness of the relationship is measured by its physicality. While Barrett and Mitford's relationship was largely epistolary, owing to ill health and geographical separation, the difficulty of navigating their "peculiar" intimacy nevertheless persisted. They frequently displace their 98 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="7">feelings onto Flush, who becomes the means by which to negotiate their bond, with Barrett repeatedly describing Flush as a stand-in for or constant reminder of Mitford. Although reluctant to take on the responsibility of raising Flush so soon after Bro's death, Barrett warmed to the idea. Contemplating Flush's arrival at Torquay, Barrett insists to Mitford that "he is sure to be loved" the moment he arrives: "The logic is so strong!—There is no escape from the conclusion of love."30 At least initially, however, the "logic" of love seems to figure Flush as a kind of replacement for the absent Mitford: "I must love him, coming from you—pretty or not—ears or not! The love is a certainty whatever the beauty may be—and if I am to see in his eyes, as you say, your affectionate feelings towards me, why the beauty must be a certainty too."31 In one of her lengthy letters to Mitford about Flush, Barrett exclaims after he had settled in with her: "If many of my thoughts end in you, this of Flush must. How he makes me think of you! How every pleasure he gives me, is one drawn from you! How I love him for your sake!—which is the sure way of loving him dearly."32 Recounting Flush's arrival, Barrett enthuses to Mitford: "The first person who comes to wake me in the morning is Flush,—to wake me &amp; remind me of you!"33 Dog love, then, serves as a means of expressing same-sex intimacy: I dreamt of you two or three nights ago. Is it strange that I shd dream of you? Yes—because for very very long, it is strange whenever I dream pleasantly. ... I have no sunshine in sleep—nothing but broken hidious [sic] shadows .... But two or three nights ago I dreamt of you . . dreamt of seeing you at Three Mile Cross [Mitford's home]. I was there . . in your sitting room . . and what do you think I did? Sate down on your sofa, drawing up my feet beside me in my old lazy way (how impudent!-—) and then said . . . "Now let us talk about FLUSH".!!! I dont deserve to dream of you.34 Here Mitford is described, much as she is in Barrett's poems, through a nat uralistic idiom, as a harbinger of light that keeps the nightmares at bay and enables Barrett to dream. Yet her solacing presence in Barrett's life is soon displaced onto Flush: "'Now let us talk about FLUSH'.!!!" As the means of expressing the deeply felt bond the two had forged, Flush also becomes a way of talking about the physicality of love. Barrett asks Mitford, "Does little Flush keep close to you? My Flush never sees me shed tears without running to kiss me &amp; rub his little brown ears against my face."35 The dog's comforting touch is immediately attributed to Mitford; she continues, "He learnt love from you. There is no wonder that he shd be complete in his lesson. Believe, my beloved friend, how near I am to you in thought, in prayer, in sympathy of tender affection" (2:117). If each of their Flushes keeps close to them, then they will both have a physical reminder of the emotional proximity they have themselves achieved. Dog love is a symbol 99</page><page sequence="8">of the emotional propinquity between women that redefines notions of kinship as well as significant otherness. Over time, however, Barrett's letters increasingly reflect on the unique and specific nature of her relationship to Flush by no longer figuring him as a proxy for her distant friend. Her attempts to describe the precise nature of that bond, as critics have uncomfortably noticed, are somewhat over the top.36 Barrett confides to Mitford: "My Flush is very fond of pity .... Who says that vanity, coquetry &amp; affectations are peculiar to our humanity?— I dont, since I know Flush."37 As an example of the dog's "pleasure at being praised," Barrett notes that he will "hold his head still, &amp;. his mouth half open, for minutes, until you have exhausted your admiration on his teeth" (2:259). Besides his vanity, Flush apparently insists on eating as his owner does: Did I ever tell you how he was once affronted by a piece of raw meat being thrown at him in charity? Why if his chicken &amp; partridge are not cut up infinitesimally, he turns away his head &amp; wont touch anything on the plate! My Flush is creme de la creme!—What!—eat a rabbit? uncooked? in the fields?—My Flush wdnt eat even his favourite diet, spunge cake, out of doors.38 Fully domesticated to the point of ludicrous refinement and adhering to daily routine, Flush even seems to have been partial to finishing his meals with dessert: "They have brought me a strawberry cream ice,—&amp; Flushie has been helping me to eat it. Oh! he likes it very much indeed."39 In the evenings, the two would always retire together to the bedroom. "We are great friends," she tells Mitford, recounting the many ways in which she and the cocker spaniel understand each other.40 Barrett's letters, in fact, often insist on the unswerving loyalty of her nonhuman companion: "To the rest of the household he is decidedly hostile—will scarcely bestow a mark of courtesy upon either of my sisters, runs away from my brothers, &amp; is coldly disdainful to one little page who has done everything possible to please him" (1:213). All he lacks is a recognizable language with which to communicate and, at times, Barrett is not so sure even of this lack: "He is however, I think, trying to speak .... already he deals in all sorts of inar ticulate sounds—low &amp; not inharmonious for the most part."41 In psychoanalytic terms, Barrett's statements demonstrate the overesti mation of the object, in which owners ascribe selfless and beneficent moti vations to a pet and then tautologically see those qualities confirmed when the animal responds to their physical state or body language. Marjorie Garber observes that this transformation of an animal into a human sub stitute is "more often than not" associated with "women and gay men."42 She writes, "The spectacle of an adult person, male or female, whose chief emotional ties are with a pet animal tends to elicit from many observers responses ranging from pity to condescension" (p. 135). Among critics and biographers, the lure of figuring the relationship with Flush in similar terms 100 TSWL, 30.1, Sprins 2011</page><page sequence="9">has been great given the length and severity of Barrett's depression. Forster, for example, repeats the views of various members of the Barrett family, largely without comment, that Elizabeth's activities with Flush—attempt ing to teach him arithmetic by holding up pieces of cake and counting or reading to him in the hopes that he might begin to recognize printed words on the page—represented the outer limits of sanity, while literary critics have alternately referred to the sonnet "Flush or Faunus" as "strange" or, in an attempt to explain its "oddness" away, as a veiled representation of Robert Browning.43 I want to suggest that what accounts for the shift in Barrett's correspon dence, from describing Flush primarily as a transitional object to a subject in his own right, is the logic of supplementarity. To be fair, psychoanalysis itself does not necessarily see an opposition between a logic of substitution and a recognition of subjects in and of themselves, but the very term "sub stitute" does imply a less than full appreciation for the unique specificity of a given love object. Substitution figures love objects as complementary. By contrast, supplementarity, which involves both substitution and accretion, requires an acknowledgment of that which, by virtue of its foreignness, exceeds the other—opening up possibilities for mutual transformation. In Of Grammatology, Jacques Derrida defines the supplement as both a replacement and an addition: "The supplement adds itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude .... But the supplement supple ments. It adds only to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void.... its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness."44 For Derrida, the ratio of the substitute to the surplus is impossible to fix; supplementarity is thus necessarily inde terminate. As we have seen in Barrett's letters, love is figured by her as initially both substitutive and accretive; Flush functions, on the one hand, as the means of representing her relationship to Mitford while, on the other hand, increasingly becoming a figure who supplements it. Writing to Mitford, she declares: "there is nothing to be done but... to love him at all moments, for your sake, until we reach the 'inherent merit,' the loveability for his own."45 Unlike Derrida, therefore, she suggests that indeterminacy gives way to a unique specificity—what she calls here the "inherent merit" of individual love objects. In her letters to Mitford, Barrett begins to for mulate the notion of "inherent merit" by refusing to define her friend and interlocutor according to familiar (and familial) tropes: "dear in a manner peculiar." She develops this notion of inherent merit more fully in her writings on Flush. As with the embarrassment with which scholars once approached Sonnets from the Portuguese, seeing them as, in Mermin's summation of this view, "awkward, mawkish, and indecently personal," it has been difficult for critics to recognize any linguistic or theoretical complexity in Barrett 101</page><page sequence="10">Browning's many references to Flush.46 Might we read these scattered writings on the topic, especially her poems, as themselves attempting to articulate a theory of love rather than illustrating certain psychoanalytic concepts—ones that would provide an explanation for seemingly irrational behavior? In fact, Virginia Woolf speculated long ago on the co-constitu tive relationship between Barrett Browning and Flush: Heavy curls hung down on either side of Miss Barrett's face; large bright eyes shone out; a large mouth smiled. Heavy ears hung down on either side of Flush's face; his eyes, too, were large and bright: his mouth was wide. There was a likeness between them. As they gazed at each other each felt: Here am I—and then each felt: But how different! Hers was the pale worn face of an invalid, cut off from air, light, freedom. His was the warm ruddy face of a young animal; instinct with health and energy. Broken asunder, yet made in the same mould, could it be that each completed what was dormant in the other? She might have been—all that; and he—But no. Between them lay the widest gulf that can separate one being from another. She spoke. He was dumb. She was woman; he was dog.47 Woolf's representation of the moment of introduction between the ailing Barrett and the eager pup thus captures an initial sense of possibility—of a reciprocity across the species divide that acknowledges both sameness and difference. What distinguishes Woolf's "biography" of Flush, despite her later disavowal of it as "that silly book," is that she, following Barrett Browning, takes seriously the necessity of questioning the hierarchy of human over nonhuman animal.48 Woolf's Flush has been seen, however, not so much as genealogically connected to Barrett Browning in the urgency with which it explores aspects of the creaturely, but as a prototypi cally modernist reassessment of the Victorian period.49 That is to say, all the insight is ascribed to Woolf and none to Barrett Browning. Ill I want now, by turning to two of Barrett Browning's poems, "To Flush, My Dog" and "Flush or Faunus," to look more closely at how she develops what I am calling supplementary love. Autobiographical in irreducible ways, these poems help us to see what she imagines to be the effects of the trans formative power of love untethered from regulating categories of gender, sexuality, and species. "To Flush, My Dog" begins with a burst of affection: Loving friend, the gift of one Who her own true faith has run Through thy lower nature, Be my benediction said With my hand upon thy head, Gentle fellow-creature!50 102 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="11">The higher nature of Mitford's "own true faith," running.through the "lower nature" of the cocker spaniel, elevates Flush from the status of animal to that of "gentle fellow-creature" and "loving friend." The "sleek curls" of Flush's coat, with their "burnished fulness," remind the speaker of "a lady's ringlets brown"—as much a reference to Mitford with her noted curls as to Barrett herself, who, as Woolf depicts it, bore a resemblance to her canine companion (p. 163). Thus, at least initially, Flush appears in the poem as a "love-link," serving a facilitative function for Barrett's emotional expres sions toward an absent mentor and a lost brother.51 Barrett herself conveys an awareness of Flush's function, noting how immediately responsive the animal is to her emotional distress: And if one or two quick tears Dropped upon his glossy ears Or a sigh came double, Up he sprang in eager haste, Fawning, fondling, breathing fast, In a tender trouble, (p. 163) Assuming the role of emotional caretaker, a position previously held by Bro during Elizabeth's convalescence in Torquay and partially filled by Mitford, Flush might be seen here as a substitute for the object of lost or distant affections—that is, Barrett's deceased brother, for whom she grieves, with her tears dropping on Flush's "glossy ears," and Mitford, for whose tender ness and affection she yearns. The shadow of these presences in the poem, however, quickly fades as the speaker begins to particularize the relationship between the human and nonhuman animal. At least initially, the speaker is remarkably interested in the corporeality of her canine companion and expresses that interest by deploying tropes of difference and otherness. Taking joy in the canine's frenetic activity, the speaker exclaims: Leap! thy broad tail waves a light, Leap! thy slender feet are bright, Canopied in fringes; Leap! those tasselled ears of thine Flicker strangely, fair and fine Down their golden inches, (p. 163) Flush's mobility, which the ailing Barrett lacks, is not the reason that Flush is praised: "Yet, my pretty, sportive friend, / Little is't to such an end / That I praise thy rareness" (p. 163). Instead the poem repeatedly speaks of Flush's capacity for love and emotional acuity in ways that tend to deem phasize the physical differences between human and nonhuman animals established in the lines quoted above. Here Flush, whose love outlasts the lives of cut flowers, rises almost to the level of abstraction, acquiring an illuminative power: 103</page><page sequence="12">Roses, gathered for a vase, In that chamber died apace, Beam and breeze resigning; This dog only, waited on, Knowing that when light is gone Love remains for shining, (p. 163) Flush becomes what Cary Wolfe and Jonathan Elmer would call a "human ized animal," or a pet, made possible through Mitford's "own true faith" running through the dog's "lower nature."52 The discourse of exceptional ism, which characterizes the economy of the pet, becomes a way to estab lish proper or socially acceptable relations with nonhuman beings. Indeed, an individual's relationship to a pet differs from one's relation ship toward nonhuman animals in general. As Marc Shell points out, family pets are exceptional in that they are figured as "familial kin."53 In singling out Flush for distinction, the speaker notes: Other dogs in thymy dew Tracked the hares and followed through Sunny moor or meadow; This dog only, crept and crept Next a languid cheek that slept, Sharing in the shadow, (p. 163) Here the meter of the stanza perfectly mirrors its content. The long vowel sounds and smooth consonants of the three lines preceding the semicolon advance at a brisk pace as the speaker describes the generality of animals. That speed is interrupted, however, by the abrupt adjectival "this" and further slowed by the harder consonant sounds that make up the phrase "crept and crept." The meter becomes more measured, in other words, as the speaker lavishes praise on a particular animal, the pet. Standing as the exception or the rareness of which the poem speaks, the pet is exempted from the human/animal binary and ideologically conceived as endowed with human-like features or qualities such as steadfastness and devotion. Dismissing Barrett Browning's emphasis on Flush's likeness to herself as merely (and narcissistically) anthropomorphic would, of course, be easy. In this view, the only appropriate response to nonhuman otherness is to revel in alterity. Often code for sentimentality, the charge of anthropomorphism can, however unwittingly, actually reinforce the notion of human excep tionalism. As Diana Fuss observes, "Sameness, not difference, provokes our greatest anxiety (and our greatest fascination) with the 'almost human,"' and "whenever we are called to become 'more human' we are reminded that the human is never adequate to itself."54 In other words, foregrounding similarities between human and nonhuman animals undermines the pri macy accorded to the former and suggests that the latter can, by embody 104 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="13">ing idealized qualities and characteristics, be more human than humans themselves.55 There is a long tradition of writing about domestic animals, frequently dismissed by critics today for its sentimental projections of human emo tions, that, in highlighting similarities between pet and owner, call into question the delimited and supposedly self-evident category of human.56 "To Flush, My Dog," as well as the sonnet "Flush or Faunus," which follows by a few years, move beyond the category of the pet in order to give a dif ferent valence to the human/nonhuman animal relationship. These poems stress not just similarity but also difference before finally gesturing toward relationality and reciprocity. Barrett Browning's effort to conceive of her relationship to Flush in terms of significant otherness is obscured by the familiar images of a dog's staunch fidelity that both poems deploy. Barrett Browning herself understood this problem; Sonnets from the Portuguese is, in part, an attempt to describe love outside of the literary tropes and conven tions that force a feeling into words. While crafting her sonnet sequence within the courtly love tradition, Barrett Browning does not play faithfully by its rules. Blunt rather than coy, the speaker calls on the auditor not to love her for ephemeral aspects of the self: "Do not say," she instructs him in Sonnet XIV, '"I love her for her smile—her look—her way / Of speaking gently.'"57 Even the physical tokens of her affection deny generic expecta tions. The opening of Sonnet XVIII seems to imply that she will make a familiar amatory offering to him: "I never gave a lock of hair away / To a man, Dearest, except this to thee" (p. 218). Yet, this lock of hair, it turns out, has an association with a love just as strong—that of her mother, who has since passed away: I thought the funeral-shears Would take this first, but Love is justified,— Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years, The kiss my mother left here when she died. (p. 218) Like Flush, in whom traces of Mitford remain even as the relationship develops toward a unique specificity, the precious gift the speaker offers to the auditor also signifies another bond—that between a daughter and her deceased mother. Displacement is clearly operative here, yet in Sonnet XLII, Barrett Browning also insists: I seek no copy now of life's first half: Leave here the pages with long musing curled, And write me new my future's epigraph, New angel mine, unhoped for in the world! (p. 223) The Flush poems, I would suggest, struggle with similar problems: first, how to account for the epistemology of love by recognizing the precise nature 105</page><page sequence="14">of one bond while refusing to see it as either completely substituting for or supplanting another; and second, how to account for the phenomenologi cal experience of love between humans and nonhuman animals on their own terms yet knowing that the full expression remains elusive because it must be depicted in ways that are overly familiar.58 As in "To Flush, My Dog," the speaker of "Flush or Faunus" draws on familiar images of a dog's rareness and emotional perceptiveness. Barrett Browning deifies the canine, however, in an attempt to develop a different vocabulary for describing love across species. She also devises a means of recognizing the specificity of their relationship as something other than or beside that of simply an owner to the thing that is owned: You see this dog; it was but yesterday I mused forgetful of his presence here, Till thought on thought drew downward tear on tear: When from the pillow where wet-cheeked I lay, A head as hairy as Faunus thrust its way Right sudden against my face, two golden-clear Great eyes astonished mine, a drooping ear Did flap me on either cheek to dry the spray! I started first as some Arcadian Amazed by goatly god in twilight grove: But as the bearded vision closelier ran My tears off, I knew Flush, and rose above Surprise and sadness,—thanking the true PAN Who by low creatures leads to heights of love.59 In her "biography" of Flush, Virginia Woolf remarks that this episode between Barrett and her canine was momentarily transformative: "She was lying, thinking; she had forgotten Flush altogether, and her thoughts were so sad that the tears fell upon the pillow. Then suddenly a hairy head was pressed against her; large bright eyes shone in hers; and she started. Was it Flush, or was it Pan?"60 Writing at a time when the excavations at the Herculaneum and Pompeii were uncovering images of physical love between and among different species, Barrett Browning uses the image of Greek and Roman Gods to invert the affective relationship between human and nonhuman animals. Her insistence on the possibility of friend ship across species, expressed by the dog's flapping his ears across her face to dry her tears, is reflected in the mythological figure she uses to represent this relationship: the Greek God Pan and his Roman counterpart Faunus.61 Figuring Flush as one who presides over his flock, Barrett Browning describes the relationship as fundamentally pastoral: "If he sees me cry, he throws himself upon me as consoler general."62 Her moment of reverie, with Flush taking on the qualities of a god who comes to individuals in their sleep, enables Barrett Browning to invert the 106 TSWL, 30.1, Sprins 2011</page><page sequence="15">human and nonhuman animal hierarchy. Whereas speciesism relegates the nonhuman animal to a subordinate role, Barrett Browning elevates the cocker spaniel as if to more fully emphasize his alterity: "Flushie was my Faunus, &amp; powerful for the occasion" (2:316). Woolf captures this moment of inversion and the questions it raises: "Was she no longer an invalid in Wimpole Street, but a Greek nymph in some dim grove in Arcady?" Woolf concludes: "she was a nymph and Flush was Pan."63 If Flush is Pan, however, then the reference to low creatures is not entirely clear. Does our love for animals, representing a lower order than ourselves, lead to the true heights of love? Or are we the lower-order creatures who are enabled to attain those heights? Although at the end of the poem Barrett Browning pulls back from the ultimate implications of these questions, praising the "true Pan" who, through animals, leads humans to experience depths of love, the blurring of the boundaries between humanity and animality— and, indeed, divinity—is suggestive. "To Flush, My Dog" contains a similar ambiguity. As I have noted, the poem vacillates between representing Flush as similar (endowed with human-like qualities) and different. Toward the end of the poem, Barrett Browning replaces both with the notion of reciprocity and responsivity. She and Flush strain beyond their respective limitations in order to mutu ally transform themselves: And because he loves me so, Better than his kind will do Often man or woman, Give 1 back more love again Than dogs often take of men, Leaning from my Human, (p. 164) Referencing both the physical action of bending from a vertical position and the metaphorical act of reaching beyond the human, signified by the capital letter "H," toward some other form of existence, the last line of the stanza complicates any reading of the poem as simply lighthearted fun. To be sure, the speaker's invocation of vertical difference between human and nonhuman animals in the phrase "leaning from my Human" retains a notion of hierarchy. However, it seems to me that this phrase is simply an acknowledgment that inequality inevitably marks any relationship in which one is more dependent on another for care rather than an insistence on humanity's exemption from the web of species dependencies. How else might we account for the repeated refrain of "fellow-creature"?64 Barrett Browning's writings about Flush are both insightful and seri ous because they are contiguous with the larger theoretical concerns about love, kinship, and intimacy that occupy much of her literary and epistolary output. For Barrett Browning, love is a governing force—"The 107</page><page sequence="16">earthly good of this world is its happiness; &amp; its happiness . . . issues from its affections"65—under whose sway, as her letter to Mitford quoted ear lier indicates, come all creatures: "The logic is so strong!—There is no escape from the conclusion of love." So vital for her is the feeling, and the intersubjective relations it grounds, that in her appropriately titled sonnet "Love" she writes: "We cannot live, except thus mutually."66 In this view, life is a domain of entanglement, a space of intra-acting where, to borrow a phrase from Donna Haraway, "becoming is always becoming with."67 Love is what enables a transposition from base life, which is to say mere living or an atomistic struggle for survival, to a meaningful state of being: But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth Throw out her full force on another soul, The conscience and the concentration both Make mere life, Love. ("Love," p. 198) Mutually constitutive relations and the feeling that makes them possible are for Barrett Browning life itself: For Life in perfect whole And aim consummated, is Love in sooth, As Nature's magnet-heat rounds pole with pole. ("Love," p. 198) There is every reason for us to take Barrett's writings about Flush as exten sions of these philosophical preoccupations and as precursors to her more well-known poems. IV The tendency among contemporary critics to associate Victorian women writers with the conventions of mawkish, sentimental anthropomorphism that modernist writers are seen to debunk—the latter group hailed for inau gurating a process of seriously rethinking human and nonhuman animal relations in terms of reciprocity and responsibility with which contempo rary critics align themselves—forestalls any real analysis of how Victorian women writers themselves, and Barrett Browning in particular, actively inquired into the epistemology and phenomenology of love. This sharp bifurcation also enables critics to bypass the ways in which such inquiries, extending to relationships across the species divide, were as likely to fash ion a welcomed ontological insecurity—"leaning from my Human"—as to establish its obverse. What Barrett Browning seems to grasp, as reflected in the chiasmus of "To Flush, My Dog" (Flush straining beyond animal ity, Barrett Browning leaning from her human), is that the category of the human, much like the animal, is not fixed; rather, what gets to count 108 TSWL, 30.1, Sprins 2011</page><page sequence="17">as human and nonhuman is culturally constructed, and the boundaries between the two can, at times, be highly porous. To take seriously the speaker's claim in "To Flush, My Dog," then, requires us to question the cultural processes by which the category of the human comes into existence. One of these processes is substitutive love, which has frequently served as a mechanism for mapping individu als onto a familiar trajectory by charting the subject's development from an early attachment, to a series of replacements with varying degrees of adequacy, to, finally, the closest approximation to the prototypical love object, the spouse. Through the psychoanalytic conception of substitutive love, intense and sometimes excessively emotional and physical relation ships between human and nonhuman animals, and also between women, are understood to be secondary experiences. Yet conceiving of love as primarily substitutive within an Oedipal framework ignores its many forms within and across the species divide. Effacing what Barrett Browning calls the "inherent merit" of individual love objects, the logic of substitution narrowly defines kinship, family, and significant others within human ist and sexually reproductive frameworks. Barrett Browning's notion of supplementarity figures a variety of love relationships as constituting adult experience itself rather than resting stations on the road to maturity and adulthood—a road whose terminus and telos are signified in the cultural imaginary by the term "man and wife." Indeed, she asks us to see affective relationships—such as the bonds between her and Mary Russell Mitford, between her and Flush, or between her and Robert Browning—not as links in a substitutive chain that goes back to a lost primary love but as stages in a continual process of learning how to feel with and for another.68 NOTES I am grateful to Eileen Gillooly, John Glavin, Natalie M. Houston, John O. Jordan, Helena Michie, Meredith Skura, Molly Slattery, and the two exceptional Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature readers for their comments on earlier versions of this essay. 1 In this paper I use the name Elizabeth Barrett Barrett whenever I discuss bio graphical or historical events in the author's life and poems published before 1846, the year that she married Robert Browning. I use Elizabeth Barrett Browning when referring generally to the authorial persona or to poems published after 1846. This is, admittedly, a little unwieldy, but it would be historically imprecise to use a last name she did not assume until 1846. In making this distinction, I follow the lead of Simon Avery and Rebecca Stott in Elizabeth Barrett Browning (London: Longman, 2003). 2 Elizabeth Barrett Barrett to Mary Russell Mitford, 14 June 1841, in The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Mary Russell Mitford, 1836-1854, ed. Meredith B. Raymond and Mary Rose Sullivan, 3 vols.

(London: Murray, 1946), 1:175. Gardner B. Taplin provides the following gloss, which emphasizes Bro's role as an emotional caretaker to Elizabeth: "However much she loved her father, her sisters, and her brothers, she acutely missed the companionship and understanding she received from [Bro]"; see Taplin, The Life of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1957), 80. 4 In his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, trans. James Strachey (New York: Basic Books, 2000), Sigmund Freud argues that one's instincts for pleasure and self preservation become conflated while the child nurses at the mother's breast. As "the child's first and most vital activity," nursing is essential for nourishment, but Freud notices that the child insists on sucking on the breast long after the mother's supply of milk has been depleted (p. 47). He suggests this is evidence that "sexual activity attaches itself to functions serving the purpose of self-preservation" (p. 48). Indeed, he notes, "No one who has seen a baby sinking back satiated from the breast and falling asleep with flushed cheeks and a blissful smile can escape the reflection that this picture persists as a prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life" (p. 48). For Freud, therefore, relationships in one's later adult life are a series of substitutions for the lost object of childhood. Sucking at the mother's breast becomes the prototype, he insists, "of every relation of love," and thus "the finding of an object" in later life "is in fact a refinding of it" (p. 88). Many critics and biographers draw quite loosely on this model to suggest that Bro is the proto type for Barrett's subsequent relationships. 5 Marjorie Stone, Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1995), 24.

Kuzniar argues in her study of human attachments to dogs, "because pet keeping is generally ridiculed as trivial and sentimental, and the animal held to be a lesser being, psychoanalysis has dismissed the powerful implica tions of canine-human relations"; see Kuzniar, Melancholia's Dog: Reflections on Our Animal Kinship (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), 8. 12 Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987). Deleuze and Guattari are not entirely accurate in their assessment of psy choanalysis insofar as they fail to account for either oceanic feelings, which are decidedly not a part of individuated subjectivity because, as some theorists posit, they dissolve the boundaries between subject and object, or various branches of 110 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="19">psychoanalysis, including object-relations psychology. Moreover, their polemi cal attack on pet owners—"anyone who likes cats or dogs is a fool"—suggests that affection for animals entails a kind of fetishistic attachment to the feral (p. 240). The value of their insight, to me, is in seeing how human and nonhuman animal relations become subsumed into an Oedipal narrative, one that tends to discount same-sex friendships or relationships between humans and nonhuman animals. 13 According to Deleuze and Guattari, animals are consistently imagined as play ing familial roles: "individuated animals, family pets, sentimental, Oedipal animals each with its own petty history, 'my' cat, 'my' dog" (p. 240). 14 On Barrett Browning's philosophical explorations of love, see Glennis Stephenson, "Elizabeth Barrett Browning and the Poetry of Love" (PhD diss., University of Alberta, 1988), ProQuest (252085916); and Rebecca Stott, "'How Do I Love Thee?': Love and Marriage," in Avery and Stott, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 134-55.

According to Perry, mothering the mind is associated with and patterned on the beginnings of a life: "An infant first experiences itself in the pres ence of—and in relation to—the mother or primary caretaker who holds it, feeds it, cleans it, and so on. This regular intervention permits the infant the experience ... of a 'self with a past, present and future'"; see Perry's introduction to Mothering the Mind: Twelve Studies of Writers and Their Silent Partners, ed.

Barrett appears to be suggesting that Flush is attempting to acquire human speech rather than using his own system of communication, but she nevertheless acknowledges that his barking and murmuring are something resembling language. In so doing, she moves beyond mere anthropomorphism, in which the cocker 112 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="21">spaniel would be solely a projection of her hopes and fears. Instead, as I will shortly develop, she acknowledges him as a significant other with whom she is engaged in practices of "becoming with"—a phrase used by Donna Haraway to describe the "lively knottings [of interhuman as well as human and nonhuman animal relation ships] that tie together the world"; see Haraway, When Species Meet (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008), vii. 42 Marjorie Garber, Dog Love (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996), 135.

As Tricia Lootens has argued, perhaps the sonnets are embarrassing "because the experience of read ing them reveals the extent to which we, and not they, rely upon dreams of simple, innocently sentimental Victorian love"; see Lootens, Lost Saints: Silence, Gender, and Victorian Literary Canonization (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1996), 120. My argument suggests that this insight can be extended to the Flush poems as well. 47 Virginia Woolf, Flush: A Biography, ed.

Indeed, as Flint dem onstrates in her introduction to Flush, the biography of the cocker spaniel tackles a number of themes that are consistent across Woolf's literary output, making her dismissal of the book somewhat disingenuous (pp. xv-xliv). 49 Through Flush, critics have argued, Woolf takes up issues ranging from canon icity (Caughie), to social marginalization (Flint), to urban life (Faris and Squier), to the human impulse to chronicle individual lives (Griffiths). See Pamela L. Caughie, "Flush and the Literary Canon: Oh where oh where has that little dog gone?"

Subsequent references to this poem will be cited parenthetically in the text. 51 I borrow the phrase "love-link" from an 1827 poem, "Lines to the Memory of a Favourite Dog," anonymously published. At a time when the ideal of domesticity was rapidly ascending in British culture, the pet in this poem is the keeper of the hearth: 113</page><page sequence="22">And all the household love thee,—thou to them Wert as a love-link, a domestic gem; In thee bound up was many a cherish'd thought, And home-sensations by thy sight were brought; As a "love-link," the speaker's pet makes familial cohesion possible. See "Lines to the Memory of a Favourite Dog," Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, October 1827, 439. 52 See Cary Wolfe with Jonathan Elmer, "Subject to Sacrifice: Ideology, Psychoanalysis, and the Discourse of Species in Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs," in Animal Rites: American Culture, the Discourse of Species, and Posthumanist Theory, by Wolfe (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), 101. The concept of the pet has been characterized as a form of speciesist thinking. Peter Singer pro vides the essential definition of speciesism as a bias toward Homo sapiens and against other species in Animal Liberation (New York: Ecco, 2002), 6. As an entity that is owned, a pet plays a subordinate role to the human on whom it relies for care. Keith Thomas argues that the singular pet is distinguished from animals in general on three grounds: the pet is allowed to inhabit the home, is given an individual name, and is never eaten; see Thomas, Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England, 1500-1800 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 112-15. 53 Marc Shell, "The Family Pet," Representations, 15 (1986), 126. 54 Diana Fuss, introduction to Human, All Too Human (New York: Routledge, 1996), 3. 55 Establishing emotional commonalities between human and nonhuman ani mals is not without its difficulties. As Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson points out, "we can never claim that we know precisely what a dog feels"; see Masson, Dogs Never Lie about Love: Reflections on the Emotional World of Dogs (New York: Three Rivers Press, 1998), xvi. However, this is a good deal different from saying that, as Thomas Nagel once contended, any effort to understand the experience of a nonhuman animal is always already anthropomorphic; see Nagel, "What is it Like to be a Bat?" Philosophical Review, 83 (1974), 435-50. On animal emotions more generally, see Marc Bekoff, Minding Animals: Awareness, Emotions, and Heart (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 100-19. 56 Much of this work originated in the eighteenth century. For a general dis cussion of this development, see Laura Brown, Fables of Modernity: Literature and Culture in the English Eighteenth Century (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), especially 227-28. 57 Barrett Browning, "Sonnets from the Portuguese," in The Complete Poetical Works, 217. Subsequent references will be cited parenthetically in the text. 58 Stott has made a compelling case for understanding Barrett Browning's poetry as frequently wrestling with the epistemology of love: "how do we know the loved person; how do we know love . . . see Stott, '"How Do I Love Thee?,"' 135. I would add that the poems are just as concerned with the phenomenology of love: how do we experience it? 59 Barrett Browning, "Flush or Faunus," in The Complete Poetical Works, 196. 60 Woolf, Flush, 27. Barrett's record of the experience is contained in one of her letters to Mitford, 2 October 1843, in The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 2:316: 114 TSWL, 30.1, Spring 2011</page><page sequence="23">[Recently, I sought a] moment of solitude, to cry in it very bitterly. Suddenly a little hairy head thrust itself from behind my pillow into my face, rubbing its ears &amp; nose against me in a responsive agitation, &amp; drying the tears as they came. I had forgotten Flushie, &amp; was startled at the apparition, or rather the sensation, of the hairy head—it was a Faunus or a Pan! In a few moments however, my heart was led away from itself into an assuaging of Flushie, who, if I were determined to cry, was bent upon crying too. 61 Of course, Barrett Browning frequently wrote about Pan to address a range of concerns.
