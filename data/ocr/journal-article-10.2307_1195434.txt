<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? GERALD BIRNEY SMITH University of Chicago One of the fundamental questions being raised by thoughtful people today is concerning the adequacy of the conception of God which finds philosophical expres- sion in theism. This article contains the substance of a paper on the subject read before the Theological Society in New York on April ii, 1925. It attempts to indi- cate some of the reasons why theism no longer possesses a cogent appeal, and to in- dicate an approach to a definition of God more in accordance with the empirical temper of our day. The increasing use of the empirical method in examining the nature of religion has led to certain unforeseen results. The validity of religious doctrines and rites was formerly re- ferred to divine establishment. With a more historically accu- rate understanding of the development of religion, these older sanctions have been replaced by considerations drawn from human experience. Religion has come to stand on its own feet, and to claim recognition because of its intrinsic values. It has not always been recognized that when God is no longer appealed to as the guarantor of religion his place in a religious system is very different from that occupied by him in a religion which refers every item to a divine origin. Religion, it seems, would continue, even if God should cease to play any part in religious thinking. We are thus brought face to face with the question whether, if we interpret religion in experiential, rath- er than theological, terms, such a religion needs inevitably to affirm the existence of God. Is theism essential to religion? It is not an easy matter to determine just what is "essen- tial" to religion. We can point to doctrines which have ulti- mately been abandoned, although these were once declared to be indispensable. The "essentials" of any religion usually turn out to be those tenets and practices which the religious group requires as a condition of membership. The ultimate 356</page><page sequence="2">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 357 test, however, must be found in the actual valuation of the alleged "essentials" in the experience of living persons. If any of these cease to be personally precious, they become mere formalities; and sooner or later in the interests of sincerity a dissenting group will redefine religion so as to omit the items which have no vital meaning. For a person who does not feel the reality of God, the doctrine of God is not a religious es- sential. Instead, then, of starting with an a priori definition of re- ligion and seeking to ascertain whether theism is a necessary factor in that definition, we shall get more directly at the root of the problem if we ask why the present questioning of the theistic hypothesis has arisen. I "Theism is the doctrine that nature has a Creator and Preserver, the nations a Governor, men a Heavenly Father and Judge." Thus Robert Flint defined the term. This defini- tion expressly mentions the three realms in which theistic phi- losophy has been specifically applied. There is, in the first place, a theological explanation of the physical universe; in the second place, a theological theory of political authority; and in the third place a theological interpretation of religious and moral experience. This threefold reference to God still obtains in Roman Catholic theology. "Natural law" is the ex- pression of the divine will. Political authority is derived from God. Personal religion is interpreted against the background of the certainty of the divine judgment, and consists in accept- ing a divinely provided way of salvation. This theological interpretation of the three realms of na- ture, society, and personal life can be readily elaborated into a consistent and intellectually satisfactory philosophy. All problems find their solution in the appeal to the perfect ra- tional and moral character of God. Things which seem to us to be irrational or lacking in moral goodness can be rational-</page><page sequence="3">358 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ized and moralized by translating them into universal princi- ples located in the perfect wisdom and love of God. Theism is absolutely essential to this type of religion. The problems of life are "solved" only as the prior affirmation of divine causality and control is maintained. The Roman Catholic sees clearly that the theological system stands or falls as a whole. He traces a direct line of inevitable philosophical disintegra- tion, starting with the denial of the authority of the church by Luther, followed by denial of the authority of the Bible, lead- ing then to the denial of the divine foundations of political or- ganization, and issuing ultimately in atheism and anarchism. The Catholic remedy for all evils is to return to the scholastic philosophy, which is essentially theological in character. Re- ligion, as the Catholic conceives it, simply cannot exist with- out an all-inclusive doctrine of God. It will help to under- stand the weakening hold of theism today, if we look briefly at the way in which modern thought has broken away from the traditional threefold theological control. i. First in time came the dissolution of the theological theory of politics. That theory was expressed in the doctrine of the divine right of kings. It is still dominant in the Roman Catholic theory of politics, which holds that all authority is from God. But in the experience of modern nations it was found that the doctrine of the divine right of the ruler could be too easily invoked to sustain royal tyranny. The demo- cratic movement which has inspired modern political develop- ment has been based upon the primary tenet of the rights of man. The attainment of these rights has frequently been pos- sible only by a revolution against established political author- ity; and the resisting political regime usually fortified itself by the theological doctrine of divine right. The consequence of the struggle for democratic rights was the secularizing of politics. The example of the United States in demanding a complete separation of church and state has been followed in</page><page sequence="4">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 359 other lands, and seems to be a necessary means of preserving human rights from the encroachments of ecclesiastical con- trol. It should be added that the Great War extinguished in popular thought the last vestiges of belief in the divine guid- ance of nations. Following this actual secularization of government, mod- ern treatises on political science interpret the history and the organization of states in terms of an evolution of human ex- perimentation. The validity of any given form of political or- ganization is never tested by theological principles. Theism has vanished from political philosophy. In terms of practical experience, the secularization of gov- ernment means that citizenship is complete without any dis- tinctively religious requirements. We look back in curious wonder at the time when citizenship was conditioned on church membership. Today we glory in the fact that the athe- ist has just as full political rights as a theist. If, now, in our political practice it makes no essential difference whether one is a theist or not, if one can be a good citizen without believing in God, theism comes to be a matter of taste rather than a fundamental doctrine. 2. The second of the three realms to be secularized was the realm of nature. The outstanding characteristic of mod- ern scholarship is the prevalence of the scientific method. Carefully controlled investigations are yielding an astonish- ing amount of information concerning the universe, and are giving rise to more or less exact formulations. But the success of scientific exploration seems to depend on the concentrated specialization of the field of inquiry. In the place of such uni- versal generalizations as the older "laws of nature" we find the scientists patiently attempting to disentangle the complex knot of factors which go to make up any particular fact. The consequence is the development of a kind of interpretation which flourishes best without the restraining influence of any</page><page sequence="5">360 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION overhead philosophy. Each science must be free to carry on such experiments as have been found to be promising. A the- ological supervision of science is felt to be intolerable. More and more, as empirical science advances, do philo- sophical generalizations seem to be vague and comparatively meaningless. A far greater reality-sense attaches to the lim- ited and specialized conclusions in a narrowly defined field of investigation than to "speculations" concerning reality in gen- eral. It is difficult for the specialized scientific mind to see the need of any such unifying causal principle as was implied by the conception of a theologically derived "natural law." The behavior of forces is frequently "irrational," in the sense that it does not conform to any neat "laws" which a rational mind might be expected to impose. To presuppose any such closed system as is affirmed by theism seems to the scientist to be a pure exercise of the imagination. He cannot discover that the conception of God is of the slightest use in furthering his in- vestigations. The utterances of scientists who are eager to promote har- monious relations between religion and science are instructive on this point. Typically these scientists are careful to define the scope of religion so that it will not in any way interfere with the complete freedom of their science. Science, they de- clare, is concerned solely with the discovery and the interre- lationships of facts. Religion, they insist, has to do with the ideals and the spiritual life of man. In many cases a some- what sharp division is drawn between these two realms. But it is to be noted that scientists generally speak of religion, rather than of God. Their belief in God, in so far as it persists at all, is a rather vague emotional inheritance. The support of theism which comes from the scientists is a somewhat doubt- ful asset. It is often stated in so naive and vulnerable a fash- ion as to lead one to wonder just what the effect will be on critical minds. In the realm of practice, also, the contributions of modern</page><page sequence="6">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 361 science tend to lead men away from an actual use of the theis- tic hypothesis. The amelioration of the conditions of human life is sought by the use of definite remedies for specific evils. There is no single general formula which may be used for all problems. Epidemics are now averted by controlling sources of infection rather than by prayer. Material prosperity is seen to depend on economic factors rather than on generalized moral attitudes. Wrongdoing is being analyzed by the elabo- ration of case studies, and the causes are located in definite physiological or psychical or social conditions, rather than in a general doctrine of sinfulness. Christianity itself is more and more employing specific and individualized remedies for wrongdoing and trouble, rather than any single "plan of sal- vation." In the face of this practical pluralism, the appeal to God occupies a decreasing place in modern religion. The wide- spread decline of the practice of prayer is partly due to the fact that men find their actual salvation by recourse to various non-theological remedies rather than by appeal to a single "first cause." Thus in the interpretation of cosmic forces as well as in the interpretation of political authority, the practical thinking of our age is non-theological. There is no immediate urge which leads men to crave a theistic philosophy. 3. The demand for theism, then, comes to be restricted to personal religious experience. Men can be good citizens with- out appealing to God. They can be good scientists without af- firming theism. Can they be religious without a belief in God? The type of religious experience which we have inherited was based on the prior acceptance of theism. It was taken for granted that God had created the world for man, that he had given a revelation of his will in the Bible, and that he had established a definite "plan of salvation" through which men might be rescued. The rituals and hymns and prayers of the Christian church keep alive in imagination this theistic back- ground of religious experience. It is unquestionably true that</page><page sequence="7">362 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION with rare exceptions Christians feel that a belief in God and a genuine religious experience are indissolubly bound up to- gether. But the same methods of scientific interpretation which eliminated theism from both natural science and social science are making inroads into the realm of personal religion. The psychology of religion has undertaken to examine the content and function of theological ideas, with a view to a more exact definition of religion. But this study discovers that rational- ization is a secondary rather than a primary activity of human life. The fundamental realities in our experience are not ideas, but the primitive, instinctive reactions of the human organism to the stimulus of environment. Thus human life is "original- ly" related to an unrationalized environment rather than to a world of ideas. The new psychology thus cuts the ground from under the older idealistic philosophy, which pictured a universe already existing in terms of rationalized entities and processes. Ideas and theories grow up as a means of consistent and purposeful adjustment to environment. The conception of God, from this point of view, appears as a result of religious experience. In other words, religion exists first; theological ideas are secondary. The study of history discloses the fact that religions have existed without theism. Animism, fetichism, polytheism, fatalism, as well as theism, exist as interpreters of religion. Does religion actually need any one of these? Responding to this psychological and historical analysis of religion, discussions concerning the nature of God in recent years have taken on a distinctively pragmatic aspect. Our right to believe in the existence of God is as a rule frankly based on the assertion that such a belief is demanded by hu- man experience in its fundamental aspects. The line of argu- ment made familiar a generation ago by John Fiske, has re- cently been stated by Dr. William L. Davidson, as follows:</page><page sequence="8">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 363 My position, then, is that God is a necessity of human nature; which means, not only that in Him this natural spiritual want finds satisfaction (which is something), but further, that it never could have arisen apart from Him as objectively existent. In other words, the existence of the Object as real is implied in the actual existence of the want. Just as in the case of hunger, on the lower or animal side of our nature, hunger as a want obviously could not originate save in a living organism whose very existence depends on its being nourished by food and, therefore, presup- poses the real existence of food, so on the higher or spiritual side of our being, the actual fact of our need of God, laid deep in the human consti- tution, implies that God is, as both originating and as satisfying it.J This is the line of argument generally taken by present- day theologians. It represents an attitude quite in keeping with the scientific spirit of our day. It makes the affirmation and the exposition of the conception of God as reasonable an undertaking as the affirmation and interpretation of any sci- entific hypothesis. But if it is to be anything more than a clever tour de force by means of which dawning doubts may be allayed, it involves a closer analysis. And it is this closer analysis which is creating the difficulties in the way of a con- fident affirmation of the theistic hypothesis. "God is a necessity of human nature." So runs the argu- ment. But just what is human nature? It turns out to be a curiously complex affair. While each individual is unques- tionably related to cosmic forces in such a fashion that his life involves a vital co-ordination of organism and environment, and while this co-ordination gives rise to definite theories as to the nature of the environment, it is a well-known fact that theories change. We need only refer to the development of the science of physics in our own day to remind us that what at one time is regarded as an ontological ultimate may be disin- tegrated with the further progress of investigation and experi- ment. If the functions formerly attributed to God should be so analyzed as to lead us to interpret religion in terms of more readily identifiable stimuli, how much "need" would continue ' Recent Theistic Discussions, T. &amp; T. Clark, 1921, p. 29.</page><page sequence="9">364 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to be felt for God? For many thoughtful persons some such transfer is actually taking place to a considerable extent. The defense of theism which Dr. Davidson proposes seems conclu- sive only to one who still thinks of the world in terms of an idealistic philosophy which posits God as the dynamic source of all reality. If we analyze this alleged need of God in the case of relig- ions other than our own, we come upon a disconcerting dis- covery. Shamash was a very real figure in the religious life of the ancient Babylonians. Doubtless the theologians of that day regarded his existence as absolutely certain. Of the reality of Shamash in Babylonian religious belief there can be no question. But what about the ontological reality of Shamash? In the course of time those religious needs which had been satisfied by Shamash came to be satisfied by more convincing conceptions. We frankly say that Shamash was a symbol of religious hopes rather than an actual deity. It is significant that historical scholars, in interpreting the religion of the Old Testament, usually employ the term "Yahweh" rather than the term "God." This means the recognition that Yahweh be- longs to a stage of religious thinking which we have outgrown. What would a modern theologian say concerning the ontolog- ical reality of Yahweh? Such a study of the history of religions suggests that re- ligion has a way of outgrowing its theologies. Christianity has outgrown many doctrines in the course of the centuries. Is it inconceivable that it should outgrow the traditional doctrine of God? Modern Christian faith has outgrown Calvin's con- ception of a predestinating God. Just what do we mean by "God" anyway? The prevalent ideal of theological toleration is sympto- matic of the changed emphasis in religion. Where the concep- tion of God is most "essential" we have religion in the name of God insisting on conformity to the divinely prescribed doc- trines and rituals. It is only when doctrines are seen to be hu-</page><page sequence="10">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 365 man creations that toleration becomes possible. Modernist Christianity glories in its attitude of toleration. Theology is frankly declared to be a matter of individual conscience. The "essentials" of Christianity are found in certain attitudes and ideals of life rather than in theological doctrines. A certain clergyman in a church which was carrying on an important en- terprise of humanitarian welfare work made an appeal in his sermon for a helper in a day nursery. A young woman pre- sented herself wistfully, remarking that much as she would like to enlist for the work she knew that she would not be ac- cepted. "Why not?" asked the clergyman. "Because I am an atheist," was the reply. "Why should your theology stand in the way of our fellowship in a Christian enterprise?" said the clergyman. Was theism essential to that young woman's re- ligion? How generally would modern Christians approve the attitude of the clergyman? The present-day questioning of theism is due to the fact that we are so largely thinking of religion in terms of itself rather than in terms of theology. When to our secularized pol- itics and our secularized conception of the universe we add the present religious toleration of theological differences, it is no wonder that men are beginning to ask whether the doctrine of God is not too difficult and too vague to furnish the best basis for religion. II Before turning to a consideration of the possibility of so revising the theistic conception as to meet the difficulties which confront thoughtful men, it will be well to look briefly at proposals to organize religious values without resort to theism. Among the most influential leaders of philosophical and social thinking in this country are certain men who distrust any appeal to superhuman forces on the ground that such an appeal weakens and delays the social reconstruction so sorely needed in our day. These men consider a theistic philosophy</page><page sequence="11">366 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION as a means of escape from the tasks of this world by indulging in pleasant visions of a divine world. Professor M. C. Otto has given persuasive utterance to an antitheistic philosophy of life in his recent book, Things and Ideals. He quotes from a defense of religion by "one of the foremost scientists of our time," who rhetorically declares that if the theistic conception of meaning and purpose in the world be all a dream, this sci- entist asks to be permitted to "dream on forever." Such a statement seems to Professor Otto to indicate a cowardly atti- tude. Does theism lead one to prefer a consoling dream to a courageous facing of the facts when these facts are unpleas- ant? Professor Otto and others who, like him, are profoundly concerned to enlist idealism in the use of scientific control so as to further human welfare, feel that theism tempts gener- ous-minded people to spend their time and energy in trying to prove that God will somehow bring things out right. This kind of faith seems to them positively immoral in that it fur- nishes an excuse for evading the hard but imperative duty of devoting human intelligence to an analysis of the problems of social reconstruction. Says Professor Otto: "It has always been a step toward a more worthy social economy, toward a better general chance at a more fortunate existence, when men and women have refused to be put off with the promise of a supernatural recompense for actual earthly defeat; when they have dared to entrust their destiny to the social devices their combined aspiration and intelligence might invent." There is a measure of truth in this criticism. Who of us has not felt hot indignation at faith-healing which disparages medical science, at evangelism which induces hysteria or sen- timentalism, at pious resignation which refuses to become in- dignant at remediable social conditions? It is a wholesome thing for defenders of theism to be compelled to ask them- selves whether they are primarily interested in the mainte- nance of a religion of escape from the ills of this world. Are</page><page sequence="12">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 367 theists more concerned with a religion of consolation or with a religion of moral earnestness? This antitheistic philosophy seems to have an intellectual advantage in that it does not attempt to blink ugly facts. It argues frankly on the basis of what science seems to tell us concerning the universe, viz., that the cosmic process seems to be largely, if not utterly, indifferent to human ideals. If we simply accept this as a fact, we are done at one stroke with the "problem of evil" which has never been satisfactorily solved so long as it is assumed that the universe must be made to appear as the expression of a perfectly good purpose. The supreme task of humanity now comes to be, not the attempt to prove the existence of a good God who will somehow over- come evil, but rather the courageous attempt to unite all men in the co-operative enterprise of wresting from nature all the aid possible in furthering human welfare so long as there are humans on the planet. Such a program escapes the metaphys- ics of apologetic theology. In its eagerness to enlist men de- votedly in the crusade for a humanly better world, it becomes extremely impatient with the theologians who are distracting fine emotions by the lure of imaginary heavenly aid. Nevertheless, those who interpret theism as a sentimental refuge from the ills of life are quite wrong if they think that this is the typical Christian interpretation. Calvinism is per- haps the most thoroughgoing form of Christian theism; but no one will accuse Calvinism of a lack of ethical and social ener- gy. Modern theistic Christianity is conspicuously emphasiz- ing the "social gospel" in terms of devotion to God's will. It is, I believe, an entirely false assumption that theism usually induces a lessened interest in the human betterment of this world. At the same time, those who advocate theism must be on their guard against the defect which Professor Otto feels to be inherent, namely, the comfortable assumption that "God's in</page><page sequence="13">368 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION his heaven; all's right with the world." In the face of the un- deniable fact of the relentless and inviolable order of nature, a theism which is too eager to identify the loving God of Christian faith with the trend of the cosmic process may sub- stitute sentimentalism for social engineering. It may be seriously questioned, however, whether there is any real need of accepting quite so depressing a view of the cosmic order. Granted that supernaturalistic theism is too vulnerable, it is at least legitimate to inquire whether some modification of that theory may not suit the facts, when all the facts are taken into consideration. Humanity has been produced by the cosmos. The aspirations and activities of mankind are expressions of cosmic force, expressed through the functioning of an organism which nature has produced. Mankind can accomplish nothing save as he uses the forces of nature in accordance with limitations which nature herself imposes. Protest as we may against what we call the heartless- ness of nature, we cannot escape from nature. Is it not a true instinct which leads us to believe that we may in some fashion share the meaning of the cosmic process in our conscious ex- perience as truly as we are compelled to live physically in terms of nature's established processes? Is it quite satisfac- tory to affirm on the one hand the inescapable physical de- pendence of man on natural forces, but on the other hand to bid man in the evolution of his ethical and social life defy the very nature on which he is dependent? It is my conviction that such a dualism between the cosmos and the life of man can scarcely be successfully maintained. The majority of persons will continue to feel that man be- longs to the cosmic order in his spiritual as well as in his physi- cal existence. They will then either attempt to interpret the cosmic order in such a way as to feel that their moral enter- prises are in some sense supported by that order, or else they will conclude that since the cosmos is indifferent to spiritual values, they, as products of the cosmos, may also be indiffer-</page><page sequence="14">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 369 ent. I seriously question whether a merely naturalistic ideal- ism, declared to be something qualitatively different from the cosmic process, will actually engender the enthusiasm which these humanists expect. In the long run mankind will decide to have the universe on his side rather than to defy it. If it is clear that the cosmic process cares nothing for human ideals, man will adjust himself to the inevitable. And the inevitable, on this hypothesis, is a non-human heartless evolution. I should be much more afraid that such an antitheistic position would lead to moral indifference than I should be that theism would weaken moral idealism. An alluring proposal to disentangle religion from meta- physical theology without abandoning historical Christianity has been made by Professor E. S. Ames. He, like most Chris- tian leaders today, is supremely concerned to make religion a vital power in the moral and social reconstruction of human life. He would correlate religious devotion with the actual scientific and social forces dominant in our life. But he re- alizes that our Christian inheritance is an indispensable car- rier of religious idealism. He proposes therefore to reinterpret the familiar religious terms so as to make them vehicles for a social gospel. He suggests that while God is a reality in experience, he is a humanistic rather than a superhuman reality. Professor Ames holds that the history of religions shows that the god of any people is simply the pictorial representation of the group spirit. What is socially regarded as supremely desirable is given emotional power by picturing it as the purpose of a god who is solicitous for the welfare of the group. The god idea of Israel was evidently a reflection of the prevailing national hopes. In Christianity, the vanishing of monarchs as the guardians of group security has been accompanied by the weakening or the disappearance of the monarchical concep- tion of God. In a modern democracy our salvation depends on our own co-operative effort. There is no transcendent king</page><page sequence="15">370 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION who can save us. In modern democratic religion, our salvation must be worked out by social co-operation. The theology (if the word may be retained in the sense of an interpretation of religion) of Christianity today must express this supreme ideal of social co-operation. "God," therefore, stands for the spirit of the group which aspires to bring in the "Kingdom of God." He is as real as Alma Mater; but his reality is to be found in the realm of human society rather than in the realm of cosmic processes. The obvious advantage of this reinterpretation of the con- ception of God is that it enables Christian groups to continue to use familiar words and religious rituals which are fraught with great emotional power, while at the same time directing the emotion thus engendered toward the ethical and social ends so important in modern life. But in identifying God with purely humanistic ends the older theism is, of course, repudi- ated. It is, perhaps, impossible to expect logical consistency in stages of religious adjustment. There have been too many in- stances of the retention of words while radically altering the meaning of those words, for us to declare that the word "God" cannot be translated into exclusively humanistic meanings. But such a translation at present involves serious ambiguities. The frank position of Professor Otto is at least intelligible. Professor Ames takes a term which has always been used to indicate some kind of cosmic or superhuman support of man's hopes and uses it to give emotional drive to a social program which confessedly depends entirely on human enter- prise. The plain fact is that such a "God" has no jurisdiction over nature. He acts only in the aspirations and undertakings of the human group. Is religion then to ignore nature? Pro- fessor Ames attempts to meet this question by calling atten- tion to the fact that we know nature only in terms of a human- ly devised "world of discourse"; and he intimates that "the conception of God as the Spirit of the Group is not inconsist-</page><page sequence="16">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 371 ent with the thought of him also as the God of nature when nature is thought of as socially conditioned." This latter state- ment, however, gives small comfort to those who feel that re- ligion is not complete unless it enables man to feel at home in the universe which produced him. A "socially conditioned" nature is a conception fitted to do duty in epistemology rather than in practical religion. It is difficult to see just what the function of God would be here, unless we were to identify God with the spirit of devotion to science which binds together those who are interpreting nature. III Theism is an interpretation of the universe in terms of a philosophy which makes it possible for man to believe in a cosmic support of his ideals and values. I believe that this cosmic interest is an inescapable aspect of religion. Important as is the emphasis on human achievement, ultimately we are thrown back on the non-human forces of nature. We long to come to terms with that vast mysterious realm into which we must pass at death even if we have been partially protected from its ruthless hand by human devices during our life. The deepest springs of religious experience are in man's sense of dependence on the non-human cosmos. Theism attempts to make this experienced dependence a source of joy and con- fidence, and thus to set men free from cramping fear to engage in the nobler tasks of human enterprise. The importance and the value of this undertaking can scarcely be too highly com- mended. But philosophical theism is unconvincing to many people because of its very completeness. Has it not usually been more eager to give a theoretically complete definition of God than to face frankly all the facts? Is it not too essentially a priori to serve as the means of furthering the modern religious quest? Does it not seek to prove a thesis rather than to inter- pret the facts? Strictly speaking, theism assumes that all the</page><page sequence="17">372 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION varied processes in the evolution of the universe can be gath- ered up into a single divine purpose. Can this conception be maintained today in any except an apologetic fashion? Does theistic philosophy really seem convincing? We might as well frankly face the fact that "tough-mind- ed" persons have never been able to acquiesce in the doctrine of theistic control. It is comparatively easy to argue from the orderliness of the processes of nature, and from the fact that this order is intelligible, to the doctrine of an intelligent prin- ciple running through all nature. We may remark, however, in passing, that what we know of the evolutionary process seems to suggest an endless series of experiments rather than a clearly defined rational goal. Still, it is not here that the greatest difficulty is felt. It is the age-old problem of evil which creates doubts. If we take the facts as we find them, we are compelled to recognize that the cosmic process seems to be largely indifferent to moral values. A theism which con- tents itself merely with the notion of an intelligible universe can make out a fairly good case. A theism which seeks to es- tablish such a cosmic solicitude for human welfare as has been attributed to the Christian God has an extremely difficult task. It is this modern recognition of the apparently heartless character of the cosmos that has led to the conception of a "finite God," who preserves the quality of love by declining to assume responsibility for the cosmos as a whole. The difficul- ties in the way of exactly identifying this finite God are obvi- ous. Nevertheless, most of the Christian interpretations of God today really approximate this conception of finiteness. We no longer expect God to alter in any way the inexorable course of nature. We no longer attempt to connect earthquakes with God. The almost complete absence of attempts at a theologi- cal explanation of the great earthquake in Japan is a phenom- enon worthy of serious consideration. The activity of God ac- cording to modern representations is restricted almost exclu-</page><page sequence="18">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 373 sively to his ability to help men meet whatever fate they must meet with spiritual triumph. God's activity is found in his power to create in man generous and high-minded courage. The cosmic order is really more or less of an enigma to the modern theologian. Even when he bravely attempts to con- tinue the theistic arguments of the past, sooner or later we find in his confessions of ignorance something like the "veiled being" of H. G. Wells. I am inclined to believe that theologians in the near future will adopt a more inductive approach to the problem of defin- ing the nature of the cosmic object of religious worship. They will state the problems of religious thinking in terms of human adjustment to environment, rather than in terms of a doctrine of theistic control. The character of God will be found in the experienced reciprocity between man and his environment, rather than in the realm of metaphysical causation. The mod- ern trend in theology is decidedly in the direction of exploring mysticism rather than in a dependence on philosophy. We think of life as an adjustment between organism and environment. Religion is an aspect of this life-process. The problem to be faced is as to the kind of adjustment which is possible. Shall it be conceived as making the best terms possi- ble with an indifferent or hostile cosmos? Or is it possible to make an adjustment of such a kind that in it there is an expe- rience of spiritual oneness with the cosmic mystery-an expe- rience which gives to life unspeakable fulness and meaning? If the latter kind of adjustment is possible, there has been a religious discovery of God. Such a discovery I believe to be possible and supremely desirable. While I would not refuse to recognize the right of a less mystical adjustment to claim the name of religion; while I recognize genuine Christianity-of a kind-in the humanistic zeal of some antitheistic writers; nevertheless I cannot but feel that there is a spiritual pro- fundity in the mystical interpretation which is relatively lack- ing in idealisms which attempt to get along without God.</page><page sequence="19">374 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION In religion man brings his highest ideals and his most pre- cious values into the presence of that vast cosmic mystery which has produced him and which holds him in its power. He seeks to obtain from this cosmic power some kind of a blessing on these values and ideals. Thus far interpreters of religion would probably agree. They would also probably agree that as a result of this relating of his ideals and values to the cosmic mystery, man experiences a sense of satisfaction. To what is this sense of satisfaction due? Is it purely a psy- chological process due to the projection of one's hopes and desires in an imaginative personalization? Or is there a real reciprocity between the worshiping individual and his cosmic environment? The testimony of religious souls points to a real reciproc- ity. It is, of course, true that epistemological analysis will de- stroy a naively realistic conception of the other side of this reciprocal experience. But epistemology has done this for the physical world so often that we are ceasing to be disturbed by the inevitable "egocentric" factor in any interpretation. We are quite willing to recognize that our conceptions of physical reality are symbolic rather than descriptive. Nevertheless, so long as we can continue to use them in our actual dealings with the world, we have no practical doubt as to the objective existence of that world. If any particular conception comes to be involved in too great difficulties, we simply modify it, or even abandon it for another. Is not the case somewhat similar in the realm of religion? If the theistic hypothesis becomes too difficult to maintain, may we not abandon it for some more suitable conception without thereby abandoning our belief in some kind of cosmic reality capable of stimulating in us the experiences which we call religious? The theistic hypothesis suffers from being too definite to suit our rapidly enlarging knowledge of the nature of the cos- mos. It is too thoroughly rationalized. One of the common experiences of today is the sense of unutterable wonder as the</page><page sequence="20">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 375 incalculable spaces disclosed by astronomy and the unimag- inable stretches of time suggested by the doctrine of evolution and the almost incredible marvels of atomic structure and ac- tion are apprehended. What we know suggests powerfully the mysteries which we do not, and perhaps cannot, know. A the- istic theology seems to many a person to belittle the religious relationship by fitting it too neatly into the categories of hu- man logic. Poetry, symbolism, wordless adoration, seem more truly to interpret our relationship to the cosmic order than does a system depicting precise theological control. Do we really want to believe in a God who is too completely ration- alized? Moreover, when we attempt to construct some theory of the cosmos which shall do justice to all that we know, we are compelled to acknowledge that our humanity seems like a rather minor incident in the total cosmic process. As Professor Everett has suggested, we seem forced by the facts to think of the universe as an empire comprising many kingdoms, rath- er than as a single kingdom the purpose of which is to make man the goal of the evolutionary process. When we have said all that we can concerning the capacity of man to master the conditions of living, we are compelled to recognize that there are some processes inexorably going on which seem either in- different or hostile to human welfare, and which man is ap- parently powerless to effect. The universe is "an empire with many kingdoms." And yet humanity finds its values and ideals so precious that it dares to bring these in religious aspiration into rela- tionship with the great cosmic mystery, believing that through such relationship cosmic support may be obtained. The belief in God means that there may be found, not merely within the circle of human society, but also in the non-human envi- ronment on which we are dependent, a quality of the cosmic process akin to the quality of our own spiritual life. Through communion with this qualitative aspect of the cosmic process</page><page sequence="21">376 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION human life attains an experience of dignity, and a reinforce- ment of spiritual power. The quality of this reinforcement can be adequately expressed only by the conception of a Di- vine Presence in the cosmic order. Theism undertook to give rational form to precisely this religious experience in an age when problems were solved by philosophy rather than by scientific experiment. As between theism and antitheism, the theist is doubtless nearer right. But it is questionable whether theism of the usual type will continue to be a convincing way of stating a religious view of the world, when once the world is apprehended in terms of our modern science. Religion for men who think in this fashion will consist in a great mystic experiment rather than in the acceptance of a theological system. The religious man will, under modern conditions, have many a doubt concerning the objective reality of what the theologians call God. He may, for a time, seek to find satisfaction in purely humanistic aspiration. But the relation of humanity to the vast and awful forces and processes disclosed by modern science is an insist- ent and haunting problem. The mind which has discovered the marvels of the incalculably vast and complicated universe will not be content merely to describe what it finds. It will de- mand some kind of spiritual fellowship with the non-human as well as with the human. Just what conception of God will ultimately emerge from the great experiment we cannot yet tell. But it will express the experience of kinship between man and that quality in environment which supports and enriches humanity in its spiritual quest. God will be very real to the religious man, but his reality will be interpreted in terms of social reciprocity with an as yet inadequately defined cosmic support of human values, rather than in terms of theistic cre- atorship and control. The experience of God will take the form of comradeship with that aspect of our non-human en- vironment which is found to reinforce and to enrich our life. Anthropomorphic symbols will be frankly used to promote</page><page sequence="22">IS THEISM ESSENTIAL TO RELIGION? 377 that experience, but they will not be pressed into exact the- ological descriptions. Those expressions of divine solicitude for man which Christianity has incorporated into its doc- trine of God will probably continue to characterize religious thought. But a too definite theistic philosophy will suffer from the disadvantage of encountering adverse criticism at the hands of scientists and psychologists. An apologetic for the- ism is likely to betray more or less clearly the fact that the doctrine stands related to too finished and static a conception of reality to seem really convincing to men who think in terms of evolutionary science. A more promising method of ap- proach seems to me to be the frank recognition of the fact that our religious relationship to what we worship in our cos- mic environment must be empirically studied, and our con- ception of God must be formulated in tentative terms which grow out of that experience, rather than in terms of an a priori philosophy assuming to be final. Men may believe in God without being able to define God.</page></plain_text>
