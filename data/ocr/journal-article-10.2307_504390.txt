<plain_text><page sequence="1">Middle Chalcolithic Pottery from Southwestern Anatolia CHRISTINE ESLICK Abstract The various sequences constructed for the Chalco- lithic period in southwestern Anatolia are based on two sites, Beycesultan and Hacilar. Each produced evidence of a well defined material culture and these were attributed to the Early Chalcolithic and Late Chalcolithic respectively. However, there was no ob- servable relationship between them. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain the lack of continuity -an invasion, at the end of the Hacilar period, that brought the fully developed Late Chalcolithic cul- ture into the Southwest, or a hiatus between Hacilar and Beycesultan that lasted for much of the fifth millennium b.c. Pottery that fits into none of the known Southwest Anatolian traditions has recently been identified in the Elmall Plain. It is described and attributed, on the basis of internal evidence and parallels with pottery from the eastern Aegean is- lands, to the fifth millennium. Support is thereby given to the "hiatus" theory, and the incompleteness of our knowledge of the Chalcolithic period empha- sized. The repercussions for our understanding of this period, both in Anatolia and the Aegean, are discussed. INTRODUCTION-HACILAR AND BEYCESULTAN Current interpretations of the Chalcolithic pe- riod in southwestern Anatolia are based almost solely on the excavated sequences from Beycesultan and Hacilar.' These sites each produced a culture that has been assigned to the period, although there was no similarity between them, and no overlap of the cultures at either site. The large mound of Beycesultan produced a long series of Bronze Age levels with, below them, twenty levels (XL-XX) that were termed Late Chalcolithic. These levels, reached only in sound- ing SX, yielded the remains of a culture ancestral to that of the Bronze Age levels. The houses were built of mudbrick and contained built benches, bins and fixed hearths. The units were all recti- linear, but there seemed to be no fixed house plan.2 The Late Chalcolithic pottery was competently made in a limited range of simple shapes. The wide bowls and flat-mouthed jugs were burnished and sometimes had white painted decoration on a dark ground. The large jars were neither burnished nor decorated. A hoard from level XXXIV showed that copper was used for needles, awls and knives, and that the use of silver was also known. Clay loomweights, spindle whorls/beads and animal fig- urines, bone points and scrapers, stone axes and obsidian and flint chipped implements completed the assemblage.3 The nine levels excavated at Hacilar showed the steady development of a completely different cul- ture. The final level, level I, is most important in discussing relationships with Beycesultan. It con- sisted, in its main phase, of a massively constructed mudbrick complex, apparently of more than one storey. The communal organization displayed in this level could also be observed in the earlier levels of the site, where party walls were used and the village area was clearly delimited. Fixed hearths and ovens were found in all these levels.4 The Hacilar pottery displays a steady develop- ment from level IX. In the earlier levels it was mainly monochrome and tended to incurved 1 This article is based on part of my Ph.D. dissertation, "The Neolithic and Chalcolithic Pottery of the Elmali Plain, South- western Turkey," submitted to Bryn Mawr College in 1978.

I. Sites mentioned in the text shapes. Increasingly, painted designs were used on the pottery and the shapes became more open. By level I most of the pottery had painted designs and the most common shapes were carinated bowls and jars with wide or collar necks. Red on cream was the usual color scheme; a white on dark variant oc- curred, but was very rare. Anthropomorphic figu- rines were found in most levels at Hacilar, and in the better preserved lower levels the ground stone and bone industries were well developed. Metal was apparently not much used.5 The material culture of Hacilar level I cannot be seen as an impoverishment of the culture of the earlier levels. There are some differences in the ar- chitectural arrangements and the designs and shapes of the pottery, but there is no indication that the traditions represented there are declining. For example, the red on white painted pottery is still increasing in popularity.6 The Hacllar material culture was thus very dif- ferent from that found at Beycesultan. The archi- tectural arrangements of the site suggest a society with a stronger community organization than at Late Chalcolithic Beycesultan. This is reflected both in the overall planning of the settlement and in the greater uniformity in the plan and organi- 5 Hacilar I 99-185. 6 Hacilar I oo00.</page><page sequence="3">1980] MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC POTTERY 7 zation of the individual units. There are also many differences in the technologies employed at the two sites. Ovens were found in most houses at Hacilar but were not part of the normal household ar- rangements at Beycesultan, where flat baking pans were common from level XXXI. The ground stone industries at the two sites did not belong to the same tradition.' The impoverishment of the chipped stone at Beycesultan was undoubtedly due in part 'to the use there of metal. At Beycesultan baked clay loomweights attest to the use of the warp-weighted loom; they did not occur at Hacl- lar. Finally the pottery of the 'two sites differs not only in the surface finish and the shapes, but also in the manufacturing methods used. Grit temper was employed at Hacilar and fiber temper at Beycesultan, while the plug method of handle at- tachment used at Beycesultan did not occur at Hacilar. The Hacilar culture was labelled Late Neolithic (levels IX-VI with predominantly monochrome pottery) and Early Chalcolithic (levels V-I with increasing proportions of painted pottery) on the basis of long range comparisons with the sequence at Mersin in Cilicia.8 Implicit in the use of this terminology was that Hacilar was earlier than Late Chalcolithic Beycesultan. As the sequence at Beyce- sultan continues uninterrupted into the Bronze Age, this was a reasonable assumption, and is not seriously disputed.' Moreover, the existence of pot- tery similar to that of Beycesultan Late Chalco- lithic (and later) in the Hacilar area, but not at Hacilar itself, makes any overlap in the temporal distribution of the two cultures unlikely. Some small degree of overlapping would be possible only if the Hacilar tradition had continued at other sites, after the abandonment of the Hacilar I mound."' It is, therefore, generally accepted that Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic was later than Hacl- lar, but the major differences between the two cul- tures rule out any possibility of the culture of Late Chalcolithic Beycesultan having been a direct suc- cessor to that of Hacilar. Attempts to regard the Hacilar and Beycesultan cultures as the full sequence for the Southwest Anatolian Chalcolithic have, ,therefore, run into difficulties. Mellaart, in order to have Beycesultan level XL follow directly after Hacilar level I, sug- gested a sudden invasion of people, from outside the Southwest, who brought the fully developed Late Chalcolithic culture with them.1" This view would be more acceptable if a place of origin for the invasion could be pointed out, but the develop- ment of the Late Chalcolithic culture cannot yet be traced in any area. Until such a development can be demonstrated, the alternative view, of an inter- val of some length between the end of Hacilar level I and the beginning of Beycesultan level XL, must be accepted as more likely. It is supported by the few radiocarbon dates we have.12 They place the Hacilar culture sequence in the sixth millen- nium b.c. and the Late Chalcolithic culture in the fourth. If a gap of this magnitude is allowed, there is no need to hypothesize an invasion bringing a fully developed Late Chalcolithic culture into the Southwest. A more gradual replacement of the Hacilar culture is possible. One important argument against this proposed gap in the sequence has been the complete absence, despite considerable archaeological activity in the area, of any material that could be placed in the fifth millennium b.c.

KIZILBEL AND LOWER BAGBA?I POTTERY The Elmall Plain is a fertile and well watered plain in the Taurus Mountains west of Antalya. Access is easy to the Korkuteli Plain in the north and, from there, routes lead to the Burdur area and down to the coast at Antalya. Passes also lead from the Elmall Plain to the south coast at Finike and Kas, but they are more difficult than the route to Korkuteli. The Neolithic-Chalcolithic sequence in the El- mall Plain is still only partially known, but surveys have produced pottery of Hacilar Late Neolithic type and some sherds that may be from a local Early Chalcolithic culture. Late Chalcolithic pot- tery of types similar to Beycesultan Late Chalco- lithic 1-3 has also been found at a number of places, including the excavated sites of Karaburun, Boz- tepe and Bagbasl.13 The general Hacllar-Beycesul- tan sequence thus is undoubtedly applicable to the plain, but two groups of pottery found there have no parallels in that sequence. The first pottery group was unearthed during the excavation of the late sixth century B.C. painted tomb at Kizilbel. This site lies on the end of the high ridge of Uzunburun, which projects southwards into the plain, 5-5 km. southwest of the town of Elmall. It overlooked the Karagol, a marshy lake that has only recently been drained. The pottery under discussion was not directly associated with the tomb, but was found both in the tumulus which covered the tomb chamber and scattered over the surface of the ridge. None of the pottery was found in an undisturbed context and, in fact, the deposits from which it derived have been completely removed, either by the builders of the tumulus or by erosion. There is, however, no reason to doubt that this pottery is from an early occupation of the ridge. During the study of the pottery from the Late Chalcolithic settlement at Bagbasl, material similar to the Klzllbel wares in fabric and shapes was iso- lated. Bagbasl is 7 km. northeast of Elmahl and is on a low natural hill overlooking the lower part of the plain to the east. A small perennial stream now runs around the northern side of the rise. Eighteen trenches were opened in this area and all contained Late Chalcolithic remains, but the pottery dis- cussed here came almost exclusively from the lower levels of trench i i16, on the highest part of the rise. A few fragments were also found in the next trench, o105. This pottery was not associated with the Late Chalcolithic floor levels in either of these trenches and is probably from an earlier oc- cupation of the site. It is, accordingly, termed Lower Baibasl to distinguish it from the pottery of the main settlement. It was not associated with any architectural features, and the disturbed nature of the deposits at the site makes a more precise deter- mination of its position difficult. The pottery from both Kizilbel and Lower Bag- basl is handmade and rather coarse, although denser than the Late Chalcolithic wares from the plain. Considerable amounts of grits were left in the clay by the potter and there are traces of a very small amount of fiber, but this was not necessarily included deliberately. The pots were poorly fired and black cores are usual. The surface color varies from red to black, with red and orange predomi- nating at Kizilbel and light brown at Balkbasl. The surface was well smoothed to give a compact, smooth finish without achieving a high luster. The pot bases are flat and thick; the ends of the handles are scored and applied to a similarly scored area of the pot. The range of shapes is limited. Hole-mouth pots and bowls with flat rims and curved sides are the most common, and there are jars with short pulled- up necks. Handles are usually of the strap variety, placed either on the rim of a bowl or on the body of a closed vessel. Each site also produced one small lug. From Kizilbel come some pans with a row of piercings below the rim, and a stand frag- ment (ill. 2-6). There was little decoration on these pots. Single knobs occur on three strap handles from Kizilbel and one body sherd from Bakbasl. Two of the strap handles from Bagbasl have slight ridges pinched up across the top, and a number of sherds from that site, probably from one pot, bear evi- dence of red painted decoration.

Middle Chalcolithic pottery bowl has diagonal impressions across the rim, and incised lines or dashes are found on three sherds. The main indicator of the date of these pottery groups is the stratigraphic position of the Lower Bagbasi pottery, apparently predating the Late Chalcolithic occupation. The Bagbasi Late Chalco- lithic can be equated with Beycesultan Late Chalco- lithic 2-3, and pottery similar to Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic i has also been found in the Elmall Plain. Moreover, as mentioned above, at least two sites have produced survey material of Hacilar Late Neolithic and possibly Early Chalcolithic types.

Middle Chalcolithic pottery ture of the paint were not typical of that phase (ill. 3:22). Therefore, the possibility of coexistence with the Late Neolithic cannot be excluded, but the lack of pottery of Kizilbel-Lower Bagbasi types at the Neolithic sites makes it unlikely. The dating of this pottery prior to the Late Neo- lithic is also improbable. Pottery that can be at- tributed to -the Early Neolithic period has yet to be identified in the Elmall Plain, but the Kizilbel and Lower Bagbasi wares bear no resemblance to those from elsewhere in the southwest.14 The prevalence of hole-mouth shapes and flat-rimmed curved-sided bowls might indeed be -taken as an indicator of an early date, but this is offset by the presence of such features as loop and strap handles, pierced-sided pans and the use of knob decoration. 14E.

Middle Chalcolithic pottery The tradition in which the Kizilbel and Lower Baigbasi pottery was made is certainly closer to the Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic tradition than to the Late Chalcolithic. The comparatively careful prep- aration, the grit temper and the method of handle application all attest to this. Some of the shapes-- the hole-mouth series, -the flaring bowl with flat rim, the various jar necks, the vessel with internal ledge--can be paralleled at Hacilar, but there are no parallels there for the characteristic features of this Elmall pottery. The plain, unslipped surfaces and strap handles, in particular, are missing.'5 The relationship can be best described as remote. The dating of the Kizilbel and Lower Bagbasi pottery from internal evidence is inconclusive. It cannot be closely related to either the Late Neo- lithic-Early Chalcolithic tradition or to the Late 13 11 14 15 LOWER BA6BASI ILL. 5. Middle Chalcolithic pottery Chalcolithic tradition. As, however, it should be pre-Late Chalcolithic and is unlikely to be Early Neolithic, a position in the sequence between Early and Late Chalcolithic seems probable. RELATIONS WITH THE EAST AEGEAN Although pottery of exactly the same types as those from Kizilbel and Lower Baigbasi has not yet been found outside the Elmall Plain, close parallels for many of the features can be found in the is- lands of the eastern Aegean. The earliest levels at Emporio on Chios (levels X-IX) produced parallels for the Kizilbel hole- mouth and incurved shapes, the pans with high sides and row of piercings below the rim, the strap handles decorated with knobs and placed either on bowl rims or on the sides of jars. Also similar is the 15 The Hacilar parallels are: Hacilar II figs. 46: 48:29; 53:14, 17 and 49:13; 53:3 respectively.</page><page sequence="7">1980] MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC POTTERY 11 L b6 LOWER BAGBASI 16 ILL. 6. Middle Chalcolithic pottery infrequent use of simple incised decoration with- out white filling. Many of these features, such as the pans and knobbed handles, have a long life at Emporio, continuing even to levels VII and VI, but it is in these earliest levels, before the more widespread use of pattern burnish and incision in level VIII, that the assemblage as a whole is com- parable to that from Kizilbel.'6 Similar shapes are also found in the repertoire at Tigani on Samos where incurved bowls, hole- mouth jars, knobbed strap handles and pans with a row of piercings below the rim were all found. They belong to the coarse unburnished wares, either un- decorated or decorated with incision. A bowl with high strap handle also occurs, but it is rare.7 These same pottery types were found in the cave sites on Kalymnos, and high strap handles, though without knobs, and pans with a row of piercings below the rim occur amongst the pottery in the deposits of the Aspripetra cave on Kos.'8 These latter deposits are probably to be dated to the Late Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age, but they again demonstrate the island distributions of these fea- tures.'9 Coarse pots with a row of piercings below the rim have a wide distribution in the later Neo- lithic of the Aegean.20 The Lower Ba'basi pottery has few parallels with other sites. Its most distinctive feature, the strap handle with a pinched-up ridge (as distinct from the more common horned handle), has been found only at Tigani and Saliagos.21 It thus pro- vides some confirmation of the Kizilbel evidence. The dating of most of this Aegean material is far from certain. Stratified remains were found only at Emporio. Level VII at that site, with its rolled rim bowls, must be compared with the Okumtepe IB phase of the Northwest Anatolian Late Chalcolithic and, as there is no evidence of a gap in the deposits, level VIII should belong to the period immediately before that. The occurrence in level VIII of pattern burnishing comparable to that of Besikatepe, an earlier Late Chalcolithic phase in northwestern Anatolia, is further confirmation of this dating.22 Levels IX and X, with which we are mainly concerned here, should therefore belong to a period before Besikatepe.

The bulk of it is Late Chalcolithic, but class A, to which the Kizilbel parallels belong, does not include definite Late Chalcolithic material. Its parallels are rather with Emporio IX and X. It seems likely that this site had a longer period of occupation than has sometimes been thought.24 The precise correlation of pottery phases over any distance is a dubious exercise, for even if simi- larities are due to direct contact (and cases such as that under discussion, where long distances are in- volved, are more likely to have been due to indirect contact produced by village-to-village interaction), there is no guarantee that the life of the feature, or its popularity curve, will be the same in both places. However, in the absence of more concrete factors, such correlations must be used. The Kizilbel-related pottery at Emporio occurs in a phase between the Late Neolithic and the Late Chalcolithic. A more precise definition is impos- sible. Early Chalcolithic painted pottery seems to have had a much more restricted distribution than the Late Neolithic pottery types. Monochrome varieties continued well into the Early Chalcolithic period in many areas of southwestern Anatolia.25 The Aghio Gala pottery may, therefore, be equiva- lent to the mainland Late Neolithic or Early Chal- colithic, and Emporio IX-X equated wi.th Hacilar Early Chalcolithic and later, or only with the post- Hacilar period. SOUTHWEST ANATOLIA IN THE FIFTH MILLENNIUM b.c. Examination of the Kizilbel and Lower Bagbasl pottery showed that it probably belonged to the period between the Elmah Plain equivalents of the Hacilar Early Chalcolithic and Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic phases. The related pottery from Chios must be Early Chalcolithic or later, but is certainly to be dated before the Late Chalcolithic. It confirms the Elmall evidence and, accordingly, a Middle Chalcolithic phase should be recognized in the Elmali Plain. Since such a small amount of this pottery has yet been found, it is impossible to suggest how the pot- tery tradition developed. An origin in the Hacilar tradition is not impossible. As has been demon- strated above, the Elmall Middle Chalcolithic pot- tery tradition is closer to that of the Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic than to that of the Late Chalco- lithic. Early Chalcolithic pottery, especially that re- lated to Hacilar levels VII-VI, had a wide distribu- tion that included the eastern Aegean and the Elmall Plain.26 It must be noted, however, that many of the features that link ithe Elmall Middle Chalcolithic and the Aegean groups are not de- rived from that source-e.g. the strap handles, use of knob decoration, surface finish and pans with pierced sides. These suggest that the Aegean and Elmall occurrences are not likely to be solely the result of parallel development based on the Hacilar tradition, and make some contact necessary be- tween Elmah and the Aegean in the post-Hacilar period. There are two geographical routes by which this contact could have taken place. The first would have been via the valley of the Biiyiik Menderes, and then southwards through the Burdur area to Elmall. If this were the case, we would expect to find some evidence of related pottery types in these areas. Despite considerable archaeological activity in at least some parts of the Southwest, none has yet been found.27 Moreover, a number of sites in the area-Aphrodisias, Derek*y I, Hacilar II, Kurugay H6yiik-have produced pottery of both Hacilar and Beycesultan types, with no material that could be regarded as Middle Chalcolithic.28 23 Furness (supra n. 18) 195, fig. 12.

French, "Early Pottery Sites from Western Anatolia," BIA 5 [19651 18-I9 and figs. 3-4) resembles the Kizilbel pottery in many respects. The lightly burnished fabric of the Moralh sherds has a similar appearance to the Kizilbel pottery, and shapes such as the hole-mouth series and the flat rimmed bowl are common to both. However Moralh lacks the distinctive strap handles and pans with pierced sides. The site has been dated to the Neo- lithic period, and the resemblances to Kizilbel are probably due only to the fact that many of the Middle Chalcolithic features were drawn from the Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic repertoire. 28 This material is mostly unpublished.

They produced no architectural remains, and no finds except a small amount of pottery. The Elmall material was only recovered because it was found in the course of excavation for other purposes. The possibility that similar sites will be discovered in other areas must still be considered, especially as they will probably be on high ground around the edges of the plains and not on the plains themselves. The alternative distribution would be coastal, along the western and southwestern coasts of the mainland and the offshore islands, with penetra- tion to the Elmali Plain from the south coast. Pot- tery made in this -tradition has not yet been found in the Dodecanese or in the coastal areas of Tur- key. However this does not eliminate the possibil- ity of such a distribution. To the ephemeral nature of the Middle Chalcolithic sites must be added the observation that the coastal areas are not conducive to the discovery of prehistoric remains. Sites on the plains would have been effectively covered by the many meters of alluvial deposit that have accumu- lated since the fifth millennium, and sites on the hill slopes would have been eroded away.29 The contacts that must have taken place between the Elmall Plain and the eastern Aegean could, therefore, have taken place by either or both of these routes. Neither can be ruled out. The Elmall Middle Chalcolithic pottery demon- strates 'the incompleteness of the Hacilar-Beyce- sultan sequence. It shows that an intermediate phase existed in at least one area of the southwest, which, moreover, in both the preceding and fol- lowing phases participated in the general pottery trends of the whole region. As discussed above, the Hacilar-Beycesultan sequence has not been adequately demonstrated by excavation, and it de- pends on the finds at two sites that are situated some ioo km. apart and in different geographical areas-Hacilar to the south of the Burdur lake and Beycesultan beside the upper part of the Biiyiik Menderes River. It is a general sequence only and its details will be constantly amended as more local sequences are established. Of equal importance is the support this new pot- tery gives to the hypothesis of a long gap between Hacilar I and Beycesultan XL. The length of the Middle Chalcolithic phase cannot yet be estab- lished, but at least part of the fifth millennium b.c. must be reserved for it, and the span allotted to the Late Chalcolithic period restricted accord- ingly. The Kizilbel-Lower Bagbasl pottery tradition is probably based, at least in part, on the Hacilar tra- dition to which it shows some similarities in manu- facturing technique and shape. It would also ap- pear to have played some part, even if a small one, in the formation of the Elmall Late Chalcolithic pottery tradition. For example, pans with pierced sides were associated with bowls of Late Chalco- lithic I types at Boztepe in the Elmali Plain.30 More Middle Chalcolithic pottery must be identi- fied before it can be used to clarify the relationship between Early Chalcolithic and Late Chalcolithic pottery, but there do seem to be indications that local factors were more important than has been thought in the formation of that Late Chalcolithic pottery. Finally it may be pertinent to mention the ques- tion of Anatolian-Aegean relations in general. It is clear, and not surprising in view of their proxim- ity, that the islands along the Anatolian coast shared the same pottery traditions as the mainland throughout the Chalcolithic period. When more is known of the coastal varieties of pottery, the re- semblances will no doubt be seen to be even greater. This applies to the Middle as well as to the Early and Late Chalcolithic.

French for allowing me to see this collection which includes pottery from the Hacilar and Beycesultan excavations and from many surveys in western Anatolia. 29 The Early Bronze Age pottery found at Seyret near the south coast during survey by M.J. Mellink is the only prehis- toric pottery so far found in the coastal areas. There is no doubt about its identification despite the view of J. Mellaart (supra n. 25) 177 and note 3. 30 This agrees with the evidence of continuity from levels IX to VIII and thence to VII and VI at Emporio.</page><page sequence="10">14 CHRISTINE ESLICK [AJA 84 land and areas farther to the west is, however, doubtful. The Saliagos pottery, which is approxi- mately contemporary with the Middle Chalcolithic of Elmall, has little similarity even to the pottery of the eastern islands. The only parallels with the Elmall Middle Chalcolithic pottery-diagonal im- pressions on pot rims and handles with a pinched- up ridge or knob decoration-are not sufficient, in view of the overall dissimilarity of the assemblages, to establish a connection.31 5 RUPERT STREET MOUNT COLAH, N.S.W. 2079 AUSTRALIA 31 Evans and Renfrew (supra n. 21) 42-43 and fig. 42:5; 39 and fig. 45:3-6.</page></plain_text>
